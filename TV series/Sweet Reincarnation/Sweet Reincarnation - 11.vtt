00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.300 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh? Please explain.

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:18.634 position:44% line:83% align:start
Unh!
What my dear son is doing.

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:21.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
[grunts] He's working on
some kind of treat.

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:24.167 position:38% line:83% align:start
[grunts]
I don't quite understand.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
[grunts] But it clearly involves
whipping egg whites.

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:29.133 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:31.767 position:35% line:83% align:start
The boy has
been at it all day!

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:34.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh! Not a bad strategy

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.267 position:30% line:83% align:start
for pumping up
those tiny biceps!

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.067 position:7% line:89% align:start
[scoffs] I'm afraid not, gents.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.000 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasp]

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.167 position:33% line:83% align:start
-It can't be!
-Not one fiber of muscle's

00:00:44.267 --> 00:00:45.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
[confused groan]

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.501 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
Impressive, yes?

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:49.901 position:27% line:83% align:start
They're still so
slender and delicate.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:51.501 position:35% line:89% align:start
By design!

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:53.834 position:7% line:83% align:start
Repetitive tasks like whipping
eggs result in something

00:00:53.968 --> 00:00:56.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
special known as STMF!

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.400 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[clucking]
-"Some thin, meek fowl"?

00:00:58.534 --> 00:01:01.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
It stands for "slow-twitch
muscle fibers."

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:03.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
By intentionally subjecting
my arms to such prolonged,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.667 position:7% line:83% align:start
low-burden exercise, I develop
lithe yet firm arms

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:08.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
that aren't hampered
by bulging muscles,

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:10.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
no offense intended
to present company.

00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:12.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Oh... Hm?
-But there's more!

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:14.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
One of the most
critical factors in muscle

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
development is diet.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:17.934 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ah... [chomping]

00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:20.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
The majority of my calories
in sweets come from complex

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:22.200 position:10% line:89% align:start
carbohydrates and tasty fats.

00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:24.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
They all have little
to no protein to speak of.

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:26.334 position:35% line:83% align:start
My muscles
don't stand a chance.

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:28.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
I order you to eat
real food from now on!

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:30.267 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[Pas groans]
-Got it?

[NARRATOR] This is the tale
of a genius pÃ¢tissier,

00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:36.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
whose dream of making
the world's greatest

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.934 position:19% line:89% align:start
dessert was cut short.

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:40.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now, reincarnated into another
realm as the son of a poor

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:44.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
noble, he pursues a world
full of desserts and smiles!

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
A tale that's syrupy sweet,
chock full of yummy treats,

00:01:48.701 --> 00:01:51.234 position:33% line:83% align:start
and sprinkled
with bitter darkness.

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:53.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
A pastry chef,
who was reborn,

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:56.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
and dreams of creating
this new world's,

00:01:56.434 --> 00:01:59.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
very own land of sweets!

00:03:30.534 --> 00:03:32.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
It seems a war has
broken out in the east.

[gasps]

00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:37.300 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE] The border conflict
between Hubarek's lands

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:40.434 position:10% line:83% align:start
and their neighbor Lutoroute
has finally boiled over.

00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:46.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
I come bearing news.

00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:49.200 position:7% line:83% align:start
There has not been so much as a
whisper of reinforcements

00:03:49.334 --> 00:03:51.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
from the duke's estate
in the royal capital.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.367 position:44% line:83% align:start
Hmph!
Just as expected.

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:56.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
The moment they heard the
false rumor that our army

00:03:56.968 --> 00:03:58.501 position:13% line:89% align:start
was thirty-thousand strong.

00:03:58.634 --> 00:04:01.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hubarek would have had no
choice but to request aid

00:04:01.334 --> 00:04:02.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
from Kadlecek.

00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:04.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
The fact that it
hasn't materialized

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.767 position:16% line:89% align:start
means one of two things.

00:04:05.901 --> 00:04:07.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
Perhaps the duke turned
him down or it's possible

00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:11.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
the Hubareks withdrew their
request for aid, like fools.

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:13.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
[LUTOROUTE] I guarantee
it's the latter.

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:15.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
Once he became aware that
we have only ten-thousand

00:04:15.834 --> 00:04:18.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
soldiers, he'd have chosen
to handle us himself

00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:20.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
in a sorry attempt
to save face.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
He'll wish to avoid
large-scale

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.667 position:33% line:83% align:start
participation
by the ducal house.

00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:27.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
A withdrawal. I doubt the duke
would appreciate that.

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:30.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's safe to assume
it was a source of conflict.

00:04:30.734 --> 00:04:31.934 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gulping]

00:04:32.067 --> 00:04:34.334 position:38% line:83% align:start
[exhales]
Wait and see, Hubarek.

00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:37.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
I will be the one to
settle this grudge of ours,

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
by destroying you!

00:04:39.934 --> 00:04:42.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
M'lord! I have just received
word regarding

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.801 position:7% line:89% align:start
the Hubarek daughter's fiancÃ©.

00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:48.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
It seems he is currently
stationed in the margravate.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.400 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh. The duke's
precious grandson.

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:03.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[LICORICE] Hello, Pas!
-Huh!

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:05.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is there something
troubling you?

00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:07.167 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:09.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
You look a bit
lost in thought.

00:05:09.634 --> 00:05:13.100 position:38% line:83% align:start
Who, me?
Nah, I'm fine, just fine!

00:05:13.234 --> 00:05:14.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
Be honest.

00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:18.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
The war is weighing heavily
on your mind, is it not?

00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:21.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hear there's conflict
breaking out between

00:05:21.234 --> 00:05:24.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
my homeland and its
neighboring territory.

00:05:24.934 --> 00:05:26.901 position:33% line:83% align:start
-I believe...
-[PAS] Hm?

00:05:27.868 --> 00:05:31.133 position:10% line:83% align:start
We share the same sentiment,
that war is no more than

00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:33.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
a foolish waste of life.

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.234 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not fair.

00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:38.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why must people senselessly
fight and kill each other?

00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:40.901 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:43.501 position:7% line:83% align:start
Instead of waging war upon one
another, they could all spend

00:05:43.634 --> 00:05:45.901 position:27% line:83% align:start
their days making
delicious sweets.

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:49.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
If they could lose themselves
in it the way that you do.

00:05:49.634 --> 00:05:51.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
Imagine, they could share
the finished desserts

00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:54.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
with a big smile
and open heart.

00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:58.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then war would become a thing
of the past and everyone in the

00:05:58.367 --> 00:06:01.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
world would be so
happy and joyful all the time!

âª

00:06:04.934 --> 00:06:06.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
I feel the same way.

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:09.801 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're so wise.

00:06:11.534 --> 00:06:14.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sweets really do
make everyone happy!

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.200 position:7% line:89% align:start
Behind every smile is a sweet!

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:19.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
The road to everlasting
peace is paved with sweets!

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's the only way!

00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:22.968 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.300 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

Almost forgot!

Today's the day
the merchant is finally

-Your goats?

But of course, there are few
things in this world richer

00:06:34.434 --> 00:06:35.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
and more delicious
than cheesecake

made from goat's milk,
mark my words!

Cake from cheese?
I can't wait to try it!

You shall! Go ahead

someone swiped my goats?

[TRAVELING MERCHANT] Well,
actually, to be more precise,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
before I could
bring them here,

00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:59.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
another noble insisted
on purchasing them.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.434 position:10% line:89% align:start
There was nothing I could do.

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:02.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's basically
still swiping them!

[traveling merchant whimpers]

00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:05.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
Forcing someone to sell
something under duress

00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:07.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
is essentially stealing.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
I believe that's what
young Pas is getting at.

00:07:10.767 --> 00:07:12.434 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm so, so sorry!

00:07:12.567 --> 00:07:14.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
I tried to explain
that they already had

a buyer, I really did.

00:07:16.534 --> 00:07:19.234 position:7% line:83% align:start

were dire, and they'd kill me

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:21.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
if I didn't hand
over every last goat!

00:07:21.968 --> 00:07:23.567 position:30% line:83% align:start

Yes, we understand and thank

00:07:28.434 --> 00:07:31.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tell me! Who did you sell
my prized goats to?

00:07:31.734 --> 00:07:34.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
[TRAVELING MERCHANT]
It was Baron Lunzvage.

00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:36.834 position:41% line:83% align:start
I see.
He's infamous for tormenting

00:07:36.968 --> 00:07:38.934 position:21% line:89% align:start
newer noble families.

00:07:39.067 --> 00:07:42.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
If only we had a familial
connection to a powerful noble.

00:07:42.467 --> 00:07:45.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
That would surely help us
with lodging a complaint.

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:47.601 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Pas groans]

00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:50.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sadly, the engagement linking
our family to House Hubarek

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.767 position:16% line:89% align:start
has yet to be formalized.

00:07:51.901 --> 00:07:53.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'd be ill advised
to ask the margrave

00:07:54.067 --> 00:07:55.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
to intervene on our behalf.

00:07:56.634 --> 00:07:59.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
Furthermore, this slight is
undoubtedly a consequence of

00:07:59.734 --> 00:08:03.334 position:7% line:83% align:start
the conflict between the houses
of Hubarek and Lutoroute.

00:08:03.467 --> 00:08:05.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
Complaining about the
shockwaves of a war

00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:06.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
-won't earn us much sympathy.
-Hm.

00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:08.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll just have to
swallow our pride

00:08:08.234 --> 00:08:09.634 position:7% line:89% align:start
and pretend it never happened.

00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:11.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
We received news of the war
but three days ago.

00:08:11.934 --> 00:08:14.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
I can scarcely believe that we
are already suffering

00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:16.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
from the ramifications.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
It must be a rather
large-scale conflict

00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:20.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
and all of our territories
are connected by trade,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
even distant regions will be
affected by it to some degree.

[PAS]
Is this some sort of test?

00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:30.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't care if that maniac
is a baron or a heron.

-Pas?

We can't permit this
tyranny to go unchecked!

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:41.133 position:13% line:83% align:start
Morteln pride demands swift
and immediate retribution

[panting]

-What's wrong, kid?
-Calm down!

00:08:44.567 --> 00:08:46.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
How can I be calm
at a time like this?

00:08:46.434 --> 00:08:48.133 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm going to march right up
to that baron jerk

00:08:48.267 --> 00:08:49.901 position:33% line:83% align:start
and give him
a piece of my mind!

00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:51.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[CASSEROLE] Pas!
-Uh...

00:08:51.601 --> 00:08:53.033 position:33% line:83% align:start
You will calm
yourself at once.

00:08:53.167 --> 00:08:55.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
-But, Father...
-These lands are at war.

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:58.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
Each fief will do what

00:08:58.634 --> 00:09:00.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
especially food
for its people.

00:09:00.701 --> 00:09:03.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
The Lunzvage Barony is closer
to the front lines

00:09:03.434 --> 00:09:05.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
-than our fief is, son.
-Mm...

00:09:05.234 --> 00:09:07.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's only natural that they
would have a more pressing need

00:09:08.067 --> 00:09:09.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
for food than we do.

00:09:09.701 --> 00:09:12.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
Though what the Baron did was
wrong, he did not steal

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.234 position:33% line:83% align:start
those goats,
he paid for them.

00:09:14.367 --> 00:09:15.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
I am sorry that you
lost the chance

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.501 position:13% line:89% align:start
to purchase them yourself.

00:09:17.634 --> 00:09:19.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
But the hard truth is that
you alone were harmed

00:09:20.033 --> 00:09:21.767 position:30% line:83% align:start
by his actions
and you know it.

00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:24.367 position:10% line:83% align:start

-[FEUILLE] Even if you demanded

00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:26.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
the goats back,
he'd just use the war

00:09:26.234 --> 00:09:28.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
as an excuse to send
you on your way.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
There's no chance of success.

00:09:31.567 --> 00:09:34.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE] While I do
understand your frustration,

00:09:34.167 --> 00:09:37.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
all you can do now
is accept reality.

00:09:37.133 --> 00:09:39.234 position:7% line:89% align:start
But I really need those goats!

00:09:39.367 --> 00:09:41.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
Once the conflict is settled,
you'll be able to

00:09:41.734 --> 00:09:43.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
negotiate their return.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
Although it won't be easy.

-Hm...
-Hm. Supplies! That's it!

00:10:08.534 --> 00:10:11.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
If we lend our strength
to the cause as reinforcements

00:10:11.434 --> 00:10:12.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
we'll be able to get priority

-[FEUILLE] Exactly right!

much in the way of aid.

Joining the
reinforcements ourselves

00:10:23.934 --> 00:10:25.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
is a prime opportunity.

00:10:25.367 --> 00:10:27.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
It could give us an
advantage over the baron.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.667 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:31.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
And because Pas and Licorice
are blissfully engaged,

00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:33.868 position:7% line:83% align:start
we have a more-than-sufficient

00:13:06.434 --> 00:13:08.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
We should be able to handle
them without calling

00:13:08.434 --> 00:13:10.634 position:16% line:89% align:start
for more reinforcements.

00:13:10.767 --> 00:13:12.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HUBAREK] Lord Squale.
You heard the man.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.501 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir!

00:13:14.634 --> 00:13:15.901 position:33% line:89% align:start
So if I may.

00:13:16.033 --> 00:13:19.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd like to have you handle
our front-line defense.

00:13:19.434 --> 00:13:21.868 position:35% line:83% align:start
Please, no!
Not without backup!

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
Petra. I know what I am doing
and this is for the best.

00:13:26.133 --> 00:13:28.400 position:41% line:89% align:start
Father.

00:13:31.501 --> 00:13:35.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
My lord! I thank you
for my first campaign.

00:13:35.267 --> 00:13:37.934 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'll go.
And set out at once!

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.200 position:44% line:83% align:start
Good.
Make me proud!

00:13:40.334 --> 00:13:42.400 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Yes, sir.
-Please don't go.

00:13:42.534 --> 00:13:43.868 position:35% line:89% align:start
Never fear.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
I swear that I will protect your
father's lands at all costs.

00:13:50.968 --> 00:13:52.400 position:7% line:89% align:start
[MALE LIEUTENANT] I bring news!

00:13:52.534 --> 00:13:54.133 position:7% line:83% align:start
You'll be pleased to know that
part of the advance unit

00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:56.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
has already arrived near
the border and formed rank!

00:13:56.901 --> 00:13:58.400 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good work.

00:13:58.534 --> 00:14:01.400 position:7% line:83% align:start
M'lord. Our forces have started
to show signs of fatigue.

00:14:01.534 --> 00:14:03.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
Meanwhile, the Hubarek army
has been steadily

00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:05.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
growing their ranks
all this time.

00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:08.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
If we're not careful,
we'll be at a disadvantage.

00:14:08.133 --> 00:14:09.901 position:38% line:83% align:start
[snorts]
Don't tell me you're fool enough

00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:11.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
to believe I would
fail to account

00:14:11.734 --> 00:14:13.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
for any of those factors.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
[LUTOROUTE'S AIDE]
Of course not, m'lord.

00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:17.133 position:7% line:83% align:start
The real goal of this maneuver
is to destroy

00:14:17.267 --> 00:14:19.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hubarek and Kadlecek's alliance.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
How does this affect
the margrave and the duke?

00:14:23.267 --> 00:14:25.033 position:13% line:83% align:start
[LUTOROUTE] At this moment,
Kadlecek's heir

00:14:25.167 --> 00:14:26.567 position:7% line:89% align:start
is stationed at House Hubarek.

00:14:26.701 --> 00:14:29.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
The whelp has never
seen a real battle before.

00:14:29.667 --> 00:14:33.000 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hubarek likely wishes to grant
him his first true campaign,

00:14:33.133 --> 00:14:34.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
but he knows full well
he can't risk

00:14:34.767 --> 00:14:37.100 position:7% line:83% align:start
throwing a dignitary's grandson
into jeopardy.

00:14:37.234 --> 00:14:39.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
However, if he expects
an easy battle,

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.767 position:10% line:83% align:start
it's the perfect opportunity
for that first deployment.

00:14:41.901 --> 00:14:44.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
And if he manages to secure
the boy a win,

00:14:44.334 --> 00:14:46.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
he'll earn Kadlecek's
gratitude in return.

00:14:46.868 --> 00:14:49.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
Too bad I'm going to
lure him out on his own,

00:14:49.534 --> 00:14:52.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
to a place where I can
finish off the brat.

00:14:53.667 --> 00:14:54.801 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:14:54.934 --> 00:14:57.234 position:30% line:83% align:start
That poor girl
will lose her beloved fiancÃ©.

00:14:57.367 --> 00:14:58.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
[LUTOROUTE] Kadlecek will be
furious

00:14:58.834 --> 00:15:00.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
and cut ties with the family.

00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:02.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hubarek will find himself
isolated,

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:04.868 position:7% line:83% align:start
and his attempts to expand his
forces up in smoke.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.200 position:10% line:83% align:start
And while he's still reeling
from his sad change in fortune,

00:15:08.334 --> 00:15:10.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll unleash an all-out
attack and crush him

00:15:10.567 --> 00:15:12.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
before reinforcements arrive.

00:15:12.701 --> 00:15:16.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
Even now, I can practically see
the despair on Hubarek's face.

00:15:16.734 --> 00:15:19.534 position:30% line:83% align:start
What say we go
make it a reality?

00:15:25.534 --> 00:15:27.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SQUALE] I didn't expect
my first deployment

00:15:27.334 --> 00:15:29.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
would arrive so suddenly.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.434 position:13% line:89% align:start
I hope this keeps you safe.

00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:38.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SQUALE] I can't afford to lose.
I must protect Petra!

00:15:46.567 --> 00:15:48.801 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HUBAREK]
Well, if it isn't Lord Morteln

00:15:48.934 --> 00:15:51.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
and Lord Pastry with him!

00:15:51.334 --> 00:15:53.100 position:33% line:83% align:start
We heard that
you were under attack

00:15:53.234 --> 00:15:55.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
and have come to offer
you our aid.

00:15:55.234 --> 00:15:57.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm truly grateful
for your kind offer.

00:15:57.467 --> 00:15:59.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
You traveled so far for us.

00:15:59.234 --> 00:16:00.868 position:13% line:89% align:start
Not you, we came for goats!

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.033 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Quiet!
-Uh!

00:16:03.167 --> 00:16:05.033 position:33% line:83% align:start
-What goats?
-Sorry.

00:16:05.167 --> 00:16:06.400 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just a joke!

00:16:06.534 --> 00:16:08.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
I would do anything
to aid your family

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.834 position:5% line:89% align:start
and protect my precious fiancÃ©e!

00:16:10.968 --> 00:16:12.601 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:16:12.734 --> 00:16:14.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE] How is the battle
going?

00:16:14.501 --> 00:16:17.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
[HUBAREK] Thankfully,
all is well for the moment.

00:16:17.501 --> 00:16:19.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
The enemy force is
smaller than anticipated.

00:16:19.968 --> 00:16:22.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even as we speak, they're
preparing to launch an assault

00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:24.834 position:35% line:83% align:start
from their
front-line fortress.

00:16:24.968 --> 00:16:26.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
-They're few in number?
-Yes.

00:16:27.067 --> 00:16:29.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
I heard reports they could be
thirty-thousand strong.

00:16:29.968 --> 00:16:32.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
In fact, they're closer
to twelve thousand men.

00:16:32.834 --> 00:16:35.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
I would like your
opinion on the matter.

00:16:35.167 --> 00:16:37.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
Where are they stationed?

00:16:37.167 --> 00:16:38.667 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HUBAREK]
There are two thousand here.

00:16:38.801 --> 00:16:41.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
Their main force is here,
with what looks like

00:16:41.267 --> 00:16:43.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
five hundred Provisionals
nearby.

00:16:43.634 --> 00:16:45.300 position:33% line:83% align:start
Furthermore,
we have two hundred men

00:16:45.434 --> 00:16:47.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
protecting this hill.

00:16:47.667 --> 00:16:51.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
There are enemy forces
stationed here as well.

00:16:51.234 --> 00:16:53.367 position:41% line:83% align:start
I see,
their defenses are solid.

00:16:53.501 --> 00:16:55.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[CASSEROLE] It's curious.
-Curious?

00:16:56.067 --> 00:16:57.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
Something is amiss here.

00:16:57.834 --> 00:16:59.000 position:24% line:89% align:start
It doesn't add up.

00:16:59.133 --> 00:17:00.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
It all looks fine at
first glance,

00:17:00.901 --> 00:17:03.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
but when you take a closer look.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
Huh! Your suspicion
confirms my worst fear.

00:17:06.701 --> 00:17:09.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
[PAS] Is this a warrior's
instinct at work?

00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:12.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's little to go on,
but for a veteran like Father,

00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:15.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't think of anything
more trustworthy.

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:17.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
The formation makes sense.

00:17:17.334 --> 00:17:20.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
I would go so far as to
say it's downright solid.

00:17:20.334 --> 00:17:22.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
So why doesn't it feel right?

00:17:23.934 --> 00:17:28.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[PAS] Maybe it's too solid?
-Hmm? What do you mean?

00:17:28.133 --> 00:17:29.901 position:30% line:83% align:start
It shouldn't be
this solid now.

00:17:30.033 --> 00:17:32.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is the formation of
an army preparing to defend

00:17:32.667 --> 00:17:34.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
against an assault,
not launch their own.

00:17:35.067 --> 00:17:36.200 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:36.334 --> 00:17:38.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
[PAS] But they're the ones
invading.

00:17:38.501 --> 00:17:40.334 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why are they in
a defensive formation

00:17:40.467 --> 00:17:42.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
when they should be
on the attack?

00:17:42.567 --> 00:17:45.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
True. Why would invaders
up their defenses?

00:17:45.667 --> 00:17:47.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
It doesn't make sense,
especially before

00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:49.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
a single battle is fought.

00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:50.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
[HUBAREK] So that explains

00:17:50.601 --> 00:17:52.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
this sense of dread
I've been feeling.

00:17:52.267 --> 00:17:54.701 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't get it.
What game are they playing?

00:17:54.834 --> 00:17:57.400 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HUBAREK] Perhaps their goal is
to wear us down over time?

00:17:57.534 --> 00:18:00.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
If I were them...
Watch.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'd leave the majority of my
forces to solidify our defenses

00:18:04.367 --> 00:18:06.434 position:35% line:83% align:start
and make up
for my lacking numbers,

00:18:06.567 --> 00:18:11.033 position:7% line:83% align:start
by forcing a contained war zone
utilizing small mobile units.

00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:12.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
Allowing me to slowly
but surely

00:18:13.067 --> 00:18:14.267 position:35% line:83% align:start
shave down
my opponent's numbers

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
through repeated ambushes.

00:18:16.701 --> 00:18:17.901 position:24% line:89% align:start
Here, for example.

00:18:18.033 --> 00:18:21.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
This location is exactly
where I would strike first.

00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:23.200 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Hubarek gasps]

00:18:23.334 --> 00:18:25.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
[PAS]If you put yourself
in your opponent's position

00:18:25.334 --> 00:18:27.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
you can figure out
exactly what they're after?

00:18:27.868 --> 00:18:29.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE] If I can assume
that you'll be defending

00:18:29.868 --> 00:18:31.300 position:7% line:89% align:start
against attacks from the North

00:18:31.434 --> 00:18:33.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
then a strike here
would leave me mostly unscathed

00:18:33.734 --> 00:18:36.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
and the terrain makes it
the perfect spot for an ambush.

00:18:37.167 --> 00:18:38.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Hubarek groans]

00:18:38.801 --> 00:18:42.000 position:30% line:83% align:start
-What's wrong?
-[HUBAREK] I messed up.

00:18:42.501 --> 00:18:46.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
That location is right where
Lord Squale's unit is headed!

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.934 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[both gasps]
-Lord Squale's in danger?

00:18:49.334 --> 00:18:50.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mistakenly thought
it would be

00:18:50.901 --> 00:18:52.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
an easy area to defend.

00:18:52.734 --> 00:18:53.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's why it seemed like

00:18:53.968 --> 00:18:55.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
a fitting first deployment
for him.
