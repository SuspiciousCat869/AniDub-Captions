00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:27.562 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[AGNES] So, we prevailed?
-[VILLAGER 1] We did!

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.597 position:27% line:83% align:start
Dozens of bandits
are now in custody.

00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:32.132 position:19% line:83% align:start
And what of my husband
and little Pas?

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.835 position:33% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER 1]
His Lordship is safe, milady.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:38.171 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Lord Pas has an arm injury.
-An injury? Oh, dear.

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:39.641 position:10% line:83% align:start
How could I let this happen?
[emotional]

00:00:39.774 --> 00:00:42.677 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sure it's not serious!
Is it?

00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:45.580 position:7% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER 1] Oh, of course not!
Nothing to fret over.

00:00:45.713 --> 00:00:47.047 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Agnes relief]

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:49.182 position:16% line:89% align:start
Father and Pas must know

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:50.852 position:30% line:83% align:start
that we're sick
with worry waiting for them.

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:55.122 position:13% line:83% align:start
What's taking them so long?
Why haven't they come home yet?

00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
The rightmost stack
is for the main village.

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:01.029 position:16% line:89% align:start
Please split up the rest

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.764 position:27% line:83% align:start
and take it back
to your own villages.

00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:04.431 position:35% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGERS]
Yes, my lord!

00:01:09.938 --> 00:01:12.439 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NARRATOR] This is the tale
of a genius patisserie

00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:14.842 position:21% line:83% align:start
whose dream of making
the world's greatest dessert

00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:16.176 position:30% line:89% align:start
was cut short.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.812 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, reincarnated
into another realm

00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:19.379 position:13% line:89% align:start
as the son of a poor noble,

00:01:19.514 --> 00:01:22.684 position:24% line:83% align:start
he pursues a world
full of desserts and smiles!

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.386 position:13% line:83% align:start
A tale that's syrupy sweet,
chock full of yummy treats

00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:29.222 position:33% line:83% align:start
and sprinkled
with bitter darkness.

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:31.593 position:7% line:89% align:start
A pastry chef, who was reborn,

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:37.230 position:5% line:83% align:start
and dreams of creating this new
world's very own land of sweets!

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.861 position:10% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE] Make certain that
they're each tied up separately!

00:03:13.995 --> 00:03:16.564 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[COINTREAU] Yes, my lord!
-[GLACAGE] Yes, my lord!

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's the plan, Boss?

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:22.904 position:7% line:83% align:start
Are we still shipping them off
to the County of Retes?

00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:26.607 position:13% line:83% align:start
That is what must be done.
Let them claim the victory

00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:29.143 position:16% line:83% align:start
though they merely drove
the bandits our way.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.679 position:30% line:83% align:start
This will allow
the Count to save face.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.315 position:24% line:83% align:start
He'll owe us a huge
thank you for a ruse like that.

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.719 position:30% line:83% align:start
We'll work out
those fine details,

00:03:37.852 --> 00:03:41.155 position:10% line:83% align:start
but at the very least we need
to recoup our campaign expenses

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:44.058 position:13% line:83% align:start
and our losses from sealing
the other two villages

00:03:44.192 --> 00:03:45.793 position:13% line:89% align:start
and that's just the start.

00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:48.563 position:33% line:89% align:start
Next Glacage!

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:50.765 position:38% line:89% align:start
My lord!

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:52.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
For your courageous
frontline defense efforts

00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:55.302 position:21% line:83% align:start
I award you a spear
and one silver coin!

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:57.939 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[Villagers cheering]
-Thank you, my lord!

00:03:58.206 --> 00:04:00.608 position:7% line:89% align:start
Next up. Marcarullo, Luminito!

00:04:00.742 --> 00:04:02.677 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[LUMI] We're here!
-[MARC] We're here!

00:04:03.177 --> 00:04:05.479 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wonder why he didn't call us
one at a time.

00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:06.781 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, that's a good question!

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:08.516 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE]
You're quite the pair.

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:10.952 position:21% line:83% align:start
For serving Pas well
and assisting him in battle

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:14.321 position:13% line:83% align:start
I award each of you a sword
and a bag of barley!

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:15.623 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[Lumi awe]
-No way!

00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:18.926 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[Marc smile]
-Wow, thank you!

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.562 position:35% line:89% align:start
[applause]

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:23.497 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARC]
Kinda embarrassing

00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:25.166 position:10% line:83% align:start
getting this much attention,
huh?

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:29.570 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, no kidding and this barley
sure is heavy, too.

00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:33.241 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Wait up, I'll help!
-Hey, Pas! Oh, thanks a lot!

00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:36.544 position:7% line:83% align:start
-You both did great back there!
-[Marc laugh]

00:04:36.677 --> 00:04:38.411 position:10% line:89% align:start
Not so great compared to you.

00:04:38.646 --> 00:04:40.248 position:33% line:83% align:start
But at least
we held our own, right?

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.350 position:19% line:83% align:start
I threw way more stones
than you, so speak for yourself!

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:45.753 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh? I'm the one who hit
that bandit in the head--

00:04:45.887 --> 00:04:47.822 position:5% line:83% align:start
[PAS] Thank goodness we all made
it through the battle.

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:49.791 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now we can get
back to normal life.

00:04:49.924 --> 00:04:51.893 position:24% line:83% align:start
He'll be just fine
with us around.

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:54.262 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just keep us by your side,
and you're golden!

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:56.864 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sounds like a plan.

00:04:56.998 --> 00:04:58.599 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARC]
Mom, look what I got!

00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:01.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
His Lordship granted me
a sword for my service!

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.303 position:13% line:89% align:start
And a whole bag of barley!

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:05.873 position:13% line:83% align:start
-You're the best, Big Bro!
-The best!

00:05:06.007 --> 00:05:08.042 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're home safe.
That is all I wished for

00:05:08.176 --> 00:05:10.343 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the greatest reward
I could have received.

00:05:12.113 --> 00:05:15.149 position:7% line:83% align:start
Tell me my lord, my foolish son
didn't cause you any trouble

00:05:15.283 --> 00:05:16.884 position:16% line:89% align:start
on your mission, did he?

00:05:17.118 --> 00:05:20.453 position:16% line:83% align:start
Not at all. He was great.
They both were.

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:23.490 position:21% line:83% align:start
One thing is certain.
Those two are indispensable

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:25.726 position:33% line:83% align:start
to my future
and that of Morteln!

00:05:26.027 --> 00:05:27.762 position:21% line:83% align:start
[LUMI'S GRANDFATHER]
You made us proud, Lumi!

00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:30.064 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's my granddaughter!
[chuckle and pleased]

00:05:30.198 --> 00:05:32.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're squeezing too tight!

00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:35.069 position:7% line:83% align:start
Never imagined you'd be aiding
our lord and his son

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:36.537 position:21% line:83% align:start
-at such a young age!
-Grandpa, my back!

00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:38.139 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're going to break me
in half!

00:05:38.272 --> 00:05:40.440 position:10% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER 2] Sir! We brought
the wine you requested!

00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:42.276 position:21% line:83% align:start
[LUMI'S GRANDFATHER]
Huzzah! Come on in!

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.377 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's time to celebrate!

00:05:45.613 --> 00:05:46.848 position:13% line:89% align:start
Your father isn't back yet?

00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:49.650 position:38% line:83% align:start
Not yet.
He's in talks with Marc's dad.

00:05:49.784 --> 00:05:52.053 position:7% line:83% align:start
Said he still had some business
to wrap up.

00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:53.721 position:19% line:89% align:start
A shame we missed him!

00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:56.991 position:7% line:83% align:start
But, hey, I see the young lord
is here with us!

00:05:57.124 --> 00:05:58.793 position:33% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER 3]
You're here at the perfect time!

00:05:58.926 --> 00:06:00.862 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Come and join our celebration!
-Thanks!

00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:03.331 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Count me in!
-Wine time, right?

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:04.799 position:33% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER 4]
Don't be stupid,

00:06:04.932 --> 00:06:06.499 position:30% line:83% align:start
it's fresh milk
for you and the young lord!

00:06:06.634 --> 00:06:08.736 position:38% line:83% align:start
-No fair.
-[Pas smile]

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.371 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[ALL] Cheers!
-[laugh]

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.976 position:10% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER 5] I can't believe
Lumi and Marc got rewarded!

00:06:15.109 --> 00:06:17.111 position:19% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER 6] Honestly,
I thought those rapscallions

00:06:17.245 --> 00:06:18.746 position:16% line:89% align:start
were nothing but trouble!

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.281 position:16% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER 7] An ambush by
the children led by our young--

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:21.983 position:21% line:83% align:start
[LUMI'S GRANDFATHER]
Now I can walk down the road

00:06:22.116 --> 00:06:23.450 position:16% line:83% align:start
-with my head held high!
-[VILLAGER 8] Magnificent!

[Pas smile]

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:27.221 position:19% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER 9] Long live
our next suzerain lord!

00:06:27.355 --> 00:06:28.623 position:44% line:83% align:start
[PAS]
With all that over

00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:30.691 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can finally focus
on making desserts!

00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:34.862 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sweet victory! I'm going to make
a nice bonka pie!

00:06:34.996 --> 00:06:39.800 position:27% line:83% align:start
What will I need?
Butter. Flour. Eggs.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.272 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hm, I've got to find something
reminiscent of cinnamon.

00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:48.876 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MARC] Sheesh! I'm so used to
everyone always yelling at us.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.478 position:21% line:83% align:start
It feels sorta weird
being praised like that.

00:06:51.612 --> 00:06:53.915 position:16% line:83% align:start
You mean you're used to
everyone yelling at you.

00:06:54.048 --> 00:06:56.751 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, please!
You get yelled at plenty!

00:06:57.084 --> 00:07:00.655 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, what do you think
they did with the bandits?

00:07:00.788 --> 00:07:03.624 position:13% line:83% align:start
[LUMI] I hear they put 'em
in the shed in the main village.

00:07:03.758 --> 00:07:06.928 position:7% line:83% align:start
Let's go look at the prisoners!
It's our duty.

00:07:07.061 --> 00:07:09.330 position:24% line:83% align:start
As future retainers
of the lord of this land,

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:11.532 position:16% line:83% align:start
we've got to stay on top
of this stuff!

00:07:11.666 --> 00:07:13.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're right!

00:07:17.038 --> 00:07:18.406 position:33% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER 10]
It's too dangerous

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:19.674 position:27% line:83% align:start
to allow children
like you inside!

00:07:19.807 --> 00:07:21.409 position:7% line:89% align:start
C'mon! We'll just be a second!

00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:23.077 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're not worth
losing my neck over!

-Now scram!
-Come on! You jerk.

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:30.751 position:13% line:83% align:start
After all we did, they're
treating us like children!

-Quiet.
