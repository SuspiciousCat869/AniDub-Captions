whose dream of making
the world's greatest dessert

Now reincarnated

as the son of a poor noble,

he pursues a world
full of desserts and smiles!

In the great hall,

00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:28.743 position:24% line:83% align:start
you were the topic
of every single conversation

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:29.844 position:27% line:89% align:start
I could make out.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:33.081 position:10% line:83% align:start
Some of the ladies here seem
quite taken with you,

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.750 position:16% line:83% align:start
then when I heard the way
they spoke about you...

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:37.118 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hm.

00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:38.820 position:10% line:83% align:start
[LICORICE] ...I couldn't help
but to imagine

00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:40.722 position:19% line:89% align:start
the most awful things.

00:03:40.855 --> 00:03:42.090 position:24% line:89% align:start
What awful things?

00:03:42.657 --> 00:03:44.458 position:35% line:83% align:start
[LICORICE]
I thought perhaps,

00:03:44.592 --> 00:03:46.293 position:10% line:89% align:start
if some other lady were to...

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:48.428 position:7% line:89% align:start
profess her fondness for you...

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:51.699 position:27% line:89% align:start
that you might...

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:52.667 position:30% line:89% align:start
Maybe you'd...

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.202 position:38% line:89% align:start
[crying]

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:57.038 position:10% line:83% align:start
You'd become fond of her too,
and decide you didn't want me.

00:03:57.171 --> 00:03:58.773 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, I would never!

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.174 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:02.476 position:35% line:83% align:start
[LICORICE]
My sister, Petra.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.946 position:24% line:89% align:start
She isn't like me.

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.883 position:7% line:83% align:start
She's so cheerful and charming,
and can talk to anyone.

00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:10.317 position:19% line:89% align:start
She's bold and bright,

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.754 position:33% line:83% align:start
and instantly
wins everybody over

00:04:12.887 --> 00:04:15.355 position:16% line:83% align:start
while I just shrink away
from them all.

00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:19.961 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why can't I be more like her?

[gasps]

00:04:22.563 --> 00:04:24.464 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know talking can be hard
for you.

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.299 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't mind
that you're reserved.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.703 position:30% line:83% align:start
You don't need
to be more like Lady Petra.

Mm...

00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:31.873 position:7% line:89% align:start
The differences between you two

00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:34.341 position:13% line:83% align:start
are part of what makes you
the person you are.

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:38.913 position:30% line:83% align:start
And, Licorice,
I like the person you are.

And as time goes on,

00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:45.520 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sure that I'll like
the person you become too.

00:04:47.088 --> 00:04:51.092 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean it, so please,
will you trust me?

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.027 position:7% line:89% align:start
Do you believe what I'm saying?

00:04:54.862 --> 00:04:55.763 position:44% line:89% align:start
I do.

Huh?

You can wait here.
I won't be long.

Trust me no matter what.

Mm-hm.

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:11.879 position:21% line:89% align:start

Yes.

00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:02.997 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mostly, but different
in a few important ways.

Huh?

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.267 position:7% line:83% align:start
[PAS] I made this one special,
just for you.

the thought of you enjoying this

Ah...

00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:29.123 position:5% line:83% align:start

they're filling my mouth.

This is a flavor that
only Pastry and I have shared...

a taste of the happiness

A flavor that nobody knows.

Maybe this will sound strange,

00:07:23.044 --> 00:07:25.613 position:16% line:83% align:start

about these sugar-coated bonkas,

we called them "candied apples."

Yes, several.

00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:37.591 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a very simple treat

Wherever you go,

you'll find
a different candy apple

00:07:43.898 --> 00:07:45.166 position:19% line:89% align:start
under a different name.

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:49.637 position:24% line:83% align:start
Like "toffee apple"
or sometimes "heaven's apple".

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:53.174 position:5% line:83% align:start
But my favorite name of them all
is this...

"The apple of love."
