We heard you were sent here,

I'm so glad you're safe.

00:02:53.508 --> 00:02:54.909 position:10% line:89% align:start
I was beside myself worrying

00:02:55.043 --> 00:02:56.678 position:30% line:83% align:start
something might
have happened to you.

00:02:56.811 --> 00:02:59.681 position:19% line:83% align:start
We did repel the enemy,
but that came with a cost.

00:02:59.814 --> 00:03:01.415 position:7% line:89% align:start
Many men have lost their lives.

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.619 position:16% line:83% align:start
My lack of due diligence
put you in grave danger.

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:06.554 position:21% line:89% align:start
It isn't your fault.

00:03:06.988 --> 00:03:09.289 position:24% line:83% align:start
And as for you two,
I'm in your debt.

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:11.025 position:19% line:89% align:start
You have my gratitude.

[CASSEROLE] Even when
surrounded by enemies.

00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:18.398 position:21% line:89% align:start
He refused to yield.

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:20.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
He was determined
to fight his way out.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.173 position:21% line:83% align:start
And yet I do not know
what would have happened to me

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.642 position:38% line:83% align:start
out there
if you two hadn't come.

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.111 position:16% line:89% align:start
According to the reports,

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:33.014 position:21% line:83% align:start
Lutoroute seems to be
withdrawing his troops for now.

Excellent news
to hear, Your Grace.

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:36.651 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's time to celebrate the men

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:38.586 position:21% line:83% align:start
who helped to lead us
to our victory.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.788 position:19% line:83% align:start
You first and foremost,
Lord Squale,

00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:43.191 position:24% line:83% align:start
for your steadfast
devotion in battle.

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:45.292 position:21% line:89% align:start
You were quite brave.

00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:47.427 position:33% line:89% align:start
Was I really?

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.164 position:19% line:89% align:start
You seem rather tired.

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:51.498 position:27% line:89% align:start
That makes sense.

00:03:51.632 --> 00:03:53.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
Perhaps you should rest
for a while.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.937 position:16% line:89% align:start
I think I might do that.

00:03:58.573 --> 00:04:00.041 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm so glad you're back.

00:04:00.174 --> 00:04:03.276 position:30% line:83% align:start
I was worried,
you weren't hurt, were you?

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.246 position:13% line:89% align:start
I appreciate your concern,

00:04:06.714 --> 00:04:09.550 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I suffered no more
than scratches, I assure you.

00:04:09.684 --> 00:04:12.887 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm so relieved to hear that.
I missed you.

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.390 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:20.128 position:13% line:89% align:start
What's wrong, Lord Squale?

00:04:20.595 --> 00:04:23.296 position:41% line:83% align:start
[sighs]
I'm exhausted right now.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:24.932 position:24% line:89% align:start
We can talk later.

00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:26.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll show you to your room.

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:28.936 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, but please,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.438 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just need some time
to myself to think.

00:04:31.572 --> 00:04:33.608 position:13% line:89% align:start
Please, wait, Lord Squale.

00:04:35.109 --> 00:04:36.577 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm worried about him.

00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:37.912 position:33% line:89% align:start
He's unwell.

00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:40.148 position:21% line:83% align:start
His first deployment
really took its toll.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.016 position:33% line:83% align:start
People often
find themselves crushed.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.852 position:13% line:83% align:start

trauma is too much to bear.

00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:46.486 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HUBAREK]
I must agree with you.

00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:49.190 position:16% line:83% align:start
It does seem to have been
rather difficult for him.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:50.423 position:24% line:89% align:start
[CASSEROLE] Indeed.

00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:51.893 position:27% line:83% align:start
but for the heir
to the ducal house

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:54.461 position:33% line:83% align:start
that oversees
the royal capital's military,

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:57.265 position:27% line:83% align:start
it's a necessary
life experience.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.733 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HUBAREK]
Indeed.

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:05.006 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes, but, he had such a
haunted expression on his face.

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.974 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've never seen him like that.

00:05:09.644 --> 00:05:10.845 position:41% line:83% align:start
[PETRA]
I feel helpless.

00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:13.581 position:21% line:83% align:start
What can I do to ease
his suffering?

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:16.751 position:24% line:89% align:start
Though he needs me,

00:05:16.884 --> 00:05:18.351 position:7% line:83% align:start
I don't know what will make him
feel better

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.955 position:21% line:83% align:start
or how to comfort him
after all of this.

defeated those bandits.

00:05:27.728 --> 00:05:29.831 position:21% line:83% align:start
but then you found a
way to cheer him up.

00:05:29.964 --> 00:05:30.998 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:31.632 --> 00:05:34.735 position:24% line:83% align:start

when I made the bonka pie.

about the same age, as well.

Oh, uh, I could try.

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:43.443 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, thank you.

00:05:43.578 --> 00:05:45.046 position:27% line:89% align:start

I don't mind,

00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:50.318 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I can't help feeling like
if his fiancee

can't console him,
I have no chance.

I believe you do.

When you heat the bonkas

00:11:55.416 --> 00:11:56.951 position:30% line:83% align:start
it gives depth
to their tartness

[SQUALE] Why is it
called "tarte Tatin?"

00:12:16.504 --> 00:12:17.871 position:30% line:83% align:start
[PAS] The name
actually comes from

00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:19.574 position:13% line:89% align:start
the two master tart-makers,

00:12:19.708 --> 00:12:20.841 position:24% line:89% align:start
the Tatin sisters.

00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:22.443 position:16% line:89% align:start
I've never heard of them.

00:12:23.177 --> 00:12:25.946 position:16% line:83% align:start
Typically with tarts, you
lay the fresh fruit directly

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.215 position:19% line:83% align:start
on top of the raw dough
and then bake it.

00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:29.984 position:33% line:89% align:start
But one day,

00:12:30.117 --> 00:12:32.052 position:16% line:83% align:start
one of the sisters forgot
to put the crust into the mold.

00:12:32.186 --> 00:12:34.689 position:16% line:83% align:start
So they ended up roasting
the fruit in the oven alone.

00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:36.156 position:21% line:89% align:start
With no other choice,

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.891 position:13% line:89% align:start
The sisters laid the dough

00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:39.994 position:7% line:83% align:start
on top of the half baked fruit
and let it finish.

00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:43.632 position:16% line:83% align:start
Doing so resulted in what
we now call a tarte Tatin.

00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:45.366 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's where it comes from?

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:47.935 position:21% line:83% align:start
In other words, a lot
of people at the time,

00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:49.870 position:24% line:83% align:start
would have probably
said that tarte Tatin

00:12:50.004 --> 00:12:51.772 position:16% line:89% align:start
was a failure of a tart.

00:12:54.275 --> 00:12:55.976 position:35% line:89% align:start
A failure?

00:12:58.647 --> 00:12:59.581 position:33% line:89% align:start
[PAS] But...

00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:01.215 position:27% line:83% align:start
I happen to think
this dessert can

00:13:01.348 --> 00:13:03.551 position:24% line:83% align:start
teach us something
incredibly important.

00:13:04.686 --> 00:13:06.120 position:33% line:89% align:start
And that is?

00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:08.222 position:13% line:83% align:start
If the Tatin sisters hadn't
been adaptable that day,

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:10.157 position:10% line:89% align:start
when faced with their error,

00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:12.092 position:13% line:83% align:start
they could've easily thrown
out the fruit and started over,

00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:14.995 position:13% line:83% align:start
then this tart might never
have been created, huh?

00:13:16.531 --> 00:13:19.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was a treat that most
bakers would've just discarded.

00:13:19.701 --> 00:13:20.834 position:33% line:89% align:start
But instead,

00:13:21.035 --> 00:13:22.803 position:27% line:83% align:start
because the Tatin
sisters didn't give up

00:13:22.936 --> 00:13:24.938 position:16% line:83% align:start
and refused to let their
failure go to waste,

00:13:25.072 --> 00:13:27.408 position:27% line:83% align:start
we can enjoy its
deliciousness even now.

00:13:27.642 --> 00:13:31.078 position:24% line:83% align:start
They refused to let
their failure go to waste?

00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:33.080 position:24% line:83% align:start
Whenever I mess up
a sweet I'm making,

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:35.115 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think back to the
tarte Tatin and remember

00:13:35.249 --> 00:13:37.117 position:30% line:83% align:start
the origins of
this masterpiece.

00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:39.621 position:24% line:83% align:start
So failure doesn't
have to be a waste at all.

00:13:39.853 --> 00:13:42.289 position:16% line:83% align:start
The most important thing
is to keep looking forward

00:13:42.423 --> 00:13:45.059 position:19% line:83% align:start
and working hard, even
in the face of defeat.

00:14:13.788 --> 00:14:15.456 position:13% line:89% align:start
you'll return to me safely!

00:14:16.791 --> 00:14:19.694 position:19% line:83% align:start
You made it home alive,
and you kept your promise

00:14:19.828 --> 00:14:20.961 position:21% line:89% align:start
to your future wife.

00:14:21.095 --> 00:14:21.995 position:35% line:89% align:start
But still,

00:14:22.797 --> 00:14:25.999 position:16% line:83% align:start
the only reason I made it
out of danger was because

00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:27.702 position:21% line:89% align:start
of other sacrifices.

00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:31.338 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just feel so awful
for all of them.

00:14:31.573 --> 00:14:32.574 position:27% line:89% align:start
You have a heart.

00:14:32.707 --> 00:14:34.274 position:19% line:83% align:start
Isn't that how a leader
should feel

00:14:34.408 --> 00:14:36.644 position:13% line:83% align:start
after watching his soldiers
go down in battle?

00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:40.481 position:13% line:83% align:start
Instead of celebrating the
victory of your first campaign,

00:14:40.615 --> 00:14:42.116 position:41% line:83% align:start
you're
thinking about all of the men

00:14:42.249 --> 00:14:44.118 position:13% line:83% align:start
who sacrificed their lives
for you.

00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:47.789 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm very proud of you
for the modesty you've shown.

00:14:48.088 --> 00:14:49.624 position:19% line:89% align:start
And you should be, too.

00:14:51.158 --> 00:14:52.459 position:35% line:89% align:start
Lady Petra.

00:14:53.762 --> 00:14:57.364 position:13% line:83% align:start
All I truly wanted was your
safe return, Lord Squale.

00:14:57.498 --> 00:15:00.033 position:10% line:83% align:start
Nothing could make me happier
than that.

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:02.136 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

00:15:09.778 --> 00:15:11.979 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thank you, so much.

00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:17.251 position:7% line:89% align:start
Lord Pastry. I am in your debt.

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:20.921 position:19% line:83% align:start
Someday, I swear I will
become a stronger man.

00:15:21.556 --> 00:15:23.658 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SQUALE] I won't let
this failure be in vain.

00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:25.959 position:27% line:89% align:start
I believe in you

00:15:28.162 --> 00:15:29.531 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SQUALE] Pardon me,
would anyone mind

00:15:29.664 --> 00:15:31.866 position:27% line:83% align:start
if I had another
piece of tarte Tatin?

00:15:32.032 --> 00:15:33.434 position:44% line:83% align:start
[PAS]
Of course not.

00:15:33.601 --> 00:15:35.737 position:21% line:83% align:start
Lady Petra, would you
like to go find a sunny spot

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.372 position:33% line:83% align:start
in the garden
and enjoy this treat together?

00:15:38.573 --> 00:15:39.607 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sounds great.

00:15:41.843 --> 00:15:44.244 position:13% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE] He seems to be
in better spirits.

00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:45.814 position:44% line:83% align:start
[PAS]
Yes.

00:15:46.447 --> 00:15:48.616 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sadly, the heartbreak
of your first campaign

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.852 position:21% line:83% align:start
is something you have
to overcome on your own.

00:15:50.984 --> 00:15:52.419 position:27% line:83% align:start
I could remember
how hard it was

00:15:52.554 --> 00:15:54.556 position:19% line:83% align:start
for me going through it
as a young man.

00:15:54.789 --> 00:15:55.924 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, that's right.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.357 position:24% line:89% align:start
I also experienced

00:15:57.491 --> 00:15:59.359 position:16% line:83% align:start
similar struggles myself
when I was young.

00:15:59.493 --> 00:16:00.528 position:38% line:89% align:start
Did you?!

00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:02.963 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well in any case, Lord Pastry,

00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:05.299 position:27% line:83% align:start
I must find a way
to offer my thanks.

00:16:05.499 --> 00:16:06.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
If there's anything
in particular

00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:08.736 position:13% line:89% align:start
you'd like, simply name it.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.605 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh? Wait, for real?

00:16:11.138 --> 00:16:13.140 position:7% line:83% align:start
[PAS] There are so many things
on my list.

00:16:13.273 --> 00:16:14.676 position:30% line:89% align:start
I want it all.

00:16:14.809 --> 00:16:17.377 position:16% line:83% align:start
But what do I really need
to make my land of sweets?

00:16:17.512 --> 00:16:18.445 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:16:19.246 --> 00:16:20.147 position:30% line:89% align:start
Your Lordship,

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.049 position:13% line:89% align:start
there is something I want.

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:31.358 position:35% line:83% align:start
[LICORICE]
Welcome home, Pastry!

00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:33.695 position:44% line:83% align:start
[PAS]
It feels good to be back.

00:16:34.094 --> 00:16:35.864 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just look at all that stuff.

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:37.064 position:19% line:89% align:start
Are they merchants now?

00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:38.900 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're expressions
of gratitude

00:16:39.032 --> 00:16:40.400 position:19% line:89% align:start
sent from Lord Hubarek.

00:16:40.869 --> 00:16:42.302 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm so glad you're safe.

00:16:42.804 --> 00:16:45.372 position:27% line:83% align:start
Also, your father
gave me a letter for you.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.007 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, thank you.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.610 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can't wait to read it.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.680 position:19% line:83% align:start
"Work the negotiations
to our advantage?"

00:16:53.046 --> 00:16:54.047 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let's see.

00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:55.315 position:27% line:83% align:start
That must be why
the boss decided

00:16:55.449 --> 00:16:57.084 position:27% line:83% align:start
to stay behind in
the margravate?

00:16:57.251 --> 00:16:58.151 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:16:58.786 --> 00:17:00.555 position:35% line:83% align:start
You can be
certain of one thing.

00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:02.422 position:30% line:83% align:start
Baron Lunzvage
will pay for shoving

00:17:02.557 --> 00:17:04.258 position:30% line:83% align:start
his greedy hand
into my wallet!

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:07.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
So as you can imagine,
he seemed pretty worked up.

00:17:07.595 --> 00:17:10.732 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sounds like another example
of, like, father like son.

00:17:10.865 --> 00:17:12.232 position:16% line:89% align:start
Besides, this all started

00:17:12.366 --> 00:17:13.902 position:30% line:83% align:start
because he used
"procurement in a time of war"

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:16.370 position:16% line:83% align:start
to buy all the goats that
were supposed to come to us.

00:17:16.504 --> 00:17:18.138 position:33% line:83% align:start
And he seemed
quite enthusiastic

00:17:18.272 --> 00:17:19.239 position:24% line:89% align:start
about doing it too.

00:17:19.841 --> 00:17:21.676 position:27% line:83% align:start
[PAS] I'm sure he
won't complain too much

00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:23.845 position:7% line:83% align:start
if we buy up all the provisions
and livestock

00:17:23.978 --> 00:17:25.647 position:10% line:89% align:start
he was going to get in turn.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.915 position:33% line:89% align:start
Buy them up?

00:17:27.347 --> 00:17:29.216 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why after all,
Morteln contributed

00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:31.553 position:30% line:83% align:start
the most to the
campaign, did we not?

00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:34.388 position:19% line:83% align:start
Since we're doing this
anyway, rendering him docile

00:17:34.522 --> 00:17:35.757 position:7% line:89% align:start
by inflicting a two-fold return

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.292 position:24% line:83% align:start
should make future
negotiations easier.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.994 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ha, ha, ha.

00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:42.362 position:27% line:83% align:start
That look on your
face is so creepy.

00:17:42.496 --> 00:17:44.732 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, of course
it's up to father--

00:17:44.866 --> 00:17:46.500 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE]
Negotiations are complete.

00:17:47.001 --> 00:17:48.670 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Father.
-So soon?

00:17:48.803 --> 00:17:49.704 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:17:49.837 --> 00:17:50.939 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're heading right back.

00:17:51.204 --> 00:17:52.907 position:13% line:89% align:start
Huh? Why? What's the rush?

00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:56.076 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's going to take forever
with my teleportation alone,

00:17:56.343 --> 00:17:58.245 position:30% line:83% align:start
it'll be faster
if you replicate my magic

00:17:58.378 --> 00:17:59.614 position:21% line:89% align:start
and help me carry it.

00:18:00.113 --> 00:18:02.016 position:13% line:89% align:start
Really? There's that much?

00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:04.351 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just what did you
negotiate for?

[gasps]

00:18:12.794 --> 00:18:15.797 position:44% line:83% align:start
How?
What the heck is all this?

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.497 position:7% line:89% align:start
Come on now! This is obviously

00:18:17.632 --> 00:18:20.034 position:30% line:83% align:start
going too far!
Even for you, boss!

00:18:20.167 --> 00:18:21.736 position:19% line:89% align:start
Look at these beauties.

00:18:21.903 --> 00:18:24.973 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now, you don't see horses this
exquisite very often, Feuille.

00:18:25.172 --> 00:18:26.574 position:30% line:83% align:start
They were going
through the final checks

00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:28.308 position:24% line:83% align:start
when I insisted on
buying them before

00:18:28.442 --> 00:18:30.011 position:27% line:83% align:start
they were sent to
Baron Lunzvage.

00:18:30.243 --> 00:18:31.679 position:21% line:89% align:start
Eye for an eye, huh?

00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:33.447 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE]
Apparently, the baron paid

00:18:33.581 --> 00:18:34.782 position:16% line:89% align:start
enormous amounts of money

00:18:34.916 --> 00:18:36.450 position:24% line:83% align:start
to raise them under
his supervision

00:18:36.584 --> 00:18:38.086 position:30% line:83% align:start
from when they
were just foals.

00:18:38.318 --> 00:18:39.854 position:24% line:83% align:start
To have such a low
ranked noble

00:18:39.988 --> 00:18:41.689 position:30% line:83% align:start
swipe them out
from under his nose...

00:18:41.856 --> 00:18:43.758 position:33% line:83% align:start
He's probably
writhing in frustration

00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:45.225 position:16% line:89% align:start
and pain right about now.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.227 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know that weird
face you're making

00:18:47.361 --> 00:18:49.697 position:27% line:83% align:start
is even creepier
looking than your kid's!

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.268 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hm. So is this one of those
wine things or what?

00:18:55.603 --> 00:18:57.404 position:10% line:89% align:start
It looks like a juicer to me.

00:18:57.572 --> 00:19:00.173 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, basically,
the more you crank this handle

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.309 position:16% line:83% align:start
the more the fruit inside
gets crushed,

00:19:02.442 --> 00:19:04.211 position:27% line:83% align:start
which then forces
the juice out.

00:19:04.378 --> 00:19:05.412 position:33% line:89% align:start
[exclaiming]

00:19:05.546 --> 00:19:07.280 position:38% line:83% align:start
Let's try
and give it a whirl.

00:19:21.095 --> 00:19:22.730 position:24% line:89% align:start
Mother, you called?

00:19:23.031 --> 00:19:24.297 position:13% line:89% align:start
Something important came up

00:19:24.431 --> 00:19:26.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I need you to go
to the royal capital

00:19:26.233 --> 00:19:27.902 position:24% line:83% align:start
-with your father.
-What for?

00:19:28.036 --> 00:19:31.539 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, Pas, you see it's
concerning my father's letter.

00:19:31.706 --> 00:19:33.407 position:24% line:83% align:start
He wanted to invite
Petra and me to the

00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:35.576 position:21% line:83% align:start
royal capital at the
end of summer, but...

00:19:35.977 --> 00:19:38.012 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't know what I
should wear when I go,

00:19:38.146 --> 00:19:39.947 position:38% line:83% align:start
I wanted
to get everyone's opinion.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.050 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, we gathered all the clothes

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.118 position:13% line:83% align:start
we could find in the house
and had her try them on, but...

00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:47.689 position:7% line:83% align:start
We don't have one single outfit
that will do her justice!

00:19:47.822 --> 00:19:48.523 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:19:48.923 --> 00:19:50.457 position:30% line:83% align:start
It may be that
the only choice is

00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:52.325 position:33% line:83% align:start
to have a new
outfit made for her,

00:19:52.527 --> 00:19:54.227 position:30% line:83% align:start
but there's no
dressmaker in our fief

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:56.363 position:30% line:83% align:start
who sews things
worthy of nobility.

00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:58.766 position:27% line:83% align:start
You want to use a
dressmaker in the capital?

00:19:59.067 --> 00:20:00.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
We'd like you to go to town

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.436 position:27% line:83% align:start
and order a dress
in Licorice's size.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.672 position:24% line:83% align:start
If we can just get
the basic form made,

00:20:04.806 --> 00:20:06.941 position:21% line:83% align:start
we can add some fancy
embellishments to it here.

00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:09.677 position:16% line:83% align:start
Shouldn't father be able
to handle that on his own?

00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:10.611 position:30% line:89% align:start
Absolutely not!

00:20:10.745 --> 00:20:12.245 position:7% line:89% align:start
Licorice wouldn't want some man

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:13.614 position:10% line:89% align:start
to know her exact measurement

00:20:13.748 --> 00:20:15.348 position:30% line:83% align:start
and dress size,
now would she, Pastry?

00:20:15.482 --> 00:20:16.884 position:44% line:83% align:start
[PAS]
I'm a man too, though.

00:20:17.051 --> 00:20:19.787 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JOSEPHINE] That's not
the same. You're her fiance.

00:20:19.954 --> 00:20:21.455 position:19% line:89% align:start
Right, Licorice, dear?

00:20:22.056 --> 00:20:24.992 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't mind if Pas knows.
That's fine.

00:20:25.459 --> 00:20:26.861 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

00:20:28.162 --> 00:20:29.831 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh. She's my fiancee.

00:20:29.964 --> 00:20:31.899 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course, there aren't
any secrets between us.

00:20:32.033 --> 00:20:33.835 position:21% line:83% align:start
-You got that right!
-You got that right!

00:22:11.966 --> 00:22:14.202 position:7% line:83% align:start
[LICORICE] Father, I hope this
letter finds you well.

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:16.637 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's been a month since
my arrival in Morteln,

00:22:16.771 --> 00:22:18.606 position:27% line:83% align:start
so I thought you
might want an update.

00:22:19.574 --> 00:22:21.374 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are you baking
something in here, Pas?

00:22:21.943 --> 00:22:24.477 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's what you've been
waiting for, Licorice.

00:22:27.548 --> 00:22:28.850 position:24% line:89% align:start
It smells sublime!

00:22:29.083 --> 00:22:32.385 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a special cheesecake
made using goat's milk.

00:22:33.087 --> 00:22:34.222 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow!

00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:37.390 position:7% line:83% align:start
[LICORICE] The sweets that Pas
makes are like magic!

00:22:37.625 --> 00:22:39.660 position:16% line:89% align:start
He always makes me smile!

00:22:40.027 --> 00:22:41.062 position:38% line:89% align:start
[snoring]

00:22:42.395 --> 00:22:44.532 position:44% line:83% align:start
[PAS]
Hey! Wake up!

00:22:45.633 --> 00:22:47.568 position:13% line:89% align:start
Everyone's waiting on you.

00:22:48.002 --> 00:22:49.237 position:33% line:89% align:start
Come on, Pas!

00:22:49.369 --> 00:22:50.738 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't act like such a brat.

00:22:50.938 --> 00:22:53.040 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can eat the cake
right here in bed.

00:22:53.241 --> 00:22:54.208 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just bring it--

00:22:54.342 --> 00:22:56.409 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh. Oh, no. You're here, too?

00:22:56.711 --> 00:22:58.246 position:30% line:83% align:start
[JOSEPHINE] How
long were you watching?

00:22:58.378 --> 00:23:00.147 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ever since you first
fell asleep.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.817 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckling]

00:23:03.017 --> 00:23:04.518 position:35% line:83% align:start
[LICORICE]
Everyone's been so kind

00:23:04.652 --> 00:23:06.187 position:7% line:89% align:start
and they treat me like family.

00:23:06.486 --> 00:23:08.322 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm having great fun
every day.

00:23:08.723 --> 00:23:10.858 position:24% line:89% align:start
With love, Licorice

00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:14.494 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm glad she's happy,
but I miss her.

00:23:16.264 --> 00:23:18.566 position:7% line:89% align:start
How neat. What are you making?

00:23:21.468 --> 00:23:23.537 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh! That sounds good.

00:23:23.671 --> 00:23:25.740 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's okay to get your hopes up.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:26.908 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sweet!

00:23:28.109 --> 00:23:32.113 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª
