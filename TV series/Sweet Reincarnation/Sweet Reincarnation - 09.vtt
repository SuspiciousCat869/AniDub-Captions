are you certain of this?

I understand your purpose
in sending Lady Petra

to study in the royal capital

00:03:15.763 --> 00:03:18.365 position:13% line:83% align:start

of the Duke's family.

But why did you send
Lady Licorice

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:21.736 position:19% line:89% align:start
to the Fief of Morteln?

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.204 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't stand thinking
that sly woman

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.040 position:24% line:83% align:start
is hatching schemes
behind my back

Yes.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.381 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HUBAREK] It's obvious enough
that she has designs

[MALE ATTENDANT 1]
It is.

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:41.956 position:16% line:83% align:start
A woman exemplary enough
to maintain such tight control

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.425 position:7% line:83% align:start

the Fief of Morteln's potential.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.628 position:21% line:83% align:start
And all of a sudden,
she decides to invite him

00:03:47.762 --> 00:03:50.164 position:13% line:89% align:start
to a tea tasting ceremony?

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:51.733 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's so transparent.

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.400 position:35% line:89% align:start

with Lady Licorice
staying at the Morteln estate,

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:59.073 position:7% line:83% align:start

to accompany him to the party.

00:03:59.674 --> 00:04:01.809 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even for that vixen,
it would prove difficult

And of course,

just fatherly instinct

But they're not cheap either!

00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:05.573 position:27% line:83% align:start
I had to give up
all of my spending money

they'll still be too soft,

A tax exemption?

Sugary goods are taxed
very highly, as you must know.
