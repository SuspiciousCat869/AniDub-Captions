[CASSEROLE]
Agnes.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:14.314 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please stay calm
and hear me out.

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:17.317 position:7% line:89% align:start
My word dear, you look so pale.

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:19.486 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is something the matter?

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.321 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.057 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, I can guess!

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:25.459 position:27% line:89% align:start
You wasted money

00:00:25.593 --> 00:00:26.928 position:13% line:83% align:start
buying something frivolous
again, right?

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.663 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's just fine.

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:31.498 position:7% line:83% align:start
You know I've never gotten mad
at you over things like that!

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.868 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right.
So, what did you get me?

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:36.336 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE]
I'm so very sorry.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.839 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AGNES]
Tell me, dear.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.808 position:16% line:83% align:start
Agnes, there's a new girl
in my life!

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:43.043 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:47.447 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please forgive me.

00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:49.316 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh. [laughs]

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.419 position:10% line:83% align:start
I suppose this sort of thing
happens all the time, right?

00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:54.789 position:7% line:89% align:start
Though, it is rather shocking.

00:00:54.923 --> 00:00:56.758 position:35% line:89% align:start
[thunders]

00:00:56.891 --> 00:00:59.861 position:13% line:83% align:start
I didn't mean for any of it
to transpire the way it did

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.363 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I couldn't seem
to resist such a strong will.

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:07.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, is that so?
Tell me all about this girl.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.837 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course.
She's truly beautiful,

00:01:10.572 --> 00:01:12.507 position:10% line:89% align:start
With an impeccable pedigree.

00:01:13.608 --> 00:01:16.978 position:21% line:83% align:start
Really? Then I assume
she must be quite a charmer?

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.513 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE]
And she's a twin, too!

00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:22.550 position:21% line:89% align:start
Have you gone insane?

00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:25.419 position:10% line:83% align:start
Agnes, stop it! I should have
asked for your permission first.

00:01:25.553 --> 00:01:27.187 position:16% line:83% align:start
What? Why would you think
I'd ever agree

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:28.556 position:19% line:89% align:start
to something like that?

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.425 position:33% line:83% align:start
Um, well, Pas
has no objection to it,

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:33.995 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I think she's more than
an acceptable fiancÃ©e

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:35.295 position:27% line:89% align:start
for our dear son.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.832 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hm! Wait, Pas what?

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:40.068 position:27% line:89% align:start
He? He agreed to?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.636 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:44.438 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE] What did you think
I was talking about?

00:01:44.572 --> 00:01:47.207 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AGNES] I thought you were
confessing to an affair.

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:50.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
Father, how is Mother taking it?

00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:55.215 position:13% line:83% align:start
-She might need some time.
-So, she's really in shock?

00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:58.586 position:24% line:83% align:start
I expect it to last
at least a month.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.954 position:41% line:89% align:start
[cries]

00:02:00.088 --> 00:02:03.825 position:13% line:83% align:start
Another beautiful daughter?
I can't wait to meet her!

00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:08.596 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NARRATOR] This is the tale
of a genius pÃ¢tissier

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.865 position:16% line:83% align:start
whose dream of making the
world's greatest dessert

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:12.132 position:30% line:89% align:start
was cut short.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now, reincarnated
into another realm

00:02:14.102 --> 00:02:15.503 position:13% line:89% align:start
as the son of a poor noble,

00:02:15.637 --> 00:02:19.107 position:19% line:83% align:start
he pursues a world full
of desserts and smiles!

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.510 position:13% line:83% align:start
A tale that's syrupy sweet,
chock full of yummy treats

00:02:22.644 --> 00:02:25.079 position:33% line:83% align:start
and sprinkled
with bitter darkness.

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:27.715 position:7% line:89% align:start
A pastry chef, who was reborn,

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.384 position:19% line:83% align:start
and dreams of creating
this new world's

00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:32.887 position:16% line:89% align:start
very own land of sweets!

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:07.648 position:38% line:83% align:start
[COATON]
Count Retes! Your Ladyship!

00:04:09.617 --> 00:04:11.953 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're so loud.
What could it be?

00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:15.923 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's the heir to House Morteln.
He's just become engaged!

00:04:16.057 --> 00:04:17.558 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:04:17.692 --> 00:04:18.793 position:7% line:83% align:start
[COATON] He's been matched with
one of Margrave Hubarek's

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:20.094 position:24% line:89% align:start
younger daughters!

00:04:20.228 --> 00:04:21.461 position:21% line:89% align:start
How's that possible?

00:04:21.596 --> 00:04:23.463 position:27% line:83% align:start
That impoverished
backwater knight,

00:04:23.598 --> 00:04:25.233 position:10% line:89% align:start
joining the Margrave's house?

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:27.502 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh!

00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:32.173 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RETES]
That'll leave a blood red stain.

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:33.473 position:30% line:89% align:start
[clear throat]

00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:35.777 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why, I apologize
for startling you.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.046 position:41% line:83% align:start
Go on.
Which of his daughters is it?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.316 position:16% line:83% align:start
Uh! She's the fourth one,
Licorice Mille Hubarek.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.586 position:21% line:83% align:start
Twin sister to Petra,
who was recently engaged

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.023 position:21% line:83% align:start
to a different noble,
Duke Kadlecek's grandson Squale.

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:51.893 position:7% line:83% align:start
[RETES] She's the one involved
in the recent kidnapping.

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:55.196 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's right. It appears to be
an engagement

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:58.199 position:10% line:83% align:start
to prove her innocence in the
wake of the abduction incident.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:59.934 position:38% line:83% align:start
At least,
that's the vulgar rumor

00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:01.002 position:21% line:89% align:start
people are spreading.

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:02.603 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:05.006 position:19% line:83% align:start
[COATON] Do you suppose
there's any possibility

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.974 position:16% line:83% align:start
that the Hubareks intend
to wait a few years

00:05:07.108 --> 00:05:10.310 position:24% line:83% align:start
until the memory of
all this drama has faded away,

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:12.814 position:33% line:83% align:start
and dissolve
the engagement at that time?

00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:15.917 position:7% line:89% align:start
I don't think that's the case.

00:05:16.584 --> 00:05:18.753 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hubarek must have
another motive.

00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:20.955 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is it to set others
at ease regarding

00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:22.355 position:13% line:89% align:start
their family's intentions?

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.826 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh! That makes sense!

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:27.494 position:27% line:83% align:start
Once they joined
with Margrave Kadlecek's house,

00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:30.731 position:16% line:83% align:start
the sway of House Hubarek
grew significantly stronger.

00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:35.069 position:13% line:83% align:start
Indeed. Binding their house
to a minor one like Moreteln

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:36.737 position:13% line:89% align:start
is quite a strategic move.

00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:39.439 position:13% line:83% align:start
Essentially making the case
he has no further intentions

00:05:39.574 --> 00:05:42.043 position:16% line:83% align:start
of gaining power through
marriage politics.

00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:43.611 position:27% line:89% align:start
Truly impressive.

00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:46.214 position:5% line:83% align:start
[RETES] It's exactly the kind of
thing that shrewd man

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.515 position:30% line:89% align:start
would think of.

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:49.217 position:13% line:89% align:start
And there's one more thing.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.818 position:19% line:89% align:start
Though it is small now,

00:05:50.952 --> 00:05:53.154 position:27% line:83% align:start
he sees potential
in the Fief of Morteln,

00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:56.157 position:7% line:83% align:start
to grow into a bountiful land,
on par with my own.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.992 position:38% line:83% align:start
[COATON]
That could never happen!

00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:59.694 position:33% line:89% align:start
But what if.

00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:02.797 position:10% line:83% align:start
When that wasteland was first
granted to him twenty years ago,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.200 position:10% line:83% align:start
it was a trap to ensure young
Lord Casserole's failure.

00:06:06.334 --> 00:06:09.637 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've heard it took them years
to produce their first harvest.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.706 position:5% line:89% align:start
Though, in the past three years,

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.541 position:21% line:83% align:start
they've reduced their
wheat yield,

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:16.577 position:10% line:83% align:start
and began to cultivate beans.
The result?

00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:19.347 position:7% line:83% align:start
By using the abundance of beans
as fertilizer

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:20.715 position:21% line:89% align:start
to nourish the soil,

00:06:20.848 --> 00:06:23.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
they've improved
subsequent wheat harvests.

00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:24.986 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's brilliant.

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:27.588 position:21% line:83% align:start
And who do you think
was behind that bright idea?

00:06:27.722 --> 00:06:29.290 position:19% line:83% align:start
Could it not have been
the suggestion

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:31.125 position:10% line:89% align:start
of that silver-haired child?

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:32.459 position:38% line:83% align:start
[COATON]
Impossible!

00:06:32.593 --> 00:06:35.196 position:38% line:83% align:start
You know
he's only nine years old, right?

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:36.898 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yes well, have you forgotten

00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:40.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
when they came here to negotiate
compensation for the bandits?

00:06:41.535 --> 00:06:43.237 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was surprised to find
that Lord Morteln

00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:46.207 position:30% line:83% align:start
was not the one
conducting the negotiations,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.942 position:27% line:89% align:start
it was his child.

00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:50.978 position:10% line:83% align:start
And I'll admit he completely
got the better of me.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.882 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's no room for doubt.

00:06:55.016 --> 00:06:58.019 position:10% line:83% align:start
That sly old fox has noticed
the boy's potential.

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:00.588 position:16% line:89% align:start
I've been outmaneuvered.

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:05.826 position:38% line:89% align:start
[humming]

There we go!

00:07:11.866 --> 00:07:13.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
All right Lord Pas,
that should be it!

00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:15.803 position:7% line:89% align:start
Great, thank you for your help!

00:07:16.404 --> 00:07:18.506 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey Pas, what's in all these?

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:19.974 position:35% line:89% align:start
Is it food?

00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:22.310 position:33% line:83% align:start
Duke Kadlecek
and his grandson, Lord Squale,

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.644 position:5% line:89% align:start
have sent the goods I asked for!

00:07:23.778 --> 00:07:25.379 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've been waiting for them
to arrive!

00:07:25.513 --> 00:07:27.081 position:7% line:89% align:start
During their engagement party,

00:07:27.214 --> 00:07:29.083 position:21% line:83% align:start
I got them to promise
to help our fief

00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:31.218 position:24% line:83% align:start
and give us the aid
we need to grow!

00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:34.522 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Aah!
-Uh?

Here's what I think.

00:14:23.497 --> 00:14:25.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
We should go ahead and plant

00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:02.870 position:21% line:83% align:start
who exactly went over
that suzerain lord's head

00:20:03.004 --> 00:20:04.572 position:16% line:89% align:start
to dig a reservoir, huh?

00:20:04.706 --> 00:20:08.109 position:7% line:83% align:start
As the liege lord's successor,
I was acting on his behalf.

00:20:08.241 --> 00:20:11.179 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know you've got
a real smart mouth on ya, kid.

00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:12.379 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wow, thank you!

00:20:12.513 --> 00:20:13.514 position:19% line:89% align:start
It wasn't a compliment!

00:20:13.648 --> 00:20:14.949 position:16% line:89% align:start
If you've got complaints,

00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:17.085 position:10% line:83% align:start
direct them at this guy right
here! Go on now!

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:20.320 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Really lay into him!
-Sure, I'll keep that in mind.

00:20:20.988 --> 00:20:24.726 position:13% line:83% align:start
And by the way, do you know
why my father's not around?

00:20:24.859 --> 00:20:28.196 position:7% line:83% align:start
He had to fly off for business
at the royal capital.

00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:30.198 position:7% line:89% align:start
Guess he's still not back yet.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.799 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, too bad.

00:20:31.933 --> 00:20:35.069 position:13% line:83% align:start
[gasps] Something you need
to talk to him about, kid?

00:20:35.203 --> 00:20:37.839 position:7% line:89% align:start
I guess. I got this invitation,

00:20:37.972 --> 00:20:41.274 position:16% line:83% align:start
Count Retes has asked me
to attend a tea ceremony.

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:43.111 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just you specifically?

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:46.681 position:13% line:83% align:start
[PAS] Yeah. I'm pretty sure
she's plotting something.

00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:48.916 position:19% line:89% align:start
That seems very likely.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.319 position:19% line:83% align:start
It felt like something
Father should be aware of.

00:20:52.452 --> 00:20:54.421 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE]
I already know all about it.

00:20:56.057 --> 00:20:57.525 position:13% line:89% align:start
I heard it in the capital.

00:20:57.658 --> 00:20:59.961 position:16% line:83% align:start
And not from Count Retes,
before you ask.

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:02.029 position:10% line:89% align:start
What could she be up to now?

00:21:02.597 --> 00:21:04.031 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:21:04.165 --> 00:21:05.867 position:21% line:83% align:start
Does she want revenge
for how I handled the bandit

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.635 position:16% line:89% align:start
compensation discussion?

00:21:07.769 --> 00:21:10.337 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, we'll talk
about that later.

00:21:10.872 --> 00:21:14.108 position:19% line:83% align:start
Anyway, I've brought an
important guest with me today.

00:21:14.242 --> 00:21:15.209 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who's here?

00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:18.146 position:35% line:89% align:start
[footsteps]

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:21.215 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[sighs]
-Lady Licorice!

00:21:21.348 --> 00:21:23.718 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:21:23.851 --> 00:21:28.288 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hello, Lord Pastry!
Oops, I beg your pardon.

00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:32.026 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's just Pastry.
I wanted to see you again.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.697 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ah, it's you, My Lady!
I'm happy to see you, as well.

00:21:36.831 --> 00:21:41.269 position:21% line:83% align:start
A surprise visit from
your lovely fiancÃ©e? Lucky you.

00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:42.737 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE]
Not merely a visit.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.238 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:21:44.371 --> 00:21:45.673 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please forgive me,

00:21:45.807 --> 00:21:47.307 position:21% line:83% align:start
there's a good reason
I'll be imposing

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.143 position:5% line:89% align:start
on your hospitality for a while.

00:21:49.277 --> 00:21:54.615 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm confused. You mean
you're going to be living here?

00:21:55.883 --> 00:21:57.552 position:47% line:89% align:start
Um?

00:21:58.719 --> 00:21:59.887 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:22:00.021 --> 00:22:03.624 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:22:06.127 --> 00:22:08.830 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sighs] Uh?

00:23:44.692 --> 00:23:47.161 position:30% line:83% align:start
[PAS] Next time
on Sweet Reincarnation.

00:23:47.295 --> 00:23:48.629 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sweet or Bitter?

00:23:48.763 --> 00:23:52.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Tea Tasting Ceremony.
Bon appÃ©tit!
