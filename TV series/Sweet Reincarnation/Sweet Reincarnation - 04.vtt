the two villages we had

didn't help our situation any

I'd stay up all night

00:06:46.841 --> 00:06:48.776 position:33% line:83% align:start
brainstorming
with my fellow chefs!

00:06:50.144 --> 00:06:51.979 position:19% line:89% align:start
All right. Let's do it.

00:06:52.113 --> 00:06:53.047 position:27% line:89% align:start
Go ahead and draw

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.649 position:21% line:83% align:start
whatever you want to
in the dirt.

00:06:54.782 --> 00:06:56.350 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, just draw anything?

00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:57.752 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

Oh, is that a dragon?

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.868 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:16.170 position:13% line:83% align:start
I thought it was a drawing

Oh.

Sure is! [giggles]

What's that next to it?

A hot bonka pie, obviously!

00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:31.352 position:16% line:83% align:start

Uh, excuse me?

00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:34.454 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yours just looks like
a creepy snake

How about I just demonstrate
my spell for you guys?

Oh! That's so wicked!
Now, my drawing's on me.

00:08:13.527 --> 00:08:14.962 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's crazy!

00:08:15.096 --> 00:08:17.465 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, you really do know
how to use magic, don't you Pas?

00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:19.967 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, you have seen me
use it before.

00:08:22.203 --> 00:08:23.537 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LUMI]
It's not rubbing off.

00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:26.741 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah, it fades away
in three-ish days on skin.

00:08:27.174 --> 00:08:29.977 position:13% line:83% align:start
But it's permanent on trees
and walls, and stuff.

00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:32.013 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's like the coolest trick
ever!

00:08:32.146 --> 00:08:32.913 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:08:33.047 --> 00:08:34.849 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wanna show it to my Grandpa!

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.185 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hey, Pas,
can you do the opposite?

00:08:38.319 --> 00:08:39.286 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.088 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, um, like how?

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:44.692 position:10% line:83% align:start
Instead of copying a drawing
onto something,

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:47.461 position:24% line:83% align:start
could you transfer
something else into a drawing?

00:08:47.595 --> 00:08:49.663 position:16% line:83% align:start
[PAS] Transfer something
into a drawing?

00:08:49.797 --> 00:08:51.065 position:19% line:83% align:start
Like putting the image
of a house

00:08:51.198 --> 00:08:53.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
or of someone's face
onto the ground?

00:08:53.768 --> 00:08:55.669 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think that'd be something
pretty special.

00:08:55.803 --> 00:08:58.039 position:19% line:83% align:start
That don't make a dang
lick of sense, Lumi!

Oh, wow perfect!

Ah!

Sorry, I put my hands
on your wife, Marc.

That gag's played out, Pas.

00:09:18.793 --> 00:09:22.329 position:19% line:83% align:start
But you may've given me
a really great idea!

00:09:24.065 --> 00:09:28.235 position:21% line:83% align:start
I see. The situation
with our finances is that dire?

00:09:28.369 --> 00:09:29.770 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:09:29.904 --> 00:09:32.940 position:16% line:83% align:start
But still, I'm not sure
we can rely on my family

00:09:33.074 --> 00:09:35.042 position:10% line:89% align:start
to offer us much assistance.

00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:36.243 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:38.479 position:13% line:89% align:start
I understand. Makes sense.

00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:40.515 position:44% line:83% align:start
[PAS]
Great news!

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:43.184 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've come up with a way
to make some money!

00:09:43.317 --> 00:09:46.353 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah? Spill it.
What's your idea?

00:09:46.487 --> 00:09:48.722 position:24% line:83% align:start
Father, you told me
about your attempts

00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:50.925 position:5% line:83% align:start
to arrange a marriage for Josie,
right?

00:09:51.358 --> 00:09:52.593 position:41% line:89% align:start
I did.

00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:54.929 position:38% line:83% align:start
[FEUILLE]
Little lady's 13 years old.

00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:57.431 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just about right
for marriage arrangement!

00:09:57.566 --> 00:10:00.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
Since you can move
with your teleportation spell,

00:10:00.569 --> 00:10:02.837 position:10% line:83% align:start
you probably try to take her
everywhere you can

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.172 position:5% line:83% align:start
to introduce her to new suitors,
right?

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.074 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE]
Yes.

00:10:07.208 --> 00:10:08.742 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm always happy
for the chance to show off

00:10:08.876 --> 00:10:11.178 position:30% line:83% align:start
how proud I am
of my beautiful daughter.

00:10:11.312 --> 00:10:12.847 position:44% line:83% align:start
[PAS]
But then,

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.683 position:16% line:83% align:start
what do parents who can't
utilize that sort of magic do?

00:10:16.217 --> 00:10:16.951 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:10:17.084 --> 00:10:18.819 position:10% line:89% align:start
The most effective strategy,

00:10:18.953 --> 00:10:21.455 position:13% line:83% align:start
well, I guess that would be
attending a royal banquet

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.990 position:30% line:89% align:start
at the capital.

00:10:23.124 --> 00:10:25.826 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's true, but travel
can prove so dangerous.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.329 position:41% line:83% align:start
Right,
and it's definitely not cheap!

00:10:28.462 --> 00:10:30.431 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's why they say
that when a noble travels,

00:10:30.565 --> 00:10:33.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
their money sprouts wings.
And flies away!

00:10:33.535 --> 00:10:34.935 position:35% line:89% align:start
With that,

00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:37.304 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was wondering if we could sell
something like this?

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:39.373 position:35% line:89% align:start
Replicate.

00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:45.312 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow!

00:10:45.446 --> 00:10:47.214 position:33% line:89% align:start
Look at that!

00:10:48.182 --> 00:10:49.683 position:13% line:89% align:start
What? Looks just like her!

00:10:49.817 --> 00:10:52.286 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's almost like looking
in a mirror!

00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:55.322 position:7% line:83% align:start
[PAC] I've decided to call them
"matchmaking photos."

00:10:55.456 --> 00:10:57.925 position:33% line:83% align:start
"Ask the heir
to the Fief of Morteln

00:10:58.058 --> 00:11:00.060 position:27% line:83% align:start
to use his magic
to make you a photo,

00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:01.896 position:5% line:89% align:start
and you can show off your child,

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:04.431 position:16% line:83% align:start
but without ever needing
to travel anywhere."

00:11:04.798 --> 00:11:06.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
So, that could be our pitch
to parents

00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:10.237 position:13% line:83% align:start
seeking arranged marriages!
How about it, Father?

00:11:11.372 --> 00:11:13.508 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess having knowledge
unrelated to sweets

00:11:13.642 --> 00:11:15.442 position:13% line:89% align:start
really comes in handy, too!

00:11:15.943 --> 00:11:17.144 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE]
Hmm.

00:11:17.278 --> 00:11:19.213 position:16% line:83% align:start
With such skillfully done
portraits,

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:22.584 position:24% line:83% align:start
we could fetch five
or even ten gold coins!

00:11:22.716 --> 00:11:24.351 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's far cheaper than a painting

00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:27.656 position:16% line:83% align:start
and being made from magic
means no fees for materials.

00:11:27.788 --> 00:11:29.423 position:27% line:83% align:start
Plenty of parents
would pay out the nose

00:11:29.558 --> 00:11:32.760 position:5% line:83% align:start
just for the chance to introduce
their child with a picture.

00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:34.529 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:11:34.663 --> 00:11:35.996 position:21% line:89% align:start
This just might work.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wait, wouldn't that mean
exposing Pas' magic?

00:11:39.733 --> 00:11:41.168 position:33% line:89% align:start
Seems risky.

00:11:41.302 --> 00:11:43.871 position:16% line:83% align:start
[PAS] It's not something
we'll be able to hide forever.

00:11:44.606 --> 00:11:46.073 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's not a bad idea.

00:11:46.207 --> 00:11:48.342 position:19% line:83% align:start
If we let people think
my magic is just used

00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:50.444 position:21% line:83% align:start
for making pictures,
it's a good cover story,

00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:53.113 position:13% line:83% align:start
and might allow me to hide
in plain sight.

00:11:53.247 --> 00:11:55.382 position:30% line:83% align:start
Pictures, huh?
I guess I can see it.

Right.

00:12:12.266 --> 00:12:14.935 position:13% line:83% align:start
is in the southern reaches
of the Holy Kingdom of Praulich.

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:18.305 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a remote location,
facing the sea on two sides.

00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:21.075 position:24% line:83% align:start
Within its borders,
there are four main villages

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:23.712 position:16% line:83% align:start
and over 50 smaller ones,
as well.

00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:25.680 position:24% line:83% align:start
[PAS] Roads connect
all of the villages

00:12:25.813 --> 00:12:29.049 position:21% line:83% align:start
to the local capital,
which also presides over them.

00:12:29.183 --> 00:12:31.620 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's one of the largest domains
in the south.

00:12:32.554 --> 00:12:36.890 position:13% line:59% align:start
And at the center of it all
is the local capital, Retesvale.

I have come here today

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:40.261 position:27% line:83% align:start
seeking a meeting
with Count Retes.

00:12:40.394 --> 00:12:44.231 position:7% line:83% align:start
I ask for safe passage within.
We've been expecting you.

00:12:44.566 --> 00:12:47.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wonder if he has come here
to express his displeasure

00:12:47.468 --> 00:12:49.604 position:30% line:83% align:start
at our failure
to crush the bandit threat?

[COATON] Chastisement
from a mere backwater noble

00:12:52.306 --> 00:12:55.075 position:24% line:83% align:start
is nothing to fear,
at least not for you, I assume?

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:57.244 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RETES]
Hmm. Perhaps so.

00:12:57.778 --> 00:13:01.482 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll butter him up and send him
on his way back to the country.

00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:08.489 position:38% line:83% align:start
My Lady,
the Lord of Morteln has arrived.

00:13:08.856 --> 00:13:10.157 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RETES]
Allow him in.

00:13:11.392 --> 00:13:13.494 position:30% line:83% align:start
We are pleased
to have you join us, milord.

00:13:13.628 --> 00:13:15.963 position:24% line:83% align:start
It is such an honor
to finally get to meet

00:13:16.096 --> 00:13:17.798 position:13% line:89% align:start
the famous Lord of Morteln.

Brioche Salgrade Mille Retes.

00:13:20.401 --> 00:13:24.171 position:21% line:59% align:start

[CASSEROLE]
Listen to me, Pas.

00:13:27.374 --> 00:13:29.443 position:35% line:83% align:start
Lady Retes
is the eldest daughter

00:13:29.577 --> 00:13:31.011 position:16% line:89% align:start
of the late Count Retes.

00:13:31.145 --> 00:13:33.280 position:27% line:83% align:start
Her predecessors
died in conflict,

00:13:33.414 --> 00:13:36.050 position:16% line:83% align:start
leaving her young nephew
as the only rightful heir

00:13:36.183 --> 00:13:38.687 position:35% line:83% align:start
at the time
when his father died in the war.

00:13:38.852 --> 00:13:42.089 position:16% line:83% align:start
Lady Retes was to assume
the position as his regent,

00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:44.425 position:16% line:83% align:start
but only until her nephew
came of age.

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:46.761 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, she's the current holder
of the fief?

00:13:46.894 --> 00:13:48.295 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:49.631 position:30% line:89% align:start
But tragically,

00:13:49.764 --> 00:13:52.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
her nephew died of illness
before he came of age.

00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:56.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am grateful to have this time
with you, Count Brioche Retes.

00:13:56.638 --> 00:13:57.938 position:21% line:89% align:start
The pleasure is mine.

She seems cordial enough.

I would be delighted.

Ah, look at those!

Baked treats, cookies?

00:14:25.834 --> 00:14:28.636 position:19% line:83% align:start
This tea is one of our
household businesses.

We've prepared
only the finest for your visit.

00:14:31.806 --> 00:14:33.407 position:16% line:89% align:start
Your teas are well known.

00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:36.210 position:30% line:83% align:start
Even throughout
the royal capital, milady.

00:14:39.313 --> 00:14:40.914 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes, truly excellent.

00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:42.349 position:21% line:89% align:start
The aroma and flavor

00:14:42.483 --> 00:14:44.485 position:30% line:83% align:start
both live up to
their reputation.

00:14:44.619 --> 00:14:47.254 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm truly pleased to hear
you think so.

00:14:49.858 --> 00:14:52.627 position:10% line:83% align:start
[PAS] I used to make cookies
like this all the time!

00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:54.763 position:16% line:83% align:start
The time and temperature
before you bake them

is what matters most!

00:15:11.412 --> 00:15:14.014 position:7% line:83% align:start
[RETES] I see you excel at more
than just military matters.

00:15:14.148 --> 00:15:15.315 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're quite famous

00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:17.117 position:33% line:83% align:start
for rendering
a barren land bountiful.

00:15:17.251 --> 00:15:18.352 position:16% line:89% align:start
That prompts me to think

00:15:18.485 --> 00:15:20.120 position:13% line:83% align:start
you're a wonderful leader,
as well.

00:15:20.254 --> 00:15:21.856 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thanks for the kind words.

00:15:21.989 --> 00:15:24.091 position:16% line:83% align:start
I strive hard to maintain
my own lands,

00:15:24.224 --> 00:15:25.492 position:21% line:89% align:start
but I'd love to hear

00:15:25.627 --> 00:15:27.194 position:13% line:83% align:start
about your administration's
agriculture.

00:15:27.327 --> 00:15:30.164 position:24% line:83% align:start
You have certainly
overestimated me, My Lady.

00:15:30.297 --> 00:15:31.699 position:16% line:89% align:start
You know, the real reason

00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:34.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
why the land can support
its people so well,

00:15:34.468 --> 00:15:36.937 position:10% line:83% align:start
is all because of the prowess
of my son!

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.306 position:7% line:83% align:start
I myself have very little to do
with it.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.510 position:7% line:89% align:start
My, your son then? How humble.

00:15:42.644 --> 00:15:45.312 position:13% line:83% align:start
While I shamefully struggle
just to keep my lands together,

00:15:45.446 --> 00:15:47.916 position:16% line:83% align:start
you refuse to take pride
in your many accomplishments.

[chuckles]

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:51.418 position:41% line:83% align:start
I know,
normally no one would believe

00:15:51.553 --> 00:15:54.923 position:16% line:83% align:start
such a young child could
be leading territorial reform,

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:58.192 position:19% line:83% align:start
and yet that's exactly
what he's doing.

00:15:59.026 --> 00:16:00.494 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RETES]
It must make you proud

00:16:00.628 --> 00:16:02.864 position:19% line:83% align:start
to have such a fine man
for a father.

Aw! I'm sure, he is.

However, my father

Even I and my fellow children
were forced

to take up swords and fight.

00:16:28.088 --> 00:16:29.323 position:41% line:83% align:start

Over a hundred?

just around 50,

00:16:31.826 --> 00:16:34.428 position:30% line:83% align:start

it's a strategic lie.

00:16:34.562 --> 00:16:37.397 position:33% line:83% align:start
Exaggeration
is a negotiator's trick.

00:16:37.532 --> 00:16:38.533 position:35% line:89% align:start
Damnation!

00:16:38.666 --> 00:16:40.835 position:30% line:83% align:start
I let the child
broach the subject.

00:16:41.636 --> 00:16:44.539 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's marvelous to see you
assuming the duties of nobility

00:16:44.672 --> 00:16:45.940 position:21% line:89% align:start
at such a young age.

00:16:46.073 --> 00:16:48.442 position:7% line:83% align:start
Our household could truly learn
from your example!

00:16:48.576 --> 00:16:51.813 position:10% line:83% align:start
Really? When we interrogated
the bandits we captured,

00:16:51.946 --> 00:16:55.015 position:33% line:83% align:start
they admitted
they'd come out of Retesvale.

00:16:55.482 --> 00:16:56.718 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:16:57.217 --> 00:16:59.386 position:7% line:83% align:start
[RETES] He's going to negotiate
for damages.

00:16:59.521 --> 00:17:00.922 position:16% line:89% align:start
I should feign ignorance.

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:04.258 position:10% line:83% align:start
Gracious, could that be true?
I hadn't heard that.

If you doubt my words,

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:09.196 position:10% line:83% align:start
we are prepared to hand over
some of the bandits to you.

00:17:09.731 --> 00:17:12.165 position:19% line:83% align:start
If that fails to spark
your memory,

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:14.034 position:30% line:83% align:start
we'll just turn
them over to the king.

00:17:14.167 --> 00:17:15.369 position:24% line:89% align:start
Doing so could lead

00:17:15.503 --> 00:17:16.771 position:10% line:83% align:start
to an official investigation
though.

00:17:16.905 --> 00:17:20.140 position:5% line:83% align:start
[RETES] Is that your preference?
This child.

00:17:20.474 --> 00:17:23.210 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then, assuming your theory
is correct,

00:17:23.343 --> 00:17:24.879 position:13% line:89% align:start
perhaps they're the bandits

00:17:25.013 --> 00:17:27.749 position:10% line:83% align:start
that our household eradicated
within this territory, no?

00:17:27.882 --> 00:17:30.552 position:30% line:83% align:start
Those remaining
must've escaped into Morteln.

00:17:31.653 --> 00:17:33.588 position:7% line:89% align:start
Regarding the County of Retes,

00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:36.189 position:27% line:83% align:start
attempts to stop
some bandits there have failed.

00:17:37.224 --> 00:17:38.258 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's odd.

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:39.861 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:17:39.994 --> 00:17:42.162 position:21% line:83% align:start

If you claim that
your household eradicated them,

00:17:46.935 --> 00:17:50.237 position:27% line:83% align:start
then whose forces
were the bandits escaping from?

Who would they've been fighting

Well, I'm afraid
I wouldn't know.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.378 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no proof
that the bandits we took down

00:17:58.513 --> 00:18:00.582 position:33% line:83% align:start
and your own
are even the same people.

00:18:00.715 --> 00:18:03.450 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's impossible to say
without all the details.

-Huh?

00:18:06.988 --> 00:18:10.324 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE] One of the bandits
was carrying this sword.

00:18:10.457 --> 00:18:12.694 position:5% line:89% align:start
It also bears your family crest.

00:18:14.227 --> 00:18:16.263 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sir, that's one of ours.

00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:17.799 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RETES]
They've got me.

00:18:18.365 --> 00:18:19.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's pretty clear,

00:18:19.934 --> 00:18:23.004 position:10% line:83% align:start
your household's suppression
of the bandits failed.

00:18:23.136 --> 00:18:24.505 position:33% line:89% align:start
As a result,

00:18:24.639 --> 00:18:26.541 position:19% line:83% align:start
our lands were attacked
because of your error.

00:18:27.307 --> 00:18:28.977 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's based on the evidence.

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:30.845 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't see it like that.

00:18:30.979 --> 00:18:33.548 position:24% line:83% align:start
[PAS] We understand
your position, of course.

00:18:33.681 --> 00:18:35.717 position:10% line:83% align:start
We don't plan to make a fuss
or investigate

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.217 position:24% line:83% align:start
the failed attempt
at suppression.

00:18:37.351 --> 00:18:38.653 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RETES]
I thank you.

00:18:38.786 --> 00:18:40.788 position:35% line:83% align:start
But still,
you may not claim them,

00:18:40.922 --> 00:18:43.457 position:27% line:83% align:start
but they did come
out of your territory.

00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:45.727 position:24% line:83% align:start
We would appreciate
compensation.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.830 position:30% line:83% align:start
For the trouble
it caused our fief, ma'am.

00:18:48.963 --> 00:18:50.665 position:21% line:89% align:start
For all your trouble?

00:18:51.699 --> 00:18:53.500 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm sure
we can reach an agreement.

00:18:53.635 --> 00:18:55.603 position:21% line:83% align:start
What's an appropriate
amount then?

00:18:55.737 --> 00:18:59.073 position:7% line:89% align:start
Perhaps, a hundred gold coins?

00:18:59.206 --> 00:19:00.440 position:33% line:89% align:start
Well, count,

00:19:00.575 --> 00:19:02.242 position:24% line:83% align:start
it'd only be right
if you cover the damages

00:19:02.376 --> 00:19:03.678 position:21% line:89% align:start
to our villages too.

00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:06.380 position:10% line:83% align:start
You don't speak like a child,
do you?

00:19:07.115 --> 00:19:09.550 position:19% line:89% align:start
Fine then, a 130 coins.

00:19:09.684 --> 00:19:10.618 position:35% line:89% align:start
Try again.

00:19:11.052 --> 00:19:12.987 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:19:13.121 --> 00:19:18.191 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:23.131 position:21% line:89% align:start
A hundred and fifty.

00:19:23.263 --> 00:19:25.733 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hm. That sounds fair.

00:19:25.867 --> 00:19:28.036 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, Father,
do you agree with me?

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.302 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:32.674 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RETES]
This child.

00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:35.242 position:21% line:89% align:start
He's an exceptional.

00:19:37.979 --> 00:19:40.548 position:10% line:83% align:start
Perhaps the Lord of Morteln's
words earlier,

00:19:40.682 --> 00:19:43.117 position:10% line:89% align:start
were more than mere humility.

00:19:44.085 --> 00:19:47.522 position:13% line:83% align:start
Normally, it is the father
who would conduct negotiations

00:19:47.889 --> 00:19:52.259 position:30% line:83% align:start
and yet still,
it is a small price to pay.

00:19:52.392 --> 00:19:53.895 position:16% line:89% align:start
A hundred and fifty coins

00:19:54.028 --> 00:19:56.698 position:16% line:83% align:start
and we avoid the risk of
damaging the king's trust in us

00:19:56.831 --> 00:19:59.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
for letting bandits escape
and ravage nearby lands.

00:19:59.934 --> 00:20:01.401 position:24% line:89% align:start
It could be worse.

00:20:01.536 --> 00:20:04.972 position:5% line:89% align:start
Father, look, a 150 gold coins!

00:20:05.106 --> 00:20:06.473 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:11.278 position:41% line:83% align:start
[RETES]
Perhaps, Pas,

00:20:11.411 --> 00:20:14.247 position:21% line:83% align:start
I underestimated you
because you're so young.

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.517 position:10% line:89% align:start
I must admit you defeated me.

00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:18.418 position:33% line:83% align:start
Do forgive me
for the things I said.

00:20:18.553 --> 00:20:20.121 position:24% line:89% align:start
I got quite saucy.

00:20:20.253 --> 00:20:23.758 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know, I don't believe
you ever introduced yourself.

00:20:24.192 --> 00:20:26.259 position:21% line:89% align:start
An unfortunate lapse.

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:28.963 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm Pastry,
Casserole Morteln's son

00:20:29.097 --> 00:20:30.798 position:10% line:89% align:start
and the pleasure is all mine.

00:20:30.932 --> 00:20:34.001 position:24% line:83% align:start
I very much enjoyed
making your acquaintance.

00:20:34.135 --> 00:20:36.637 position:5% line:89% align:start
Pastry, huh. I'll remember that.

00:20:36.771 --> 00:20:39.574 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's right,
may I ask you one more question?

00:20:39.707 --> 00:20:40.775 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:42.677 position:30% line:83% align:start
You made a face
when we had tea before.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.278 position:13% line:83% align:start
I thought you might've been
displeased by what you tried.

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:46.581 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah?

00:20:46.714 --> 00:20:48.750 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ow!
-Did it not suit your fancy?

00:20:48.883 --> 00:20:52.053 position:41% line:83% align:start
Oh, no,
the tea was most excellent.

00:20:52.186 --> 00:20:53.988 position:41% line:83% align:start
-But...
-[RETES] But?

00:20:54.122 --> 00:20:55.990 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just thought the cookies
that were served

00:20:56.124 --> 00:20:58.192 position:19% line:83% align:start
were a little too sweet
for my taste.

00:20:58.325 --> 00:20:59.827 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!
-[RETES] Oh?

00:20:59.961 --> 00:21:02.063 position:30% line:83% align:start
When you serve
baked treats with a good tea,

00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:04.799 position:13% line:83% align:start
it isn't all that difficult
to adjust the sweetness,

00:21:04.932 --> 00:21:07.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I think you might find
you'd like it much more.

00:21:07.502 --> 00:21:08.970 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Sh- Pas!
-So next time,

00:21:09.103 --> 00:21:11.005 position:13% line:83% align:start
you should try pairing it
with something less sweet.

00:21:11.139 --> 00:21:14.075 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you do that,
the cookies will enhance the tea

00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:17.344 position:10% line:83% align:start
and make the tea and desserts
a far more enjoyable pairing!

00:21:17.477 --> 00:21:19.346 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, my goodness.

00:21:19.479 --> 00:21:21.516 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm impressed
by your refined palate.

00:21:21.649 --> 00:21:22.784 position:19% line:83% align:start
A great trick to reduce
the sweet...

00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:25.953 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE]
[screams] Pas!

A thousand apologies.

00:21:31.058 --> 00:21:34.195 position:27% line:83% align:start
[RETES] I thought
he was merely precocious, but...

00:21:34.327 --> 00:21:36.798 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, wait.
I hope you'll forgive me.

00:21:36.931 --> 00:21:39.299 position:13% line:83% align:start
I forgot to bring a present
for you.

00:21:39.432 --> 00:21:41.702 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here, take this. You'll like it.

00:21:43.237 --> 00:21:44.539 position:35% line:89% align:start

âª

00:22:00.788 --> 00:22:03.791 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is amazing. Thank you.

00:22:04.592 --> 00:22:06.326 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's to show my thanks.

00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:07.895 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not just for the sweets,

00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:10.865 position:19% line:83% align:start
but for Your Ladyships
most gracious contribution.
