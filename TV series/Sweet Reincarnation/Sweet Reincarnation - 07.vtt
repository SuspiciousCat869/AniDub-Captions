We captured and arrested a man

Duke Luhaingo Armire.

00:05:06.574 --> 00:05:08.676 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was twenty years ago,
during the great war,

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.045 position:7% line:83% align:start
that they were investigated and
stripped of title, I believe.

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:13.446 position:13% line:83% align:start
Right, and they were purged
on suspicion

of secretly communicating
with the enemy.

00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:17.712 position:27% line:83% align:start
that there wasn't
much power left

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:19.446 position:13% line:89% align:start
in his spell's activation.

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:23.618 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're suggesting he didn't
have very much magic remaining?

Even if he did manage
to dig a hole and escape,

00:06:28.923 --> 00:06:31.125 position:16% line:83% align:start
he probably wouldn't have
had enough power left

To think he could get away

to you he's terrified?

00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:17.318 position:10% line:83% align:start
Not only is he uncomfortable
with pageantry,

00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:19.353 position:19% line:83% align:start
he's also sitting next
to his future bride,

Well, I think Lord Squale looks

00:10:24.358 --> 00:10:26.561 position:13% line:83% align:start
as if he's enjoying himself
quite a bit.

00:10:26.694 --> 00:10:28.229 position:5% line:89% align:start
I had hoped that getting engaged

00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:30.030 position:30% line:83% align:start
would help him
become more mature

and might even turn him
into a reliable family man.

But if a man with your military

00:10:35.537 --> 00:10:36.837 position:24% line:89% align:start
he looks carefree,

00:10:36.971 --> 00:10:39.940 position:27% line:83% align:start
well then perhaps
I should reevaluate my grandson.

00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:01.028 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KADLECEK]
Curious aspects?

00:11:01.162 --> 00:11:02.363 position:41% line:89% align:start
Namely,

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:05.099 position:13% line:83% align:start
between the bandit's skill
and his meticulousness

00:11:05.232 --> 00:11:07.134 position:35% line:83% align:start
in securing
multiple strongholds,

00:11:07.268 --> 00:11:09.571 position:16% line:83% align:start
he seemed to be extremely
well prepared.

00:11:09.937 --> 00:11:11.205 position:7% line:89% align:start
But despite all that planning,

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:13.040 position:27% line:83% align:start
he still managed
to make the fundamental

00:11:13.174 --> 00:11:15.876 position:27% line:83% align:start
and fatal mistake
of kidnapping the wrong target.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.444 position:13% line:89% align:start
Which leads me to question

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:18.946 position:10% line:83% align:start
whether this could have been
the result of someone

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:20.214 position:16% line:89% align:start
working behind the scenes

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:21.882 position:27% line:83% align:start
who intentionally
fed the kidnappers

00:11:22.016 --> 00:11:24.553 position:19% line:83% align:start
misleading information
regarding Lady Petra.

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:26.921 position:19% line:83% align:start
And for a fallen noble
to have the connections,

00:11:27.054 --> 00:11:29.757 position:16% line:83% align:start
one would need to prepare
multiple bases of operations

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.192 position:16% line:89% align:start
within the royal capital.

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:33.994 position:38% line:83% align:start
[scoffs]
That doesn't seem likely.

00:11:34.128 --> 00:11:35.329 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can't shake the feeling

00:11:35.462 --> 00:11:37.965 position:19% line:83% align:start
that nothing about this
seems to add up.

00:11:38.098 --> 00:11:39.433 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:41.603 position:30% line:83% align:start
[PAS] However,
I do have a theory.

00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:44.738 position:7% line:83% align:start
All of my confusion disappears
if there was a third party

00:11:44.872 --> 00:11:46.675 position:13% line:83% align:start
with a completely different

A third party, you say?

00:11:51.212 --> 00:11:53.080 position:30% line:83% align:start
Someone to leak
the misleading information,

00:11:53.214 --> 00:11:55.149 position:24% line:83% align:start
prepare connections
in a roundabout way,

00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:57.851 position:10% line:83% align:start
and who has enough authority
to overlook an Armire

having headquarters
in the capital.

Oh, and who might that be, boy?

00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:07.629 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, who benefits the most

[KADLECEK]
Benefits?

00:12:11.765 --> 00:12:14.735 position:13% line:83% align:start
This mastermind had clearly
earned House Armire's ire,

00:12:14.868 --> 00:12:16.571 position:21% line:83% align:start
so it must be someone
who gained power

[sighs]

00:12:19.907 --> 00:12:21.942 position:10% line:83% align:start
Furthermore, doesn't it seem
likely that their real motive

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:23.344 position:10% line:89% align:start
would be to use the incident

00:12:23.477 --> 00:12:25.179 position:24% line:83% align:start

any remaining chance

Hm.

Not at all, Your Grace.

00:12:40.662 --> 00:12:42.664 position:13% line:83% align:start

[clears throat]

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.395 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's true that I was looking
for an opportunity

As for this abduction incident,

00:14:26.266 --> 00:14:28.703 position:21% line:83% align:start
I did give the orders

That said...

00:14:32.373 --> 00:14:34.208 position:27% line:83% align:start
I most certainly
had no intention

I will confess that
I arranged the entire affair.

And no matter
what excuse I might make,

00:14:47.187 --> 00:14:49.923 position:19% line:83% align:start
the truth is that I put
Lady Licorice in danger.

00:14:50.057 --> 00:14:51.992 position:21% line:83% align:start
I humbly acknowledge
the accusations

there is no such thing

I must ask,

00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:46.980 position:24% line:83% align:start
do you already have
