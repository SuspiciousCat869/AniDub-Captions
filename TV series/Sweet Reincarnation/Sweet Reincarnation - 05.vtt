00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:10.845 position:7% line:65% align:start
[KADLECEK] Thank you for coming
all this way, Lord Morteln.

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:12.847 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's nice to see you again.

00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:14.381 position:27% line:89% align:start
Truly a pleasure.

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:17.217 position:21% line:83% align:start
The pleasure is mine,
Your Grace. I assure you.

00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:20.989 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hear congratulations
are in order

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.023 position:19% line:83% align:start
for your eldest's heir
coming of age.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:24.659 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, he may have grown older,

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:27.629 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I'd say he is still
very much a child.

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:30.264 position:10% line:83% align:start
I must also express my honor
at having been invited

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:31.966 position:7% line:89% align:start
to such an incredible banquet,

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.002 position:33% line:83% align:start
by the leader
of the central army.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.369 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:00:35.503 --> 00:00:37.772 position:16% line:83% align:start
That is quite flattering
coming from a hero

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:39.741 position:5% line:89% align:start
of your reputation, my good sir!

00:00:39.874 --> 00:00:42.175 position:35% line:83% align:start
By the way,
this is my grandson, Squale.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.278 position:5% line:89% align:start
He graduated first in his class

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.146 position:24% line:83% align:start
from the officers'
boarding school.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.215 position:13% line:89% align:start
An impressive achievement.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.785 position:16% line:83% align:start
[gasps] It is an absolute
honor to meet you.

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:52.554 position:21% line:89% align:start
I mean that, My Lord!

00:00:52.687 --> 00:00:55.455 position:10% line:83% align:start
I am likewise pleased to make
your acquaintance, Lord Squale.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.660 position:13% line:83% align:start
However, seeing as how you
are my superior in rank,

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:01.361 position:21% line:83% align:start
I must humbly insist
that you call me "Casserole."

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.531 position:16% line:83% align:start
Right! Forgive the error,
My Lord!

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:06.266 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[whimpering]
-Enough! Loosen up, my boy.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.335 position:30% line:83% align:start
Please forgive
this silly display.

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:10.638 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's told me how much
he idolizes you.

00:01:10.772 --> 00:01:12.306 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's been looking forward
to meeting you

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.008 position:21% line:89% align:start
for a long while now.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.710 position:21% line:89% align:start
Blame the minstrels.

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:18.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
It seems their tantalizing tales
of your heroic exploits

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.481 position:16% line:83% align:start
have made you practically
a legend among our youth.

00:01:21.616 --> 00:01:24.351 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can hardly think
of a greater honor.

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:25.920 position:27% line:89% align:start
And who is this?

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:27.889 position:21% line:89% align:start
Your son, I presume?

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:28.923 position:38% line:89% align:start
Correct.

00:01:29.057 --> 00:01:31.124 position:16% line:89% align:start
Pas, introduce yourself.

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.531 position:33% line:83% align:start
I am honored
to make your acquaintance.

00:01:36.664 --> 00:01:39.399 position:33% line:83% align:start
I am the son
of Casserole Mille Morteln.

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:41.569 position:19% line:89% align:start
You may call me Pastry.

00:01:41.703 --> 00:01:43.270 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:44.872 position:38% line:89% align:start
[smirks]

âª

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:50.444 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NARRATOR] This is the tale
of a genius patissier,

00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:52.747 position:21% line:83% align:start
whose dream of making
the world's greatest dessert

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.082 position:30% line:89% align:start
was cut short.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:55.917 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, reincarnated
into another realm

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.451 position:13% line:89% align:start
as the son of a poor noble,

00:01:57.585 --> 00:02:00.788 position:24% line:83% align:start
he pursues a world
full of desserts and smiles!

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:04.491 position:13% line:83% align:start
A tale that's syrupy sweet,
chock full of yummy treats,

00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:07.227 position:33% line:83% align:start
and sprinkled
with bitter darkness.

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:09.631 position:10% line:89% align:start
A pastry chef, who was reborn

00:02:09.764 --> 00:02:14.702 position:5% line:83% align:start
and dreams of creating this new
world's very own land of sweets!

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.663 position:16% line:53% align:start
Greetings, my Lord Squale
and congratulations.

00:03:48.796 --> 00:03:51.498 position:21% line:53% align:start
Ascension to manhood
is no small feat.

00:03:51.632 --> 00:03:53.501 position:35% line:83% align:start
I thank you
for this auspicious audience.

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:55.302 position:21% line:89% align:start
It is truly an honor.

00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:57.038 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Right!

00:03:57.572 --> 00:04:00.141 position:30% line:83% align:start
You flatter me
with your most elegant words!

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.210 position:24% line:83% align:start
I am unworthy of...
[groans] Ow.

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.579 position:13% line:89% align:start
[laughs] Pure magnificence!

00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:06.948 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're rather more put together
than my own grandson,

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:08.381 position:35% line:89% align:start
aren't you?

00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:09.917 position:13% line:83% align:start
As it were, I heard a rumor
floating about

00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:12.385 position:24% line:83% align:start
that you have also
recently come of age.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.756 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tell me, were you endowed
with magic at that time?

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.759 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yes, only by the grace of God,
of course.

00:04:17.892 --> 00:04:21.162 position:5% line:83% align:start
I too, was blessed with the gift
of magical ability.

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:22.663 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:25.166 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KADLECEK] For both father
and son to be so gifted,

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:27.101 position:30% line:83% align:start
it is apparent
that House Morteln

00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:29.203 position:10% line:89% align:start
has earned God's good favor.

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:31.939 position:19% line:83% align:start
I cannot imagine a more
wonderful thought than that.

00:04:32.073 --> 00:04:34.776 position:19% line:83% align:start
Though it may be merely
a coincidence.

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:36.043 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:04:36.177 --> 00:04:37.612 position:7% line:89% align:start
I believe luck was on my side.

00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:40.313 position:10% line:83% align:start
Nothing more and nothing less
than pure luck.

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.282 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:43.851 position:16% line:89% align:start
I respect your humility.

00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:46.854 position:21% line:83% align:start
Would you be so kind
as to demonstrate your magic?

00:04:47.088 --> 00:04:49.524 position:7% line:83% align:start
If it would please Your Grace,
then of course!

00:04:49.657 --> 00:04:51.324 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now then, might I trouble you

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.895 position:7% line:83% align:start
to hold out that cloth for me,
please?

00:04:54.028 --> 00:04:55.563 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, do as he says.

Oh!

-That is quite impressive, boy!
-Oh!

00:05:14.682 --> 00:05:16.017 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KADLECEK]
Fascinating.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.219 position:19% line:83% align:start
A spell that allows you
to create pictures.

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:19.687 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's truly spectacular!

00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:21.321 position:7% line:83% align:start
[PAS] Thank you for the praise,
Your Grace.

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:23.624 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah!
-If I may be so bold,

00:05:23.758 --> 00:05:25.159 position:10% line:89% align:start
I wish to offer this picture

00:05:25.293 --> 00:05:27.360 position:38% line:83% align:start
as a gift
to Lord Squale Kadlecek.

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:28.863 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:31.232 position:16% line:83% align:start
From myself and on behalf
of Margrave Hubarek

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:32.800 position:19% line:89% align:start
and his lovely family.

00:05:32.934 --> 00:05:35.069 position:7% line:89% align:start
A token from Margrave Hubarek?

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:37.939 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yet he doesn't appear
to be in attendance today.

00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:40.975 position:24% line:83% align:start
Am I to understand
that this girl is...

00:05:41.108 --> 00:05:42.342 position:41% line:89% align:start
Indeed.

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.312 position:24% line:83% align:start
The third daughter
of Margrave Hubarek,

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.147 position:16% line:89% align:start
the charming. Lady Petra.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.917 position:13% line:83% align:start
Prior to our arrival here,
my father used his magic

00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:52.053 position:19% line:83% align:start
to visit the Margravate
of Hubarek,

00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:53.688 position:13% line:89% align:start
whereupon we met with them.

00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:55.189 position:19% line:89% align:start
As you are well aware,

00:05:55.323 --> 00:05:57.525 position:19% line:83% align:start
the Margravate has been
consistently embroiled

00:05:57.658 --> 00:05:59.426 position:27% line:83% align:start
in a bitter feud
with its neighbor.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.696 position:16% line:83% align:start
This makes it challenging
for Lady Petra

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:03.197 position:16% line:89% align:start
to leave their territory.

00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:04.832 position:7% line:89% align:start
That is why the margrave asked

00:06:04.966 --> 00:06:07.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
if we might introduce her
on his behalf.

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:10.504 position:21% line:89% align:start
Lady Petra. My word.

00:06:10.638 --> 00:06:12.974 position:13% line:89% align:start
She is a vision of beauty!

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:15.142 position:33% line:89% align:start
[both smirk]

00:06:15.276 --> 00:06:17.345 position:13% line:83% align:start
[PAS] Lady Petra is holding
a celebration next month

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.614 position:13% line:89% align:start
for her own coming of age.

00:06:19.747 --> 00:06:21.215 position:16% line:89% align:start
Her dearest wish is this,

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:24.417 position:21% line:83% align:start
that you will attend
as an expression of friendship.

00:06:24.552 --> 00:06:25.720 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm afraid we--

00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:27.454 position:27% line:83% align:start
If she wishes it,
I shall be there!

00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:29.422 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KADLECEK]
My foolish grandson!

00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:30.925 position:21% line:89% align:start
Responding so quickly

00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:32.894 position:10% line:83% align:start
without even a second thought
of his station!

00:06:33.027 --> 00:06:34.528 position:33% line:83% align:start
Can't he see
that they're scheming

00:06:34.662 --> 00:06:36.764 position:19% line:89% align:start
to arrange a marriage?!

00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:38.633 position:38% line:89% align:start
This boy.

00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:42.003 position:19% line:83% align:start
Although he's a child,
I must not underestimate him.

00:06:42.136 --> 00:06:44.572 position:16% line:83% align:start
What is the precise date
of this occasion?

00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:46.340 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't get ahead of yourself,
Squale.

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:49.977 position:16% line:83% align:start
How exactly do you intend
to travel such a great distance?

00:06:50.378 --> 00:06:51.646 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah?

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:53.214 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's no need to worry
about such a thing.

00:06:53.347 --> 00:06:54.148 position:35% line:89% align:start
We'll help.

00:06:54.282 --> 00:06:55.482 position:41% line:89% align:start
How so?

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:56.617 position:24% line:83% align:start
My father would be
more than willing

00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:58.085 position:5% line:89% align:start
to lend his magic to the cause.

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:00.721 position:7% line:83% align:start
Do you hear that, Grandfather?
What great news!

00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:02.256 position:21% line:83% align:start
It will be no trouble

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.691 position:13% line:89% align:start
to attend the celebration.

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:06.394 position:24% line:83% align:start
And it's all thanks
to Lord Morteln's magic!

[grunts]

00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:09.096 position:19% line:89% align:start
You really don't mind?

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.431 position:19% line:83% align:start
I would hate to impose
too greatly on you.

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:13.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's no trouble at all.

00:07:14.235 --> 00:07:16.469 position:19% line:89% align:start
Squale. Heaven's sake.

00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:17.772 position:44% line:83% align:start
[PAS]
Your Grace.

00:07:17.905 --> 00:07:18.940 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:07:20.408 --> 00:07:23.377 position:13% line:83% align:start
You should know that during
our visit it appeared to me

00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:25.613 position:27% line:83% align:start
that Lord Hubarek
had ulterior motives.

00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:26.981 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KADLECEK]
Ulterior motives?

00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:28.816 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't help but suspect
that the margrave

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.185 position:30% line:83% align:start
has grown weary
of the constant border disputes

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:33.020 position:5% line:89% align:start
that have long plagued his land.

00:07:33.154 --> 00:07:35.823 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hm? What does that have to do
with anything?

00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:39.760 position:16% line:83% align:start
[PAS] It only makes sense
that he would desire

00:07:39.894 --> 00:07:42.697 position:13% line:83% align:start
to use the awesome military
power Your Grace controls

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.266 position:33% line:83% align:start
to stamp out
his opponent's will to fight

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:47.201 position:10% line:89% align:start
and end the feuding forever.

00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:51.405 position:13% line:83% align:start
I believe he may be seeking
a romantic match

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:53.507 position:10% line:89% align:start
in order to achieve that end.

00:07:55.376 --> 00:07:56.777 position:27% line:89% align:start
That makes sense.

00:07:57.878 --> 00:08:00.815 position:16% line:83% align:start
I will bear that in mind.
You have my thanks.

00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:04.518 position:13% line:83% align:start
All merely my own unfounded
speculation, of course.

00:08:04.952 --> 00:08:07.221 position:30% line:83% align:start
Out of respect
for his kind invitation,

00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:10.358 position:13% line:83% align:start
I shall attend these joyous
festivities as well!

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.728 position:24% line:83% align:start
Perhaps my grandson
will find his romantic destiny.

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:16.530 position:24% line:83% align:start
At the very least,
it will surely make a good story

00:08:16.664 --> 00:08:18.299 position:10% line:89% align:start
to take back to His Majesty!

00:08:18.432 --> 00:08:20.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
[PAS] He bellowed that
declaration as loud as he could

00:08:21.035 --> 00:08:22.737 position:21% line:83% align:start
to make sure everyone
around us heard.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.741 position:13% line:83% align:start
I shall be counting on you.
We're in your able hands.

00:08:27.475 --> 00:08:29.510 position:13% line:89% align:start
I am honored by your trust.

00:08:30.211 --> 00:08:32.213 position:19% line:83% align:start
[PAS] He strategically
declared his plan

00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:33.481 position:16% line:89% align:start
to keep the king informed

00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:35.082 position:19% line:83% align:start
so that his intentions
are clear.

00:08:35.216 --> 00:08:37.952 position:10% line:83% align:start
He acts in the best interests
of the kingdom.

[guests mumbling]

00:08:45.426 --> 00:08:49.030 position:21% line:83% align:start
Lord Pastry Morteln,
in honor of this occasion,

00:08:49.163 --> 00:08:52.133 position:10% line:83% align:start
may I ask that you address me
as Squale from now on?

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:53.734 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah?

00:08:53.868 --> 00:08:55.970 position:24% line:83% align:start
Honestly, I'm a bit
uncomfortable with formalities.

00:08:56.103 --> 00:08:57.905 position:13% line:89% align:start
I understand. In that case,

00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:00.741 position:19% line:83% align:start
I do hope you'll agree
to call me Pastry in return.

00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:04.311 position:19% line:83% align:start
As you wish, and while
I have you, Lord Pastry.

00:09:04.445 --> 00:09:05.980 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:09.383 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SQUALE] Might I ask, what kinds
of things does Lady Petra like?

00:09:09.518 --> 00:09:11.520 position:7% line:89% align:start
Flowers or food, for instance.

00:09:11.685 --> 00:09:14.321 position:16% line:83% align:start
Things Lady Petra likes?
Let me think.

00:09:14.455 --> 00:09:17.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've only met her once, however,
there must be something.

00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:19.160 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mmm.

00:09:19.794 --> 00:09:21.595 position:16% line:83% align:start
She does seem rather fond
of sweets.

00:09:21.729 --> 00:09:23.030 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sweets?

00:09:23.164 --> 00:09:24.832 position:30% line:83% align:start
I presented her
with some homemade cookies

00:09:24.965 --> 00:09:26.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
when we first met, and she
seemed overjoyed by them.

00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:28.402 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then would I be correct
in assuming

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:31.305 position:16% line:83% align:start
that you're quite skilled
at making sweet treats?

00:09:31.439 --> 00:09:33.641 position:16% line:89% align:start
I am! Better than anyone!

00:09:34.475 --> 00:09:35.943 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm never happier

00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:38.379 position:13% line:83% align:start
than when I'm whipping up
something sweet and tasty!

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.582 position:7% line:83% align:start
In fact, I recently made a pie
with bonkas

00:09:41.715 --> 00:09:42.917 position:10% line:83% align:start
I bought here in the capital
and...

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.086 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SQUALE] I'm sorry
but would you mind

00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:47.721 position:19% line:83% align:start
if we discuss your pie
another time?

00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:52.626 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh. [chuckles]
I got a bit carried away there.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.195 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm not sure quite
how to say this

00:09:54.328 --> 00:09:58.899 position:7% line:83% align:start
but, um, I have a favor to ask
of you, Lord Pastry!

00:09:59.033 --> 00:10:02.069 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd be glad to assist you
in any way that I can.

00:10:02.203 --> 00:10:04.905 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SQUALE] Good, because it's
something that only you can do!

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:07.241 position:24% line:83% align:start
You want me to make
special sweets?

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:10.978 position:24% line:83% align:start
Leave it all to me!
We'll start with...

00:10:11.112 --> 00:10:13.180 position:10% line:89% align:start
About Lady Petra's portrait.

00:10:13.314 --> 00:10:14.215 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:14.849 --> 00:10:16.450 position:13% line:89% align:start
Could you alter it for me?

00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:17.818 position:33% line:89% align:start
Alter it how?

00:10:18.452 --> 00:10:22.490 position:10% line:83% align:start
It could be, well a bit more
tantalizing, you know?

00:10:22.623 --> 00:10:24.258 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah?

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:26.961 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:29.063 position:21% line:83% align:start
[PAS] I suppose boys
are a bit gross

Let's go!

00:10:40.609 --> 00:10:42.743 position:10% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE] I'm happy to see
that distribution of food

00:10:42.877 --> 00:10:44.078 position:19% line:89% align:start
and firewood provisions

00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:46.380 position:24% line:83% align:start
among the citizens
is going smoothly.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.451 position:19% line:83% align:start
[FEUILLE] And it's all
on House Morteln's tab, correct?

00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:51.852 position:16% line:89% align:start
Did you really have to go

00:10:51.986 --> 00:10:53.787 position:16% line:83% align:start
and arrange for all this
by yourself, Boss?

00:10:53.921 --> 00:10:55.389 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you getting at?

00:10:55.524 --> 00:10:57.858 position:16% line:83% align:start
A lord so eager to enrich
the lives of his subjects

00:10:57.992 --> 00:10:59.393 position:5% line:89% align:start
he runs off to earn more money.

00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:02.196 position:19% line:83% align:start
Surely you must admit,
it's rather unheard of.

00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:04.865 position:10% line:83% align:start
I realize it's not especially
dignified

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:07.301 position:5% line:83% align:start
but I would hardly be fulfilling
my responsibilities

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:10.070 position:13% line:83% align:start
if I were to let my people
starve, now would I?

00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:12.806 position:33% line:83% align:start
Well, I guess
that indulgent side

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.342 position:30% line:83% align:start
is another part
of your ineffable charm.

00:11:15.476 --> 00:11:16.810 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm glad you feel that way,

00:11:16.944 --> 00:11:18.613 position:16% line:83% align:start
as I'll need you to work
that much harder

00:11:18.746 --> 00:11:19.947 position:21% line:89% align:start
to compensate for it.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.650 position:7% line:89% align:start
You know, it wouldn't kill you

00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:25.486 position:10% line:83% align:start
to show me a little taste of
indulgence every now and then.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.087 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are we indulging in?

00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:29.456 position:5% line:89% align:start
Some fresh-baked sweets, I hope?

00:11:29.591 --> 00:11:30.691 position:41% line:83% align:start

No chance.

00:11:40.868 --> 00:11:42.303 position:27% line:89% align:start
I see. Thank you.

00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:44.939 position:24% line:83% align:start
The first one comes
from Duke Kadlecek.

00:11:45.072 --> 00:11:48.475 position:24% line:83% align:start
And the second one
is from Margrave Hubarek.

Well, Pas, Feuille, rejoice.

00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:04.626 position:38% line:83% align:start
It seems
we're to receive a windfall.

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:06.894 position:10% line:89% align:start
Twenty thousand silver coins.

00:12:07.027 --> 00:12:08.395 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's amazing!

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.030 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow!

00:12:10.164 --> 00:12:11.533 position:7% line:83% align:start
Does this mean that Lord Squale
is officially engaged

00:12:11.666 --> 00:12:12.866 position:24% line:89% align:start
to Lady Petra then?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.502 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE]
Indeed.

00:12:14.636 --> 00:12:17.004 position:10% line:83% align:start
It appears they have decided
to announce it privately,

00:12:17.137 --> 00:12:19.940 position:30% line:83% align:start
on a happy day
that Lady Petra comes of age.

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:22.243 position:13% line:83% align:start
[PAS] Then it was worth it
spending all those hours

00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:24.713 position:16% line:83% align:start
on the matchmaking photo
after all!

00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:27.314 position:35% line:83% align:start
Even though
it was a huge hassle.

00:12:27.682 --> 00:12:30.619 position:5% line:83% align:start
It took two whole torturous days
to produce a picture

00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:32.753 position:7% line:89% align:start
that the margrave approved of!

00:12:37.157 --> 00:12:38.727 position:21% line:83% align:start
He intends to send us
an advance.

00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:40.894 position:21% line:83% align:start
We will soon receive
30 gold coins.

Why, how very generous of him!

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.600 position:10% line:83% align:start
Maybe you can build yourself
a grand estate!

What do ya say?

His letter is a request

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.811 position:35% line:83% align:start
She will be

and during her coming-of-age
announcement in the capital.

00:13:01.415 --> 00:13:02.316 position:35% line:89% align:start
Smart man.

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:03.984 position:27% line:83% align:start
There are plenty
of folks out there

00:13:04.118 --> 00:13:05.754 position:16% line:83% align:start
who would oppose the idea
of a marriage

00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:06.920 position:16% line:89% align:start
between those two houses.

00:13:07.054 --> 00:13:09.156 position:13% line:89% align:start
Utmost vigilance is a must.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.892 position:21% line:83% align:start
True. I don't suppose
the neighboring territory

00:13:12.026 --> 00:13:13.927 position:21% line:83% align:start
they're feuding with
will be too happy.

00:13:14.061 --> 00:13:15.195 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's a good thing
they're keeping

00:13:15.329 --> 00:13:16.964 position:30% line:83% align:start
the engagement
secret until then,

00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:19.500 position:30% line:83% align:start
let's just hope
it stays a secret.

00:13:19.634 --> 00:13:20.868 position:16% line:89% align:start
The Church knows, right?

00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:22.870 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Hm?

00:13:24.405 --> 00:13:25.707 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE]
Officially, the Church

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:27.776 position:5% line:89% align:start
is meant to be a neutral entity

00:13:27.908 --> 00:13:29.243 position:16% line:89% align:start
but a large enough bribe

00:13:29.376 --> 00:13:31.845 position:30% line:83% align:start
has been known
to loosen even their tongues.

00:13:32.246 --> 00:13:34.481 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everyone knows that
they're "officially" neutral.

00:13:34.616 --> 00:13:35.784 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's why they're able

00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:36.884 position:21% line:83% align:start
to collect all kinds
of information

00:13:37.017 --> 00:13:38.319 position:10% line:89% align:start
that's supposed to be secret.

00:13:38.452 --> 00:13:41.388 position:38% line:83% align:start
Aw, geez.
What a massive pain in the neck!

00:13:41.523 --> 00:13:44.391 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE] I can protect
Lady Petra herself well enough,

00:13:44.526 --> 00:13:47.227 position:5% line:83% align:start
since she will be under my watch
while we teleport.

[PAS]
It won't be easy.

00:13:49.063 --> 00:13:50.532 position:16% line:89% align:start
Looking after Lady Petra

00:13:50.665 --> 00:13:53.967 position:13% line:83% align:start
while also transporting her
retinue to the capital,

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:56.236 position:13% line:83% align:start
that could prove difficult
even for you.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.507 position:10% line:83% align:start
I could potentially teleport
Lady Petra alone to the capital

00:13:59.641 --> 00:14:01.108 position:13% line:89% align:start
to account for this danger,

00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:03.712 position:16% line:83% align:start
so long as we could have
security ready for her arrival.

00:14:03.844 --> 00:14:06.347 position:13% line:83% align:start

all that gold is for, huh?

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.149 position:19% line:83% align:start
It would be easy enough
to recruit aid in the capital,

00:14:09.283 --> 00:14:10.685 position:21% line:89% align:start
yet decidedly harder

00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:12.886 position:7% line:83% align:start
to prevent unsavory characters
from infiltrating.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:13.921 position:35% line:89% align:start
Fair point.

00:14:14.054 --> 00:14:15.790 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's not worth the hassle.

00:14:15.923 --> 00:14:17.024 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CASSEROLE]
We have no choice.

00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:18.526 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's my lordly responsibility

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.729 position:19% line:83% align:start
to secure the position
of our fiefdom

00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:22.096 position:5% line:89% align:start
and this will earn us the trust

00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:24.098 position:19% line:83% align:start
of two of the kingdom's
major players.

00:14:24.398 --> 00:14:27.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
To ensure the prosperity
of the Fief of Morteln,

00:14:27.468 --> 00:14:29.470 position:21% line:83% align:start
I will gladly accept
this challenge.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:34.375 position:7% line:83% align:start

just for the Fief of Morteln.

00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:35.643 position:24% line:89% align:start
We have to succeed

00:14:35.777 --> 00:14:39.213 position:27% line:83% align:start
to make my dream
of a land of sweets a reality.

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:42.950 position:16% line:83% align:start
Failure is not an option
for this all-important mission!

00:14:43.685 --> 00:14:46.019 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hm, but what about the risk

00:14:46.153 --> 00:14:48.355 position:21% line:83% align:start
of the Church leaking
information.

00:14:48.489 --> 00:14:49.724 position:35% line:89% align:start
The Church!

00:14:49.858 --> 00:14:51.358 position:44% line:89% align:start
Kid?

00:14:51.492 --> 00:14:52.893 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you have another thought
about the Church, do tell.

00:14:53.026 --> 00:14:54.294 position:30% line:83% align:start
I just thought
of the perfect place

00:14:54.428 --> 00:14:56.664 position:7% line:83% align:start
for us to keep Lady Petra safe
from harm!

00:14:56.798 --> 00:14:58.165 position:33% line:89% align:start
Where's that?

00:14:58.298 --> 00:15:00.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
A place with no windows
and only one entrance

00:15:00.502 --> 00:15:03.303 position:24% line:83% align:start
and it's surrounded
by thick walls on every side.

00:15:03.437 --> 00:15:06.574 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hm. The True Sanctification
ritual chamber!

00:15:06.708 --> 00:15:09.844 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, I'll be.
That's an incredible idea!

00:15:10.477 --> 00:15:11.979 position:44% line:83% align:start
[PAS]
She'll be going to the capital

00:15:12.112 --> 00:15:14.148 position:21% line:83% align:start
for her coming-of-age
announcement anyway.

00:15:14.281 --> 00:15:15.949 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's expected
that she'll undergo

00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:18.352 position:13% line:83% align:start
the Sanctification Ceremony
beforehand.

00:15:18.485 --> 00:15:21.255 position:24% line:83% align:start
We can tell people
that it's running a bit long.

00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:24.391 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then we can keep Lady Petra
locked away safely

00:15:24.526 --> 00:15:26.226 position:21% line:83% align:start
until the engagement
is announced!

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.495 position:7% line:83% align:start
"Locking her away" sounds a bit
too dramatic, though.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.799 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're just keeping her safe
from outsiders

00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:32.199 position:16% line:89% align:start
who seek to do her harm.

00:15:32.332 --> 00:15:33.568 position:24% line:89% align:start
It might just work.

00:15:33.701 --> 00:15:35.837 position:41% line:83% align:start
Agreed,
it's the best choice we have.

00:15:35.969 --> 00:15:38.640 position:10% line:83% align:start
All right! And since we won't
be hiring mercenaries,

00:15:38.773 --> 00:15:41.576 position:7% line:83% align:start
that means those 30 gold coins
are all ours!

One last thing,
I have a bill here
