Belgium here! Hello, everyone!

2
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,833
I sometimes get overshadowed
by my flashier neighbors.

3
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,208
But I assure you,
I am totally neat too!

00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,000
My waffles are world famous!

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,500
You should come by and try one.

00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,666
And we can watch
Jean-Claude Van Damme movies!

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,083
Tastes like merde.

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,250
My older brother Netherlands
is tall, handsome, and aloof!

9
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,333
Keep it in your pants, girls!

10
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,166
I cannot sell
it for less.

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,166
Your sales strategy
is unparalleled!

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,625
But if I had
to nit-pick,

13
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,416
I suppose I'd say my
brother's a bit stingy.

[NETHERLANDS] Yo! Lithuania.

Ah! Hello, Netherlands!

17
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,916
More cod and
herring, please.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,250
I'll pay with cash, of course.

19
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,208
You are always to buying
much fishes from me.

20
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,833
I am so grateful.

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,708
I never knew the Netherlands
had such tasting for the stuff!

22
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,458
Do not stick your nose
where it does not belong.

Uhh...

He buy big bunch
like this every days.

26

He will come back
tomorrow for more.

27

Every days?

But how does he keep
his place from smelling

29
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,541
like Red Light District?

30
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:51,625
Buy the fish cheap, use a dash
of salt, then pickle them.

31
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:54,708
Then sell them off
for a hefty profit.

32

'Cause cash is king.

The War of Devolution.

35
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:05,375
It involved the Spanish
Netherlands, not New Wave Music.

36
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,541
Ay! That went pretty poorly.

37
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,041
Netherlands is a lot
tougher than he looks.

38

He whipped it, whipped it good.

Pull it together,

I tell you,
it is no use.

Even if you combine
all the food and weapons

Lookin' for a fight,
you blonde bastard?

47
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,750
I'd be willing to part with
some food and some weapons,

48
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:31,708
for the right price.

Is that a joke?

We are at war
with each other!

51

Why burden yourself
with such technicalities

Que? Seriamente?

It's like he's nice and
a jerk at the same time, eh!
