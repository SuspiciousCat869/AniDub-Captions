[FEMALE NARRATOR]
Once upon a time.

2
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,791
Once upon a very different time.

3
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:24,333
Believe it or not, Russia
was the one being bullied.

4
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,791
Those mean old
kids from Mongolia

5
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,416
used to chase him around.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,875
And then, a rather
strange child joined them.

7
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,875
Hey asshat face,
you're going down!

8
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,875
[FEMALE NARRATOR] The Teutonic
Knights later became

9
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,833
the delight known as Prussia.

10
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,583
Back then, lonely Russia
thought the world would be

11
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:46,291
a better place if only Lithuania
would be friends with him.

12
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,833
Hey! I said stop; why
are you not stopping...

13
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't want to stop because
you are very not nice to me.

14
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,708
Not so fast, Russia boy!

15
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,416
Attack!

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,833
Denmark and Sweden?

17
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,541
You guys are trying to
get me just like they are?

18
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,791
I don't want to play.

19
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,333
Help me!

20
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,208
[FEMALE NARRATOR]
General Winter.

21
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:29,208
A fearsome general with a
killer jaw line who previously

22
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:32,583
overcame insane armies
that tried to invade Russia.

23
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:33,500
However...

24
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:34,875
[GENERAL WINTER] Laters!

25
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,416
[FEMALE NARRATOR] Though
General Winter brought down

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Napoleon and the Germans, he
wasn't effective on these guys

27
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,500
because they're used
to cold weather, too.

28
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:41,166
[GROUP] Huh?!

29
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,708
General Winter blows.

30
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,208
[KID RUSSIA] Ukraine!
Big sister!

31
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,958
Huh? Oh no, Russia,
what is wrong?

32
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,375
Besides obvious arrow?

33
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,208
Those meanies do
not listen to me.

34
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,583
Oh brother.

35
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,625
At times like this, why
don't you try using a spell?

36
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:00,750
What kind spell?

37
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,541
One that I do
all the time.

38
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,875
It's good for telling
people how you feel.

39
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,500
All you have to do is
show them your boobs.

40
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,375
All you have to do is
show them your boobs!

41
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,000
Why say that twice and
why so loud the last time?

42
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,583
Now I am embarrassed!

43
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,041
[FEMALE NARRATOR]
Nine times out of ten,

44
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,041
if it has to do with Ukraine,
there will be boobs.

45
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,958
What did I say?

46
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,375
[KID RUSSIA sighs]

47
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,541
[KID RUSSIA] I wish at
least I had one friend.

48
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,708
[KID RUSSIA] Do you happen
to be alone, like I am?

49
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,541
[KID RUSSIA]
Heh, heh! Come here!

50
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,541
Don't you want
to be friends?

51
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,583
[KID UKRAINE] I'm sorry,
he's in shock right now

52
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,791
what with being
rejected by a hamster.

53
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,041
Lame-o.

54
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,500
I see you!

55
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,666
I have got you, now!

56
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,083
Crap, Teutonic Knights!

57
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,166
Pledge your loyalty to
the Teutonic Knights,

58
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,083
although I am currently
shopping around for a new name!

59
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,375
[KID RUSSIA] You know, you
should consider the situation

60
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,291
more carefully before
you try to pick a fight.

61
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,666
[FEMALE NARRATOR]
In twelve forty-two,

62
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,791
on the mostly
frozen Lake Peipus,

63
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,333
Russian Troops and the Teutonic
Knights fought each other

64
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,958
in the "Battle on the Ice."

65
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,500
Looking around us,
we are both on the thin ice!

66
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,416
I don't care about that!

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,625
Eat my holy sword
with your butt!

68
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,125
Agh! Wait, your
sword's not that big.

69
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,625
[KID RUSSIA] No!
Please, stop the charging!

70
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,166
[yelling]

71
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:44,750
Wow. That was close.

72
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,625
[KID RUSSIA chuckles]

73
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,083
[KID RUSSIA]
Teutonic Knights;

74
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,250
I want you to listen to
me while you are choked.

75
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,833
Your impulses keep
getting the best of you.

76
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,833
I know you think it is awesome,

77
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,250
but I believe it will
be even more awesome

78
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,500
when those impulses
get the worst of you.

79
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,666
Right. I'm sorry, man.

80
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,375
[KID RUSSIA] I fought
the Teutonic Knights'

81
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,750
large army today.

82
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,500
It was hard fight for sure,
but we managed to win!

83
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,250
[KID PRUSSIA] I went to Russia
for some basic recon today,

84
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:18,000
when that crazy face attacked
us with his dirty tricks!

85
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,125
[KID RUSSIA] When Teutonic
Knights comes next time,

86
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,333
I hope he will come with
new name and also as friend.

87
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,083
[KID PRUSSIA]
Yeah, we lost a bit,

88
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,750
but it's too cold
there, you know?

89
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,333
I don't need Russia.

90
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,375
I don't need anyone;
I am awesome!
