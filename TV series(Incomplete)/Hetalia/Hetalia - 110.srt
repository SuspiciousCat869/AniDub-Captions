1
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,958
So, I will tell a story
about Nasreddin Hoca.

2
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:25,125
Now, clear out
your ears or else!

3
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,333
One day, someone
asked Mister Hoca,

4
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,208
"How long do we have
to keep repeating

5
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,333
this life and death thing?"

6
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:34,625
He replied, "Until
heaven and hell are full!"

7
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,250
Hope that will happen
later than sooner though!

8
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,416
[laughter]

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,041
But death is not
the end, friends.

10
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,125
Ah!

11
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,291
When your body ceases
to exist anymore,

12
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,375
is that when
death occurs?

13
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,041
If evidence you
existed disappears,

14
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,166
then would that not also mean
those who failed to leave...

15
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,625
Great, look.

16
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,083
Greece has slipped into his
philosophical mode again.

17
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,666
Go. Bring me sweet food, Egypt!

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,625
[KID EGYPT] Right.

19
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:00,666
[KID GREECE]
Want to pet cats.

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,583
Spoiler alert.
I want to pet cats.

21
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,541
Want to pet cats.
I want to pet kitties.

22
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,916
Hey, what's it
doing, Greece?

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,083
Are they hanging,
as it is said?

24
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:31,583
I don't know how to answer that,
so I'll say I guess so.

25
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,583
Do you not get my
hippity hop lingo?

26
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,208
[GREECE] Ehh...

27
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,083
Does that mean
you want fight?

28
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,916
I'm up for it if you are.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,083
Let's go.

30
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,666
Okay! We're gonna
brawl, mother trucker!

31
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,208
[FEMALE NARRATOR] One of
the few things these frenemies

32
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,958
have in common is a passion
for the power of dance.

33
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,750
I was just
practicing drums,

34
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,791
now these weirdoes won't
stop with the twerking.

35
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,041
[cat meows]

36
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,166
It's time for you to make
friends for real with Turkey,

37
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,166
and don't tell me no, Greece,

38
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,250
just find a way
to make it happen!

39
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,250
I'm trying.

40
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,083
Believe me, Cyprus.

41
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:16,583
The problem is I can't help
but punch him in the face.

42
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,166
My eyes, whenever I close them,

43
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,875
I see so many
Turkeys I get scared.

44
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,333
You see
multiple Turkeys?

45
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,250
That is what they
call a nightmare!

46
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,750
You've known each
other so long;

47
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,958
surely you've got some
good memories with him.

48
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,708
[GREECE] Uhh...

49
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,291
[TURKEY] Ha, ha! What the
junk are you talking about?

50
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,000
Come with me you
lazy dumb moron guy!

51
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,125
Uh... So hot.

52
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,458
[TURKEY laughs]

53
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,541
See, guy? Aren't you glad
you got naked with me?

54
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,666
How's it feeling?

55
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,000
Owie.

56
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,041
It's what they are calling
a "whole body scraping,"

57
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,166
and you're welcome!

58
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,666
Please don't do that
to my front side.

59
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,416
[TURKEY] No man alive
has the stiffy-ness

60
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,875
after this glorious attack!

61
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,166
[grunting]

62
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,416
Yeah, not stiff, just
numb; you can stop!

63
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,041
Is cool bro, I wash
you all the way to hell!

64
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,708
Meet the madly
dancing scrubber move!

65
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,791
I suppose taking a bath
with him was pretty fun.

66
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,916
Wait, I thought you
only took baths with me!

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,833
[cat meows]

68
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,250
[FEMALE NARRATOR] According to
the Internet, the Galata Bridge

69
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:21,291
is a "great place to grab a
bite and watch the locals."

70
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,458
Germany!

71
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,125
Smile for the camera!

72
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,500
Nein. My face is perfect
just the way it is.

73
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,166
Ha! Yoink!

74
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,750
--Hey!
--Achtung!

75
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,708
[FEMALE NARRATOR] Reviews also
say watch out for pickpockets.

76
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,750
Apparently, they're a lot
stronger and faster

77
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,750
than they look, so they
can be difficult to catch.

78
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,000
Look, it is thief!

79
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:36,833
[TURKEY] Uh!

80
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,333
You bad man!

81
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,166
Picking the pocket
in broad daylight?

82
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,583
What the kebab are you thinking?

83
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,750
Pulling stunts like that

84
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,833
will keep these suckers
from visiting me!

85
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:46,916
[FEMALE NARRATOR]
Good thing Turkey ain't

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000

than I thought!

00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:50,791
Oh yeah.

00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,916
Turkey is the
strongest ever!

00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,333
[ITALY] Ciao Turkey!

Thank you for
catching that guy!

Tante grazie!

I just want you to
be able to rest easy

and enjoy the splendor
and radness of my home.

Go figure, man.

00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,541
I can't believe how you
have the mellow now, Italy.

Tee-hee.

100
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,666
That's right; I did a lot
of crazy things, huh?

101
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,708
Wait.
Italy did what?

102
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:15,708
Yeah.

103
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,708
I made the mistake
of bullying him.

104
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,416
He kicked the baklava out of me.

105
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,041
Wait.
Italy did what?

106
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,250
I still can't believe you
took me down all by yourself.

107
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,250
I thought for sure,
you were a demon.

108
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,208
Wait! Italy did what?
