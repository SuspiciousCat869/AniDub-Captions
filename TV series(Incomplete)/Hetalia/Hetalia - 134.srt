1
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,458
[CANADA]
Hello, I'm Canada.

2
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:20,708
[VOICE]
Canadaan.

3
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,750
[CANADA] People often
mistake me for America.

4
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,333
But they also say
that he and I have

5
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,958
very different personalities.

6
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,250
This is Mister Kumandengakuro.

7
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,208
He's my conversation
partner and good friend.

8
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,333
Who are you?

9
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,250
[CANADA]
He never remembers my name.

10
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,625
We've been friends
for a long time, too.

11
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,125
Who are you?

12
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,666
[BOTH]
Hetalia.

13
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,375
[CANADA] My neighbor's
kinda really noisy,

14
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:46,625
--[AMERICA] Neighbor!
--but my place is

15
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,041
nice and quiet.

16
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,291
[AMERICA screams]

17
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,875
[CANADA] Yeah, he's more
than kinda really noisy.

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,833
Canada, my man!

19
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,750
Oh, hello there, America.

20
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,000
Don't you think
you're overdoing it

21
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,916
with all the maple stuff, dude?

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,916
What? I enjoy maple stuff.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,916
[KUMAJIRO]
Hm.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,083
[NARRATOR]
Mister Canada's house is

25
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,416
ridiculously full of
maple-themed items.

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,958
What's weird is he
actually likes it.

27
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,708
Give me your fur! Do it, France.

28
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,083
Do it now or else! Give it!

29
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,666
I am trying to get past you,
so get out of my way!

30
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,000
[BOTH grunting]

31
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,833
[NARRATOR]
Mister France and Mister Britain

32
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,333
have always acted like
children with each other.

33
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,208
They fought in many
different places.

34
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,583
[BOTH growl]

35
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,583
[NARRATOR] And that includes
Mister Canada's house.

36
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,833
I'm gonna defeat Britain and

37
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,875
make you my little brother
for sure, okay, Canada?

38
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,083
[CANADA]
Yeah, okay.

39
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,666
But we're completely
surrounded right now,

40
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,666
how can you be positive
we're gonna be safe?

41
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,916
[FRANCE]
I never said we'd be safe.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,125
However, I won't give up

43
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,750
no matter how many
decades it takes!

44
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,958
Aw, thank you for caring.

45
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,916
The point is, I don't
know what's going on.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,375
The local militia's
fighting style is offensive.

47
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:11,166
It lacks fashion, as if
they're not even European.

48
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,916
[FRANCE]
Then, why don't we change it?

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,083
Let's give them something
with a little more flair!

50
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,750
Of course, undoubtedly our
lives should come first, though.

51
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,166
[NARRATOR]
It's said that the fight

52
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,500
between Mister Britain and
Mister France over Canada

53
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,541
ended in half of an entire hour.

54
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,833
That was scary!

55
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,125
--[CANADA] Hetalia.
--[KUMAJIRO] Who are you?

56
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,750
I wonder why people keep saying
that I don't really stand out.

57
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,916
You know, I think my maple
syrup is pretty great, eh?

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,500
I remember when I used to
be pampered by everyone.

59
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,166
That was so nice...

60
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,958
Oh Canada, I can introduce
you to your brother today,

61
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,166
if you would like?

62
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,583
So, um, what kind of
person is my brother?

63
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,166
Well, let's see...

64
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,916
He is a bit mischievous, but I
think you'll like him all right.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,375
[CANADA]
My brother.

66
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,666
I hope I can get along with him.

67
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,291
[BRITAIN] Hey, America!
Come over here for a bit!

68
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,250
Why? What do you
want me over there for?

69
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,041
[CANADA gasps]

70
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,500
Huh?

71
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,791
Wow. I can't believe that
we both have the same face!

72
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:04,916
[AMERICA laughing]

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,666
Nice to meet you. I'm Cana--

74
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,833
Boring.

75
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,916
Uh... Did you know
that you're my brother?

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,625
[AMERICA]
Britain! I'm hungry!

77
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,666
Stick some food in my face hole!

78
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,833
[CANADA]
Never mind.

79
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,583
I guess it's been like
this my whole life...

80
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,958
[BOTH]
Hetalia!

81
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,833
[CANADA] I was hoping I
could have lunch with him,

82
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,500
but it looks like
he's kinda busy.

83
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,958
--[KUMAJIRO] Hey!
--[CANADA gasps]

84
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,500
[KUMAJIRO] Are you positive
you wanna back down here?

85
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,041
[CANADA]
Huh?

86
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,208
You didn't ask.

87
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,750
But I'm just saying
it's not always best

88
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,250
to take the passive route.

89
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,166
It's okay to speak up
and seek attention, eh.

90
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,291
Yeah, that makes sense.
I'm gonna try to speak to him!

91
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,291
[AMERICA laughing]

92
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,125
It's... lunchtime?

93
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,625
Lunch! Lunch! Lunch! Lunch!

94
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:56,416
All right, you both want lunch.
I've got it, now, shut up!

95
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,416
[BOTH]
Hetalia!

96
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,666
[NARRATOR] The Internet is
popular in Mexico, tambien.

97
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,250
Hey, you.

98
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,916
Yep? What is it,
Mister Kumasaburo?

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,791
[KUMAJIRO] Mexico is calling
for ideas to be submitted online

100
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,708
on how to help them make a
better overall impression.

101
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,875
I emailed them and said

102
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,625
they should put Canada
in their country.

103
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:15,666
What? Why me?

104
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,375
A reindeer!

105
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,625
How weird.

106
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,958
Quiero hot milk suddenly
for some unknown reason.

107
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,166
Quiero ver la puesta de sol.

108
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,583
And I wanna play in the snow.

109
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,708
[NARRATOR] It seems Canada
is a symbol of happiness.

110
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,625
They do have a pretty
hot prime minister.

111
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,541
I don't think it'll
be like that.
