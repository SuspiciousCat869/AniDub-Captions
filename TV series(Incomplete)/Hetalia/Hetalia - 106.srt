[CHIBI ROMANO]
My name is Romano.

00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,708
A jerk bastard named Spain
forced me to be his henchman,

3
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:26,333
working morning and night
because he is a jerk bastard!

Ay! Buenos días, Romano!

Buenos nothing;
I'm starving!

[CHIBI ROMANO]
This food is total crapola.

10
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,375
I'm still hungry,
you bastard jerk!

11
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,416
[SPAIN] Okay!

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,708
[CHIBI ROMANO] Stupid squirrels
always mess up my room.

13
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:06,000
Ay! I thought I would go
ahead and clean your room up.

14
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,625
Make sure it's spick
and span this time, eh!

[CHIBI ROMANO yawns]

00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,958
Romano, I aired your
covers out for you.

17
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,208
Shut your face!
And buonanotte, jerk!

What a refreshing
sleepytime that was!

00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,416
Wow, it's been a while
since I wasn't woken up

with un head butt de Romano.

[SPAIN]
¡Romano! ¡Qué malo!

[CHIBI ROMANO] It wasn't me!

29
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,916
You wet the bed
again last night?

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,125
No, I did not!

31
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,750
A squirrel snuck into my bed

and pee-peed all
over it, you jerkface!

Don't listen to
that bastard!

37
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,958
What we need is a pill that
will keep squirrels from

Damn it, I am starting
to get hungry.

There are some
fruits in that basket.

So tell me.

Doesn't all of this work make
a jerk bastard like you crazy?

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,958
Well, I'm the boss, so I'm
used to handling this stuff.

51
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,916
Besides, I try to take
a siesta every day.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,125
I think in consideration of
all this work you like to do.

I'll allow you to be
my exclusive servant

are-a here?

You can wait a bit, right?

Romano! What are you doing?

70
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,708
Don't worry, Spain!
I will hold them back.

Now hurry up and
run away already!

Romano, you've got
some 'splaining to do.

77
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,416
He is a guest of mine,
and you know it's not

78
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,125
appropriate to be
rude to my guests.

79

If you'd rather be friends
with those stupid Germans,

Ay, that was
not very nice!

What is going on with him?

Maybe it's me.

Maybe I made a mistake spoiling
the little cabrón like I did.

I swear I have seen
a kindness in him.

At first, I just thought
he was an awful brat.

Romano.

92
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,250
Tell me why you attacked
him like that, come on.

Tell me why you won't
shut up, you jerk!

94
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,208
I saw you with
those soldiers,

95
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,041
and I thought that you might
be in some trouble. Eh?

96
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,666
But then you had to go and
yell at me in front of everyone

97
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,083
like I was misbehaving.

98
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,250
That really pissed
me off like big time!

99
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,041
[SPAIN] He looks
like a little tomato.

at, you jerk bastard?
