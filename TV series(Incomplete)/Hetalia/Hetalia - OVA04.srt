How fun.

00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,166
This isn't too bad.

[FEMALE NARRATOR]
This story takes place

00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,958
before the events
of Uncann--

7
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,875
before Liechtenstein
cut her hair.

00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,583
[knocking]

00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,666
You awake? I've come
to say good morning.

10
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,000
[LIECHTENSTEIN] Yes, I'm awake.

11
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,500
Are you feeling well
now? Or still sickly?

12
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,583
Oh, yes, I'm doing
so much better.

13
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank you for asking!

14
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,375
[GROUP] Idiots.

15
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,541
[SWITZERLAND] Well, since
those idiots are starting to

16
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,750
make a fuss again,
I'm off to keep watch.

17
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,250
Can you watch
the house?

18
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,500
Of course, and
please be careful!

19
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,250
He's always surrounded
by such great powers.

20
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,750
Yet somehow, he's managed
to keep his independence

21
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:30,958
for hundreds of years.

22
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,291
[SWITZERLAND] How fun.

23
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,666
[LIECHTENSTEIN] I mean,
he's barely five foot six.

24
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,916
It makes me wonder how
he's been able to do it.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
[SWITZERLAND laughs]

26
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,000
How fun.

[SWITZERLAND laughs]

28
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,375
Strong weapons,
yes, of course!

29
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:47,041
I should have guessed that!

30
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,666
Okay. He has these
strong weapons,

31
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,291
so he shouldn't
have to fight alone.

32
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,291
I'm sure I can find something
to use that will help him out!

[SWITZERLAND] How fun.

36
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,583
Turning those jerks away
is too much damn work.

37
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,333
What's the matter?
You look a bit pale.

38
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,833
Liechtenstein.

39
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,166
I need to talk to
you about something.

40
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,333
You have not
great equipment.

41
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,666
And it makes me very
concerned for you.

42
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,166
It is a
hodgepodge. Ahem.

43
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,416
And yes, they may be old
and about as reliable as--

44
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,666
I don't do metaphors.

45
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,916
But geography makes
it hard to attack.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,666
And I have good
gun technology.

47
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,500
Oh, what
a relief.

48
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,208
Weapons! Look,
these are my guns.

49
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,208
As you can see, I have plenty,
so there's no need to worry.

50
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,666
Impressive; I feel
so much better!

51
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,250
Switzerland! Sell me many
weapons, and danke schoen!

52
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,958
How fun; here,
take these.

53
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,583
Wait, you're
going to sell them?

[LIECHTENSTEIN]
Why would you do that?

56
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,541
[SWITZERLAND] How fun!

57
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,250
How fun. How fun?

Oh, I think
I get it now!

61
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,625
[GERMANY] Sorry, Switzerland.

62
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,791
I just can't find the
time to get out of here

63
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,583
so I can pick up those weapons.

64
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:19,250
I don't mind delivering whatever
you want as long as you pay.

65

[SWITZERLAND] Oh great.

66
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,250
Deliver weapons to Germany?

67
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,500
Guess I have no choice, though.

00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,416
Huh?!

69
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,250
Aw bummer, dude, I totally
dropped that wrench on accident.

70
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,250
Certainly weren't aiming at
that cargo meant for Germany.

always super jerks?

00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,041
Don't tell me
you still prefer

75
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,625
not to work together
with the good guys?

76
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,125
Fine, I won't
tell you that.

77
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,375
Now, go away.

78
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,333
I've got better things
to do than listen to you.

By which of course I mean you
stick to one principle only.

82
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,166
I personally wish you'd relax
a bit, but, for your sake,

83
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,291
you should try to cozy up with
us at least a little while.

that with you jerks!

fine by myself,

isn't all that cozy.
