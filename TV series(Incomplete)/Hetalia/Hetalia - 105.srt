1
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:23,416
Did I ever tell you I used to
work in Paris a long time ago?

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,041
One day, I actually
got to meet France.

3
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,875
But France is
the whole country.

4
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,041
[GRANDFATHER 5A] That and more.

5
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,083
Here, he's standing next to me.

6
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,875
I can't believe I
was ever so young.

7
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,750
[BOY MAIN CHARACTER 5A]
He looks like a regular guy.

8
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:35,750
[GRANDFATHER 5A] Oui.

9
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,125
But looks, they
can be deceiving.

10
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,208
[BOSS 5A] Wake up!

11
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,750
Hey!

12
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,041
Oh! Crap, I fell asleep!

13
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,791
Apologies, sir!

14
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,541
[BOSS 5A] That work
attitude of yours

15
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:11,208
may not be a problem in Gordes,
but it will not help you here.

16
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,041
I was dreaming about
my grandfather.

17
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,458
He used to show me these
pictures from when he was

18
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,416
around my age and
worked in Paris, too.

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,625
He even showed me this photo
he took with France once.

20
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:24,458
Hm? Ah, oui. You're
new to Gay Paris.

21
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,416
He's there.
You cannot miss him.

22
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,083
[MAIN CHARACTER 5A] Huh?!

23
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,500
That's the same man
from the picture!

24
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,541
You've never seen
him in person before?

25
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,750
It doesn't make sense;
he looks the same.

26
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:47,000
Mon dieu! Where are you going?

27
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,125
[FRANCE] Hmm?

28
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,458
Sir. I must know
what you really are.

29
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,375
You and my grandfather
took a picture together

30
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,875
when he was
a young man,

31
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,708
and I'm having a hard time
understanding how you can look

32
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,458
exactly the same as you
did in that picture!

33
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:06,791
I mean, most people age at least
a little after fifty years.

34
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,541
Oh oui! Tell your
grandpa I said bonjour.

35
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,041
You remember?

36
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,000
Think of me as a ship, no?

37
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,333
[MAIN CHARACTER 5A] Quoi?

38
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,791
The government is the sails,
the people the wind,

39
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,708
and think of time as the sea.

40
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,333
If the sails they are unfurled,
and the wind is good,

41
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,416
the ship moves
forward très bien.

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,375
Of course, it could
always crash on the rocks

43
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,125
or sink like a stone, too.

44
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,000
So you know,
something like this.

45
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,208
[MAIN CHARACTER 5A]
Honestly, M'sieur.

46
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,916
I don't know what
any of that meant.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,541
As long as there
are people who love

48
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,416
and take care of the ship,
it can last forever.

49
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,791
[MAIN CHARACTER 5A] Umm...

50
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,916
[BOSS 5A] Do you understand
his point now, garçon?

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,583
If so, fill me in.
I do not get that guy.

52
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,208
[MAIN CHARACTER 5A] So, Paris,
as they say, is a mystery.

53
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,500
[MAIN CHARACTER WIFE 5A]
You really saw him?

54
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,083
You've seen
the picture, oui?

55
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,125
He hasn't aged at all.

56
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,000
It was surreal.

57
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,500
And not fair, you know?

58
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,458
We only get such a short amount
of time to be at our best.

59
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,833
But France stays young forever.

60
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,041
Total crap,
am I right?

61
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,958
Is that what you want?

62
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,583
To live forever?

63
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,000
Um.

64
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:15,833
[MAIN CHARACTER WIFE 5A]
Your time will flow differently

65
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,250
than everyone you know.

66
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,000
We came to Paris
together, didn't we?

67
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,666
We found jobs and
built a home together.

68
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,250
We'll have children, and we will
watch them grow up together.

69
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,500
But I will grow
old without you.

70
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,958
One day, you will
hardly recognize me.

71
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,625
And then, I will be gone.

72
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,458
How many others will
you have to watch die?

73
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,333
Can you imagine that?

74
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:43,250
What human is strong enough
to bear that kind of burden?

75
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,208
You may find
another to love,

76
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,250
but eventually, you'll
end up alone, again.

77
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,875
Your existence
would be so lonely.

78
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,125
I want more
for you than that.

79
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,500
So much more.

80
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,958
If you lived forever,
it would break my heart.

81
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,625
Perhaps being together is
better than that dream.

82
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,500
[MAIN CHARACTER 5A] It is.

83
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,291
Besides, the only
dream I've ever had

84
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,583
is to grow old with you.

85
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,291
[MAIN CHARACTER 5A] And no
matter how wrinkled we may get,

86
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,041
at least we'll always
have each other.

87
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,041
You are my forever.

88
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,000
[FRANCE] Hm...

89
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,000
[FRANCE laughs]
