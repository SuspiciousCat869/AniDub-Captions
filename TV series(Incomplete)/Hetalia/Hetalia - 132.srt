1
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:17,916
[FRANCE sighs]
Allez!

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,166
I'm about to quit
waiting for you.

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,916
Ah, bonjour, friends.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,333
C'est moi, France,
the one we all love!

5
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,083
I'm certain you already know who
I am, but I wanted to assure you

6
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,583
I will continue to bring
beauté to the world!

7
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,916
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,750
that I announce I will be the
main character from now on.

9
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,875
No more filthy eyebrows
and crude food

10
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,666
for life will be magnifique.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,791
Shut it! No magnifiquing here!

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,833
Boo.

13
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,416
[FRANCE]
Even if you somehow defeat me,

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,000
my second and third selves
will attack your quadriceps!

15
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,000
[GERMANY]
Uh?

16
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,583
In France, there
is a law that says

17
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,458
you cannot name a pig Napoleon.

18
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:08,875
Isn't that amusing?

19
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,041
[PIG] It's extra funny because
pigs are smart, oink.

20
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,125
They understand a lot of
what humans are saying,

21
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:16,666
and they can even operate
simple devices, oink oink!

22
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,125
[FRANCE]
Hetalia.

23
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,500
[FRANCE sighs]
My reflection on the Seine River

24
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,958
is even more beautiful today.

25
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,208
[PIERRE coos]

26
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,666
Oh no, Mister France!
We've got a big problem!

27
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,583
Germany is already approaching
very close to the border.

28
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:32,250
What'll we do?

29
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,583
What? Germany is?

30
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,916
That brawny ox sure doesn't
waste time, does he?

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
Oh, there he is! I can
see him headed towards me.

32
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,333
Oh no, je suis dans la merde!

33
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,458
Come back later, no one is home!

34
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,125
Un moment, Germany!

35
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:47,708
You are too late, I've already
constructed the Maginot Line!

36
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,500
--[VOICE A] Maginot.
--[GERMANY] Hm?

37
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:50,833
[FRANCE]
You cannot cross this line

38
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,541
for that is against the rules!

39
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,708
[VOICE B]
Maginot!

40
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:55,791
[GERMANY]
Marsch, marsch, marsch...

41
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,208
[FRANCE screams]

42
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,958
I never imagined
he would come here

43
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,916
through the Ardennes Forest.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,125
What a nightmare.

45
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,416
[BRITAIN] All right,
chin up, there, stubble.

46
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,208
Now that France is over himself,
we can resume the meeting,

47
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,500
discussing, of course,
the Axis Powers and

48
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,708
how to stop and/or destroy them.

49
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:16,250
I did defeat Italy, so you
are all welcome for that.

50
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,541
No one thinks you're badass.

51
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:18,875
[FRANCE]
They don't?

52
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,541
Aw, what must they think
of you then after getting

53
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,541
pretty much knocked out
by Italy the other day?

54
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,250
Oh, just shut it, frog face.

55
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,875
Look, are you seriously daft?

56
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,791
If you keep arguing with me the
meeting cannot move forward!

57
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,750
[FRANCE] But your reactions are
so much fun to watch, mon ami.

58
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,958
Britain, I want to discuss
an important matter with you.

59
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,291
What is it?

60
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,416
You may not know, but I
was very busy last night.

61
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,000
Your point?

62
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,583
My point is I'm shutting down
for the day since I'm sleepy.

63
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,250
No, don't go on strike!

64
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,125
[FRANCE]
Here we go!

65
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,125
Magi-Magi Magical Strike!

66
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,541
Now that it's come down to this,

67
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,916
I'll use my right to go on
strike like I usually do!

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

69
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,541
What's up with that
ridiculous ensemble?!

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,208
In Britain, after
a certain incident

71
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,416
that shall not be named,
they created a law prohibiting

72
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,958
mail carriers from making any
eye contact with dogs, woof.

73
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,791
Magi-Magi Magical Stri--

74
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,041
Will you stop wearing that?!

75
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,625
You're trivializing
people's feelings

76
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,416
and making me very
uncomfortable.

77
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,166
Here, I came all this way,

78
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,750
but I can't go inside
because of strike.

79
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,375
Britain, your jacket is
so twenty years ago.

80
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,375
Oh, let me design
a new one for you.

81
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,750
Forget about me.
You should stop dressing like

82
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,541
you need attention
from everyone!

83
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,291
Hold it! You're just
disagreeing with me

84
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,958
for the sake of
disagreeing with me!

85
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,166
But your face makes
me disagreeable.

86
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,791
[AMERICA]
Dude, meetings go nowhere

87
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,916
when you guys are involved.

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,125
Complain to this stubble

89
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,125
who gets off by making
fun of my fashion!

90
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,625
Stop!

91
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,208
How dare you pull on my noble
stubble, you damn bastard?

92
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,333
[AMERICA laughs]

93
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,916
What are you laughing at?!

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,583
You crazy kids always talk at
each other not to each other.

95
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,583
Don't you know that's
bad form, dude?

96
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,000
--[FRANCE] Oh.
--[BRITAIN] Hm.

97
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,541
Let's take a sec to listen
to each side, and then...

98
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,708
...I can judge whose
opinion is most like mine,

99
00:03:58,791 --> 00:03:59,833
and therefore better!

100
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,458
You don't have the
right to do that!

101
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,208
You're such a frightening child.

102
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,333
--[FRANCE chuckles]
--[BRITAIN grunts]

103
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,916
[MONACO gasps]
Mm!

104
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,416
So yummy! I knew you were a good
cook, but I did not expect this!

105
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,416
Feel free to continue
praising me.

106
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,666
I took out the smellies.
And the dirties.

107
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,916
I wanted to make sure it
was clean and delicious.

108
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,833
[MONACO]
Well, it is amazing!

109
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,375
But there's someone
even more amazing

110
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,666
when it comes to escargots!

111
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,291
What? Who is amazing?

112
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,125
[MONACO] I think we should
have a day to celebrate

113
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,625
the first person who thought,
"that snail looks good,"

114
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,625
and ate it so that the
rest of us could know.

115
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,541
[FRANCE] I honestly
don't know what to say.
