1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,291
We got together to have
a horror movie screening,

2
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,541
and I peed my pants.

3
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,166
[BRITAIN] Are we all ready?

4
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,833
I borrowed one of India's
recent horror films.

5
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,083
Namaste.

6
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,791
I feel like I should
be able to guess

7
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,583
what one of those films
would be like, but no clue.

8
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:48,458
Hm?

9
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,125
[INDIAN MAN 18B yells]

10
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,166
Oh no! What have you done?

11
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:01,625
This story is about a knight
who died after being betrayed.

12
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,625
Then his soul came back so he
could slaughter the bad guys?

13
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,333
Germany!
I'm so scared!

14
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,416
Yeah.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,583
Gotta say bros,
that does look freaky.

16
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,958
[INDIAN MAN 18A] Oh...

17
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:21,458
[INDIAN MEN] Hah!

18
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:26,458
[chanting]

19
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,750
[BRITAIN] Are they dancing?

20
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,250
That's not scary!

21
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,208
What kind of murderous
ghost does a dance number

22
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,541
with those responsible
for his death?

23
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,166
Just what I'd expect!

24
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,458
India always makes everything
we suck at look like it's easy.

25
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,083
It makes me right happy
knowing more people

26
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,666
are watching our horror
movies these days, eh?

27
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,625
Who are you?

28
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,041
I'm Canada.

29
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,958
Wait a minute; y'sayin'
this is a Canadian flick?

30
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,125
Figured it was from Hollywood.

31
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,375
Hang in there.

32
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,458
No, it's all right.
I'm kinda used to it.

33
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,875
[FRANCE] I understand.

34
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,083
Please know at least
one of us appreciates

35
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,541
the charm of your movies.

36
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,166
You mean it, France?

37
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,791
The setups of your cinematic
works are so elaborate.

38
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,291
[FRANCE] Oui, they
are très élaborer.

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,125
Exceptionnellement élaborer.

40
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,291
And, in the end.

41
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,666
They throw it all away!

42
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,416
Uh, yeah. I guess so.

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,333
That sounds
well good to me!

44
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,416
[ITALY whimpers]

45
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,375
[JAPAN] What is
the matter?

46
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,875
[ITALY] In that
British horror film,

47
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:43,416
the main character
died at the very end!

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,000
Why are you such a strange,
twisted little creature?

49
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,708
You must be so lonely.

50
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,708
Germany made that
movie with me!

51
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,333
Blame him. Gah!

52
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,625
Oh, then let's watch
the one Germany brought!

53
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,250
Hey, girl! Oooh!

54
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,333
[AMERICA laughs]

55
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,791
All the boobs and stereotypical
gay guy throw me off.

56
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,333
[AMERICA laughs]

57
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,875
Fair.

58
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,375
Make boobs,
not gore!

59
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,208
[RUSSIAN MAN 18A screams]

60
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,333
[RUSSIAN MAN 18B] I see shadow!

61
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,166
Where is this
one from?

62
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,208
[ITALY] It's stressing me out!

63
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,375
[RUSSIA] Oh, sorry.

64
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,500
Is just video I made
at home, though.

65
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,291
My bad; wrong one.

66
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,416
[ITALY yells]

67
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,625
[RUSSIA chuckles]

68
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,708
[AMERICA] You know.

69
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,375
After seeing what
they make, dude,

70
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,666
I don't think my horror
movies are all that weird.

71
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,500
I hate to say this,
but I agree.

72
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,541
We got some real
freaks out there.

73
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:50,708
[ITALY mutters]

74
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,541
[JAPAN] Sleep well.

75
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:56,291
Now is time, I believe, to watch
one of America's scary film.

76
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,250
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

77
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,833
Rock out! Hah!

78
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,791
[AMERICA roars]

79
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,041
Zombies!

80
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,416
There's no
way to get out!

81
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,750
[AMERICAN MAN 18A gasps]

82
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,166
Who are you?

83
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,833
Heh. I'm just an
ordinary cook.

84
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,500
Yeah...

85
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,041
Buddy...

86
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,208
[GROUP] Definitely weird!

87
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,375
See?

88
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,708
Jealous, huh?

89
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,416
[FRANCE sighs]
