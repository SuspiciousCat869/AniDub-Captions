1
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,875
Japan. You look much
more serious than usual.

2
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:25,666
I am.

3
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,916
It is from this new game.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,083
The main character's
company is failing

5
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,625
because his irresponsible
friends hid their debt.

6
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,958
You must save the company,
and your honor.

7
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,500
But the amount your company
owes is prohibitive,

8
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,458
and your so-called
friends betray you,

9
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,500
so all roads lead to seppuku.

10
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,666
This fantasy
sounds quite final!

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,000
Trouble is, nobody has ever
successfully beaten this game.

12
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,041
Perhaps you will be
the one, Germany.

13
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,416
You think so?

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,708
I guess it couldn't
hurt to give it a try.

15
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,333
[game sounds]

16
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,208
[GERMANY] What is this scheisse?

17
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,083
You can't do a damn
thing in this game

18
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,375
without buying the DLC!

19
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,958
Just skip to the
quick-time disembowelment.

20
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,125
[GREECE] Hey, Japan. Hey.

21
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:08,541
Somebody needs a widdle
belly-wub, Japan,

22
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:12,125
and this cat would
probably like one, too.

23
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,708
[SEALAND] Hm?

24
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,083
The Principality of Wy
was founded in Australia?

25
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:39,125
Finally, another country that's
even more of a noob than I am!

26
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,416
[SEALAND]
Don't fret, Wy!

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,625
As the former new kid
on the block myself,

28
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:47,166
I consider it my duty
to show you the ropes!

29
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,333
Micro-nations
for the win!

30
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,958
Why're you lumping
the two of us together?

31
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,458
Uh, 'cause
we're so alike?

32
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,208
Look, I know
we're both small.

33
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,041
--but that is all we
have in common, okay?

34
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,375
Hmph. I'm in the books
all official-like!

35
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:02,875
[SEALAND] Uh...

36
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,125
Strange news from Australia.

37
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000
A family has declared
its nationhood

38
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,833
after a fight over a driveway!

39
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:10,625
Huh?

40
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:11,750
If there is new addition,

41
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,500
I betting Sealand
is pestering them!

42
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,666
He can be such
little spaz boy!

43
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,583
I need reining him in
before he does stupid thing!

44
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,166
[phone rings]

45
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,250
Hey, uh, Sealand?
You are being good?

46
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,375
[SEALAND and WY laugh]

47
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,250
[LATVIA] Oh! So,
you are get along?

48
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,541
That is greatly news, you two!

49
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,000
[SEALAND and WY]
Ahh! Upside-down...

50
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,125
[LATVIA] Wait, what you
are talking about?

51
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,833
Did you say "upside-down
dead guy in tree?"

52
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,458
[SEBORGA] Ciao--it's a
pleasure to meet you!

53
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,750
My name is Seborga!

54
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:41,375
I was Italian, back before
I became my own man.

55
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:45,083
Ay-yi-yi, that's enough freaking
out over me for one day.

56
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,708
This is a red sauce, and hanging
like this is molto relaxing!

57
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,958
You're disrespecting the
sovereignty of my tree, mister!

58
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,791
And that's a massive
waste of tomatoes!

59
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,625
You're Wy, is
that right?

60
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:59,208
Ah. I may have to look you up
when you're a little older, eh?

61
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,375
You always wanna put your best
thumb forward, as they say.

62
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,083
You know--I didn't wanna
get stuck in this tree.

63
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,416
But these are the
sort of crazy hi-jinks

64
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,458
we micro-nations get up to, no?

65
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,041
I dunno--people
show me respect.

66
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,750
What's the big idea,
scaring us like that?

67
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,916
I mean it! You frightened
us half to death, you dummy!

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,125
How'd you think we
were gonna react...

69
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,500
[WY] I wonder.

70
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,458
Will people lump me together
with these knuckleheads

71
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,291
just because I'm new?

72
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,083
Wow!

73
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,250
That folk costume you're
wearing is so pretty, Ukraine!

74
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,375
I like yours!

75
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,791
This one is a little too loose!

76
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,083
See?

77
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,833
Maybe they're
old-fashioned,

78
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,500
but you find some very
interesting clothes

79
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,500
when you go digging
through history.

80
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,875
"Interesting?"

81
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,208
How exactly do you
mean, Hungary?

82
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,833
Like this
colorful one!

83
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,208
Wow!
He's a rainbow!

84
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,541
And some European men wore
their swords like this!

85
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,125
I, uh, cannot look!

86
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,708
How he does
not trip over it?

87
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,375
And then there's this fellow
with his cute little hood!

88
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,833
Aw, he's just
adorable!

89
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,708
Go ninja,
go ninja Pole!

90
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,500
Ruffs like this were
popular a long time ago,

91
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,833
but they would have been a
bother in day-to-day life.

92
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,958
Is that so he does not
lick his stitches?

93
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:08,958
And now!

94
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,583
The very best of the bunch!

95
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,000
[CRETAN WOMAN 19A] Omorfi Kriti!

96
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,291
Why are they out?

97
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,375
Go on! I think it
would suit you!

98
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,875
But they'd see
my Carpathians!

99
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,708
[LIECHTENSTEIN] So, the
ladies of Crete wore stuff

100
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,666
that made spectacles
of their breastacles?

101
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,041
Honestly, it's a wonder the
men ever got anything done.

102
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,125
Pasta!

103
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,166
Put your
tomatoes away!
