1
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,666
[SPAIN] Romano!

2
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,125
No. No talking to me
when you look stupid.

3
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,000
Come on, faces sticking
in holes is hilarious!

4
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,416
Do it with me?

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,291
If it will get you to
shut the hell up, okay.

6
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,250
No, defin'ely
not hilarious.

7
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,250
Sei ridiculo.

8
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,625
[FRANCE laughs]

9
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:49,541
[BRITAIN] Bollocks!

10
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,166
Why do I have to
dress like this?

11
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,166
Because it is
April Fool's Day!

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,291
Wrong, loser!

13
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,708
This is all the
fault of a wanker.

14
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,916
What else shall I have to
endure to get my hands

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,291
on that bloody photograph?

16
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,291
Oh, you know, only
something you alone can do.

17
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,875
A fan request from
Ms. O from Tokyo.

18
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,500
"I want to see chibi
versions of everyone."

19
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,916
Of course, I realize
this needs special powers.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,916
So work that magic of yours,
and make it rapide!

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,208
Heh. You want me to
make you small, eh?

22
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:22,208
Oh. You naughty wizard boy.

23
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,208
[BRITAIN] Get ready to be wee!

24
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,458
Give me that picture,
you tiny pervert!

25
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,458
No way in hell!

26
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,333
[AMERICA] Stop!

27
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,208
Bullying kids isn't PC anymore!

28
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,250
Please help; he does not
understand no means no!

29
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,125
Dudes, I hardly
recognized you.

30
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,750
What's going on?

31
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,750
Why is France a midget
and Britain dressed like

32
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,708
he's about to torture
Jack Nicholson?

33
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,708
I dunno, why are you dressed
like a gay pride parade float?

34
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,083
Shut it, limey!

35
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,625
I got this costume along
with a letter this morning.

36
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,375
There's a picture of me
I'd rather people not see,

37
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,500
so to get it back I had to
show up here, dressed like this.

38
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,083
Canada was sent
the same letter,

39
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,250
but he doesn't seem
that worried about it.

40
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,333
Not worried about it.

41
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,125
[KUMAJIRO] No way, eh?

42
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,583
Too busy with hockey?

43
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,625
[CHINA] I received same
creepy letter, additionally!

44
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,375
[AMERICA and BRITAIN]
Uh, China?

45
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,333
Okay, for real, who would pull
such a disrespectful stunt?

46
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,458
This is so much embarrassment.

47
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,041
I do not like it.

48
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,791
[RUSSIA] So it's not just me.

49
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,666
Oh good, I have
greatness relief, now.

50
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,000
[BRITAIN] Russia, what the hell
are you doing in the sewer?

51
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,125
[CHINA] Literal gross mistake!

52
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,000
[RUSSIA] I'm embarrassed!

53
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,125
[GROUP] Hetalia!

54
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,708
Germany! Hey, Germany!

55
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,125
Check this out, it's an
embarrassing photo of me!

56
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,250
Don't show it off,
you imbecile!

57
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,458
Oh no, I remember
doing that now.

58
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,083
If someone were to see this,
I would not be happy.

59
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,666
I wish I could show
this around, I'm hot.

60
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,875
[FINLAND laughs]

61
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,083
That picture of me,
you took it didn't you?

62
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,291
What are you meaning,
you piece of blackmailer jerky?

63
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,666
You snuck a picture of me!

64
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,125
Stop! This is
not the funny.

65
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,833
I should be embarrassed,
but I'm just not!

66
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,875
Ha! Don't forget
also the fishnets!

67
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,083
[GROUP] Hetalia!

68
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,625
[AMERICA] Are you kidding me,
dude? France was behind this?

69
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,416
Hey, guys! Wait for me!

70
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,916
You look like you are breaking
your own pro-hate law.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,166
[AMERICA] Dude.

72
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,750
You need to give it up
already, Midget France.

73
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,333
Now where are those pictures?

74
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,958
I'm not the one in charge!

75
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,250
Wha--? All right,
then who is?

76
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,458
Get out,
it was you?

77
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,000
[SPAIN] Si, that
is right. It was me.

78
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:28,083
And I am muy, muy
furioso right now, too!

79
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,458
Uh!

80
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,125
We were supposed to all
meet at the plaza, not here!

81
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,791
Also, you guys look
funnier than me!

82
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,041
Uh!

83
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,583
[SPAIN] Although,
taking the time to show up

84
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,708
does mean a lot,
you know. Gracias!

85
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,500
[CHINA] Spain!

86
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,291
Explain what
is this about!

87
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,958
It's about April Fools
day, silly amigos!

88
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,541
I thought we could do
something different this year.

89
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,500
So, my plan was to get everyone
together and take the craziest,

90
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,375
most ridiculous picture ever!

91
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,125
See, like this funny one!

92
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,250
France, what kind of
invitation did you send

93
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,708
to get everyone
to show up?

94
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,750
[FRANCE] Uhh...

95
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,833
France made me
take their pictures

96
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,291
in compromising positions.

97
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,916
It was terrible.

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,500
Ah. Let's have
a little chat.

99
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,041
Help me, Pierre!

100
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,958
[FRANCE] I knew you
guys wouldn't come,

101
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,000
so I figured I'd invite you
in a more creative way.

102
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,541
Don't worry, I get rid
of these eventually!

103
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,708
Au revoir! See you next time!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

104
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,250
[GROUP] Agh!
Give me my picture!

105
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,708
[PRUSSIA] Huh?
