00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,208
[AMERICA (RICE CAKE)] 
Let's go! Heh, ha, ha, ha, ha!

2
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,416
S'up dudes?

3
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Today commemorates my one
hundred year anniversary!

4
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,875
Everyone have
fun rockin' out!

5
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,250
Can't believe it's already
been a hundred years.

6
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,875
It's no wonder I feel
so old these days.

7
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,166
Thanks for your
support, dude.

8
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,750
I gotta say, these years
have flown by for me, too!

9
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,416
Heh. To celebrate this
momentous occasion,

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,375
I have brought to you a present.

11
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,416
Seriously, bro?
That's kick ass!

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,583
You're the best
gay friend I have!

13
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,083
Uh-Uh....

14
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,750
Wait, does this
mean you want me

15
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,708
to put that thing
together myself?

16
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,208
[FEMALE NARRATOR]
It was rather expensive

17
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,375
to assemble so many
separate parts,

18
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,333
so New York City
was reluctant to pay

19
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,291
for setting up the
Statue of Liberty.

20
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,666
Ahem--cheap!

21
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:22,208
After that, I asked for
help with it and got

22
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,750
a lot of donations
and support

23
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,125
from all kinds of people
all over the country!

24
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:30,125
For a long time, no one
thought it would ever happen.

25
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,541
But eventually, the
Statue of Freakin' Liberty

26
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,916
was finished in New York Harbor!

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,125
Dude, that statue ended
up being the coolest gift

28
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,416
anyone's ever given me;
thanks so much!

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,083
Hearing you say
that makes me feel

30
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,833
it was almost
worth the trouble.

31
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,083
She inherited my beauty,
don't you think?

32
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,916
[AMERICA] No, I don't think.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,833
[BRITAIN] Blimey, it's been
more than one hundred years

34
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,416
since the little bugger
became independent.

35
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,833
As the gentleman I am today,

36
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,666
I think I can at least
celebrate his birthday--

37
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,208
[retches]

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,458
Wait a tick, what is it
he said about my gift?

39
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,708
Dude, that bell you gave me
got like totally cracked, man.

40
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,458
Did he even try
to be careful?

41
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,791
[chuckles]

42
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,916
Ah, what the hell.
I'll repair it for him anyway.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,333
[AMERICAN OFFICIAL 23A] Nah,
you really don't have to fix it.

44
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,083
I mean, no one
asked you to.

45
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,000
Right...

46
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,875
[FEMALE NARRATOR] Aw,
he got turned down.

47
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,166
[QUEEN ELIZABETH II] A gift
for the two hundred year

48
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,958
anniversary of his independence?

49
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,250
Indeed.

50
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,750
I believe sending one
would be a nice gesture.

51
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,833
Why, I think that
is a splendid idea.

52
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,416
For both sides, really.

53
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,916
Although, I'm rather surprised;

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,750
this type of giving
isn't like you.

55
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,625
I've become a mature adult
and a gentleman, Your Majesty.

56
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,666
I shall celebrate
with a wink and a sm--

57
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,125
[retches]

58
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,375
[QUEEN ELIZABETH II]
You don't have to try

59
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,750
so hard to look good.

60
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,375
Right. My apologies, mum.

61
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,541
Rubbish.

62
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,625
[AMERICA] S'up dudes?

63
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,458
Today commemorates my two
hundred year anniversary!

64
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,916
So everyone have
fun rockin' out!

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,708
Don't drink and drive!

66
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,166
I got these for you.

67
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,000
[AMERICA]
Oh, thanks!

68
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,791
[BRITAIN] Oi, guess who made it.

69
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,166
And surprise, I brought a
special birthday gift for you.

70
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,791
Dude, this is a celebration,
not a Disney villain conference,

71
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,000
so knock that off!

72
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,625
Tell me the birthday
gift is a joke because

73
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,458
I do not need any more of
your sarcasm, okay, dude?

74
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,833
[BRITAIN laughs]

75
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,833
Will you think it's not
sarcastic if I say it is?

76
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,416
If you would just open
your eyes and look,

77
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,833
you'd see the Two Hundred
Year Anniversary Edition

78
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,875
of the Liberty Bell!

79

[FLYING MINT BUNNY giggles]

80
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,666
[AMERICA] Uh...

81
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,833
Huh!

82
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,000
Whatever, if you
don't want it--

83
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,250
Wait a minute, dude,

84
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,958
didn'tcha call one of
my government offices

85
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,416
like twenty some
odd years ago

86
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,208
about those cracks I
told you were on the bell?

87
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,416
I certainly did, but I
was turned down flat.

88
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,291
[AMERICA laughs]

89
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,833
Okay, I get it. This is
a nice gift, my brother.

90
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,083
Just like ya, too.

91
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,083
Thank you, dude.
I appreciate it.

92
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,333
Well.

93
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,375
After two hundred years,
you're still a kid, so--

yeah, I know.

[AMERICA (RICE CAKE) laughs]

98
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,375
By the by, I got another gift
for you, from me personally.

99
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,375
For real, dude?
I get more stuff?

100
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,708
It's a unicorn; now,
take good care of him!

Noooo!
