00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,958
The Newspaper Club
went around W Academy,

00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,458
interviewing everyone about
their group activities.

4
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,416
They all sounded like fun to me!

I think it's time for merenda!
Can I have a gelato, please?

11
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,041
No snack-time
until we are done!

12

He is correct.
Let us wait for now.

And Norway.

And Iceland.

about us I'm ready to tell!

and eat

I do not think
I am spelling

"lingonberries"
correctly.

33

Freaky. But I'm still
the hero, so whatevs, bro!

I'm so glad you're asking
aboot joining the Canada Club.

45
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,416
We wear flannel shirts,
and eat poutine,

46
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,541
and tap maple trees for
their delicious sap,

47
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,166
and then sip our coffee and
gaze at our snowy mountains

48
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,000
as we smile aboot
our free health-care

That sounds cool.

But also
I am conflicted.

The Leave-Me-Aloners?

55
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,833
I don't like getting mixed
up in other people's drama,

56
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,250
so we don't ever have meetings.

57
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,416
Basically I just sit at home!

G'day! Fancy a
ten-kilometer swim?

75

This is the part
where I say maybe,

but I definitely mean no!

77

No. Italian!

you stop, Japan?
