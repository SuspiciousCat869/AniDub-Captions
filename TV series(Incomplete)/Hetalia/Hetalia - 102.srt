00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,458
[FEMALE NARRATOR] The Earth.

2
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,833
She's a big blue ball-buster
who takes no crap from anyone.

3
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,166
So like me.

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,375
She's home to the W Academy,

5
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,625
a unique school where
the countries of the world

6
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:33,500
hone their mutant pow--
I mean, live the student life.

7
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:55,875
[GERMANY] All right!

8
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,416
The focus of our
next issue is clubs!

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:58,916
[VOICE] Italy!

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,250
[ITALY] Aww!

11
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,625
But blunt-force trauma is
such a downer, Germany!

12
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,750
I think we should write
about pasta, or girls! Yeah!

13
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,375
I don't mean the
weapons, idiot!

14
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,250
I mean the student
organizations!

15
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,125
It was an
honest mistake!

16
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:12,833
Please, do not fight.

17
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:15,708
Let me mollify you with
empty carbohydrates.

18
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,250
Carbohydolateso?
Yum!

19
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,208
Permission to speak?

20
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,916
We have to raise our hands
this way because Germany!

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,666
I promise,
it is relevant.

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,916
All right. Talk about
your elephant.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,541
[JAPAN] I have created
a list of all weird groups

24
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:31,416
at the academy,
like, Karamu Siesta.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,416
What in the hell
is that one about?

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,750
Oh, I know!

27
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,916
They have parties with
piñatas and churros an--!

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,916
"Siesta," not "fiesta!"

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,375
Jawohl! We will interview
all of the activities.

30
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,041
Even the one for that
little-girl pony cartoon!

31
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,041
Newspaper Club go!

32
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,041
Ah, yelling and organizing;
classic Germany.

33
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,041
What?

34
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,875
You want to write about us?

35
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,541
I suppose I don't mind
putting it all out there.

36
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,958
Oh--you know, like what
you do at your meetings

37
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,791
and why I hear timpani drums
every time that you move.

38
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:00,958
Manners!

39
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,333
Estonia, would you
talk to them for me?

40
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,166
Okay. I'd be happy to.

41
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,625
Many of W Academy's
best students

42
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,875
have gravitated to our
little choir group.

43
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,875
Latvia and Lithuania are both
famous for their choruses,

44
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,458
so we Baltic states are
fitting right in around here.

45
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,083
His compliments
border on Lithu-mania.

46
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,166
You know, it is
not for the nothing

47
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,166
that they call me the "Singing
Revolution" back at the home.

48
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,333
It's Mister Sparkle!

49
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,250
The one most important
thing about the Madrigals--

50
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,791
[RUSSIA] Eh...?

51
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,208
--is that the Soviet Bloc wants
to lock us in the basement.

52
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,958
If you die, I get
great pleasure-smile.

53
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:35,958
Gott im Himmel!

54
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,333
Bro, enough of that!

55
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,000
Start asking questions about
my Daring-Dudes already!

56
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,416
We do cool crap 380 days a year!

57
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,250
You can quote
me on that!

58
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,541
What the--? Ahh!

59
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,625
The Cold War's over,
dude! Cut it out!

60
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,791
Perestroika! Perestroika!

61
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,000
[JAPAN] Oh my.

62
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,166
[AMERICA] I thought
that was the safe-word!

63
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,500
[JAPAN (RICE CAKE)]
So, that happened.

64
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,041
It's about time!

65
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,375
I wondered when you'd get your
act together and come over!

66
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,625
We are very exclusive group-
it is just the three of us!

67
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,875
We are a triumvirate
of refined palates,

68
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:07,000
the intrepid epicureans of
the academy's Gastronauts!

69
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,333
Aww. I wanted to
be a Gastronauts,

70
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,000
but you guys wouldn't let me!

71
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,750
Because--watching you drown
everything in tomato sauce

72
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,208
would be the death of me.

73
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,500
We turned down Britain,
as well, so cheer up!

74
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,166
[TURKEY]
Posting pics of my food!

75
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,500
[FRANCE]
Paying too much for cheese!

76
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,125
[CHINA] Putting
rare animal on menu!

77
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,416
Gastronaut
powers, activate!

78
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,791
They're certainly full of
themselves, aren't they?

79
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,875
Certainly full
of something.

80
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,250
[JAPAN (RICE CAKE)]
Moving along.

81
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,208
Welcome to the lair
of the Hellfire Club!

82
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,208
But what sort of coven would
we be if we blabbed our secrets

83
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,416
to every stringer
who came a-knockin'?

84
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,166
So, if you truly are
dead-set on talking to me,

85
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,333
just bend this spoon with
the power of your mind

86
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,666
and I guess I can allow it.

87
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,375
I cannot help but wonder
which of the four houses

88
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,416
the hat put you in.

89
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,625
What?

90
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,125
You know, I have ways
of making you talk.

91
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:54,875
[BRITAIN]
What?

92
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,125
Fork that spoon!

93
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,791
Your Teutonic prowess
is the stuff of legend!

94
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,625
We having so
much fun here!

95
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,083
In fact just last week,

96
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,500
we venture down into dungeon
to fight band of orcs,

97
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,708
and Britain leveled up his
wizard twice, and rolled a...

98
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,458
Oh, so you're nerds!

99
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,000
Bollocks! Now they know the
truth about the Hellfire Club!

100
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,333
Really we just get
together and tabletop!

101
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,458
The best of luck to you
in your future wizarding.

102
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,250
All of the groups had
something in common.

103
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,333
There didn't seem to be a single
normal country in the bunch.

104
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,583
That's what makes them
interesting, right?

105
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,458
Don't you judge!
You three are the freaks!

106
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,708
It seems in some way
we are all unusual.

107
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,333
[ITALY] Worst cliffhanger ever!
