Previously on Hetalia,

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,625
Italy went to Africa because who
knows and you don't really care.

00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,666
We have proven to
Germany and Italy that

on this the African war front,
British Empire intelligence

00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,041
cannot be bested!

Those tossers were like babies

00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,791
before my brilliant boiled
egg manufacturing machine!

--[EGG CAN] Adorable!

Yeah, boiled eggs are well good!

00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:58,625
Having tea peacefully
like this after a victory

13
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,083
makes me feel just-- Let's
see how should I put it,

14
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,458
simply terrifically gentlemanly.

[AMERICA] Sorry to keep
you waiting, dude!

00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,708
But, you don't gotta worry
nomore because the hero,

20
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,541
which is me, is here.

What's the deal, bro?

00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,958
Not like you to have a hard time
dealing with those creeps.

25
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:27,916
You got old, huh?

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,416
I'm not old!

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,250
And you wouldn't dare say that
if you had seen me fight!

28
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,625
Yeah, whatever dude.

29
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,833
The point is, I'm here now,
so you can chill out.

Are you serious?

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,041
You can't go with that
lame ass operation!

Oh, yes, I can!

39
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,333
Some of us like to be careful
and make informed decisions,

40
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,833
instead of charging in all willy
nilly like an impetuous toddler!

41
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,083
You need to work on your
indecisiveness, dude.

42
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah, well, you need
to work on shut up!

43

There's no shame in caution!

This dude is Mister Britain?

I know you guys are brothers,

46

but you don't really
look that much alike.

[BOTH gasp]

Well, of course we don't.

Oh how shall I put it, um...

51
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,208
This is awkward when you
just say it out loud.

52
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,500
What were you saying?
Who me? A big brother?

53
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,166
Flattery will get you nowhere,
or everywhere, depending.

If we keep looking at each
other maybe, he'll go away.

Uh...

[AMERICA]
Dudes, I'm a hero!

57
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,916
I'll go say hello
to all the locals,

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,750
and subtly let them
know that I've arrived!

What?!

You did not seriously bring
your military band with you.

Duh, Bruh. Can't be
flashy without music,

62
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,208
and the African people have
kinda been waiting for me.

63
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,041
I do not understand!
why did you even come here?

64
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,625
Uh, because a real
hero was needed.

65
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,458
Yo!

00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,333

Please go away forever.

You are quite pathetic.

Oh, come on. What's
the matter, big fella?

Well, now what am I
going to do with you?

Listen, don't let
it get you down.

71
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,875
This is just how Africa is,
and you're not used to it yet.

72
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,625
I'm not wanted here very
much, either. Trust me.

73
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,625
There's no reason
to feel gutted.

Thanks, but I'm good.

a marshmallow.

comforting for you!

in Africa is just always hot.

besides this Marmite
poo-food, don't we?

It's nutritious, so
eat it. Eat all of it!

that hill over there because

appropriate for me.

reasonable for someone my age
