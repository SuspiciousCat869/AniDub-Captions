1
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:17,708
Yo! What's up?

2
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,041
Let's start the
Nordic Council meeting!

3
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:41,416
Oh, it's a lovely day!
Perfect for a nice meeting.

4
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,625
Yeah, you're welcome!

5
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,291
You know it's always
sunny when I'm around!

6
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,000
[NORWAY] Meh, you know it's
always sunny when I'm around.

7
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:51,208
Whoo! Come on! Nordic Council
meetings rock the house!

8
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,125
--Ha, ha, ha!
--[ICELAND] I don't get it.

9
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,875
How come no one has
noticed I'm here?

10
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,291
I agree, today is
perfect day for meetings.

11
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,250
Have some of homemade
sweet treats I brought.

12
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,708
[ICELAND]
First, I've gotta compete with

13
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,833
this glasses
wearing non-Nord?

14
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,125
Of course, I have no
doubt you'd love to let me,

15
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,083
a most excellent
nation, join you.

16
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,500
Estonia! You didn't
have to bring these!

17
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,083
Kiiti, that was so thoughtful!

18
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,708
Eat the sweet treats, everyone.
They're sweetie and treatie!

19
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:18,458
[ICELAND] And... I'm already
losing to Baltic Four-Eyes.

20
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,541
[ESTONIA]
Hm?

21
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:20,875
[chuckles]

22
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:21,916
[ICELAND]
Gross.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,375
What's his deal?

24
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,208
--[SWEDEN] Ice.
--[ICELAND gasps]

25
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,416
Are you okay?

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,291
[ICELAND]
Yeah, Svi.

27
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm fine. It's just...

28
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:31,916
I think there's
something weird

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,541
happening with this meeting.

30
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,875
[ICELAND]
Second, our meeting site

31
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,791
isn't exactly what
I'd call "appropriate."

32
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,291
Let's meeting!

33
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,541
We can't start without a little
of this to get warmed up!

34
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,041
So, bring on the booze!

35
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,125
[ICELAND] Third, we're here
for a so-called discussion,

36
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,708
but Dan's already busted
out the alcohol, again.

37
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:47,833
Oh, don't worry.

38
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,333
I brought you a very
special beverage.

39
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:53,833
Aren't you lucky to have
such a capable big brother?

40
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,625
[ICELAND] There he goes with
his gratuitous consideration.

41
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,250
I'm just going to pretend
I didn't hear him.

42
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,625
[FINLAND]
Don't worry, Ice!

43
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,500
As long as you're at
Mister Ta's house,

44
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,250
if you're with a guardian,
you can drink no problem!

45
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,250
Takk, but I'm not a child.

46
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,541
[ICELAND]
Fourth, normally Finland would

47
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,041
add some random comment here.

48
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,166
But he's already gone.

49
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,166
So much eating and drinking.

50
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,208
If we had a sauna, this would
be the best meeting ever!

51
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,541
That's what I'm screaming!

52
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,666
[ICELAND]
Fin's in his fantasy land.

53
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,750
Hey, Svi...

54
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,208
I have a question.

55
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,416
Ja?

56
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,125
Don't we usually have
more dignified and,

57
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,791
you know, indoor meetings?

58
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,541
[SWEDEN]
Mm.

59
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,958
[ICELAND]
Today's meeting is, I would say,

60
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,333
kind of on the strange
side, don't you agree?

61
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,500
[SWEDEN]
Hm.

62
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,375
Oh, good.

63
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,208
Thank you for being normal.

64
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,708
[ICELAND]
Uh...

65
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,666
[ICELAND] Does this mean
I am the weird one?

66
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,625
I do live the farthest away.

67
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,750
[VOICES]
Yes!

68
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,625
--[DENMARK] Yo, Ice!
--[ICELAND gasps]

69
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,750
Happy Birthday to you,
our funny Ice Man!

70
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,166
This wasn't a meeting at all.

71
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,333
It was a surprise party for you,
and you're wery welcome!

72
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,875
I raised Ice, you know!

73
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,458
Oh, thank you,

74
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,750
but I'm guessing this gathering
must be some new European fad?

75
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,708
For real, it's not even
my birthday, guys.

76
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,500
Of course not, it's halfway
between your birthday and mine.

77
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,916
You're telling me grown men
throw these "parties"?

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,958
Don't be angry.

79
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,291
We only lied to you
to be friendly.

80
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,375
Now, let's celebrate
your birthday?

81
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,375
We're too old to be
celebrating getting older.

82
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,041
[DENMARK]
Let's party!

83
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,083
I don't do childish fantasies.

84
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,750
[DENMARK]
Let's party!

85
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,458
Or you could get some work done!

86
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,458
I don't need to work,
and you haven't let us

87
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,833
celebrate your BD with
you in like ten years.

88
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,833
We chose a location that
wouldn't be too obvious.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,750
Why are you against it?

90
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,625
[ICELAND]
No matter how much older I get,

91
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,583
the age difference between me
and them will never shrink.

92
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,875
Why care? So what? It's stupid.

93
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,583
[DENMARK]
Eh?

94
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:49,916
Hold the phone, Ice.

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,708
You're not wearing your
normal ugly sweater today.

96
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,041
How are we supposed to
know that you're you?

97
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,500
[VOICE]
Lopapeysa!

98
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,875
Why do you care so much
about what I wear?!

99
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,083
Aw, now, don't
listen to him, Ice!

100
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,583
I think... you dress... cool!

101
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,416
Cool like when
you see the ugly,

102
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,166
you wish you were
frozen to death.

103
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,250
Ha, ha!

104
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,708
That is true.

105
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,041
Whatever, you guys are just
too old to get my fashion.

106
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,583
Ha! You better wear your
normal ugly sweater

107
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,625
at the next meeting!

108
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,333
Hey, Ice, can I get
a sweater like--

109
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,958
No! We're also too old to
be wearing matching outfits.

110
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,166
It's creepy!

111
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,875
Oh, come on, we should
all match next time!

112
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,750
[SWEDEN]
Mm...

113
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,083
It's so wonderful when
we can get along.

114
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,916
Your next Nordic
member, Estonia,

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,916
signing off for the night!
