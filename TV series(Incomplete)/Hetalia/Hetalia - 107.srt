Not really.

the carpet matches
the drapes, get it?

No, they do not.

29
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,291
Well, your carpet has
lots of dirt particles

30

that need removal.

31
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,625
A lint roller is a great
tool for picking up dirt

and loose hairs.

Tada!

There's nothing better

than a vacuum, dude!

refreshing than a good soak.
