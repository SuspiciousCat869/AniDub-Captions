1
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,583
[GERMANY] That concludes
today's training.

2
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:19,500
Dismissed!

3
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,750
Yay, thank you,
Commander!

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,250
But first, here is
your good-bye hug!

5
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,750
Ja, ja.

6
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,500
Addio, Germany!
I'll be seeing you tomorrow!

7
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,125
[GERMANY] I still can't
figure out what he's thinking.

8
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,416
What is with the kissing and
the hugging all the time?

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,083
Gimme hug! I like you, Germany!

10
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,166
[GERMANY] Cultural
differences, maybe?

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,625
Hmm?

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,125
"Understand How
Other People Think"?

13
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,541
Wunderbar!

14
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,916
Jew Gramps!

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,500
Give me a copy of that book!
And do it on the double!

16
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,250
[JEW GRAMPS 21A] Danke! Danke!

17
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,041
[JEW GRAMPS 21A]
That book didn't sell at all

18
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,208
in Italy and Spain,
but for some reason,

19
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,833
it's selling like
schnitzel in Germany!

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,291
[GERMANY] Hey, Austria.
Are you going somewhere?

21
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,541
You are so stupid,
so very stupid.

22
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,041
Do you have any idea how
important tomorrow is?

23
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,208
It's the day men give
gifts to women they love

24
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,791
or maybe just have
bodies they love?

25
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,833
Duh! Valentine's Day!

26
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,041
Ja, whatever, just
don't get lost again.

27
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,375
I don't have the time
to come get you.

28
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,333
Fine, then.
Thanks for nothing.

29
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,958
He was expecting
to get lost?

30
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,875
[GERMANY] Hmm. Let's see,
where's the Italian chapter?

31
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,375
Huh?

32
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,583
[explosion sounds]

33
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,708
This book is fail.

34
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,083
I've just finished making
these, won't you try them?

35
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,250
What sort of cooking
makes explosion sounds

36
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,208
come from
the kitchen, eh?

37
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,208
So, I have
ein question.

38
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,875
Let's say I see a
person every day,

39
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,750
and we are constantly
hugging and kissing,

40
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,458
and taking baths, and
sleeping in the same bed.

41
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,750
What sort of relationship
do you think that is?

42
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,125
An indecent one,
obviously.

43
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,250
[GERMANY] Indecent?

44
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,291
Well, unless
he meant Italy.

45
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,666
[ITALY] Morning, world!

46
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,791
Today, I'm going to kick
war stuff training's ass!

47
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,583
And yay, it's also
San Valentino Day, too!

48
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:20,291
Hey. I should get presents
for Japan and Germany!

49
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,208
Scusi! Can I buy some flowers?

50
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,708
Of course-a;
you're in luck.

51
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,000
I just-a made a few
fresh rose-a bouqets!

52
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,958
Ooh, che bellissimo.
I'll take two, please!

53
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,458
Going to work
with roses. Yay!

54
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm so fancy and I like it!

55
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,750
[ITALIAN MALE FLORIST 21A]
Thanks, signore!

56
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:36,875
I see.

57
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,583
Italy just likes me
as a close friend,

58
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,541
so that means I've got
nothing to worry about,

59
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,750
nothing to worry about at all.

60
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,666
Morning. Hope you're
well, Commander.

61
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,041
I've got good news!

62
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,541
"Good news"?
Great.

63
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,916
This is from me!

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,916
It's a present for
the Valentine's Day!

65
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,833
Germany?
What's wrong?

66
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:03,333
[GERMANY] You are giving me red
roses on today of all days?

67
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,416
What does it mean?

68
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,833
Um. Exactly what
it looks like?

69
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,833
[GERMANY]
"Exactly what it looks like?"

70
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:12,041
But it cannot be;
he is just ein friend.

71
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,458
Who else have you
given roses to today?

72
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,458
Well, I guess you're
the only one, Germany!

73
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,833
Why?!

74
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,041
Does it not seem strange
to be only giving me a gift?

75
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,500
I'm confused.

76
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,958
Come on, there must be ein
girl or zwei that you like?

77
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,583
Surely, you've been
in love before.

78
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,125
Oh, yeah, I guess that
is technically the truth,

79
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,083
but it's uh--complicated.

80
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:34,083
So, this was just a
Three's Company style mix-up.

81
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,833
Um. It was kind of
a guy, though.

82
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,250
Ahhh! I'm sorry;
I'm so sorry!

83
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,041
[ITALY] So.

84
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,458
You want to play football?

85
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,291
[GERMANY] Ja. Good idea.

86
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,583
Okay. Here we go!

87
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,750
[GERMANY] He confessed
his feelings to me.

88
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,500
I feel as though a
response is necessary.

89
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,125
Do I tell him, "Nein"?

90
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,958
But it is not like I
hate him or anything.

91
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:57,875
Wait!

92
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,500
That was pretty good.

93
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,791
Wrong, not
good or pretty!

94
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,375
Fine! I'm sorry!
No football, then!

95
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:09,000
[GERMANY] Oh, what am
I supposed to do now?

96
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,000
Miss Hungary, looks like
you've got a package, here.

97
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,541
Oh, something for me?

98
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,125
Who sent it?

99
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,375
[HUNGARIAN DELIVERY MAN] Sorry;
I'm not supposed to tell you,

100
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,166
but I'll give you a hint.

101
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,041
It was someone wearing glasses
who had one weird cowlick.

102
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,625
Oh, okay! I got it!
