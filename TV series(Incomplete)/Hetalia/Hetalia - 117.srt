1
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,541
But I'm a virgin!

2
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,416
Just shut up
and keep going!

3
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,458
No! I'm not running
from you anymore!

4
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:32,375
[TEEN BOY 17A yells]

5
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,500
[AMERICA] All right!
That dude's the hero!

6
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:40,333
America. You should
know an important fact.

7
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,291
The main characters
in your horror movies

8
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,583
are far too strong!

9
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,583
[KIDS] Yeah!

10
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,208
[KIDS] Yeah! Yeah!

11
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,791
The way they can always
take down evil monsters

12
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,208
is not realistic!

13
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,458
Uh, yeah it is.

14
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,583
No, it's not!

15
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,666
Dude. We also have
a chick possessed

16
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,083
by a demon who kills her
whole family on video.

17
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,416
Sacre bleu! That's terrifying!

18
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,375
Okay, why did you want us to
bring over our horror movies

19
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,708
at such a busy time?

20
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,000
I thought we could compare
different styles, bro!

21
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,166
[FRANCE] Ignore him.

22
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,750
I thought we could
prove to America

23
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,625
how weird his horror
movies really are.

24
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,166
I like this game!

25
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,583
Can we watch the movie I brought
over first, please, can we?

26
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,541
My Spaghetti Horror
is one of the things

27
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,208
I'm the most famous for!

28
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,500
[FRANCE] Somehow I doubt pasta
is a decent medium for terror.

29
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:46,125
[GERMANY] I would not make fun
of Italy's movies if I were you.

30
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,625
No?

31
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,541
To put it simply. Italy's films
are a chaotic bombardment

32
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:53,083
of various entrails
and naked women.

33
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,000
Especially the entrails.

34
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,500
Sounds gratuitous.

35
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,916
Why would you have
a horror movie

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,750
without putting in the insides?

37
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,416
Because! People are sensitive
about their entrails!

38
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,500
[ITALY] Why?

39
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:04,958
Without guts,
what makes it horror?

40
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,916
Am I right?

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,416
I see your point.

42
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,958
Next I show you the best
horror movie ever made.

43
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,791
Wait. It does not fit in here.

44
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,500
Because you're trying
to put in a CD, ninny!

45
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,291
[FEMALE NARRATOR] You, too,
can learn how to compress

46
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,000
video files onto a CD.

47
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,833
Just go ask the internet.

48
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,083
[ITALY] Oh! A Chinese Zombie!

49
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,541
Yeah, that doesn't
really hurt at all.

50
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,291
Dude, check it out;
China's horror is hilarious!

51
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,416
[ITALY] Whoa!

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,666
You know, lately,

53
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,708
we've been making scary,
supernatural movie, too.

54
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,666
[MALE VOICE] Ka-boom!

55
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,750
[FRANCE] There's something
right behind you!

56
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,500
[JAPAN] How long has it been

57
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,291
since I last visited
my hometown?

58
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,208
The villagers were distant,

59
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:54,458
and seemed to be hiding
something from me.

60
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,625
It looks as though the
school has been closed.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,708
[ITALY screams]

62
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,250
Japan's horror is dark.

63
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,083
It's good at giving
you anxious poops.

64
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,083
Thank you for
the compliment.

65
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,208
Yeah, they're pretty
frightening, but I mean.

66
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,333
I always feel like the
hero should be doing more.

67
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,958
More like what?

68
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:20,208
You know, go for the
easy answer for once.

69
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,708
Like don't let
them make it out.

70
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,500
Keep 'em in the TV.

71
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,333
Or no freaking out at
some blurry bullcrap.

72
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,750
Or just don't answer
the phone, dude.

73
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:30,625
It's easy!

74
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:31,875
[CROWD cheers]

75
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,875
Classic America
comment.

76
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,625
Please don't
say such things.

77
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,958
Japanese ghosts
are very sensitive.

78
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,583
[FINLAND] You like weird horror?

79
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,500
Don't forget about my movies!

80
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,750
Santa kills!

81
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,750
Right. Finland
knows weird.

82
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,166
[FINLAND] It all
starts with a scene

83
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,041
where a scary, frozen
Santa Claus gets excavated.

84
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,041
[BRITAIN] Excavated?

85
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:58,041
[SANTA CLAUS] Merry Christmas.

86
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,208
[FINLAND] The climax
shows naked Santa Clauses

87
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,916
running all over the places.

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,750
And their junk is blurry!

89
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,500
[BRITAIN] Scary in
more ways than one.

90
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,708
[ITALY] Why? Santa
is a good person!

91
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,791
Why?

92
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,208
If you want true horror,
mine are bueno?

93
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,416
Shut it!

94
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,708
We do not need to
traumatize everyone!

95
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,208
I want to see them
for sure, now!

96
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,791
[FEMALE NARRATOR] Spanish horror
movies are fairly well known

97
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,541
for stabbing you right
in your brain space.

98
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,541
Ah!

99
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,625
I just got traumatized!

100
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,583
[GHOST groans]
