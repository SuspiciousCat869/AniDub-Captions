2
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,416
Congrats to me for winning the
"Carry Your Wife" competition,

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,625
not that anyone was
very much surprised.

4
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,000
It was fun taking the
pictures with Finland.

5
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,750
I'll put them up on my blog.

6
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:31,958
Ah!

7
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,708
What the holy heck is this?

8
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,958
My precious blog.

9
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,541
It's been turned into
a fan site for Russia!

10
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,166
Is big problem!

11
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,541
All Estonian
websites are hacked!

12
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,791
Oh no! I just found out

13
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,041
my blog has been with
the hijacked as well.

14
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,500
[MALE ESTONIAN B]
Agh! Such horror!

15
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:15,208
[ESTONIA] Who would draw a
picture of Russia looking cute?

16
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:18,666
And then why would they
put it all over my page?

17
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,833
The truth is...

18
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,708
...only one person
could have done this.

19
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:24,958
[RUSSIA] What?

20
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,708
Someone broke into
your blogging website?

21
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:30,791
That's not all--
They put up a drawing.

22
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,291
It was of you!

23
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:36,083
A drawing of you having
all the cuteness!

24
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:39,708
[ESTONIA] Why does he
always do this to me?

25
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,083
Not to be rude, but--

26
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,041
I am doubtful of your
innocence, Russia.

27
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,041
Who else would pull
this kind of crazy stunt?

28
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,041
I do not know
friend Estonia.

29
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,708
It is not me,
I swear it.

30
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,625
Do I need to
convince you?

31
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,208
Because I know
what will solve this

32
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,416
with no more
questions asked.

33
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,833
Magic metal
pipe of pain!

34
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,000
[ESTONIA screams]

35
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,208
Eh?

36
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,333
Estonia, dude!

37
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,750
Lithuania told me the deets,
so I'm here to help, bra!

38
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, America?

39
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,500
When it comes to
this internet stuff,

40
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,083
I am the man, my man!

41
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,250
Now let's track this bad
guy down, blow him up,

42
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,333
and send him to hell!

43
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,041
Wow. Yes thanks,
please be having at it.

44
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
[bird chirps]

45
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,083
S'up, bird! What's the haps?

46
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,041
Brah, your connection is slow.

47
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,375
[ESTONIA] Well,
it is a DSL line, so.

48
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,166
[FEMALE NARRATOR] Estonia's
internet is notoriously slow,

49
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,166
so connectivity
tends to be an issue.

50
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,291
Or 90's retro
for the hipsters.

51
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,583
Of course, American
sites don't help,

52
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,583
what with Flash pages, huge
images, full-screen videos,

53
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,875
and hilarious cats.

54
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,291
[ESTONIA (RICE BALL) yells]

55
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,041
We're getting
close here, dude.

56
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,791
And you?
Find anything?

57
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,291
Thanks to you, I think
we'll get him soon.

58
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,958
While you've been closing
in on his location,

59
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,791
I've been analyzing the
records left on the server.

60
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,166
I am starting to see
traces of him, now!

61
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,375
It is very exciting.

62
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,416
Check and
mate, hacker!

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,458
[ESTONIA] This is
where you lose, Russia.

64
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:24,833
Wasn't me!

65
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,208
Yes,
it was.

66
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:26,750
Yeah!

67
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,458
Heh. Who's that?

68
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,875
The hero
strikes again!

69
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,333
[ESTONIA] 
I don't understand.

70
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,208
According to my calculation,
the culprit was--

71
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,958
Estonia!

72
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,083
I'm sorry about the
other day, buddy!

73
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,875
So the culprit
has been caught!

74
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,833
I'm glad to hear that, yeah,
now I can read your blog again!

75
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,958
I've been cleared
of suspicion.

76
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,833
And things have
been settled amicably.

77
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:53,583
What? Are you for serious?

78
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,041
No, is funny joke!

79
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,583
You knew this would not be end.

80
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,416
[ESTONIA] Ah, that was funny.

81
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,666
[RUSSIA]
Magic metal pipe of pain!

82
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,125
[ESTONIA laughs]

83
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:31,208
The end credits were three
times longer than the movie!
