1
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,708
[LISA] When I was 19,

2
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,666
I took a trip alone to
France, in the Spring.

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,500
I've always been captivated
by the idyllic scenery

4
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,666
of Mont San-Michelle.

5
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,833
[LISA] There was so
much beauty all around.

6
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,916
I nearly filled my camera's
memory on the first day!

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,208
Oh wow! What a hunk!

8
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,333
[LISA gasps]

9
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:44,833
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,416
I took your picture
without asking.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,666
Oh! No problem, ma cherie.

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,083
And I'm sorry for
approaching you so brutishly.

13
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,416
You're magnetic.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,666
[LISA] Uh...

15
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,708
Are you here on holiday?

16
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,666
If you would like, perhaps
I could show you around?

17
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,916
Not if it's
any trouble.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,916
Vous etes tres belle!
Bien sur je vais bien!

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Come, Madame!
Your tour awaits!

20
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:10,958
[LISA] And that was
my introduction

21
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,333
to the charmingly
narcissistic France.

22
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,125
[FRANCE] Come. This way!

23
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:31,500
[LISA] Okay!

24
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,708
O-Ohh...

25
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,875
To bring cute,
impressionable tourist girls,

26
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,083
there is no finer
spot on the island.

27
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,250
Sorry, what was that?

28
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,791
[FRANCE chuckles]

29
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,291
[LISA] So, uh.

30
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,750
My name is Lisa.

31
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,333
I don't think I
got yours, good sir.

32
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,291
Oh? Moi?

33
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,125
They call me France, my darling.

34
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,583
I strike when the
mood strikes me.

35
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,208
If you're a tour guide,
you have credentials, right?

36
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,708
Never mind that.
There is so much more!

37
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,125
How do you say
'Rohypnol' in French?

38
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,125
On a lighter note, have you ever
heard of the Hundred Years' War?

39
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,125
I know a bit.

40
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,708
Smart and pretty?

41
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,583
A war raged between
Britain and France.

42
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,375
Many things led
to the conflict.

43
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,208
Claims on territory,
the Throne, flocks of sheep.

44
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,666
They captured our king.

45
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,083
And Britain demanded a
ransom of three million écus

46
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,250
for his release!

47
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,750
My bad!
I got caught.

48
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,125
Sadly, due to lavish living,
we were bankrupt!

49
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,083
It was the king, not me!

50
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,125
Even the breathtaking
Mont Saint-Michel

51
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,750
acted as a stronghold!

52
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,125
For real?

53
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,125
[FRANCE] When things
seemed absolutely hopeless

54
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:38,291
during the war, a girl was
sent with a divine mission.

55
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,208
She knelt before the
Dauphin, and said--

56
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,541
[JOAN] Your Highness.

57
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,333
God has spoken to me.

58
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,666
He commanded me
to make you king!

59
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,416
And do you know who
that brave girl was?

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,041
Joan of Arc. Like, duh--

61
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,000
Of course! That's so
awesome that you know!

62
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,916
'Cause I totally knew it too!

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,625
[LISA] Where did those
head sparkles come from?

64
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,166
[FRANCE] Joan's first job was
reviving the flagging hope

65
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,875
of a disheartened king.

66
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,583
After lifting the
siege at Orléans,

67
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,166
she brought the king to Reims,

68
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,208
the traditional coronation site,

69
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,791
where he assumed the French
throne as Charles the Seventh.

70
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,291
Just proves what
a girl can do

71
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,000
when you take away
the glass ceiling.

72
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,291
[FRANCE] She accomplished
all of this in four months.

73
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,041
Only the Home Alone
kid could top that.

74
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,916
But, there was
no happy ending.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,291
'Cause y'know, they burned her
at the stake and all, right?

76
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,708
[FRANCE] Sadly, yes.

77
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,916
In Fourteen Thirty-One, during
the closing days of May.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,666
She put the king on his throne,
and he abandoned her to flame.

79
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,458
It seems the stronger
one's patriotism is,

80
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,625
the more often they are
beset by tragedies, oui?

81
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,041
[LISA] I suppose so.

82
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,500
[FRANCE] I may have taken that
bit from a fortune cookie.

83
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,666
That is enough
history talk, eh?

84
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,875
Let me tell you a
little about myself.

85
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,750
Of all the countless
people tossed into

86
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,208
the crushing jaws of history.

87
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,583
I wish their souls
a chance at rebirth.

88
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,833
Into a peaceful life--
a warm home.

89
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,708
And all the love they're due.

90
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,250
When I first laid eyes on you,

91
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,250
I realized a true
miracle had occured.

92
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,375
May you always find happiness.

93
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,833
And my wish came true!

94
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,750
I could not've picked
a finer person.

95
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,625
Thanks, but what do you--?

96
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,000
Huh?

97
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,041
He was here
just a second ago.

98
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,375
Who was he?

99
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,041
Then like the wind, my
mysterious stranger vanished!

100
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,666
[MOTHER] Sounds like
my Harlequin novels!

101
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,958
[LISA laughs]

102
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,958
[AMERICA] Jeez, man.
France is a total playah!
