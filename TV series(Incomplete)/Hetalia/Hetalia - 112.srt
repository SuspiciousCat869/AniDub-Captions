[AMERICA (RICE CAKE) chuckles]

2
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,208
[RUSSIA (RICE CAKE) laughs]

3
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,416
We are friends, dude!

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,416
[RUSSIA (RICE CAKE)] Drug?

5
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,375
Heck yeah!

6
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,375
[RUSSIA (RICE CAKE)] Spasibo!

7
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,625
[JAPAN sighs]

8
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,791
A nice, hot soak is the best.

9
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:14,000
So relaxing and always so quiet.

10
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,708
[AMERICA] Japan!
You in there, dude?

11
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,583
Guess what? I have
some amazingly cool news!

12
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:19,916
Let's play, brah!

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,750
Japan! C'mon, let's carve
some pumpkins hardcore!

14
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,000
Dude! We can roast the
seeds and everything!

15
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,333
[JAPAN] Why does he have
to show up right now?

16
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,166
Don't take this the
wrong way, America,

17
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,833
but what are you doing here?

18
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,583
[AMERICA] Duh, I'm came to
invite you over to my place!

19
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,416
Happy Halloween, homie!

20
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,708
[JAPAN yells]

21
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:40,666
[AMERICA] Boys and
girls at home,

22
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,125
don't try destroying your
friends' window frames

23
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,958
so you can break in to their
houses unless you have to!

24
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,833
Huff! Please just
fix it and leave.

25
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:52,250
So now, once more,
why did you come here?

26
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,541
Dude, I wanted to invite you to

27
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,750
a badass Halloween
bash at my place!

28
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,375
Oh. Isn't Halloween a festivity

29
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,041
with a fairy-tale theme
and pumpkins and costume?

30
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,125
Yeah. But no,

31
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,541
I mean kinda,
but not exactly.

32
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:04,833
You'll know it
when you see it!

33
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,708
Now, come on over,
you douche bag!

34
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,625
Welcome to the
Dungeon of Horrors,

35
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,541
aka American Halloween!

36
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,541
Thank you, I think, but
what are these things about?

37
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,500
What?

38
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,041
They are not
very cute at all.

39
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,125
Of course not.

40
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,583
Oh yeah, I remember.

41
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,291
You're big on the
cute stuff, huh?

42
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,916
Halloween is based on scary
stories about ghosts, demons,

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,625
and creepy crap coming
back from the dead

44
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,125
around this time every year.

45
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,166
So, what we gotta do
to protect ourselves

46
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,666
from these evil spirits is
to dress up just like 'em.

47
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,791
If we blend in,
they won't kill us.

48
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,000
You mentioned pumpkins,
which is totally true for me,

49
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,875
but that's my
personal killer style.

50
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,041
Britain's weird
and uses turnips.

51
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,291
Bollocks, cocked it up.

52
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,333
[AMERICA] I don't even
know what a turnip is.

53
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,541
Now I get it.

54
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,583
But why tell me
about this festivity?

55
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,166
Because, dude, I need your
help now more than ever!

56
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,458
N-Nani?

57
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,500
Dude, you're like the
master of horror stuff.

58
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,750
Come on, who else is there?

59
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,333
[BRITAIN] Yes.

60
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,333
I love this holiday; it always
puts me in ruddy good spirits.

61
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,958
[BRITAIN laughs]

62
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,375
This year, I'm going to scare
the ever-loving almighty

63
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,458
out of America.

64
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,041
I kept calm. I carried on.

65
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,750
And after three days I found
something truly horrifying!

66
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,416
Once again, I shall
win the Halloween

67
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Scare-Your-Bloomers-
Off Contest!

68
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,708
I get it, all right, but
I am rather an old fairy;

69
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,208
do you really think I'm scary
enough for the big finale?

70
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,416
You're scary
as hell, mate.

71
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,708
Have faith
in yourself.

72
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,583
[BRITAIN] Now, let's
go prank that Yank!

73
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,916
[OLD FAIRY]
Well, if you say so.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,708
So. You're telling me you have

75
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,500
a Halloween scaring competition
with Britain every year?

76
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,041
First thing in
the morning, dude.

77
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,333
As it stands, I've got
a total of zero wins

78
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,166
and eighty-seven losses.

79
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,791
[AMERICA] When I was a kid,
Britain dressed up

80
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,041
in this costume that
totally freaked me out.

81
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,541
We've been doing it ever since.

82
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,000
[JAPAN] So. You're
telling me he started it.

83
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,208
I'm thinking this time,

84
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,291
I use a little crazy
Japanese horror goods.

85
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,583
We can have a girl
who's like soaking wet

86
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,875
ambush him in the back room.

87
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,500
He'll get so scared,
he'll have a heart attack!

88
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,375
Just one moment,
please.

89
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,875
I would assume he's expecting
something to be hiding

90
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,541
in the back room,
so I doubt it would be

91
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,000
a particularly
effective scare tactic.

92
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,250
For real?

93
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,500
The core of horror is a
fear of the unexpected,

94
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,333
so let us try shifting
things around.

95
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,875
It will be better if we
start with a strong impact

96
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,875
and prey on his
already existing fears.

97
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,500
[BRITAIN] Oi, America!

98
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,166
Trick or treat!

99
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,166
Ha--!

100
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,416
--ppy Halloween.

101
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,666
[BRITAIN screams]

102
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,500
Same to you,
old chum!

103
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,625
It's a mask.

104
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,000
It has to be; you
can't really be him!

105
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,500
That tickles; you are
going to making me giggle!

106
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,916
[BRITAIN screams]

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hell yeah!

108
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,208
The hero gets one
in the win column!

109
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,333
[meow]
