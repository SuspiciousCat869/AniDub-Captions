No, my boss caught me
when I was leaving.

it was raw deal.

him some assistance?

It's reassuring to have you here

being blown up ass.

I mean, unless you asked me to.

Would you like for me
to make your gums bleed?

No, but thanks for the offer.

31
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,750
Why does he insist on being
spiteful whenever he sees me?

32
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:25,791
He's too cocky.

You think?

34
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,708
I consider the cocky to be
very good trait for having.

I don't know what you mean.

And how on Earth could you

40
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,750
consider cockiness
a "very good trait"?

41
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,166
The cock brings with it
free spirit and boldness

42
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,250
which probably stems
from being so young.

You and I are bound
by formalities,

have same burden.

Besides, if he
has too much pride,

take advantage, eh?
