1
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,250
[SEALAND]
Thank you for waiting!

2
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,958
I asked you both to
meet me here today

3
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,583
in order to make a terribly
important announcement.

4
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,791
Important announcement?

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,250
That's right! We're going
to find new group members!

6
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,291
And, Wy, I'd like to
thank you in particular

7
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,666
for coming to this meeting!

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,166
Whatever. I'm only here because

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,416
I finished popping all the
bubble wrap I had in my house,

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,708
so I had nothing else to do.

11
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,458
Wy, you're always so
funny in that way

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,666
which I find confusing, but
it's wonderful to see you, too!

13
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,416
Hey, I'm all about
having new members,

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,625
especially if we can get a
smokin' hot chick to sign up!

15
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,708
Just as we'd expect
from Seborga!

16
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,458
Hey Wy, do you have an opinion
regarding having new members?

17
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:59,125
Huh? I'm not sure
why you're asking me.

18
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,041
I-- Well, if they're
decent people,

19
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,833
I'd welcome them, most likely.

20
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,916
All right! Then let's
go find new members

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,291
of our treasure
box of countries!

22
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,750
I'll take a treasure box.

23
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,708
[SEALAND] Maybe I'll be able
to make a hundred friends!

24
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,041
[WY]
That's entirely unrealistic.

25
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,458
[NARRATOR] Thus, the
micro-nations' micro-adventure

26
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,583
to micro- search for more
micro-friends began.

27
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,333
[FRANCE]
If you don't raise my wages,

28
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:40,708
I'm going to go on strike!
Again! So there!

29
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,125
You wish to see him,
do you, children?

30
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,708
You better believe it, bungo,

31
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,916
because I've got proof there's
someone like us at your house,

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,125
so just produce what you've got.

33
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,583
Calm down, Sea!

34
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:52,375
Where is he? Introduce us to
him now, like immediately!

35
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,125
We just want to have more
members in our group.

36
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,958
Also, if you could
acknowledge me in public,

37
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,541
--that'd be super great.
--Have you tried organizing

38
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:58,958
--Why are you standing there?
--your thoughts before speaking?

39
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,291
Tell Germany, too.

40
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,875
If you go straight
down this road,

41
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,291
you'll be able to meet him, but
I can't promise he'll join you.

42
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,791
Thanks. We can at least try.

43
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,791
Please take care of him.

44
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,500
He's more than a
little sensitive

45
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,333
and more than a lot eccentric.

46
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,791
[SEALAND] On our way!
We're going straight!

47
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,125
[WY]
No, we're going cis!

48
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,125
Not that you don't normally
look happy, Sealand,

49
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,666
but today you are beaming.
What is that about?

50
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,958
I'm just looking forward to

51
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,083
getting to know our
new friends, that's all!

52
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,958
And, there might be someone
who's smaller than me,

53
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,375
if not in stature, then
at least in land area.

54
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,708
Oh, I get it, now.

55
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,583
[KUGELMUGEL] Can a
revolution be considered art,

56
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,250
and if so, why wouldn't
a baumkuchen be art?

57
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,875
And in that case, what about
a declaration of independence?

58
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,958
Ja, they are indeed art!

59
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,833
[screams]

60
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,041
For art!

61
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,208
[WY]
He doesn't look like someone

62
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,791
who does having
friends all that well.

63
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,541
[SEALAND]
I'm not usually so shy,

64
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,083
but I don't have the
goolies to go talk to him.

65
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,000
[SEBORGA]
We probably should let him be.

66
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,333
Ready to go?

67
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,208
[SEALAND] Yes, perhaps we
can catch him next time.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,125
[MOLOSSIA]
Ah, another fine day today!

69
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,750
Wow-bow, wow-bow,
wow-bow, wow!

70
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,500
[MOLOSSIA]
Yeah, you're telling me!

71
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,291
Feels good to tend a yard on
a day like this, doesn't it?

72
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,250
Yap-yip!

73
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,625
You're right, it is lunch time,

74
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,083
and I'm hungry, too.

75
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,708
[SEALAND, SEBORGA laugh]

76
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,666
[MOLOSSIA grunts]

77
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,958
You mind telling me why the hell

78
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,333
you jack wagons are
glaring in this direction?

79
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,541
His reaction seems excessive.

80
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,125
You can't just waltz
onto this land!

81
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,083
That's illegal!

82
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,041
[GROUP]
Ta-da!

83
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,208
[MOLOSSIA]
Molossian passports?

84
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,541
God damn it! You
entered legally?!

85
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,375
Forget what you saw, or I'm
gonna North Korea your asses!

86
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,916
Come on. I guess, I
can show you around.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,250
Move it or lose it, folks.

88
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,166
[WY] Seems to me that all
the other micronations

89
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,166
might be weird.

90
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,250
We wouldn't need
to be independent

91
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,416
if we weren't a little off.

92
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,375
Stop! If you move it,
you will lose it

93
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,333
because we didn't come all
this way for sightseeing!

94
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,875
What?!

95
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,500
Then pack all your crap up and
get the hell off of my lawn!

96
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,958
No, we can't do that.

97
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,958
We actually came here to ask
you to be friends with us,

98
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,375
and we can't exactly ask you
if we leave, now can we?

99
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,791
Me be friends with you?!

100
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,458
For the record, I don't
need any damn friends!

101
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,875
I'm fine just me and my dog,

102
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,291
so if you don't want
this super hair

103
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,833
to beat you within an
inch of your life,

104
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,125
you might want to go home!

105
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,375
Everyone knows I half
killed five cowboys

106
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,250
with daggers using
this magical mane.

107
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,666
And the last thing
I want to hear

108
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,583
is your crazy fantasies
about friendship on my land!

109
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,291
--Go away!
--His legs creep me out!

110
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,333
[SEALAND]
If he doesn't like us,

111
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,041
we can't do much
about it. Tally-ho!

112
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,041
[MOLOSSIA gasps]

113
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,375
Wait for me!

114
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,833
The air out here is so
full of nice moisture!

115
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,083
Hey, you got a problem--

116
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,875
[WY] Looks like we've
got another live one.

117
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,625
[SEALAND]
Onwards and upwards, I say.

118
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,541
And I've heard there's
yet another one like us

119
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,750
at our next stop!

120
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,375
Be the smokin' hottie
I dream of, please!

121
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,458
[SEALAND]
To be continued!
