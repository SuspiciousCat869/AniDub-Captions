Germany looks so
happy right now!

German ninja movies are

[SAMURAI 1A grunts]

19
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,041
Unlike in the movies, throwing
stars do not fly or stick.

20
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,583
It is highly unlikely that they
will even hit their target,

21
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,541
so they're rather
unreliable as a weapon.

00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:20,750
I was unaware
of this.

23
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,750
Sharpened chopsticks
are far more better

24
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,500
because you can throw
them with precision

25
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,958
and also they are good
for stabbing things.

Nein. Lies.

a coffee made from dandelions.
