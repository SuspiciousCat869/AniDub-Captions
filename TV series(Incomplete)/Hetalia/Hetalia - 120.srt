1
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:19,916
[ITALY] Oh yay!

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,708
I love it when we
get to go to Japan's!

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,083
Ja, just promise
to behave today.

4
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,791
First, I'm going to have a snack
and pet a calico kitty cat,

5
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,125
and then, after that,
I'll take a bath

6
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,458
and have another snack
or two, and then--!

7
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,333
[GERMANY] Will you shut it?

8
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,583
Japan, we have finally arrived.

9
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,333
[JAPAN] Oh, hello to you both.

10
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,625
Thank you very much for
travelling all this way

11
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,541
to attend this
meeting I am hosting.

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:41,666
[ITALY] Japan!

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,250
Ciao, Japan!
Ciao, Japan! Ciao, Japan!

14
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,750
[JAPAN] By all means,
please take a seat.

15
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:47,958
[ITALY] Taking!

16
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,000
Thank you, Japan, for
inviting us here today.

17
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,125
Germany and Italy,
I would like to offer

18
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,708
gratitude to both of you

19
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,500
for taking the time out of your
busy schedules to make it here.

20
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,458
I'm most humbly
delighted and honored.

21
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,916
Welcome to my home, gentlemen.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,291
Additionally, to celebrate
the one year anniversary

23
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,750
of the signing
of our alliance,

24
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,583
I have prepared a
modest little soiree

25
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,916
that will be held after
our scheduled meeting.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,791
It would be most appreciated
if you could attend.

27
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,250
[ITALY yells]

28
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,125
Come on! We're friends!
Stop being so formal, okay?

29
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,416
Apologies, Italy,
but at my place,

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,291
this is how we greet others;
it is proper manners.

31
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,666
Just let the poor man
finish his greeting!

32
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,708
This is my super
good friend, Japan.

33
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,875
Like his stereotype, he's
a very serious character.

34
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,958
I'm finding the main
problem is with the spring.

35
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,666
It makes a sound
like chika-chika.

36
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,958
Why don't you try
a chikaclanker?

37
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,833
A chika-clanker?
Perfect! Danke schoen!

38
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,000
[ITALY] Japan's not so
uptight with Germany,

39
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,208
like he gets to think
they're equals.

40
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,333
They even talk
about the hard stuff.

41
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,291
I don't know why neither
one of them are into

42
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,375
chitchat during a meeting.
Now, I must sing.

43
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,750
[ITALY and
the cat sing]

44
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,291
There is no singing
during science meetings!

45
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,750
Do you have something
to contribute?

46
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,416
[ITALY] There is another
thing that makes me think

47
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,041
Japan is too serious.

48
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,833
Oh, yeah, I don't
understand that.

49
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,333
[ITALY] When he
talks over my head.

50
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,041
Therefore, I think
it would be best

51
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,208
if we explained it
to Italy this way.

52
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,333
Nein, we should just
stick with my plan.

53
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,875
This way.

54
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,458
[ITALY] He holds a meeting to
discuss the best way to hold

55
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,958
the other meeting to make it
easy for me to understand.

56
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,166
Perhaps we should let
him decide which way

57
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,166
will help his comprehension
ability the most.

58
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,291
Italy, wake up!

59
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,125
[JAPAN] His brain
has made him tired.

60
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,583
[ITALY] All right! Bath time!

61
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,791
I've been looking forward
to this all day long!

62
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,208
Splish-splash! Splish-splash!

63
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,250
Looks like your energy has
returned at full force, Italy.

64
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,708
I heard both Japanese
Samurais and Grandpa Rome

65
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,000
loved the hot springs.

66
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,416
Seems like we have
a lot in common, huh?

67
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,000
It is also my understanding

68
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,750
that they were rather
fond of springs.

69
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,250
Grandpa Rome liked it best
when he drank his face off

70
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,000
while he was in the
hot spring water!

71
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,791
He'd drink again when
he got out, and then,

72
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,000
everyone would get ready for
the entertainment district

73
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,208
and manscape
like crazy!

74
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,125
Seriously?

75
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,875
Rome's place was
like that, too?

76
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,333
Are you seriously?

77
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,166
It's like they were
practically identical!

78
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,916
I guess, but those activities
weren't limited just to them.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,875
Oh, I forgot; I brought my
super secret samurai with me!

80
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,750
I'll show you, but
you can't tell anyone!

81
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,291
[JAPAN] How do you
have a samurai?

82
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:32,958
[ITALY] Zoom!

83
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,500
Where are
you going?

84
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,791
[ITALY] Look! Check out
my way cool samurai!

85
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,875
All right, what is all
this excitement about?

86
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,291
[GERMANY gasps]

87
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,750
Hey there,
Germany!

88
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,583
We were comparing
our samurai spirit,

89
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,875
so I thought I'd show him
what I was working with!

90
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,416
[FEMALE NARRATOR] His vest has
several pockets to let him carry

91
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,041
a lot of military goods.

92
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,833
Since it resembles
samurai armor,

93
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,916
it's referred to as a "samurai."

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,416
I don't know what's going
on and don't tell me.

95
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,000
Right there with you.

96
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,166
Here's to our
pact! Evviva!

97
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,125
--Kanpai.
--Prost.

98
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,916
Nicely put. I'll drink to that.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,833
No, Japan, you
can't drink this!

100
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,750
It's called alcohol, and it
will make you wastedy facedey.

101
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,125
You should wait to
drink until you're older.

102
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,791
You are much
younger than me.

103
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,833
You do realize that, right?

104
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,958
[ITALY] Get out!

105
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,250
Japan the Serious
made a funny!

106
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,416
Have some
juice, silly.

107
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,583
Oh.

108
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,250
[GERMANY] Japan is
unexpectedly amusing.

109
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,000
But I am telling you the truth!
