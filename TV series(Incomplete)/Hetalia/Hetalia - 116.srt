[KIDS] How Mont
Saint-Michel was created!

2
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,541
[FRANCE] One night, while
Bishop Aubert was sleeping,

3
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:28,083
the Archangel Michael
appeared in his dream.

4
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,375
[AUBERT] Huh? Oh...

5
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,083
[FRANCE] Michael
revealed to the Bishop

6
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,208
that he was to build
a church. However.

7
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,166
Crazy dream!

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,958
[FRANCE] Thinking
it was just a dream,

9
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,875
Bishop Aubert
ignored the message.

10
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,125
The next day.

11
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,416
The Archangel Michael
appeared to him again,

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,708
giving him the same
revelation. However.

13
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,708
Another crazy dream!

14
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,416
[FRANCE] He ignored
it once again,

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,125
thinking surely it
could not have been real.

16
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,833
But, on the third night.

17
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:03,583
Archangel Michael was not
so happy with the Bishop.

18
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,250
It was for real! Hahaha!

19
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,416
[FRANCE] He realized
the revelation was real

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,041
when he saw there was a
big hole in his forehead.

21
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,750
Oh hole!

22
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,750
Wait. A hole
in his forehead?

23
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:14,875
But how?

24
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,791
It is said the Archangel
poked a hole in it

25
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,083
with his finger.

26
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,750
Oh hole!

27
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,625
[KIDS] Top secret!

28
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:37,875

[SEYCHELLES] The wedding
ceremony for Britain's

00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,750
adorable prince is so amazing.

31
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,666
I want mine like that.

32
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,500
[phone rings]

33
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,541
This is Seychelles.

34
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,125
Britain, hi!

35
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,000
'Allo, I'm here!

36
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,875
Shh! You're far too loud.

37
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,000
What did you need?

38
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,375
Is something wrong?

39
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,291
I've a favor
to ask of you.

40
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,416
A favor?

41
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,375
Yes, the prince and
his new princess,

42
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,625
are wanting to go to your
place for their honeymoon.

43
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,916
Is that all right?

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,541
Oui, of course
it is all right!

45
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,125
I'm so much closer to France,

46
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,166
but Britain's still giving me
such a crucial historical role!

47
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,041
I, Seychelles, will make sure
they have a brilliant time!

48
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,958
Thank you, but do consider
our security concerns.

49
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,416
Keep it secret.
And keep it safe.

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,791
Secret, oui; might I at least
mutter to myself about it?

51
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,291
I suppose
that's fine.

52
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,916
[SEYCHELLES] The prince and
his wife are coming over!

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,291
The prince is coming
to Seychelles' house!

54
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,875
That is not muttering!

55
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,208
[KIDS] So much
for top secret!

56
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,208
Whoopsie!

[KIDS] How to
make Cardboartain!

58
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:44,458
[FEMALE NARRATOR] First, write
"Britain" on a cardboard box.

59
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,291
Then, sneak up to the victim

60
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,916
while doing your best
not to be seen.

61
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,208
Completed!

62
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,458
Cardboartain.

63
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,666
A British-like creature
made of a cardboard box.

64
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,166
Created by Sweden
in three minutes.

65
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,583
Please do not shake contents
of Cardboartain, and do not

66
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,208
drive, cook, or operate
heavy machinery while inside.

67
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,625
[SEALAND] Stop doing that!

68
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,208
[FEMALE NARRATOR]
Silly Cardboartain.

69
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,083
You watch too
much of the TV.

70
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,708
[SEALAND] Whatever, butt head!

71
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,083
He should play with
me more, instead.

72
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,416
I'd really rather
not get involved.

73
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,541
[KIDS] What Italy
left behind!

74
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,541
[FEMALE NARRATOR]
The time was World War One,

75
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,875
when not too far outside
of the Italian front.

76
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,500
[GERMAN SOLDIER 16A]
Germany, sir!

77
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,833
Look at this!

78
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,125
Italy dropped it.

79
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,708
It seems he left
a lot of guns behind.

80
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,166
All of these pistolen
are brand new!

81
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,791
What is wrong
with that fool?

82
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,916
So this is
Italy's gun, huh?

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,791
I think I must spend some
time investigating it.

84
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:39,625
Hey, there!

85
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,500
This is my gun's
cool manual!

86
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,166
You might like girls
more than guns,

87
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,666
but you can still
shoot things!

88
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,666
Have fun!

89
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,250
What kind of
manual is this?

90
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,583
It's not professional, at all!

91
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,791
Let's see.

92
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,958
My gun is cool
and groundbreaking!

93
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,625
One side of it can be
cracked open like this, see.

94
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,916
That makes
cleaning super easy!

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,041
He's right. Very convenient.

96
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,791
Oh, but because
of that neat part,

97
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,083
if you put the normal,
powerful bullets in,

98
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,083
the impact will cause it
to break--so don't do that!

99
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,208
[GERMANY] Huh?

100
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,083
No strong bullets!

101
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,458
Wait. What else
is there?

102
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,875
Don't stress out!

103
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,833
In order to make it safe,
I special-ordered

104
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,625
nicer bullets that
don't pressure you.

105
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,333
It's what you call perfetto!

106
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:24,291
So basically, he chose the
ease of cleaning over power?

107
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,708
Oh, Italy.

108
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,458
Whether he's a friend or a foe,
he's a cause for worry.

109
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,333
[GERMAN SOLDIER 16A] Ja.

110
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,250
I love pasta!
