1
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:17,750
This is from me!

2
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,375
For the Valentine's day!

3
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,625
[JAPAN] Germany mistook Italy's
feelings for him as love.

4
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,958
So, he began reading a
book conveniently titled:

5
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,916
"The Beginner's Guide
to Relationships:

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,166
for the Hard-Hearted
German." And, then.

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,791
Do you maybe want to
go to dinner tonight?

8
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,833
Okay, yeah.
Sounds good to me!

9
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,083
What's going on?

10
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,166
You've been unusually
nice to me recently.

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,541
Not complaining.

12
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,541
[JAPAN]
Germany decided to respond

13
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,083
to Italy's confession of love.

14
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,666
[GERMANY]
Now that I think on it.

15
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,375
With the exception of mein own
family, I'm used to being hated.

16
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:14,208
My life has been a long series
of fights and suspicions.

17
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,083
That is until now.

18
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,333
[ITALY] Germany! Germany!

19
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,833
[GERMANY] Ja, he annoys
the scheisse out of me,

20
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,208
but he can be fun
to be around, too.

21
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:27,500
Maybe? And, if I'm being honest.
He has a very nice climate.

22
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,875
Perhaps I should think it over.

23
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,041
What the hell is wrong
with you, Germany?

24
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,000
[ITALY laughs]

25
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,375
Oh. Italy. You are here.

26
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,000
Yep. Lookie. Lucky me!

27
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,875
What?
You Scheißkerl!

28
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,750
Um. Okay, I'm sorry!

29
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,250
Seriously, what is
wrong with you?

30
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,500
Inappropriate doesn't even
begin to--I was right there!

31
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,125
[ITALY] All right?

32
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,875
I am more than aware
of your "habits."

33
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,916
[ITALY] I don't understand
why I'm in trouble with him

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,833
when we just got together.

35
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:57,250
Maybe it's because I bailed on
jogging to go get pizza instead.

36
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,916
Who can turn down pizza?

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,791
Oh, or maybe he found out I
drew pictures on the tanks.

38
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,916
I don't know.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,166
Everything I do
makes him mad.

40
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,000
[ITALY] I'm sorry, Germany.

41
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,375
[GERMANY sighs]

42
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,166
I'm glad you understand.

43
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,791
Mi scusi!
Can we get some menus?

44
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,000
[GERMANY] Oh, yes.

45
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,041
There're some things
I want to give to you.

46
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,875
Although, I doubt
you'll like them.

47
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,416
[ITALY] Ah--Heliotropes?

48
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,375
You seem to enjoy
Greek mythology,

49
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:27,041
so I got them for you because I
heard they show up there a lot.

50
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,291
Wow, thank you.

51
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,750
But why are you giving
me flowers Germany?

52
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:31,291
It's weird.

53
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,916
Uh... Ahh!

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,458
No, no, I didn't mean
weird like that.

55
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,875
I meant it's not
Germany's style;

56
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,791
he's not big on fun
and spontaneity.

57
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,041
Oh. I still have
another gift for you.

58
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,500
[ITALY] Huh?

59
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,333
[GERMANY] I asked them to
make it into a tomato shape

60
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,375
since that seems
to be your thing.

61
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,041
Ahh!

62
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,458
Ahhh!

63
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,458
Ah. Wait. No, you've
got it all wrong;

64
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,375
I swear to you, this
doesn't mean anything!

65
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,500
[GERMANY sighs]

66
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,833
[GERMANY] From the
flowers to the ring.

67
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:57,250
I went through all the
steps the book suggested.

68
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,750
All that remains is the climax.

69
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,333
Hey, Germany.

70
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,708
Is this a good time to say I'm
sorry for drawing on the tanks?

71
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,125
[GERMANY] Ah! Italy!

72
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,500
Ahhh!

73
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:11,208
I said I was sorry! Ahhh!

74
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,875
[HUNGARY laughs]

75
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,916
Seems like you found
an interesting book

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,416
or something
completely random.

77
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,125
Hey, would you mind putting
some jam on my cake for me?

78
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,500
And yes, this book
"The Beginner's Guide

79
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,541
to Relationships: for the Hard
Hearted German" tells the reader

80
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,708
how to do things from
dating to a proposal,

81
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,541
but it's all
unbelievably crazy town.

82
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,666
So. When you say crazy, do
you mean like it is funny?

83
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,000
[HUNGARY] Oh, yes,
it's hilarious!

84
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,416
The funniest part was about
the marriage proposal.

85
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,916
Ahhh!

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,583
[HUNGARY] If someone
proposed to me like that,

87
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,916
I'd probably laugh so hard
I'd end up passing out,

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,791
or peeing my pants, or both.

89
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,333
Hey, uh, so,
uh, Germany?

90
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,916
Huh? Oh--

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,625
You there, Germany? Hello?

92
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,458
Germany? Germany?

93
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,750
Are you okay?

94
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,666
Achtung! Get it together;
we are getting behind.

95
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,750
Ja, but-- I still am not sure

96
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,583
where I'm supposed to
be storing all these.

97
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,958
You are a loser!

98
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,458
Does anyone else have an
idea where we can put them?

99
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,250
Nein! Run away!

100
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,333
[yelling]

101
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,500
What's the matter
with you, Germany?

102
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,375
You're burning.
That's not healthy.

103
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,333
[JAPAN] It is said that
it took about a week

104
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,375
for Germany's misunderstanding
to be cleared up.

105
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,333
What do we do with him?
