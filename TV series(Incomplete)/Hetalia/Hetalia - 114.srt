[AUSTRIA] Whenever I carpool
with you to the conference,

2
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,000
I get here
exceedingly early.

3
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:28,375
I have autobahns but your
speed puts them to shame.

4
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,625
Drive yourself.

5
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,500
It is wonderful
to see you both.

Ohayo gozaimasu.

7
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,416
And a good morning
to you, Japan.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,333
We get to this meeting in
the same order every time.

9
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,916
Switzerland should be here
already, ignoring everyone else.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,041
So we know who'll
be next to arrive.

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,166
Look!
The Netherlands!

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,541
What? Do you envy my scarf?

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,541
[CHINA] I got here early
and I'm older than I look!

14
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,416
You lazy capitalist should
learn from my example!

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,750
Yes, well, at least
our smog isn't tangible.

16
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,041
[CHINA] Lead way, you
imperialist pig-dogs!

17
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,458
[FEMALE NARRATOR]
Okay, quiz time.

18
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,000
What are those numbers
above their heads about?

[GROUP chatters]

20
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,125
[FEMALE NARRATOR] According
to the dumbest survey ever,

21
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,708
it's the order of
average walking speed.

22
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:18,500
[CHINA] Hey!

23
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,708
You're young!

24
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,666
Why you walk so slow,
like you old woman?

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,458
Step up your game!

26
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,833
That's how I walk.

27
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,833
I'll try to hurry.

28
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,750
[FEMALE NARRATOR] Germany
blitzkriegs the sidewalk

29
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:32,041
at 5th place, but Austria
putters along at 23rd.

30
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,208
Weird for being neighbors, huh?

31
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,833
So much walking.

32
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,958
I'm exhausted, Germany!

33
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,833
Maybe we could take a break?

34
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:40,958
Already?

35
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,333
But you've only walked,
like, forty feet!

36
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:44,625
I hate to ask,

37
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,500
but if you got on your
hands and knees for me,

38
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:47,708
that'd be
a big help.

39
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,041
[GERMANY] Huh?

40
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,583
Having you that way would
give me a second wind.

41
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,458
What sort of
kinky are you?

42
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,583
There's nothing kinky
about it, I swear!

43
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:57,250
I'm begging you!
Hands and knees!

44
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,541
[GERMANY] All right.

45

Check it out.

51
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,708
People go nuts for
a man in uniform,

52
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,250
especially when he kicks
a leg up on a chair.

53

all the boys.

It's hard to believe
they're actually brothers.

60
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:52,041
The way they are rolling
is nothing alike y'know?

61
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,208
Usually the younger
brother is the screwball,

62
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,541
but Germany has
his bok together.

63
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,500
Maybe they're
different on the surface.

64
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,250
But when it
comes to clothes,

65
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,416
they share an
anal-retentive streak.

66

Ha, ha! You just
said "anal"!

more suspicious?

With a Jeep and
American clothes,

you should be able to waltz
