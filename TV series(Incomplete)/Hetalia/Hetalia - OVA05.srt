1
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,458
[GIRL AMERICA] Hey! Um, hello!

2
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,625
Wake up or else, Estonia!

3
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,125
What the crap do you
think you're doing?

4
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:43,541
I was totally talking and then,
you just fell asleep, ya douche!

5
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,541
[ESTONIA] When I woke up,
everyone but me had become--

6
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,583
Whaaaat?!

7
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:59,916
[GIRL ITALY] Who's prettier,
me or Mamma?

8
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,916
[GIRL GERMANY] I am
completely surrounded

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,166
by high-maintenance people.

10
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,708
[GIRL JAPAN] How--
How regrettable!

11
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,208
[GIRL AMERICA] I'm the heroine!

12
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,291
Don't do drugs, kids.

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,166
[GIRL BRITAIN] It's not
that I'm isolated.

14
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,916
I just choose to be
alone, that's all.

15
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,291
[GIRL FRANCE] What is
the purpose of living

16
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,708
if you don't have style?

17
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,791
[GIRL CHINA] If Kongming
said it, it must be true.

18
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,875
[GIRL RUSSIA] No such
service exists in Russia.

19
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:55,416
[GIRL LATVIA] I'm nervous.
I'm trembling.

20
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,375
[GIRL CANADA] The capital city
of Canada is Ottawa, eh?

21
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,000
[GIRL PRUSSIA] Hey, bro-haus!

22
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,875
I am still awesome;
but also I am hot!

23
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,041
[ESTONIA stammers]

24
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,208
[ESTONIA]
America? Is that you?

25
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,166
[GIRL BRITAIN] Stop it, America.

26
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,958
You cannot solve all of your
problems by hitting them.

27
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,458
Britain, too? Oh, wow.

28
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,750
Estonia. This is your
fault for falling asleep.

29
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,166
[GIRL JAPAN]
Maybe don't use the bat

30
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,958
and try settling
things peacefully?

31
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,666
I am very certain Estonia
meant no insult to you.

32
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,000
[ESTONIA] This girl is Japan?

33
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,750
And that must be Latvia?
What the heck is going?

34
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,375
Everyone except me
turned into girls

35
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,625
like ones in those dating sims!

36
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,500
[ESTONIA sobs]

37
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,875
[GIRL ITALY] So you fell asleep.

38
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,250
But what can you do, right?

39
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,458
Issa only human.

40
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,000
[ESTONIA] Ah! Italy?

41
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,500
Once we're done
with this meeting,

42
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,250
I think we should eat something
and take a nice, long nap!

43
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,833
Why strong?

44
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,666
Hey, why do you have to cause
all of this drama anyway, huh?

45
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,875
You should try to
be much more nicer!

46
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,583
Don't telling me.

47
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,958
What, you mean me?

48
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,000
[ESTONIA] No way.
It's an estrogen Russia!

49
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,541
All I did was brush a
little honey on Estonia

50
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,875
and abandon
him outside.

51
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,791
[ESTONIA] Classic.

52
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,041
[GIRL CHINA] Estonia!

53
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,333
I got real good
medicine at my place!

54
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,625
You buy from me!

55
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,291
Then you be so happy and
I can be so happy, too!

56
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,333
Why this is happening?

57
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,791
Perhaps I can shed some
light on the situation.

58
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,958
[ESTONIA] That's a pretty
suspicious-looking God;

59
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,333
I bet Miss Hungary is
instigating some of this, too!

60
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,083
[GOD] You seemed
less than fortunate,

61
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,916
so I went ahead and took
care of one of your wishes.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,708
Look around. It's your
fantasy come true!

63
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,625
What are you talking about,
this isn't my fantasy!

64
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:52,125
[GOD] Enjoy. It's
your turn to be happy.

65
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,583
I did this for you!

66
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,541
[GIRLS giggle]

67
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,625
[ESTONIA] Ahh!

68
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,166
[GOD] Your life is
now exhilaratin'.

69
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,916
You are surrounded
by the ladies!

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,541
[GIRLS] Estonia!

71
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,708
[ESTONIA] I don't want to
be exhilarated like this!

72
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,916
Ahhh!

73
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,958
What the--?

74
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,083
Estonia?

75
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,833
You are looking like you had
bad dream or something, yes?

76
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,541
Oh good. It was nightmare.

77
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,208
[RUSSIA] Hmm. What
kind of nightmare?

78
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,416
Well, it uh--
Everyone.

79
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,083
That is, everyone except
me had turned into a girl.

80
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,375
I like that story.

81
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,625
Cool dream!
