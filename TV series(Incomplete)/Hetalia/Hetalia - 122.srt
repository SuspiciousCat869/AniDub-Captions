[GERMANY]
Hm?

00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,666
Japan, what is that
on top of your rice?

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,291
Ah... This is my
delicious canned beef.

4
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,250
What? You're eating canned beef?

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm eating canned beef, too!

6
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,791
Why are you having
to that eat today?

7
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,625
I expected more pasta.

8
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,833
Either way, it's Italian,
so it's bound to be delicious.

9
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,125
--[ITALY] Uh...
--[BOTH] Huh?

10
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,791
I'm sure they used normal,
yummy beef for this,

11
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,375
but it tastes like
the cow flesh was in

12
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,791
some weird chemical reaction
at the manufacturing factory.

13
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,208
[groans] Our military
canned food tastes like

14
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,125
maggots might have been eating
it, but not in a good way.

15
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,125
[GERMANY]
Italy...

16
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,875
Would you like some chocolate?

17
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,208
[ITALY]
Yeah...

18
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,958
[JAPAN] Would you like
delicious canned mackerel?

19
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,166
[ITALY]
Yeah...

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,625
This is molto bene!

21
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,833
My Yamato-ni beef
is delicious, too.

22
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,541
[ITALY]
Grazie.

23
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,333
Once upon a time, you
weren't supposed to think

24
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:09,000
your food was tasty or that
would be considered a big sin.

25
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,333
Talk about a living hell.

26
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:12,916
What?! "Delicious"
was forbidden?

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,791
But why?!

28
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,166
Delicious things are wonderful!

29
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,833
[ITALY]
That's what I said!

30
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,583
Wow! They just went old
school, reminiscing on us.

31
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,125
I remember those days...

32
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,916
[DEVIL BOSS] Back then,
I was completely overflowing

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,750
with all those people,
which forced us to work 24/7.

34
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,833
Talk about a living hell,
but literal!

35
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:44,666
[JAPAN]
Mister Germany, look.

36
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,208
I made these based
on the biscuits

37
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,833
you taught me how to
make that one time.

38
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,625
[GERMANY]
Really? My recipe?

39
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,416
I tweaked it a little and
made it for our military.

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,583
It's hardtack. I don't
know if you'll like it.

41
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,083
Whoa!

42
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,041
I wish I could have seen Germany
teaching you how to cook.

43
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:58,833
Nein.

44
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:00,666
I wanna try some hardtack!

45
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,125
All right... But it
may taste plain.

46
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,791
Well, food on the
battlefield is usually plain.

47
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,000
That's true.

48
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,833
Hey, you can use this, though!

49
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:12,291
This is called Vegemite;
Australia dropped it.

50
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,083
Italy! You can eat
anything but that,

51
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,916
it will be too much
for you to handle!

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,833
[BRITAIN]
Boing.

53
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,750
Hardtack is mild
and easy to eat.

54
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,541
Ja...

55
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,458
So this is Vegemite, huh?

56
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,833
[GROUP chattering]

57
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,208
What the bollocks do
they look so happy for?

58
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,708
[NARRATOR] Since they
had to carry their food

59
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,083
around with them during the war,

60
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,125
both the Allies and Axis
Powers tried to develop food

61
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,333
whose quality wouldn't change
in harsh environments,

62
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,625
such as deserts and the tropics.

63
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,916
We have potatoes...
But how to cook them?

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,958
Konpeito! Salmon! Hardtack!

65
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,958
Let's just put
everything in a can!

66
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,708
Dude, I know we thought
this old canned food

67
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,791
might still be good, but so
far, everything tastes like

68
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,500
we're licking the wrinkles out
of a buffalo's salty satchel.

69
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,958
My body rejects it,

70
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,958
and tears are coming out of
my eyes all on their own.

71
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,166
Probably not our
smartest endeavor.

72
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,041
We're almost done; we can
do it! The last food is...

73
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,291
...the fruitcake stored in
Colonel Taylor's basement

74
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,041
for over one hundredish years!

75
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,333
[BRITAIN] Are you taking
the piss, America?!

76
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,083
After all the nastiness
we've put in our bodies,

77
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,291
why save the worst for last?!

78
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,250
I don't think we can
digest food that old!

79
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,000
[BRITAIN]
Oh? It's edible.

80
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,166

Granted we are on
the battlefield,

84
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,458
but do you think you'll
be okay eating all that?

85
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,125
What? This is normal.

86
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,458
There is nothing normal
about that amount!

[BRITAIN] Oh! Are you
sure about that?

Duh.

I don't want it, then! Rude!

Actually, you ninny,

it's a gentlemen's habit to have
tea every day at a set time.

I drink coffee, not tea!

Whether on the battlefield or
simply drinking tea at home,

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,666
having a lovely, strong cuppa

always makes me feel
gentlemanly and oh-so-calm.

One cannot call
themselves an adult
