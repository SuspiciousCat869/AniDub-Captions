So, the letter eight
is the letter chi.

328
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,656
‐And so 29 is ya.
‐And 42 is shi,

329
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,491
and if you say
them all backwards

330
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,660
you come up with, "Shi‐ya‐chi."

Shi‐ya‐chi, the Shachihoko

on the roof of the castle!

333
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,708
And so now you know
the answer to the riddle.

334
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,127
But there are two Shachis
on the roof, so which one

335
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,129
of them actually holds
the hidden treasure?

you let him outta there.

which way are the
hands pointing?
