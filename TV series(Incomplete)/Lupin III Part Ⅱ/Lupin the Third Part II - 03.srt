Yeah, and I've seen this guy.

172
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,774
In here, I think.

173
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,820
Yeah, look at this.

174
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,739
Medical student named Oz.

175
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,740
Big Nessie nut.

176
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,325
Missing since a disastrous
search 30 years ago.

177
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:59,164
Subtract hair,
add 30 years and bingo!

(evil laughter)

179
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,543
Why in the world
are you doing this?

180
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,046
A long time ago when
I was about your age,

181
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,715
a local distillery offered
100 million pounds

182
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,510
to anyone who could provide
proof of Nessie's existence.

183
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,678
I know, I read about it.

184
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,139
No one cashed in and
the offer expired, right?

185
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,726
Correct, but it turned out to be
a blessing in disguise, my dear.

186
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,144
(squeaking)

187
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,855
Certain other parties
approached me shortly thereafter

188
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,191
and offered
to double the amount.

189
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,359
But there was a catch.

190
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,362
Nessie would have to be
captured for display.

191
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,407
The profits would
be astronomical.

192
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,786
And your voice
is the key to it all!

193
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,079
No way, you're crazy!

depended on it.
