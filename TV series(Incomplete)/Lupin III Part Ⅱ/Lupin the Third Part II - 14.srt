old foot fungus here

Mr. Lupin will
certainly be joining us.

was satisfactory.

‐Yeah!

196

This monocle is a
polarizing lens, gentlemen.

197

It completely obscures the
brilliancy of the gem.

what happens if Lupin
manages to find it in there?

Ja, good point, Inspector.

Did you just say
what I think you said?

Lupin has only until midnight
to steal this treasure.
