from about 9:30 to

Mr. Queen was all
alone in his study.

378

Madam, you retired to your
bedroom on the third floor

379
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,922
directly above this
room at 10 o'clock,

380
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,799
if I'm not mistaken, and George,

381
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,217
according to what
you've told me,

382
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,011
you left the house at
just about that same time,

383
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,221
but then you walked
through the yard

384
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,056
and across to the
window of the study.

385
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,600
You threw a stone
up at the window.

386
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,186
Hearing a noise, Mr.
Queen came to the window,

387
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,189
opened it and leaned
forward to look around.

388
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,440
Snagged from directly above,

389
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,401
Mr. Queen's body was
then lowered to the ground

390
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,696
with the very same rope
that was used to choke him.

391
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,614
Then you hoisted him on the tree

392
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,866
to make the whole thing
look like a suicide.

393
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,202
Now, if he'd already
managed to hide Solomon's Eye

394
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,787
by the time you lured
him to the window,

395
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,163
you would've been stuck.

396
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,957
So, when you snuck
into the study

397
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,167
and noticed the football
had been tampered with,

398
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,586
it was a double relief.

399
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,379
Knowing the ball was
meant to be presented

400
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,922
to the winning
team after the game,

401
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,341
you knew you'd be able to
get your hands on the sapphire

402
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,343
after the presentation ceremony.

403
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,428
That's crazy!

404
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,680
And you can't prove any
of it, you little freak!

405
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,098
Hmm, can't I?

406
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,143
George is right, this is all
just pure delusion, Detective.

407
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,228
You've absolutely
no proof at all.

408
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,647
Hmm, well how about
this will I discovered

409
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,065
hidden in Mr. Queen's study?

410
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,067
I'm not a lawyer, but if
I'm reading it correctly,

411
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,653
it says that all his assets,
including Solomon's Eye,

412
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,989
are to go to the Red
Eagles after his death.

413
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,576
So, that would suggest at least
a considerable profit motive

414
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,869
for somebody here.

415
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,455
As long as you had Lupin
lurking about as a scapegoat,

416
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,665
the suspicion would
naturally turn to him,

417
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,584
but one little thing went wrong.

418
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,086
It always does‐‐I coulda
warned you about that.

419
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,422
Soon after you hung him from
the tree, the rope snapped,

420
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,592
and somehow he miraculously
survived the whole thing!

small piece of the rope
