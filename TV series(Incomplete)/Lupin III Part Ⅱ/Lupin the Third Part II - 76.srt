The oppression of the black

an ongoing crime
against humanity.

63

The brave people

establish a government

in exile somewhere in Europe.

69
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,925
Long‐term, the plan would be
to help that new government

70
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,261
negotiate for an
independent state.

That all sounds good.

72
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,223
However, at the moment,
this country still has

diplomatic relations
with Borodias,

74
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,394

From there, we'll assume
all responsibility

look to me to lead them.

167
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,168

just a hospital,

168
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,086
it's our movement's
last stronghold.

169
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:09,007
It's an important symbol, and
the army is ready to invade.

170

As it is, we don't
have near the means

will die and go unburied,

end of all hope.

Doctor, if you
trust me, listen.

183
