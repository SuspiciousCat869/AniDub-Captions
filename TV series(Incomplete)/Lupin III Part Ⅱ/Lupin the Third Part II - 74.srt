my name is Mumba, I'm
a scientist, you see,

233

A what formula?

235
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,511
Surely you're aware that
South Africa practices

236
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,513
a strict form of
racial discrimination.

237

transportation everywhere,

241
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,440
black people are
segregated from white people.

unbearable way to live,

one's own country.

Then one day,
I had an inspiration.

245
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,740
What if people could
alter their skin color

246
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,700
as easily as
certain animals do?

I buried myself in
research day and night.

248
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,830
Eventually, I isolated
a certain compound

249
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,290
that's secreted
by chameleons,

250
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,960
and from that I was able
to develop a formula

251
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,462
that mimicked a
chameleon's ability.

252
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:38,841
Then I applied it to fabric
with the same result.

253
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,220
Look, the skin
of a chameleon.
