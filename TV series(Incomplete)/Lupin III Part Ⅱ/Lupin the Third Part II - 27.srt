I'll be back for it.

500
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,624
So keep it
somewhere safe for me

501
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,210
and I'll be seeing ya.

502
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,963
Your friend, Lupin the Third."

She may be a geeky
four‐eyed freakazoid,

507
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,729
but this rookie
cop's got game.

508
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,063
And she takes it right to us

509
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,024
after we pull a
big job in Paris.

510
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,902
Not much of a team player
as poor Pops finds out.

511
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,069
But take it from me,

512
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,697
her one‐on‐one moves
are a revelation.

513
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:29,867
Catch ya later in
"Revenge of Le Nerd."
