Inspector Zenigata, Interpol.

175
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,254
I believe we spoke
earlier this morning.

176
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,049
Thank you very much
for coming.

177
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,176
I'd have understood
if you declined.

178
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,178
I must imagine
you're not too happy

179
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,429
about this stunt either.

180
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,473
I can assure you,
that's putting it

181
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,433
most mildly, Inspector.

182
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,811
(Marukin laughing)

183
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,481
Oh, you have nothing
to worry about.

184
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,066
(groans)

185
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,443
I want you to arrest
this man, Inspector!

186
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,736
He's an accessory!

187
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,862
Accessory to what?

188
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,364
There's not going
to be any crime

189
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,908
committed here,
you know that.

190
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,035
I don't,
nobody does anymore.

191
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,787
That's why the board
has just instructed me

192
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,664
to inform you that
we're canceling our

193
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,708
long‐term agreement
with your company.

(laughing)

195
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,963
It'll just be more expensive
when you come back to me.

196
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,340
In exactly 10 minutes
from now that safe

197
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,175
is going to open
automatically.

198
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,969
And when the world
learns I foiled

199
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,303
the great Lupin the Third,

200
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,639
my factories will
be working overtime.

201
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,184
Unfortunately, the safe's
already been opened.

202
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,561
Sometime this morning.

203
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,729
That's impossible!

204
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,480
Maybe it just opened
a little early?

205
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,982
No, I'm afraid not.

206
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,526
We checked, the safe
was definitely forced open,

207
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,446
and the contents were
meticulously removed.

208
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,615
It was my masterpiece.

209
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,326
It was the most advanced
design in the world.

210
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,203
The code, the materials.

211
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,496
Impregnable.

212
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,999
I poured my very soul
into that project,

213
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,751
designing and redesigning,

214
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,627
obsessing over
every detail!

215
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,629
And now the fruit
of all that labor has

216
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,007
been laid to waste
by a common thief!

217
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,177
Well, there's a lot of
things you can call Lupin.

218
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,720
He's a thief,
and a womanizer,

219
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,804
and a bastard,

220
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,347
but he is not common.

221
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,892
No, he's one‐of‐a‐kind.

222
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,727
It sounds like
you admire him.

Show me the safe, I insist.

Come on, show me!

00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,212
you brought it on yourself.

237

To say nothing of the
damage you've done to us,

238
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,800
challenging Lupin was
an arrogant, desperate,

239
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,218
irresponsible stunt.

240
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,928
On the other hand,
it's no shame to be

241

Go ahead, ask me anything.

336
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,034
Thank you.

337
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,621
I mean, it's just,
was there a reason

338
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,790
you targeted my dad's safes?

339
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,791
A reason?

340
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,043
Not really.

341
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,044
No reason?

342
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,464
Hey, turn it down!

343
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,506
That's hot!

344
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,632
Tell me.

345
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,759
Tell you?

346
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,844
(Lupin groans)

347
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,012
Cut it out!

348
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,138
Why him?

349
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,139
I‐‐I don't‐‐

350
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,640
Look, they're the best, right?

351
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,641
I mean, come on.

352
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,603
I just wanted to...

353
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:14,437
Wanted to what?

354
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,564
Test your skills
or something?

355
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,149
Yes.

356
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,817
Sort of a game to you?

357
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,152
Yeah, I mean, no.

358
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,153
I mean, whatever.

359
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,696
Well, while you were
testing your skills,

360
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,407
my family was suffering
devastation and shame.

361
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,868
(Lupin straining)

362
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,995
Oh, stop it,
turn it off, please!

363
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,997
And then when you
couldn't beat my father

364
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,832
fair and square,
you cheated!

365
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,958
Hah, yeah.

366
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,877
Well, I could've broken
into that safe blindfolded,

367
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,920
and I didn't.

368
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,004
And you wanna know why?

369
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,672
It was out of
compassion for your father!

370
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,800
That's a desperate lie.

371
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,095
You don't care about
anyone but yourself.

372
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,513
(Lupin screams)

373
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,472
Hot, hot, hot!

374
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,140
Cut it out, will you?

375
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,600
Okay, you're mad, I get it.

376
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,477
What do you want
from me, an apology?

377
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,521
I want you to accept
a challenge from me.

378
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,730
No tricks this time.

379
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,648
From you?

380
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,191
That's ridiculous,
you're like 12.

381
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,526
What are you gonna
challenge me to?

382
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,693
A game of Frogger?

383
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,571
The challenge is to break
into a safe I've created.

384
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,532
You created?

385
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,616
(laughs)

386
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,700
You're joking, right?

387
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,328
I mean, come on,
that's just plain silly.

388
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,124
(Lupin whimpers)

389
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,251
I'm sorry, was that
a yes or a no?

390
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,378
That was a desperate
cry for help by a man

391
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,171
being attacked by a fetus.

392
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,215
Yes or no, Mr. Lupin?

393
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,717
Just turn it down!

394
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,389
Okay, do we have
an agreement?

395
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,516
Just a little lower,
if you don't mind.

396
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,270
Phew.

397
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,230
I take it that signals
your acceptance.

398
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,566
‐I won't do it!
‐Huh?

399
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,650
(chuckles)

400
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,026
Have it your way, then.

401
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,655
Whoa!

402
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,073
(straining)

403
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,992
You're a tough man, Mr. Lupin.

404
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,535
Maybe a little
tenderizing

405
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,787
will bring you
to your senses.

406
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,248
(shrieking)

407
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,419
So, all of this is
just to avenge

408
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,337
your father's honor,
is that right?

409
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,339
A noble instinct,
but I'm afraid

410
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,632
you're overmatched.

411
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,763
You're a sweet kid,
but shouldn't you

412
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,764
be in school?

413
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,641
You're gonna fall
behind in geometry.

414
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,602
Huh, the son
of a great man

415
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,228
is always underestimated.

416
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,275
Take a look at my
latest design.

417
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,610
A handcuff safe.

418
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,195
Very imaginative.

419
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,779
You really are
your father's son,

420
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,616
but it still doesn't
make you a match for Lupin.

421
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,451
Hey, Fujiko, could you
get the darts out

422
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,827
of the board for me?

423
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,787
Lazy.

424
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,747
(gasps)

425
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:38,998
What are you doing, Junior?

426
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,082
Get these things off.

427
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,084
There are only
two ways out of them.

428
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,795
You can use the key
or just cut off your hands.

429
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,589
Very funny,
you're a riot.

430
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,673
Now, give me the key.

431
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,885
Unfortunately, it's not
in my possession just now.

432
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,178
Hey, cut the crap, kid,

433
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,471
and get those
cuffs off of her,

434
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,806
and get 'em off of her
right now or else.

435
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,893
But even I can't remove
them without the key.

436
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,103
Please, get these
things off now!

437
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,897
Where the hell's
the key, Junior?

438
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,982
Locked inside the safe I made.

439
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:05,983
You bastard!

440
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,318
So that's how you're
gonna get Lupin

441
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,819
to accept your
little challenge?

442
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,572
So, Fujiko, how attached
are you to those hands?

443
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,698
(ceramic shatters)

444
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,116
Don't even joke
about that.

445
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,787
Since when did you develop
a sense of humor anyway?

446
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:18,746
Well, all right.

447
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,249
It was just a thought.

448
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,334
And as for you...

449
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,752
prepare yourself.

450
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,753
It's time.

451
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,507
Goemon, forget it.

452
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,008
Lupin, what happened?

453
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,134
You look terrible.

454
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,219
Man, are you all right?

455
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,679
I've had more
relaxing saunas,

456
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,889
but yeah, I'll be okay.

457
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,895
Looks like you have us
over a barrel, Tetsutaroo.

458
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,940
You're a pretty
determined guy.

459
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,733
Right on both points.

460
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,860
And so?

461
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,529
Well...

462
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,655
I'm the same way.

463
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,781
The more cornered I feel,

464
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,700
the harder
I fight to escape.

465
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,951
(gulps)

466
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,704
But like you said,
I have you over a barrel.

467
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,872
Actually, I just said
it looks like you have

468
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,957
us over a barrel.

469
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,584
And looks can be deceiving.

470
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,793
Oh, please, Lupin.

471
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,045
Don't turn this into
some kind of a macho thing.

472
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,714
This kid's just not worth it.

473
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,549
Ah, patience now,
sweetheart.

474
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,925
Come here.

475
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,386
Okay, somebody start timing me.

476
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,054
Let's see now.

477
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,097
A hairpin?

478
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,890
What do you take me for?

479
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,517
Don't make me answer that.

480
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,185
(laughs)

481
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,478
Hmm.

482
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,564
♪

483
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,357
Is there something wrong?

484
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,734
Don't worry, little lady.

485
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,402
I'll have you
out in a jiffy.

486
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,445
Heh‐heh.

487
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,071
Hmm.

488
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:39,577

489

You need a hand or anything?

490

Nah, nah, you kidding?

491
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,914
A piece of cake, actually.

492
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,375
I just felt more
like donuts today.

Phew, nothing like
a tall glass of juice

after a near‐fatal sauna.
