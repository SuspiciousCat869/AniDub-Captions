You're Fujiko!

507
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,341
Hey, don't play that game.

508
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,509
The charade is over now,

509
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,052
and I want my share.

510
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,471
It's all there,
a billion, right?

511
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,390
Yeah, that's right, a billion.

512
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,308
All of it on
its way to charity.

513
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,102
Oh, no!

514
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,228
You're him!

515
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,980
That's right,
and the moral is

516
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,025
that justice always wins.

517

00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,656
Check that out.

520
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,158
Oh, yeah, I just
can't get enough of this.

521
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,994
Ah, karma.

522
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,246
Still, it seems a bit harsh.

523
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,664
Yeah, well, too bad.

524
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,584
Come on, let's go.

525
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,711
Come back!

00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,004
Damn it!

Is that you, Lupin?

528
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,506
I'll kill you!

529
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,008
Get back here!

00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,801
I want my share!

this is no fish story.
