With this arrest warrant,

174

Hey, hold on now,

You don't have any authority

a warrant right here!

183

185
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,147
There's no watermark
and as you know,

186
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,065
without a watermark,
it's not considered legal

187
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,650
in a court of law.

188
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,985

Hey, take it easy, Pops.

197
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,001
There's not much any
of us can do right now

198
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,085
but hang around and wait.

Here's the deal, listen up.

207

Right now, we join forces
to defeat our mutual enemy

208
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,523

I'm all yours.

Pops, do we partner up or not?

Hmm, well, all right,
but how the heck

to lure me to Hilder

374

You may be a gifted maniac,
but you're a lousy businessman.
