the guy at the casino,

191
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,381
has got Monaco in his pocket,

192
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,592
he's a major capo
in the mob around here.

193
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,677
What a surprise, and
here I had him figured

194
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,179
for an English professor.

195
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,765
He's hosting an exclusive
little party at the Grand Prix

196
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,268
tomorrow with a dozen of the
highest rollers in Monaco.

197
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,895
Exactly who are these guys?

198
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,272
Second and third
generation money, mostly,

199
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,734
compulsive gamblers,
all relatively new to town.

200
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,155
That's perfect, sounds like
old Nexus has himself set up

201
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,784
to preside over a first class
sheep shearing tomorrow.

202
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,661
Exactly my point,
and like I said,

203
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,246
these guys are all high rollers,

204
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,790
so Nexus will be moving
some major dough.

205
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,292
And when I say major dough,
I'm talking about enough money

206
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,545
combined to make
the royal family here

207
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,213
look like the Simpsons.

208
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:33,591
Oh, what I'd give
for a piece of that!

209
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,760
Jackie Stewart.

210
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,971
Wittman.

211
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,598
Lauda, it's a perfect set up.

212
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,268
Because amateurs like our
particular flock of sheep

213
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,270
always tend to bet
on the celebrity.

214
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,148
Oh, it's making me crazy,
I coulda been there,

215
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,108
I coulda beaten
every one of 'em!

216
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,234
(groaning)

217
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,319
Yeah, well unless you can
beat them all on foot now,

218
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,196
it's all over, so forget it!

219
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,322
(whimpering)

220
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,533
That's not
necessarily so, Jigen.

221
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,660
All that money concentrated
on big name drivers

222
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,455
makes for pretty nice odds for
a talented dark horse, like you.

223
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,833
In fact, that's the whole
plan, Nexus has prepared

224
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,377
to bet the farm on you,
Lupin, if you'll do it.

225
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,504
Now I get it, he didn't
want Lupin's dough,

226
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,007
he wanted Lupin himself,
and to get him,

227
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,341
he had to get his machine,

228
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,843
so if Lupin wants
to drive tomorrow,

229
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,219
he has to drive for Nexus.

230
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,345
That's right, but at least

231
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,347
everyone's on the same page
here, I mean, at the end

232
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,350
of the day, we all just want to
see Lupin win tomorrow, right?

233
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,476
Oh, that's not the point,

234
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,437
I mean, I know if I enter
the race I'm gonna win,

235
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,856
but why would I wanna win the
race if winning the race means

236
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,442
I'd be helping a
creep like Nexus!

237
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,568
No offense.

238
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,778
It's okay, Lupin, I thought
you might feel that way,

239
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,114
that's why I prepared
an alternate plan for you.

that way you can drive

242
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,745
in the race tomorrow and
you could pay Nexus back
