Well, let me tell
you a little story.

267
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,708
Once upon a time, around
the end of the 10th century,

268
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,586
there was a particularly
enthusiastic Viking

269
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,171
by the name of Glamat,

270
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,007
who merrily vandalized
his way from the North Sea

271
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,551
all the way to the Baltic.

272
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,720
In the course of his
brief and brutal career,

273
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,973
he managed to plunder a hoard
of gold and jewels that would

274
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,227
make the Sultan of Brunei
look like a panhandler.

275
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,479
He hid it all in a cave
somewhere, supposedly,

276
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,440
until a local fisherman
stumbled on it one day.

277
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,317
That was 20 years ago.

278
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,569
The fisherman was a
piece of work himself.

279
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,988
He never touched any of it.

280
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,449
He just sealed up the cave
and got a secret kick out

281
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,993
of knowing that he was the
richest guy in the world.

282
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:20,998
This eccentric old widower
was Latica and Anika's father.

283
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,876
Right before he died, he
decided to share his secret

284
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,836
with his two little daughters.

285
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,589
He took some of the gold
and paid another local nutjob

286
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:33,010
to create this weird sort of
laser tattooing contraption.

287
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,180
The images are only visible
for a few days each year

of the summer solstice.

289

that cockamamie tattooing beam.
