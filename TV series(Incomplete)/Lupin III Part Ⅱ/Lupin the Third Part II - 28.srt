"Dear Paris
Metropolitan Police,

13
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,549
this singular city, once
the world's capital of art,

14

has of late become

therefore, in an act
of civic‐minded protest,

I, Lupin the Third, will
restore Paris' soul to her

No thanks, no time for that.

I hear that there's been

Mmhmm, yes, that's right.

00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,160
It's quite absurd.

26
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,620
The number of
banks is amazing.

27
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,080
How many are there?

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,707
Hundreds everywhere.

29

Is that them there?

30
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,171
Those, my dear Inspector,
are just the main branches.

The whole thing is just
a waste of my resources.

I mean, beyond the
logistics involved,

33
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,594
one would require
an army of thieves

34

in order to pull
off such a thing.

35

Except we're
talking about Lupin!

36

But the man is a
human, n'est‐ce pas?

Well, that I won't know
for sure until I catch him.

And this time
Lupin's going down.

you said that before?

Uh, hmm.

Anyway, until all of this
nonsense is resolved,

you can go ahead

Oh, well, I wouldn't
want to impose on you.

341

neighborhood back then.

I guess I was hoping it
would cheer me up, but...

But, uh, hey, come on in.

349
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,344
Let's sit down and, uh,

I'm not used to being flattered.

to interrupt you.

Yes, well, excuse me,

365
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,388

might like to know

that there's a
cop car outside.

00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,435
Ah, and speaking of which,
I'd like to introduce you

368
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,855
to my new friend here,
Mademoiselle Melon.

369

What, that's impossible.

ever recognize me?

I might be familiar with.

373

Ah, but it's a gift you
won't have much use for

care to demonstrate

your skill with these.
