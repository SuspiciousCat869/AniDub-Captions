brought on by
prolonged or even sudden

00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,717
and rather dramatic
changes in body chemistry,

118
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:28,972
and these can, theoretically,
produce atypical phenomenon.

119
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,683
What in the hell
does that mean?

120
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:35,312
Every single body contains
a small amount of electricity,

00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,440
but it is relatively
weak so one doesn't stick

to one's refrigerator.

123
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,820
But one's amperage could be
increased by various means.

124
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,030
By perhaps diet, say,

125
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,283
and even some certain
environmental factors.

126
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,702
If a sufficient positive
charge is generated,

127
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,537
well, it could then react

128
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,873
against a positive
charged field,

129
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:58,084

to appear to float.

However, a charge
that was strong enough

133
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,386
to actually accomplish
this feat would kill a man.

it didn't kill them,
