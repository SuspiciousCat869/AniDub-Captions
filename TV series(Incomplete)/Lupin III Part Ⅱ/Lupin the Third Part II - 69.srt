This is the capo dei capi of
the New York mafia, Alec Cabane.

91
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,208
Jors was a kingmaker in
international politics,

92
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,710
and not just
'cause of his money.

93
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,754
He kept dirt, major dirt on
all sorts of world leaders

94
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,633
locked up in his vault
in that machine there.

95
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,969
Cabane raided the
vault somehow, and well,

96
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,138
made off with the machine.

97
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,432
But he found out the
machine was voice‐coded.

98
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:34,394
He needed a specific print,
his wife's vocal print.

99
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,022
He's not gonna stop till
he gets his hands on her,
