336
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,234
Turn it around.

337
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,406
I want road blocks
set up everywhere!

338
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,741
Nothing in this freaking city

339
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,743
moves without
my approval, got it?

340
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,704
The whole department's
reputation is on the line here!

341
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:42,913
Judging from the film,

342
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,124
I'd say they were
gone about 40 minutes.

343
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,083
They hit the box office,

344
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,585
loaded the cash
in a stolen truck,

345
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,253
then planned to hide
the truck somewhere

346
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,589
and return here
for a perfect alibi.

347
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,632
But something screwed up

348
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,342
and they didn't
make it back in time

349
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,385
which means Lupin
and his scumbags

350
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,472
are probably somewhere between
the stadium and the prison.

351
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,098
(knocking)

352
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,516
Come in!

353
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,644
Excuse me, Chief,
but we need you to authorize

354
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,104
a flight permit to transfer
the Corcovado Christ

355
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,272
to the factory for repair.

356
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,774
The transportation
crew is ready

357
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,567
and awaiting
clearance for takeoff.

358
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,777
Oh yes, that's right.

359
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,945
It must have slipped my mind
with this other mess.

360
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,281
Very good, I'll
issue it right away.

361
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,284
Hold it, Chief, what's all
this about a flight permit?

362
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,786
For the repair
of the Christ statue

363
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,205
Lupin crashed into
on his drunken joyride.

364
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,290
Are you talking
about that huge monument

365

366

Mm‐hmm.

367
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,294
This statue right here.

368
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,546
It is the pride of our city.

369
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,464
Ah‐ha!

370
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,633
‐Hmm?
‐That's it!

371
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,134
It's almost exactly halfway

372
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,637
between the stadium
and the prison, see?

373
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,097
The distance is about perfect.

374
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,307
Chief, how big is
this statue, anyway?

375
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,642
About 120 feet.

376
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,644
Is it solid or hollow inside?

377
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,814
There's a small chapel inside
that holds about 150 people,

378
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,816
but it's been closed
ever since the accident.
