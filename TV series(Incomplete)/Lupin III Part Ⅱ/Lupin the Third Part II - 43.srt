00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,276

It was Coshusan who
stole it from the museum.

But why'd you give
it to her anyway?

183

Simple, I knew that the black
market value of the bones

184
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,498
would only
appreciate over time.

the bones somewhere secure

what on earth
could be more secure
