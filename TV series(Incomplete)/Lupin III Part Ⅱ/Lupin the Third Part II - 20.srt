Sensei, how can I?

To be one with the
breath of nature,

98
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,249

precept that must be etched

upon the very soul
of the Iga Ninja.

Wise men know that which
blooms in springtime

101
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,673
and bears fruit in
autumn must (indistinct)

does not return, Sensei.

same form, Goemon,
