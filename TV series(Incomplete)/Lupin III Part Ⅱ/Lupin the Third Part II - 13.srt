00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:00,027
I was surrounded by friggin
zombies, for God sakes.

497
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,362
Anyway, you don't
want that thing.

498
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,947
It's nothing but bad luck.

499
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,657
Yeah, but still.

500
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,159
I must say I admire your
(speaking French), Lupin.

501
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,453
I mean, you blew up the
temple of an evil deity

502
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,830
and yet, just look at you.

503
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,122
Ah, what's he gonna do to me?

504
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,499
It can't be worse
than watching Fujiko

505
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,002
throw herself at old man Heath
or diddle that dumb rock.

506
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,296
Oh, you can't
really blame me, can you?

507
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,382
I mean if diamonds
are a girl's best friend

508
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,635
well then, something that rare's
got to be more like a lover.

509
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:25,970
Oh, sweetheart‐‐

510
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,304
‐Huh?
‐Is that...

511
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,472
Hey, it's Pops.

512
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,225
My darling, you're so
smooth and silky and stuff.

513
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,185
Even smoother than Mommy,
and don't tell her,

514
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,229
but I think you even
smell a little better.

515
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,647
It'll be our little secret.

516
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:37,857
My ruby, hey!

517
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,483
Cool it, Fujiko,
are you crazy?

518
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,277
Listen, do you hear that?

519
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,445
Huh?

520
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,781

Hey, there you are!

There's this old rich guy

533
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,352
and he's got jewels
implanted in his head

534
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,520
and he rides around in a blimp.

535
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,397
And he invites all
these famous detectives

536
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,690
to ride around with him
in his blimp

537
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,358
so they can watch
him capture me.

But then things get weird.

Well, okay, more weird.

00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,779
It's the Obligatory
Blimp episode.

Did I mention
it's really weird?
