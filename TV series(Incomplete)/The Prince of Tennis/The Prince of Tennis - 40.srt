00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:15,923
ANNOUNCER: Game to
Fuji, two games to one.

2
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:17,856
Fuji leads.

3
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:18,723
BOY: The brown bear.

4
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:21,623
Amazing.

5
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:24,623
[theme music]

6
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:43,147
-Here's another chance!

7
00:01:49,114 --> 00:01:50,780
-He returned it again.

8
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:01,447
-Ryoma's good, but is
this the end for him?

9
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:13,614
-High lob.

10
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:14,314
-A smash.

11
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:14,814
-Impossible.

12
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,647
-What's wrong, Echizen?

13
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,814
-This is so unlike Ryoma.

14
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:33,447
-That boy.

15
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,780
So darn stubborn.

16
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:37,947
-I've never seen
Echizen like this.

17
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,247
I can't believe he
missed that smash.

18
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,347
-Another lob.

19
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,280
HORIO: It's no good.

20
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:04,247
The smash doesn't work.

21
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,914
He returned it!

22
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:24,047
-Was that chance,
or something else?

23
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:29,514
ANNOUNCER: Out.

24
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:30,214
-That was out?

25
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:31,114
Not Fuji.

26
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:32,680
Not this match.

27
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:34,714
-Fuji never misses
a counter shot.

28
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:47,880
-Not again.

29
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:50,380
-In case you didn't
know, you don't

30
00:03:50,414 --> 00:03:51,647
have to hit any more lobs.

31
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:05,680
ANNOUNCER: Out.

32
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:07,647
HORIO: What the-- Out?

33
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,814
I can't believe Fuji missed.

34
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:11,880
-So, he was just checking
the timing earlier.

35
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:13,980
It's unbelievable what you do.

36
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,280
-You're amazing, Echizen.

37
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:27,780
-Thanks.

38
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,580
-Would you normally
aim for that spot?

39
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:34,047
-What do you mean?

40
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,347
-That kid can delay
his smash by hitting it

41
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,014
at the net to deflect it.

42
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,414
-Now I get it.

43
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:47,814
That must be why Fuji's sweet
spot went off ever so slightly.

44
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:50,647
-Can you really make
such a thing work?

45
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,880
-The little guy's
the one to do it.

46
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:56,180
-Eiji, were you really
able to see that?

47
00:04:56,214 --> 00:04:56,980
-Yeah, well?

48
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:59,347
-That's amazing.

49
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,280
Echizen's coming back.

50
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:01,647
That's incredible.

51
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,080
-I can't believe it.

52
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:06,614
Now the match is up in the air.

53
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:11,180
-That brat showing off again

54
00:05:11,214 --> 00:05:12,647
[beeping]

55
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,614
INUI (VOICEOVER): Hm.

56
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,580
It's been 10 minutes
since they ran.

57
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,347
Both of them are
the type of athletes

58
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,414
to start feeling tired
right around now.

59
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:20,947
-Hey, Coach.

60
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,880
-Hm?

61
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:23,647
-It's almost time now.

62
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,480
OK.

63
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:29,547
Momoshiro, get on Court
D. It's your turn.

64
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,380
-Huh?

65
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,214
Right.

66
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,780
Just what I've been waiting for.

67
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:35,347
I can't let Echizen be
the only one to look good.

68
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,480
So, who am I playing?

69
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:44,547
-I'll play you.

70
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:49,880
-OK.

71
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:51,280
In five minutes,
Kaidoh and Kawamura

72
00:05:51,314 --> 00:05:55,514
will play each other on Court
E. And 15 minutes after that,

73
00:05:55,547 --> 00:06:01,080
Oishi and Kikumaru will
commence play on Court C.

74
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:03,114
INUI (VOICEOVER): Each
person has different kinds

75
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:06,514
of exhaustion after totally
expending his energy.

76
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:08,880
The purpose of this
particular training session

77
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:11,714
is to see how strong
their concentration is

78
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,614
when they are physically
at their weakest.

79
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:19,614
-Wow.

80
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,314
This is amazing.

81
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,914
-It's Momo and the
captain, and a match

82
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:25,747
between the golden pair!

83
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,247
-That is a must-see match up!

84
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,180
-But I wanna stay and watch
Ryoma's match until the end!

85
00:06:32,214 --> 00:06:33,680
-Oh, man, you're kidding.

86
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:36,080
I have to play the captain?

87
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:37,980
-Uh, Momoshiro?

88
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:39,514
-No luck.

89
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:42,980
No luck for me today.

90
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:44,814
-He looks ready to play.

91
00:06:44,847 --> 00:06:45,814
-Yeah.

92
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:47,747
I'll say.

93
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,347
-Those two.

94
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,314
I wouldn't mind seeing
them play each other.

95
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:56,647
-In that case, let's
finish this up quickly.

96
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,847
-Will you lose to me?

97
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,547
-No way.

98
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:09,480
-Echizen's match is
really heating up now.

99
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:10,880
-Whoa, everywhere
you look, there

100
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:12,747
are great matches going on.

101
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,847
-But which one should
we be watching?

102
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,247
-Look over there.

103
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,747
Momo and the captain are about
to start playing their match.

104
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:26,814
ANNOUNCER: One set match,
Momoshiro to serve.

105
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:27,880
MOMOSHIRO (VOICEOVER): OK.

106
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,047
I won't hold back.

107
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,880
-OK.

108
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:31,714
Come on, Momoshiro.

109
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:41,147
I see.

110
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,947
You've gotten stronger
since the last time.

111
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,347
His powerful stroke will
be a formidable weapon

112
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,647
at the Kanto-- No,
even at the nationals.

113
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:56,747
-A drop shot?

114
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,814
-By Momo?

115
00:07:57,847 --> 00:07:59,414
He's good, and he's
got the advantage.

116
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,980
-He returned it.

117
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:04,714
-Momo's powerful drop shot?

118
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:05,814
-Fantastic.

119
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:07,647
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER):
He has a fine attack.

120
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:15,914
KACHIRO: Momo's dunk
smash is awesome!

121
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:17,380
-Did you see that?

122
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,314
Amazing, he ended it.

123
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:22,747
-I can't believe he used a
drop shot against the captain.

124
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:28,114
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER):
He's no ordinary player.

125
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:30,247
He's Seigaku's
number one trickster.

126
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,300
-Right!

127
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,000
Here goes!

128
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:23,233
-It has been 15 minutes.

129
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:24,000
All right.

130
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:27,467
Oishi and Kikumaru start.

131
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,533
-All right, Oishi.

132
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,300
Let's get on with it.

133
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,033
But loser gets to
drink "penal-tea."

134
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:34,600
-That's really rough.

135
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:35,933
-Hey guys.

136
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:38,733
Look, the golden pair is getting
ready to play one another.

137
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:42,633
-Between Oishi's moon volley
shot and Kikumaru's acrobatics,

138
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,200
I wonder who the
stronger player could be.

139
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,000
KIKUMARU (VOICEOVER):
That Oishi.

140
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:59,000
He keeps on aiming
for the deep corners.

141
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,900
He wants to make me run
all over the baseline.

142
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:06,367
INUI (VOICEOVER): Eiji
you're quick to recover.

143
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,567
However, we have
to figure out how

144
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,933
to distribute your energy in the
matches for maximum efficiency,

145
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:16,400
especially against
someone like Oishi,

146
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,567
who thinks very strategically.

147
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,367
-Kikumaru and Oishi are amazing.

148
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,033
Even though they're
partners, they're

149
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:23,167
not holding back at all.

150
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
They're treating this
like a tournament match.

151
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,467
-You mean it's serious?

152
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,600
-You bet it is.

153
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:31,300
They may be partners,
but a match is a match.

154
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:40,067
It's serious business
when they're playing

155
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,133
-Eiji's great.

156
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:43,033
It doesn't matter if
I hit left or right.

157
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:46,433
Well, then, right
down the center!

158
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:47,067
-Kikumaru Beam!

159
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:52,500
-Wow, there it is!

160
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:54,467
Kikumaru's acrobatic form!

161
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,333
-Neither one of them is willing
to give an inch to the other.

162
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:59,333
-They know each other's style.

163
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,667
That's why this is
such a great match up.

164
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,633
KAIDOH: Take that!

165
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,600
-That voice!

166
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:08,033
It's Kaidoh versus Kawamura.

167
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,533
[? -burning! ?]

168
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,000
-It's power tennis at its best.

169
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,900
-Kawamura.

170
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:23,333
He's burning up.

171
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:24,300
-Sure is.

172
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:24,800
Amazing.

173
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:36,767
-That was out.

174
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,067
-Aw, his Boomerang Snake
Shot was wide left.

175
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,000
-Yeah, I guess
against Kawamura, he

176
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,467
feels like he's a
little overpowered.

177
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,667
INUI (VOICEOVER): Against
an opponent like Kawamura,

178
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:54,067
it's crucial to raise the odds
of the Boomerang Snake Shot.

179
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,500
[hiss]

180
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:57,000
-Huh?

181
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:06,367
-Hm?

182
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,733
-Hey, it's the captain.

183
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:11,433
So why is he-- the match
couldn't be over already?

184
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:12,267
Could it?

185
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:12,900
-No.

186
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,167
Not against Momo.

187
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,000
There's no way he
could have already--

188
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,633
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER): He played
him with all he's got, huh?

189
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:20,467
BOY: That's Tezuka.

190
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,533
Over in a jiffy.

191
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:25,367
-BOY: Tezuka-- you--

192
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,633
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER):
Momoshiro-- it

193
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,633
seems the sprain in his
right leg has healed.

194
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:36,300
However, if he
favors the other leg,

195
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,400
he won't be able to
display his top form.

196
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,033
-I see.

197
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:09,367
He's sure stronger
than he looks.

198
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,267
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER): When
he gets knocked down,

199
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,667
he always returns twice
as strong as before.

200
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,033
-Even though he won
today's match up,

201
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,467
who knows what will
happen in a month?

202
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,533
I'm looking forward to
the days that follow.

203
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,000
-Hey.

204
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:37,433
The sky suddenly
turned dark and cloudy.

205
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:41,567
-Looks like we're going
to get a heavy downpour.

206
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,500
-And here it comes now!

207
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,467
-Oh, dear.

208
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,700
Rain now, of all things.

209
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:48,667
-Oh, no.

210
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,667
Weather guy said--

211
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,767
-Aw, it's starting to rain.

212
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,600
-Never trust those--

213
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:54,533
-Anybody have an umbrella?

214
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,900
-This is bad.

215
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:58,300
I'm afraid we'll have
to call off practice.

216
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,667
-I guess so.

217
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,100
RYUZAKI: Practice is over.

218
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,400
Everyone inside.

219
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:05,367
BOY: All right, let's
get out of here.

220
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,233
-Seventh graders, get
the net and the balls.

221
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:07,900
Hurry.

222
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,267
-OK!

223
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,533
-This is terrible.

224
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:11,833
-Aw, too bad.

225
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,667
We'll have to play later.

226
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,433
-Huh?

227
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:17,533
-Huh?

228
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:19,333
Those two are still out
on the court playing.

229
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,067
-You've got to be kidding me.

230
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:34,533
-What are they thinking?

231
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:36,467
In a heavy rain like this?

232
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,400
-Got me.

233
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:38,367
Those two are crazy.

234
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,167
[shout]

235
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,033
-Echizen's-- amazing.

236
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:20,000
-Echizen.

237
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,567
-He intends to finish this.

238
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,733
-You won't run away, will you?

239
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:45,567
-We can still play.

240
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,567
It's just rain.

241
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,733
FUJI (VOICEOVER): He switched.

242
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:02,200
Right hand grip.

243
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:03,100
It's a kick serve.

244
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,600
-Hey, you two!

245
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:15,067
How long are you gonna be
playing out there, you fools?

246
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:19,700
-Huh?

247
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,733
-Now get this straight, you two.

248
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:23,333
This is practice.

249
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:24,967
If you're that eager to play.

250
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,333
You can do it any time.

251
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,467
You're on the same team.

252
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:37,300
The real match comes
tomorrow at the Metros.

253
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,833
Have you've forgotten that
rain is a tennis player's worst

254
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:41,200
enemy?

255
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,100
What if one of you gets hurt
in something as petty as this?

256
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,000
-Too bad, but this
match is mine.

257
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,667
-No fair.

258
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,867
Just because you're winning
4-3 doesn't mean anything.

259
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,767
It's not over yet.

260
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,400
-It's over and I don't
wanna hear any complaints.

261
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,833
-No matter what I
do, he catches up.

262
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:28,867
That kind of thrill
is rare, indeed.

263
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,067
-Say, Tezuka.

264
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,833
Did you feel this way
when you played Ryoma?

265
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,200
TEZUKA: So you knew?

266
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:44,600
-Yeah, sort of.

267
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,967
-Sweet skies.

268
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,367
Rain finally stopped.

269
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,200
Great.

270
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,867
-Huh?

271
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,000
-Since your match with
Fuji went unfinished,

272
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:09,867
you don't feel very
satisfied, do you?

273
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,233
-Heard about your match.

274
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:14,000
Seems your dunk smash was
returned easily by the captain.

275
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:15,133
-Shut up!

276
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,833
-If you think my
dunk smash is easy,

277
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:22,967
I'll show you right here now
how very mistaken you are.

278
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,200
-Wouldn't it be kind of a shock
if you lost twice in one day?

279
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:27,967
-Hey.

280
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,567
Don't talk with your mouth full.

281
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,867
-Still.

282
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,267
Seigaku is fun.

283
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,633
-How so?

284
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:36,067
-Because it seems like there
are two beasts on the same team.

285
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,767
-Don't you mean there
are three beasts?

286
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,267
-Huh?

287
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,967
-That's it for me.

288
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,800
MAN: Yuta Fuji.

289
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:00,800
Yuta Fuji.

290
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,033
Phone call for Yuta Fuji.

291
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:04,333
-Huh?

292
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:05,467
Yes?

293
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,133
This is Yuta Fuji.

294
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:08,233
-Huh?

295
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:08,800
Oh, it's you.

296
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:09,767
Shusuke.

297
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,067
So, what do you want?

298
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,367
SHUSUKE (ON PHONE): Ha ha.

299
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,300
I can call, can't I?

300
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,500
Just wondering how
you were doing.

301
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:17,633
-Just fine.

302
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,667
Everything's fine over
here at St. Rudolph's.

303
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,300
-That's great.

304
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,733
I played against Echizen today.

305
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:23,633
YUTA (ON PHONE): What?

306
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:24,900
You kidding?

307
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:26,133
So how did it go?

308
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,367
-You know, Yuta.

309
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,767
-Hm?

310
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,200
-The Seigaku team
is very strong.

311
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,233
-What?

312
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:35,233
You trying to say something?

313
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:36,167
Just spit it out!

314
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,167
-Give me the phone.

315
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,100
Now, Yuta.

316
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:40,933
-Mizuki?

317
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:42,767
-Ah.

318
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,200
Fuji of Seigaku.

319
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,700
Checking on the competition?

320
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,033
That just won't--

321
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:47,900

[laughing]

324
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,900
-Now then, Yuta.

325
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:01,967
Let's begin training.

326
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,100
-Huh?

327
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:04,900
But I'm done with all
my training for today.

328
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:06,867
MIZUKI: And you think
you're capable of beating

329
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,667
Shusuke Fuji now?

330
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,600
Come on.

331
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,367
I know you want to beat him.

332
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,367
We can work on your
skills together.

333
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,600
All night long.

334
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,533
YUTA: But Mizuki!

335
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:20,100
[wicked laughter]

00:22:05,743 --> 00:22:07,210
TAICHI: Da da dada!

339
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,643
Pleased to meet you.

340
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:12,277
I'm Yamabuki Junoir High
tennis manager Taichi Dan.

341
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,377
The semifinals of the
Metropolitan Tournament

342
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,943
have finally begun!

343
00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:18,010
Fudomine is a
fearsome enemy, and we

344
00:22:18,043 --> 00:22:19,777
mustn't let your guard down.

345
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,810
Please do your best, Akutsu.

346
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:23,943
Um, Akutsu?

347
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:24,677
What?

348
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,377
No way.

349
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,743
What happened?

350
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:28,110
Impossible!

351
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:30,977
Next on "The Prince
of Tennis," Trouble!

352
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,077
Akutsu, this is really bad.

353
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,743
Fudomine is--
