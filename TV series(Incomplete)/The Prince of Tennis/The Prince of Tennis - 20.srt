1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,136
-Captain?

2
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,936
-Listen to me.

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,003
Finish the match in 10
minutes, or you forfeit.

4
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:20,836
You got that?

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,030
-That's enough time.

6
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:26,030
[theme music]

7
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,697
SHINJI (VOICEOVER):
That's right.

8
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,697
Bring it on.

9
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,664
I haven't destroyed you yet.

10
00:01:51,664 --> 00:01:52,130
-Huh?

11
00:01:57,664 --> 00:01:58,164
-Wow.

12
00:01:58,197 --> 00:02:00,064
What a mtch.

13
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:01,664
-Echizen's doing really great!

14
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:03,164
-He hasn't slowed down at all.

15
00:02:03,197 --> 00:02:04,897
-Not only has he
not slowed down,

16
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,930
but his shots are getting faster
as the match has progressed.

17
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:09,764
-Even with that eye injury.

18
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:10,330
Unbelievable.

19
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,197
-Hey.

20
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,864
By the way, what is
that technique of yours?

21
00:02:23,897 --> 00:02:26,897
My arm feels a little
funny sometimes.

22
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,564
Like it's going numb.

23
00:02:28,597 --> 00:02:29,064
Temporarily.

24
00:02:56,764 --> 00:03:00,164
BOY (VOICEOVER): You've
got your pace back, Shinji.

25
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:02,597
-Looks like he's only
giving Echizen top

26
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,764
spins and slices to return.

27
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:07,064
-I guess the same thing was
happening before the injury

28
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:08,097
to his eye.

29
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,930
-I see.

30
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:10,964
That must have been the cause.

31
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:12,197
It's a spot.

32
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,397
I'm pretty sure of it.

33
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,430
-But what spot?

34
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:17,364
-By returning
consecutive balls that

35
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,897
spin at about the same speed
in opposite directions,

36
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,664
the muscles go numb,
but only for an instant.

37
00:03:22,697 --> 00:03:23,797
Go numb?

38
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,464
But if that's true, then
he can't move his arm

39
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,797
when he needs to hit.

40
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,130
-Right.

41
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:31,697
Whenever Echizen is in a spot,
Ibu takes advantage of it.

42
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:47,164
-Game to Ibu of Fudoumine.

43
00:03:47,197 --> 00:03:49,364
Game count four to three.

44
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:50,264
-Wow!

45
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,630
Can you even believe it?

46
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:52,530
-Fudoumine won!

47
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:53,497
-That's gotta hurt.

48
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,864
SHINJI (VOICEOVER):
I can feel it.

49
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:56,464
I can see it.

50
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:58,530
His muscles contracting.

51
00:03:58,564 --> 00:03:59,730
-Oh, no!

52
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:00,764
He lost his service.

53
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:01,997
That's bad.

54
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,530
-He's already at a disadvantage
with his eye injury.

55
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:06,430
Now if he has to
deal with a spot--

56
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:10,630
-There is a 0% chance of him
being able to make a return.

57
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:16,230
His grip loosens for a moment as
well, so he can't hit the ball.

58
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:18,597
He has 7 minutes
and 40 seconds left.

59
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,397
-Shinji Ibu.

60
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,730
I'm very surprised Fudoumine
has such a talented player.

61
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:28,830
-Speaking of tennis
phenoms, he's

62
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:32,697
at the same level as Fuji, one
of our top regulars at Seigaku.

63
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,664
I can't believe he's remained
off the radar for so long.

64
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:40,697
-He's better than we expected.

65
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,097
By contrast, our little
guy is slowing down.

66
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:49,964
ANNOUNCER: 15-Love.

67
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,464
-Hey, watch out!

68
00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:04,797
[groan]

69
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,030
-Looks like he's hurting
physically and mentally.

70
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:19,264
-Come on, now.

71
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:19,864
Do it, Echizen.

72
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,197
-Oh!

73
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,097
-Was that the spot again?

74
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,264
-There is no question about it.

75
00:05:44,297 --> 00:05:45,064
ANNOUNCER: 30-Love.

76
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:51,297
BOY (VOICEOVER): Shinji.

77
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,797
You've completely
mastered the spot now.

78
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,364
-Less than five minutes to go.

79
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:07,164
-Go, Echizen!

80
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,930
-Yeah!

81
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:12,730
ANNOUNCER: 40-Love.

82
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:19,630
-He's allowing Fudoumine
to get back into the game.

83
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:21,230
It's sure going to
be a real showdown.

84
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:27,197
-Is he going to be
all right, Tezuka?

85
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,797
Forget about the 10 minutes.

86
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,630
Maybe it's time to pull
him out of there right now.

87
00:06:31,664 --> 00:06:33,497
-Don't worry about it.

88
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:33,997
-Tezuka!

89
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:40,930
-Oh, dear.

90
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:41,430
Ryoma!

91
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,264
-That's nice.

92
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:50,330
Everybody feels sorry for you.

93
00:06:50,364 --> 00:06:55,930
But that's just what you
wanted, now, isn't it?

94
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:56,430
-Hm.

95
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,997
You're just going to have to
play the match to the end.

96
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,597
-Hey.

97
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,764
-Huh?

98
00:07:04,797 --> 00:07:06,497
-Sorry to interrupt
your muttering,

99
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,297
but can you please
hurry up and serve?

100
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,664
My guess is that I only
have about three minutes

101
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,464
or so left to beat you.

102
00:07:14,497 --> 00:07:15,697
-Can you believe it?

103
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,530
That seventh grader is still
out there provoking him.

104
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,264
-He's a good
opponent for Shinji.

105
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:23,364
-You are so arrogant!

106
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:30,030
-Just top spins and slices?

107
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:31,430
I don't like that technique.

108
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:31,930
-Huh?

109
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:38,530
-But then again, I've
found two weak points.

110
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:39,497
-What?

111
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:39,997
Huh?

112
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,830
-Have you tried to hit
it against a person who

113
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:49,230
can hit with either hand?

114
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:49,730
-Whoa!

115
00:07:52,497 --> 00:07:53,130
ANNOUNCER: 40-15.

116
00:07:56,364 --> 00:07:57,530
-I see now.

117
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,330
That's the way he
intends to win.

118
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:07,764
-This is weak point number one!

119
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:08,964
-No way.

120
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:10,397
It's impossible to read
the direction of the ball

121
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,030
at the same time
you're switching hands

122
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:14,630
to get ready to hit it.

123
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:17,130
-He's doing a split
step with one leg.

124
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,564
I see.

125
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:20,197
If he can do that
kind of split step,

126
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,597
it's easy to switch
hands quickly.

127
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,897
What incredible reflexes.

128
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,664
-I don't care
which hand you use.

129
00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:29,230
I'm going to make both
of your arms numb.

130
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,530
-Look!

131
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:42,130
I think the Fudoumine player
is only hitting slices now.

132
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:43,497
-You're right.

133
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,297
He's hitting both top spins and
slices to give Ryoma the spot.

134
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,197
-He wants to hit
top spins, but he's

135
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,030
finding it's not
so easy anymore.

136
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:51,364
-What?

137
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,497
-You hit top spins by skimming
the top part of the ball,

138
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,897
but it's almost impossible to
return a ball with top spin

139
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,997
when it comes at chest level.

140
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,030
In that case, he
can only hit slices.

141
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:10,264
-So that's it!

142
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:11,830
-It's hsi number two weak point.

143
00:09:11,864 --> 00:09:16,797
-Hey, where's your
top spin, huh?

144
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,997
-He's shutting down Shinji's
spot shot, with that injury.

145
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,797
What a player.

146
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,630
-Seigaku's Ryoma Echizen.

147
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:36,197
-That's easy!

148
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,630
-Yeah, Echizen!

149
00:09:38,664 --> 00:09:40,630
-It looks like he's
going to make it in time.

150
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:49,497
-No!

151
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,164
Ryoma's bleeding!

152
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:03,700
-Go, Ryoma!

153
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:15,234
-Echizen!

154
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:20,504
ANNOUNCER: Game to
Seigaku's Echizen.

155
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,704
-Great!

156
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:23,664
If Echizen wins the next
game, he'll win the match.

157
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:26,714
INUI: There's less
than two minutes left.

158
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:59,048
SHINJI (VOICEOVER): I'm
not gonna let you win.

159
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:01,081
I gotta let Captain
Tachibana take

160
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:04,048
care of the rest
of the tournament.

161
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,281
ANNOUNCER: 15-Love.

162
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:06,814
15-All.

163
00:11:06,848 --> 00:11:08,948
-Shinji's not giving
up the match yet.

164
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:10,581
-Come on!

165
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:11,281
ANNOUNCER: 30-15.

166
00:11:14,248 --> 00:11:16,648
40-15.

167
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:19,281
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER): Echizen
is losing his strength.

168
00:11:19,314 --> 00:11:20,281
-How much longer?

169
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:28,114
BOY: Tezuka?

170
00:11:47,348 --> 00:11:48,081
-Hey!

171
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:49,214
Echizen!

172
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:51,481
Time to nail down a glorious
victory for Seigaku!

173
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,514
SHINJI: I'm going to win it.

174
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:21,114
SHINJI (VOICEOVER): The ball
spun in the opposite direction.

175
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:23,881
ANNOUNCER: Game and match
to Echizen of Seigaku.

176
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:27,814
-Awesome.

177
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:30,614
He turned that overhead
shot into a kick serve.

178
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:31,248
-Wow!

179
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:31,948
Incredible, Ryoma.

180
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:37,048
-10 minutes.

181
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:38,814
Did I make it in time?

182
00:12:38,848 --> 00:12:39,248
-Yeah.

183
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:43,248
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER): Echizen.

184
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:44,214
Great job.

185
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:50,214
[cheering]

186
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:57,148
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER):
That kid really did it.

187
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:10,748
ANNOUNCER: The champion
of the district

188
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:14,214
manages is Seishun
Academy, and the runner up

189
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:15,614
is Fudoumine Junior High.

190
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:17,448
We hope both of your
schools play well

191
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:19,148
in the Metropolitan Tournament.

192
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:19,648
Thank you.

193
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:26,114
-They made it, Mr. Inoue.

194
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:28,081
Ryoma's team won
the championship.

195
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:50,914
-Huh?

196
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:54,214
Hey, um, so, is your right
arm feeling any better?

197
00:13:54,248 --> 00:13:55,914
-Oh, it's doing OK.

198
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:56,814
Don't worry about it.

199
00:13:56,848 --> 00:13:59,381
It really wasn't
your fault at all.

200
00:13:59,414 --> 00:14:00,481
-Here you go, Taka.

201
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:01,548
-Yeah!

202
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:04,148
Man, that was quite
a shock you gave me.

203
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:05,048
Ha!

204
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:05,848
-Wow.

205
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:07,481
What's wrong with this guy?

206
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,314
-I'll beat you next time.

207
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,014
-I'm looking forward to it.

208
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:12,914
-Hey, Mr. Viper.

209
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:14,881
-You shut up, rhythm dude.

210
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:16,648
-Hey, Echizen.

211
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:19,081
I'm sorry about your eye injury.

212
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:20,414
Are you all right?

213
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:23,214
You know what happened really
wasn't my fault, don't you?

214
00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:25,048
Oh, I get it now.

215
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,814
You did it on
purpose, didn't you?

216
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:27,448
Right.

217
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:28,981
I'll bet you did.

218
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:30,981
Boy, you really are
something else, you know--

219
00:14:31,014 --> 00:14:31,514
-Shinji.

220
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:33,981
-Oh, sorry.

221
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:37,148
-You still got a ways to go.

222
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:37,948
-Oh, Ryoma.

223
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:40,314
-Wow, you made it, Echizen!

224
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:42,214
-Congratulations, Ryoma.

225
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,448
-Is your eye feeling any better?

226
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:46,114
-It's OK.

227
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:49,848
-Bu-- But my grandma said for
you to come with us after you

228
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:50,614
change.

229
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:53,114
-Huh?

230
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:55,214
-I think Tachibana
really wanted to play

231
00:14:55,248 --> 00:14:57,148
their team captain, Tezuka.

232
00:14:57,181 --> 00:14:58,514
-I think so too.

233
00:14:58,548 --> 00:15:00,081
But then again,
it's all my fault

234
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:01,248
he didn't get to play him.

235
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,314
-I didn't say that.

236
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:03,248
What's your problem?

237
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:05,081
-Yeah, but it was
still my fault.

238
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:06,748
-Hm.

239
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:07,248
Huh?

240
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,881
We won't lose again.

241
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:18,514
I can promise you that.

242
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:21,114
-See you at the
Metro tournament.

243
00:15:21,148 --> 00:15:21,614
-Yeah.

244
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,348
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER): It
took them only six months

245
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:31,148
to bring the team this far.

246
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,014
I'm sure Fudoumine
will be a tough team.

247
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:39,148
INUI (VOICEOVER): I wonder why
Tachibana looks familiar to me.

248
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:44,314
I better do some
research on him.

249
00:15:55,114 --> 00:15:56,914
RYOMA: It stopped
bleeding already.

250
00:15:56,948 --> 00:15:59,848
-But you still need to
have it treated properly.

251
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:00,948
-Oh.

252
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:03,148
You say you got this eye
injury playing tennis?

253
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:04,148
-That's right.

254
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:06,181
-Are you sure was
caused by tennis?

255
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:07,414
-Yeah.

256
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:09,681
I already treated the boy
with the wrist injury.

257
00:16:09,714 --> 00:16:14,081
What a rough match
you guys must've had.

258
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:15,281
-Are you all right?

259
00:16:15,314 --> 00:16:16,514
-Yeah.

260
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:18,181
-Well, let's get out of
here and go somewhere else.

261
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:19,248
-Huh?

262
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,448
You mean we're going
somewhere else now?

263
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:21,114
-That's right.

264
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:21,948
No more moping.

265
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,048
Let's get ready and go.

266
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:24,348
What do you say?

267
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:25,114
Hm?

268
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:27,214
RYOMA: Reserved for the day.

269
00:16:27,248 --> 00:16:28,448
Is this a sushi restaurant?

270
00:16:31,814 --> 00:16:34,448
[chatter]

271
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:34,948
-Huh?

272
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:39,614
-Hey, where you going?

273
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:40,314
Come on in!

274
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:41,414
-There you are Echizen!

275
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:42,581
We're over here!

276
00:16:42,614 --> 00:16:44,114
-Hi there Ryoma.

277
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:44,881
Big smile.

278
00:16:44,914 --> 00:16:46,614
Say cheese for me.

279
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:47,681
-Cheese.

280
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,614
[excited chatter]

281
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:55,748
-Thank you for inviting all of
us to share our victory today.

282
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,681
-On behalf of our
magazine, we thank you too.

283
00:16:58,714 --> 00:17:00,081
-Oh, it's my pleasure.

284
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:02,781
Feel free to eat
up all you wants.

285
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,714
-Mr. Inoue and Ms.
Shiba, would you

286
00:17:04,748 --> 00:17:06,214
do me the favor of
keeping your eyes

287
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:08,014
on these kids for
a little while?

288
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:08,881
-Of course!

289
00:17:08,914 --> 00:17:10,214
Their big sister
will watch them.

290
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:11,781
With all the tender
love and care

291
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:13,714
they've grown accustomed to.

292
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:14,348
-Shiba.

293
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:17,148
What are you saying?

294
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:20,014
-What's going on?

295
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:21,648
-What are you gonna have first?

296
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:22,481
-Well--

297
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:23,581
-This is my dad's restaurant.

298
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:25,448
I called and told him
about our championship,

299
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:27,914
so he closed the
restaurant for us.

300
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:30,048
Come on, this is our
victory celebration.

301
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:31,914
Look alive, be merry!

302
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:32,881
Eat all you want.

303
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:34,114
-OK.

304
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:36,681
-Congratulations on your
championship, Coach Ryuzaki.

305
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:38,481
-It's just the
district preliminaries.

306
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:39,781
It's only gonna get tougher.

307
00:17:39,814 --> 00:17:43,081
-Oh, I'm sure you'll win
at the Metro tournament.

308
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:44,948
Especially with that
genius seventh grader

309
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,014
you have on your team.

310
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:48,181
He's very different
from my clumsy son.

311
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:49,548
-Hey, don't say that, dad.

312
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:50,781
You're embarrassing me.

313
00:17:50,814 --> 00:17:52,781
-Well, here you
go, Coach Ryuzaki.

314
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:53,714
I really shouldn't.

315
00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:55,114
I have to drive home.

316
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:56,114
-Oh, I'm sorry.

317
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:59,181
How about one for you, mister--

318
00:17:59,214 --> 00:18:01,514
-Tezuka, the team captain.

319
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:02,648
-Oh.

320
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,614
I guess I'll keep my big
mouth shut from now on.

321
00:18:07,514 --> 00:18:08,548
-This one's mine here.

322
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:09,848
Hey!

323
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:10,981
Kaidoh, no fair.

324
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:14,514
You know that spicy
eel is my favorite.

325
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:17,248
-Oh no.

326
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:18,848
I need more sushi!

327
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:20,514
RYOMA: Yeah, me too.

328
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:21,514
-Those guys.

329
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:25,414
A-ha!

330
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:26,348
Hey there, Fuji.

331
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:27,281
You're being sneaky.

332
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,614
You're taking all
the sushi rolls.

333
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:31,014
Hey, look over there.

334
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:33,014
-Hm?

335
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:35,214
Uh.

336
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,148
-Ow!

337
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,448
Wh-- wh-- what are you eating?

338
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:40,048
-A wasabi roll.

339
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:40,614
-Tea.

340
00:18:40,648 --> 00:18:41,148
Tea.

341
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:42,914
I need tea!

342
00:18:42,948 --> 00:18:45,814
[laughter]

343
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:50,614
-Time to leave.

344
00:18:50,648 --> 00:18:52,314
We still have to
stop by the school.

345
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:55,848
[chatter]

346
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:57,214
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER): Oh, well.

347
00:18:57,248 --> 00:18:58,514
Today's a special day.

348
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:03,748
BOY: Take a look at that.

349
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:04,814
MOMOSHIRO: Oh, man.

350
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:07,114
Look at this special
chirahi sushi bowl.

351
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:08,314
It looks great.

352
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,781
Thank you so much.

353
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:10,614
-Hey, Momo.

354
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:11,714
You've eaten too much already.

355
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:13,781
Try saving some for the
rest of us, would you?

356
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:14,848
-Give me a break.

357
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:16,481
It's first come, first
serve around here.

358
00:19:16,514 --> 00:19:17,314
-Hey, you're sneaky.

359
00:19:17,348 --> 00:19:18,981
Momo.

360
00:19:19,014 --> 00:19:21,714
-Ryoma, how about
a picture together?

361
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:22,948
Take a good one now, Kachiro.

362
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:23,448
-OK.

363
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:37,281
-Hey, that's my eel.

364
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:38,081
Oh!

365
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:39,314
There's more eel right here.

366
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:50,481
RYOMA: I'm home.

367
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:55,348
-Yo, Ryoma.

368
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:57,381
Did you have fun
at the tournament?

369
00:19:57,414 --> 00:19:58,848
-It wasn't bad.

370
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,714
I suffered a slight injury, but
it should get well on its own

371
00:20:01,748 --> 00:20:04,048
soon enough.

372
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:04,914
-Huh?

373
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:05,414
Injury?

374
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:12,014
What's that you
have on your face?

375
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:13,114
Seigaku?

376
00:20:13,148 --> 00:20:14,281
-You mean this eyepatch?

377
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:15,548
NANJIRO: Hurry up and get well?

378
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,781
-It's just a little souvenir
from the championship.

379
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:19,781
[laughter]

380
00:20:19,814 --> 00:20:23,248
[theme music]

381
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:55,468
-I'm Kenzo.

382
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:56,901
-I'm Shusuke.

383
00:20:56,934 --> 00:20:58,534
-We're the comicd spy duo!

384
00:20:58,568 --> 00:21:00,201
-Listen, Shunsuke.

385
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:01,968
Let's learn about
Echizen's secret.

386
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:04,368
-Where are we gonna
follow him to?

387
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:06,001
-Echizen is a school
library assistant,

388
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,634
and he loves hamburgers.

389
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:10,968
-Well, you've sure done
a great job already, sir!

390
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:13,101
-Next on "The Prince of Tennis."

391
00:21:13,134 --> 00:21:14,901
-Is the Tennis Court Burning Up?

392
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:18,034
-By the way, Seigaku
girls are super lovely.

393
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,568
-Oh, they sure are.
