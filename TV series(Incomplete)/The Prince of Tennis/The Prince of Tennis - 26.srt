1
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,977
[theme song]

2
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:24,657
-Echizen, why do
you play tennis?

3
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,624
Why?

4
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:27,124
Why?

5
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,324
-It's like this.

6
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,957
There's someone I have to beat.

7
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,657
-You play tennis
just because there's

8
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,657
someone you want to beat?

9
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,190
Are you satisfied
with that, Echizen?

10
00:01:50,224 --> 00:01:50,924
-What do you mean?

11
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,857
-What will you have afterwards?

12
00:02:08,124 --> 00:02:10,524
-Can't think about
that right now!

13
00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:14,257
I need to focus on--
[grunt] This challenge!

14
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,657
-Stop it, Tezuka!

15
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,924
You shouldn't hit
a drop shot yet!

16
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:58,924
-Echizen, see if
you can beat me.

17
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:02,590
-[laughs]

18
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:05,890
[bell ringing]

19
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,657
-[groans]

20
00:03:23,424 --> 00:03:24,424
-Hmph.

21
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:25,990
Time for the young
to leave their nest.

22
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,857
-The golden age of
Japanese tennis.

23
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,324
The legendary man who sent
shockwaves around the world.

24
00:03:38,357 --> 00:03:39,024
Nanjirou Echizen.

25
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:44,457
He's just like his father.

26
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,590
-What?

27
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:47,990
Are you saying that you
know Echizen's father?

28
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:49,124
-Yes.

29
00:03:49,157 --> 00:03:50,990
His father played on the
professional circuit.

30
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:52,057
-Really?

31
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,190
He was a pro?

32
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:55,224
What kind of a
tennis player was he?

33
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:57,090
Was he strong on
offense like Ryoma?

34
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:59,724
Did he overpower his opponents?

35
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:01,024
-An offensive player.

36
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,257
The word persevere was
not in his dictionary.

37
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,790
All he did was attack.

38
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:16,524
His play was totally flawless.

39
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:20,290
He had natural instincts and
speed and power to spare.

40
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:22,924
And most of all, he had
an extraordinary ability

41
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:23,890
to absorb.

42
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:25,657
-He was that great?

43
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,824
-He was.

44
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:28,124
He was one of a kind.

45
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:30,757
But he had an even rarer genius.

46
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,924
The truth is, Nanjirou Echizen
was a much greater monster

47
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:36,757
than I ever thought he was.

48
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,324
-Huh?

49
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:40,857
-I've decided I'm going to
start playing two sword style.

50
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:48,057
-You mean Nanjirou Echizen
figured out this two sword

51
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,557
style all by himself?

52
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,524
-Right.

53
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,890
And that's how he
was able to overcome

54
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,657
that weak backhand of his.

55
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,890
Exceptional tennis players are
able to overcome each and every

56
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:58,957
wall they encounter
in the same way.

57
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,490
That's the kind of boy
Echizen's father was.

58
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:11,024
-I finally understand.

59
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:12,024
-Huh?

60
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:13,357
Understand what?

61
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,690
-That it's Nanjirou
Echizen standing out

62
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:17,757
there on the court
before us right now.

63
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,324
His power, speed, reflexes.

64
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,990
He far exceeds most
players in all these areas.

65
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:30,857
His ability to take advantage
of his opponent's predictions

66
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,857
is also flawless.

67
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,957
Ryoma's tennis is a carbon
copy of Nanjirou Echizen's.

68
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,357
-It's unusual for you to
make such a strong assertion.

69
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:44,490
-But when Echizen manages to
climb over that wall, what will

70
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:45,657
he find?

71
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,690
It could make or
break him as a player.

72
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,190
-Hm.

73
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,890
I wonder.

74
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:54,057
-Hmph.

75
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,624
Whatever's beyond that
wall must wait for now.

76
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,990
-That's enough, Tezuka!

77
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:09,890
Don't hit any more drop shots!

78
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:11,524
Otherwise, your joint will--

79
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:16,057
-Come on, Echizen.

80
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,557
[horn]

81
00:06:41,524 --> 00:06:43,324
-I'm home.

82
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:44,957
-Hey there, kid.

83
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,224
You're back very late.

84
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:47,890
Did you have a date?

85
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:48,424
-Sort of.

86
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,357
-Well, I suppose he is
at that age, I guess.

87
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,257
-[sigh]

88
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,090
-[panting]

89
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,357
You're even better than I
thought you were, captain.

90
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,824
But I'm not going
to lose like this.

91
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:49,457
-Show me the kind of tennis that
only Ryoma Echizen can play.

92
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:57,890
Your own tennis.

93
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:21,157
-So you watched our game.

94
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,590
-I didn't think you'd be
playing at full power.

95
00:08:25,624 --> 00:08:27,790
What are you going to do
if your arm gets worse?

96
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:28,924
-You're overreacting.

97
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:31,057
The problem with my
joint is a small matter.

98
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,124
-Tezuka!

99
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:36,057
If you hadn't played hard,
you would have lost the match.

100
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,557
Am I right?

101
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,924
It just doesn't make any sense.

102
00:08:38,957 --> 00:08:41,490
Echizen's only just recovered
from his eye injury.

103
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:42,957
It would've been
much better if you

104
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,057
could have avoided playing
this sort of a match.

105
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,490
-We needed to play that match.

106
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:50,690
If I hadn't played
it seriously, then it

107
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:52,890
would have meant
absolutely nothing.

108
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:58,124
That's all that I
could do to help him.

109
00:08:58,157 --> 00:09:00,857
-Tezuka, do you
think Echizen will

110
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,324
be able to get through this?

111
00:09:02,357 --> 00:09:04,057
Even if it was for the
sake of his future,

112
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,524
he's probably in shock.

113
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:09,157
It looks like he's never
lost a match before.

114
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,524
Hey, are you listening, Tezuka?

115
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,390
-The game is over.

116
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,057
-Echizen, become the
pillar of Seigaku.

117
00:09:32,424 --> 00:09:33,690
-What?

118
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:36,690
The captain and
Echizen are off again?

119
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:37,457
-What's going on?

120
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,524
-Don't know.

121
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,024
-Hm.

122
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:42,190
-Hm?

123
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:42,957
-Hm.

124
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,090
Huh?

125
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:45,990
-Well, let's get ready
and start practicing.

126
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:48,857
Regulars, run around the
ground 10 times and the others

127
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,557
swing your rackets, now.

128
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,057
-Yes!

129
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,090
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER): Echizen,
become the pillar of Seigaku.

130
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,824
-Hey, dad?

131
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:36,857
-Seems you're home
rather early, young man.

132
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,490
Is there some
special reason why?

133
00:10:38,524 --> 00:10:40,757
What's going on?

134
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,657
-Let's play a game.

135
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:47,690
-It's very unusual for you
to be asking me for a game.

136
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:50,524
Perhaps you've finally
come to respect your daddy.

137
00:10:50,557 --> 00:10:52,657
-Know where Tezuka
is, Coach Ryuzaki?

138
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,157
-He went to the hospital.

139
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:54,857
-Hospital?

140
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,124
-Now, don't you worry.

141
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,924
The doctor's already
told me Tezuka

142
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,424
has made a full recovery.

143
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:01,790
I guess he just
wants to talk to him.

144
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:02,857
-Huh.

145
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,657
-I'm worried something's
wrong with Ryoma.

146
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,457
-It's not like him to miss
two days of practice in a row.

147
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,257
-I'll bet those two
know more about this

148
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,257
than they're letting on.

149
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:16,690
By the way, all of you are
in the same class with him.

150
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:18,190
Notice anything
different about him?

151
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:20,657
-It seemed like he was
his same old self today.

152
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,824
That makes me very
suspicious that he

153
00:11:22,857 --> 00:11:24,657
called in sick for practice.

154
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,257
-I Get.

155
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:25,924
The picture.

156
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:27,724
-Stop it, you guys.

157
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:29,524
At times like
these, upperclassmen

158
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:32,257
should give quiet support.

159
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,157
And outsiders
should just shut up.

160
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,057
-What did you say?

161
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,024
How dare you?

162
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:37,490
Are you challenging
me to a fight?

163
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:38,424
-[hiss]

164
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:39,224
-No, wait!

165
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:40,857
Calm down, Momoshiro!

166
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,824
-Something's going on
with the little guy.

167
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:43,924
-I guess so.

168
00:11:43,957 --> 00:11:45,757
The Metro Tournaments
are soon, but he's

169
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,457
missed two straight practices.

170
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,524
-There's only one
thing I can think of

171
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:51,190
to explain this situation.

172
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:52,124
-What's that, Inui?

173
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:53,524
Tell us, tell us.

174
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:54,657
-Hey, there's no rush.

175
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,690
Echizen will probably
give us the answer

176
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:58,490
when he shows up for
the Metro Tournaments.

177
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,257
-This is a serious match.

178
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,090
-OK by me.

179
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:10,024
How about I give you a handicap.

180
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:10,724
-Don't need it.

181
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,957
-Easy does it.

182
00:12:54,224 --> 00:12:55,390
-You underestimate me!

183
00:12:57,724 --> 00:12:59,090
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER):
Echizen, show

184
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:00,924
me your own kind of tennis.

185
00:13:00,957 --> 00:13:01,890
Ryoma Echizen's tennis.

186
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:18,657
-Your shot is
different than usual.

187
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,157
Back at you!

188
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,157
And again!

189
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,157
This boy.

190
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:37,624
-Ha.

191
00:13:37,657 --> 00:13:39,590
You still have a ways to go.

192
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,200
-Hello, Miss Ryuzaki.

193
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,400
-Oh, it's you, Mr. Inouye.

194
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:59,867
-I just visited Mr. Nanjiro.

195
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,500
-Really?

196
00:14:00,534 --> 00:14:01,967
You saw that bum?

197
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,967
And?

198
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,934
-Mr. Nanjiro told
me before that he

199
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:06,767
thought Ryoma was
missing something,

200
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,700
but he didn't say what it was.

201
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:10,300
-Ryoma's missing something?

202
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:11,100
-Yes.

203
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:12,334
I thought I figured it out.

204
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:14,734
In fact, I was pretty
sure I knew what it was,

205
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,834
but it turned out to
be something different.

206
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:19,500
--[laughs] So that's why you've
come down here to see me.

207
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:20,167
Is that it?

208
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,534
-Exactly.

209
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:25,367
I've come here to find out what
it is that Ryoma is missing.

210
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,834
-What Ryoma is missing, eh?

211
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,067
There's someone else who's
been talking about it.

212
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,534
The exact same thing.

213
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:32,234
-What?

214
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:33,867
And who might that be?

215
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:41,567
-He is someone who was closest
to the Nanjiro of the old days,

216
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,367
I think.

217
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,900
-Huh?

218
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,134
-Any pain?

219
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:49,867
-No, but I wanted you to have
a look at it to make sure

220
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,200
it's OK.

221
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:53,467
-It looks OK, but even
though it's healed,

222
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,967
if you overwork it, your efforts
to recover will be wasted.

223
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,034
-I understand that.

224
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,500
Thank you very much.

225
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:02,300
I don't want Oishi to
know about this visit.

226
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,734
-Yes, I understand.

227
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:06,900
It's not easy being captain
of the tennis team, is it?

228
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:08,667
-Well, I must be going.

229
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,767
-You use drop shots.

230
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,700
Am I right?

231
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,534
-I'm sorry?

232
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:16,667
-Why do you do it?

233
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,300
I think I have the right to ask.

234
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,767
After all, I am your doctor.

235
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,134
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER): Hit
the shot to me, Echizen.

236
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,000
Hit the kind of
shot I can't return.

237
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:38,934
Hit it to me, Echizen.

238
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:39,434
Hit it.

239
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:41,300
Hit it.

240
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:42,300
Hit it.

241
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:47,667
-A tennis player should
improve his abilities.

242
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,267
I think a young
player must establish

243
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,934
a new standard of tennis,
rather than just trying

244
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:55,800
to match up to a
former great player.

245
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:56,967
That's the reason.

246
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,100
I did what I had to do.

247
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,267
-Ryoma's tennis game is a
copy of Nanjiro Echizen's.

248
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,934
But he can't overtake
him as he is now.

249
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:53,434
There are many strong
players in the world.

250
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:56,200
I wanted to show
Echizen my tennis.

251
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,567
I needed to show
it to him in order

252
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,500
to get him to
improve his own game,

253
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:07,434
even if the price was high.

254
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:37,200
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): I'll
show you my kind of tennis.

255
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:38,700
My own tennis.

256
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,634
-Coming back!

257
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:09,900
-Echizen.

258
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:16,100
Become the pillar of Seigaku.

259
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,400
Hit the ball to me.

260
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,934
Hit a ball that I can't return.

261
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:26,167
-Huh?

262
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,234
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER): And move
your tennis game higher,

263
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:29,234
Echizen!

264
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:30,700
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): I'll hit it!

265
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:41,167
-[grunt]

266
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:47,100
-Yes!

267
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:53,567
[panting]

268
00:18:58,534 --> 00:19:00,067
Dad?

269
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,834
I want to be strong.

270
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:04,034
Much, much stronger.

271
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,400
-[laughs]

272
00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:13,434
Sending him to Seigaku
was the right thing.

273
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:17,334
I don't know who it was, but he
understood Ryoma's personality,

274
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:21,200
and he did exactly the
right thing for Ryoma.

275
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,667
And that is to motivate him.

276
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,867
You're looking very
pleased with yourself.

277
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,400
What happened?

278
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:36,400
-Nothing, really.

279
00:19:36,434 --> 00:19:37,734
I just want to play harder.

280
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,234
-This boy will
probably be reborn.

281
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:28,829
[theme song]

282
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:04,109
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): Hello.

283
00:21:04,142 --> 00:21:06,142
I'm Ryoma.

284
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:07,892
What Kalpin likes
most is taking a nap,

285
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:11,292
cat treats, and
playing with cat toys.

286
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:12,592
-[meow]

287
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:15,259
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): Hey,
don't follow me to school.

288
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:18,559
-[meowing]

289
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:21,292
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): How
did you get here, anyway?

290
00:21:21,326 --> 00:21:24,959
Next, on The Prince of
Tennis, "Kalpin's Adventure."

291
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:29,792
Hey, Kalpin, we still
have a ways to go, too.

292
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:33,326
-[meow]
