00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:14,207
ANNOUNCER: We are
approaching our last stop.

2
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:16,674
Please be sure to take
all of your belongings.

3
00:00:22,374 --> 00:00:23,241
-Wake up, kid.

4
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:24,741
We're at the last stop.

5
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,174
Come on.

6
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:27,174
-The last stop?

7
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:31,707
What?

8
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,141
This isn't my school.

9
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:35,007
Where am I?

10
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:41,874
[theme music]

11
00:01:53,148 --> 00:01:54,482
-Let's begin.

12
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:58,416
In English, the phrase I have
blank, is incredibly useful.

13
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:01,049
To have is a verb that
signifies possession.

14
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:05,549
I have, you have,
she has, they--

15
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,149
TEACHER (VOICEOVER): For crying
out loud, he's sleeping again.

16
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:09,716
Echizen, wake up.

17
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:12,416
Would you complete the
sentence on the board, please?

18
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:13,383
-Huh?

19
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,316
All right.

20
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:16,716
[yawn]

21
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:21,349
BOY (VOICEOVER): Echizen's
gonna make a fool of himself.

22
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:28,449
BOY: Whoa, how's
he gonna do that?

23
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:29,483
-Know what?

24
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:33,949
That's just-- That's
just not possible.

25
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:34,816
-I'm done.

26
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:35,749
That it?

27
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:37,383
-Yeah, that's it!

28
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,316
Nice job.

29
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:39,716
Well done.

30
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:41,183
Good answer, son.

31
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:45,449
-Your pronunciation's
not that bad, you know.

32
00:02:45,483 --> 00:02:46,816
-Tell me he didn't
just say that.

33
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:47,749
-No way.

34
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:53,616
-I overslept, and now I'm
at some strange school.

35
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:54,883
What?

36
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:58,116
Today's practice match?

37
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:59,183
I can't make it.

38
00:02:59,216 --> 00:03:01,983
It's already noon.

39
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,816
Do I have any idea where I am?

40
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:06,549
Not sure.

41
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,583
I could be anywhere.

42
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:10,649
Oh, I see it right here.

43
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:15,583
I figured out where I am, sir.

44
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:16,716
[beeping]

45
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:17,483
Sir?

46
00:03:17,516 --> 00:03:18,783
Darn.

47
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:20,016
I'm not getting any reception.

48
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:26,583
Here's my big chance.

49
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:28,049
I'll go and check
out their team.

50
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:41,483
-One, two.

51
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:42,949
-You know where Echizen is?

52
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:45,449
-Oh, uh, he said he was
on the cleaning crew

53
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:46,583
today, so he'd be late.

54
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:48,183
Same deal for Horio.

55
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:49,449
-So then--

56
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:50,383
-That punk.

57
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,816
I bet he forgot
to do his homework

58
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:53,949
and so he had to stay late.

59
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,449
-Kikumaru, you sure
that's not you?

60
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:56,383
-What?

61
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,716
Hey, you're out
of your mind, pal.

62
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:07,116
-Cool.

63
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:08,783
So, this is Seigaku, huh?

64
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:15,349
Hey, not bad.

65
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:18,549
Come to think of
it, where's Tezuka?

66
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,016
Huh?

67
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:22,816
-That's fantastic, Fuji.

68
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:24,016
Great, looks terrific.

69
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:25,983
Just perfect.

70
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:26,983
-Who's that?

71
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,816
Is she another scout?

72
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,016
-Hold that pose.

73
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:33,483
BOY: She actually looks
kind of old for scouting.

74
00:04:33,516 --> 00:04:35,716
-Hm?

75
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:37,549
-Did you just call me old?

76
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,249
Now listen.

77
00:04:39,283 --> 00:04:41,016
You may only be in
junior high school,

78
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:43,983
but that doesn't give you
any right to insult a lady.

79
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:46,249
[phone ringing]

80
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:47,816
-Hello.

81
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:48,883
Oh really?

82
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:49,749
Ah!

83
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:52,383
I don't believe it.

84
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,316
Yeah, yeah!

85
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:53,983
I got it.

86
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:56,716
I'll be there soon!

87
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:58,583
An unexpected
emergency has come up

88
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:00,216
that I've gotta
go and deal with.

89
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:03,416
Next time, try to
be more polite.

90
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:04,383
-Uh.

91
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,083
-You're in big trouble, mister.

92
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:09,683
Oh, I gotta go.

93
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:11,583
-What a weird lady.

94
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:13,483
Now, I wonder where
I can find Tezuka.

95
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:15,983
Hm.

96
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,616
Hm?

97
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:18,749
-Hey there.

98
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:20,483
I don't think you go to
Seigaku, do you, pal?

99
00:05:20,516 --> 00:05:21,616
What are you up to?

100
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:22,449
-Nothing.

101
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:24,849
What's it to you?

102
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:27,383
Uh, well, since I'm busted.

103
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,383
I'm the famous
eighth grade top gun

104
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,883
at Rikkai Junior High School.

105
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:36,083
The famous Akaya Kirihara.

106
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:38,516
-Rikkai Junior High School, huh?

107
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:42,083
They're the best team
in the Kanto region.

108
00:05:42,116 --> 00:05:45,416
They won the Kanegawa Prefecture
Regional Preliminaries

109
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:49,049
in a total of one hour.

110
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,749
-That's pretty weird.

111
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:56,683
Why is Kanegawa's
best here at Seigaku?

112
00:05:56,716 --> 00:06:00,516
-Well, I just thought
I'd spy a little.

113
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:01,616
-Spying?

114
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:02,116
-Spying?

115
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:10,783
GIRL: I can't believe
you lived in America.

116
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:12,383
-It's so awesome.

117
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,849
Was everyone just totally
different over there,

118
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:16,649
or were people
basically the same?

119
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:17,683
-No, the same.

120
00:06:17,716 --> 00:06:18,683
-Hey, you know what?

121
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:21,016
I've been taking
English for two years.

122
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:23,316
-We weren't asking you, Horio.

123
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,183
Now then, what were you
just talking about, Ryoma?

124
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:28,283
So, did everybody
there have a pool?

125
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:31,683
-Hey, I used to take
swimming lessons, you know.

126
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:33,249
-Be quiet.

127
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:33,883
-Man.

128
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,116
This stinks.

129
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:39,016
Just 'cause Ryoma used
to live in America.

130
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:39,716
-Huh?

131
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:40,849
-Hey, throw me the ball.

132
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:44,083
Over here, man.

133
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:44,583
-Here!

134
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:50,016
Hey, pass it here.

135
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:51,316
-Excuse me.

136
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:52,183
I, uh--

137
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,349
-What was that, huh?

138
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:01,549
Come on, tell me.

139
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,716
-Hey, Kazu, what's the matter?

140
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:07,949
-I, uh-- Well-- this punk
clocked me with his broom

141
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:08,649
on purpose.

142
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:09,149
-Uh.

143
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:09,649
Uh.

144
00:07:09,683 --> 00:07:10,649
-Really?

145
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:12,916
He's got guts, hitting
an upperclassman

146
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:14,983
on purpose like that.

147
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:17,483
-Hey loser, do you
really think saying

148
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:19,883
you're sorry is enough
after you hit me in the head

149
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,783
with a broom?

150
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,649
-Well, I-- I don't
know what to say.

151
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:27,949
I honestly didn't intend
to hit you like that.

152
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:29,849
I sweat I really didn't.

153
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:33,283
-Kazu, this kid just
said he didn't hit you.

154
00:07:33,316 --> 00:07:34,649
-Yeah.

155
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:36,416
Certainly sounds like this kid
thinks he's innocent to me.

156
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:37,849
Who does he think he is?

157
00:07:37,883 --> 00:07:38,849
-That's not it.

158
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:40,383
What do you want me to do?

159
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,449
I'll do anything you want.

160
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:43,049
Please don't hurt me.

161
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,783
-Anything, huh?

162
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:45,283
-Hm.

163
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,683
-Huh?

164
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:55,316
-I think I have something
you could do to pay me back.

165
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:59,483
I shoot, and if I happen to hit
anything other than the can,

166
00:07:59,516 --> 00:08:01,383
we'll let you off
the hook this time.

167
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:11,883
-Hey man, let us try too.

168
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,083
-You bet.

169
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:15,349
Free lunch for the
guy who nails it.

170
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:16,383
Hmph.

171
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,383
So don't run away, kid.

172
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:18,883
Got it?

173
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:25,083
I can't hit a target
if it's not even there.

174
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:30,049
MAN: Hey, you over there!

175
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,449
-Huh?

176
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:33,783
-Huh?

177
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:35,816
-Glad to see you, sir.

178
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:36,983
Horio needs you.

179
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:37,916
-Huh?

180
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:39,710
What about Horio

181
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,049
-S-Spy?

182
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:04,249
-What's he thinking
coming here like that?

183
00:09:04,283 --> 00:09:07,016
That jerk's clowning us.

184
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:09,616
-Arai?

185
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,683
-Hey, what's going on here?

186
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:13,683
-Wow, I found you.

187
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:15,616
You're Tezuka, right?

188
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:18,016
My teammates all
talk about a you.

189
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:20,649
You were the only person to
beat our team at the Kanto

190
00:09:20,683 --> 00:09:22,949
Tournament last year.

191
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:24,216
-H--Hey.

192
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:25,116
How about this.

193
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,183
Could I have a match with you?

194
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:29,583
I'll go easy.

195
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:32,149
-There's no outsiders
allowed here.

196
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:34,783
-Hm.

197
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:36,616
Aw, come on, Tezuka.

198
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,349
Just play me a set.

199
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:39,683
Don't be a jerk.

200
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:41,749
If you keep frowning,
it'll stick.

201
00:09:41,783 --> 00:09:43,316
Lighten up, man.

202
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,183
You're so serious.

203
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:49,016
-Hey.

204
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:51,183
Don't you dare be
rude to our captain.

205
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,716
Get out of here.

206
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:54,216
-Idiot.

207
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:10,237
-Why don't you mind
your own business?

208
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:18,297
-He returned my serve.

209
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,697
-Come on, Tezuka.

210
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,430
I'm not trying to
prove anything to you.

211
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:25,030
I'm just asking you to hit a
couple of balls with me, that's

212
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:26,163
all.

213
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:29,730
You're not gonna hurt
my feelings, are you?

214
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:30,930
I'll work you.

215
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,563
Kidding.

216
00:10:36,597 --> 00:10:38,797
You don't have to play if
you don't really want to.

217
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,863
Hey.

218
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:41,230
You over there.

219
00:10:41,263 --> 00:10:42,097
Here comes your ball.

220
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:47,063
-Yes.

221
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:47,897
Looking good.

222
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:54,797
-Hm?

223
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:59,163
-What's this?

224
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:00,630
-Hey, wait a m--

225
00:11:08,897 --> 00:11:09,363
-Huh?

226
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:13,330
-Oh no.

227
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:15,363
This is not good.

228
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:17,497
[hissing]

229
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,197
-Somebody's dead.

230
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,630
-Kaidoh just snapped.

231
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:26,563
[shouting]

232
00:11:26,597 --> 00:11:29,030
KAIDOH: Show me who did this.

233
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,230
Who's responsible?

234
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:33,363
[shouting]

235
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:34,397
-Hold it, I'm first.

236
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,930
KAIDOH: You keep out of this.

237
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:37,730
-Hey, you two, stop it!

238
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:42,397
-Everyone, 30 laps.

239
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,697
-Aw, come on.

240
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,197
Man!

241
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,997
No way!

242
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:53,563
-Ha!

243
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:54,797
Scorching.

244
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,730
That was nine shoots in a row.

245
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:57,930
All right.

246
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:00,030
You owe me lunch.

247
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:01,330
-That's not good.

248
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:04,530
Kazu's free throws are
getting better and better.

249
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:06,930
-Yeah.

250
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:08,863
-That's eight lunches.

251
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:13,130
Nobody can beat
me at free throws.

252
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:15,230
-Ah, finished.

253
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:15,730
-Huh?

254
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:21,697
-Echizen, let's get
changed and get out here!

255
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,397
Yes!

256
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,463
It's time for tennis.

257
00:12:24,497 --> 00:12:26,530
Takako, Kumako!

258
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:28,997
How long are you gonna
take to finish up?

259
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,197
-Why are you bugging us?

260
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,263
-Talk about mood swings.

261
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:33,797
You were just crying
a little while ago.

262
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,997
-Shut up.

263
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,463
Hurry up and finish cleaning.

264
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,663
-Hey.

265
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:48,030
Looks like the kid's
still got his broom.

266
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:50,530
I bet you think you
got away with it.

267
00:12:53,697 --> 00:12:57,130
Now we'll even the score, kid.

268
00:12:57,163 --> 00:12:58,530
-No, not now.

269
00:12:58,563 --> 00:13:03,230
Actually, I have to
go to tennis practice.

270
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:05,030
-You think I care?

271
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:07,697
-Yeah, you said you'd
do anything, didn't you?

272
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,297
-You stay right
here 'til I say so.

273
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,463
-Oh, please, sir.

274
00:13:12,497 --> 00:13:13,863
Please don't kill me.

275
00:13:13,897 --> 00:13:14,630
I'm so sorry.

276
00:13:21,763 --> 00:13:23,430
-That's it.

277
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:25,197
-This is bad.

278
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:25,997
-What should we do?

279
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,563
-Hey.

280
00:13:29,597 --> 00:13:30,063
-Huh?

281
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:35,897
-You guys made that
mess, so I think

282
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,397
you should clean it up now.

283
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,197
-Oh, Ehizen.

284
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,597
-What?

285
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,663
-Hey, who's this?

286
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,263
-You've got a broom.

287
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:47,130
Why don't you clean
it up yourself, huh?

288
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,063
Butt out, pal.

289
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,397
Who do you think you are?

290
00:13:55,363 --> 00:13:58,063
It's quite Obvious
I guess nobody's

291
00:13:58,097 --> 00:14:01,297
bothered to train these
seventh graders yet.

292
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,163
Disrespecting us like that.

293
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:08,563
Just go back to work and nobody
gets into anymore trouble.

294
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:18,497
You're history.

295
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:28,663
Hm?

296
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:38,130
-No sweat.

297
00:14:38,163 --> 00:14:39,597
That's not so hard.

298
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,697
-Why you little--

299
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,297
-Whoa.

300
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,963
-So cool.

301
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:45,430
-Big deal.

302
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:47,563
Free throws are easy, right?

303
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:49,030
-What's with him?

304
00:14:49,063 --> 00:14:51,230
-Hey, I got an idea.

305
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:53,763
Let's shoot 10 each.

306
00:14:53,797 --> 00:14:55,930
I dare you.

307
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,597
-10 shots in a row?

308
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,197
-You're challenging
us at free throws?

309
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,763
-Is this guy crazy?

310
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:03,397
With a broom?

311
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,897
-OK.

312
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,897
You lose, then you'll
be eating asphalt along

313
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,930
with that other
seventh grade dirtbag.

314
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:16,563
-And if you lose, then you
and your little friends

315
00:15:16,597 --> 00:15:17,263
get to clean up.

316
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:18,830
How's that?

317
00:15:18,863 --> 00:15:21,730
-Hm.

318
00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:23,497
-Where could he be?

319
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,263
Echizen's late.

320
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:29,530
Huh?

321
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:30,530
-All right, Kazu.

322
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:31,630
Nice shot.

323
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:32,130
-Yeah.

324
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,630
-It's your turn, wonderboy.

325
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:44,063
-Two points!

326
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:47,130
-I knew he was great at
tennis, but still, how did--

327
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:48,797
-He sunk it with a broom.

328
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:54,997
BOY: Nice shot.

329
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,897
BOY: All right.

330
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:58,397
-Hey.

331
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,363
-Hm?

332
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:00,730
-Do you think I
can move back some?

333
00:16:00,763 --> 00:16:03,330
It's kind of hard
to shoot this close.

334
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:03,830
-Huh?

335
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:11,697
GIRLS: He made it.

336
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:32,363
-Awesome.

337
00:16:32,397 --> 00:16:34,863
-Neither one's missed yet.

338
00:16:34,897 --> 00:16:35,563
-Hey guys.

339
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:36,430
Something's going on.

340
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:37,297
This looks good.

341
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:37,797
-All right!

342
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,463
-Come on!

343
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,463
-Let's check it out.

344
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:40,730
-The eighth grade
basketball star's

345
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:42,697
going up against some seventh
grader at free throws.

346
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,497
-No way.

347
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,597
-Hey, would you look at this?

348
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,263
Everybody's come to
watch the shoot out.

349
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,797
-And they're even watching
from inside the classrooms.

350
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,230
-Man, you see that?

351
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:52,963
That little squirt
keeps on stepping back,

352
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:55,763
but his shots just keep
getting better and better.

353
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:57,697
-And that's putting a
lot of pressure on Kazu.

354
00:17:04,563 --> 00:17:06,797
KAZU (VOICEOVER): Why
am I being so impatient?

355
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,497
Argh.

356
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,597
That's just not like me.

357
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,530
There's no way I
can miss this shot.

358
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:19,730
The star basketball player
can't lose at free throws.

359
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:23,630
Not to a brat like him.

360
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:24,563
-Oh, man!

361
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:33,630
-It's not possible!

362
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:35,130
-Yes, he missed it!

363
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:37,030
-If Echizen sinks this, he wins.

364
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,397
-Huh?

365
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:46,497
-I can't believe how far
back Echizen is going.

366
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:51,363
-So, you're gonna take it
from the baseline, huh, Ryoma?

367
00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:53,263
-Need this, don't you?

368
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,330
-Hey, thanks.

369
00:17:58,363 --> 00:17:59,030
You're a pal.

370
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,530
-I think he must be the seventh
grade tennis star everyone

371
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:16,997
talks about.

372
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:20,963
-Whoa.

373
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:22,930
-That's just awesome.

374
00:18:22,963 --> 00:18:25,397
-He even made a swish.

375
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,897
He did it!

376
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,863
Echizen beat him!

377
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:28,563
-Wow!

378
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:30,097
That seventh grader won!

379
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:34,830
-Hey.

380
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,063
Hate to say this.

381
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:40,297
You have a ways to go.

382
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:52,697
-So, Rikkai's Kirihara was here.

383
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,897
-Yes, he was.

384
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,030
-They sure are a powerhouse.

385
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:59,430
If we continue to win, we'll
probably end up playing them.

386
00:18:59,463 --> 00:19:01,230
We're gonna need to
strengthen the team,

387
00:19:01,263 --> 00:19:03,030
don't you think, Tezuka?

388
00:19:03,063 --> 00:19:04,963
-I agree with you.

389
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:08,363
But first, we've got to
begin our ranking matches,

390
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,997
to be prepared for
the Kanto tournament.

391
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,430
-You're right.

392
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:14,963
We'll have to start thinking
about the schedule and line

393
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:15,497
up too.

394
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:21,263
-Hm hm hm.

395
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,597
This is a huge campus.

396
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,530
I'm so lost.

397
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,530
I'm sorry.

398
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:33,630
Are you OK?

399
00:19:33,663 --> 00:19:34,830
You sure?

400
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:36,897
Hey, do you play tennis?

401
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,463
I don't know.

402
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:40,297
OK.

403
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,663
Well, I have this Seigaku ball.

404
00:19:42,697 --> 00:19:45,130
Hey kid, do you think you
could return this ball?

405
00:19:51,963 --> 00:19:52,497
-Thanks.

406
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,863
-Hm.

407
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:58,430
Seigaku, huh?

408
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:03,897
ANNOUNCER: Next stop,
Rikkai Junior High.

409
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,197
Next stop, Rikkai Junior High.

410
00:20:09,697 --> 00:20:11,730
-I can't believe it.

411
00:20:11,763 --> 00:20:15,130
Looks like that kid
has overslept again.

412
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,230
Young man.

413
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,897
You're headed to the
end of the line again.

414
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,597
Young man.

415
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,697
Wake up.

416
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,843
[theme music]

417
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,277
RYUZAKI: Sumire Ryuzaki here.

418
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,977
Firstly, I wanna
congratulate you

419
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,510
all for doing such a great job
at the Metropolitan Tournament.

420
00:21:02,543 --> 00:21:05,277
Exactly what I
expected of Seigaku.

421
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,710
However, the Kanto Tournament
is a whole new bag.

422
00:21:08,743 --> 00:21:10,910
There's gonna be a lot
of top level players.

423
00:21:10,943 --> 00:21:13,510
Therefore, those who
are not up to snuff

424
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:15,977
will be eliminated
from the regular team.

425
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,843
The ranking matches
will decide everything.

426
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:23,143
Next on "The Prince of
Tennis," A Seigaku Tradition.
