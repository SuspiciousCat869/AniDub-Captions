1
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:07,822
-Huh?

2
00:00:07,855 --> 00:00:08,962
It's a snake shot!

3
00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:15,996
-Looks like Saint Rudolph was
expecting a boomerang snake.

4
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:17,896
-Now's your chance, guys.

5
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:19,029
-A lob?

6
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:21,496
How many times did I
tell them not to hit one?

7
00:00:33,362 --> 00:00:36,296
-Look how high Momoshiro gets.

8
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,762
-Momo's timing
couldn't be better.

9
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:46,662
-Yeah!

10
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:47,162
There!

11
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:53,029
ANNOUNCER: Game to Seigaku.

12
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:54,432
Five games to three.

13
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:57,432
[theme music]

14
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:27,192
-Yeah, let's go, Momoshiro!

15
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:34,892
-There's his snake shot!

16
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:48,558
-It's his boomerang snake!

17
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:50,025
ANNOUNCER: 15-Love.

18
00:02:50,058 --> 00:02:52,958
[cheering]

19
00:02:56,892 --> 00:02:58,625
-Not too bad, Kaidoh.

20
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:00,858
-You're in no place to say that.

21
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:03,792
Just stay out of the way, OK?

22
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:04,825
-Viper.

23
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:06,625
Don't get too cocky.

24
00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:07,825
Big mistake.

25
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:08,458
-Huh?

26
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:09,658
Say that again.

27
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:10,925
-Hey!

28
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,158
-Leave me alone.

29
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,325
I don't wanna see your ugly
face around here again.

30
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:16,725
-You're the one who's
getting in my way.

31
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:19,292
-You better take
that back, you loser.

32
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:22,092
The way you do things
has always bugged me.

33
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,692
-What about you?

34
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:24,758
I don't know why I--

35
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:26,925
-At first they may
look a bit mismatched.

36
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,325
They're not.

37
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:31,758
I believe the sum of the parts
is even greater than the whole.

38
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:35,592
-It seems like
Seigaku's winning now.

39
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:40,092
I really don't like how
it's going, Captain Akazawa.

40
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,958
-Kaneda, come on,
think about it.

41
00:03:42,992 --> 00:03:45,958
Yunagasawa and
Kisaru are golden.

42
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,158
They always come through
for us in a crunch.

43
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:52,692
And that is why those guys
have won all their games.

44
00:03:52,725 --> 00:03:53,758
BOY (VOICEOVER): Darn.

45
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:56,692
That's some kinda
secret weapon he has.

46
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:58,658
[hissing]

47
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:05,258
-He can only do that if
the ball is near the line.

48
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:11,425
In other words, if I place
my shot near the center line,

49
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,992
he can't curve it
around the pole.

50
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:17,592
-That's it.

51
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,292
It looks like he's
playing in the middle

52
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,825
to cut off the boomerang snake.

53
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:28,125
BOY: This is bad, Kaidoh.

54
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:30,758
-Winning like that--
that's no fun.

55
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:39,725
-Come on!

56
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:40,725
-That's cool.

57
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,525
-Huh?

58
00:04:45,558 --> 00:04:46,358
-You chump.

59
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:47,958
We wanted you to make that shot.

60
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:57,358
-He's not-- The lob's
got a slice rotation.

61
00:04:57,392 --> 00:04:59,225
It hangs in the air and
moves with the wind.

62
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:02,858
It's too hard to hit
a dunk smash off that.

63
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:04,358
-No way you could smash that.

64
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:08,092
-Hm.

65
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,358
I Huh?

66
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,225
What the-- I can't believe
how high that guy jumps.

67
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:14,225
And his balance.

68
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,192
-Here it comes.

69
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:20,225
I'm gonna play it anyway.

70
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,458
-Straight down the line.

71
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,158
It's mine.

72
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,125
Huh?

73
00:05:29,158 --> 00:05:30,592
The ball's kicking out!

74
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,558
-No way!

75
00:05:46,558 --> 00:05:47,025
-Huh?

76
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:51,192
-Hmph.

77
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,758
-What did he do?

78
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:54,092
What just happened?

79
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:54,992
-Who knows?

80
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:56,458
It's bad.

81
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:58,925
-Looks like Momo just
cleaned his clock.

82
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,625
The ball took a weird
hop, sure enough.

83
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:06,958
-Hey.

84
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:07,725
Yanagisawa.

85
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:10,725
Yanagisawa!

86
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:12,892
-Is that player going to be OK?

87
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:15,325
-Yanagisawa!

88
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:17,592
-I see four refs.

89
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,158
Why do we need them?

90
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:21,458
-It's not good.

91
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:24,392
I'm afraid he's
done for the day.

92
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,258
-Yeah, I guess you're right.

93
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,458
-He can't play.

94
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:30,225
No way he can go on after
taking a hit like that.

95
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:32,258
BOY: You think he's
gonna be all right?

96
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,125
-That was some smash.

97
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:35,592
Did you see that?

98
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,625
Seigaku rocks.

99
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:41,258
-Hey, Yanagisawa, this
really isn't the best way

100
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:43,225
to concede a tennis match.

101
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:46,225
Hey, come on and
finish up, all right?

102
00:06:46,258 --> 00:06:47,158
Hm?

103
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:51,058
This is no time to quit.

104
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:53,892
Hey, wait a second!

105
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:55,558
ANNOUNCER: St. Rudolph defaults.

106
00:06:55,592 --> 00:06:57,258
Win to Seigaku.

107
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,092
[cheering]

108
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:04,758
-Boy oh boy.

109
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,925
Wasn't that a surprising ending?

110
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:12,625
-Those two guys, they never
do things the normal way.

111
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:16,125
-Strange things sure do happen.

112
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:17,525
-Huh?

113
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:19,092
Hey, wait.

114
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:19,925
Aw!

115
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:20,958
But I'm still itching to play.

116
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:22,225
Come on, man.

117
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:23,192
Oh, no no no.

118
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,158
-Jerk.

119
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:25,125
-Hey!

120
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:28,092
I haven't burned
off this energy yet.

121
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,025
Hey, come on!

122
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:29,592
Don't go!

123
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,992
Where you going?

124
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:31,992
Please, come on.

125
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:34,258
-Let go of me.

126
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:38,092
-Momoshiro's jumping dunk smash
sure was incredible, wasn't it?

127
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,592
-Yeah, it really smoked.

128
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,625
If things go like
this, Seigaku's

129
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:43,625
gonna win straight through.

130
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:45,325
-You have a point.

131
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:47,892
Seigaku's golden pair's up next.

132
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,658
There's absolutely no way that
Oishi and Kigumaru will lose.

133
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,692
-Oh, come on.

134
00:07:57,725 --> 00:07:59,158
This stinks a lot.

135
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:00,825
An awful lot.

136
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:03,492
Man, that guy just ran away.

137
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,625
-No he didn't.

138
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:06,425
You hit him in the face
with a ball, you idiot.

139
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,192
-Shut up.

140
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:08,725
I didn't mean to hit him.

141
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:09,958
-Argh.

142
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:11,825
-So now, tell me straight.

143
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,258
-He's fine.

144
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,458
He's just exhausted.

145
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:16,892
Man, it's so frustrating.

146
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:18,992
They really had momentum.

147
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,758
If he just weren't hit.

148
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,558
-It was the wrong place
at the wrong time.

149
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:25,258
-No, you're wrong.

150
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,892
They kept improving their game.

151
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:29,058
We just didn't give
them enough credit.

152
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,458
They were really that good.

153
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:30,958
-Hm.

154
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:34,625
Hm?

155
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:35,892
Mizuki.

156
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:38,092
-Stop making excuses.

157
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:42,058
If you guys had listened,
you could have won.

158
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:45,258
That was disgraceful.

159
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,392
Captain.

160
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,492
We can never ever allow
that to happen again.

161
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:51,825
-Mizuki.

162
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:53,458
Don't worry.

163
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,725
I'll show them.

164
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:58,025
I'll give them a little
taste of my backhand.

165
00:08:58,058 --> 00:09:02,192
We'll trash Seigaku's
golden pair.

166
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:03,058
-That sounds good.

167
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:07,625
ANNOUNCER: Seigaku
and St. Rudolph number

168
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:11,092
one doubles players, please
come to center court.

169
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,025
-Come on, let's go.

170
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:15,292
-Yeah, let's take
these guys apart.

171
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:15,792
-Right.

172
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,458
ANNOUNCER: This is
the second match

173
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:23,225
of the semifinals of
Block D. Number one

174
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:24,125
doubles to the court.

175
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:44,192
-Eiji, here we go.

176
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:44,658
-OK.

177
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:49,358
-I'm gonna have fun
with you, Eiji Kikumaru.

178
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:02,492
BOY: Did you hear?

179
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:04,858
Yuuta Fuji of St.
Rudolph is playing today.

180
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:06,125
BOY: No way.

181
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:08,558
Are you talking about
the lefty killer?

182
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:09,792
BOY: Yeah.

183
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:11,892
He was practicing for a
match with Seigaku's Tezuka,

184
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:13,792
but there was some
mistake and now he's

185
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:16,492
gonna be playing some
seventh grade regular.

186
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:17,492
BOY: really?

187
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:20,192
That'll have Seigaku
in a real pinch.

188
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:22,358
BOY: So the seventh
grader's a lefty too?

189
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:23,392
-Huh?

190
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:25,258
BOY: Actually he is.

191
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,092
BOY: Wow.

192
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,792
It's going from bad to worse.

193
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:29,058
-Oh well.

194
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:31,658
If I've gotta play a
south paw, at least

195
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:34,592
I should face
McEnroe in his prime.

196
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,325
-Oh, there he is!

197
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:37,558
-Ryoma!

198
00:10:37,592 --> 00:10:39,758
-Hey, what are you doing here?

199
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:42,292
-Please, Horio, get me a drink.

200
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,258
-Not right now.

201
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:44,692
There's no time for that.

202
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:47,058
-Look, Oishi and
Kikumaru are in deep.

203
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:47,558
-Hm?

204
00:10:53,492 --> 00:10:56,425
[whispering]

205
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:04,958
-Game to St. Rudolph.

206
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:06,658
That makes two games to Love.

207
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:08,658
St. Rudolph leads.

208
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:12,092
[gasping]

209
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:16,158
-They broke the golden
pair on their serve.

210
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,558
-Yikes.

211
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:21,425
-What's the big surprise?

212
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,892
It's all part of the plan.

213
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:41,488
-It looks like
those guys are only

214
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:43,722
returning balls to Kikumaru.

215
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:45,922
-Looks like they're trying
their hardest to break up

216
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:50,288
the golden pair so they're
only hitting the one player.

217
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:51,522
-What a pain.

218
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:54,155
They're forcing me
to hit shots I hate.

219
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:57,388
Well then, here.

220
00:11:57,422 --> 00:11:59,022
-I get it.

221
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:03,022
He's purposely moving around the
ball to excuse his best shots.

222
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,622
I respect his talent, but
it won't work forever.

223
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:16,055
-Whoa, diving volley.

224
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:20,355
ANNOUNCER: Out.

225
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:22,955
15-Love.

226
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:25,388
-That was a close call.

227
00:12:25,422 --> 00:12:26,988
-Hey, Eiji.

228
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:28,322
Don't worry.

229
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:29,988
I know that they're pounding
everything they've got at you.

230
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:31,155
Stay calm.

231
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:32,888
I promise I'll cover your back.

232
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:33,855
We'll do this together.

233
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:38,922
Eiji?

234
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:39,855
-Huh?

235
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:41,288
I'm good.

236
00:12:41,322 --> 00:12:43,855
All right, let's take it back.

237
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,455
I can do it.

238
00:12:46,488 --> 00:12:47,955
-Yeah.

239
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:49,388
-This isn't good.

240
00:12:49,422 --> 00:12:52,155
Eiji's losing his concentration.

241
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,222
Usually, Eiji
focuses better when

242
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:57,188
they keep hitting
the ball at him.

243
00:12:57,222 --> 00:12:57,888
What's up?

244
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:13,988
-I don't think it's possible
that our golden pair of Oishi

245
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:17,088
and Kikumaru can
just lose like that.

246
00:13:17,122 --> 00:13:19,588
-Looks like they're
wearing Kikumaru down.

247
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:20,888
Hang in there, golden pair!

248
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:28,022
-I think Eiji's
losing his focus.

249
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:34,388
ANNOUNCER: 30-Love.

250
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:36,088
-There's too many
unforced errors.

251
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:36,922
-No.

252
00:13:36,955 --> 00:13:38,222
-Ryoma.

253
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:40,822
Do you think Akazawa's pressure
could be too much for him?

254
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:43,155
-Yes, but that's not all.

255
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:44,655
-Inui.

256
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:46,988
-Akazawa is a great
singles player,

257
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:50,122
but he's not used to doubles.

258
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:52,222
Looks like they're
up to something.

259
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,222
There appears to be
another reason for this.

260
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:07,455
-Captain.

261
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:07,955
-OK.

262
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:15,088
RYOMA: You know, it looks
like there are at least five

263
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:16,155
or six balls.

264
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:16,688
-Hm?

265
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:17,988
What's that?

266
00:14:18,022 --> 00:14:19,655
Did you see something?

267
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:22,088
-Whenever the bigger
St. Rudolph guy hits.

268
00:14:35,822 --> 00:14:37,555
-That's it.

269
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:40,088
Whenever Akazawa
hits a backhand,

270
00:14:40,122 --> 00:14:43,755
he has the strange habit of
using the top of the racket.

271
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:47,355
It's not the sweet spot at
the edge of the racket head.

272
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:51,688
So it hits harder
on the strings.

273
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:55,422
In the process, that ball picks
up an awful lot of movement.

274
00:14:55,455 --> 00:15:00,022
The average person
simply cannot track it.

275
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:03,155
But Kikumaru has a
keen sense of movement.

276
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:06,022
His eyes track every
movement of the ball.

277
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,822
It is a gift as well as a curse.

278
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:17,555
-My eyes really hurt.

279
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:18,688
-I'll bet.

280
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:19,455
-No way.

281
00:15:19,488 --> 00:15:21,022
You really see five balls?

282
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:23,255
I see only one.

283
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,222
-One, two.

284
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:29,055
I see eight.

285
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:29,888
ANNOUNCER: Net ball.

286
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:32,255
40-Love.

287
00:15:32,288 --> 00:15:36,555
-In this humidity, they are
pounding so hard on Kikumaru

288
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:39,722
to force the shots
he hates to return.

289
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:43,188
Add in this blur shot, and
they're wearing him out,

290
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:45,488
mentally as well as physically.

291
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:53,222
So then what you've really
been trying to say is that--

292
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:56,722
-Kikumaru's been seen a
bunch of balls, right?

293
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,122
-His great eyesight's
killing him.

294
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:00,388
That just stinks.

295
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:01,655
-So that's it.

296
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:03,588
They have their
singles ace playing

297
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:07,122
doubles so he can
wear down Kikurmaru.

298
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:11,555
They weakened Kikumaru's sharp
eyes with Akazawa's blur shot.

299
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:14,322
St. Rudolph's manager
Mizuki came up

300
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:18,022
with a diabolical
anti-Kikumaru strategy.

301
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:21,155
-It's way too late
for you now, Inui.

302
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,422
Kikumaru is already
falling apart.

303
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:28,888
There's a limit to how long
someone can concentrate.

304
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:32,688
Kikumaru already reached his.

305
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:33,188
-Huh?

306
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:44,155
-Kikumaru may pull through.

307
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:46,088
He can concentrate.

308
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:49,122
-I hope they're called the
golden pair for a reason.

309
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:51,955
-Huh?

310
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:54,255
[excited chatter]

311
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:55,122
BOY: All right.

312
00:16:55,155 --> 00:16:56,522
We're practicing doubles today.

313
00:16:56,555 --> 00:16:59,488
Momoshiro Echizen
versus Oishi Kikumaru.

314
00:16:59,522 --> 00:17:00,488
Hit the court.

315
00:17:00,522 --> 00:17:01,755
-Sure.

316
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:02,722
BOY: Doubles?

317
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:03,388
Me?

318
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,888
BOY: Quit complaining.

319
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:05,622
BOY: Oh, man.

320
00:17:05,655 --> 00:17:06,855
I don't like doubles.

321
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:07,888
BOY: What's the big deal?

322
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:08,755
Get on the court.

323
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:12,922
-Huh?

324
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:15,455
-What the-- What is this?

325
00:17:15,488 --> 00:17:17,255
-Practice with the
rope, rookie, and it

326
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:20,088
will help out your doubles game.

327
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,588
-This is weird.

328
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:26,355
-No problem at all.

329
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:27,355
Got it.

330
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:36,322
-Echizen, don't pull so hard.

331
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,188
-Uh, OK.

332
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:37,688
-Huh?

333
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:43,188
-Kikumaru Beam!

334
00:17:43,222 --> 00:17:44,322
-Whoa.

335
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,222
And that's why they call
them the golden pair.

336
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:48,355
-Their teamwork is so perfect.

337
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:49,955
-And look at that.

338
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:51,655
Their rope isn't tangled at all.

339
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:56,222
-Hm.

340
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:58,288
-You can see Oishi's style.

341
00:17:58,322 --> 00:17:59,322
-Huh?

342
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:01,088
-He watches the
whole court closely

343
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,655
and controls the
opponent's pace.

344
00:18:04,688 --> 00:18:06,422
Just like a chess
player who cautiously

345
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:07,322
waits for his opening.

346
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,788
-Of course, he'll
never tangle the rope.

347
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:14,588
-And I guess that's
why Kikumaru is

348
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:17,422
able to attack so
aggressively, right?

349
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:19,388
-Yeah.

350
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:20,555
-No wonder.

351
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:22,522
The golden pair.

352
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:23,588
They can't lose.

353
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:24,555
-Go for it!

354
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:26,855
Never mind the blur shot.

355
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:27,588
-Golden pair!

356
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:38,555
-That's sweet.

357
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:39,955
Kikumaru rocks.

358
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,955
-Kill the ball, Kikumaru!

359
00:18:46,955 --> 00:18:47,388
-Awesome!

360
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:55,555
-Now's my chance.

361
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:56,888
-Kikamaru.

362
00:18:56,922 --> 00:18:57,522
You're through!

363
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:02,355
-I don't think so.

364
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:03,222
-Huh?

365
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:05,388
It's Oishi!

366
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:06,722
-Oishi?

367
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:10,888
Too bad, Akazawa,
'cause this is doubles.

368
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:11,522
-Here it goes.

369
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:14,288
Oishi's best shot.

370
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:15,555
Absolutely control.

371
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:18,288
He'll aim his shot right
over his opponent, a top spin

372
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:18,788
volley.

373
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:24,722
-Huh?

374
00:19:28,222 --> 00:19:33,522
-Oh no, the-- the moon
volley, heading near the line.

375
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:36,122
No way.

376
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:37,255
-That's not right.

377
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:40,055
Oishi didn't aim near the line.

378
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:40,955
-What?

379
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:44,355
-He aimed right at the line.

380
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:45,755
-Amazing.

381
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:47,688
They're even more golden now.

382
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:50,188
-I thought it was over for sure.

383
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,655
-Oishi is just smoking hot.

384
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:57,122
-Oishi.

385
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:05,988
-They're good.

386
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:09,022
It's no surprise to me that
they made it to the nationals.

387
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:09,988
Impressive.

388
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:11,022
-Yeah.

389
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:14,788
Only Oishi could do
a move like that.

390
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:16,388
-It's still early in the game.

391
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,856
[theme music]

392
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,046
KIKAMARU: Yahoo!

393
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,913
It's Kikamaru.

394
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:02,146
The St. Rudolph
match is a killer.

395
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,680
Why do they only focus on me?

396
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:06,913
This is bad.

397
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:09,580
But we've been working
on a new trick.

398
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:10,713
Right, Oishi?

399
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:14,380
Next on "The Prince of
Tennis," Mortal Blow,

400
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:16,780
Eiji's Famed Sleep Attack.

401
00:21:16,813 --> 00:21:18,380
I'm not sleeping.

402
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:20,346
I'm not.
