1
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:07,816
-Right.

2
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:08,816
Here's the plan.

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:10,783
We go with our Two
Guardian strategy.

4
00:00:10,816 --> 00:00:11,616
-Let's do it, Momo.

5
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:18,016
[theme music]

6
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:35,847
-Hey, Sis.

7
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,180
How do you want your eggs?

8
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:39,913
YUMIKO: Um, how
about sunny side up?

9
00:01:39,947 --> 00:01:40,547
-All right.

10
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,213
Huh?

11
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:47,980
Sweet.

12
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:48,580
Two yolks.

13
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,080
[racket hits ball]

14
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,613
[another ball sent]

15
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:10,147
TAKASHI: Well, I guess I'm off.

16
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,380
-Hey, Takashi.

17
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:13,080
Good luck on your match today.

18
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:15,313
-Yeah, I hope they
don't put me on reserve.

19
00:02:15,347 --> 00:02:16,247
-Don't say that.

20
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,880
I got some nice
fish here, so I'll

21
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:19,513
make special sushi for you.

22
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:21,413
Just remember to do your best.

23
00:02:21,447 --> 00:02:22,347
-Aw!

24
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,347
Don't put too much
pressure on me.

25
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:31,247
-[laughs]

26
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,713
[car horn beeps repeatedly]

27
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:39,280
-Shusuke.

28
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:40,947
Want to ride in my car?

29
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,913
-Thanks, Sis.

30
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:43,747
That's nice.

31
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:57,480
-[humming]

32
00:02:57,513 --> 00:02:58,547
RINKO: Ryoma?

33
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,547
Are you doing OK with the time?

34
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,047
-But mom, we're the
number one seed,

35
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,347
so we don't have to be
there for another hour.

36
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,613
And Momo's coming
over to pick me up.

37
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,780
Hm.

38
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:12,347
I see we're not having
Japanese food again today.

39
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,747
RINKO: That's right. [laughs]

40
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,247
-You know how Aunty
likes her Western food.

41
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,347
NANJIRO: So tell me, you're
a regular already, huh?

42
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,213
What do you know about that?

43
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,947
-Hm.

44
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,113
Not sure really.

45
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:30,847
-Hey, Echizen.

46
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,747
I'm here!

47
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,247
RYOMA: Hm?

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,413
I'm leaving.

49
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:41,980
-[scoffs] I'm not sure really?

50
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:42,913
What's up with that?

51
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:51,780
BUS ANNOUNCEMENT: This bus
is bound for the Shiki Sports

52
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:52,247
Park.

53
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:03,080
-Time for the big
show, eh, Tezuka?

54
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,347
SAORI: -The district matches
are finally starting Mr. Inoue.

55
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,113
-Ah, they sure are.

56
00:04:12,147 --> 00:04:15,180
Players who win here will go
on to the Metro Tournament,

57
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,280
then on to Kanto.

58
00:04:16,313 --> 00:04:17,947
That's where the
regionals are held.

59
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,913
Finally, they'll get a
ticket to the Nationals.

60
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:23,080
SAORI: Oh, this is so exciting.

61
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:25,513
With dreams of making it
to the Nationals, which

62
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:28,680
are held just once a year,
players from each school

63
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:31,613
gather here in hopes
of winning. [laughs]

64
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,780
-This is the place to be
to check out all the up

65
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:35,213
and coming players
who are going to make

66
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:36,880
this tournament a
fascinating spectacle.

67
00:04:36,913 --> 00:04:39,413
SAORI: I'll tell you
what's fascinating to me.

68
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,113
Watching Ryoma play and win!

69
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,980
He's just so cute, huh?

70
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:45,580
-Stop that sniveling and listen.

71
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:46,380
SAKUNO: Huh?

72
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:48,247
What do mean, you can't go?

73
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,180
-My parents went out and
left me all alone here

74
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:51,747
to look after my
little brothers.

75
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,513
Sakuno, please go and
watch Ryoma's match

76
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:56,713
and cheer him on for me.

77
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:57,213
Ai!

78
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:57,913
Oy!

79
00:04:57,947 --> 00:04:59,080
(OVER PHONE) Stop that!

80
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:00,347
Leave my pigtail alone.

81
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,780
Stop!

82
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:02,747
-But Tomoka--

83
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,680
[phone hangs up]

84
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:06,080
[busy signal]

85
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:06,913
Oh.

86
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:07,947
[interposing voices of crowd]

87
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,913
MALE: Oh my gosh!

88
00:05:08,947 --> 00:05:10,347
They were great.

89
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,280
MALE: I feel so wrong.

90
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:12,113
I'm going to just sit down.

91
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:12,588
MALE: Hoorah!

92
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:13,062
We won!

93
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:13,862
We won!

94
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:14,562
MALE: Did you see that shot?

95
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:15,262
MALE: They were great!

96
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:16,362
MALE: They are so good.

97
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:17,029
-Hm?

98
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:18,495
-Hey, here they come.

99
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:19,462
-Hm?

100
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:20,162
MALE: Wow!

101
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,162
It's really them.

102
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:32,929
-I'd like to register
eight players.

103
00:05:32,962 --> 00:05:35,895
They're the regulars
from the Seishun Academy.

104
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:36,829
-They're from Seigaku.

105
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:39,329
-Hey, Tezuka?

106
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:41,395
I'm rooting for you!

107
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:42,295
[laughs]

108
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:43,162
-Seigaku, huh?

109
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:46,629
They look tough to beat.

110
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:47,462
-Hey!

111
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:49,362
What's with that pint-sized kid?

112
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:53,095
-Looks like a
seventh-grader to me.

113
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,195
A seventh-grader?

114
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,429
Man, that Seigaku team
must be really deep.

115
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:57,829
-Hey, Fukawa, look.

116
00:05:57,862 --> 00:05:59,162
It's those two.

117
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:01,229
-I see them.

118
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:02,395
No mistake.

119
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,495
They're the guys we played
a couple nights ago.

120
00:06:07,395 --> 00:06:09,662
Those two were
Seigaku Regulars, huh?

121
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:11,562
-That's the school we play next.

122
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:13,062
Looks like we could
be in trouble.

123
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:21,029
-My guess is, it'll come down
so Seigaku versus Kakunoki again

124
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:22,195
in the finals.

125
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:23,195
-Probably.

126
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,062
They both got a
number of tough guys,

127
00:06:25,095 --> 00:06:28,995
and with that many good players,
no one else stands a chance.

128
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:31,295
-You really think so?

129
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:32,829
Oh!

130
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:34,295
-Uh, uh.

131
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:35,762
Uh.

132
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,762
Uh, ah.

133
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:43,195
-Oh?

134
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:44,662
Oh!

135
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,662
[gulping drink]

136
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:49,595
-Uh, ah.

137
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:50,095
-Hey!

138
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:51,229
Oh?

139
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:53,329
-From your uniform, I'd
say you're from Seigaku.

140
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:55,129
-Uh, yes.

141
00:06:55,162 --> 00:06:57,095
-The Seigaku matches
are over there.

142
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:58,162
I can take you.

143
00:06:58,195 --> 00:06:58,829
-Oh!

144
00:06:58,862 --> 00:06:59,629
Thank you very much.

145
00:06:59,662 --> 00:07:00,462
Uh!

146
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:01,762
[running footsteps recede]

147
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:06,062
-No problem at all-- Wonder
why she's in such a rush?

148
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:06,829
Oh, well.

149
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:08,629
[gulping drink]

150
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,662
-Aw, the district matches.

151
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:12,395
I'm so nervous!

152
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:13,729
-Why are you so nervous?

153
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:15,795
It's not like you're going
to be out there playing

154
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:17,629
against the tough competition.

155
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:18,762
-I know that.

156
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:20,729
But I'm all caught up in
this tense atmosphere,

157
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:22,529
and it's just so exciting!

158
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:23,529
-I know what you mean.

159
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:24,929
It's the waiting that gets me.

160
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:26,562
The other matches
have already started,

161
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:28,495
but Seigaku won't
get here 'till later,

162
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:29,895
'cause they're
seeded number one.

163
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:32,029
-Doesn't seem like
a big waste to you?

164
00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:34,195
I mean, they could come
early to study the players

165
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:35,862
on the other teams
they'll have to face.

166
00:07:35,895 --> 00:07:36,495
-No.

167
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:37,462
We don't need to.

168
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:39,662
Seigaku is in a
class all by itself.

169
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:41,762
-Seventh-graders,
don't wander around.

170
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,862
You'll get lost.

171
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,362
-The Seigaku matches
are going to start soon.

172
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:45,895
Time together at the court.

173
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:48,095
-(TOGETHER) Yeah!

174
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,595
-By the way, do you
know who's going

175
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:52,295
to be playing in the Number
Three Singles Match today?

176
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:53,495
-No idea.

177
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:56,029
But I know number one will
be Team Captain Tezuka.

178
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:58,062
And number two will be Fuji.

179
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:00,329
And maybe the
third will be Momo.

180
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:01,729
-Sounds right.

181
00:08:01,762 --> 00:08:04,295
But there's no way they would
Echizen play the Number Three

182
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:08,062
Singles Match In a
tournament like this one.

183
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:10,729
-This is the line-up that was
turned in to Registration.

184
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:11,995
-What?

185
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:14,395
Captain Tezuka's not going
to play against Gyokurin?

186
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:16,962
-He's sitting out?

187
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:17,995
Mm.

188
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:20,695
Echizen and Momoshiro
are in doubles?

189
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:22,062
-That's what they asked for.

190
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:24,595
Coach Ryuzaki was still
undecided until just

191
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,062
before we registered.

192
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:27,029
-I don't get it.

193
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:27,762
What's going on?

194
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:32,270
-Eiji?

195
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,370
-Huh?

196
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:35,970
-Here.

197
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:38,770
-Hey, thanks!

198
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:40,436
-It's not hard to
figure out why they're

199
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,703
called the "Golden Pair".

200
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:43,703
They're totally in synch.

201
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:44,903
Hey, Echizen.

202
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:45,803
Get that, will you?

203
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:47,336
-What are you talking about?

204
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,570
-What else?

205
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:50,470
I'm talking about the towel
you're sitting around.

206
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:51,403
-Huh?

207
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:52,970
-(TOGETHER) They
are not in synch!

208
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,870
PA ANNOUNCER: For the
Number One Singles Match,

209
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:01,736
Fuji of Seigaku versus
Suzuki of Gyokurin.

210
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,903
This will be a best of
five match team play,

211
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:06,236
and whichever team wins
three matches will advance.

212
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,170
Since this is
Seigaku's first round,

213
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:10,370
even if the winner is
decided, all five matches

214
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:11,336
will be played.

215
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,536
Each match will be one set only.

216
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,336
-That weird pair
is playing doubles.

217
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,403
Looks like it's going to
be an easy win for us.

218
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:20,470
-Bad move by Seigaku.

219
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:24,036
-(TOGETHER) We'll upset
Seigaku, the number seed.

220
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,203
-Well, now.

221
00:09:25,236 --> 00:09:27,270
Let's see what'll happen.

222
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:29,603
Now, Tezuka, good
don't be upset with me.

223
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,936
There's no reason
for you to overdo it.

224
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:32,436
-Yes.

225
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,736
I know.

226
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,736
PA ANNOUNCER: Announcing the
Number One Doubles Match.

227
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,803
For Seigaku,
Momoshiro and Echizen.

228
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:43,036
For Gyokurin, Izumi and Fukawa.

229
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,703
-They're really going
to play after they

230
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:46,336
lost so badly the other day?

231
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,270
That's pretty gutsy.

232
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:49,703
[running footsteps approach]

233
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:51,336
-(BREATHLESSLY) I
made it in time!

234
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,103
-Huh?

235
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:53,203
Eh, hey!

236
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:55,336
Didn't you start heading
over here before me?

237
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,403
-Huh?

238
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:58,736
Yes, but I got lost.

239
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,470
What's this?

240
00:09:59,503 --> 00:10:00,970
Doubles match?

241
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:04,170
-This is going to
be very interesting.

242
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,103
-I didn't realize you two belong
to the illustrious Seigaku.

243
00:10:07,136 --> 00:10:08,936
It comes as a shock to me.

244
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,770
-That's for sure.

245
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:11,136
We must be very lucky.

246
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:11,836
-Yeah.

247
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,670
What a big break for us.

248
00:10:13,703 --> 00:10:17,003
If this were singles, no doubt
you'd have the advantage.

249
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:18,603
-Probably.

250
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:21,203
[both grunt in anger]

251
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:24,070
-On the other hand, it
usually proves a lot more fun

252
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:27,970
to be able to beat your
opponents at their own game.

253
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,203
-Is that why--

254
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:31,336
---you've teamed up against us?

255
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,770
-I'm so very relieved.

256
00:10:32,803 --> 00:10:35,503
This has worked out
just like we planned.

257
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:37,170
-They're psyching
each other out.

258
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,136
-Yeah, I get it.

259
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,636
That must be the
reason why they're--

260
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,470
-What?

261
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:42,703
Ryoma's going to play doubles?

262
00:10:42,736 --> 00:10:45,503
-If you think you can master
doubles in a few days,

263
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:46,836
you've got another thing coming.

264
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,136
And we're going to show
you how wrong you are.

265
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,636
-I wonder.

266
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,036
You know we're geniuses
when it comes to learning.

267
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:55,670
Right.

268
00:10:55,703 --> 00:10:56,670
Here's the plan.

269
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:58,636
We go with our Two
Guardian strategy.

270
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,670
-Let's do it, Momo.

271
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:05,536
-Huh?

272
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,503
Two Guardians?

273
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:08,836
-Any clue what that is?

274
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,103
-Not a one.

275
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,003
-Looks like they came up
with a secret plan of attack.

276
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:13,303
-Oh, Ryoma!

277
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:15,370
-If nothing else,
this doubles match

278
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:18,103
will mark the first step towards
competing in the National

279
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,303
Tournament.

280
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:20,836
-Look, how much
practicing could they

281
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,370
have done in one or two days?

282
00:11:23,403 --> 00:11:25,170
They must be bluffing.

283
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:25,670
IZUMI: Hm!

284
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:30,136
PA ANNOUNCER: One set match.

285
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,770
Gyokurin's Izumi to serve.

287
00:11:49,465 --> 00:11:52,432
[seigaku students cheering]

288
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:55,898
MALE: Whoo!

289
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:03,398
-I'm going to make you
regret ever showing up.

290
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,065
-Echizen?

291
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:04,998
Don't mess up.

292
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:05,498
-Hey!

293
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:06,432
You, too!

294
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:08,298
-Uh!

295
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:09,432
-Unh!

296
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:11,398
-This is going to be the
most humiliating defeat

297
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:12,265
of your lives.

298
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,098
Take that!

299
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:16,765
-It's going to go
right in-between them.

300
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:17,265
-Ah!

301
00:12:17,298 --> 00:12:17,765
-Oh!

302
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:23,298
-(DISBELIEVING)
They returned it!

303
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:24,098
-No way!

304
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:25,432
The other night, they--

305
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:26,898
PA ANNOUNCER: Love, 15.

306
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:27,798
-(TOGETHER) Yeah!

307
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:28,498
-All right, team!

308
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:29,598
-Go Seigaku!

309
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:31,998
-Ryoma and Momo are
doing great together.

310
00:12:32,032 --> 00:12:33,498
-Momo's yell sure was weird.

311
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:34,165
-All right.

312
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:35,098
Go team!

313
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:36,465
Keep making points
and you'll win!

314
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:37,832
-I'm not surprised.

315
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:40,898
I knew Ryoma and Momo sure
could pull it of with no sweat.

316
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:41,398
-Ohh!

317
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:43,132
-You can do it!

318
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:44,465
-Huh.

319
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,898
Maybe Ryoma really is a terrific
doubles player after all.

320
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:50,698
-This is one match you
can't take your eyes off of.

321
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,665
-That's the ticket.

322
00:12:58,565 --> 00:12:59,165
Look!

323
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:00,465
I'm right.

324
00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:02,398
What'd I tell you?

325
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:04,765
It says right here,
in basic doubles play,

326
00:13:04,798 --> 00:13:06,398
a ball hit down
the middle should

327
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,632
be taken by the forehand player.

328
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:09,698
See?

329
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:11,032
-Hm.

330
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:13,265
But what if the back-hand
player wants to take it, too?

331
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:13,798
-Well, sure.

332
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:14,898
Why not?

333
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,798
But then it wouldn't be
doubles, now would it?

334
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:18,998
-Hm.

335
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,532
Then it might be better
if I played right-handed.

336
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:23,132
Hey, if you're
just running around

337
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:25,065
on your side of the
court and you see a ball,

338
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:27,632
don't you feel the need to go
after it and try to hit it?

339
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:28,832
-Hey!

340
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:30,765
Did you ever consider
the fact I'm your senior?

341
00:13:30,798 --> 00:13:32,465
Maybe we should think
up some signals,

342
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:35,465
like calling out
OK or something.

343
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:37,198
Well, how about
some voice signals?

344
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:38,032
Hm.

345
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:38,598
Let's see.

346
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:40,465
What would work?

347
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:41,998
Hm.

348
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:42,832
Yeah!

349
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,065
We'll go with those.

350
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:47,432
The Two Guardians will say, Ah!

351
00:13:47,465 --> 00:13:47,932
Ooh!

352
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:51,632
SAKUNO: They did it!

353
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:52,598
PA ANNOUNCER: Love, 30.

354
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:53,365
SAKUNO: All right!

355
00:13:57,365 --> 00:13:58,265
Oh my!

356
00:13:58,298 --> 00:13:59,165
They're terrific!

357
00:13:59,198 --> 00:13:59,865
-Oh!

358
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:00,998
-Way to go, boys!

359
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:03,498
They're in perfect
harmony as a doubles team.

360
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:05,098
-Hm. (LAUGHING) I don't know.

361
00:14:05,132 --> 00:14:08,098
They may be working perfectly
together, but-- [laughs].

362
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:12,098
-But those signals they're
using are a little embarrassing.

363
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:12,598
-Yeah.

364
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:13,698
Sure are.

365
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:15,332
-We've got the secret
to playing doubles.

366
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:16,698
I'm so smart.

367
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,765
-I hit the shot, you know?

368
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:21,332
-Playing together, they've
managed to close up the middle.

369
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:23,865
And they're doing it with
those weird grunting noises.

370
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:24,932
-Don't let it get to you.

371
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:25,965
Keep pressuring them.

372
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:26,665
They'll collapse.

373
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:29,198
Just watch.

374
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:29,698
Unh!

375
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:30,698
-Unh!

376
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:32,332
-(THINKING) Then
let's try going deep.

377
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:33,832
Unh!

378
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:35,165
-Whoa!

379
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:36,132
-Got it.

380
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:37,098
Unh!

381
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:38,032
-Much obliged.

382
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:39,232
-No problem.

383
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:41,398
-(THINKING) Huh, two of
have lined up perfectly,

384
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:43,865
just as Izumi said.

385
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:47,832
All they've learned to
do is close the middle.

386
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:50,132
And they've left half
the court wide open.

387
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:54,265
Hyah!

388
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:54,898
-(TOGETHER) Oh!

389
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:05,232
PA ANNOUNCER: 15, 30.

390
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:11,732
-That's not good.

391
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:14,165
-They don't have a clue what
to do, other than close up

392
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:14,698
the middle.

393
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:15,632
-[snickers]

394
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,232
-They were almost
able to get it.

395
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:20,032
And I hit that ball in
the wide open court.

396
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:22,398
Those guys are super
fast in a sprint.

397
00:15:22,432 --> 00:15:23,898
And if only we were
playing singles,

398
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:24,965
they might be able to--

399
00:15:24,998 --> 00:15:25,765
-Fukawa!

400
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:27,065
This isn't a singles match.

401
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:29,465
It's a doubles match.

402
00:15:29,498 --> 00:15:32,365
We've just got to stick
together and we can beat them.

403
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,498
-Oh, I got a bad feeling!

404
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:35,132
-Me, too.

405
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,098
-Unh!

406
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:43,832
-Look!

407
00:15:43,865 --> 00:15:44,665
He fluffed the serve.

408
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:45,565
-I'll say he did.

409
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:46,532
-Now's your big chance!

410
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:47,632
Put it away!

411
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:48,732
-That was deliberate.

412
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:50,165
-Hm!

413
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:53,832
IZUMI: It's not just the
strongest who win in doubles.

414
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:54,332
-Oh!

415
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:58,660
-Wow, a double poach!

416
00:15:58,694 --> 00:16:00,294
-With both of them
at the net, there's

417
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,560
no place left for
them to hit the ball!

418
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,394
-Umh!

419
00:16:05,427 --> 00:16:07,760
-Un-anh!

00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:08,660
PA ANNOUNCER: 30 all!

421
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:14,460
-In doubles, working together
is the key to winning a game.

422
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:14,994
-Come on.

423
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:16,094
Let's do it.

424
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,994
-They've evened up the score!

425
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:19,827
-Against Seigaku?

00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:30,494
Yeah!

435
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:31,027
Good job!

00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,627
-Oh, well.

438
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,927
It's just like I thought
it was going to be.

439
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,227
-I guess so.

440
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,160
-Seems like they're trying
every trick in the book on us.

441
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:42,460
Even that f serve had a purpose.

442
00:16:42,494 --> 00:16:42,960
-Hmm.

443
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:47,827

Hu-unh!

452
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,127

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,794

Game to Gyokurin.

456

They lead one game to love.

457
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:25,494
-This is almost too easy.

458
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:26,727

-Those two sure don't
look to happy with the way

461
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,394
things are going.

462
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:36,627
Gyokurin might actually
win this one. [scoffs]

463
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,527
-Mm.

00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,527

00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:40,394
Oh, Miss Shiba.

467
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,027
-Who was that girl
you were with?

468
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,327
Is she a friend of yours?

469
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,694
-Huh?

470
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:47,060
Oh, I don't know her.

471
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:49,160
-Sure you don't know her.

00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:49,660
-Oh!

473
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:56,527
I remember her now.

474
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,694
-Oh, what's the matter?

475
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,127
-They're behind already.

476
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,694
-Looks like Gyokurin
has control of the game.

477
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:03,160
INUI: And it's no wonder.

478
00:18:03,194 --> 00:18:03,794
-Inui?

479
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:05,194
What do you mean?

480
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:07,960
-If Momoshiro and Echizen play
that far out of position, then

481
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:10,527
no matter how good they are
as athletes, getting a point

482
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,827
will prove challenging.

483
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,727
SATOSHI: Well, but-- Is the
formation for doubles really

484
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,460
that much different
than singles?

485
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:18,927
-Hu-unh!

486
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,860
INUI (VOICEOVER): That's the
most basic position in doubles.

487
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:26,427
However, once that basic
formation is changed,

488
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,494
Momo and Echizen, who have
never teamed up before--

489
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:30,494
-Unh!

490
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,927
INUI (VOICEOVER):
--end up leaving

491
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,660
half the court wide open.

492
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:34,927
-(ALL) Oh!

493
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,627
-Basically, the player who
can get to the ball first

494
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,094
should be the one to hit it,
while the other player should

495
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:42,894
switch positions to cover him
In the case of Echizen and Momo,

496
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:45,660
the areas they try to
cover are way too large.

497
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:46,994
So they both end up--

498
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:47,494
-Hu-unh!

499
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,527
INUI (VOICEOVER):
--running after every ball,

500
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,094
and ultimately--

501
00:18:53,127 --> 00:18:54,527
-Hmph!

502
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,060
INUI (VOICEOVER): --leaving
big holes on the court.

-Uh, Momo, I think
you took a ball that

506
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,794
should have been mine.

507
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:07,894
-No.

508
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:09,694
The player in front
takes any ball he can.

509
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:12,394
-If you can't put it away,
you shouldn't try to hit it.

510
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:13,127
-What's that?

511
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,927
You've got a complaint?

512
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,760

-Oh, no.

515
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:19,660
They're arguing with each other.

516
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:21,394
-This isn't going well.

517
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,360
-Inui, is there any
chance that Ryoma and Momo

518
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:24,760
can turn the master
match around?

519
00:19:24,794 --> 00:19:26,960
-Against a polished team
like Izumi and Fukawa,

520
00:19:26,994 --> 00:19:29,227
only a coordinated
team can triumph.

521
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,227
So unfortunately, right
now, I'd say, not a chance.

522
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,494
-That pair from Gyokurin,
they're pretty good.

523
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:39,060
-Yeah, but our makeshift
team is having big problems.

524
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,694
-Yeah.

525
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:42,027
You got that right.

526
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,694
-This is really terrible.

00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:44,627

528
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,894
-Don't worry so much.

529
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:47,827
This is Echizen
we're talking about.

530
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,660
I'm sure he's got some amazing
trick up his sleeve that'll

531
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:52,294
turn this match around for them.

00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:03,843
So far, the Two
Guardian strategy

548
00:21:03,877 --> 00:21:07,077
isn't working too well,
and the teamwork is shoddy.

549
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,043
At this rate, they'll
lose to Gyokurin.

550
00:21:10,077 --> 00:21:11,843
Hey, what are you doing Ryoma?

551
00:21:11,877 --> 00:21:12,810
And Momo.

552
00:21:12,843 --> 00:21:13,310
too!

553
00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:19,410
Next episode, "Real
Men Play Doubles".

554
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:22,110
Those two really are amazing!
