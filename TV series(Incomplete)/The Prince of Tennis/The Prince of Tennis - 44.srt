1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,646
-Are those cramps?

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,046
-Now they know.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,013
-No way.

4
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:17,413
A cramp in Momo's leg?

5
00:00:17,446 --> 00:00:18,346
-Oh, no.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,280
-It looks bad.

7
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,846
I doubt he can play a
decent match like that.

8
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:31,546
-What a devastating return!

9
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:36,380
-I admire your
determination, Momoshiro.

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,846
[theme music]

11
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:55,681
[shout]

12
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:56,681
-All right, then.

13
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,681
Come and get me, Momoshiro.

14
00:01:58,715 --> 00:01:59,181
Huh?

15
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:10,115
-I am--

16
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:13,115
-It can't be!

17
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:14,615
-I am tough!

18
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:29,015
-He jumps with his forward
leg, which bears his weight,

19
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,281
then drives the ball
as hard as he can.

20
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:34,515
And that advanced backhand
technique, the Jackknife.

21
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:37,181
No junior high schooler should
be able to hit that shot.

22
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:39,048
-What an incredibly fast ball!

23
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:40,081
-Yeah, I know.

24
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:41,648
No matter how good
his eagle eyes are,

25
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:44,315
he couldn't have seen that shot.

26
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:45,248
-No.

27
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:48,548
I can see it.

28
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:49,881
Yup.

29
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:51,048
There it is.

30
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:52,648
Even with cramps
in one leg, he's

31
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:54,115
still able to hit that shot.

32
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:55,315
All right, then.

33
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:58,248
I'll be hitting with all
my might, too, Momoshiro.

34
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:11,248
-It knocked the racket
right out of his hand!

35
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:12,681
-That was heavy.

36
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:16,915
It felt like I was
hitting a bowling ball.

37
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,581
-To think there's a
junior high school

38
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,848
student who can hit that.

39
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:22,481
-That was a Jackknife.

40
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:24,248
-Jackknife?

41
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:25,815
-That Momoshiro.

42
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:29,881
He is awfully
strong and powerful.

43
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:31,415
-So it's finally come to this.

44
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:37,915
-The Jackknife uses the
body's center of gravity

45
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:40,815
as an axis for a
pendulum-like motion.

46
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:44,248
Then as weight is
placed on the front leg,

47
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:47,881
momentum from the jump
powers a strong drive.

48
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:50,948
What's more, by
maintaining contact

49
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,781
with the ball on
the follow through,

50
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:57,715
Momo was able to drive the
ball with a heavy spin.

51
00:03:57,748 --> 00:03:59,948
-And he's been hiding
that super stroke.

52
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:01,148
Right on.

53
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:04,315
-He sure is something.

54
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:05,281
-Aw.

55
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:06,248
Momo's amazing.

56
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:09,648
Doing that with a cramping leg.

57
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:13,915
-Momoshiro, you're so cool!

58
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:15,648
-So that's his shot.

59
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:18,681
The homemade Jackknife.

60
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:21,281
-It seems you perfected that
one on the fly, Momoshiro.

61
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:28,115
-He's pretty good
for a schoolboy.

62
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:32,048
[cheering]

63
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,415
-That's it?

64
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:43,881
-Jackknife!

65
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:52,981
-All right!

66
00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:54,248
Go get 'em, Momoshiro.

67
00:04:57,748 --> 00:04:58,715
-Get him, man!

68
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,381
SENGOKU (VOICEOVER):
I thought he

69
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:06,681
was having cramps
in his left leg.

70
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:07,881
Is he invincible?

71
00:05:07,915 --> 00:05:09,915
If I don't nail him
with this serve,

72
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:12,981
I'm going to be in trouble.

73
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:13,981
WOMAN: There it is!

74
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:17,448
The Tiger Cannon!

75
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:18,948
-You're underestimating me!

76
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:27,615
Oh.

77
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:28,981
I guess it went over.

78
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,881
Lucky me.

79
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,781
-That guy's amazing.

80
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,981
-He's beating Sengoku
at his own game.

81
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:44,515
-He did it!

82
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:46,348
-It looks like Momo's
luck has turned.

83
00:05:53,915 --> 00:05:58,448
-But that cramp in his leg must
be hurting very badly by now.

84
00:05:58,481 --> 00:06:00,281
I wonder if he's OK?

85
00:06:00,315 --> 00:06:01,581
-Don't worry.

86
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:04,048
If it gets really bad, the
old hag will stop the much.

87
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:08,781
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER):
He's almost at his limit.

88
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:37,681
-Here it is, here it is.

89
00:06:37,715 --> 00:06:40,015
It's finally match point.

90
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:42,748
-Go for the win, Momo!

91
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:44,315
-Go for it!

92
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:46,715
SENGOKU (VOICEOVER): My pride
as a junior all-star player

93
00:06:46,748 --> 00:06:48,815
won't let you
defeat me so easily.

94
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,148
-Tiger Cannon.

95
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,215
-What?

96
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:58,248
How can he still be
hitting that serve?

97
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:04,648
-Hang in there, leg!

98
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:10,748
-He jumped!

99
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:15,415
-Will he return the Tiger
Cannon with a Jackknife?

100
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:17,915
[shout]

101
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,881
-I can return that shot.

102
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:34,915
-A two handed forehand?

103
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:49,181
-Huh?

104
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:07,348
-Momo!

105
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:11,248
[heavy breathing]

106
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:24,081
[laughter]

107
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:30,481
[cheering]

108
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:31,948
-He did it!

109
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:35,415
-All right, Momo!

110
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,381
Hm.

111
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:39,348
-He somehow managed to win.

112
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:41,581
-He sure had us on
pins and needles.

113
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:53,715
SENGOKU (VOICEOVER): I've
never seen anyone like that.

114
00:08:53,748 --> 00:09:00,481
Even with cramps in one leg,
he just kept getting stronger.

115
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:02,815
Hm.

116
00:09:02,848 --> 00:09:04,181
ANNOUNCER: Game and match.

117
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:08,381
Seigaku's Momoshiro,
seven games to five.

118
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,615
-Now Seigaku has two wins.

119
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:15,381
One more victory, and they'll
win the metropolitan matches.

120
00:09:15,415 --> 00:09:16,881
And the next match up is--

121
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:29,481
-Looks like I lost.

122
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:30,848
Sorry.

123
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:33,615
-Facing off to and prior
to the Kanto matches

124
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:36,015
was indeed a lucky
break for you.

125
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:36,648
-Yep.

126
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:38,681
He sure is strong.

127
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:41,215
BOY: Hey Momo, are you
sure you're all right?

128
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,248
-Hm?

129
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,581
-Yeah, I'm fine.

130
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,981
Thanks for cheering me on, guys.

131
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:48,881
-Lucky Sengoku.

132
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:52,581
You most certainly are
our school's ace player.

133
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:57,848
However, the opponent was
merely an underclassman.

134
00:09:57,881 --> 00:10:00,815
And with a leg cramp, to boot.

135
00:10:00,848 --> 00:10:02,215
So what do you say to that?

136
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:03,015
Hm?

137
00:10:03,048 --> 00:10:04,615
-I said I was sorry, Banji.

138
00:10:04,648 --> 00:10:06,781
I meant it.

139
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,848
[groaning]

140
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:10,981
-My goodness.

141
00:10:11,015 --> 00:10:13,215
How were you able to
move in this condition?

142
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:15,415
-You're totally amazing, Momo!

143
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,448
-That when an important win.

144
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:19,881
-OK, we're at two
wins, one loss.

145
00:10:19,915 --> 00:10:21,415
One more win, and--

146
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:22,615
-We'll sweep the metropolitan.

147
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:26,748
I see.

148
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:28,481
Once again, you're
getting the good part.

149
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:39,883
ANNOUNCER: We will be
conducting court maintenance.

150
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,750
The match will
recommence shortly.

151
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:45,650
-Oh, boy.

152
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:47,250
Just when we were
getting into it, too.

153
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,283
-I wonder what Ryoma's next
opponent, Akutsu, is like?

154
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:55,083
-Are you worried?

155
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:55,550
-Huh?

156
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,383
Oh!

157
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:57,883
Miss Shiba!

158
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,350
-He'll be just fine.

159
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:00,850
Ryoma can handle it.

160
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:07,217
-Echizen's opponent is
that Akutsu fellow, yes?

161
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,217
-Kachiro, isn't he that
dangerous psychopathic guy?

162
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,650
-Yeah.

163
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:16,850
-You're a member of
the tennis team, right?

164
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,150
There's a seventh grade
regular whose name

165
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,050
is something like Echigoya.

166
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,783
Isn't that right?

167
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,017
Bring over Echigoya.

168
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,483
maybe I'll hit your
face with my next shot.

169
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,583
-Ryoma!

170
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:48,183
Please, be careful out there.

171
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:50,817
-Well, if anything happens,
we'll come to your rescue

172
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,950
for sure.

173
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,783
-I've always wanted to
participate in a rumble.

174
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:56,617
-Kikumaru.

175
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,217
-Hey, I was just joking.

176
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:04,017
-Ryoma, where are you going?

177
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,983
-I'm just a little bit
thirsty, that's all.

178
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,983
-Well, if that's the case,
I've got some Inui recovery

179
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:13,283
type special golden power
remix elixir right here waiting

180
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,617
for you.

181
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,650
-Um, no thanks.

182
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,983
Don't rush the net?

183
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:23,017
-Yeah.

184
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,417
If you get too close
to him, who knows

185
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,583
what he's capable of doing?

186
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,683
-He's a real dirty player.

187
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,117
And he'll come
after you viciously.

188
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,150
-Kawamara.

189
00:12:49,183 --> 00:12:51,917
So how many years
did to take karate?

190
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,717
-Huh?

191
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,617
-Oh, about six years.

192
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,117
-Hm.

193
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:01,350
-Ehchizn?

194
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:02,350
-Hey, wait up.

195
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:03,850
Hey, wait a minute!

196
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,504
Hey!

197
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:09,683
-Aren't you even going
to say hello to your son?

198
00:13:09,717 --> 00:13:10,783
-Naw.

199
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:14,250
Neither one of us into
that kind of stuff.

200
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:17,317
-Does Ryoma know that
it was Coach Banda who,

201
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,217
many years ago, gave
you the one and only

202
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,217
loss of your high
school tennis career,

203
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,350
even though the loss really
was for the whole team?

204
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:27,717
-Look, I dunno.

205
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,283
Maybe he's heard it
from someone else.

206
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:33,283
-Boy, clouds sure
are high today.

207
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:34,250
-Huh?

208
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:35,750
-The clouds sure are high.

209
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:42,150
-The Jackknife!

210
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:43,150
Victory!

211
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:46,083
-You're good!

212
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:46,583
-Huh?

213
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,517
-Huh?

214
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,450
Hey, it's Ryoma!

215
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:50,950
Hi, Ryoma!

216
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:52,383
Do your best!

217
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:55,317
If you win, you'll win
the metropolitan matches.

218
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,450
-And if you do that, I'll
put a huge picture of you

219
00:13:57,483 --> 00:14:00,083
in next month's edition.

220
00:14:00,117 --> 00:14:02,017
-As president for life
of the Ryoma fan club,

221
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,383
I'll do my utmost
to cheer you on.

222
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,383
-Ah--

223
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:08,817
-Ryoma.

224
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,350
Um, be careful.

225
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:19,750
-Seriously, listen
up up, all of you.

226
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:21,550
You've still got a ways to go.

227
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:25,950
-All right!

228
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:27,417
Go, go!

229
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,417
Ryoma, go!

230
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,350
Hip, hip, hooray!

231
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:34,683
Hip, hip, hooray!

232
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:35,817
SAKUNO (VOICEOVER): Ryoma.

233
00:14:45,617 --> 00:14:49,083
-Echizen, please don't forget
about what I told you earlier.

234
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:55,017
-Just do your best, Echizen.

235
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,483
-Don't forget, I'll be
looking forward to a rumble.

236
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:01,817
-And dude, take it easy, and
try not to hurt yourself.

237
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,350
-Even if you lose,
Tezuka has got

238
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:04,717
you covered on the next one.

239
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,383
Try to have a little fun.

240
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:06,883
-Right.

241
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,517
-Have a little fun,
even if he loses?

242
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,750
He's not the type to be
taking that kind of advice.

243
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:22,083
-I know.

244
00:15:22,117 --> 00:15:22,583
-Ryoma.

245
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:30,117
BOY: Yikes!

246
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,383
There he is!

247
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:32,417
It's Akutsu!

248
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:40,483
-Akautsu, come forward.

249
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:41,483
-Come on, Akutsu.

250
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:43,183
You have to hurry!

251
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:47,950
-Don't sweat it--
But, but-- Akutsu!

252
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:49,050
-Hey, old man.

253
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,517
All I have to do
is win this match,

254
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,283
and it's all over, right?

255
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:54,050
-Yes.

256
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,417
'Cause you know what?

257
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,983
Tennis doesn't
really do it for me.

258
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:01,750
-Hey, Akutsu!

259
00:16:01,783 --> 00:16:03,050
Coach.

260
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,383
What did you mean, all he
has to do is win this match?

261
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:06,117
You didn't mean--

262
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,550
-Taichi.

263
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,183
-Yes, coach?

264
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:13,017
-Take a good look at the
two players out there.

265
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:13,950
-Huh?

266
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:16,050
-For many reasons,
this may prove

267
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:19,483
to be a critical match,
especially when it

268
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:20,717
comes to you.

269
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,917
-When it comes to me?

270
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:46,050
-As promised, I'll play you.

271
00:16:49,117 --> 00:16:50,750
-OK, whatever.

272
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:52,983
-Hey, you there.

273
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:54,183
Stop acting confrontational.

274
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,417
Both players, take
your positions.

275
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,250
-What's that crazy
guy's problem?

276
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:10,583
Is he trying to pick a
fight from the start?

277
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:13,617
-It looks like he's
not gonna let it be.

278
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,283
-Argh!

279
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:16,117
Such a bad attitude.

280
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,417
-He seems so vicious.

281
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:18,917
-Ryoma.

282
00:17:22,283 --> 00:17:23,983
-It's like it's deja vu.

283
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:26,550
A fated match.

284
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,417
Wouldn't you say so, Coach?

285
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,817
-It's not fate or
anything like that.

286
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,783
Nanjiro is simply
Najiro, Ryoma is Ryoma.

287
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:38,050
To each his own brand of tennis.

288
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,917
-Akutsu is a bit of a
temperamental player.

289
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,683
Ryoma will need to
be careful with him.

290
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:45,083
-Give me a break.

291
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:46,750
Compared to when I
was in middle school,

292
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:48,550
he's as tame as a rotten banana.

293
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,245
-Huh?

294
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:54,283
ANNOUNCER: One set match.

295
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:55,883
Seigaku's Echizen to serve.

296
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,050
-A service dash?

297
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,250
-What's Echizen thinking?

298
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:29,483
-I warned him not
to rush the net.

299
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:30,183
-Hey.

300
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:30,950
What's with that serve?

301
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,950
That wasn't the
serve I expected.

302
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:44,750
-Good one.

303
00:18:44,783 --> 00:18:46,683
It's a drop volley.

304
00:18:46,717 --> 00:18:47,150
-Heh.

305
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:56,850
You better not underestimate me.

306
00:19:05,783 --> 00:19:15,683
-Drive A.

307
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:16,417
-Akutsu, no!

308
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,883
-Hitting a drive volley
from that short distance,

309
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,683
that's intense.

310
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:28,550
-He sure is his father's son.

311
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,417
One can certainly see that.

312
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,817
-Uh.

313
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,883
-What a riot.

314
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:35,150
But I suppose it takes
at least that much

315
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:36,183
to get into the groove.

316
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:43,517
-Oops.

317
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,250
Sorry about that.

318
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:48,050
But it's just
that, you shouldn't

319
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,317
underrate tennis the way you do.

320
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,717
[laughing]

321
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:25,324
[theme music]

322
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:58,091
-I'm Akutsu, a ninth grader
from Yamabuki Junior High.

323
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,758
Tennis is boring to me.

324
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,558
Are you telling me I'm
a disgrace to the game?

325
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,391
I think those who only
talk the talk are sissies.

326
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:07,224
Hey, punk.

327
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:08,491
I'll play you, as I promised.

328
00:21:08,524 --> 00:21:10,758
If you have any problems
with that, all you have to do

329
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,291
is beat me first.

330
00:21:13,324 --> 00:21:16,291
Next on "The Prince of
Tennis," A Devil on the Court.

331
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:19,491
And don't even think
about ordering me around.
