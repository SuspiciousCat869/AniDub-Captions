1
00:00:07,484 --> 00:00:08,417
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): Man.

2
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:09,417
Oishi's tenacious.

3
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:15,784
TOMOKA: He got it!

4
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:17,284
HORIO: The return's too low.

5
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,617
It'll go in the net!

6
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:21,851
OISHI (VOICEOVER): Not with
Echizen's power, it won't.

7
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:36,784
[theme music]

8
00:01:54,423 --> 00:01:55,856
-Yes, that's right.

9
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,456
Yeah, I got it.

10
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,090
Sure.

11
00:01:58,123 --> 00:01:58,790
I'll see you soon.

12
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:02,356
Now then.

13
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,656
-Hm.

14
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:14,123
-Oh, so this is where
you were, Shiba, huh?

15
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:17,123
Hey, are these the photos
from when you went to Seigaku?

16
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:18,856
-I had to do something, right?

17
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,356
I can't just follow you around.

18
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,190
-Well, that's a good attitude.

19
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:26,690
Did you catch anything
interesting in these, Shiba?

20
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:27,890
Wow, look at this.

21
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:33,990
Hm.

22
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:34,956
Hey.

23
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,890
-Yes?

24
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,523
-Isn't this Kirihara?

25
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:41,356
So, he was at Seigaku?

26
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,156
-That's right.

27
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,356
Do you know him, Mr. Inoue?

28
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,423
-Of course I do.

29
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:48,790
Akaya Kirihara is
the eighth grade ace

30
00:02:48,823 --> 00:02:52,656
at Rikkai, the school that
fields the top team from Kanto.

31
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,956
Just like Ryoma, he's
a junior high kid

32
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,690
who can do the split step.

33
00:02:57,723 --> 00:03:01,356
SHIBA: Well, his tennis may be
good, but that not his manners.

34
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,323
He called me old!

35
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:02,990
Argh!

36
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:03,923
Can you believe it?

37
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:05,690
[mumbling]

38
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:07,723
-Gah!

39
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:10,423
I'll get back at him if
it's the last thing I do.

40
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,723
-Maybe he came to
scout the competition.

41
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:14,190
-Huh?

42
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:17,723
-That must mean they
consider Seigaku a threat.

43
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,423
It looks like the
Kanto tournament

44
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:21,956
is getting more and more
interesting, huh Shiba?

45
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,723
Come on.

46
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:23,956
Let's go cover the story.

47
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,590
-All right.

48
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:25,390
Here's what we do.

49
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:28,290
We go to Rikkai first, right?

50
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:28,823
-No.

51
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:29,856
To Seigaku.

52
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,190
-Huh?

53
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:32,590
Wait, I don't get it.

54
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,456
So, now tell me again.

55
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,756
Why are we going to Seigaku?

56
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,990
We know what all the regulars.

57
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:43,023
What's the deal?

58
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,290
-You don't understand
anything, do you?

59
00:03:45,323 --> 00:03:46,990
-OK, what have you
been keeping from me?

60
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:48,490
Come on, cough it up.

61
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:50,290
INOUE: Don't worry,
you'll understand soon.

62
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:07,123
-Well, that's unusual.

63
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:09,856
-Even I wash my face sometimes.

64
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,190
-That's not it.

65
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:13,356
It's just that I've never
seen you wash your face prior

66
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,856
to a match before.

67
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,690
-Don't worry, Tezuka.

68
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:22,256
The weather is nice.

69
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,356
-Yeah.

70
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,723
-I'll just go on ahead.

71
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:42,990
-So, wanna go?

72
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:54,823
-Oh, that looks scary.

73
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:57,790
Oishi Sure looks like he's out
for blood this time around.

74
00:04:57,823 --> 00:04:58,823
-Quit your jabbering.

75
00:04:58,856 --> 00:04:59,556
It's distracting.

76
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:06,923
-That's part of the
strategy, Kaidoh.

77
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:09,656
The game begins in
the locker room.

78
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,956
I hear the pros do
it all the time.

79
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,990
-What am I supposed to do
against all those big shots?

80
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:19,623
-Take it easy.

81
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:20,356
It's only tennis.

82
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,256
-But then again, it
is tennis, right?

83
00:05:32,223 --> 00:05:33,523
Taka, you forgot your racket.

84
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:38,356
-Still have a ways to go.

85
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,823
INOUE: Shiba, you
ready to rock and roll?

86
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:59,856
-I'm all set.

87
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,390
Hey, Mr. Inoue.

88
00:06:01,423 --> 00:06:02,656
-Hm?

89
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,856
-I think this is going to
be a very exciting story.

90
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,923
INOUE: That's true.

91
00:06:07,956 --> 00:06:11,523
You never know what's
gonna happen here.

92
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:13,756
That's why it's so interesting.

93
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,323
Now do you understand?

94
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:16,723
-Of course.

95
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:21,223
I'd like to think that I always
had a good eye for the story.

96
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,156
INOUE: You know,
you may be right.

97
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,190
SHIBA: Well, I'd count
on it, if I were you.

98
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,590
RYUZAKI: Listen up.

99
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,356
The Kanto tournament is the
toughest one we've faced yet.

100
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,356
Top notch players who we
haven't heard of may pop up,

101
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,156
so it's important that we
field the best team possible.

102
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,356
We're really gonna need our
strongest players out there,

103
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,356
so our top two
winners of each block

104
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,223
are probably the
smartest guys to field.

105
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:48,456
Don't get down.

106
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,190
-Right!

107
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:53,590
-Man, it's so tense around here.

108
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:55,723
-That's for sure.

109
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:57,690
Hey, what's going on now?

110
00:06:57,723 --> 00:06:59,023
-It's Ryuzaki.

111
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:00,756
She's doing the
inter team ranking.

112
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,656
-Ooh, the ranking tournament.

113
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,956
-Oh yeah.

114
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,190
Seigaku's the only school that
has these monthly matches,

115
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:08,690
and I think they're the
biggest secret to our success.

116
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:11,556
-Except the seventh graders
aren't allowed to enter them.

117
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,490
-Of course you know, Ryoma's
the big exception to the rule,

118
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:15,523
as usual.

119
00:07:15,556 --> 00:07:16,556
-Oh, I see.

120
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,590
Now it makes sense.

121
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:18,990
It's a ranking tournament.

122
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:20,690
-Hi, Ms. Shiba.

123
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:23,223
-If any of you think
you're a shoe in,

124
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:25,223
you are sorely mistaken.

125
00:07:25,256 --> 00:07:27,256
This ranking
tournament alone will

126
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,223
determine who plays in
the Kanto tournament.

127
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:31,123
Got it?

128
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:32,156
-Yes.

129
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,156
-Let me put it to
you another way.

130
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,256
Right now, anyone
could make the team.

131
00:07:51,623 --> 00:07:52,890
-All right.

132
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:54,323
We're ready to get started
with the ranking tournament.

133
00:07:54,356 --> 00:07:57,790
Please go to your
assigned courts now.

134
00:07:57,823 --> 00:07:58,423
TEAM: Yes!

135
00:07:58,456 --> 00:07:59,056
KAIDOH: Whatever.

136
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:09,990
ANNOUNCER: Game

137
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,556

138
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,056
Burning!

139
00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:30,756
All right!

140
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,523
ANNOUNCER: Game and
match to Kawamura.

141
00:08:32,556 --> 00:08:33,190
-Yes!

142
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:34,423
Way to go, Kawamura.

143
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,656
-A moon volley.

144
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,290
-You're looking
good today, buddy.

145
00:08:57,323 --> 00:08:58,756
ANNOUNCER: Game
and match to Oishi.

146
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:05,990
Game and match to Nagayama.

147
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:08,256
-Man, the field is
quickly narrowing.

148
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,356
-Yeah.

149
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,090
The regulars are
sure cleaning up.

150
00:09:11,123 --> 00:09:13,990
-But that Block A sure
looks mighty tough.

151
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:15,856
After all, Inui's still there.

152
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,623
So is Momo and Captain
Tezuka as well.

153

ANNOUNCER: Game and match to
Tezuka, six games to Love.

154
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:29,590
-Hm?

155
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:36,756
Here it comes,
Momo's dunk smash.

156
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:42,723
-Boom.

157
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,290
ANNOUNCER: Game and
match to Momoshiro.

158
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:54,456
BOY: Wow, again.

159
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,190
He didn't lose a single point.

160
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,890
-Uh, well, thank you
for the great game.

161
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:02,623
-Your approach to
the net isn't bad,

162
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:04,990
but try coming in
a little earlier.

163
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:05,956
-Uh, OK.

164
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,107
BOY: Aw, man.

165
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,407
If I lose today, I'm
out of the tournament.

166
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,073
BOY: I haven't even
won a game yet.

167
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:46,440
-Here!

168
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,673
-There it is!

169
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:56,473
Kaidoh's snake!

170
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,507

[hiss]

172
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,207
-What a boring game that was.

173
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:12,773
That loser's in Block D.

174
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:14,073
ANNOUNCER: Match point, Echizen.

175
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:20,207
-Hey.

176
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,807
You still have a ways to go.

177
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:39,407
-It's a kick serve!

178
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,507

-I guess you just weren't
lucky in the draw, that's all.

181
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:56,473
-Echizen, take it
easy on me, will you?

182
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,773
-Why should I?

183
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,007
-Well, it's just as we
expected it to turn out.

184
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,140
Looks like the regulars
are all going through.

185
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:07,407
-Well, that's no surprise.

186
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,807
They're all doing really well.

187
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,440
-No surprise?

188
00:12:11,473 --> 00:12:11,940
-Huh?

189
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:28,240
ANNOUNCER: Game and match
to Inui, six games to Love.

190
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:32,773
-According to my calculations,
you were short 45 centimeters.

191
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:34,573
-We may have one more yet.

192
00:12:34,607 --> 00:12:36,673
Seigaku's former number three.

193
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:39,140
Our data champ still
has some game in him.

194
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,773
-Wow.

195
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,507
Looks like Inui's
really fired up today.

196
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,873
I'm sure glad I'm
not in his block.

197
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:51,640
-Yeah.

198
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:55,440
I wanna go watch Block A.

199
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:56,440
-Don't sweat it.

200
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:59,307
His game looks really bad.

201
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,273
BOY: You see that?

202
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:02,673
Only two will remain
from each block.

203
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:05,440
BOY: It stinks that one of these
two guys has to lose his spot.

204
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:21,007
ANNOUNCER: Game and match to
Kikumaru, six games to Love.

205
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,140
-All right.

206
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:25,473
Hey, I'm the first
one to get a slot.

207
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:26,873
-No way.

208
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,807
Kikumaru is just
on a roll today.

209
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,240
-Hey, Arai, you're looking
at straight bagels.

210
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:33,407
-Aw, shut up.

211
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,007
When are we ever
going to be regulars?

212
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,007
I'm sick and tired of this.

213
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,940
-Eiji's lucky.

214
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:40,407
He's already won
his regular spot.

215
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:49,240
-Ha ha ha!

216
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:50,307
Don't you worry.

217
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,307
I'm a super regular.

218
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,073
Ha ha!

219
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:55,040
All right, all right.

220
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:55,840
So, you came fight?

221
00:13:55,873 --> 00:13:56,573
Come on, come on!

222
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,207
Challenge me.

223
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,273
Let's go!

224
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,273
On fire!

225
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:08,840
-That means the regulars
will be Kikumaru, Kawamura,

226
00:14:08,873 --> 00:14:12,407
Fuji, and five others.

227
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,073
-Tomorrow's match is
between Oishi and Ryoma.

228
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:18,507
-Neither one's lost a
match yet, but they're both

229
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,373
sure to get places.

230
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:22,973
-And that means three more.

231
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:25,073
But who's stronger?

232
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:26,740
-Is it Oishi or Ryoma?

233
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:27,940
We'll find out tomorrow.

234
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:41,440
OISHI: What a beauty.

235
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:43,173
RYOMA (VOICEOVER):
Man, Oishi's tenacious.

236
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:51,673
TOMOKA: He's got it!

237
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:53,140
HORIO: The return's too low!

238
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:56,140
It'll go in the net!

239
00:14:56,173 --> 00:14:59,607
OISHI (VOICEOVER): Not with
Echizen's power, it won't.

240
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,107
I'm a ninth grader.

241
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,107
I've got seniority.

242
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,107
I can't lose to
some seventh grader.

243
00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:14,373
BOY: I just knew
Oishi would get to it.

244
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:16,373
Amazing.

245
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:18,340
OISHI: Can you
reach it, Echizen?

246
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,673
ANNOUNCER: Out.

247
00:15:34,707 --> 00:15:39,407
Game and match to Echizen,
six games to three.

248
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,973
-Wow, judging
instantly up in the air

249
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,207
whether the ball
might be in or not.

250
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,073
Ryoma Echizen is incredible.

251
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:47,207
-All right, Ryoma.

252
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,473
He made the cut.

253
00:15:51,473 --> 00:15:52,607
-Good game, pal.

254
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,107
You're one tough opponent.

255
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,073
But guess what?

256
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:57,373
With one loss, I
made the team too.

257
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:03,707
-Ah.

258
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,040
This feels good.

259
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:10,173
Man, this heat's
making me tired.

260
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:11,140
-What's up with him?

261
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:12,840
He hasn't even done anything.

262
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:14,940
-Ryoma, I've been
meaning to tell you,

263
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:16,973
congratulations on your big win.

264
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:20,873
-You didn't lose
one single match.

265
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:22,707
Only three players left, huh?

266
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:54,940
-Echizen did some job on me.

267
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,040
What's wrong, Eiji?

268
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,973
-Hurry up, Momo's
match is gonna end

269
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:06,440
before you can say slam dunk.

270
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:09,540
-Hey, shut up, you pipsqueak.

271
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:12,373
-Sorry!

272
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,373
[hiss]

273
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:17,907
-Kaidoh always scares
the daylights out of me.

274
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,773
-Come on, you better
simmer down, Horio.

275
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:23,707
The match is just
about to begin.

276
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,540
HORIO: What?

277
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:25,873
You mean it hasn't started yet?

278
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:29,940
-It's all over.

279
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:30,673
You missed it.

280
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:41,540
-Huh?

281
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:43,140
-Momo didn't win.

282
00:17:43,173 --> 00:17:44,073
Is that true?

283
00:17:57,373 --> 00:18:00,173
Momo won against that junior
all-star player Sengoku,

284
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:03,073
but he only took two
games against Inui.

285
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:05,607
Plus he lost to Tezuka.

286
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,040
His score now stands at
three wins and two losses.

287
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:11,740
-Then that means Momo's
lost his regular slot.

288
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:12,607
-Horio stop!

289
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,373
[mumbling]

290
00:18:26,407 --> 00:18:29,907
-Hey, do you think that
Momo's leg is hurting?

291
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,373
It might still be
cramping on him.

292
00:18:34,407 --> 00:18:36,673
-No, that wasn't it.

293
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:38,773
He was actually in great shape.

294
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:41,240
-What went wrong?

295
00:18:41,273 --> 00:18:43,673
-Well, I think Inui
just played a great game

296
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:44,640
and overwhelmed Momo.

297
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,040
These past two months, during
the preliminaries and also

298
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:56,007
the Metropolitan Tournament,
he hasn't been just gathering

299
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,607
data on our opponents.

300
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,973
No, not at all.

301
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:05,107
-Well now.

302
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,640
So, tell me, how
does it feel to have

303
00:19:06,673 --> 00:19:08,473
been analyzed for
the last two months?

304
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,440
-So, he's been gathering
data on us too.

305
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:30,940
[hiss]

306
00:19:30,973 --> 00:19:31,907
-Wow.

307
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,340
I never imagined
that the competition

308
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:36,173
was so fierce within the team.

309
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:39,373
-Well, these guys are aiming
for the top tier, right?

310
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,240
-Tezuka.

311
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:57,273
I've gathered my data.

312
00:19:57,307 --> 00:19:59,073
This time, I'm going to win.

313
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:15,240
Without fail.

314
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,137
[theme music]

315
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:01,137
INUI: This is Sadaharu Inui.

316
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,737
The long-waited inter
team ranking tournament

317
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,470
is finally here.

318
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:09,370
I haven't forgotten the
feeling when I lost to Echizen,

319
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:12,703
or how I felt as I've lost
to you for the last three

320
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:14,870
years, Captain Tezuka.

321
00:21:14,903 --> 00:21:17,670
My detailed data and
intensive training

322
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:21,570
were all just preparations
for this moment.

323
00:21:21,603 --> 00:21:25,703
This time, I will win
against Captain Tezuka.
