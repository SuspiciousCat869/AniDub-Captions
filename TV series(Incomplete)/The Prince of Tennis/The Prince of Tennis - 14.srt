1
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:11,295
TAKASHI (VOICEOVER): We're the
ones who are going to win this.

2
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:15,262
FUJI (VOICEOVER): Man, their
willpower is intimidating.

3
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:17,462
This match will
determine the outcome

4
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:18,462
of the whole tournament.

5
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:26,362
This ends now.

6
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:29,862
[theme music]

7
00:01:44,777 --> 00:01:47,777
-Hey, don't we play Mizuno
Fuji Junior High after lunch?

8
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,044
-That's right.

9
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:50,744
-Tezuka and Fuji.

10
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,644
So you checking out
the competition, huh?

11
00:01:53,677 --> 00:01:56,310
Figured out anything
I should now?

12
00:01:56,344 --> 00:02:01,544
By the way, Tezuka, I hear you
didn't play against Kyokurin.

13
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:05,310
Is there some problem you're
not telling anybody about?

14
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:07,010
-Let's go, Fuji.

15
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,177
-Hang on.

16
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,410
Let's see that arm.

17
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:11,744
Maybe there's an injury.

18
00:02:14,877 --> 00:02:15,410
-Let go.

19
00:02:17,544 --> 00:02:18,977
(VOICEOVER): He
didn't even flinch.

20
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,744
I'll get to the bottom of this
if it's the last thing I do.

21
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,777
ANNOUNCER: Game and
match to Fudomine.

22
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:41,877
-No.

23
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,410
It's impossible.

24
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:55,744
What a nightmare.

25
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:56,877
They were never this good.

26
00:03:02,877 --> 00:03:03,777
-What?

27
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,577
Kakinoki lost?

28
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,677
No way.

29
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,377
They were candidates
for the metropolitans.

30
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,744
-But I'm telling
you it's true, Momo.

31
00:03:10,777 --> 00:03:12,477
It's even there on
the match schedule.

32
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:26,710
-Now that you mention it, I
wonder where Ryoma is too.

33
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:27,677
-Ah.

34
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,677
But that's not what
I was thinking.

35
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,877
-Oh, it's OK.

36
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,477
I know.

37
00:03:35,177 --> 00:03:37,544
-So who do we get to
play in the finals?

38
00:03:37,577 --> 00:03:39,144
-Fudomine Junior High.

39
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,277
-They're not even seeded.

40
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,577
-Fudomine?.

41
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,844
If I'm not mistaken, they
weren't allowed in the matches

42
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:44,410
last year.

43
00:03:44,444 --> 00:03:44,910
-Huh?

44
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,977
-Now it makes sense.

45
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,277
That's why they were
turned away last year.

46
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,977
You've been a big help to me.

47
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,344
It's a great
comfort to know I've

48
00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:01,777
got at least one friend
at the newspaper.

49
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,444
Thanks again.

50
00:04:02,477 --> 00:04:02,944
Goodbye.

51
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:08,110
INOUE (VOICEOVER):
Refused entry to matches.

52
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:13,110
Team captain, Kippei Tachibana,
at that time an eighth grader,

53
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:16,110
due to an incident of violence.

54
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:16,910
Hm.

55
00:04:16,944 --> 00:04:17,544
Violence, huh?

56
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,810
-Hey there.

57
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:28,277
I just Fudomine play.

58
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,910
They have a completely
different team from last year.

59
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:32,777
With the exception
of Captain Tachibana,

60
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,044
their regular team is made
up of only eighth graders.

61
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:39,410
The key is their team
captain, Kippei Tachibana,

62
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:40,677
a ninth grader.

63
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,544
He's also acting as their coach.

64
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:44,344
And a completely
unknown eighth grader

65
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:47,144
was able to beat Kuki
from Kakinoki 6-2.

66
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,510
-I guess it's safe to
say it's not a given

67
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:54,277
that we'll win this tournament.

68
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,544
-Seigaku's got nothing to worry
about from these new kids.

69
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,344
I tell you, Seigaku's gonna win.

70
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:00,877
-Um, Horio?

71
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,777
-Come on, I'm on
a roll right now.

72
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,777
There's just no way on
earth Seigaku's going

73
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,710
to lose to those unseeded kids.

74
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:07,444
No way.

75
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:08,410
-Hey, Horio.

76
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:09,110
-What is it?

77
00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:11,444
Can't you see I-- oh.

78
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,277
Fu-- Fudomine.

79
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:43,844
-You're Tezuka from
Seigaku, right?

80
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,710
-That's correct.

81
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:48,110
-I'm Tachibana, the
Fudomine captain.

82
00:05:58,144 --> 00:05:59,410
Let's have a good match.

83
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:00,644
-Good luck.

84
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:01,577
-Oh, man.

85
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,777
What a surprise.

86
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,910
I thought we were really
in for it with those guys.

87
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:06,944
-They sure look tough.

88
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:08,544
-What's wrong with you, Horio?

89
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,944
-My knees went
and buckled on me.

90
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,744
-That guy in the back
keeps bouncing that ball

91
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:25,244
without even looking.

92
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:26,744
Those Fudomine guys are amazing.

93
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,944
-That [inaudible],
he's just trying

94
00:06:44,977 --> 00:06:47,444
to stir up trouble again.

95
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:50,077
-I guess after playing
doubles and then sitting out,

96
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,110
the stress is beginning
to get to him.

97
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:53,177
[laughter]

98
00:06:58,644 --> 00:07:02,544
TACHIBANA (VOICEOVER):
A seventh grader, huh?

99
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:03,810
-Come on, let's go.

100
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:12,910
-You still have a ways to go.

101
00:07:12,944 --> 00:07:14,910
-This should be fun, huh Shinji?

102
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:16,110
-Yeah.

103
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,310
-OK, listen up.

104
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:19,477
The team you're meeting
in the finals is Fudomine.

105
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,677
They're not like any
team you've met so far.

106
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,877
-Yes, ma'am.

107
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,944
-Here's the lineup.

108
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,410
Number two doubles
is Fuji and Kawamura.

109
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:28,910
Number one doubles,
Oishi and Kikumaru.

110
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:30,677
Number three singles is Kaidoh.

111
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,210
Don't lose this one.

112
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,177
Number two singles is Ryoma.

113
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,477
Go wild, kid.

114
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,610
And number one singles
will be Tezuka.

115
00:07:38,644 --> 00:07:40,810
-Ryoma is finally
debuting in singles.

116
00:07:40,844 --> 00:07:42,744
-Hey, way to go, Ryoma.

117
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:53,877
-The finals will be between
Seigaku and Fudomine.

118
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,744
Seigaku's got this
one in the bag.

119
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:58,744
-Yeah, it's a number one seed
against an unseeded team.

120
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,477
ANNOUNCER: This is
a one set match.

121
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,510
Sakurai of Fudomine to serve.

122
00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:06,310
-It's finally starting.

123
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:07,577
-Come on, you're a newsman.

124
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,177
Surely you can find that out.

125
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,377
-Oh, it's Mr. Inoue.

126
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,377
Wonder if he's going to
watch the finals matches.

127
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,444
-I won't take up too
much of your time.

128
00:08:17,477 --> 00:08:19,577
I'd just like to ask you
a few questions concerning

129
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,944
your previous work as adviser
to the Fudomine tennis team,

130
00:08:22,977 --> 00:08:25,377
specifically about
the day you quit.

131
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,044
Hello?

132
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:26,877
Hello?

133
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,244
No comment, eh?

134
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:29,710
Thanks so very much.

135
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:32,210
Bye.

136
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:34,710
-Are you a reporter
for a tennis magazine?

137
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:35,477
-Well, yes, I am.

138
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,477
How could you tell?

139
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,877
-I heard you say
on your cell phone

140
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,810
that you were Mr. Inoue of the
monthly magazine "Tennis Pro."

141
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:41,844
-Yeah.

142
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:44,010
-Are you investigating
the Fudomine team?

143
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:44,910
-Huh?

144
00:08:44,944 --> 00:08:46,344
Do you know anything about them?

145
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:48,177
-I know they're a
really strong team.

146
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,844
Fudomine's like this soda.

147
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:58,777
Doesn't look like much from
the outside, but on the inside,

148
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,544
there's this huge
power just waiting

149
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:03,277
to surprise those who
aren't expecting it.

150
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,677
They are truly an amazing team.

151
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:09,810
-Huh?

152
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:10,677
W-- w-- wait.

153
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,510
At Least tell me your name.

154
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:14,977
-An.

155
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,210
Uh, about that bottle.

156
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:18,410
I wouldn't open
it up right away.

157
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:18,910
-Huh?

158
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:27,177
-Look out.

159
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,044
Now I'm on fire.

160
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:31,244
-What a return.

161
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,110
-[inaudible].

162
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,610
ANNOUNCER: 30-15.

163
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:50,477
-Oh-- oh brother.

164
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,744
-They're unseeded.

165
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:54,110
How could they turn
out to be so good?

166
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,410
-They're experts
of heavy top spin.

167
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:02,977
-They're much stronger
than I expected.

168
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:13,010
-Fuji is playing in
number two doubles.

169
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:15,510
That's not quite what you
figured on, is it, captain?

170
00:10:15,544 --> 00:10:16,877
-No.

171
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,510
I thought he'd go up against
Shinji in number two singles.

172
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:20,610
-Don't worry about it.

173
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:22,544
He looks like he's
having fun against them.

174
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:29,210
-You're probably right.

175
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,944
-Hm?

176
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:38,410
-Isn't that their team captain?

177
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:39,810
What's he think
he's doing leaving

178
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:41,144
in the middle of a match?

179
00:10:41,177 --> 00:10:42,677
-It's quite a surprise.

180
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,310
-He must be pretty
confident if he

181
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:47,077
doesn't think he needs to
stay and watch the outcome.

182
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,177
-We took them too
lightly, didn't we?

183
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,244
ANNOUNCER: Service eighth.

184
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,610
40-15.

185
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:13,210
-Huh?

186
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,910
-Want some?

187
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:17,677
-No.

188
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,777
Thanks for offering.

189
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,477
-You're Kippei Tachibana
from Fudomine, right?

190
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,977
Your team is like
this bottle of soda.

191
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,044
A young lady said that
when she gave this to me.

192
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:29,644
I wonder what she meant.

193
00:11:29,677 --> 00:11:31,110
It could be profound.

194
00:11:31,144 --> 00:11:31,877
Don't you think so?

195
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:35,710
-What do you want?

196
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:37,610
-Please, there's no reason
to get your guard up.

197
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:38,844
It's OK.

198
00:11:38,877 --> 00:11:40,977
I'm a reporter, but I don't
work for a scandal rag.

199
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,810
I do my reporting for
a tennis magazine.

200
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:45,377
There's something
I'd like to ask you.

201
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,677
It's for personal reasons.

202
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,977
Is that OK?

203
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,277
Uh, I'd like you to tell me
about the violent incident

204
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,844
last year.

205
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:13,426
-Got it.

206
00:12:21,426 --> 00:12:23,392
-What a terrific rally.

207
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:25,659
-Those guys from Fudomine
are really persistent.

208
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:29,326
-I can't stand to watch if our
guys are going to lose to them.

209
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:38,126
-Fuji and Kawamura
are being pushed back.

210
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,359
-Fudomine keeps
returning every shot.

211
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,459
I really hate those
type of players.

212
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:44,459
-It's a battle of patience.

213
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:46,792
The team that can throw
the other side off balance

214
00:12:46,826 --> 00:12:47,926
will be the team that wins.

215
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:55,192
-I promise you, I
won't ever write about.

216
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:56,892
-Then why ask me?

217
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:59,392
-To know the secret of
your team's strength.

218
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:02,092
Like I said, I report
for a tennis magazine.

219
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:04,592
I don't write about
anything but tennis.

220
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:07,359
It's not just my job,
it's my whole life.

221
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:10,192
The girl who gave me this
bottle also gave me a riddle.

222
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:20,426
Like this bottle, your team
hides amazing strength inside.

223
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:24,326
She said Fudomine was
different than they looked.

224
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:27,259
I've been wondering, could
last year's violent incident

225
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:30,159
have something to do with your
school's strength at tennis?

226
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:32,059
I can't help but
feeling that it does.

227
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:32,992
Am I wrong?

228
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,192
I know you punched
out your advisor.

229
00:13:39,226 --> 00:13:40,692
That's what caused
you to be ejected

230
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:42,159
from the district matches.

231
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:44,726
That's about all I know
about the incident.

232
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,059
I don't care that you hit him.

233
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,759
I just want to know why.

234
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:52,659
-Mr. Inoue.

235
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:53,826
-Hm?

236
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:55,659
-If you promise me you
won't write about it,

237
00:13:55,692 --> 00:13:57,359
I'll tell you what happened.

238
00:13:57,392 --> 00:13:57,859
-Done.

239
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,792
-So you new kids want
to play matches, huh?

240
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:11,592
Now, when did I ever promise
you anything like that?

241
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:14,092
-You said if we played upper
class teammates and won,

242
00:14:14,126 --> 00:14:15,992
we'd be on the regular team.

243
00:14:16,026 --> 00:14:17,692
-And when did I say that?

244
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:19,592
You're still just
seventh graders.

245
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,159
You should be happy just
picking up tennis balls.

246
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:22,659
-Huh?

247
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:26,559
-Yeah?

248
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:27,626
And what do you want?

249
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,726
-Kippei Tachibana.

250
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,526
I've just transferred
to this school.

251
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,526
I'm in the eighth grade.

252
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:42,892
-Hey, are you all right?

253
00:14:42,926 --> 00:14:44,526
-Don't got tattling
to the adviser.

254
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,592
You hear?

255
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:47,726
And don't rebel
against upperclassmen.

256
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,292
Respect the ranks.

257
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:51,092
TACHIBANA (VOICEOVER):
It was unforgivable.

258
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:54,092
With an advisor who wouldn't
do anything and bullying older

259
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,192
teammates with no
skills but big heads,

260
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:59,359
the poor seventh graders who
only wanted to play tennis

261
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:01,859
were treated horribly.

262
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:03,426
-Pick up those balls.

263
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:04,092
Go on.

264
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:04,959
Quit being so lazy.

265
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:13,059
That's not the spirit.

266
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:13,826
Get running.

267
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:15,226
20 times around the field.

268
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:17,192
Move it.

269
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:19,059
-You're the ones who
are going to be running.

270
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:20,159
-What did you say?

271
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:21,692
Watch yourself, Tachibana.

272
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:23,792
-You've got nerve
talking like that.

273
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:26,159
-Play a match against
me if you're not afraid.

274
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:31,659
And if I win, you get to run
20 times around the field,

275
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:33,159
or at least until you drop.

276
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:42,826
-That's stupid.

277
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,092
-Who'd want to do that?

278
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:44,792
-Forget it.

279
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:45,726
I'm out of here.

280
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:52,392
-Anyone think they're
stronger than me?

281
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:53,092
Step up.

282
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:11,559
-What's that you say?

283
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:13,959
All the seventh
graders are boycotting?

284
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:15,292
They're making a new team?

285
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:17,492
-Yeah, and the one behind
the whole thing is Tachibana.

286
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:23,759
-Hey, Tachibana.

287
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,859
Last time, we cut
you a lot of slack,

288
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:29,659
but it seems like you just
don't want to learn, do you?

289
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:32,892
-You guys don't lay a
hand on any of them, OK?

290
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:36,359
-You brats are such a pain.

291
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:38,992
So this is the new team, huh?

292
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:41,126
Well, from now
until next spring,

293
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,592
you're going to spend your
time picking up tennis balls

294
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:44,726
and be happy about it.

295
00:16:48,026 --> 00:16:49,426
After all, they
started the fight.

296
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:50,226
Right, guys?

297
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,059
[laughter]

298
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:56,092
-Tachibana, hold on a sec.

299
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:58,426
-You're a failure as an advisor.

300
00:16:58,459 --> 00:16:59,226
-What the--

301
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:13,692
-I can't believe it.

302
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:15,726
And you were the one who
said not to touch them.

303
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,026
-Aw, shut up.

304
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:19,859
After all, you guys weren't
shy about getting into it.

305
00:17:19,892 --> 00:17:20,992
Now, look sharp.

306
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:22,992
We're applying to
create a new team.

307
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:29,992
-You think they'll say OK?

308
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:32,159
-We'll hang in
there until they do.

309
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:34,359
We're shooting for nationals.

310
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:37,392
-Nationals,
nationals, nationals.

311
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:45,159
-So that's the story.

312
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:47,492
That worthless advisor
and all the upperclassmen

313
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,459
left the tennis team soon after.

314
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:50,826
-I understand.

315
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:54,392
That incident is the root cause
of your strength as a team.

316
00:17:54,426 --> 00:17:56,026
Thank you for telling
me all about it.

317
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:57,326
-You're wrong.

318
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:02,026
What happened was just an
opportunity, and we took it.

319
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:04,459
We don't care about
events of the past.

320
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:07,726
We're just not going to lose to
anybody, no matter who it is.

321
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,226
That's all there is to it.

322
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:10,959
-That was quite a smash.

323
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:11,859
-I wouldn't say that.

324
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:14,292
-Really?

325
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,659
-It's about time for Seigaku
to begin their counterattack.

326
00:18:17,692 --> 00:18:18,426
Excuse me.

327
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,526
INOUE (VOICEOVER): Hm.

328
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,026
Fudomine.

329
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:33,559
-Hey, guys.

330
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:35,292
Their captain's just come back.

331
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,359
-His leaving was on purpose.

332
00:18:43,392 --> 00:18:43,892
-Huh?

333
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:44,726
On purpose?

334
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,359
-Wait.

335
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:46,226
What do you mean?

336
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,826
-An excellent strategy.

337
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:49,559
During an important
match, the captain

338
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:51,426
makes a big show of
leaving the court,

339
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:54,059
causing a distraction which
puts more pressure on us

340
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,592
while reducing our
ability to focus.

341
00:18:56,626 --> 00:19:00,492
TAKASHI (VOICEOVER): We're the
ones who are going to win this.

342
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:04,359
FUJI (VOICEOVER): Their
willpower is intimidating.

343
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:06,459
This match will
determine the outcome

344
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:07,959
of the entire tournament.

345
00:19:13,992 --> 00:19:15,459
This ends now.

346
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:33,992
-It didn't even bounce.

347
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:35,426
-What was that?

348
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:37,759
It just skidded along the ground
until it went right past them.

349
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,392
-That's one of the
best counter shots

350
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:42,292
Fuji has in his arsenal,
the triple counter.

351
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:43,826
-The triple counter?

352
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:46,192
-He uses his opponent's
top spin on the ball

353
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,359
and adds even more spin
in the same direction

354
00:19:48,392 --> 00:19:50,059
by means of a
heavy slice counter

355
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:53,292
shot that's almost
impossible to return.

356
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:58,192
He might be a problem,
this genius Shusuke Fuji.

357
00:19:58,226 --> 00:20:00,559
-Mr. Inoue, where
have you been hiding?

358
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:01,592
-Is something the matter?

359
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:11,926
-This match up
Seigaku might not win.

360
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:27,165
[theme music]

361
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,226
FUJI (VOICEOVER): Hi.

362
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,093
I'm Shusuke Fuji.

363
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:02,393
Taka and I are playing Ishida
and Sakurai from Fudomine.

364
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:05,726
With my triple counter shot,
the match should be ours.

365
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,593
But Fudomine is coming back
with a devastating new weapon.

366
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:10,760
Are we in big trouble?

367
00:21:10,793 --> 00:21:11,793
Hm.

368
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:13,793
We'd better watch
out for these guys.

369
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:16,560
Next up, "To Each
His Own Battle."

370
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:19,293
Taka, you amaze me.
