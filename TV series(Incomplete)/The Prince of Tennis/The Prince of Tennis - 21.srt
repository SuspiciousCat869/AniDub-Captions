[music playing]

2
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:09,466
-So, it seems like the two of
you have been spying on us.

3
00:00:09,499 --> 00:00:11,899
That means both of you
have quite a bit of nerve.

4
00:00:11,932 --> 00:00:12,432
-Uh oh.

5
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:13,166
Kenzo, sir.

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:13,666
-Mm!

7
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,866
-Oh, hey, look.

8
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,066
It's Ryoma and Momoshiro.

9
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:22,466
-Hey.

10
00:00:22,499 --> 00:00:24,899
-(THINKING) That's the pretty
girl I saw a little while ago.

11
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:30,699
[laughing]

12
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:32,666
-Uh, sir, what's
the matter with you?

13
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,932
-It's all right now.

14
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:37,399
If you say you really want
it, I'll give you a chance.

15
00:00:37,432 --> 00:00:38,032
-Huh?

16
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:39,099
-All right, then.

17
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:40,566
Let's play a game.

00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:46,032
[theme music]

19
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:04,382
-There's some new people coming.

20
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,649
-Which school are they from.

21
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:10,382
-Excuse me.

22
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,149
Are you members of
the tennis team?

23
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:13,282
-Yeah, we sure are.

24
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:14,782
-You know where the
tennis court is?

25
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:16,949
-You'll see it after
you turn that corner.

26
00:02:16,982 --> 00:02:18,882
-Did practice already start?

27
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:19,582
-Yeah.

28
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:20,582
-We better hurry up.

29
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:21,782
-Yeah.

30
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:22,816
-Thank you.

31
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:23,749
-Gosh.

32
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:25,049
How many people
has it been today?

33
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:28,116
-That makes quite a few over
the past couple of days.

34
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,782
-And they're still
coming over here.

35
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:39,882
-I'm very sorry.

36
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,616
But I can't meet your demands.

37
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:45,849
Every school wants a
practice match with us.

38
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,849
They all seem to
be focused on us.

39
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:51,149
Is it Tezuka they want to see?

40
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:55,216
Or maybe it's-- hmm.

41
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:57,649
-That sushi tasted great.

42
00:02:57,682 --> 00:02:58,582
-Yeah.

43
00:02:58,616 --> 00:03:00,516
I hope we can go
back there again.

44
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:01,916
-Hmm?

45
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,982
-You know what, Fuji, I really
can't stand that camera that's

46
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:07,616
always following us,
even during breaks.

47
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:10,182
I wonder how many schools
are here to watch us.

48
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:12,782
-Let's see.

49
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:13,316
-Whoa!

50
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:14,916
The camera!

51
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:16,716
-Ooh, there were quite a few.

52
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:21,249
-Yeah I bet Inui's busy
counting them all up for us.

53
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:23,916
-There were 49
people watching us.

54
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:25,982
Compared to the last
two years, that's

55
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:28,282
a 1.75% percent increase.

56
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:30,082
-Oh.

57
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:31,916
-That's Inui for you.

58
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,382
-Hey, break is over.

59
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,749
There's not much time left
before the district finals.

60
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,516
Keep practicing,
and stay focused.

61
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:38,216
-Yes.

62
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:39,182
-Uh oh.

63
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:41,049
The team's starting
to heat up now.

64
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:41,916
-Guys, where's Ryoma.

65
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:42,816
Have you seen him?

66
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:44,249
-You know he works
in the library.

67
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:45,116
So he'll be late.

68
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:46,016
-Oh yeah.

69
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:46,649
That's right.

70
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:52,682
KENZO: Shunsuke, keep
watching them very carefully.

71
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:54,116
SHUNSUKE: All right, Kenzo, sir.

72
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:02,682
KIYOSUME: Wow.

73
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:04,049
-Huh?

74
00:04:04,082 --> 00:04:06,816
-There are many cuties on the
Seigaku girls' tennis team.

75
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,149
I wish I was a
student at Seigaku.

76
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,482
Hey, that girl is
totally my type.

77
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:18,149
-So, did you really buy this?

78
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:19,182
-Mhmm.

79
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:20,949
It's a tennis ball
attached to elastic.

80
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:23,149
The ball comes back
by itself, so I

81
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:26,016
can practice hitting my
shots without a partner

82
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,982
-Looks like they're having fun.

83
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:29,016
I envy them.

84
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:31,449
They seem so friendly
with each other.

85
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:33,616
If I didn't have to take
care of my little brothers,

86
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,516
I'd be able to
join the team, too.

87
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:38,416
-Hey, today is free play.

88
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:39,916
How'd you like to try your luck?

89
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,382
Give it a shot, Tomoka.

90
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,449
-Really?

91
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:44,949
Oh, it's coming back.

92
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:45,949
There.

93
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:46,949
-You're good.

94
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:48,449
-Whoa!

95
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:49,249
-Oh!

96
00:04:49,282 --> 00:04:50,082
You OK?

97
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:52,216
-[giggling]

98
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:52,749
-Huh?

99
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:53,649
-Huh?

100
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:55,216
-Hey, this is pretty cool.

101
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,816
-Snake shot, wow.

102
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:03,316
He's called Rupaido.

103
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:05,316
He used that boomerang
snake shot in the finals,

104
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:06,682
against Futomine.

105
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:08,182
-Hey, look over there.

106
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:10,316
It's Oishii co-captain,
and Kawamuar,

107
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:11,682
famous for his burning serve.

108
00:05:11,716 --> 00:05:12,216
-On fire.

109
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:14,016
-Ooh, great.

110
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,382
Well, no wonder
they're regulars.

111
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:20,816
-The schools playing
in the metropolitans

112
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:24,582
are finalized-- the always
present Hyoutei Academy;

113
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:28,716
Yamabuki Junior High, who's
player Senbuku has experience

114
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:33,549
at the nationals; and then the
Block Two runner up, Futomine

115
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:34,349
Junior High.

116
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:40,849
SHUNSUKE: Strange.

117
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,316
KENZO: What's wrong, Shunsuke?

118
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:44,382
-It's just that I don't
see the seventh grader who

119
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,316
played at the district matches.

120
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:49,082
It looks like the only ones
practicing on the tennis courts

121
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:52,349
right now are well known
members like Fuji, and Kikumaru.

122
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:53,516
KENZO: Let me see those.

123
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:54,649
-Whoa.

124
00:05:54,682 --> 00:05:56,382
-He's probably goofing
off, because he's not

125
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,582
interested in practice.

126
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:59,649
-He's not as dedicated
as you are, sir.

127
00:05:59,682 --> 00:06:00,216
KENZO: What?

128
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:02,416
SHUNSUKE: [gasp]

129
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:08,849
-Wow.

130
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:09,916
-Wonderful, Ryoma.

131
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:12,649
-Yeah, you're good.

132
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:17,416
-No wonder at Seigaku they
have a great seventh grader.

133
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,382
-[gasp]

134
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,116
-Oh!

135
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:25,249
-Hmm

136
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:25,882
-Hmm.

137
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:26,816
-Awesome.

138
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:27,982
-He just stands there.

139
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:33,816
-You're very close.

140
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:36,149
But if you put a little more
weight on your pivot foot,

141
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:39,282
your shot would be
even more powerful.

142
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,182
-Thanks for that tip.

143
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:42,616
-Huh?

144
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:43,549
Oh!

145
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:47,382
-[gasp]

146
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,849
Oh no.

147
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:51,182
-He must be out cold.

148
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:53,182
-Who is he?

149
00:06:53,216 --> 00:06:55,949
GIRL: Yamabuki Junior
High, Kyosumi Sengoku.

150
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:59,116
-Well, what should we do,
take him to the infirmary?

151
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:00,282
-Oh well.

152
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:01,882
-Hey, wait, Ryoma.

153
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,182
SHUNSUKE: Sir, sir, that's him!

154
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:05,282
-Oh, she's so cute!

155
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:05,782
-Huh?

156
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,149
Hmm.

157
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:08,549
[cracking]

158
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:09,882
-Waah!

159
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,316
[thud]

160
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:15,749
[moaning]

161
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:20,516
-Huh?

162
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:35,082
-That's the seventh grader who
played in the preliminaries.

163
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:36,482
-Yowie!

164
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:38,716
That's the seventh grader who
played in the preliminaries.

165
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,016
-Ryoma Echizen.

166
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:41,582
-Ryoma Echizen.

167
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:44,082
-Stop repeating
everything after me.

168
00:07:44,116 --> 00:07:45,482
Hey, look over there.

169
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:47,582
It looks like he
works in the library.

170
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:48,649
Now I get it.

171
00:07:48,682 --> 00:07:49,282
SHUNSUKE: Yeah?

172
00:07:49,316 --> 00:07:50,116
So what?

173
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:51,582
KENZO: You are such an idiot.

174
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:52,916
No, listen.

175
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:55,049
Usually, it's the silent person
in the class who helps out

176
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:58,016
in the library, also the
one who maintains his cool,

177
00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:00,649
and doesn't like to
hang out with friends.

178
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:02,982
-Oh, now I see.

179
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,416
-Quick, write that down.

180
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,016
That kind of data will
be crucial to the match.

181
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:08,649
-Really?

182
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:10,749
-He may be Seigaku's
secret weapon.

183
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,949
So we really should
check him out thoroughly.

184
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:13,849
-All right.

185
00:08:13,882 --> 00:08:15,249
-We big goal.

186
00:08:15,282 --> 00:08:17,149
And we mustn't let
ourselves forget it,

187
00:08:17,182 --> 00:08:18,849
not even for a single instant.

188
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:21,516
-Yes, I'll never
forget, Kenzo, sir.

189
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:24,816
-Remember what happened, and
how upset we we're at the time?

190
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:26,949
The other team members
treated us badly.

191
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:29,816
But this time we'll show them
how important we really are.

192
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,682
We made a vow about
this on the hill

193
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:33,616
during that magnificent sunset.

194
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,982
-You said treated us badly?

195
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,382
But they only cut us because
we goofed off so much

196
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,716
during the really
hard practices.

197
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:43,516
-Hey, stupid, I don't think that
was really a practice at all.

198
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,916
It was really bad.

199
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:46,482
I think it was a nightmare.

200
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:49,716
-But even so, you shouldn't have
got me involved in this affair.

201
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:50,816
-What did you say?

202
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:52,216
-Uh, nothing.

203
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:53,516
KENZO: Listen to me.

204
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:56,149
If we gather all kinds of
information about this team,

205
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:58,549
the one everybody thinks
will win at district finals,

206
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:00,582
our tennis team is
bound to want it.

207
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:02,582
But I won't give it
to them for free.

208
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:04,816
We'll show them how
important we really are.

209
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:09,516
-Hey, sorry for making you wait.

210
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,149
-No bother.

211
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:17,216
KENZO: That guy with Echizen
is Takeshi Momoshiro,

212
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:18,916
his doubles partner.

213
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:21,016
-We can get information
on both of them at once!

214
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:24,216
--[chuckling] We're
going to get them!

215
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,656
-I changed my grip size recently
from a number three to a four.

216
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:55,456
-Since you tend to hit so
hard, I think a number of four

217
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:56,656
suits you even better.

218
00:09:56,689 --> 00:09:57,422
TAKESHI: Right?

219
00:09:57,456 --> 00:09:58,389
RYOMA: How about tension?

220
00:09:58,422 --> 00:10:00,089
TAKESHI: I increased it to 80.

221
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:01,756
RYOMA: Your elbow
will take more shock.

222
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:03,722
TAKESHI: I'll keep training
to tone my muscles.

223
00:10:03,756 --> 00:10:05,889
-This conversation
is quite revealing.

224
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:07,189
-No, not really.

225
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:08,956
-[gasp] Are you sure?

226
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:11,456
-I'm not looking for
this kind of data.

227
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:15,256
I want information about their
humanity, what makes them tick.

228
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:17,122
In other words, the real truth.

229
00:10:17,156 --> 00:10:18,722
SHUNSUKE: The real truth?

230
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:21,022
-For example, what
are they eating?

231
00:10:21,056 --> 00:10:24,556
-Uh, double burgers with
a side of fries and Cola.

232
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,922
-That's got to be pretty
filling for the price,

233
00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:28,889
and they never get tired of it.

234
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:30,922
Seems like they're
regulars here.

235
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:32,422
That could be very important.

236
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:33,056
-Huh?

237
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:34,122
Very important?

238
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:35,622
What kind of truth is that?

239
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:37,322
-Think about it carefully.

240
00:10:37,356 --> 00:10:40,289
You see, every person has a
routine that they follow day

241
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:42,422
in and out, week after week.

242
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:44,522
Then something happens,
or something goes wrong,

243
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:46,122
and they'll have to
break that routine.

244
00:10:46,156 --> 00:10:47,156
-Oh, I see.

245
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,422
-Now if they order
something different,

246
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:50,389
or if they went to a
different restaurant, that

247
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,256
would mean something
was going to happen.

248
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:53,989
And we have to know about it.

249
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:55,422
So pay close attention.

250
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:56,622
Always be aware.

251
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,822
-Oh, great, sir.

252
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:58,989
You are so insightful.

253
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:00,556
-[chuckling]

254
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:01,722
TAKESHI: Hey, let's go.

255
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:02,222
-Right.

256
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:08,989
-Hmm.

257
00:11:09,022 --> 00:11:10,956
-[chuckling]

258
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,956
-These sneakers look great.

259
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:20,156
-Yeah.

260
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:21,722
But don't you think
they're a little expensive.

261
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:23,422
-I think they'll
give us a discount.

262
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:26,522
The Seigaku team
shops here regularly.

263
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:27,722
-This is Jupiter.

264
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:29,156
What's up, Space Orbiter?

265
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:29,722
-Jupiter?

266
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:30,389
Orbiter?

267
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:31,289
What are you suppo--

268
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:32,589
-They're code names, of course.

269
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:34,122
Can't you figure anything out?

270
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:35,289
-Why am I--

271
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:37,156
-Stop questioning
everything, and get to work.

272
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:37,656
-Whoa!

273
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:47,056
-I don't know about these.

274
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:48,222
Maybe if they had them in--

275
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:48,856
-Huh?

276
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:49,722
-Closer, come on.

277
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:50,456
Closer.

278
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:51,822
-[sigh] Hmm.

279
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,222
-Hey, these look cool.

280
00:11:58,256 --> 00:11:59,056
-Which ones?

281
00:11:59,089 --> 00:11:59,722
-These.

282
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:00,622
-They cost too much.

283
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:02,122
-But they're on sale now.

284
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:04,122
RYOMA: Hmm.

285
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,156
-Oh!

286
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:06,556
-Hey.

287
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:08,856
-Huh?

288
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:09,356
Huh?

289
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:13,056
-Oh no.

290
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:14,422
He spotted him.

291
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:16,156
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
look over here.

292
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:17,189
Hey, hey, hey, over here.

293
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:18,089
Over here.

294
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:20,389
-Huh?

295
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:21,289
Mm.

296
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:23,656
-Uh oh.

297
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:24,556
-Huh?

298
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:27,789
-[clearing throat] Uh.

299
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:34,389
-Well, oh, um,
[nervous laughter] Excuse me.

300
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:35,889
-[whistling]

301
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,189
-Oh, sir.

302
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:38,689
-Idiot, use code.

303
00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:41,256
Anyway, did you get what
they were talking about.

304
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:43,689
-Seigaku regulars are
good customers here.

305
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,289
And the shop is
having a discount sale

306
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:47,289
on shoes, shorts, and underwear.

307
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:50,689
-Uh, I don't want such
trivial information.

308
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:52,289
I'm definitely going
to need something

309
00:12:52,322 --> 00:12:53,589
with more impact than that.

310
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:54,989
-More impact?

311
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:57,489
-Something that will
influence the next match.

312
00:12:57,522 --> 00:12:59,822
Maybe if we could
find out about their--

313
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:00,989
RYOMA: Weak points, huh?

314
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:01,622
-Right.

315
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:02,789
Their weak points.

316
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:05,122
If we find out what
they are, our data

317
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:07,256
will become much more valuable.

318
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:07,756
Huh?

319
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:08,256
Wha?

320
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:16,489
I bought that ball I
showed you at this shop.

321
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:17,056
-Oh.

322
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,756
I want one, too.

323
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,656
-So, it seems like the two of
you have been spying on us.

324
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:24,589
That means both of you
have quite a bit a nerve.

325
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:25,356
-Uh oh.

326
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:25,889
Kenzo, sir?

327
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:26,389
-Mm.

328
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:32,189
-Oh, hey, look.

329
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:34,022
It's Ryoma and Momoshiro.

330
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:35,422
-Hey.

331
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:37,689
-(THINKING) That's the pretty
girl I saw a little while ago.

332
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:39,089
-Are these friends of yours?

333
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:39,922
-Actually, they're--

334
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:44,422
-[laughing]

335
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:51,722
-Uh, sir, what's
the matter with you?

336
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:53,022
-It all right now.

337
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:56,189
If you say you really want
it, I'll give you a chance.

338
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:56,922
-Huh?

339
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:58,122
-All right, then.

340
00:13:58,156 --> 00:14:00,222
Let's play a game.

341
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,489
-Huh?

342
00:14:01,522 --> 00:14:02,189
-I don't know.

343
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:03,389
They're kind of weird.

344
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:04,522
-You may be right.

345
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:06,622
Perhaps we shouldn't
get involved with them.

346
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:08,556
KENZO: Hey, you backing out?

347
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:09,522
-Hmm.

348
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:13,456
[music playing]

349
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,422
-Oh, Kenzo, how did
it turn out like this?

350
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:28,122
-Shut up.

351
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:29,756
We can't help it now.

352
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:32,122
-Even if there are pretty
girls here to watch our game,

353
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:34,722
there's a huge difference
between Seigaku's regulars

354
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:35,356
and us.

355
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:36,422
-Will you shut up?

356
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:37,822
We'll use the
chance to find some

357
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:39,822
of the weak points of
their doubles game.

358
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:40,922
Up or down?

359
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:42,056
-I'll take up.

360
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,422
-You sure this is going
to be OK, Kenzo, sir?

361
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:45,889
-Don't worry about it, OK.

362
00:14:45,922 --> 00:14:48,622
If we get to serve first, we'll
have a chance to win this game.

363
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:55,056

Great.
