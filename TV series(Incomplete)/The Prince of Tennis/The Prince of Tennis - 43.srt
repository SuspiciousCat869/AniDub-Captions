1
00:00:07,768 --> 00:00:08,702
ANNOUNCER: 30-Love.

2
00:00:08,735 --> 00:00:09,768
-I can't believe it.

3
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,368
I couldn't even see
the path of the ball.

4
00:00:14,735 --> 00:00:15,502
ANNOUNCER: 40-Love.

5
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:16,235
-All right, Yamabuki!

6
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:17,202
-He's got that smashed!

7
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:18,468
-We won!

8
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:19,035
-Sengoku!

9
00:00:19,068 --> 00:00:20,835
Sengoku!

10
00:00:20,868 --> 00:00:23,335
-Man, Sengoku got to
game point quickly.

11
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:26,568
-It goes to show how well
he can rattle his opponent.

12
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:28,702
-Well, this should be it.

13
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:31,202
Sengoku used his Tiger Cannon.

14
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:34,535
Momoshiro, it's over.

15
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:39,035
[theme music]

16
00:01:56,982 --> 00:01:59,249
-All right, lackey
Sengoku, let's

17
00:01:59,282 --> 00:02:02,249
see what a junior all-star
tough guy is made of.

18
00:02:02,282 --> 00:02:06,349
-By the way, it's Lucky
Sengoku, not lackey Sengoku.

19
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:07,949
And for the record,
I don't really

20
00:02:07,982 --> 00:02:09,849
think your dunk smash
is that impressive.

21
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,616
-All right.

22
00:02:24,182 --> 00:02:26,349
-We will begin
number three singles.

23
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:32,149
It's a one set match, service
to Seigaku's Momoshiro.

24
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:32,682
-Hm.

25
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:51,716
-Hey, know what?

26
00:02:51,749 --> 00:02:53,882
I'm going to make you sorry
you gave me the starting serve.

27
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:01,049
-You see that?

28
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:02,282
-Hey, it's Momoshiro's--

29
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,149
-Bullet serve!

30
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,449
-He's a big hitter.

31
00:03:13,749 --> 00:03:14,716
SENGOKU (VOICEOVER): Hm.

32
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:16,216
That's a pretty solid shot.

33
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,782
-This is gonna be a tough one.

34
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:23,749
Go!

35
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:25,616
Momoshiro, yeah!

36
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:26,849
-What's with this guy?

37
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:29,549
-It seems he's as
good as Sengoku.

38
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:31,082
-It's much worse than that.

39
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:34,116
It feels like he's got Sengoku
playing on the defense.

40
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:35,249
-Uh-huh.

41
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:39,716
I see this is your style
of tennis, Momoshiro.

42
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:41,549
[shout]

43
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:44,049
-Why is Momo rushing
the net like that?

44
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:45,016
-Go!

45
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:46,449
SENGOKU (VOICEOVER):
Then I'll just

46
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:48,116
have to make a passing
shot to the left.

47
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:53,716
-Huh?

48
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:56,616
Hey, there!

49
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:59,682
Looks like you almost had
a winner there, buddy!

50
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:00,882
-This guy.

51
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,482
He's got some amazing speed.

52
00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:12,416
-He jumped for it!

53
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:13,616
-Then that must mean--

54
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:24,382
-It's good!

55
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:28,449
Momo's dunk smash is awesome!

56
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:29,363
-Yeah!

57
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,216
-Amazing.

58
00:04:36,249 --> 00:04:38,016
-Was that his dunk smash?

59
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:39,949
-It had to be.

60
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:41,282
-All right, he did it!

61
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:43,749
-Momo's been completely
dominant from the start.

62
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:44,582
-Yeah!

63
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:47,816
-Come and get me!

64
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:48,682
Take that!

65
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:55,516
-That Momo.

66
00:04:55,549 --> 00:04:57,282
It actually looks
like he might be

67
00:04:57,316 --> 00:05:00,216
able to take out a
junior all-star player.

68
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:02,816
When did he become such
a good player, anyway?

69
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:05,182
Well, Tezuka, I guess
yesterday's practice

70
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:06,849
wasn't a waste of
time after all.

71
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:08,216
-That's right.

72
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:12,682
Momoshiro's aggressive style
of play is his biggest weapon.

73
00:05:12,716 --> 00:05:14,916
-Hey, Banji, better watch out.

74
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:16,316
Your boys will
have to work mighty

75
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,716
hard to shut down Momoshiro.

76
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:24,482
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER): Hm.

77
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:25,916
Why is he so calm?

78
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:30,782
MOMOSHIRO (VOICEOVER): I
can't let my guard down.

79
00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:32,549
The pressure's killing me.

80
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,749
I can feel him
breathing down my neck.

81
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:40,082
It's just like when Tezuka
neutralized all my attacks.

82
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:43,316
But Sengoku's as
cutthroat as I am.

83
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:47,082
This match will be mine.

84
00:05:50,582 --> 00:05:51,049
-Huh?

85
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:55,782
-That shot's too high!

86
00:05:55,816 --> 00:05:58,416
It's going out!

87
00:05:58,449 --> 00:05:59,916
MOMOSHIRO (VOICEOVER):
That's a lob!

88
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:01,749
With a slice spin!

89
00:06:01,782 --> 00:06:03,349
It's going to come down fast!

90
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:11,549
I knew I couldn't
let my guard down!

91
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:12,049
-Huh?

92
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:20,516
Huh?

93
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:24,949
-Huh?

94
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:25,882
Dunk smash?

95
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,182
-But that's Momo's shot.

96
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:29,616
-No way.

97
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:30,316
ANNOUNCER: 40-15.

98
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:37,849
BOY: He's pretty good.

99
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:39,682
He faked Momo out.

100
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:41,249
He pretended to
defend the lob, but he

101
00:06:41,282 --> 00:06:43,482
was setting up for
that dunk smash.

102
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:44,716
-Wow.

103
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:48,049
I'm a lucky guy to get such
a clean shot off of you.

104
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:51,149
-You wouldn't think that a
top ranked player like Sengoku

105
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:54,382
would have to resort to such
cheap tricks, would you?

106
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,116
-Tennis is a sport where
the mental side of the game

107
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:59,216
can have a huge impact.

108
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:03,216
I wonder if Momoshiro will
be affected psychologically

109
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:08,316
after his opponent used his
signature shot against him?

110
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:09,249
-Excuse me.

111
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:10,449
I call a time out.

112
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:13,282
The strings on this practice
racket are too loose.

113
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:14,516
I'm going to change my stick.

114
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,316
Hm.

115
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:23,082
Much better.

116
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:27,549
And now it's time to use
my game racket, Omoshiro.

117
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:29,282
-It's not Omoshiro.

118
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:32,349
-But it sounds so much better.

119
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:36,216
[cheering]

120
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:41,116
-Come on!

121
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:42,716
Just do it, Momo!

122
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:44,282
ANNOUNCER: Game to Yamabuki.

123
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:45,382
One game to Love.

124
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,849
-A big break for me.

125
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:49,216
Just call me lucky.

126
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:50,649
ANNOUNCER: Change sides.

127
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:52,016
-That's impossible!

128
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:53,782
-But he led most of this game.

129
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:57,949
-It just went from 40-Love to
break point in no time at all.

130
00:07:57,982 --> 00:07:59,082
-That fool.

131
00:07:59,116 --> 00:08:01,349
He's really letting him
mess with this head.

132
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:02,216
-Hm.

133
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,549
Not so bad.

134
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:07,482
[humming]

135
00:08:07,516 --> 00:08:08,782
-I knew it.

136
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:11,116
It's all been downhill for him
ever since that dunk smash.

137
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:19,649
-This is looking good for us.

138
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:22,482
-Sengoku's got
gamemanship down for sure.

139
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:23,249
-Sengoku!

140
00:08:23,282 --> 00:08:24,349
Sengoku!

141
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:25,182
Sengoku!

142
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:27,549
-Sengoku's looking really good.

143
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:29,282
-It certainly is
clear why he was

144
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:31,716
named a junior all-star player.

145
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:34,082
-Well, I guess it just proves
that he's a notch or two

146
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:35,916
above the other players.

147
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,216
-Huh?

148
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:37,849
-Yikes.

149
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:39,182
Nanzabiro's here.

150
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:39,849
-No.

151
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:41,416
My name is Nanjiro.

152
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:45,382
But I think you can call
me anything you want to.

153
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,682
-Hey!

154
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:48,582
Just who do you think you
are, talking to me like that?

155
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:49,982
-Hey, Nanjiro.

156
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:54,149
So what can you tell us about
Banda, the coach from Yamabuki?

157
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:57,149
Well, from what I heard, you
were a player at Seigaku.

158
00:08:57,182 --> 00:08:58,349
Am I right?

159
00:08:58,382 --> 00:09:01,016
Banda coached for a school
that wasn't well known.

160
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:04,182
A school whose team defeated
Seigaku in the metropolitan

161
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:05,649
matches.

162
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:08,182
But that's not all, is it?

163
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:10,782
It seems to me that both
you and Coach Ryuzaki

164
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,016
are awfully worried about
the way this guy coaches.

165
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:16,682
-Aw, it's not that bad.

166
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:19,716
Back then, we were the
number one seated team.

167
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:23,316
Our first opponents were
that old grandpa's boys,

168
00:09:23,349 --> 00:09:25,049
Kuwanomi Junior High.

169
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:27,749
They were a team that
wasn't even on the radar.

170
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:33,082
However, that match
took unexpected turns.

171
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:34,782
It was not a good
day for Seigaku.

172
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:41,816
ANNOUNCER: Out!

173
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,816
Game and match to Kuwanomi.

174
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:44,316
-No!

175
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:50,049
ANNOUNCER: Game and
match to Kuwanomi.

176
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:53,949
-No way.

177
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:01,816
-Game and match to Seigaku.

178
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:03,482
Score of six games to Love.

179
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:05,916
NANJIRO: Of course, it was
a piece of cake for me.

180
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:07,782
But the rest of the
guys got flustered

181
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,449
by that geezer's smug grin.

182
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:12,016
It was bad.

183
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,982
Our team got killed
in that tournament.

184
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:20,849
To make a long
story short, Banda's

185
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:23,549
the king of gamesmanship.

186
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,782
It's amazing that we missed it.

187
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:28,249
Especially the old hag.

188
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:40,349
-So, now, you going to make
this interesting, Omoshiro?

189
00:10:52,996 --> 00:10:54,562
Here I go, Omoshiro.

190
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:02,396
BOY: Look how high his toss is.

191
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:08,796
I can't believe he gets so high.

192
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:09,796
-No way!

193
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:12,229
He's going to hit
it from up there?

194
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:21,596
-Huh?

195
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:22,962
ANNOUNCER: 15-Love.

196
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:24,529
-How'd he serve like that?

197
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:28,362
-Yup.

198
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,929
I'm on a roll.

199
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:33,229
-It's like, his serve is
absolutely unreturnable.

200
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:36,429
-That is Sengoku's secret
weapon, the Tiger Cannon.

201
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,129
-Tiger Cannon?

202
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:41,429
-It is a shot that utilizes his
entire frame to the fullest,

203
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:44,829
allowing him to hammer the
ball from a high vantage point.

204
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:50,596
By doing that, he lands
the ball both close

205
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:53,029
to and in the center.

206
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,062
-30-Love.

207
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:55,162
-I can't believe it.

208
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:56,929
I couldn't even see
the path of the ball.

209
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:01,829
ANNOUNCER: 40-Love!

210
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:03,196
-All right, Yamabuki!

211
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:04,829
We won!

212
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:05,896
-Sengoku!

213
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:06,962
Sengoku!

214
00:12:06,996 --> 00:12:09,696
-Man, Sengoku got to
game point quickly.

215
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,696
-It goes to show how well
he can rattle his opponent.

216
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:14,962
Well this should be it.

217
00:12:14,996 --> 00:12:17,229
Sengoku used his Tiger Cannon.

218
00:12:17,262 --> 00:12:19,962
Momoshiro, it's over.

219
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,529
-He's not too bad.

220
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:24,696
First he gets Momo off balance
by getting inside his head,

221
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:28,929
and then he messes him up with
that treacherous serve he uses.

222
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:30,262
Momo better watch out.

223
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:33,496
It looks like that guy's got
more tricks up his sleeve.

224
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:36,596
-It's amazing how he gets
his opponents all worked up,

225
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:38,862
and then gets them
to play his game.

226
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:43,896
So that's the Yamabuki
adviser Banda's tennis style.

227
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,696
-We're not done.

228
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:46,162
Let's not give up just yet.

229
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:50,896
Although that orange haired
boy of theirs is pretty good.

230
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:53,262
-Well, time of wrap this up.

231
00:12:58,096 --> 00:12:59,529
BOY: He jumped!

232
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:00,529
BOY: The Tiger Cannon!

233
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:13,729
-Huh?

234
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:14,196
-Mm.

235
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:17,562
-40-15.

236
00:13:23,162 --> 00:13:24,629
-Not too shabby, huh?

237
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:27,062
Our little trickster did good.

238
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:28,729
-How did he return that?

239
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:31,296
-He hit a winner off
Sengoku's Tiger Shot.

240
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:32,329
-No way!

241
00:13:32,362 --> 00:13:33,762
It's gotta be a fluke for sure.

242
00:13:46,662 --> 00:13:47,329
ANNOUNCER: 40-30.

243
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,396
-Wow, he completely
saw that one coming.

244
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:54,029
Man, this could mean trouble.

245
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:55,062
-You're absolutely right.

246
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:03,096
-Come on, Momo.

247
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:05,529
You can win this thing!

248
00:14:05,562 --> 00:14:06,896
-Hey, Echizen.

249
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,162
Do me a favor and get
me my game racket.

250
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:09,962
-What?

251
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:12,262
You've got to be kidding me.

252
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:14,162
-Come on, I was just having fun.

253
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:15,096
-Why, you--

254
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:23,996
-Whoa!

255
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:29,929
-Wow.

256
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:31,662
-He's incredible.

257
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:33,962
-Yeah, this is really
becoming a slugfest.

258
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:36,762
-Seigaku's guy is awesome.

259
00:14:36,796 --> 00:14:39,029
-Take this!

260
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:42,729
-Tie game, with Yamabuki,
Sengoku at three games each.

261
00:14:42,762 --> 00:14:43,896
-It's all tied up again.

262
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:45,162
-Yeah.

263
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:46,596
Ever since they took that
break, they've pretty much

264
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:48,829
been keeping up with each
other the whole game.

265
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:52,496
-Even so, Momo's still
sweating buckets out there.

266
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:54,496
SENGOKU (VOICEOVER): This
guy is mentally tough.

267
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,529
I thought for sure he'd
crumble after I aced him

268
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,396
with that dunk smash.

269
00:15:00,962 --> 00:15:01,429
-Huh?

270
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,362
-Uh-oh.

271
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:08,962
Our good friend here looks
like he might be hurt.

272
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:11,296
-Huh?

273
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:12,462
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER): Oh, no.

274
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:15,262
He's having cramps
in his left leg.

275
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:17,862
by compensating for
his injured right foot,

276
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:21,029
he's putting way too much
of a strain on his left leg.

277
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:31,262
Hm?

278
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:34,829
Although this could just be
momentary, due to fatigue,

279
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:36,796
Momo, the fact remains
that this still

280
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,629
puts you at a
serious disadvantage.

281
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:42,596
HORIO: Come on, Momo!

282
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:45,229
KATSUO: One more shot!

283
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:46,029
-Oh yeah.

284
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:53,696
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER): Still,
for Momo's leg to cramp up

285
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:58,162
like that, this has got to
be one tough match for him.

286
00:15:58,196 --> 00:16:03,329
Sengoku didn't get this
far just by being lucky.

287
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:07,329
It appears he has the
skills to back it up.

288
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:10,562
Besides which, he seems to
have the motion tracking skills

289
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,529
that Momo lacks.

290
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:14,296
-Motion tracking skills?

291
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:17,529
-It's the ability to follow
moving objects, right, Inui?

292
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:20,029
-I've heard that Ryoma and
Kikumaru have good motion

293
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,796
tracking skills.

294
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:25,762
-They do, but Sengoku
can put them to shame.

295
00:16:25,796 --> 00:16:27,529
-Huh?

296
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:29,529
SHUSHUKE: Momo may look
good on those returns,

297
00:16:29,562 --> 00:16:31,862
but Sengoku's more
accurate and efficient.

298
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:34,796
It just goes to show you how
well he's able to see the ball

299
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:36,496
and read its path.

300
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,896
-I can barely even keep
my eyes on the ball

301
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:40,162
without it making me dizzy.

302
00:16:40,196 --> 00:16:41,662
-Ah huh.

303
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:42,796
-You got it.

304
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:44,896
I'm sure that even
Momoshiro's hardest shots

305
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:46,696
look slow to that guy, huh?

306
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:47,662
-Wow.

307
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:49,896
-So then what should
he do now, huh?

308
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:51,496
-There's not much
he can really do.

309
00:16:58,996 --> 00:17:00,829
-Five games to three.

310
00:17:00,862 --> 00:17:02,396
Yamabuki leads.

311
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:03,529
-Hey, look.

312
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:08,396
Sengoku's one point away
from winning the game!

313
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:10,029
Akutsu?

314
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,996
-Yes, indeed, my friends.

315
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:16,362
It seems that Sengoku
can do it all.

316
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:17,262
-Ow.

317
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:18,896
This is not good.

318
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:21,062
Really hurts.

319
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:22,696
-Momo?

320
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:23,529
-Huh?

321
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:24,229
Trust me.

322
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:26,596
It'll be fine, Coach.

323
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,429
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER): Momo.

324
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:32,196
MOMOSHIRO (VOICEOVER): It's
as if he can see into my mind.

325
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:35,296
And yet I don't have a
clue what he's up to.

326
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:37,629
I went all want to put
this game away quickly,

327
00:17:37,662 --> 00:17:38,862
but look what happened.

328
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,162
-He's a tough opponent.

329
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:49,396
-Ow.

330
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:51,796
-My, my.

331
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:52,929
-Hey, look at that.

332
00:17:52,962 --> 00:17:55,762
-That guy's left leg's
beginning to cramp.

333
00:17:55,796 --> 00:17:56,262
-Beginning?

334
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,296
-Are those cramps?

335
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:05,729
-Now they know.

336
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:07,729
SENGOKU (VOICEOVER):
Boy, am I lucky.

337
00:18:07,762 --> 00:18:10,396
I really shouldn't revel in
other people's misfortunes,

338
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:12,396
though.

339
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:13,096
HORIO: No way!

340
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:14,962
A cramp in Momo's leg?

341
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:18,396
KACHIRO: Oh, no.

342
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:20,062
-It looks bad.

343
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:22,162
I doubt he can play a
decent match like that.

344
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:23,529
SENGOKU (VOICEOVER):
So he's been

345
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,229
playing on that leg all along?

346
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:33,796
-Whoa.

347
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:34,696
-A devastating return!

348
00:18:37,729 --> 00:18:39,562
-I admire your
determination, Momoshiro.

349
00:18:55,562 --> 00:18:56,096
-Momoshiro.

350
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:59,196
You are strong.

351
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:03,029
However, by compensating
for that right leg so much,

352
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:07,696
you prevent yourself from
using your full strength.

353
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,829
Your sprain healed over
a month ago, didn't it?

354
00:19:18,662 --> 00:19:20,762
-I can't believe he's
still gonna play.

355
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:21,929
-Crazy.

356
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:23,829
-Yeah, the poor guy can
barely stand up now.

357
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:24,962
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): Come on.

358
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:25,996
Give it your all, Momo.

359
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,229
-All right, then.

360
00:19:32,262 --> 00:19:33,662
Come and get me, Momoshiro.

361
00:19:41,862 --> 00:19:43,662
-He jumped up off his right leg!

362
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:49,162
NANJIRO (VOICEOVER): Yes.

363
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:51,329
MOMOSHIRO (VOICEOVER):
You're right, Captain Tezuka.

364
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:56,296
SENGOKU (VOICEOVER): He's
gonna step into the ball.

365
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:00,262
No, he's not.

366
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:02,529
The ball's just
sitting on the strings.

367
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:03,729
MOMOSHIRO (VOICEOVER): I am--

368
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:10,529
-It can't be!

369
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:16,029
MOMOSHIRO (VOICEOVER):
I am tough!

370
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:27,398
[theme music]

371
00:20:56,198 --> 00:20:57,598
-Hey, everyone.

372
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:58,498
Thanks for waiting.

373
00:20:58,532 --> 00:20:59,932
It's me, Momo.

374
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:01,965
I'm not the most
serious guy around,

375
00:21:01,998 --> 00:21:05,532
but Sengoku's no better.

376
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,498
I know I shouldn't
take him lightly.

377
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,965
No, I shouldn't.

378
00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:10,798
This guy is really strong.

379
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:12,732
I don't know how
long my leg'll last,

380
00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:16,932
but I'm gonna give
everything I've got.

381
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:19,365
Next on "The Prince
of Tennis," Jacknife.

382
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:22,232
Guess I just gotta score big.
