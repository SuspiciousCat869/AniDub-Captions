1
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:16,324
-There's no way he's going
to beat a senior team player.

2
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:17,291
No way.

3
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:19,091
Not a chance that's
gonna happen.

4
00:00:26,949 --> 00:01:24,533
[theme music]

5
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:42,580
-Echizen's been
awesome up until now,

6
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:45,013
and he's gone up against
some pretty good players.

7
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:47,446
But he will not be able to
compete at this level for long.

8
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,680
-Why not?

9
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:50,980
He was beating that quitter
Momoshiro the other day.

10
00:01:51,013 --> 00:01:54,080
-That doesn't count, Momoshiro
had a sprained ankle.

11
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:56,046
If he hadn't been hurt,
he could've won easy.

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,646
All the top players are
better than Echizen.

13
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,780
He doesn't stand a chance
around the regulars,

14
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:02,413
no matter how hard he tries.

15
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:05,613
-But I'm rooting for
him, and so is Katsuo.

16
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:08,913
All the seventh graders look
up to Ryoma around here.

17
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:10,313
-Hey, here he comes now.

18
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:16,746
-Don't let the pressure
get to you, Ryoma!

19
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,080
-You can beat those guys!

20
00:02:18,113 --> 00:02:19,546
We know you can!

21
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:25,946
-Hey, newbies.

22
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,380
-Yes?

23
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,346
-You're bothering me.

24
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:28,846
Get.

25
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,980
-Yes!

26
00:02:30,013 --> 00:02:32,946
-We're out of here.

27
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,046
-Hey.

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,546
-What?

29
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,780
-I want to be left alone,
so get out of here.

30
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:43,546
-Sure.

31
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,580
I'll be going.

32
00:02:45,613 --> 00:02:46,913
What a creepy guy.

33
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,046
[heavy breathing]

34
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,880
-That was scary.

35
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:56,913
That was Kaoru
Kaidoh, wasn't it?

36
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:57,913
-Yeah.

37
00:02:57,946 --> 00:02:59,113
I think he's going
to play Echizen

38
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,013
in bracket D of the
upcoming ranking tournament.

39
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,146
-Bracket D?

40
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,980
Oh, bracket D. There's his same.

41
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:09,013
-What is a ranking
tournament, anyway?

42
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:11,813
-Are you trying to be the
school's new laughingstock?

43
00:03:11,846 --> 00:03:14,413
I can't believe I have
to explain this to you.

44
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:15,413
Listen up.

45
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,180
Ranking tournaments
are held monthly

46
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:19,080
to select the top
players from among all

47
00:03:19,113 --> 00:03:20,780
the eighth and ninth
grade students.

48
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:23,546
There are four brackets,
but only the top two players

49
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,513
from each bracket get
to play on the team.

50
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:27,480
Now, do you get it?

51
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:30,013
-Wow, Ryoma has his
work cut out for him.

52
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:30,713
-Yeah.

53
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:31,880
This really looks tough.

54
00:03:31,913 --> 00:03:32,946
-And that's not all.

55
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,646
Winners get something
you'll never have.

56
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,913
One of those.

57
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:37,646
A Seigaku team jacket.

58
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,580
What could be cooler than that?

59
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:42,580
-I don't know about tennis
fashion, but you seem to.

60
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:45,880
-Don't forget, I already have
two years of tennis experience.

61
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:48,313
Maybe one day I'll be good
enough to make the team.

62
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:51,880
And then, mark my words,
I'll have a jacket of my own.

63
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:53,713
-You're about to trip.

64
00:03:53,746 --> 00:03:54,613
-Oh!

65
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:55,546
Heh.

66
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,213
I meant to do that.

67
00:03:57,246 --> 00:03:59,213
-Hey, you three over there.

68
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:01,413
Stop that fooling around,
and help us out here

69
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:02,580
by putting up the nets.

70
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:03,080
-Right.

71
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:14,046
-Oh, I wish I was better.

72
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,646
Like Ryoma.

73
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:21,280
Oh, I'll never be
as good as him.

74
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:22,613
Ah!

75
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:23,913
Ryoma!

76
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:26,880
-Bend your knees, keep
your elbows straight.

77
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:27,746
-Huh?

78
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,980
And other tips?

79
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:31,513
-Your shoulders are too
open, your hair is too long,

80
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:33,013
stand firmer.

81
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:34,546
-Oh.

82
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,746
Oh.

83
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,713
-Oh my gosh!

84
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:38,180
Oh my gosh!

85
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:38,680
-Hurry!

86
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:39,746
Hurry!

87
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,113
The ranking tournament
is about to start!

88
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:43,013
-Hey, do you guys know
who Tezuka's playing?

89
00:04:43,046 --> 00:04:44,646
-No idea, but I
heard they're gonna

90
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,980
let a seventh grader play!

91
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:46,480
-No way!

92
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:47,280
Really?

93
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:48,480
GIRL: He must be something.

94
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:49,446
GIRL: Who is he?

95
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
-My Ryoma.

96
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:52,613
My hero.

97
00:04:52,646 --> 00:04:54,013
-Hey, what's the big idea?

98
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:55,346
-Calm down, Tomoka.

99
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,146
-What are you standing
around here for?

100
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,980
-Uh--

101
00:04:58,013 --> 00:04:58,880
-We have to go cheer on Ryoma!

102
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:02,013
-Look.

103
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:04,046
It's him.

104
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,680
-Kinda short, isn't he?

105
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:06,746
-He don't look so tough.

106
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,546
-Echizen!

107
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,746
Your match is up.

108
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,746
-If you lose, I might
be traumatized for life.

109
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,780
-This is it.

110
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:18,280
Even the older
players are watching

111
00:05:18,313 --> 00:05:19,513
to see what's going to happen.

112
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:20,280
[hiss]

113
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:21,546
-Huh?

114
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,180
-Move aside or be stomped.

115
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:24,513
-Uh, sure thing, Mr. Kaidoh.

116
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:25,580
We're moving now.

117
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:35,746
-What's Kaidoh doing here?

118
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,980
His match isn't scheduled
until much later.

119
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:40,180
-Yeah, but it looks like
he's already in battle mode.

120
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,713
[hiss]

121
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:00,546
[hiss]

122
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:06,146
-The other players
also look ready.

123
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:12,513
-Inui, you're in bracket
D too, aren't you?

124
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:15,013
How can you look
so calm right now?

125
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:16,546
This is only my game face.

126
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:30,013
-Today's ranking tournament is
going to be really exciting.

127
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:30,513
Let's go.

128
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:35,813
-Oh.

129
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,980
ANNOUNCER: Game, Echizen.

130
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:54,046
He leads three games to love.

131
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,046
-Keep it up, Ryoma!

132
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,546
That's the way to go!

133
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,546
-Chill out!

134
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,013
Echizen's got this one sewn up.

135
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:00,713
Huh?

136
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:02,013
Hey, where's Kachiro?

137
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:06,480
-He was just here a minute ago.

138
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:07,480
-Wow.

139
00:07:07,513 --> 00:07:11,446
Oishi's really on fire.

140
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,446
Kikumaru's not
doing bad, either.

141
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,446
Seems like all the
regular team members

142
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,580
are winning in straight sets.

143
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:20,546
-Oh, Ryoma!

144
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,513
Ryoma!

145
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:22,513
Ryoma!

146
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:23,480
Ryoma!

147
00:07:23,513 --> 00:07:24,946
Ryoma!

148
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,880
-Ryoma!

149
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,880
Oh, you're so cool!

150
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:31,280
-Boy, those girls
sure are wild for him.

151
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:44,113
-Worried about our
little Echizen?

152
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:44,646
-No.

153
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,280
Not really.

154
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,246
ANNOUNCER: Game, set,
and match to Echizen.

155
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,180
Six games to love.

156
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:00,080
-Ryoma!

157
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:00,580
Ryoma!

158
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,146
Ryoma!

159
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,113
-My goodness.

160
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:03,380
Sounds like she
needs medical help.

161
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:05,246
-Oh, hi, Miss Shiba.

162
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,713
-I see Ryoma's doing well.

163
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:09,413
He hasn't lost any games yet,
so it's been easy for him.

164
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:10,546
Tougher matches lie ahead.

165
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,613
-He doesn't look worried to me.

166
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:13,980
Look at him over there.

167
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:17,546
So calm, cool, and collected.

168
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,913
It's almost like he's at peace.

169
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:32,146
-Your game against Kaidoh is
the last match of the day,

170
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,613
and I for one hope you
beat him into the ground.

171
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:37,480
-There's no way he's going
to beat a senior team player.

172
00:08:37,513 --> 00:08:38,446
No way.

173
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,413
Not a chance that's
going to happen.

174
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:41,280
-Huh?

175
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,280
What's wrong?

176
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,513
-I didn't mean to
make you anxious.

177
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:45,013
-No.

178
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:46,080
Just hungry.

179
00:08:46,113 --> 00:08:47,280
-Huh?

180
00:08:47,313 --> 00:08:50,246
-Now you've got my stomach
all tied up in knots.

181
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,746
Urgh.

182
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,546
-Ow!

183
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,213
-Hi.

184
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:12,546
Ryoma Echizen, bracket
D. Six games to love.

185
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,346
-Got it.

186
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,658
OK.

187
00:09:17,113 --> 00:09:18,413
[chuckling]

188
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,326
-Fantastic.

189
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,445
Unbelievable.

190
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,645
Amazing.

191
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,012
Ryoma just keeps winning.

192
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:26,679
But before, you said
Ryoma couldn't beat anyone

193
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:27,912
on the team.

194
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:29,712
-I only meant the regulars.

195
00:09:29,745 --> 00:09:33,112
Maybe if, you know, Ryoma
keeps playing this well,

196
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:36,412
he might win a game
against Kaidoh.

197
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:39,545
Hey, Kachiro, we've been
looking all over for you.

198
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,912
-I think you better
check your face, Kachiro.

199
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:42,945
-Aw, it's nothing.

200
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:45,279
A tennis ball hit
me right in my eye.

201
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:47,179
Anyway, check out
this tape I shot.

202
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,512
You gotta see it.

203
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:51,545
It's footage of Ryoma's
next opponent in action.

204
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:52,279
That's right.

205
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:53,512
It's Kaidoh.

206
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:56,612
-You shot Kaidoh
without him knowing?

207
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:57,779
-That's great!

208
00:09:57,812 --> 00:09:59,345
We missed his match
'cause we were

209
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,279
busy watching Ryoma's easy win.

210
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:02,745
-So that's why you were gone.

211
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:04,479
We didn't know where
you went off to.

212
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:05,779
-Anyway, you've gotta see this.

213
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:07,212
He's something else.

214
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:08,145
RYOMA: Yeah.

215
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:10,279
He's strong and
fast on the court.

216
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:15,679
-Why, Ryoma, I've never heard
you talk like that before.

217
00:10:15,712 --> 00:10:17,979
-Man, these top
pros are incredible.

218
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:19,145
-Not that, Ryoma.

219
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:20,245
This.

220
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,479
I risked my eye so I
could record it for you.

221
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:25,945
-Huh?

222
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,579
Hey, Echizen, where you going?

223
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:28,645
-Ryoma!

224
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,745
-Man, I hate it
when he's like that.

225
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,179
-We'll just have to watch
the tape without him.

226
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:35,679
Showtime.

227
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,650
-What's he doing?

228
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:53,883
What kind of shot is that?

229
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:09,316
-Inui?

230
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:10,449
-You can go to lunch now.

231
00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:11,549
I'll take over.

232
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:12,282
-Great.

233
00:11:12,316 --> 00:11:14,749
How's it going?

234
00:11:14,782 --> 00:11:15,616
-I am winning.

235
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,382
No big surprise about that.

236
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,616
But that seventh grader
hasn't lost a game yet.

237
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:21,149
-But you'll know
how to beat him when

238
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:23,282
he goes up against you, right?

239
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,316
-It's possible.

240
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:26,216
-You and your
troublesome notebook.

241
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:27,216
I hate it.

242
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:28,149
-He's the one
who's going to have

243
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:29,616
trouble with his
next opponent.

244
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:30,482
-One of the regulars.

245
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:31,449
[hiss]

246
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,449
-Ah, Kaidoh.

247
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:34,882
You're looking cheerful
as ever, I see.

248
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,749
-You trying to pick
a fight with me?

249
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,816
-What's he doing?

250
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:44,349
-I've never seen anyone
play like that before.

251
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:47,882
-Kaidoh's playing style is very
unorthodox and totally unique.

252
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,282
I guess that's why everyone
calls him the viper.

253
00:11:50,316 --> 00:11:51,082
-Viper?

254
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:52,149
Odd nickname.

255
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:53,216
-It sure is.

256
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:56,816
But then again,
he's a very odd guy.

257
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:57,582
-Yikes!

258
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:58,949
He's looking right at us!

259
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:04,349
-What an incredible serve.

260
00:12:04,382 --> 00:12:06,649
There's no way Echizen's
gonna beat that guy.

261
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:07,516
It's impossible.

262
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:08,949
No way.

263
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:09,716
-I don't know.

264
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:10,849
-Huh?

265
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:12,716
-I think Ryoma can win
if he plays his best.

266
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:13,749
-You're crazy.

267
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:15,482
He's way too fast and
strong for Echizen.

268
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:18,249
-Ryoma's not an ordinary
player, you know.

269
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:20,416
I think he can beat him!

270
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,416
-Tomo always makes
me do everything.

271
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:23,616
She's so bossy.

272
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:27,082
Ryoma?

273
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:39,449
-Momo's overhead
smash is awesome.

274
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:43,416
-Match to Momoshiro,
six games to love.

275
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,282
-Mm, Momo's ankle sprain
appears to have fully healed.

276
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:47,782
-I didn't think
he'd be able to play

277
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:49,649
in this tournament
because of it.

278
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:51,416
-Nothing like an easy
victory to get back

279
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:52,782
in the swing of
things, huh guys?

280
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:55,016
See you later.

281
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:57,316
-What do you know This
time he didn't quit.

282
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,282
-Wow.

283
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,982
He only leaves just that
one mark on the wall.

284
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:07,016
RYOMA: Talking to me?

285
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:07,916
-Oh!

286
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:08,916
Sorry.

287
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:11,649
I-- I didn't mean
to interrupt you.

288
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:13,749
-You didn't interrupt me at all.

289
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:14,849
What do you want?

290
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:18,782
-Oh, um, well, your
match is soon and I-- I

291
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:21,716
wish you luck, Ryoma.

292
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:22,216
-Huh?

293
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:36,849
-Woe is me.

294
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,582
[meow]

295
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:39,349
-Ah, Karupin.

296
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:41,282
I have something for you.

297
00:13:41,316 --> 00:13:42,982
See how you like this.

298
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:50,382
-Hey.

299
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,682
-What?

300
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:53,849
-Looks like your next match
is with Kaidoh, isn't it?

301
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:54,449
-I don't know.

302
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:55,316
Probably.

303
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:56,949
-That's a risky attitude.

304
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:58,749
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

305
00:13:58,782 --> 00:14:01,482
You'd better be careful
with that viper.

306
00:14:01,516 --> 00:14:02,282
-Viper?

307
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:03,616
-That's what they call him.

308
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:04,416
-Oh.

309
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:06,016
All right.

310
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:08,716
-That kid's crazier than I am.

311
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:10,116
[hiss]

312
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,349
-Kaidoh's hissing again.

313
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:22,616
-Echizen won't have
it so easy this time.

314
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:24,649
-This could be very
interesting if he's

315
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:26,482
able to handle
Kaidoh's trick shot.

316
00:14:26,516 --> 00:14:27,749
It's going to be fun to watch.

317
00:14:27,782 --> 00:14:28,249
-Hm.

318
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:49,782
ANNOUNCER: This as a
best of one set match.

319
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:50,982
Service, Echizen.

320
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:44,282
-Come on, you got him now.

321
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:48,682
-He got it!

322
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:17,116
-15-Love.

323
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,549
-Boy, that was lucky.

324
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:20,949
-One blink and you would've
missed it completely.

325
00:16:20,982 --> 00:16:23,916
-If he keeps this up,
he'll win, I know it!

326
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,016
-You forget.

327
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:27,016
Kaidoh uses that trick
shot, and Echizen.

328
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:28,282
Doesn't know about it yet.

329
00:16:44,516 --> 00:16:47,449
[hissing]

330
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,816
[meowing]

331
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:55,682
-Hey, hey.

332
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:56,482
Here it is.

333
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,882
Come and get it.

334
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:58,849
Come and get it.

335
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,382
-Kaidoh wasn't
expecting that one.

336
00:17:38,749 --> 00:17:41,849
[hissing laughter]

337
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:42,982
-Ryoma, you rule!

338
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:55,049
-He's gonna do his trick shot.

339
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:23,182
-Oh no.

340
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:26,016
-15 all.

341
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:26,682
-What was that?

342
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:28,016
It was weird.

343
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,716
-It was going one way and
then it went the other.

344
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:32,349
-It's early for trick shots.

345
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:33,482
-Can't be good.

346
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:35,282
-It just means he's really
serious about winning

347
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:35,982
the match.

348
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:36,916
-That shot.

349
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,682
It's the one we
saw in the video.

350
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:39,482
-You're right.

351
00:18:39,516 --> 00:18:41,582
-That's Kaidoh's snake shot.

352
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:42,349
-You mean--

353
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:43,616
-That's what he calls it?

354
00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:45,316
-So that's why he hisses.

355
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:46,282
-Yep.

356
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:47,416
And only someone
like Kaidoh can do it

357
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:48,816
because of his long reach.

358
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:50,982
When he sees the ball
approach, he shifts his weight

359
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:52,816
from his right leg
to his left, then

360
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:55,582
he swings as hard as he
can, putting a lot of spin

361
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:56,716
on the ball.

362
00:18:56,749 --> 00:19:00,582
It's a very tricky shot,
but that's the viper.

363
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:01,516
Sneaky.

364
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,882
Always hissing.

365
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,516
He's a snake, totally.

366
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:06,649
He probably sleeps
all coiled up.

367
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,221
-Look at those mountain peaks.

368
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,721
Spectacular scenery indeed.

369
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:24,134
Don't lose to a snake, Karupin.

370
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:31,498
Ow!

371
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:33,065
You're supposed to grab
the snake, not my toe,

372
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:34,765
you dumb cat!

373
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,865
-Sakuno, I don't like
the looks of this.

374
00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:39,198
Kaidoh's trick shot may
be too much for Ryoma.

375
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:40,865
-Maybe the challenge
is too great.

376
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:44,132
Playing against a regular was
bound to be tough for him.

377
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:45,565
-Hm.

378
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:49,865
[hissing]

379
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:50,965
-Hm.

380
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:53,432
So that's the angle
he uses for this shot.

381
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:54,332
Ha.

382
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:58,032
You still have a ways to go.

383
00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:00,434
Time to kill a viper.

384
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,134
-Huh?

385
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,234
He's using his left--

386
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,634
-That means Kaidoh's
really in for it now.

387
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:18,334
-Shiba, this match
is just beginning.

388
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:28,312
[theme music]

389
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,116
KACHIRO: Hi, everyone.

390
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,809
Kato here.

391
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,809
Boy, this match up
is something else.

392
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,343
Ryoma and Kaidoh have me
on the edge of my seat,

393
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:07,009
and I'm not even sitting down!

394
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:09,609
Kaidoh uses an amazing
technique called the snake shot,

395
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,676
and he's giving Ryoma
all he can handle.

396
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:13,809
But it's not over yet.

397
00:21:13,843 --> 00:21:15,543
There's plenty more
surprises to come,

398
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:18,809
and you wouldn't even believe
me if I told you what was gonna

399
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:20,209
happen, so I won't!

400
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:23,109
Next, on the "Prince
of Tennis," Snake Shot.

401
00:21:23,143 --> 00:21:25,582
You have to watch it!
