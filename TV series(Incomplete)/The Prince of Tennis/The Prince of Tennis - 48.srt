1
00:00:10,962 --> 00:00:12,182
-Drive A

2
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:20,695
-Akutsu, no!

3
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:27,862
-Hitting a drive volley
from that short distance,

4
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:28,762
That's intense.

5
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:38,128
-You shouldn't underrate
tennis the way you do.

6
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:42,128
[theme music]

7
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:14,095
-You're wasting your time, brat.

8
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:20,095
Come get it.

9
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:30,562
Don't make me laugh.

10
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:46,904
That's useless.

11
00:01:54,737 --> 00:01:57,870
-Tennis is a unique
kind of sport

12
00:01:57,904 --> 00:02:01,570
that ultimately depends on both
technique and mental agility

13
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:02,170
as well.

14
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:11,170
-Hey, if you stuck
to karate, you

15
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:14,937
wouldn't have a shrimp
like me beating you.

16
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,237
-There's no way.

17
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:31,304
-Akutsu's pride or
Echizen's courage?

18
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:34,104
Whichever one is stronger
will give us the winner.

19
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,337
-So it's come down to this.

20
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,604
Finally, it's match
point Echizen.

21
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:04,837
-Amazing.

22
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,537
You did great forcing
Akutsu into this.

23
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,837
Go for it, Echizen.

24
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,104
One more point and
we'll be the champs.

25
00:03:12,137 --> 00:03:14,370
-I didn't expect you
to play this well.

26
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:16,204
-I guess we're not
quite evenly matched.

27
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,037
-Shut up, brat.

28
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,737
-You can do it, Ryoma.

29
00:03:30,604 --> 00:03:32,170
-Come on, Echizen.

30
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:33,670
You can beat him.

31
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:37,437
-Hey, Horio, can't you
just watch quietly?

32
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:37,937
-Why?

33
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,104
What for?

34
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,637
This is the most critical
moment of the match.

35
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,070
-That's exactly why .

36
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:43,637
This is the first
time I've watched

37
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,470
to great match like this.

38
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:48,237
I'm going to watch it
very closely because I

39
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,537
want to be sure to remember it.

40
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,504
-You're right, Kachiro.

41
00:03:51,537 --> 00:03:54,404
We'll want to remember this one.

42
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:55,304
-I guess so.

43
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:00,770
Echizen, I'm begging you!

44
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:02,770
-Will you shut up.

45
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,604
NANJIRO (VOICEOVER):
High up in the sky,

46
00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:14,237
the skylark is twittering,
beautiful heaven-- ah whatever.

47
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:19,537
-What of Akutsu?

48
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,037
-We'll know any moment.

49
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,704
-That's for sure, but how
will both players take it?

50
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:25,904
INOUE (VOICEOVER): Will
Akutsu's wild animal instinct

51
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:27,570
give him the advantage?

52
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:30,437
Or will the samurai
in training win?

53
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,137
Either way, from now
on, there's going

54
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,737
to be a fine line between
winning and losing.

55
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,770
It won't simply be a
matter of technique.

56
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,804
-Akutsu is very focused now.

57
00:05:01,837 --> 00:05:03,437
If Echizen gets even
a little careless,

58
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,170
Akutsu will turn
this match around.

59
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:09,170
-Look, the super rising shot.

60
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,937
-OK, kid, let's
see what you got.

61
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:14,437
Bring it on.

62
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:32,570
AKUTSU (VOICEOVER): Yeah,
keep hitting the ball to me.

63
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:45,470
I don't feel it.

64
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:46,470
Brat.

65
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:46,970
Brat.

66
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:55,637
-Looks good.

67
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,104
You can do it, Echizen.

68
00:05:58,137 --> 00:06:00,270
-Question is, how
long will he be

69
00:06:00,304 --> 00:06:02,204
able to hold that
level of concentration?

70
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,170
-What?

71
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:06,204
-Inui is right.

72
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:09,370
Echizen's concentration
won't last forever.

73
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:12,870
It's a very tense situation,
similar to a string stretched

74
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,637
extremely tight.

75
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,670
There's no string that
won't break at some point.

76
00:06:34,337 --> 00:06:36,170
-Oh, and by the
way, don't forget

77
00:06:36,204 --> 00:06:39,070
that you still owe me big time.

78
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:41,170
This is for Kawamura.

79
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:43,704
And this is for Arai.

80
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,704
Who you beat up.

81
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:49,570
I'm not finished with you yet.

82
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:51,404
You also threw stones at me.

83
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:06,004
-It's the [inaudible].

84
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:15,004
-I already know how
to return that shot.

85
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:16,570
-He returned it.

86
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:19,670
-And from pinpoint range.

87
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:21,104
-Come on, brat.

88
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,137
-Look out, Echizen.

89
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:26,637
-Echizen!

90
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:06,937
AKUTSU (VOICEOVER): What's this?

91
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,437
A drop volley?

92
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,170
JUDGE: Game and match.

93
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,004
Seigaku's Echizen.

94
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:20,437
-Echizen did it.

95
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:20,937
-Whoa.

96
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:33,370
-That guy's crazy.

97
00:08:37,937 --> 00:08:39,470
-Watch out, Echizen.

98
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:41,570
TOMOKA: Ryoma!

99
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,270
-I won the match, but I
think you played fairly well,

100
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:46,570
for the most part anyway.

101
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,637
[laughing]

102
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:03,470
-He won.

103
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:04,570
He actually won.

104
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:05,604
That kid is great.

105
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:11,770
[cheering]

106
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:40,146
-Boy, that was an
amazing victory.

107
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,112
[interposing voices]

108
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:48,112
-Coach Ryuzaki,
you did very well.

109
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:49,579
-Well, it wasn't just me.

110
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:52,779
It's because everyone played
their best and refused to quit.

111
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:54,779
-We'll beat you next time.

112
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:57,279
In any event, this was
a humbling experience

113
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:58,312
for Yamabuki.

114
00:09:58,346 --> 00:10:00,379
Well, I'll be going now.

115
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:02,279
-Oh, Mr. Banda?

116
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:03,179
-What is it?

117
00:10:03,212 --> 00:10:05,246
-We must enjoy playing tennis.

118
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,612
I think today's matches
really showed that.

119
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,146
-You made it, Echizen.

120
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:16,946
-You're great, kid.

121
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:19,846
-My juice is just the
thing for exhaustion.

122
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:22,946
-Get that away from me.

123
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:24,412
-Oh, honey.

124
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:24,912
Huh?

125
00:10:31,212 --> 00:10:31,679
Huh?

126
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,712
-He's really something special.

127
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:41,012
-Yeah, I agree.

128
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:43,679
-But Fudomine isn't really
satisfied with the results,

129
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:44,379
right?

130
00:10:44,412 --> 00:10:46,079
Connors against McEnroe.

131
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,579
Gilbert versus Lendl.

132
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:49,212
Navratilova and Graf.

133
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:50,979
Sampras and Agassi.

134
00:10:51,012 --> 00:10:52,579
Davenport and Venus.

135
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:55,579
It's rivalries like these that
make tennis so interesting.

136
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:01,912
Here.

137
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:04,312
You gave me a soda
just the other day.

138
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:06,446
I've been feeling bad because
I didn't have anything

139
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:07,846
to give you in return.

140
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,279
Sorry, but this
isn't very cold now.

141
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:11,779
-Oh.

142
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:19,979
-Build up your power because
I'm sure looking forward

143
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,046
to seeing your next match.

144
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:22,879
-All right.

145
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:24,212
Thank you for those kind works.

146
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:34,546
-Hey, Akutsu, come on.

147
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:36,179
It was a close match.

148
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,779
Don't take it so hard.

149
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:41,112
-But, Akutsu, don't.

150
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:43,746
-I know you're
frustrated, Akutsu.

151
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:49,479
It was your first loss, and
that's always the toughest one.

152
00:11:49,512 --> 00:11:53,479
But facing up to difficulty
means you have potential.

153
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,079
It's important you
understand this

154
00:11:55,112 --> 00:11:57,946
applies on the court and life.

155
00:11:57,979 --> 00:11:59,712
So playing tennis isn't so--

156
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:00,412
-It's boring.

157
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:01,646
-Huh?

158
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,479
-I'm not interested in
playing tennis, not anymore.

159
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:06,779
Playing that kid,
that was enough for me

160
00:12:06,812 --> 00:12:10,246
to realize I'm through with it.

161
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:10,912
Out of my way.

162
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,679
-I guess he just
got too burned out.

163
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:24,579
-You were saying she
isn't your girlfriend?

164
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:25,612
-Is that true?

165
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:26,946
-Yeah.

166
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,912
I've tried to tell people a
million times, but no luck.

167
00:12:29,946 --> 00:12:33,312
-Well, then, can you
tell us who she is?

168
00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:37,246
-Uh, Yuki, is Akutsu's mom.

169
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,646
-What?

170
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,712
-But all this time, you've been
calling her by her first name,

171
00:12:40,746 --> 00:12:41,946
like you two were close.

172
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:43,012
-Well, it's like this.

173
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:45,046
She gets mad if I
don't call her Yuki.

174
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:46,879
-And just how old is she anyway?

175
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:49,012
-I think she's about 33.

176
00:12:49,046 --> 00:12:51,279
-She's quite young to
be Akutsu's mother.

177
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,279
-I get it now.

178
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:53,379
No wonder we misunderstood.

179
00:12:56,012 --> 00:12:58,746
JUDGE: We will now announce
the results of the five schools

180
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:02,779
that will advance to
the Kanto Tournament.

00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:07,546
matches.

183
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,512
In boys team competition, the
champion is Seishun Academy.

184
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:12,179
Congratulations.

185
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:22,846
Next is the runner up.

186
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,079
Yamabuki Junior High School.

187
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:29,012
Third place goes to
Ginka Junior High School.

188
00:13:29,046 --> 00:13:32,712
Fourth place is Fudomine
Junior High School.

189
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:36,046
And the fifth place
team in Hyotei Academy,

190
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,446
which won the consolation match.

191
00:13:42,346 --> 00:13:44,412
-Hm, that's no surprise.

192
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:45,912
Am I right, Kabaji?

193
00:13:45,946 --> 00:13:46,879
-Yeah.

194
00:13:46,912 --> 00:13:48,479
-Just look at him.

195
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:51,246
No wonder he's a
nationally ranked player.

196
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,112
Keigo Atobe is
incredibly strong.

197
00:13:54,146 --> 00:13:57,712
He was even able to fight
off Mizuki with ease.

198
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:59,879
There's no doubt Hyotei
will be advancing

199
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:03,379
far into the regional
matches, and then there's

200
00:14:03,412 --> 00:14:05,079
Jiro to deal with.

201
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:07,812
He beat Yuuta in only minutes.

202
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,312
We'll have to watch out for him.

203
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:10,112
-I'm sleepy.

204
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,079
-Hey, where's Tomoka?

205
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:18,179
-Oh, she went to watch
the awards ceremony.

206
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:19,379
-So what are you doing here?

207
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:20,912
Didn't you want to watch it?

208
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:22,146
-Not really.

209
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:25,112
I mean, I already saw Ryoma,
and I congratulated him

210
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:25,946
on his victory.

211
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,712
What's the matter, Sakuno?

212
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,712
-It's something I noticed
watching Ryoma's match.

213
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:39,012
I felt like Ryoma was off
in another world far away.

214
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,679
I told him how I
felt but I'm not

215
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:43,179
sure my words reached his ears.

216
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:46,279
JUDGE: And for this, the
end of the awards ceremony.

217
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:56,579
-Come on, how 'bout it?

218
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:57,346
Let's go, Sakuno.

219
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:58,246
-Huh?

220
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,746
-We can cheer him on again.

221
00:15:02,312 --> 00:15:04,479
You know, I've seen a
lot of people like him.

222
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:08,112
They concentrate so hard,
they can't see or hear anyone.

223
00:15:08,146 --> 00:15:10,846
But I still sense that they
do want us to be there,

224
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,479
and I have a feeling that our
support does make a difference

225
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,479
to them, even if
they can't show it.

226
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:17,612
-Support?

227
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:20,079
-Hm, every player must
stand out there alone

228
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:21,346
on the tennis court.

229
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,479
No one is there to help them.

230
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:24,746
But you know what?

231
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:28,212
Sometimes I can feel our
cheers making Ryoma stronger.

232
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:31,512
Giving him that extra something
that he needs, especially

233
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:33,479
when he's struggling in a match.

234
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:35,312
I absolutely believe it.

235
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:36,546
Just take today's match.

236
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:37,612
You saw what happened.

237
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,712
[cheering]

238
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:49,612
-Go for it, Echizen!

239
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:57,246
-Now, listen,
Sakuno, you can make

240
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,212
Ryoma stronger by
supporting him 100%.

241
00:16:00,246 --> 00:16:03,246
You can do it.

242
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,012
-Thank you.

243
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:06,279
-Well, let's get going then.

244
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:06,779
Come on.

245
00:16:06,812 --> 00:16:07,279
-OK.

246
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:14,512
-Ryoma won.

247
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:17,512
What do you think of that?

248
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:20,112
You think he still
has a ways to go?

249
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,012
-And just what's your
point, Mr. Inoue?

250
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:24,079
-Nothing.

251
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:27,279
-Come on now, you've
raised my curiosity.

252
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:31,646
-Watching today's matches I felt
there was a new wind blowing

253
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,979
in the world of tennis out
there, don't you think?

254
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:38,179
I thought we had entered an era
where it was no longer possible

255
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:41,346
for a Japanese tennis player
to reach the world class level

256
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:44,412
as you did, and as a
consequence of that,

257
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:49,279
there would be no more great
players like you to emerge.

258
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:51,546
-There are no national
borders in tennis.

259
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:53,846
You're either a strong
player or a weak one.

260
00:16:56,712 --> 00:16:59,712
-Nanjiro, tell me, do you
think Ryoma will play well

261
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:01,579
at the world class
level when he's older?

262
00:17:15,246 --> 00:17:17,612
-(SINGING) Not yet, not at all.

263
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:19,546
Not yet, not on your life.

264
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:33,679
-Akutsu, they say you're
quitting the tennis team.

265
00:17:33,712 --> 00:17:35,312
Tell me why.

266
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,379
How could you?

267
00:17:36,412 --> 00:17:38,612
You're big, tall,
strong and confident.

268
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:41,046
I only wish I could
be like you, but I

269
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,612
know that there's no
way that'll ever happen.

270
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,712
Why are you leaving?

271
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:47,879
Please don't resign.

272
00:17:55,812 --> 00:17:59,379
-Taiichi, if your
goal is to be like me

273
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,046
you won't have much of a future.

274
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,979
There's no possibility
for you beyond that.

275
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:19,612
He's someone for you to
possibly model yourself after.

276
00:18:19,646 --> 00:18:22,412
He looks like he's
waiting for ya.

277
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:24,746
Later.

278
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:25,312
-Akutsu!

279
00:18:29,746 --> 00:18:33,012
I'm gonna get on the
tennis court as a player,

280
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:35,379
just you wait and see.

281
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:36,379
No, I will!

282
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:47,746
Echizen, aren-- I'm going
to become a player instead

283
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:49,946
of just being a manager.

284
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:53,246
And then someday, I'm going to
have a match with you and win.

285
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:58,146
-You still have a
long ways to go.

286
00:19:01,046 --> 00:19:01,946
-Excuse me.

287
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:04,246
-It was only the Metropolitan,
so don't get conceited.

288
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:07,112
Hey, you over there.

289
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:07,846
-OK, Dad.

290
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:14,646
I'll make you cry.

291
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:16,146
-Here we go.

292
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:40,619
[theme music]

293
00:22:08,823 --> 00:22:10,656
-Hey, here's Horio.

294
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:12,956
Now that we won the
Metropolitan matches,

295
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:15,923
it's about time we concentrate
on the academic side.

296
00:22:15,956 --> 00:22:19,389
I'll find romance and do
my best in club activities.

297
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:22,789
But I tell you, Echizen really
loves to get into fights.

298
00:22:22,823 --> 00:22:24,256
He'll get in real
big trouble if he

299
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:25,823
acts like he's got
a swelled head just

300
00:22:25,856 --> 00:22:27,423
because he can speak English.

301
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:28,489
What?

302
00:22:28,523 --> 00:22:30,256
There's an intruder
at the tennis club?

303
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:33,656
Next, on the "Prince of
Tennis, Freestyle Fighting."

304
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:36,156
Hey, calm down, everyone.

305
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,923
Calm down.
