1
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:24,671
-Still got a ways to go.

2
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:37,038
You've still got a ways to go.

3
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:41,905
[creaking]

4
00:00:41,938 --> 00:00:43,338
[meow]

5
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:46,505
-Hm?

6
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:52,405
-Hey, it's time to wake up.

7
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:54,638
We're going out.

8
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:57,605
[theme music]

9
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:21,826
-So, where are we headed anyway?

10
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,260
-It's like this.

11
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:25,126
A friend of mine's
granddaughter has just

12
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,693
started playing
tennis, so she called

13
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:31,960
to ask me if I'd be
interested in coaching her.

14
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:34,226
Eat some.

15
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,993
I have lots of stuff
to do, so I thought

16
00:02:36,026 --> 00:02:37,793
you'd like to coach her.

17
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:38,660
How about that?

18
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,026
-You can't be serious.

19
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:44,126
-All right, here we are.

20
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,893
This is it.

21
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:51,860
Better get going.

22
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:56,526
Right there.

23
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,093
-But-- But, dad.

24
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:00,093
-Hey, thanks a lot.

25
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:01,826
You know, for coaching the kid.

26
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,393
-But I don't wanna.

27
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:06,260
-You can't say no,
because that little bean

28
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:10,560
cake was a gift from my
grateful friend, and you ate it.

29
00:03:10,593 --> 00:03:11,260
-Huh?

30
00:03:11,293 --> 00:03:13,160
-See you later!

31
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,926
Thanks again my helpful son.

32
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,226
-Hey, wait a minute.

33
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,493
Dad!

34
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:21,926
-I'm outta here!

35
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,793
-I can't believe it.

36
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:24,960
He tricked me again.

37
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:25,860
GIRL: Hey, Ryoma!

38
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:29,260
You really showed up!

39
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:29,760
Ryoma!

40
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:38,960
-I just decided that I'd
come along and be a hitting

41
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:40,660
partner for my friend Sakuno.

42
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:43,060
Are you going to
be our coach, then?

43
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:46,493
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): The
granddaughter of his friend?

44
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,660
My dad's crazy.

45
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,260
-I feel sick.

46
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:54,460
I overdid it.

47
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:56,926
Looks like I ate too
many of those bean cakes.

48
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:19,026
-You're both way too tense.

49
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,526
-Kay.

50
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:27,493
-Uh, Ryoma?

51
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:29,960
I'm sorry they
made you coach us.

52
00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:32,793
-It's not a problem,
but you should

53
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:35,060
try to bend your
knees a little more.

54
00:04:35,093 --> 00:04:36,093
-Got it!

55
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:38,226
SAKUNO (VOICEOVER):
All right, Sakuno.

56
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,626
Now's your chance
to impress him.

57
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,526
-There!

58
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,126
Oops.

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,926
-Just try to hit it.

60
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,426
-Yeah.

61
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,560
-Between the both of us,
we could only buy two.

62
00:05:05,593 --> 00:05:09,060
Let's mark our balls so we
can find them easier later.

63
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:10,060
-Sounds good.

64
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,526
Hm.

65
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,793
What did you draw on yours?

66
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:24,226
-This.

67
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,093
-Wow.

68
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,426
That's so cool.

69
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,960
-I can draw one on
yours if you want.

70
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:30,360
-You're the best!

71
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:40,760
-I'm done.

72
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:59,993
That makes eight,
and nine, and ten!

73
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,460
Ryoma, look at me.

74
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:03,960
I hit the ball 11
times in a row.

75
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:04,926
-Nice, Tomo!

76
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,426
That's great.

77
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,393
-Ah!

78
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:10,760
Oh no, I missed the ball.

79
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:14,093
-Try holding your racket at
the very end of the grip.

80
00:06:14,126 --> 00:06:15,060
-Oh.

81
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:15,993
Like this?

82
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:20,226
Wow.

83
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,493
That's much better.

84
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:22,026
-Mm-hm.

85
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,993
-Yes, Tomo.

86
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,460
SAKUNO (VOICEOVER): Even though
this is only her second lesson,

87
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:31,893
Tomo can just keep hitting
that ball over and over.

88
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:35,126
She's got natural
ability, but I'll

89
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
practice hard and become
a good player too.

90
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:42,160
I'll just relax bend my knees,
and keep my eye on the ball.

91
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:56,726
Now I've done it.

92
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,726
I'll go get the ball!

93
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,726
-Sakuno!

94
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,160
Do you want me to come with you?

95
00:07:01,193 --> 00:07:02,226
-No, I'll be fine!

96
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:19,493
That was embarrassing.

97
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:25,526
Even though I practice every
day, I'm not getting better.

98
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,860
Uh, oh, I found it.

99
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,126
I've almost got it.

100
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,060
Huh?

101
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,526
-What do you think
you're doing there, kid?

102
00:07:52,560 --> 00:08:00,193
-It's just, I lost-- My ball
ended up over on your court.

103
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:03,760
-All right.

104
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:07,660
Come on over and get it.

105
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:09,160
-Excuse me, please.

106
00:08:09,193 --> 00:08:10,093
-Go ahead.

107
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:11,093
Get your ball.

108
00:08:11,126 --> 00:08:13,360
But don't dare
interrupt our practice.

109
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,093
-Oh, I won't.

110
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:30,426
-Aw, I'm so sorry.

111
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,560
I guess I goofed.

112
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,126
-I wonder where the heck Sakuno
went to find that lost ball?

113
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,626
Huh?

114
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:55,993
Sakuno?

115
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,826
-You better hurry
up, little girl.

116
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,060
-Yeah, you're wasting our
valuable court time, kid.

117
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:16,860
-Sorry.

118
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:19,026
-We're on the Ginka
team, and we're

119
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,460
playing in the semifinals
of the Metropolitan matches.

120
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:23,393
-Ryoma!

121
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:26,226
Ryoma, come quickly!

122
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,060
Something bad is happening!

123
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:30,826
Your time is up.

124
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,526
-Come on, you're
keeping us waiting.

125
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,526
-Uh.

126
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,026
Ryoma's face is on the ball.

127
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,493
I gotta find it.

128
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:41,493
-You better hurry up and
get lost, little girl.

129
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:42,926
You're holding up our practice.

130
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,926
-Wait a minute.

131
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,893
My ball has a
special mark on it.

132
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:48,860
I just need some more time.

133
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:50,026
-Get lost.

134
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,626
What part of that
don't you understand?

135
00:09:56,226 --> 00:09:57,293
-Did you see that?

136
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:58,626
It came out of nowhere.

137
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,126
-Argh.

138
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:03,326
Huh?

139
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,760
-What just happened?

140
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:05,826
-Check that out.

141
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,026
-Who's that kid?

142
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,860
You think he's--

143
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:13,993
-He's the one who hit the ball?

144
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:16,426
-Unbelievable.

145
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,793
-I'm sorry.

146
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,493
Looks like my ball's
in your court.

147
00:10:24,726 --> 00:10:26,026
-Wow, that kid.

148
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,526
He aimed that ball.

149
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,326
-Yeah, looks he aimed it right
through that hole in the fence

150
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,493
from all the way over there.

151
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,126
-That punk!

152
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:48,163
[cat screeching]

153
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:04,130
-Hey, just who do
you think you are,

154
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,497
stepping on our court like that?

155
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,197
-Sakuno.

156
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,730
Did you find your ball?

157
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:10,163
-No, I didn't.

158
00:11:10,197 --> 00:11:13,730
With so many of them, I can't
tell which ball is mine.

159
00:11:13,763 --> 00:11:15,763
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): She'll
never find it in there.

160
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:16,697
-Hey, cowboy!

161
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,197
Are you listening to me?

162
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,263
I'm talking to you!

163
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:21,330
You took your best
shot, and you know what?

164
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:23,363
You're just lucky
you're alive, punk!

165
00:11:23,397 --> 00:11:24,697
-Did that hurt?

166
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,730
Sorry.

167
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:27,963
Say, could you help
us find her ball?

168
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:29,830
-You better get out
of here before I

169
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:32,963
rearrange your smug face, kid.

170
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:33,730
-Come on, now.

171
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:35,530
Don't get so mad at the kid.

172
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:42,997
-Oh, yeah.

173
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,463
-There are more than
300 balls on this court.

174
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,063
You're holding up our practice.

175
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:50,797
You can't expect us to wait all
day for you to find one ball.

176
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,530
-That girl over
there with the braids

177
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:54,897
is the one who knocked
over our ball cart.

178
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,397
-No!

179
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,830
I didn't!

180
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:59,197
-Ryoma, he's hiding the
ball behind his back.

181
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,797
I can see it.

182
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,963
-Who's that girl?

183
00:12:01,997 --> 00:12:03,263
Another little squirt?

184
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:04,730
-Scram, kid.

185
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:05,563
-Will not!

186
00:12:05,597 --> 00:12:06,530
I know that you have our balls.

187
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:09,063
I saw them with my 20-20 vision.

188
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:09,930
I'm sure of it!

189
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:14,430
-I had a feeling about this.

190
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,730
-That girl's a liar.

191
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:17,430
-You guys are the liars.

192
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:19,830
You're being really,
really mean, you know that?

193
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:22,097
-So what if I am?

194
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,030
Huh?

195
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:24,730
-How about this?

196
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,263
10 balls each.

197
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:31,097
-Huh?

198
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,797
I'll play you all, and if I
lose, we'll give up searching.

199
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:40,063
But if I win, you've got to
give the girls back their balls.

200
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:42,497
-You're crazy.

201
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,863
-So, are you scared?

202
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,063
-We each play 10 balls?

203
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:49,030
There are 30 of us to beat.

204
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:51,230
That's insane!

205
00:12:51,263 --> 00:12:52,163
-I like it.

206
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,597
[laughter]

207
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,563
-Hmph.

208
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:00,530
-Huh?

209
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:01,763
Hm.

210
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:04,530
Well, if you can beat us
all, their balls are yours.

211
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:07,163
And every other one
we've got out here, too.

212
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:08,063
-OK, everyone.

213
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:08,930
Come on over here.

214
00:13:08,963 --> 00:13:09,730
Let's go, guys.

215
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,630
-So, who's going down first?

216
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:30,863
BOY: Hey, Akutsu?

217
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:32,397
I'm not sure about this.

218
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,030
I could get in a lot of
trouble for letting a student

219
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:37,063
from another school
in here, you know?

220
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,930
Huh?

221
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:45,763
Hey, what do you think
you're doing now?

222
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:46,263
Akutsu!

223
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:50,197
-So, where's my money?

224
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,997
-Huh?

225
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,497
What are you talking about?

226
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,797
-I want cash.

227
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,663
-Let's stop all this, man.

228
00:13:56,697 --> 00:13:59,230
I don't have any money.

229
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:00,663
Huh?

230
00:14:00,697 --> 00:14:03,030
-Hey.

231
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:04,330
What did you say?

232
00:14:04,363 --> 00:14:07,763
Don't you-- don't you
dare order me around.

233
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,963
Don't you mess
with me, my friend.

234
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,863
-Our next opponent is Ginka.

235
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:28,797
We've never played them
before, but if they're

236
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,263
in the semifinals,
they're probably good.

237
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:33,430
-I heard that they
have a killer team.

238
00:14:33,463 --> 00:14:37,030
-Suzuki, take the kid apart!

239
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:38,063
-Expect nothing less.

240
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:43,863
This should make him cry.

241
00:14:47,397 --> 00:14:48,430
There!

242
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:50,930
-Fukushi and Tashiro
are singles players.

243
00:14:50,963 --> 00:14:51,863
And Suzuki?

244
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:53,497
Well, I've heard
they're all tough.

245
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,263
-That was too good!

246
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:01,230
-Check it out.

247
00:15:01,263 --> 00:15:02,630
Sure that short kid's not bad.

248
00:15:02,663 --> 00:15:03,597
-You jerk.

249
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,763
Suzuki's just playing sloppy.

250
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:07,797
Get up, Suzuki.

251
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:11,463
-Who's next?

252
00:15:11,497 --> 00:15:12,263
-My turn.

253
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:13,363
I'll destroy you.

254
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:15,497
-Tashiro, you better
watch out for him.

255
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,597
-Watch and learn, cupcake.

256
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:27,297
-Huh?

257
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:27,797
-Huh?

258
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,297
-Huh?

259
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,130
-Yes!

260
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:35,563
Ryoma rocks!

261
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:36,163
-Next?

262
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:37,163
-Aw man.

263
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:39,830
He just took out
our five best guys.

264
00:15:39,863 --> 00:15:41,297
What are we gonna
do to stop him?

265
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,397
It's embarrassing.

266
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,130
-Who is he, and where'd
he come from anyway?

267
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:46,063
-Who cares?

268
00:15:46,097 --> 00:15:48,663
We're just gonna
have to crush him.

269
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,730
-I heard Ginka's got another
regular named Domoto who's

270
00:15:51,763 --> 00:15:54,397
supposed to be a
really strong player.

271
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,597
His big serve could certainly
give us some trouble.

272
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,930
-Then I have good news.

273
00:16:00,963 --> 00:16:04,863
Inui's on his way to Ginka
to check out the competition.

274
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:05,997
-Hey, I'm here.

275
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,230
It's all over.

276
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:08,563
BOY: Come on, Domoto!

277
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:11,363
We're counting on you!

278
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:13,063
BOY: He's gotta
be getting tired.

279
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:17,997
BOY: Yeah, show him that
power serve of yours!

280
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,530
-All right.

281
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:19,230
Here goes.

282
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:23,630
BOY: Here it is!

283
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:24,863
Power serve!

284
00:16:24,897 --> 00:16:26,530
DOMOTO (VOICEOVER):
Let him return this.

285
00:16:29,997 --> 00:16:30,497
-Wow.

286
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,897
Hat a turn.

287
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,397
-Incredible.

288
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,397
-So, was that your warm up?

289
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:40,897
-Argh.

290
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,897
-Next?

291
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:04,263
-But we're supposed to be one of
the four best teams this year.

292
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:05,697
-How could this happen?

293
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,563
We were a slam dunk.

294
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:08,763
-All right.

295
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:13,363
Time for your next player
to step up to the plate.

296
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:14,797
Let's get going.

297
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,730
There's still 22 of you to play.

298
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:30,163
-Hey.

299
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:31,197
-Huh?

300
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,963
-Who's that short kid?

301
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:35,363
-What did you say?

302
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:39,097
Uh, I'm-- not really sure.

303
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,930
He has some serve.

304
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:47,797
That's for sure.

305
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,963
Hey, Akutsu?

306
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:11,530
I'm sorry, but it looks like
there's trouble on the court.

307
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:18,263
Uh, I know we've been buds,
but, well, can you leave now?

308
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,797
-Don't you dare order me around.

309
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,797
-Uh, I'm sorry.

310
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,297
Ah!

311
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,597
[crying out]

312
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:40,297
-Looks like that kid
got to it before I did.

313
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:47,763
I wanted to mess
with you guys, too.

314
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,097
WAITER: Here you go.

315
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,730
Enjoy.

316
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:03,097
-Those tea cakes were way
too sweet for my taste.

317
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,363
I'm sure this will be better.

318
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:10,430
-This is some nice place.

319
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,997
It's surrounded by woods, and
there's lots of fresh air here.

320
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,763
They've got ideal
playing conditions.

321
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,330
Ginka is among the best
four teams in the league.

322
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:22,997
We can't take them lightly.

323
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,197
I need data.

324
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,063
That is certain.

325
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:44,063
Their practices have
got to be really hard.

326
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:45,597
They look beat.

327
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,030
I guess we'll just have
to work harder then.

328
00:19:51,463 --> 00:19:52,897
-Nice to meet you!

329
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,330
I'm Tomoka Osakata.

330
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:56,697
-I'm Nanjiro.

331
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,763
-I can't believe we really
won all of their balls.

332
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,063
-What's going on?

333
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:04,997
-Sh.

334
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,963
-Huh?

335
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,897
-Let him sleep.

336
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,230
He deserved the rest, and more.

337
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,930
[music playing]

338
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:37,287
[theme music]

339
00:22:17,654 --> 00:22:19,954
INUI: Seigaku must train
harder than anyone.

340
00:22:19,987 --> 00:22:23,154
Well, then, I'll pump them up
with my special conditioning

341
00:22:23,187 --> 00:22:25,287
drink.

342
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:28,687
Next on "The Prince of Tennis."

343
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:29,887
Penal-tea.

344
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:33,221
Hey everybody, drink up.
