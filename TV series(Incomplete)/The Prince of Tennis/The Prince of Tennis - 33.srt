1
00:00:07,447 --> 00:00:10,314
OISHI (VOICEOVER): Curses.

2
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:12,247
BOYS: A jumping smash.

3
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:13,214
-It's over, Oishi.

4
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:23,047
-Gotta hurry.

5
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:47,047
-Here we go.

6
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,014
GIRL IN CROWD: Kikumaru.

7
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,414
Kikumaru.

8
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:50,981
-Hey there.

9
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:52,847
-I can't believe he recovered.

10
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:53,814
It's too bad.

11
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:55,914
I thought that for
sure they'd have

12
00:00:55,947 --> 00:00:58,147
to give up a game over this.

13
00:00:58,181 --> 00:01:00,581
-I wasn't sure you'd be
able to help me in time.

14
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:06,181
All right, now, time
to finish this match.

15
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:10,647
[theme music]

16
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:26,282
-Gotcha.

17
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,282
Right here.

18
00:02:36,248 --> 00:02:39,715
-How can that guy
still run so quickly?

19
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:42,415
-Wow, Seigaku's golden
pair is the coolest.

20
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:44,382
-Yeah, they're opossum
attack's a winner.

21
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:47,382
-They're sure putting
everything out there all right.

22
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:49,382
-Can't guess the
outcome at this point.

23
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:51,848
-Wow, they are good.

24
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:53,848
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Kikumaru hardly moved at all

25
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,348
during the two games,
and Oishi covered for him

26
00:02:57,382 --> 00:02:59,815
so that he could
get his second wind.

27
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:01,748
But it was their match point.

28
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:05,182
Pretty reckless.

29
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:06,648
-I'll put it away.

30
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:14,448
-Too bad, so sad.

31
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:15,415
See ya.

32
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:19,882
JUDGE: 40-30.

33
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:21,648
-That's just too good.

34
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:23,882
-Wow, Kikumaru's
totally awesome.

35
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:26,048
-Did you guys see how
he moved out there?

36
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,248
-It was so incredible.

37
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:28,248
-Go team.

38
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:29,715
Kikumaru's the best.

39
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:35,482
-Well, he certainly is
photogenic, that's for sure.

40
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,015
-Oishi pretty amazing too.

41
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:39,915
They fooled everybody.

42
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:42,948
Not least of all that
cocky doubles team from St.

43
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:44,182
Rudolph's.

44
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:47,148
I guess they proved they
really are the golden pair.

45
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:48,848
They must really
trust each other

46
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:51,948
to be able to play like that.

47
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,048
-We've got them on
the ropes, Eiji.

48
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:55,982
Now, it's time to
finish them off.

49
00:03:56,015 --> 00:03:58,315
-Yeah, I'm with you, Oishi.

50
00:03:58,348 --> 00:03:59,815
Ew, it's hot.

51
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:07,248
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER): Humph.

52
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:14,148
KANEDA (VOICEOVER): It's
still our match point.

53
00:04:14,182 --> 00:04:19,915
All we need is one
more ball and we win.

54
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:20,448
JUDGE: Fault.

55
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:28,215
Double fault.

56
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:29,115
Deuce.

57
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:30,915
-What incredible luck.

58
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:33,482
-Two more points
and it's evened out.

59
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:35,948
-Sorry, I don't know what's up.

60
00:04:35,982 --> 00:04:39,515
-Don't freak out, pal, we
are still winning this thing.

61
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:40,648
-You're right.

62
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:42,815
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER): What
are those guys doing?

63
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:46,148
They're so close to a win.

64
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:48,815
-Man, it's got to be
tough for their players.

65
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:50,015
-You bet.

66
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:51,948
-Psychologically speaking,
it's the hardest thing

67
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:54,215
in the world to lose
your lead like that.

68
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:57,348
You think you've got it won,
and then it slips away from you.

69
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:06,215
-Got it.

70
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:07,082
-There he goes again.

71
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:10,348
BOYS: Diving volley.

72
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:11,982
JUDGE: Advantage, receiver.

73
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:14,182
AKAZAWA (VOICEOVER): I can't
read their moves at all.

74
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:15,782
Their shot selection
is so weird.

75
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,315
It's hard to figure
out what to do.

76
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:19,682
KANEDA (VOICEOVER): What power.

77
00:05:19,715 --> 00:05:23,315
Seigaku has unbelievable talent.

78
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:25,515
SUMIRE (VOIEOVER): I think
they're getting flustered.

79
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:28,548
They're messed up
by Seigaku's pace.

80
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:30,882
At this rate, it's
a war of wills.

81
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:38,348
KANEDA (VOICEOVER): Not good.

82
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:40,148
We're letting them set the pace.

83
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:42,248
-Move out of the way!

84
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:44,748
-Your ball.

85
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:46,215
-The blur shot.

86
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:51,648
AKAZAWA (VOICEOVER):
His eyes are closed.

87
00:05:55,615 --> 00:05:57,282
-All right.

88
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,482
BOYS: All right,
Oishi's moon volley.

89
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:05,448
-Better back up 'cuz
it's coming right at ya.

90
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:05,915
-OK.

91
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:10,582
AKAZAWA (VOICEOVER): You can't
fool us with the same trick.

92
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:22,115
-It's a drop--

93
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:22,648
-Volley.

94
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:26,748
JUDGE: Game to Seigaku.

95
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:27,748
Six games, all.

96
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:31,248
-Yes.

97
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:33,182
-Nice trap there.

98
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,382
-Yep.

99
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:37,882
The noise his racket made
just before the volley?

100
00:06:37,915 --> 00:06:41,215
I'm absolutely sure that it
didn't mean anything at all.

101
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:42,648
BOY 1: He really did it.

102
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:43,682
Good job, Oishi.

103
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:45,848
BOY 2: They finally caught up.

104
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:48,448
-Oishi is my hero.

105
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:50,515
-Well, Eiji, we are on our way.

106
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:51,015
-Oh yeah.

107
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:55,915
-This is good.

108
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,415
They're in a tiebreaker.

109
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:58,848
-This is so exciting.

110
00:06:58,882 --> 00:06:59,348
-Man!

111
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:08,415
-They're working awfully
hard for this comeback.

112
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:10,115
JUDGE: 12 point tiebreaker.

113
00:07:10,148 --> 00:07:11,682
Seigaku's Oishi to serve.

114
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:14,048
-You don't happen to know
about tiebreaks, do you?

115
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:15,282
-I wish.

116
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:17,448
-I'll be happy to explain
them to you, girls.

117
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:21,282
They consist of 12 points and
whoever gets to 7 points first,

118
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,548
wins it all.

119
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:24,715
But if the score
is 6-6, they keep

120
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:27,148
playing until one
team wins by two.

121
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:28,815
-They keep playing?

122
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:29,948
-Don't worry.

123
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,115
Those guys will take 7
points in no time flat.

124
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:34,115
-Oh yeah.

125
00:07:34,148 --> 00:07:36,682
Our boys are burning
up the court.

126
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:37,948
-I sure hope so.

127
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:48,182
-Oishi is the first to
serve, so that's gonna mean--

128
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:49,482
-It's the Australian formation.

129
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:58,548
-In a tiebreak, the
first point is crucial.

130
00:07:58,582 --> 00:08:00,215
JUDGE: 1-0, Seigaku.

131
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:03,915
St. Rudolph's Akazawa to serve.

132
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:04,682
-Huh?

133
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:06,415
Why is the serve changing?

134
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:09,548
-From here on in, so
that it won't be unfair,

135
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:11,782
each of the players
will be consecutively

136
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:13,882
serving up two balls each.

137
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,815
-Oh no, it's--

138
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:29,182
-Too

139
00:08:29,215 --> 00:08:30,148
-What the--

140
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:30,648
-Beam!

141
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,748
JUDGE: 2-0 Seigaku.

142
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:37,515
-Yeah!

143
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:38,215
-Awesome.

144
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:39,515
They took two of them.

145
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:41,015
-There we go.

146
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:42,848
SPECTATOR 1: There's
no stopping them now.

147
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:43,748
SPECTATOR 2: Amazing.

148
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:44,848
They're just amazing.

149
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:46,748
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
This can't be happening.

150
00:08:46,782 --> 00:08:48,915
What kind of players are they?

151
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:50,482
SUMIRE (VOIEOVER):
What do you think?

152
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:54,348
Our boys have made your data
worthless, haven't they?

153
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:58,382
Tennis is fun because one
can't predict the moves.

154
00:08:58,415 --> 00:08:59,782
Isn't that so?

155
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:05,115
AKAZAWA (VOICEOVER):
They're strong.

156
00:09:05,148 --> 00:09:07,548
No wonder this pair went
all the way to he Nationals.

157
00:09:10,515 --> 00:09:13,482
-St. Rudolph's is losing
right in front of our eyes.

158
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,015
JUDGE: 3-0 Seigaku.

159
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:19,948
-All right.

160
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:21,782
-That's the way to do it.

161
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:24,215
-Only four more to go.

162
00:09:37,782 --> 00:09:39,048
-Hey, Kaneda.

163
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:40,848
-Yeah, Captain?

164
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:42,548
-Don't you ever give up.

165
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,815
What?

166
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:46,282
Are you trying to make me
play singles or something?

167
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:47,715
-I'm sorry, Captain.

168
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:50,082
-You know, we can
still win this.

169
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:50,582
-Huh?

170
00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:59,515
-In point of fact, they should
have finished this up sooner,

171
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:01,648
before they even took
it to a tiebreaker.

172
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,797
-Here's your chance, Eiji.

173
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,297
-OK.

174
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:54,630
JUDGE: 3-1 to St. Rudolph.

175
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:55,397
-Sorry.

176
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,897
-Eiji, are you all right?

177
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:57,997
-Yeah, I'm fine.

178
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,830
I'm fine.

179
00:10:58,864 --> 00:11:00,697
-Oh, that's not good.

180
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,997
-St. Rudolph's on fire.

181
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,764
They got some of
their momentum back.

182
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:11,030
-You know what,
Inui, before, you

183
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:13,630
said something that we
totally don't understand.

184
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:15,930
-Yeah, you said they should
have finished the match

185
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:18,364
before the tiebreak,
but how come?

186
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:20,564
-You'll see soon enough.

187
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,697
-Mr. Inoue, what's happening?

188
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,197
-Hm.

189
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:50,797
JUDGE: Game and
match to St. Rudolph.

190
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,197
SUMIRE (VOIEOVER):
You played well.

191
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,197
[crowd cheering]

192
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:14,730
-Sorry, Coach.

193
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:17,064
-What are you sorry about?

194
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:19,230
You two boys put on
a mighty good show.

195
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:23,464
-Oishi.

196
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:28,930
-This is the worst.

197
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:32,864
-It is just a big shame that
Kikumaru wasn't strong enough.

198
00:12:32,897 --> 00:12:33,797
No.

199
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,630
He barely had the
stamina to make

200
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:39,764
the tiebreaker, much less the
energy to play through it.

201
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:46,364
-Boy, he really ran out
of gas quickly, didn't he?

202
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:47,964
-Yeah, who'd have
guessed they could

203
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:49,230
win seven points straight.

204
00:12:58,564 --> 00:13:01,130
-I just sort of wiped out.

205
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:05,764
-You had some tough luck.

206
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:07,630
-Hey, we're sorry, you guys.

207
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,264
The rest is all yours.

208
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:12,064
-Yeah, we got it.

209
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:13,064
-We won.

210
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:14,397
This amazing.

211
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,130
I thought we were through,
but we came back from behind.

212
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,464
-You're right.

213
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:22,164
AKAZAWA (VOICEOVER): Actually,
we were just plain lucky.

214
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:24,297
-Mizuki's scenario
was so amazing.

215
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,597
He was even able to guess
that we'd win the game 7 to 6.

216
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:35,130
-Mizuki.

217
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:36,130
-Those guys got--

218
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:38,330
-Pretty hard to
believe the golden pair

219
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:40,097
would just collapse like that.

220
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,064
-Man, those guys are tough.

221
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,897
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
We're lucky to have won,

222
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,964
but the Australian formation
and Kikumaru's rebound, too many

223
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:01,230
unexpected things happened.

224
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:03,697
Even number two doubles.

225
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,064
Kaidoh's boomerang snake
and Momoshiro's dunk smash

226
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,230
that keeps getting stronger.

227
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:12,530
And then there was
that loss by default.

228
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:14,097
These were never in my scenario.

229
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:24,097
-Huh?

230
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,330
Are you serious?

231
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:26,830
-Yeah.

232
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,464
-But Mizuki's scenario
hasn't missed,

233
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,864
ever since the district matches.

234
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:59,230
If the scenario's not on track,
then it means we're slacking.

235
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,630
-It bounced up and-- whoa.

236
00:15:08,064 --> 00:15:10,897
-Whatever, but I
can't lose to Seigaku.

237
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,730
Not to Seigaku.

238
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:18,330
That's for sure.

239
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:19,964
And I won't disappoint
Mizuki, either.

240
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,297
-Huh?

241
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:34,864
Shusuke Fuji?

242
00:15:34,897 --> 00:15:37,064
Hey, that's your
big bro, isn't it?

243
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:37,964
[growls]

244
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,130
-Uh, Yuuta, I'm going on ahead.

245
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:44,464
Don't be too late.

246
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,530
-You're looking well.

247
00:15:51,564 --> 00:15:53,030
How's it going?

248
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:56,930
So tell me, you finally
getting used to dorm life yet?

249
00:15:56,964 --> 00:15:58,764
I was so sure you
would be playing

250
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:00,730
number one or two singles.

251
00:16:00,764 --> 00:16:03,164
I was looking forward
to playing against you.

252
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:05,797
-Don't lie to me, loser.

253
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,097
I'll play you
anytime you want to.

254
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:17,297
Instead, I'll crush that seventh
grader, the one who beat Inui.

255
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,597
I'll use everything I've got.

256
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,597
That punk's going down.

257
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,564
Mizuki will beat
you into the ground,

258
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:26,564
and then St. Rudolph's will win.

259
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:29,764
-Don't know about me, but that
seventh grader's really tough,

260
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:30,264
Yuuta.

261
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:36,797
-We'll find out soon.

262
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,997
Good luck, pal.

263
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,897
-Hm, that's the ball Yuuta hit.

264
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,497
What a temper.

265
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:55,897
SHUSUKE (VOICEOVER):
Mizuki, huh?

266
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:06,297
-Ryoma?

267
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:14,064
Ryoma, uh, I came to
tell you doubles lost,

268
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:19,830
and Seigaku's in big trouble.

269
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:22,430
-Huh, I wonder where
Ryoma went off to?

270
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:25,130
-I saw him around here
just a minute ago.

271
00:17:25,164 --> 00:17:26,897
-So high maintenance.

272
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,730
Of course, I know the scoop.

273
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:32,064
He's probably off taking
a nap somewhere right now.

274
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:33,530
-Third courts singles.

275
00:17:33,564 --> 00:17:36,464
It's our most
important match of all.

276
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:39,330
Do you think Echizen is ready?

277
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:40,797
-Who can tell?

278
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,764
He probably went off to
meditate and prepare himself

279
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,030
for his coming match.

280
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:15,364
-Uh, Ryoma, I heard that there's
some really strong players

281
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:18,330
in the tournament today.

282
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:22,497
Seigaku seems to be having
a very difficult time.

283
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,464
If Fudomine and Yamabuki
advance to the semi-finals,

284
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:31,464
do you think you'll have
to play Fudomine again?

285
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:48,230
KUNIMITSU: There are
lots of strong players

286
00:18:48,264 --> 00:18:50,330
in the Nationals.

287
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:51,530
-Stronger than you?

288
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,164
KUNIMITSU: Do you want
to find out for yourself?

289
00:19:14,897 --> 00:19:18,330
-Echizen, become the
pillar of Seigaku's team.

290
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:57,830
-Know what?

291
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:58,930
I'll challenge them all.

292
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,264
-Number three
singles has started.

293
00:20:08,297 --> 00:20:09,730
Come on, let's go.

294
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:16,897
ANNOUNCER: We will now begin
the number three singles

295
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:21,097
match between Seigaku
and St. Rudolph.

296
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:29,303
[theme music]

297
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,537
-This is Mizuki
from St. Rudolph.

298
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,537
The Seigaku tennis team is
playing beyond my scenario.

299
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:07,337
Ryoma Echizen, you're doing a
great job at provoking Yuuta,

300
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,570
but Yuuta is not called
lefty killer for nothing.

301
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:18,970
Next on the "Prince of
Tennis, Twist Spin Shot."

302
00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:23,203
Enjoy watching Yuuta,
the lefty killer.
