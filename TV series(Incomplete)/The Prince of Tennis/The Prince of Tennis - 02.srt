1
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:08,618
-Forget the slice serve, kid.

2
00:00:08,651 --> 00:00:09,618
Give me what you've got.

3
00:00:16,651 --> 00:01:15,130
[rock music playing]

4
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:32,740
-Here it is, our latest issue.

5
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:37,107
It should tell you all you need
to know about our magazine.

6
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,640
-You could've mailed it.

7
00:01:38,674 --> 00:01:40,840
-Yes, but our magazine
spares no effort

8
00:01:40,874 --> 00:01:43,140
in finding the best
student tennis players.

9
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:44,374
-Hmm.

10
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:45,874
So I guess you want to know
who's best around here,

11
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:46,940
is that it?

12
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,707
-Heh heh, you're on to me.

13
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,874
I'd appreciate any tips.

14
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:51,140
-My lips are sealed.

15
00:01:53,874 --> 00:01:55,107
-I wrote that article.

16
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,840
Pretty good, huh?

17
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:58,674
-You should write
more objectively.

18
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:00,407
There's no place
for sentimentality

19
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
in the game of tennis.

20
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:02,707
-What's wrong with it?

21
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,974
I grew up watching all the
great players of the day.

22
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:06,274
They were my heroes.

23
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:09,640
I wanted to be just
like Nanjiro Echizen.

24
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:10,440
-Echizen, huh?

25
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:16,674
-He was a proud flower from the
Land of the Cherry Blossoms.

26
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:18,874
And they called him the Samurai.

27
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:37,374
[crowd gasps in amazement]

28
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:42,340
ANNOUNCER: Game, set, and
match to Mister Echizen.

29
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:44,574
-When he retired from the
game at such a young age,

30
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:45,674
I was crushed.

31
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,840
If only he'd played one
or two years longer,

32
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:51,074
he would've been the top player
in the world, the grand slam.

33
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:53,007
It would've been his for
the taking, I know it.

34
00:02:56,874 --> 00:02:57,807
-Echizen.

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,040
I remember well.

36
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:02,440
GIRL: Hey, how's it going?

37
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,007
BOY: I'm OK.

38
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,574
GIRL: What's up?

39
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:04,274
BOY: Not much.

40
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:05,240
GIRL: Nice to see you.

41
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:05,874
BOY: Let's go.

42
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:06,407
GIRL: OK.

43
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,674
[bell dings]

44
00:03:12,707 --> 00:03:13,774
-Hey, Echizen, wait up.

45
00:03:17,107 --> 00:03:19,340
Yo, you're brand new
around here, aren't you?

46
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:21,407
Hey, are you going play
on the tennis team?

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,174
-Who's asking?

48
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:24,540
-My name's Horio.

49
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:25,907
Maybe you've heard
our school has

50
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,674
one of the best
teams in the country?

51
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,474
Me, I've already played for two
years at a really great tennis

52
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:31,640
camp.

53
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:32,974
They don't let just anyone
play here, you know.

54
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:34,640
But I'm a cinch
to make the team.

55
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:36,240
Huh?

56
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:39,574
Hey, Echizen, hang on!

57
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:42,540
-What's this?

58
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:44,774
The little mouse isn't
looking where he's going?

59
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,440
-Huh?

60
00:03:47,474 --> 00:03:50,440
-If he's not careful, he's
liable to end up as cat food.

61
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Huh?

62
00:03:57,274 --> 00:03:59,240
Don't think I like
that glare of yours.

63
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:00,274
Oh, well.

64
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,774
I can tell you're
new around here,

65
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,874
so I'll let it pass this time.

66
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:06,940
Just watch where you're going.

67
00:04:06,974 --> 00:04:08,874
-Who was that guy?

68
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:09,474
-I don't know.

69
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:10,074
Some goofball.

70
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:16,240
HORIO: Whoa, what a setup.

71
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:17,474
Look at those courts.

72
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,207
Seigaku's even
better than I figure.

73
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,340
Come on, Echizen.

74
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:22,040
Let's join up.

75
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:23,740
-You can forget about that.

76
00:04:23,774 --> 00:04:25,974
Today new members
can't even register

77
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,107
because of the second
and third year matches.

78
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,040
But who knows?

79
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:30,940
Maybe you can try
again tomorrow.

80
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:33,140
-Most of the freshman
have already gone home.

81
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:34,940
So we thought, why
not stay awhile

82
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,774
and pick up balls on the ground?

83
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:39,740
-But that's no fun.

84
00:04:39,774 --> 00:04:41,374
-Hey, over there.

85
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,807
You guys want to
join our tennis team?

86
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,307
-Yes, sir.

87
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,307
-You bet.

88
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,207
I'm a seventh grader,
Katsuo Mizuno.

89
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,540
-I'm Kachiro Kato.

90
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:51,674
-I'm Satoshi Horio.

91
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:54,274
I've played great tennis
for two whole years already.

92
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:58,540
I can even balance a racket
on the end of my nose.

93
00:04:58,574 --> 00:04:59,207
-Hey, you.

94
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,107
What's your problem?

95
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,940
Haven't got a name?

96
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,240
Can't talk?

97
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:06,340
You deaf, or something?

98
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:07,807
-Leave him alone.

99
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,240
All right, now we're going
to play a really fun game.

100
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:10,874
-Really?

101
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:12,074
What kind of game?

102
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:12,640
-Heh.

103
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:14,007
I know the game.

104
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,107
Yeah, yeah.

105
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,174
You're all going to
love to play this game.

106
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,240
-The rules are very simple.

107
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:21,874
You serve from the other court.

108
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:25,774
If you can knock the can over in
ten shots, you win 10,000 yen.

109
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:27,374
-What?

110
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:28,174
-That's right.

111
00:05:28,207 --> 00:05:29,440
It's kind of an initiation.

112
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:32,374
-It'll cost you 200 yen
to take the challenge.

113
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:33,040
Anyone game?

114
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:34,240
-For 10,000 yen?

115
00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:35,274
I am.

116
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:36,340
[both together] We
want to try to too.

117
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,574
-We are ready to
accept the challenge.

118
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,640
-That's the spirit.

119
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:44,574
[chuckles]

120
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:47,074
-Hmm.

121
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:48,374
-Hey, Sakuno.

122
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:50,374
Why are you so interested
in tennis all of a sudden?

123
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:52,774
-Oh, but I've
always liked tennis.

124
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:55,940
I want to go early to turn
in my registration form.

125
00:05:55,974 --> 00:05:58,707
-Hey, did you say
registration form?

126
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,774
You're going to the
tennis courts, right?

127
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,807
Thank goodness I found you.

128
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,040
I am so totally lost.

129
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:05,507
-Huh?

130
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,907
-Oh, I forgot, sorry.

131
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,274
I'm Saori Shiba.

132
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:11,207
I'm the junior editor for the
Pro Tennis Monthly magazine.

133
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,340
We're interested in the
boys team this year.

134
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,607
I hear they have some
really talented players.

135
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,474
I'm writing about
their new recruits,

136
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,574
but I can't even find
the tennis courts.

137
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:20,707
Can you?

138
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,074
-Hey, Shiba.

139
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:24,374
What are you doing over there?

140
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:26,640
-Oh, hi, Mister Inoue.

141
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:28,507
-All done with your interviews?

142
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,640
-Well, actually, I haven't
done any of them yet.

143
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:31,240
-None of them?

144
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,374
-Missed again.

145
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:37,874
Too bad, losers.

146
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:38,440
Next.

147
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:39,440
-Man oh man.

148
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:41,107
You guys are the
worst I've ever seen.

149
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,674
-But we've never played before.

150
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:45,074
What do you expect
from beginners?

151
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:46,907
-I don't think anyone
could hit that target.

152
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,507
It's too small and
much too far away.

153
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,274
-Well, then watch me.

154
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:52,640
I've had two years of tennis.

155
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,407
Hello, 10,000 yen.

156
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,907
Missed.

157
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,340
Must be a cross wind.

158
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:05,674
Well, this time for sure.

159
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:19,274
I'm losing.

160
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:20,440
-Yes you are.

161
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:24,307
And you've only got
one left to hit.

162
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,040
-It only takes one.

163
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:28,174
All I've got to do is hit
it just right, and then--

164
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:39,007
Oh, I'm a loser too.

165
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,440
-Time to settle.

166
00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:42,374
-I must have stubbed my toe.

167
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:46,507
Well, I guess that
means we're out 200 yen.

168
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,807
[all sigh]

169
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,740
-Huh?

170
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:50,374
What's the matter
with all of you?

171
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:51,407
Can't you add?

172
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,174
Read and weep, my friends.

173
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:58,007
This game costs 500 yen per
serve, plus 200 for playing.

174
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,707
Pay up.

175
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,874
You owe us 5,200 apiece.

176
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:02,107
-5,200?

177
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,174
-Where are we supposed to
find that kind of money?

178
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:06,074
-You better find it
somewhere, or else.

179
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:07,607
-Hey, you over there.

180
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,474
Too scared to try it yourself?

181
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:10,307
-What a wimp.

182
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,907
He could never play on our team.

183
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,874
-Let's get this over with.

184
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:17,874
-Echizen, don't be a fool.

185
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:19,207
You're throwing good money away.

186
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:25,907
-There's no way a normal serve
will knock that can over.

187
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,907
It's too heavy.

188
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,607
-Huh?

189
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,340
-What are you talking about?

190
00:08:30,374 --> 00:08:31,040
-Cheater.

191
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:31,840
There's rocks inside.

192
00:08:38,907 --> 00:08:40,340
-Look at that.

193
00:08:40,374 --> 00:08:44,440
He hit it square and
knocked the top right off.

194
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:47,374
-Hmm.

195
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:48,374
-Cheaters!

196
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:49,740
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

197
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:51,807
Does your mother know you cheat?

198
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,807
-Shut up.

199
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,974
My mother has nothing
to do with this.

200
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:56,207
-Kid got lucky.

201
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,574
It can happen to anyone once.

202
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,707
-If I hit it 100 times, will
you give me a million yen?

203
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:20,207
-I can't believe
I just saw that.

204
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,574
-Little squirt.

205
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:22,974
-You think you're
such hot stuff?

206
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:24,440
Well, let me tell you something.

207
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:25,840
You're going to regret this.

208
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:27,807
-The only thing worse
than a loser who cheats

209
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,340
is a bad losers who cheats.

210
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:30,540
Why don't you grow up?

211
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,007
-Asking for trouble?

212
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,074
-Whoa, what a lucky shot.

213
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:49,240
Can you spell "lucky"?

214
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:52,807
-Hey, who is that guy?

215
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,640
-What are you two doing here?

216
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:56,274
Hope you're not
threatening them.

217
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:59,074
That would be very nice,
and I might get mad.

218
00:09:59,107 --> 00:10:01,474
And that would be bad for you.

219
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:04,007
-Actually, Momo, I have to
go and do something, so--

220
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,507
-Me too.

221
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,307
-Later.

222
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,740
-Hey, we're not done, hot stuff.

223
00:10:10,774 --> 00:10:11,674
-Oh my gosh!

224
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:12,707
-What's the matter?

225
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:16,574
-Am I dreaming?

226
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:17,940
Is that Ryoma?

227
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:19,774
-Are you kidding?

228
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:21,740
Come on, let's find out.

229
00:10:21,774 --> 00:10:22,740
SAKUNO: Oh, it is him.

230
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,907
[Sakuno sighs dreamily]

231
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,574
-He's look right at me.

232
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:31,307
Sakuno, introduce us, quickly!

233
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:31,807
-Huh?

234
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,507
Oh.

235
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,874
This is Ryoma Echizen.

236
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:35,040
-Echizen?

237
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:36,407
Ryoma?

238
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,507
-Hey.

239
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,207
There's been quite a
lot of talk about you.

240
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,840
But you don't look like
anything special to me.

241
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:42,874
-Who are you?

242
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:45,140
-Name's Takeshi Momoshiro.

243
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:47,440
I wonder if what they
say about you is true.

244
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,474
I heard you know how
to do a kick serve.

245
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:50,440
-No way.

246
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:51,440
-What's a kick serve?

247
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:52,740
-Can we learn how to do it?

248
00:10:52,774 --> 00:10:54,674
-Will it hurt?

249
00:10:54,707 --> 00:10:56,040
-Want to find out?

250
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:57,240
-Let's.

251
00:10:57,274 --> 00:10:59,174
Shouldn't take me too
long to take care of you.

252
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:21,492
-You call it.

253
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,858
-I call up.

254
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:24,092
-What was all that?

255
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,058
-Haven't got a clue.

256
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:26,392
-Story of your life.

257
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:28,392
You two don't know
anything, do you?

258
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:29,825
Guess I'll have to tell you.

259
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:32,225
They're deciding who's
going to serve first.

260
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,092
See this?

261
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,225
You spin it.

262
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,458
And when it lands, it's
upright or face down.

263
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:42,258
-Down.

264
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:43,858
It's my choice.

265
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:45,258
You can have the serve.

266
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,125
I'll wait for it in
the court over here.

267
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:48,825
-Hey, aren't you
going to serve first?

268
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:51,158
What's the point of winning
the spin if you don't serve?

269
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:52,692
I don't get it.

270
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:54,958
-I want to see that
kick serve right away.

271
00:11:54,992 --> 00:11:56,692
-Oh, that is so cool.

272
00:11:56,725 --> 00:11:58,058
Momoshiro, you rock.

273
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,392
-Call me Momo.

274
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:00,992
-Oh, I couldn't do
that, Momoshiro.

275
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:03,192
But can I be the chair judge?

276
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:06,925
-Sure, go ahead.

277
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,325
[Horio clears throat]

278
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:12,158
-Announcing today's match
between Momoshiro and Ryoma

279
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:13,758
will commence with me, Horio--

280
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:16,692
-That show-off Horio sure likes
the sound of his own big mouth.

281
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:17,592
-Mmhm.

282
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,592
Whatever, Horio.

283
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,758
Shut up and start
the match already!

284
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,425
-Um, OK.

285
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,592
This is a best of one set match.

286
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,925
Serve is Echizen.

287
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:26,792
Begin play.

288
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:37,092
HORIO: Fault.

289
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:37,725
-Yes.

290
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,025
It's all over now.

291
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,592
Ryoma wins, and he
made it look easy!

292
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,758
-Tomoka, a fault is a bad serve
that has to be taken over.

293
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:47,225
If Ryoma does it again,
Momoshiro will get the point.

294
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:48,192
-Oh, really?

295
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,525
That'd be terrible.

296
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:50,892
I couldn't stand to see that!

297
00:12:50,925 --> 00:12:53,325
-Boy, that serve was
a really fast one.

298
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:55,592
-Yeah.

299
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,492
-Forget the slice serve, kid.

300
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,492
Give me what you got.

301
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:00,725
-Sorry.

302
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:01,458
-His eyes.

303
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:02,625
He's glaring at me again.

304
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:11,158
-Kick serve.

305
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:11,725
It's coming.

306
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:40,592
[all gasp in sequence]

307
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,092
-A kick serve.

308
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,092
I can't believe it.

309
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,192
-Hey, what's so special
about the kick serve, anyway?

310
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:48,958
-The usual serve slices left.

311
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:51,258
That's because the spin is
on the outside of the ball.

312
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:52,958
But with a kick
serve, the spin is

313
00:13:52,992 --> 00:13:55,125
on the inside,
which red top spin,

314
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:56,858
making it harder to return.

315
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:58,192
-I get it.

316
00:13:58,225 --> 00:13:59,958
So if you serve just right,
you could hit your opponent

317
00:13:59,992 --> 00:14:01,692
in the head and knock him out.

318
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:05,225
-Yeah, but it's
practically impossible.

319
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:06,858
I can't believe a
middle school kid

320
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:08,592
knows how to serve like that.

321
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,592
It's fantastic.

322
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,425
-That's Ryoma.

323
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,558
He knows all the tennis tricks.

324
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:14,658
He's the coolest.

325
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:18,258
-First kick serve
I've ever seen.

326
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,158
Is that the best
that you can do?

327
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,525
I'm so worried.

328
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:22,325
-You look it.

329
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:23,358
You're sweating like a pig.

330
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:29,025
-Kid's getting on my nerves.

331
00:14:29,058 --> 00:14:29,825
-15, love.

332
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:34,492
-No one makes a fool of me.

333
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:39,425
My only chance is to catch
the ball on the rise.

334
00:14:42,325 --> 00:14:43,758
Got to charge to the net.

335
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:48,558
Back at you, hot stuff.

336
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:00,092
Heh.

337
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,025
Timing is everything when it
comes to hitting that serve.

338
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:03,158
But I'll get it.

339
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:04,158
-Poor guy.

340
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:05,692
He has no chance
against a kick serve.

341
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:07,092
Momo's doomed for sure.

342
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,325
It'll be a very
hard loss to take.

343
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:10,292
HORIO: 30, love.

344
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:11,125
Echizen leads.

345
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:25,225
-Feet, don't fail me now!

346
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,225
See that?

347
00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:37,058
Lucky shot.

348
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:38,058
That's twice.

349
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:39,958
-If he keeps that
up, he might win.

350
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:40,558
-Lucky guy.

351
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:44,558
HORIO: 30, 15.

352
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:54,158
-Sorry, kid.

353
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:57,425
I've got the timing down now.

354
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,192
No way I'll lose
in a power match.

355
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:03,425
[all gasp]

356
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,858
-[all three] He nailed it!

357
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:16,925
[Momo gasps]

358
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:22,692
[thud]

359
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:23,425
-Hmm.

360
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,658
A drop volley.

361
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:28,158
Man, you've got a whole
bag of tricks, don't you?

362
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:29,992
-40, 15.

363
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:30,558
-Go!

364
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:31,625
Get him, Ryoma!

365
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,658
Show him why you're the best!

366
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:36,825
-Hmm.

367
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:44,292
[shutter clicks]

368
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:45,958
-Just like his father.

369
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:50,258
Those eyes, that
confident glare.

370
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,458
He's like the second
coming of Nanjiro Echizen.

371
00:16:59,425 --> 00:17:02,092
[yawns]

372
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:02,792
-What's this?

373
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:04,558
No opponent?

374
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:08,792
I could have sworn I had
someone to play today.

375
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:11,125
Think I'll take a nap.

376
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:20,825
[birds chirping]

377
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:24,625
-If Ryoma wins this
point, he'll win the game.

378
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:25,458
-Shoot.

379
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:26,758
This is taking too long.

380
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:27,758
I got to finish him off.

381
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,225
-You've still got a ways to go.

382
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:46,958
-Oh, yeah.

383
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:47,492
That's right.

384
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,758
-Time out.

385
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,192
I quit.

386
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:01,825
You're way too good for me.

387
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:03,325
-Huh?

388
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:04,725
-What?

389
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:07,025
-Actually, I only wanted
to see a kick serve.

390
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:10,658
-Whatever you say.

391
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:16,858
-You were awesome.

392
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:18,258
I can't believe
he quit like that.

393
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,658
-Goofball.

394
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:21,925
Hey Echizen, where'd you learn
to do all those tennis tricks?

395
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,392
-At a temple.

396
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:25,192
-[all at once] Temple?

397
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:26,992
-Will you stop pulling my arm?

398
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:28,058
-We saw the whole match.

399
00:18:28,092 --> 00:18:29,692
I think you're the
most incredible player

400
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:30,758
I've seen in my lifetime.

401
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:33,292
I'm Tomoka, I'm Sakuno's friend.

402
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,625
-Huh?

403
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:36,625
-Good to see you again, Ryoma.

404
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,492
Thanks for the other day.

405
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:40,292
-Have we met before?

406
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:41,925
I don't remember you.

407
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,592
[Sakuno gasps]

408
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,058
-I can't believe it.

409
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:50,458
He doesn't remember me at all.

410
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:52,058
-You don't look so happy.

411
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:53,258
-Hey, grandma.

412
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:54,925
-Quitting like you
did, it's not going

413
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:58,092
to make your life any
easier around here.

414
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,858
-So maybe that's what I need.

415
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:01,258
-So nonchalant.

416
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:03,525
If you hadn't already
sprained your right ankle,

417
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:06,092
you might have won.

418
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,758
-No, I could tell
he knew about it.

419
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:09,458
He knew.

420
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:14,558
-Whatever.

421
00:19:14,592 --> 00:19:16,558
-The entire time, he was playing
with the wrong hand against me,

422
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:20,192
an upperclassman, like he
was giving me a handicap.

423
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,092
Heh, such arrogance.

424
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,125
Reminds me of me.

425
00:19:25,158 --> 00:19:29,792
[Ryuzaki chuckles]

426
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,758
-Ryoma Echizen.

427
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:33,658
What an odd little boy.

428
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:35,925
-Not so odd, not so little.

429
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,758
Let's call him Samurai Junior.

430
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,995
SHIBA: Samurai Junior?

431
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:57,360
[gong sounds]

432
00:19:57,393 --> 00:20:00,127
-Mm, very interesting.

433
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,938
I wonder where my idiot son is.

434
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:05,873
Maybe he found a girlfriend.

435
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:11,879
-Oh!

436
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,530
Now I remember.

437
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:19,494
[gong sounds]

438
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:52,725
[rock music playing]

439
00:20:53,944 --> 00:20:56,444
-Yo, I'm Satoshi
Horio, and I've been

440
00:20:56,477 --> 00:20:58,277
playing tennis for two years.

441
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,677
But man, that Echizen
is something else.

442
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,877
Even I, with my two
years experience,

443
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,444
think he's pretty amazing.

444
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:08,677
But how does he play so well
with an old, beat-up racket?

445
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,410
I can't figure it out, and I
have two years of experience.

446
00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:15,044
Next on Prince of Tennis,
the Seigaku regulars

447
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:16,477
make their debut.

448
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,244
And these guys will have
you scratching your heads.

449
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:20,644
Don't forget to watch.

450
00:21:20,677 --> 00:21:24,416
And look out for me, Horio, with
two years of tennis experience.
