1
00:00:07,476 --> 00:00:10,476
-I can't believe
it dropped so fast.

2
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:13,876
Get to it.

3
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:15,809
-He returned it!

4
00:00:15,843 --> 00:00:16,309
-Kid's fast.

5
00:00:16,343 --> 00:00:17,309
Here goes.

6
00:00:20,243 --> 00:00:21,409
-Lay off of it!

7
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:22,176
Don't smash!

8
00:00:33,543 --> 00:00:36,476
[theme music]

9
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,672
-Seigaku, fight, fight, fight!

10
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:50,906
Seigaku, fight, fight, fight!

11
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,972
Seigaku, fight, fight, fight!

12
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:58,906
-Come on!

13
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:00,439
And get those feet
off the ground.

14
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,906
-Why are we running today?

15
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,372
-They want us to train
harder for the metropolitans.

16
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:17,806
-This is way too hard.

17
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:30,172
-You're running today to build
up the strength of the team.

18
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:34,472
Whoever dropped out will be
getting my special penal-tea.

19
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:37,839
-No way!

20
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:42,539
[screaming]

21
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:47,672
-Today's penal-tea is a
brand new improved version.

22
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:48,906
Not another.

23
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:49,972
-I wanna try it.

24
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:50,839
Looks good.

25
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:51,539
-Not me.

26
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,139
No way I'll drink it.

27
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,106
I think Inui's
beginning to like making

28
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:57,639
us drink that
sewer water of his.

29
00:02:57,672 --> 00:02:58,572
Huh?

30
00:02:58,606 --> 00:02:59,972
Hey, Viper!

31
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:01,806
You can't do that!

32
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,372
-I still won't drink that junk.

33
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:14,506
-Stop there.

34
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,272
You're disqualified.

35
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:18,439
-Aw.

36
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:22,406
[screaming]

37
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,339
-The time for today
is 55 seconds.

38
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:29,639
Anyone who takes longer will
have a special penal-tea.

39
00:03:29,672 --> 00:03:30,606
-Is he kidding?

40
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,706
-It sounds like fun.

41
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:35,539
-Pick up the pace, guys.

42
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:38,306
-No way I'm ever gonna
drink that stuff!

43
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:40,306
-If you're gonna sprint
you won't last long.

44
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:41,506
-That's true.

45
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:42,572
-I'll never drink that.

46
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:46,772
-Taka, what's up?

47
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:48,239
You're awfully nonchalant.

48
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:49,706
-Nonchalant?

49
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,439
Seem to me like he's
thinking about a girl.

50
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:53,106
-A girl?

51
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,472
-Just knock it off.

52
00:03:54,506 --> 00:03:58,572
[giggling]

53
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,706
-It's stupid to talk
about such things.

54
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,739
-Don't make Yuki worry anymore.

55
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:03,706
WOMAN: Jin, stop it.

56
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:14,972
-And don't even think
about ordering me around.

57
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,539
-Takashi, are you all right?

58
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:20,206
-That's terrible.

59
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,106
[groaning]

60
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,439
-Hey, Momo, you better not.

61
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:38,772
-Huh?

62
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:50,206
-Thank you for that
treat earlier today.

63
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,781
-Seigaku.

64
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:57,239
-I haven't introduced
myself yet.

65
00:04:57,272 --> 00:05:00,572
I'm Ryouma Echizen, a
seventh grader at Seigaku.

66
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:03,406
Nice to meet you.

67
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,339
-Jin Akutsu?

68
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:07,806
-Yeah.

69
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,139
That's the guy.

70
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:11,939
He quit coming to the dojo
when he entered middle school,

71
00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:14,372
and I've only heard
bad things since.

72
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:17,206
I sure never thought that
he'd come back to play tennis.

73
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,139
-Come back?

74
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:19,439
What do you mean?

75
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:21,139
-He had the best
coach around back

76
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:23,306
when we were both in
elementary school.

77
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,406
He was really that good.

78
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,606
-Hm.

79
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,739
I'm probably just guessing,
but was the hot babe

80
00:05:28,772 --> 00:05:31,006
sitting with him
your girlfriend?

81
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,706
-Girlfriend?

82
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:33,706
-So it's true then.

83
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:34,606
-You're so wrong.

84
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,439
-Come on.

85
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:37,006
This is no time to be shy, Taka.

86
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:37,539
-Hey.

87
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:38,472
I'm not shy.

88
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,139
She's just--

89
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,306
-Don't worry, Taka.

90
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,772
Everyone goes through phases.

91
00:05:42,806 --> 00:05:43,406
-Phases?

92
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,506
What phases?

93
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:47,339
-You know, when you
fall for an older woman.

94
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,206
-Older woman.

95
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:50,072
-Shut up, will you?

96
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:51,939
-Quit it, would you?

97
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:53,239
It's our last lap.

98
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:55,372
Your pace is falling.

99
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:58,806
-In the end, only the
regulars are left.

100
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:02,906
Of course, this mug
awaits the last runner in.

101
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:06,039
A deluxe penal-tea super
special new version.

102
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:10,472
-Ugh.

103
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:12,639
That's right.

104
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:13,539
Come on, guys.

105
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:16,072
Wait for me!

106
00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:19,439
-I can't lose, no way, no how!

107
00:06:19,472 --> 00:06:20,072
-Not me either!

108
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,406
-Hey, Kawamura, your racket.

109
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:33,906
-Huh?

110
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,239
-I'm burning!

111
00:06:44,272 --> 00:06:45,772
On fire!

112
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,106
Out of my way!

113
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,006
-Huh?

114
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,706
-Raa!

115
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:50,272
[chuckling]

116
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:52,439
[angry shouting]

117
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,072
-Hey, Fuji, got a question.

118
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:02,606
-Yeah.

119
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,772
What is it?

120
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:06,106
-I thought you liked
to drink that stuff.

121
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:07,506
-Inui's penal-tea?

122
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:08,539
Yeah.

123
00:07:08,572 --> 00:07:09,772
I really think the
stuff tastes great.

124
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,639
-Then what the heck are
you running so hard for?

125
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:14,072
-Because it's fun
to watch all you

126
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:17,906
guys getting nervous over it.

127
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,306
-Man, I guess I better not
get on your bad side then.

128
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,372
-Hurry.

129
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:30,072
We're running out of time.

130
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:31,039
-On fire!

131
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:33,039
On fire!

132
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:35,506
-A little further.

133
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,472
-I'm not through yet!

134
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:42,406
-I won't give up now!

135
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:48,339
-Hm.

136
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:49,339
-Who you think won?

137
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:52,972
-What's their time?

138
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,939
-54 seconds.

139
00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:58,606
Regrettably, they
all came in together.

140
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,939
-Just watching is
making me tired.

141
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:01,672
-Man.

142
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:02,872
They ran like crazy.

143
00:08:02,906 --> 00:08:04,072
-Geez.

144
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:05,772
Do you think they're gonna
do that for every drill?

145
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:10,739
-Do you think Inui
is trying to kill us?

146
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:12,772
-I'm already dead.

147
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:13,706
-All right.

148
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:15,172
Stop the whining,
and get to work.

149
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:17,372
-Tezuka's right.

150
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:19,906
The St. Rudolph's
match was a joke.

151
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:22,872
You boys needed a
whole lot more stamina.

152
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:25,339
If we're gonna aim
for the nationals,

153
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,206
we have to toughen up.

154
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:30,272
When you're exhausted,
that's the best time

155
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:32,206
to test your true abilities.

156
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:32,939
-OK.

157
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,272
Time for practice matches.

158
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,306
I'll see all of you
guys out on the court.

159
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:36,872
-What?

160
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:38,306
Play right now?

161
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,006
Really?

162
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,472
After all that running?

163
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:42,106
-He's joking.

164
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:45,072
They can't play after
running so hard like that.

165
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:47,672
-It would be impossible.

166
00:08:47,706 --> 00:08:52,872
-Fuji, Echizen, we'll start
off with the two of you.

167
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:55,072
-A match between
Fuji and Echizen?

168
00:09:01,372 --> 00:09:02,806
-No way.

169
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:04,606
Practice matches
between the regulars?

170
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,906
-That's one amazing
match-up we get to watch.

171
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:08,706
-Who's stronger I wonder?

172
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:09,939
Fuji or Echizen?

173
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:16,972
-Now I play the big brother.

174
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:19,006
-Take it easy on me, kid.

175
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,039
-Hey, guys.

176
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:22,806
Do you think Ryouma
will be all right?

177
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,039
-Who'll win?

178
00:09:24,072 --> 00:09:24,606
-Fuji.

179
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,172
-Fuji.

180
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:25,806
-Fuji.

181
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,039
-Echizen.

182
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:28,639
-Huh?

183
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:29,139
-Ugh.

184
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,072
-Let's see how far you can
get with Fuji, Echizen.

185
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:38,939
Show him your stuff, kid.

186
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:39,939

00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:48,906
-Where the heck does Echizen
get all that stamina?

190
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:59,839
ECHIZEN (VOICEOVER): Fuji,
it's OK if I beat you, right?

191
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:04,806
-Hmph.

192
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:14,772
SATOSHI: Echizen's
rushing the net.

193
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:17,272
FUJI (VOICEOVER): Does he
plan to attack on his return?

194
00:10:17,306 --> 00:10:18,939
I'll just move him side to side.

195
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:28,672
-Not bad, But I really
want to win this,

196
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:30,639
so I've got to attack.

197
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:46,372
-That guy, he's crushing
everything that Fuji hits.

198
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:49,172
FUJI (VOICEOVER): His
shots are might fast.

199
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:53,006
Not a single sign of retreat,
He keeps hitting the balls right

200
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,606
back, and what
makes it possible is

201
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,506
that-- his one-legged
splits step.

202
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:00,639
-Wow.

203
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:03,172
That ball was supposed
to finish up the point.

204
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:03,672
Come on!

205
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:08,339

held his serve.

00:11:28,507 --> 00:11:30,507
-Ryouma still has
a chance to win.

214
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,740
RYUZAKI: Hm.

215
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,807
It looks like they're still
feeling each other out.

216
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,840
-Which of them will
set the bait first?

217
00:11:37,874 --> 00:11:38,840
That's the question.

218
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:48,674
-Whoa.

219
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:57,074
ECHIZEN (VOICEOVER): I'll
throw him off with a Drive B.

220
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,674
How about a triple counter?

221
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:01,174
-This is exciting.

222
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:02,407
What a rally!

223
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,740
Neither player's giving an inch.

224
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,440
FUJI (VOICEOVER): The
ball's speed, it changed.

225
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:12,474
ECHIZEN (VOICEOVER): Yes.

226
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:14,540
Here we go.

227
00:12:14,574 --> 00:12:15,574
-Whoa.

228
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:18,374
Echizen threw down
the gauntlet first.

229
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:20,240
FUJI (VOICEOVER): I'll
just aim for his feet.

230
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:23,674
Huh?

231
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:24,307
-Wow.

232
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,274
Ryouma's sliding!

233
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:27,774
KACHIRO AND SATOSHI:
The Drive B!

234
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:29,240
ECHIZEN (VOICEOVER): I'll
aim for the left corner.

235
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:30,240
FUJI (VOICEOVER): Oh no.

236
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:42,040
Normally, a smash from that
angle would drive the ball out,

237
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:44,540
but Echizen's Drive B
just drops suddenly.

238
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:52,407
I can't believe it
dropped so fast.

239
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,807
Get to it.

240
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,774

241
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:58,740
-The little guy's fast.

242
00:12:58,774 --> 00:12:59,440
-Here goes.

243
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:03,307
-Lay off of it!

244
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:03,907
Don't smash!

245
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:23,540
-Huh?

246
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,974

00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:34,607

KACHIRO: I don't have a clue.

250
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,240
-Wha-- wha-- he returned
that smash with a volley.

251
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:45,307
-You're right.

252
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,407
That move even destroys
the effectiveness

253
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,774
of my dunk smashes.

254
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:51,874
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER): It's
called Counter Tennis.

255
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:54,474
It uses the power
your opponent produces

256
00:13:54,507 --> 00:13:57,540
to generate more
power off your racket.

257
00:13:57,574 --> 00:14:00,940

Fuji's Triple Counters,

-That was his Brown Bear.

260
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:09,507
-He returned Ryouma's
smash head on.

261
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,807
How'd he do it?

262
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,774
-For Fuji to use that trick
means he's taking no prisoners.

263
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:19,374
-What is that Brown Bear anyway?

264
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:21,507
-The old Brown Bear.

265
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,974
He uses his body's
centrifugal force

266
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:27,974
to absorb his opponent's
power, then watch out.

267
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:32,007
He sends it back behind his
opponent who, by this time,

268
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,374
has charged forward.

269
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:34,174
SATOSHI: Sweet.

270
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,907
All in the blink of an eye.

KATSUO: That's not something
a normal person can do.

272
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:42,307
-And that is why Fuji
is such a genius.

273
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,207
FUJI (VOICEOVER): Ryouma's Drive
B is tougher than I figured.

274
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,374
I can't find a good
way to counter it

275
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:59,640
I was only able to
return it because Echizen

276
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:01,040
was tired after
all that running?

277
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:05,207
-What's up?

278
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,440
Something wrong?

279
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,074
-Just thinking.

280
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,374

that huge smash of his anymore.

281
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:19,940
-Huh?

282
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:21,274
And why is that?

Come on.

00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:23,474
Just stop to think about it.

00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,607
Echizen hit a clean
winner, but Fuji

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,674
was able to knock it
back without a problem.

287

spooked so easy?

307
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,574
Just try and defeat me.

00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:59,074
It's the one he used
against Ibu of Fudomine.

I can't lower my guard
