-Tezuka and Fuji.

2
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:11,566
So, you checking out
the competition, huh?

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,932
Figured out anything
I should know?

4
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:18,866
By the way, I hear you
didn't play against Gyokurin.

5
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,599
Is there some problem you're
not telling anybody about?

6
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:24,666
-Let's go, Fuji.

7
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,732
-Hang on!

8
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:28,199
Let me see that arm.

9
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:29,566
Maybe there's an injury?

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,899
-Let go.

11
00:00:34,932 --> 00:00:35,899
[growling]

12
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:37,266
-He didn't even flinch!

13
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:45,366
I'll get to the bottom of this
if it's the last thing I do.

00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:48,866
[theme music]

15
00:01:57,348 --> 00:02:00,981
-This is going to
be very interesting.

16
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:03,681
-I didn't realize you two belong
to the illustrious Seigaku.

17
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:05,414
It comes as a shock to me.

18
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:06,314
-That's for sure.

19
00:02:06,348 --> 00:02:07,481
We must be very lucky.

20
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:08,181
-Yeah.

21
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:09,848
What a big break for us.

22
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:14,414
If this were singles, no doubt
you'd have the advantage.

23
00:02:14,448 --> 00:02:15,314
-Probably.

24
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:17,881
-Why, you--

25
00:02:17,914 --> 00:02:20,748
-On the other hand, it
usually proves a lot more fun

26
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:24,214
to be able to beat your
opponents at their own game.

27
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:25,848
-Is that why--

28
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:27,881
---you've teamed up against us?

29
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,414
-I'm so very relieved.

30
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:33,681
This has worked out
just like we planned.

32
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:36,614
-Look, he fluffed the serve!

33
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:37,781
-I'll say he did!

34
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:38,748
-Now's your big chance!

35
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:39,514
Put it away!

36
00:02:39,548 --> 00:02:41,048
-That was deliberate.

37
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:42,148
-Hmm.

38
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:44,081
Being great at singles
doesn't necessarily

39
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:46,214
make you a doubles player.

40
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:49,614
-It's not just the strongest
who win in doubles.

41
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:51,148
-Wow, a double poach!

42
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:53,248
-With both of them
at the net, there's

43
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:55,748
no place left for
them to hit the ball!

ANNOUNCER: 30 all.

00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:07,248
-In doubles, working together
is the key to winning the game.

47
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:07,781
-Come on.

48
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:09,081
Let's do it.

49
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:11,181
-They've evened up the score.

50
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:13,248
Against Seigaku.

51
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:16,248
-Seems like they're trying
every trick in the book on us.

52
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:19,148
Even that fluff
serve had a purpose.

53
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:19,648

ANNOUNCER: Game to
Giyokuren. operation

56
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:41,448
-Oh.

57
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:46,681
-Uh, Momo, I think
you took a ball that

58
00:03:46,714 --> 00:03:47,814
should have been mine.

59
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:50,881
-No, the player in front
takes any ball he can.

60
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:53,414
-If you can't put it away,
you shouldn't try to hit it.

61
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:54,214
-What's that?

62
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:55,548
You've got a complaint?

63
00:03:55,581 --> 00:03:56,214
-Grrr!

64
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:56,948
ANNOUNCER: Seigaku!

65
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:58,381
Warning!

66
00:03:58,414 --> 00:03:59,214
-Oh, no.

67
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:00,614
They're arguing with each other.

68
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:01,981
-This isn't going well.

69
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:04,281
-Inui, is there any
chance that Ryoma and Momo

70
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:05,448
can turn the match around?

71
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:07,948
-Against a polished team
like Izumi and Fukawa,

72
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,148
only a coordinated
team can triumph.

73
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:13,981
So unfortunately, right
now, I'd say, not a chance.

-Oh, boys.

77
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:29,981
What was that about?

78
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:32,448
-But Coach, I'm not
used to playing doubles.

79
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,348
Can't you see those
guys have our number

80
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:35,648
and they're killing us?

81
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:37,781
-It's not our opponents
who are beating us.

82
00:04:37,814 --> 00:04:40,614
Unfortunately, I think
we're beating ourselves.

83
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:43,514
-You really think so?

84
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:44,381
-You saw it.

85
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:47,148
They got you all confused, Momo.

86
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:50,348
-If you're trying to say it's
all my fault, I don't think so.

87
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:52,648
Look, punk, you're the one
who's hogging all the balls.

88
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:54,514
You're nothing but
a rookie ball hog.

89
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:57,848
-You were going for balls on
my side of the court, jerk.

90
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,481
-Not me.

91
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,648
You are so wrong.

92
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:00,781
-Stop it, you two.

93
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:01,848
Enough.

-Yeah, so true.

97
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:10,914
COACH (VOICEOVER) Hmm.

98
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:12,848
You really think that
kind of trash talk

99
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,881
will affect my players?

100
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:15,748
Ha.

101
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:16,248
Huh?

102
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:17,214
-Grr.

-You're falling for it!

104

(VOICEOVER) Those two
just can't get it together

105
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:25,648
as a doubles team.

106
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:26,214
Too bad.

108
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,681
Kazuka, I think we
might have blown it.

109
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,514
-You're right.

110
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,981
-You can still do this.

111
00:05:42,014 --> 00:05:43,048
Get tough, guys.

112
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:43,581
Come on.

113
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:45,114
You can do it.

Sorry.

Sorry.

121
00:05:59,648 --> 00:06:00,281
-It's OK.

122
00:06:00,314 --> 00:06:01,448
Just shake it off.

123
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:02,414
-Oh, no.

124
00:06:02,448 --> 00:06:03,381
What a mess.

125
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:04,981
-They're no good
playing together.

126
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:05,948
Not at all.

127
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:07,281
-They're self-destructing.

128
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:09,748

-They're distracted now.

139
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:37,648
They're not concentrating
on the match.

140
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:39,648
-They've got to
pull it together.

141
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:04,548

dream team after all.

-Great minds think alike.

147
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:27,581
You were thinking the same
thing I was, weren't you?

148
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,948
-Looks that way, huh?

149
00:07:33,614 --> 00:07:36,248
Well, I suppose we shouldn't
be fighting for balls, huh?

150
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:38,181
-I'll get everything on
this side of the line

151
00:07:38,214 --> 00:07:39,114
and you get the rest.

152
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:40,548
That ought to work.

153
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,648
-Sounds like a plan.

154
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:45,648
-And don't even think about
coming on my side of the line.

155

Ha!

going to split the court!

act like our Ryoma!

-Yeah!

160
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:55,781

162
00:07:56,914 --> 00:07:58,781
They act like they're
just goofing around.

-Mine.

170
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:29,214

171
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:30,414
Right down the middle!

172
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:42,814

boys are supposed to look.

How come now they're
so much better?

-Huh?

182
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:01,914

play singles again.

00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:05,314
-Huh?

186
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:07,014
Singles?

187
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,048
-You see, if they're
both covering

188
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:13,248
the same half of the court,
they leave lots of court open.

189
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:16,281
Each one only needs to
cover one half the court.

190
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:19,314
So Momo and Echizen
split the court and each

191
00:09:19,348 --> 00:09:22,248
played their singles game
on his half of the court.

192
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:24,048
That way, they're
free from worrying

193
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:25,781
about each other's
positions, and they

194
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:28,214
can concentrate on winning.

195
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:29,281
-Brilliant.

196
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:31,514
-It's probably not
the best way to play,

197
00:09:31,548 --> 00:09:34,348
but I think Momo and Echizen
can definitely make it work.

198
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:39,114
(VOICEOVER) OK.

199
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:40,614
We just got a little
careless, that's all.

200
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:42,514
They're not going to
beat us just because they

201
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,114
drew a line across the court.

202
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:45,614
Huh?

203
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:51,048
OK.

204
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:53,981
We'll both rush the net.

205
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:56,948
[laughter]

206
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:04,881
-Look at that formation.

207
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:06,214
Double poach!

208
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:10,548
-Let's break these guys, now.

209
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:14,181
-When we're both at
net, no one can stop us.

210
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,114
Haha.

211
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,581
-My ball.

212
00:10:17,614 --> 00:10:19,614
-This game is way too easy.

213
00:10:19,648 --> 00:10:20,614
-Ah.

214
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:22,381
You're ball!

215
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,348
-Huh?

216
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:25,481
Echizen, you know
it's on your side.

217
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:27,781
-Don't worry, I'm all over it.

218
00:10:27,814 --> 00:10:30,048
-You can't be serious.

219
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:34,981
They're going to try to play
singles against the two of us?

220
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:35,481
Hey!

221
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:36,981
Izumi!

222
00:10:37,014 --> 00:10:38,448
-Yeah, leave it to me.

223
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:47,848
[grunting]

224
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:56,981
-And there's Momo's
overhead smash shot!

225
00:10:57,014 --> 00:11:01,848
[gasps]

226
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:02,348
-Ah!

227
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,648
[loud grunts]

228
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:10,681
-Oh, yeah.

229
00:11:10,714 --> 00:11:11,648
-It's good.

230
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:12,981
-It's not just good.

231
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:14,114
It's fantastic.

232
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:16,414
-I just knew those two
would snap out of it.

233
00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:17,848
Their opponents must be worried.

234
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:22,014
There's no doubt the boys
could dominate from here on in.

235
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,048
-Yeah!

236
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:25,381
-That team sure is
running scared now!

237
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:25,881
-Yeah!

238
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:34,914
-Did you hear?

239
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:37,648
Gyokurin's actually holding
their own against Seigaku.

240
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:39,414
-I was sure that
this year's final

241
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,714
was going to be Kakinoke
against Seigaku,

242
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,781
but then again,
maybe I was wrong.

243
00:11:43,814 --> 00:11:45,348
-You got that one right.

244
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:46,614
Haha.

245
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:50,281
It's going to be Kakinoke
versus Seigaku after all.

246
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:52,014
You can bet on it.

247
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:53,581
Ha.

248
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:55,548
-Who was that guy?

249
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,048
-Huh?

250
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:01,181
-You mean you don't know?

251
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:03,914
Kuki's some kind of legend.

252
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:06,181
He's the number one player
on the Kakinoke team.

253
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:20,596
-Double poach.

254
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,463
-That is no way to play
a doubles tennis match.

255
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:41,163
We can't let them do this.

256
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:42,096
-Let her rip.

257
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:46,696
(VOICEOVER) I can't believe it.

258
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,096
They're returning every ball,
no matter where we hit it.

259
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,030
-All right!

260
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,430
-Seigaku!

261
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:54,663
-Man, what is with these guys?

262
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:58,563
It's like they're completely
different players now.

263
00:12:58,596 --> 00:12:59,896
Izumi, let it go.

264
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,963
It's heading out of
the court for sure.

265
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:04,296
-Yeah, all right.

266
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,496
-Guess again, buddy.

267
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,830
It's going in.

268
00:13:08,863 --> 00:13:11,196
[gasps]

269
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:11,696
-Hey.

270
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,530
-Huh?

271
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:14,230
-I'm starting to like doubles.

272
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:15,730
How about you guys?

273
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:18,696
-You guys aren't even
playing a real doubles match.

274
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:22,730
-Come on, come on.

275
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:23,863
Let's do this.

276
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,663
-Let's do it, Momo.

277
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:26,763
(VOICEOVER) Man.

278
00:13:26,796 --> 00:13:29,563
No matter which way I
hit, they get to it.

279
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:31,096
Which side to go to?

280
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,030
Which side?

281
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,030
I got it!

282
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:36,996
-Smack down the middle.

283
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,696
That's exactly
where I got to go!

284
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:43,963
-Hey, what are you doing?

285
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:44,463
Ah!

286
00:13:56,296 --> 00:14:00,163
[gasping]

ANNOUNCER: Game and
match to Seigaku.

-And there's the match.

289
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,163
Our guys came through!

290
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:07,130
-That's great!

291
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:09,563
Ryoma did it!

292
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:12,496
[cheering]

293
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,063
-Hey, dude.

294
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:18,996
We totally won.

295
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,130
-Playing doubles at that.

296
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:25,030
-Those two actually
won the match.

297
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:29,063
-And they did it by only playing
doubles at the center line.

298
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:31,463
-You guys are really amazing.

299
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,863
-It's like I told you before.

300
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:34,496
We have a quick learning curve.

301
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,863
-Man, and you just don't
stop boasting, either.

302
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,730
-If you feel like
playing doubles again,

303
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:42,896
come on out to the park
and we'll play sometime.

304
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,263
-So, pal, you want to play?

305
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:44,830
-Sure.

306
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:45,396
Why not?

307
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:50,630
-Say.

308
00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:54,496
I wonder where Shiba
ran away to this time.

309
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,630
[groaning]

310
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,630
-Who cares if you won?

311
00:14:58,663 --> 00:15:00,996
How dare you play so badly?

312
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,596
Think how dumb you two
idiots made the school look.

313
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,196
-Look at that
Seigaku doubles team.

314
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,630
They won their match, and
now they're being punished.

315
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:13,430
[laughter]

316
00:15:13,463 --> 00:15:14,396
-You know what?

317
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,696
I've had it with doubles.

318
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,230
-Yeah, me too.

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,496

-Ha.

323
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,096
They're really
Seigaku's golden pair.

324
00:15:37,163 --> 00:15:39,663
-We wouldn't want you
to get it into your head

325
00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:41,863
that we play like those two.

326
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:42,730
-No sweat.

327
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:43,530
No sweat.

328
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:44,430
We'll give you the doubles.

329
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:46,830
But we'll win it in singles.

330
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:47,463
-Yeah.

331
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:49,030
Trash them in six games.

332
00:15:49,063 --> 00:15:49,530
-Right.

333
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,630
-I don't want to play.

334
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:01,596

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,663

339
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:13,296
I can still salvage one match.

340
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,763
-Hmm.

341
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:16,696
-Takashi.

342
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,363
Stay loose.

00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:19,096
-Huh?

344
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,063
-All right.

345
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:21,963
That guy looks beatable.

346
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:24,396
-N-- nice to play you.

347
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,796
(VOICEOVER) So, I guess they're
not all tough guys at Seigaku.

348
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,396
Yeah.

349
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,263
This should be easy.

350
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:31,496

00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,163

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,630
Your racket.

What a loser.

00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,163
Ha-- Huh?

361
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,630
All right!

362
00:16:47,663 --> 00:16:48,096
I'm burning!

363
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,630
On fire!

00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:06,530
Doubles, 2-0.

369
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:08,530
Singles, 3-0.

370
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:11,596
Seigaku wins all courts, 5 to 0.

371
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,463
Everyone bow.

372
00:17:13,496 --> 00:17:15,696
-Thank you.

373
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,063
-Seigaku is so strong.

374
00:17:18,096 --> 00:17:19,330
Pretty impressive.

375
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:20,296
They swept every game.

376
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,263
-What do you think's
their problem?

377
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:30,830
-They both got suspended.

378
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:32,996
Ryoma's out for the next game.

379
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,663
Moma's out the next.

380
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:35,430
-Hey.

381
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:37,930
No wonder they're sulking.

382
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:39,530
ANNOUNCER: Game and
match to Kakanoki.

383
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:49,630
-You know, you're a
really good player.

384
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:52,296
I was just a little
stronger today, that's all.

385
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:57,830
(VOICEOVER) There it is.

386
00:17:57,863 --> 00:17:59,996
Kuki's famous line.

387
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,963
He practices tennis
long and hard

388
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:05,196
against local high school
teams, and it shows.

389
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,863
It's paid off for him.

390
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:08,630
Now he's in top form.

391
00:18:08,663 --> 00:18:09,130
Hmm.

392
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:22,630
-Don't we play Mizuno Fuchi
Junior High after lunch?

393
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:24,130
-That's right.

394
00:18:24,163 --> 00:18:25,796
-Tezuka and Fuji.

395
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,363
So, you checking out
the competition, huh?

396
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:31,830
Figure out anything
I should know?

397
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:36,663
By the way, I hear you
didn't play against Gyokurin.

398
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:40,530
Is there some problem you're
not telling anybody about?

399
00:18:40,563 --> 00:18:42,363
-Let's go, Fuji.

400
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:44,163
-Hang on!

401
00:18:44,196 --> 00:18:45,496
Let me see that arm.

402
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,763
Maybe there's an injury?

403
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:51,130
-Let go.

404
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,663
-Grr.

405
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:54,063
(VOICEOVER) He
didn't even flinch.

406
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,296
I'll get to the bottom of this
if it's the last thing I do.

407
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:20,463
-Wow, did you see that?

408
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,696
ANNOUNCER: Game and
match to Fudomine.

409
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,196
-Yeah!

410
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:32,363
-Impossible.

411
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:45,430
Man, what a nightmare.

412
00:19:45,463 --> 00:19:46,663
They weren't this good.

413
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,363
-What a strange
day this has been.

414
00:19:56,296 --> 00:20:02,663
The number two seed, Kakinoke,
was upset by complete unknowns.

415
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:03,163
Fudomine.

416
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:26,905
[theme music]

417
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:00,826
-Hello.

418
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,226
I'm Inowe.

419
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:04,726
I write for a monthly
pro tennis magazine.

420
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:06,059
Wow.

421
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:09,059
This year's district tournament
had quite a few surprises.

422
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:12,493
A mysterious dark horse team,
school, Fudomine Junior High,

423
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:15,393
came out of nowhere to
beat the number-two seed.

424
00:21:15,426 --> 00:21:17,659
I wonder what's the
secret to their power.

425
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,059
Boy, my writer's curiosity
sure has been aroused.

426
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:22,393
Next on the Prince of Tennis.

427
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:24,326
The Triple Counter.

428
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,559
And don't forget to
check out Seigaku, too.
