00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:13,376
MAN: This match pits a
left against a lefty.

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,710
I wonder who will win?

3
00:00:14,743 --> 00:00:16,943
The only seventh grader in
the tournament, or the younger

4
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:19,143
brother of that
tennis genius, Fuji?

5
00:00:19,176 --> 00:00:20,510
BOY: Fuji's younger
brother, huh?

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,543
YUTA (VOICEOVER): Being
the younger brother

7
00:00:25,576 --> 00:00:30,110
of the genius, all I ever
hear about my brother.

8
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:31,943
I'm me, Yuta Fuji.

9
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:36,076
-Hey.

10
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,076
-Huh?

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,376
-I hear you're Fuji's
younger brother.

12
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,810
I wonder which of you
is the better player?

13
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:51,843
I can't wait to find out.

14
00:00:51,876 --> 00:01:51,203
[theme music]

15
00:02:04,587 --> 00:02:07,653
-I wonder which of you
is the better player?

16
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:11,287
I can't wait to find out what.

17
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,820
-Echizen is trying
to psych him out!

18
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:15,487
-That's so totally like him.

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,820
-So that's Fuji's
younger brother.

20
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:19,187
-That's what I heard, too.

21
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,753
-Did you see that?

22
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:23,520
-Messing with Yuta
like that means--

23
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:25,520
the kid's a scary rookie.

24
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:26,087
-Sure enough.

25
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:33,453
[groan]

26
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,820
-The younger brother
against Echizen.

27
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:39,420
-They don't call him the
lefty killer for nothing.

28
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:41,153
-I hear that in a
practice match he

29
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:43,420
beat Saeki, the
player from Chiba.

30
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:44,953
-Wha-- really?

31
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:48,253
-Of the 16 matches he's played
against lefties to date,

32
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:51,220
he has won all of them.

33
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,153
-Huh?

34
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:53,753
-All 16 of them?

35
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:56,320
-Why is he so good
against left handers?

36
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:58,920
INUI: Well, I hear he's
played lots of practice

37
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:00,887
matches against left handers.

38
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,020
Most players are right
handed, and they're

39
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:05,553
used to how right
handers hit the ball.

40
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:07,653
So when they play against
an occasional lefty,

41
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,653
the spin on the
ball is opposite,

42
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:12,787
which makes them
very hard to play.

43
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,053
-That's right!

44
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:16,787
It's the opposite hand,
so the spin's opposite.

45
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,287
-And that's how he practiced.

46
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,253
-Does it really make
that much difference?

47
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:23,653
-It's harder when the spin
on the serve is opposite.

48
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:26,453
Of course, you do understand
that every service game is

49
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,887
to the advantage of
the server, don't you?

50
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,987
-Yes, I know that.

51
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Especially if the player
has a strong serve.

52
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:35,287
-And at various points
during the game,

53
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,320
the serve area switch from
right to left, and back again.

54
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,653
-And--

55
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:44,220
-A right hander serving to
the right, or forehand court,

56
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:46,687
and a lefty serving
to the backhand court

57
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,853
are able to get enough
angle on their serves

58
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:51,687
to pull the receiver
way out of position.

59
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,787
It's also true that
more game points

60
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,387
are served from the backhand
court than the forehand.

61
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,687
-Really?

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,387
Then that means that a lefty
always has the advantage.

63
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,253
-Hm.

64
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:02,553
Right.

65
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:04,953
The only game points served
from the forehand court

66
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:07,187
is when the score is 40-15.

67
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,287
On the other hand, game
points from the backhand court

68
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,553
come at 40-Love,
40-30, and Advantage.

69
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,120
Three times in all.

70
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:17,353
-Oh.

71
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:19,320
-With game point being
the point to win the game

72
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:22,153
and keep the serve, it's
a very important point,

73
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:24,653
and the advantage to a
lefty is much stronger

74
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:26,087
than for a right-handed player.

75
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,420
The lefty's serve
is more effective.

76
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:30,787
-Oh, I get it.

77
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,653
-Huh?

78
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:32,520
-So that's it.

79
00:04:32,553 --> 00:04:33,187
-What was that?

80
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,220
-I get it, I think.

81
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,420
-Could you go over
that again, please?

82
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:36,920
-Hm?

83
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:37,520
Oh, OK.

84
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:38,520
Listen up.

85
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:39,320
TOMOKA: Uh-huh.

86
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:41,353
-So it is the lefty killer.

87
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:44,320
Echizen has come up against
a real hard one this time.

88
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:45,720
If only we'd known,
we would have

89
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:48,887
had him practice against
Tezuka, another lefty.

90
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,520
-So our little guy
is at a disadvantage.

91
00:04:58,387 --> 00:05:00,020
ANNOUNCER: This is
a one set match.

92
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:02,053
Fuji from St. Rudolph to serve.

93
00:05:27,587 --> 00:05:29,620
15-Love.

94
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:32,053
-Now he'll serve from
the backhand court.

95
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:32,687
Watch this.

96
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:45,153
-Ryoma!

97
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:48,687
-It looks like
Ryoma's in trouble!

98
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,720
-It's like he's confused by
an opponent he's not used to.

99
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,120
-There's no way!

100
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:58,720
I don't care if he's right or
left handed, Ryoma's gotta win!

101
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:00,153
Come on, Ryoma!

102
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:03,120
-Tomoka, quiet!

103
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:05,453
-I should have known
from Fuji's brother.

104
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:06,553
-Yeah.

105
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:08,020
Looks like my little
brother has polished up

106
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:10,953
that on the rise
shot he's so good at.

107
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:13,820
-Fuji, how can you be making
jokes at a time like this?

108
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,953
-Huh?

109
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:25,487
Did he just do an
on the rise shot?

110
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,420
What is that?

111
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,787
-Um--

112
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,587
-It's a shot hit right after
the ball bounces on the court.

113
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,520
In other words, as the ball
bounces from the court,

114
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:43,087
and before it reaches its
highest point, it's hit back.

115
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,287
That means the ball comes back
a little quicker than usual.

116
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,587
What's more, you don't
wait until the ball has

117
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,520
lost its speed, but instead
add your own force to it.

118
00:06:56,553 --> 00:06:59,053
That way, you don't give
your opponent a chance

119
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:01,253
to position himself
before the next shot,

120
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,587
and you can dominate the
match better that way.

121
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,087
That's an on the rise shot.

122
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:11,453
-Echizen!

123
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:16,387
ANNOUNCER: Game to
St. Rudolph's Fuji.

124
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,220
One game to Love.

125
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:21,220
-Oh, no!

126
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:23,653
It's early, and
Ryoma's fallen behind!

127
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:25,053
-Not good!

128
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:27,320
Just because he's a lefty, he's
causing all kinds of problems.

129
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,687
-Your feelings must be mixed.

130
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:36,087
-Why's that?

131
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:49,687
If Yuta's happy, then I'm happy.

132
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:07,287
-Looks like this is gonna be a
tough match for Echizen to win.

133
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,153
-It's a long way from that.

134
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:10,653
That guy just kept his serve.

135
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:12,487
That's all he did.

136
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,087
Now it really starts.

137
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:25,853
-Echizen is gonna use
his special serve!

138
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:34,120
-Wait.

139
00:08:34,153 --> 00:08:36,153
You mean that he's gonna hit a
kick serve with his left hand?

140
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:37,620
He usually hits
it with his right?

141
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:39,053
-Exactly.

142
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:40,120
I get it!

143
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,820
He hits a kick serve
with his right hand

144
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:43,487
when he's playing a
right handed player.

145
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,387
But this time his
opponent is a lefty.

146
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:46,887
-Oh!

147
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,387
Ha!

148
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:51,987
-There it is!

149
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,920
-A kick serve!

150
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:53,487
All right!

151
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,887
-Hm.

152
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,853
What a serve.

153
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:18,187
No matter what kind
of weird ball it is,

154
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,387
it means nothing to Yuta.

155
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:24,220
ANNOUNCER: Love-15.

156
00:09:26,787 --> 00:09:28,453
-I can't believe it.

157
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:29,353
-Wow.

158
00:09:29,387 --> 00:09:31,087
What do you call that?

159
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,687
FUJI (VOICEOVER):
Well, Yuta, I didn't

160
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,020
know you've come this far.

161
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:38,353
to be sure of catching
a ball on the rise

162
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:41,087
lessens chances for
an irregular bounce.

163
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,287
But for you to return Echizen's
kick serve so easily--

164
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,553
I'd never have imagined it.

165
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:51,420
You're not the player
you used to be.

166
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,053
I'd even call that
a Super Rising Shot.

167
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,387
-Amazing.

168
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,187
-He handled Ryoma's
kick serve like it

169
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,487
was practically nothing.

170
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,487
-This is bad.

171
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,620
St. Rudolph is
distracting the game.

172
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:11,120
-Tomo.

173
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,187
-What?

174
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,387
-Even though he won
that point, he still

175
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,700
looks really fierce and angry.

176
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:21,400
I wonder why.

177
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:32,933
YUTA (VOICEOVER): That kid--
he was just testing me.

178
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:35,567
He wanted to see what
my shot was like.

179
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,120
That he would dare hit a kick
serve just to see my shot only

180
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:53,920
proves one thing.

181
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,653
He was just testing me.

182
00:10:55,687 --> 00:11:00,487
He wanted to see what my
on the rise shot was like.

183
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,887
Just as Mizuki said, this is
a rookie to watch out for.

184
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,520
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
That's right, Yuta.

185
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:08,853
Don't let him charge the net.

186
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:11,620
His strength lies in the power
of his serve and crafting

187
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:13,253
net play.

188
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:17,687
To say nothing of his amazing
one legged split step.

189
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,420
That one's a real pain.

190
00:11:19,453 --> 00:11:23,520
But if you can handle those,
Yuta, then you won't lose.

191
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:25,953
Show him what your practice
against other lefties

192
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:27,387
counts for.

193
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,020
You show him, and then I'll
show the one you're really

194
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:36,153
after-- your brother, Shusuke,
by beating him soundly

195
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:38,553
from one end of the
court to the other.

196
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,987
MAN: He sure is
Fuji's kid brother.

197
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,920
-Huh?

198
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:51,487
So you mean he's really--

199
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,953
-Fuji's younger brother?

200
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:54,887
-That's right.

201
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,587
-Why didn't he
enroll in Seigaku?

202
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,287
-He was enrolled here
for a little while.

203
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,420
-Huh?

204
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,853
But he transferred out
after about six months.

205
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:05,320
-So then he was on the
tennis team, right?

206
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:06,087
-No.

207
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,587
-Huh?

208
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,053
-Why not?

209
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:24,387
-Probably because he didn't want
to be compared to the brother

210
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,920
everyone calls the genius.

211
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:33,220
-Ryoma's gonna try to
hit another kick serve.

212
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,953
-But it didn't work last time.

213
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:38,153
-Maybe he's just being stubborn.

214
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:40,853
-Because the timing to hit
a rising shot is quicker,

215
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:42,520
it feels like the
ball comes back to you

216
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,253
almost as soon as you hit it.

217
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:46,753
-And that means the kid doesn't
have time to get to the net,

218
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:48,087
sure enough.

219
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,620
-If he doesn't
get up to the net,

220
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:52,487
then like before, he'll have
to play from the baseline.

221
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,253
-Yeah.

222
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:56,287
This is bad, sure enough.

223
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,920
-Eiji, why are you
talking like that?

224
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:01,520
-Huh?

225
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:02,487
-Yeah.

226
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,420
I don't think I like
it, sure enough.

227
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:10,953
YUTA (VOICEOVER): No
matter how often you do it,

228
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:12,153
it won't matter.

229
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:14,920
my Rising Shot kills any
spin you put on the ball.

230
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:18,820
Huh?

231
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:25,220
What the--

232
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:38,987
-That was fast.

233
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,687
-I've never seen such speed.

234
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,453
ANNOUNCER: 15-All.

235
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,353
-Oh, come on, now.

236
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:52,953
Is that all you have?

237
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:58,020
I've played better lefties than
you without breaking a sweat.

238
00:13:58,053 --> 00:14:00,287
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER): He's
faster than when he played me,

239
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,587
that's for sure.

240
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,353
And getting faster all the time.

241
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,987
YUTA (VOICEOVER):
Better lefties than me?

242
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,720
Don't kid me.

243
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:17,120
-He did it!

244
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:18,087
-He won another one!

245
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:26,087
ANNOUNCER: Game to
Seigaku's Echizen.

246
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,020
One game all.

247
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:28,987
-All right.

248
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,487
He caught up in the
blink of an eye.

249
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,920
-That's our Ryoma!

250
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:37,387
-Looks like he's lost the
uncertainties in his game

251
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,853
from the district matches.

252
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,487
-That seventh
grader from Seigaku.

253
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,720
What a comeback.

254
00:14:49,753 --> 00:14:52,053
-Don't write off the eight
grader from St. Rudolph's

255
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:53,520
just yet.

256
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:54,620
-What?

257
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:56,853
The kid brother of that
Seigaku player Fuji?

258
00:14:56,887 --> 00:14:58,320
-Seigaku player Fuji?

259
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:00,187
-The one they call genius?

260
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,253
His brother?

261
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:03,553
-Well, they do have
the same last name.

262
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:04,687
-What?

263
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,087
Don't tell me you didn't
know they were related.

264
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,587
-Related?

265
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,353
Really?

266
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:08,420
BOY: His kid brother, huh?

267
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:09,120
BOY: Oh, wow.

268
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:10,553
I've heard of this guy.

269
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:12,520
He must be really, really good.

270
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,520
-Yuta's not finished yet.

271
00:15:23,553 --> 00:15:24,220
-Mm-hm.

272
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:25,953
-He hates to be a loser.

273
00:15:25,987 --> 00:15:26,587
Always has.

274
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,487
MAN: Boy, that kid is amazing.

275
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,620
MAN: He's got the lefty
killer on the ropes.

276
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:24,587
YUTA (VOICEOVER): Right.

277
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,120
This is no time to
let my guard down.

278
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:32,287
There's something I have to do.

279
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,653
When I enrolled at
Seigaku last year,

280
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:42,087
all I ever heard was
talk about my brother.

281
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,453
I was sick of it.

282
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:46,120
So sick of all those voices.

283
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:47,887
So I didn't join the
tennis team there,

284
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,353
but instead started
taking lessons

285
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:52,653
at a tennis school
some distance away.

286
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:57,787
My goal was to become a
better player than anyone.

287
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:14,953
-One of the members of our
team couldn't make it today,

288
00:17:14,987 --> 00:17:17,387
so would you care to join us?

289
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:17,920
-Yeah.

290
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,620
I'd be glad to.

291
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:20,820
-That's just great.

292
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:22,753
After all, I know he's
a pretty good player.

293
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:25,053
He's the kid brother of
Seigaku's genius Fuji--

294
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:25,553
-Coach.

295
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:30,020
MIZUKI: Is that so?

296
00:17:30,053 --> 00:17:35,887
Well, more importantly, your on
the rise shot is really great.

297
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,620
I was impressed.

298
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,987
-Th-- Uh.

299
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,220
Uh, thank you.

300
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:48,020
BOY: I've heard of
Seigaku, sure enough.

301
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:49,687
-They're the toughest
school in the area.

302
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,987
-Did we play them in
the district matches?

303
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,520
Ha.

304
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:53,320
Oh well.

305
00:17:53,353 --> 00:17:55,420
It doesn't matter.

306
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:57,253
-Huh?

307
00:17:57,287 --> 00:18:00,920
-Oh, we forgot to
introduce ourselves to you.

308
00:18:00,953 --> 00:18:03,553
The three of us will be playing
for the St. Rudolph tennis

309
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:05,453
team starting this autumn.

310
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:06,753
-This autumn?

311
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:08,087
What does that mean?

312
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,387
MIZUKI: They're recruiting
strong players from all over.

313
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,853
They're aiming to
win the nationals.

314
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,753
-You're really good.

315
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:22,620
I haven't lost this badly
since I played my brother.

316
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:24,287
Uh, I mean--

317
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,153
-No, I should say the same.

318
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:28,287
If you had perfected
that on the rise shot,

319
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,820
I would've been in trouble.

320
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:32,953
You've still a ways
to go yet, but you've

321
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,487
got lots of potential.

322
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,453
I can't believe you're buried
in a place like this, Yuta.

323
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,953
-Huh?

324
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,987
Uh, I wanna know more!

325
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,320
Yeah.

326
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:53,353
Please, tell me more
about St. Rudolph.

327
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,953
I want people to remember
my name for what I do.

328
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:05,353
That's what I've
been working on,

329
00:19:05,387 --> 00:19:11,020
and this-- this is my answer.

330
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:12,353
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER): Do it, Yuta.

331
00:19:18,153 --> 00:19:20,153
SHUSUKE (VOICEOVER): What
kind of stance is that?

332
00:19:23,753 --> 00:19:25,253
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Now you show them

333
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:28,287
the special shot
that I taught you.

334
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,687
Do it in front of everyone.

335
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,553
-Huh?

336
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:42,987
SHUSUKE (VOICEOVER):
What was that?

337
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:55,187
-Whoa, what kind
of shot was that?

338
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,253
-It was a shot with
an opposite spin.

339
00:19:57,287 --> 00:20:00,087
-Wowie.

340
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,587
-Wow.

341
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:06,053
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Did you see it?

342
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:09,520
That was Yuta's twist spin shot.

343
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:25,615
[theme music]

344
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:02,781
YUTA: I'm St. Rudolph
eighth grader Yuta Fuji.

345
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:04,581
I've been playing
tennis for years

346
00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:06,515
just so I could beat my brother.

347
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:09,015
But now, the Seigaku
seventh grader

348
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:11,481
thinks he can beat
my twist spin shot?

349
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:12,681
Ha!

350
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:15,548
And he says he's played
stronger lefties than me?

351
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:16,981
Who's he kidding?

352
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:20,915
Brag all you want after
you've defeated me.

353
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:24,081
Next on "The Prince
of Tennis," Drive B.
