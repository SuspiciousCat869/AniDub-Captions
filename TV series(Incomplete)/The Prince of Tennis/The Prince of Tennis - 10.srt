1
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:09,552
-This can't be happening.

2
00:00:09,586 --> 00:00:12,155
-There isn't a ball that you
can hit that I can't return,

3
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:14,290
young one.

4
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:15,058
-Ha!

5
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:16,226
Serves you right, kid.

6
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:18,127
You're not going up
against just anyone.

7
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:21,264
My dad was called the Golden
Retriever of Meguro

8
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:22,665
-Did he say golden?

9
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:23,533
-Retriever?

10
00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:29,506
[theme music]

11
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,102
Your dad's
amazing, Kachiro.

12
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:47,670
And what a life.

13
00:01:47,703 --> 00:01:49,839
Getting to work at a
great club like this.

14
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:51,540
-Aw, come on, guys.

15
00:01:51,574 --> 00:01:52,074
It's nothing.

16
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:53,209
He's just the coach.

17
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:56,979
-Hey!

18
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:58,581
Wait up for us, guys.

19
00:01:58,614 --> 00:01:59,949
Sorry we're late.

20
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:01,484
Did you wait long?

21
00:02:01,517 --> 00:02:03,786
-Tomoka, What's that
you're carrying?

22
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,221
-The lunch I made.

23
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:06,655
-Lunch?

24
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,924
-You're not gonna eat all
that by yourself, are you?

25
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:09,959
-Are you kidding?

26
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:11,594
I brought enough for everyone.

27
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:14,497
There's a lot of
kids in my family,

28
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,499
so I'm used to doing this.

29
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:17,833
-So, Ryoma.

30
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:19,135
Practice as hard
as you can, then

31
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:23,639
eat lots and lots of this
food I lovingly made for you!

32
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,942
I worked really hard for a
whole week figuring out a menu,

33
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:28,511
and I know you're gonna like it.

34
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:30,479
It tastes good, ask my brothers.

35
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:32,815
-Who told them that we
were gonna come here?

36
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:33,983
-Don't know.

37
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:35,484
-I did.

38
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,553
It's more fun with
a big group, right?

39
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:38,554
-Ugh.

40
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:40,055
-Momo said he'd be
joining us later.

41
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:41,056
-What?

42
00:02:41,056 --> 00:02:43,192
Momo's coming over here as well?

43
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:44,627
-And that's not all, either.

44
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:46,695
-Is there anyone
you didn't invite?

45
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:47,596
-Kachiro!

46
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,765
-Oh, hi, dad.

47
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:51,167
-I'm so glad you could all come.

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,535
-Nice to meet you.

49
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:53,169
-Hello.

50
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:55,037
-So, you're Ryoma?

51
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:57,039
My son's told me all about you.

52
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,008
He says you're
really quite good.

53
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,176
-Well, uh--

54
00:03:00,176 --> 00:03:02,645
-I want you all
to have fun today.

55
00:03:02,645 --> 00:03:04,480
Follow me, and I'll
show you to the courts.

56
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:11,153
-I see.

57
00:03:11,187 --> 00:03:12,188
How interesting.

58
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:13,989
-Uh, uncle.

59
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:15,257
-Huh?

60
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,792
Do you want something?

61
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:19,161
-You and those awful
magazines again.

62
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:20,629
Here.

63
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,498
Auntie wants you to get up
and take this right to Ryoma

64
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:23,465
without delay.

65
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:24,733
-Ah, get real.

66
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:27,570
Do I look like I'm
Ryoma's messenger boy?

67
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:29,772
-Auntie had
another message for you.

68
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:32,074
If you don't get this
lunch box to Ryoma by noon,

69
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:35,177
she's going to throw out
all of your girly magazines.

70
00:03:35,177 --> 00:03:36,212
-What?

71
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:37,179
She wouldn't!

72
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:39,048
She couldn't do
something like that!

73
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:40,983
She really did throw
them out the last time.

74
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:42,785
I am so out of here!

75
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:47,656
-You kids can
use this court.

76
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,824
Yes!

77
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:51,060
It's great to be able to
play on such a cool court.

78
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:54,163
-But please don't interfere with
any of our other guests, OK?

79
00:03:54,196 --> 00:03:55,130
Hey, Echizen.

80
00:03:55,164 --> 00:03:56,732
Teach us that kick
serve, will you?

81
00:03:56,765 --> 00:03:58,133
-No way.

82
00:03:58,167 --> 00:03:59,101
-Hey, Ryoma!

83
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:01,637
Go for it!

84
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,771
-Excuse me, Coach Kato?

85
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:03,872
-Yes?

86
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:05,708
-I'm looking forward
to a good lesson today.

87
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:07,643
-Certainly, Mr. Sasabe.

88
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:09,511
Please wait for me
over by Court F.

89
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:10,779
-What do you mean?

90
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:12,648
Why can't we stay
here on Court A?

91
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:13,949
There's nothing wrong with it.

92
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:15,618
Why do we have to
walk all the way over

93
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:17,052
to Court F for the lesson?

94
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:18,520
We'll play right here.

95
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,189
That settles it.

96
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:21,890
Take that back to the locker.

97
00:04:21,924 --> 00:04:23,792
See that you treat it with care.

98
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:27,062
Don't put it on the
floor or it'll get dirty.

99
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:28,797
-Who was that rude man?

100
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:31,133
He's one of our
regular customers.

101
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,901
He's very selfish
and unpleasant.

102
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:35,037
-We can move to
Court F if you want.

103
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:38,207
-No, I'll just give
him a piece of my mind.

104
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,577
-Hey, hurry it up, will you?

105
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,845
-What a meanie.

106
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:45,080
-Yeah, acts like
he's real tough.

107
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:47,182
-I don't think I
like him very much.

108
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:48,150
-Be right back.

109
00:04:51,186 --> 00:04:53,188
-I was sure he was
gonna tell him off.

110
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:54,523
-I'm sorry.

111
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:56,859
Maybe it'd be better if
we all move to Court F.

112
00:04:56,892 --> 00:04:57,893
-Don't worry about it.

113
00:04:57,926 --> 00:04:59,228
-People are like that.

114
00:04:59,461 --> 00:04:59,895
It's common.

115
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,941
-Hey, out of my way!

116
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:19,715
-That hurt!

117
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:22,518
Why don't you watch where
you're going, old man?

118
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:23,052
-Give me a break.

119
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:24,186
I'm in a hurry, kid.

120
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:26,121
So get out of my way, OK?

121
00:05:26,155 --> 00:05:27,022
-Huh?

122
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:29,058
After banging into me?

123
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:29,825
No way.

124
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:31,694
-Get out of my way!

125
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:32,961
-Keep dreaming.

126
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:34,163
-Look here.

127
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:36,632
A young man like you shouldn't
be riding a bike anyway.

128
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:38,801
You should be training
your body and your mind.

129
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,135
-Listen, old man.

130
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:41,904
You're going to regret that.

131
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:43,639
You can't talk to me
like that and think

132
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:46,575
you're going to
get away with it.

133
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:47,810
Listen to what I'm saying!

134
00:05:47,843 --> 00:05:48,777
-Shut up.

135
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:50,512
-Crazy old man.

136
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:51,480
-Move it.

137
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:51,955
Move it.

138
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:52,881
Move it.

139
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,794
-I can watch Ryoma play all day.

140
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:12,801
-Echizen.

141
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:13,502
Oh.

142
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:14,103
Time for a break.

143
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:14,770
Oh man.

144
00:06:14,803 --> 00:06:15,504
I can't take it.

145
00:06:15,537 --> 00:06:17,106
I'm exhausted.

146
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:19,742
-You talk big, but
you sure lack stamina.

147
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:21,076
-You're right?

148
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,045
-You're so cool, Ryoma!

149
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:25,647
Hey, Sakuno, you're
always prompt,

150
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:26,882
but you were really late today.

151
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:27,516
How come?

152
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:28,083
-Huh?

153
00:06:28,117 --> 00:06:29,952
There was no reason why.

154
00:06:29,985 --> 00:06:31,153
I was just late.

155
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:31,787
-Hm.

156
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,522
Sounds fishy.

157
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:34,656
Oh, what's in the bag?

158
00:06:34,656 --> 00:06:36,225
Let's take a look.

159
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:37,192
I wanna see it!

160
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:37,793
-Whoa.

161
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:38,594
Stop it.

162
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:39,228
Hey, don't look in there.

163
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:39,995
-I knew it.

164
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:40,629
Lunch for two.

165
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:41,764
I get it.

166
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:43,799
You were late because
you were making this.

167
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:44,633
Who's it for?

168
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,868
Ryoma?

169
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:46,568
-Oh, no.

170
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:47,169
It's, um--

171
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:47,970
-Come on.

172
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:48,771
You can tell me.

173
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:49,204
Horio?

174
00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:49,838
Kachiro?

175
00:06:49,872 --> 00:06:50,321
Katsuo?

176
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,077
-Hm?

177
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,179
-Hey, don't worry about it.

178
00:06:57,212 --> 00:07:02,951
This means Ryoma's fan club's
gonna grow by one more person.

179
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:03,786
MR. SASABE: What?

180
00:07:03,786 --> 00:07:04,920
You refuse to listen to me?

181
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:05,921
-Huh?

182
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:06,889
What was that?

183
00:07:06,922 --> 00:07:08,590
-It was a voice.

184
00:07:08,624 --> 00:07:10,926
It came from Court
A. Let's go see.

185
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:12,094
-That's enough.

186
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,497
We can't keep
doing this all day.

187
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:16,765
Enough of these warm ups.

188
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:19,868
We didn't come here just so
you could watch us exercise.

189
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:21,603
-But if you don't
warm up properly,

190
00:07:21,637 --> 00:07:24,573
it could lead to pulled muscles,
or possibly even more serious

191
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:25,174
injuries.

192
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:25,908
-What?

193
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:27,576
He's gotta be kidding.

194
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:30,078
-Look here, we're grown men,
so don't lump us together

195
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:31,180
with those other weaklings.

196
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:37,019
-It's Mr. Sasabe and his gang.

197
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:38,220
-He thinks he owns the courts.

198
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:39,788
Someone should stop him.

199
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:42,858
-Coach Kato, I may not
look it, but I made it

200
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:44,927
to the Inter High championships.

201
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,463
Consider that when you
coach me, will you?

202
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:48,630
-Of course.

203
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,066
But I must warn you about
not warming up properly.

204
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:52,067
-Oh yeah?

205
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,702
You charge us such
high tuition fees,

206
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:55,604
but you're not gonna
teach us anything.

207
00:07:55,637 --> 00:07:57,506
Forget the boring,
small stuff, coach.

208
00:07:57,506 --> 00:07:59,174
We wanna learn how
to do dynamic things,

209
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,876
like putting top
spin on the ball.

210
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:03,145
Show us how the pros
do it, Coach Kato.

211
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:05,914
Show us the top spin.

212
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:08,016
-Uh--

213
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,751
-That old man didn't
come here to learn.

214
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:10,886
Listen to him.

215
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,654
He's just trying to cause
trouble for Coach Kato.

216
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:13,922
He's just a big old pest.

217
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:16,191
-You don't know how
to do it, do you?

218
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:18,093
I heard you didn't
turn pro because you

219
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:20,629
had some kind of injury,
but it was probably

220
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:24,733
because all you ever
could do was warm ups.

221
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:26,935
-That's a terrible thing to say.

222
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:32,007
-My son told me your son plays
on the Seigaku tennis team.

223
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,209
But knowing that
it's your son, he'll

224
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:36,845
probably spend three
years chasing balls.

225
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,647
It must be hard
having no talent.

226
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:45,020
I hear they're using a
seventh grader as a regular.

227
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:47,856
Seigaku sure has
fallen on hard times.

228
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,624
Ha.

229
00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:49,691
-Wait a second, Ryoma.

230
00:08:55,764 --> 00:08:58,667
-Mr. Sasabe, you can say
whatever you want about me,

231
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,537
but I won't allow you to
criticize my son or his school

232
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,638
in any way.

233
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:04,773
Do you understand that?

234
00:09:04,773 --> 00:09:07,075
-Now, really, is that any way
to treat a paying customer?

235
00:09:09,745 --> 00:09:11,547
I guess he can't take a joke.

236
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:17,152
-Hey, dad.

237
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:17,853
What's up?

238
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:19,187
What are you doing?

239
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:20,923
-Oh, well, we're
trying to learn tennis,

240
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:23,959
but this coach
refuses to teach us.

241
00:09:23,992 --> 00:09:27,095
-Sounds like he's being
a real pain in the beck.

242
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:28,931
-Oh, I know him.

243
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:29,631
-Huh?

244
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:32,067
Are you sure?

245
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,835
-Wait a minute, Ryoma.

246
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:35,137
-Lose the coach, dad.

247
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,740
With your talent, you don't
need any lessons from anybody.

248
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:40,943
-Well, it's a sure
thing I'm a better

249
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:42,978
player than he'll ever be.

250
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:44,012
-Hey.

251
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:45,614
Have you learned how
to grip a racket?

252
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:46,982
How to grip it properly.

253
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:50,085
Do you know how?

254
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:51,019
-Huh?

255
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:52,154
-Someone you know?

256
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:54,890
-No, I've never seen
him before in my life.

257
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:57,059
-Hey you over there.

258
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:59,628
Do you wanna teach
me how to play?

259
00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:02,731
-You want me to teach you
the fundamentals of the game?

260
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:05,033
-Dad, you better not
try and teach that kid.

261
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,201
-What are you saying?

262
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:07,936
That boy can't learn
anything from that coach,

263
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,173
so he's depending
on me to teach him.

264
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:13,175
All right, I'll teach
you how to play.

265
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:15,477
I'll show you the
beautiful techniques

266
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,080
that made me runner up
at the Inter High finals.

267
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:26,555
-I don't think this
is a good thing.

268
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:31,560
-Go easy on me.

269
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:42,924
-I wonder if uncle has
met up with Ryoma yet.

270
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,095
-Let me past, brat.

271
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:48,570
-Shut up, you lazy monk.

272
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,571
-Lazy monk?

273
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:51,573
I'm a worldly monk!

274
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:52,441
-Oh, yeah?

275
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,509
Well, you know what I think?

276
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,210
I think you're just
a plain old goofball.

277
00:10:55,244 --> 00:10:56,412
Look at these abs.

278
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:57,913
Aren't they magnificent?

279
00:10:57,946 --> 00:11:00,049
I'm practically
a regular Adonis.

280
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:01,450
-Why, you little twerp.

281
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,887
Look at this miraculous body!

282
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,361
WOMAN: Hello?

283
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:06,288
Excuse me?

284
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:07,056
-Hm?

285
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:09,558
-Please, let me through.

286
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:12,494
What are Momo and
Nanjiro doing here?

287
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:15,497
Hey, what's going on?

288
00:11:15,531 --> 00:11:16,432
Oh, dear.

289
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:17,566
What's wrong?

290
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:18,534
I'm in a hurry.

291
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:19,635
Would you please
move out of the way?

292
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:21,036
-Look here, we're busy, woman.

293
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:22,571
So stay out of our way.

294
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:23,505
-What?

295
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,574
How dare you talk
to me that way.

296
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:28,310
It's downright harassment,
and highly insulting.

297
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:30,412
-This is between us men.

298
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:32,381
-So women we can
stay out of it!

299
00:11:32,414 --> 00:11:33,215
-What?

300
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:34,183
How dare you.

301
00:11:34,316 --> 00:11:36,585
That is discrimination
against women.

302
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:39,121
I demand that you take
that back right now!

303
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:40,222
-Shut up.

304
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,458
I don't care what you have
to say, so get lost.

305
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:43,992
-Forget this, let me through.

306
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:45,394
-No, let me through!

307
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:49,631
-Best of one set match.

308
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:50,899
Echizen's Service.

309
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:54,169
-Ryoma.

310
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:55,037
-Go, Ryoma!

311
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,439
Beat that terrible old guy!

312
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,475
-Hey. Better go easy on him
now, or he'll cry.

313
00:12:00,075 --> 00:12:03,479
-Yeah, he' just just a kid.

314
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:04,646
Don't be afraid, kid.

315
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,415
Just give it all you got.

316
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:09,051
-You really believe
Ryoma can handle him?

317
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:10,152
-Just watch, Dad.

318
00:12:10,185 --> 00:12:11,987
Ryoma can do amazing things.

319
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:17,292
-Right hand.

320
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:19,027
-There you go!

321
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:20,429
Those are good hit, kid.

322
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:22,431
Now see if you can do
it again even harder.

323
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:27,469
Don't hold back.

324
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:28,971
You've got to come
at me with all you got

325
00:12:29,004 --> 00:12:33,175
if you want to play
this game as well as I do.

326
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,110
-I don't understand
why Ryoma didn't

327
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:36,445
use his kick serve on him.

328
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:37,880
-I think I know.

329
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:39,081
-Huh?

330
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:42,017
-He's using a very
intelligent strategy.

331
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,020
That's why he started off
using a regular serve.

332
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:46,989
No matter how good
a player he is,

333
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:50,526
he can't win without gathering
information about his opponent.

334
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,062
That's what he's doing
now, gathering information.

335
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:56,532
That Ryoma's really
something else.

336
00:12:56,565 --> 00:13:00,435
-Of course, after all he
is a regular on Seigaku team.

337
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:02,571
-That's nothing for you
to be bragging about .

338
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:10,479
-He sent that ball
right in the corner!

339
00:13:10,512 --> 00:13:13,949
-Don't take me lightly!

340
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:14,650
Not bad.

341
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:16,018
-This world's not that easy.

342
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:19,955
Love, 15, kid.

343
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:25,961
-All right! Way to go Dad.

344
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:28,363
Tomo, did you see that?

345
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:31,300
Oh, nevermind, he was
just lucky with that shot.

346
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,368
The old man is going to be
out of breath soon enough.

347
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:36,505
-Don't worry about
anything, kid.

348
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:37,372
I'll keep training ya.

349
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:37,940
Now, serve!

350
00:13:44,313 --> 00:13:45,981
-Yes!

351
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:47,916
I bet he won't be able
to return that ball.

352
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:54,022
-There, Love-30.

353
00:13:57,492 --> 00:13:59,328
-What's going on with him?

354
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:02,164
- They call him the retriever.

355
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:03,265
The retriever?

356
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:06,935
-Hahaha

357
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:08,904
Ok, kid... let's see if you
can get past this test.

358
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:13,575
-You know what a golden
retriever is, right?

359
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:16,979
A retriever's a type
of dog used by hunters.

360
00:14:17,012 --> 00:14:17,579
-Hunting dog?

361
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:18,580
-Yes.

362
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:20,582
Someone who can
catch up to any ball

363
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:23,352
and return it back on to
the court like a hunting dog

364
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:24,920
is called a retriever.

365
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:28,223
The great champion
Bjourn Borg was known

366
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:29,625
as the world's greatest
retriever.

367
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:31,260
-This can't be happening.

368
00:14:31,293 --> 00:14:32,928
Oh, boy.

369
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:36,231
-He was the second place winner
in the inter-high championship

370
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:38,367
so he's not just
boasting.

371
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,102
Haha. There isn't a ball that
you can hit,

372
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:42,037
that I can't return, young one.

373
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,574
Ha. Serves you right kid.
You're not going up against
just anyone.

374
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:49,177
My dad was called the golden
retriever of Meguro.

375
00:14:49,311 --> 00:14:51,146
Did he say golden?

376
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:52,447
-Retriever?

377
00:14:55,617 --> 00:14:56,952
He's golden alright.

378
00:14:58,387 --> 00:15:01,023
That gold tooth's sort
of blinding me.

379
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:04,559
Save comments like that until
after you win a point. Kid!

380
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,994
Oh Yeah?

381
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:12,634
He really is a retriever!

382
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:15,304
He's keeping up with all
the balls that are hit.

383
00:15:15,304 --> 00:15:18,573
-There's something
strange about Ryoma.

384
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:19,441
-What?

385
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:20,642
-Ryoma has the serve.

386
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:22,411
He could use his
kick serve to ace it.

387
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:25,981
But for some reason,
he's just not using it.

388
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:27,349
I don't understand why?

389
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,189
-He's going to the net.

390
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:37,125
He's planning to end it.

391
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:37,893
-Ha.

392
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:40,062
You took my little bait.

393
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:42,964
Here it goes!

394
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:43,432
-Huh?

395
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:48,570
-That's a passing shot.

396
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,038
-That's it.

397
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:52,908
Retriever stays close to his
baseline returning every ball.

398
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,576
Then, when his opponent
approaches the net,

399
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:57,112
he fools them with
a passing shot.

400
00:15:57,145 --> 00:16:00,182
-It's not like Ryoma to
drop is service game.

401
00:16:00,182 --> 00:16:04,119
-Game count, one game to Love.

402
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:08,924
The Golden Retriever of
Meguro, AKA Sasabe, leads.

403
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:11,259
-Can't believe I was
so worried about this.

404
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:12,060
Come on, dad.

405
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:15,864
You can smash him!

406
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:17,265
-Guess it's about time now.

407
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:28,643
-Look at that.

408
00:16:28,877 --> 00:16:29,978
Ryoma's perspiring.

409
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:31,146
-What's the matter with him?

410
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:33,281
Why doesn't he win?

411
00:16:33,315 --> 00:16:35,183
COACH (VOICEOVER): So
that's what he's doing.

412
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:36,952
I get it.

413
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:40,188
-Here it comes.

414
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:41,123
Foolish little boy.

415
00:16:41,156 --> 00:16:42,357
I'll make you feel the power.

416
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:58,407
RYOMA: Love-15.

417
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,976
[cheering]

418
00:17:03,645 --> 00:17:05,514
-What's with this kid?

419
00:17:05,547 --> 00:17:08,116
-Ryoma wasn't just analyzing
his opponent's game.

420
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,187
He was actually warming up while
he was playing against him.

421
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:13,488
Look at how he's sweating.

422
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:15,991
His engine is running
at full speed.

423
00:17:16,024 --> 00:17:18,994
He was warming up while grasping
the Retriever's style of play.

424
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:19,995
Amazing.

425
00:17:27,335 --> 00:17:29,337
-So that's why he didn't
use the kick serve.

426
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:31,106
-Man.

427
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:32,541
I guess practicing
with us doesn't

428
00:17:32,574 --> 00:17:35,444
count when it comes
to warming him up.

429
00:17:35,477 --> 00:17:37,045
MR. RETRIEVER
(VOICEOVER): I was too

430
00:17:37,078 --> 00:17:39,448
relaxed because I thought
he was just a kid.

431
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:40,382
-Hey, mister.

432
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:41,883
You've been hugging the
baseline all this time

433
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,084
like you were scared.

434
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:44,052
-What?

435
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:46,521
-You should come to
the net more often.

436
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:47,289
-Shut up.

437
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:51,460
-Hey Mr. Retriever.

438
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:53,228
Seems to me you stay
behind the baseline

439
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:54,529
because you can't
take the front.

440
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:55,530
Isn't that right?

441
00:17:55,564 --> 00:17:56,131
-Huh?

442
00:17:56,164 --> 00:17:57,032
-Oh, no.

443
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,166
He figured it out.

444
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:01,403
-Oh no.

445
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:08,276
-Still got a ways to go.

446
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:21,323
Game to Echizen.

447
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,427
-Ow!

448
00:18:25,427 --> 00:18:26,294
-Hey dad.

449
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:27,496
Are you all right?

450
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:30,232
-I pulled a muscle.

451
00:18:30,265 --> 00:18:33,902
-You pulled a muscle because
you didn't warm up properly.

452
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:37,038
Maybe that's why you didn't
win at the Inter High level.

453
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:39,174
Father and son should
learn the basics again.

454
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:41,142
-Father and son?

455
00:18:41,176 --> 00:18:41,633
-A-OK?

456
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,916
-No wonder you're a
Seigaku regular, Ryoma.

457
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,351
Thank you.

458
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:51,953
-Seigaku regular?

459
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:54,289
-Don't tell me he's the
freshman who made the team?

460
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:00,629
-We're out of here.

461
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:03,598
[laughter]

462
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:08,003
-Come on, come on.

463
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:10,605
Would you hurry up and
move your bicycle?

464
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:12,040
-Shut up, old man.

465
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:13,174
You move.

466
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,076
-You're the one
who's in the way!

467
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,914
-If I don't get past this,
all my treasures will be lost!

468
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:21,082
-Your treasures?

469
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:21,550
-Mm.

470
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,250
Delicious.

471
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:23,318
Mm.

472
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:24,386
This is great Tomoka

473
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,556
KACHIRO: Wow, you're
a terrific cook.

474
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:29,157
GIRL: Savor the flavors, OK?

475
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,428
KATSUO: It really is good.

476
00:19:33,428 --> 00:19:34,863
-He's eating it.

477
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:36,565
I'm so glad.

478
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:38,900
-Um, Ryoma?

479
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:46,408
Um, um-- Um, how does it taste?

480
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:49,077
-You still have a ways to go.

481
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,047
[screaming]

482
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,986
-His backhand isn't there yet.

483
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:00,522
Hey, what happened to my lunch?

484
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:01,423
-Oh boy.

485
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:03,558
-That Ryoma.

486
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:05,460
-Ah huh.

487
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:07,562
He's sure got
tennis on the brain.

488
00:20:07,562 --> 00:20:09,931
KACHIRO: Sure does.

489
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:10,398
-Oh!

490
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:12,807
Stupid Ryoma!

491
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:26,419
[theme music]

492
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,208
SAKUNO: Hi, everyone.

493
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:59,643
I'm Sakuno Ryuzaki.

494
00:20:59,643 --> 00:21:03,414
Ryoma and Momo are going
at it at a burger shop.

495
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:07,585
I wonder what that's all about?

496
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:11,809
On top of that, he's going to
play a match against students

497
00:21:11,842 --> 00:21:13,778
from another school.

498
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:15,179
Oh dear.

499
00:21:15,212 --> 00:21:17,848
Next on "The Prince of Tennis."

500
00:21:17,882 --> 00:21:20,184
Ryoma Versus Momoshiro.

501
00:21:20,217 --> 00:21:22,853
Will Ryoma be all right?
