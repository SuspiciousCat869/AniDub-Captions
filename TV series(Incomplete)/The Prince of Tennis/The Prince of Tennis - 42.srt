1
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:11,004
-Seigaku, Seigaku,
Seigaku, Seigaku, Seigaku!

2
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:16,304
Investigate,
Investigate, Investigate.

3
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:18,738
I've got to investigate.

4
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:20,704
Whoa, I-- I can't see!

5
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:21,671
I can't see!

6
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:27,771
Whoa.

7
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:30,404
Everything's gone black!

8
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:31,904
What happened?

9
00:00:31,938 --> 00:00:34,571
[shouting]

10
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:35,538
-Hey.

11
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:36,838
Your bandana's
covering your eyes.

12
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:37,538
-Huh?

13
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,404
Oh yeah, you're right.

14
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,171
Thanks so much.

15
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:48,271
Oh, you must be from Seigaku!

16
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:50,071
-Very observant.

17
00:00:50,104 --> 00:00:51,271
-All right!

18
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:55,404
Um, I mean, you must be
here to cheer him on too,

19
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:56,738
isn't that right?

20
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:57,771
-Him?

21
00:00:57,804 --> 00:01:01,171
-Yeah, that seventh
grader, Echizenia.

22
00:01:01,204 --> 00:01:03,638
He's an awesome
seventh grader like me.

23
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:08,504
I'd give anything to see
him play with my own eyes.

24
00:01:08,538 --> 00:01:11,504
[theme music]

25
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:26,526
SAKUNO: I really didn't
our number two doubles team

26
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:29,359
of Fuji Kawamura would lose.

27
00:02:29,393 --> 00:02:30,693
TOMOKA: But it's OK, Sakuno.

28
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:31,759
Don't fret.

29
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,226
Up next are Oishi and Kikumaru.

30
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:36,393
Seigaku's golden pair.

31
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:37,526
-I suppose you're right.

32
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,426
-It'll be a cinch.

33
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,726
An easy win.

34
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,459
-I wonder.

35
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,659
-Huh?

36
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:43,993
-Yamabuki Junior High's
number one doubles lineup

37
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:47,326
is the same as last year,
with Minami and Higashikata.

38
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:49,293
I hope Oishi does
not strain himself.

39
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:55,259
-No way!

40
00:02:55,293 --> 00:02:58,026
You say that the seventh grader
is only 151 centimeters tall?

41
00:02:58,059 --> 00:02:59,593
That makes him my height!

42
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:02,293
I thought he'd be
built more like Akutsu.

43
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:03,426
-Huh?

44
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:04,526
-Oh.

45
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,959
Never mind, I'm just babbling.

46
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,559
Anyway, you're a real
lifesaver, thanks so much.

47
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:15,226
-I didn't expect to hear that
a seventh grader, the Seigaku

48
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,526
regular, was such a shrimp.

49
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:19,693
-Don't tell me you're
on the tennis team.

50
00:03:19,726 --> 00:03:21,126
-Um, well yeah.

51
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,593
But you see, I'm not a player.

52
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:23,559
I'm just the manager.

53
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:25,959
-Yeah?

54
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:28,159
-You see, I'm too
short to play, really.

55
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:32,059
-Ryoma!

56
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:33,926
-Hm?

57
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,426
-Are you goofing off again?

58
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,293
TAICHI (VOICEOVER): Ryoma?

59
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:38,959
-Well, come on.

60
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:40,259
Let's hurry.

61
00:03:40,293 --> 00:03:42,659
Oishi's match is about to
start, and he needs our support.

62
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:44,393
-Yeah, I know, I'm coming.

63
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,026
I never knew tennis was
all about how tall you are.

64
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,559
-Mr. Inoue, don't you think
we should get going too?

65
00:04:07,593 --> 00:04:09,959
Ah!

66
00:04:09,993 --> 00:04:11,059
He's here.

67
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:12,326
Disgusting.

68
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:13,493
-Hm.

69
00:04:13,526 --> 00:04:17,226
-I wonder what Mr.
Nanjiro's doing around here.

70
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:17,959
-I don't see him.

71
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:18,793
I don't see him.

72
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,559
I don't see that awful sight.

73
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,259
I'll go on ahead.

74
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:21,759
-Huh?

75
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:26,526
-Hey there, Oishi.

76
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,226
It's been awhile.

77
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:34,793
ANNOUNCER: One set match.

78
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,493
Minami of Yamabuki to serve.

79
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:52,126
-Now, Oishi.

80
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,093
Don't strain yourself
until after I'm done.

81
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:54,593
-Eiji.

82
00:04:58,093 --> 00:04:58,859
All right.

83
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:00,159
Now we can play as usual.

84
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:00,759
-Let's go.

85
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:04,593
BANDA: Coach Ryuzaki.

86
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:05,593
-Huh?

87
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:07,593
What is it, Mr. Banda?

88
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:09,126
-We'll be taking
two of the doubles

89
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,993
matches again this year.

90
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:15,059
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER): That
old geezer, arrogant as ever.

91
00:05:15,093 --> 00:05:17,593
But is it worth having
that problem child just

92
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:20,626
to strengthen
their singles game?

93
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:23,126
-Banji, isn't the game
of tennis supposed

94
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,993
to be about having fun?

95
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:29,126
-Oh, absolutely
correct, Coach Ryuzaki.

96
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:30,659
That's always been
my philosophy.

97
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:38,059
Oh, dear.

98
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:41,759
Things appear
unfortunate for Oishi.

99
00:05:41,793 --> 00:05:44,493
Better remind him of
what happened last year.

100
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:56,493
ANNOUNCER: 15-Love.

101
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:58,893
[excited chatter]

102
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,326
-That was amazing.

103
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,459
-Yeah, what impeccable timing.

104
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:04,626
-They've certainly worked
to improve their game

105
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:05,526
since last year.

106
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,093
ANNOUNCER: 30-Love.

107
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:25,159
-Oh no.

108
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:27,293
It's early and they're
taking a beating.

109
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:29,759
-But doesn't it seem like
they're targeting Oishi?

110
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:37,259
-Yo.

111
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:39,693
Thanks for the drink.

112
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:42,526
-You came here to watch
Ryoma's game, yes?

113
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:43,593
-Nah, get real.

114
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:45,459
Why would I wanna do
something like that?

115
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:48,359
I got bored ringing the
bell, so I took a walk.

116
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:50,526
-Seems a bit convenient
that you came all the way

117
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,593
out here just for a walk.

118
00:06:55,293 --> 00:06:56,459
-Let's see.

119
00:06:56,493 --> 00:06:58,226
Wonder if there are any
pretty girls around here.

120
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:02,759
INOUE (VOICEOVER): Hm.

121
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:04,093
Something's up with him.

122
00:07:09,393 --> 00:07:10,626
HORIO: I knew it!

123
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:12,793
They are focusing their
attack exclusively on Oishi.

124
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:18,826
-Game to Yamabuki.

125
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:20,659
One game to Love.

126
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:22,226
-Their attack
pattern is familiar.

127
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:39,059
It's the same tactic
they used in defeating

128
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:41,526
Oishi and his
teammate last year.

129
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,526
EIJI (VOICEOVER): Shoot.

130
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:46,859
What a nasty attack.

131
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:51,926
All right!

132
00:07:57,126 --> 00:07:58,559
-No, don't move, Eiji!

133
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:05,026
OISHI (VOICEOVER):
Last year, I moved up,

134
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:06,526
thinking it would
help me partner

135
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,993
who was being singled out.

136
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,559
If we act impatiently now,
we'll lose the match for sure.

137
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:17,826
Their target isn't me.

138
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:21,093
They wanna draw out my partner
and break our formation.

139
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:27,393
The thing to do
now is-- The thing

140
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:30,859
to do now is counter their
attacks by staying composed.

141
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:37,793
BOYS: Moon volley!

142
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:46,926
ANNOUNCER: 15-Love.

143
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,026
-You didn't think you could
beat me with the same tactic

144
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,659
as last year, did you?

145
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:51,859
-Hm.

146
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:55,226
-He tore down last year's
walls all by himself.

147
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,459
-Oh, he's a level
headed one, and he's

148
00:08:57,493 --> 00:09:01,426
maturing into a fine player.

149
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,793
-Nice one, Oishi.

150
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,493
-That's the magic
of Oishi for you.

151
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:07,993
-You just gotta love
that stoic vibe of his.

152
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:09,159
Of course!

153
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:10,126
-I see.

154
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,459
So this is the
Seigaku golden pair.

155
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:15,614
Looks like we can
have a little fun.

156
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:20,279
-Momoshiro.

157
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:21,813
Time for you to get warmed up.

158
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:23,646
-Got you.

159
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,479
Yeah.

160
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:27,146
I've got the adrenaline pumping.

161
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:29,679
-Hey you, don't
get carried away.

162
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:30,946
-What are you trying to say?

163
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:31,746
-Seriously.

164
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,513
Do your warm up properly.

165
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:35,779
-You don't have to
tell me anything.

166
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:38,279
[hiss]

167
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:38,779
-Huh?

168
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,379
-Da da dada!

169
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:49,346
Here's Ryoma's data!

170
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:02,946
-Don't you dare embarrass
yourself like this ever again.

171
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:05,379
-I'm very sorry.

172
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:05,913
JIN: Taichi.

173
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:08,679
-Y-- Yes sir?

174
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:09,713
-Mark my words.

175
00:10:09,746 --> 00:10:11,813
I'm gonna nuke that little runt.

176
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:28,246
ANNOUNCER: Game to
Seigaku, one game all.

177
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,246
-Good work.

178
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,913
Let's keep it up, Eiji.

179
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:31,846
-Right Oishi.

180
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:38,779
-What's the matter, Banji?

181
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:41,546
You're not looking very well.

182
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:46,146
[groaning]

183
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,446
-Hey, Banji, are you OK?

184
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,246
Banji!

185
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:49,713
Banji!

186
00:10:58,913 --> 00:10:59,379
Banji!

187
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:07,846
I swear, you're the same as
ever, you heartless geezer.

188
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,513
Unreal.

189
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:13,179
-He may have torn down last
year's walls by himself,

190
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:15,179
but every day, those
walls are getting

191
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:16,679
higher and higher, Ryuzaki.

192
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:29,946
BOY (VOICEOVER): I guess it's
time to go for the poach.

193
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:31,146
OK, Minami.

194
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:32,879
Our target is over there.

195
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:38,479
-He's sharp.

196
00:11:38,513 --> 00:11:39,179
-A poach?

197
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,346
-Very nice.

198
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,846
-It seems as though
they controlled

199
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,613
the course of the
serve beforehand

200
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:52,079
and dictated its return
course for a poach.

201
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:54,179
-They're doing a
great job using sides.

202
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,979
-Furthermore, to return such
an accurate and powerful serve,

203
00:11:58,013 --> 00:12:00,713
one cannot avoid playing
right into their hands.

204
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:08,979
ANNOUNCER: Game to
Yamabuki, two games to one.

205
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:09,846
Change courts.

206
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:13,579
[excited chatter]

207
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:15,179
-They pulled back
the winning tide

208
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:17,513
with their basic, surefire play.

209
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:19,679
They're plain, but
those solid basics

210
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:21,813
are definitely hard to beat.

211
00:12:21,846 --> 00:12:23,279
That's why our
number one doubles

212
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:27,613
team is also known
as plain and simple.

213
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,079
BOY: Come on, plain and simple!

214
00:12:29,113 --> 00:12:32,179
-Hey, don't you
ever call us that!

215
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:33,613
BANDA (VOICEOVER):
Plain and simple

216
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:36,913
are a tough team to beat with
their flawlessly perfected

217
00:12:36,946 --> 00:12:37,413
basics.

218
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:57,879
OISHI (VOICEOVER): They're
doing great using signs.

219
00:12:57,913 --> 00:13:01,279
They have certainly polished
their skills from last year.

220
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,646
Plain and simple indeed.

221
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,279
I can't find an
opening in their play.

222
00:13:05,313 --> 00:13:06,013
At this rate--

223
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:09,646
-Oishi.

224
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,813
Daigoro the bear
snoozed off where?

225
00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:15,413
-Daigoro the bear?

226
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:17,379
-Who'd he say snoozed off?

227
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:18,213
-What bear?

228
00:13:18,246 --> 00:13:19,846
-Hey, Higashikata, concentrate.

229
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,613
Don't get all confused.

230
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:24,779
-Daigoro the bear snoozed off.

231
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:26,946
That's it.

232
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:29,779
That stuffed animal
at Eiji's house.

233
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:31,679
It's always slumped over.

234
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:32,679
-OK.

235
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:36,013
To the left.

236
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:38,079
BANDA: That's a good
strategy, sending

237
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:40,879
the ball on a cross court
shot, forcing the opponent

238
00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:44,246
to run to volley, then cutting
off the return with a poach

239
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,679
by Kikumaru.

240
00:13:45,713 --> 00:13:48,546
However, there's a
flaw with that plan.

241
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,346
Even from a stance
like that, Minami

242
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:53,079
can easily return it
with a straight shot.

243
00:13:59,513 --> 00:13:59,979
-There!

244
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,313
-Yay!

245
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:09,779
-What an acrobatic shot.

246
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:11,779
-Yeah, go, Kikumaru!

247
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:13,679
ANNOUNCER: Love-15.

248
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:16,513
-Wh-- What kind of
trick play was that?

249
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:27,013
-It's OK to start attacking
them now, right Oishi?

250
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:28,679
-Yeah, you've waited
long enough, Eiji.

251
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:29,879
Time for action.

252
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:30,979
-Commencing attack.

253
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:34,213
-All right!

254
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:35,213
-Oh yeah!

255
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:37,679
HORIO: Kikumaru's on a rebound.

256
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:41,146
-There you go.

257
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:41,646
There.

258
00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:49,613
-Huh?

259
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:50,579
-Victory.

260
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:51,746
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER):
Sorry, Banji,

261
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:55,179
but it seems our students
have one upped yours.

262
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:57,313
With Kikumaru's
acrobatic play, you

263
00:14:57,346 --> 00:14:59,946
can see the golden pair's
explosive abilities

264
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:00,879
for yourself.

265
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,846
ANNOUNCER: Game and match
Seigaku, seven games to five.

266
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:08,413
-Hm.

267
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:09,313
-They did it!

268
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:11,279
A comeback victory.

269
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:13,246
-Seigaku's golden pair
is totally awesome!

270
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:20,179
-Minami, Higashikata,
your game was flawless.

271
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:22,146
However, there was a
flaw in your hearts.

272
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:24,013
Knowing that you
beat Oishi last year,

273
00:15:24,046 --> 00:15:27,379
you failed to take into
account his bond with Kikumaru.

274
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:30,446
This outcome is
the result of that.

275
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:34,879
Coach Ryuzaki, it seems I
underestimated you as well.

276
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,179
-Maybe next time.

277
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:36,879
-Yeah.

278
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:37,746
[rattling]

279
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:40,379
-Huh?

280
00:15:40,413 --> 00:15:41,679
-Hey.

281
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:45,046
My thanks to you for such
a miserable, pathetic loss.

282
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:46,579
-Akutsu.

283
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,946
Now I can really torture
that seventh grader.

284
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:55,413
[wicked laughter]

285
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:59,579
[screaming]

286
00:15:59,613 --> 00:16:00,879
-What's wrong?

287
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:02,346
All I did was ask if they
wanted to have tea with me.

288
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,813
They didn't have to go
off running and screaming

289
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:05,946
like that.

290
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:08,713
-Looking as disheveled
and unshaven as you do,

291
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:10,646
you can't blame them
for running away.

292
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,379
-Yo, Banji.

293
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:29,813
It's been a long time.

294
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:31,679
-It certainly has been.

295
00:16:31,713 --> 00:16:34,746
I see your skill in flirting
has not improved very much.

296
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:36,246
Pity, Nanjiro Echizen.

297
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,413
-I'll say this.

298
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:39,779
You sure are as talkative
as ever, you old geezer.

299
00:16:39,813 --> 00:16:42,613
-Are you here to
root for your son?

300
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:43,646
-Heh.

301
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,546
No, I haven't got
that much free time.

302
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:48,813
-Then it must be destiny,
competing against your son

303
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:51,013
at this late date in my career.

304
00:16:51,046 --> 00:16:55,379
Or maybe I've just
lived too long.

305
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,246
-What are you saying?

306
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,713
-I can still remember the
game like it was yesterday.

307
00:17:00,746 --> 00:17:02,379
It's a fond memory of mine.

308
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:03,779
One I'll never forget.

309
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:07,413
Now, years later, I look
forward to seeing your son play.

310
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:09,846
I'm sure I'll never
forget it either.

311
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:10,313
Goodbye.

312
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:22,613
MAN: Right.

313
00:17:22,646 --> 00:17:25,879
Yamabuki Junior High's
advisor, Mikiya Banda.

314
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:27,813
Can you email me the file?

315
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,479
Yeah, as an attachment.

316
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:31,579
The data we analyzed
last month should still

317
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:32,846
be on the editor's PC.

318
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:35,979
Oh, and can you also look
up the win-lose statistics

319
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,413
for the schools
that Banda advised?

320
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:40,579
ANNOUNCER: We will begin
the Yamabuki versus Seigaku

321
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:43,479
number three singles match
in just a few moments.

322
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:44,646
-Yes.

323
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,446
The singles match that'll
decide the finals.

324
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,513
Oh, hey.

325
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:49,813
Now where did you run
off to, Mr. Inoue?

326
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:51,646
-I was gathering
important information

327
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,046
while you were fooling around.

328
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,779
-How rude of you!

329
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:56,179
I wasn't fooling around at all.

330
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:04,046
-I guess I'm not so
lucky these days.

331
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,846
I drew lots and got the
number three singles spot,

332
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:09,713
but my opponent is not Echizen.

333
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:12,113
Aw, how disappointing.

334
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:13,613
[clearing throat]

335
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:14,446
-Huh?

336
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:17,079
Excuse me for not being Echizen.

337
00:18:17,113 --> 00:18:18,746
-Oh no, that's not what I meant.

338
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:20,313
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:22,146
I know, you're Momoshiro, right?

340
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:23,979
I heard you do a dunk smash.

341
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:25,513
That's pretty impressive.

342
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:27,213
-Spare me your
psychological tricks.

343
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:28,613
ANNOUNCER: Please
toss the racket

344
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:30,146
to decide who serves first.

345
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,646
-You call it.

346
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,346
-I'll take the serve.

347
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:39,513
-You shouldn't say that
until after you've called it.

348
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:40,279
-I'll get it.

349
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:42,113
I haven't missed a call yet.

350
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:43,079
-Hmph.

351
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:45,213
-Well, I guess I'll
be calling down.

352
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:46,713
-Well, you're pretty confident.

353
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,013
Yes!

354
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:54,846
It's up.

355
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:56,946
I got the serve!

356
00:18:56,979 --> 00:18:57,446
Huh?

357
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:57,946
Hey!

358
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:02,846
-See?

359
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:05,079
I told you.

360
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:06,713
-Momo is so unlucky.

361
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:10,346
He would've had that serve if
it didn't get caught on the net.

362
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:13,079
-I can see know why they
call him by the nickname

363
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:14,279
Lucky Sengoku.

364
00:19:14,313 --> 00:19:15,346
-Huh?

365
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:16,679
Lucky Sengoku?

366
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:17,613
-Know what?

367
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:20,046
I'll let you serve
first after all.

368
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,913
-What?

369
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:24,046
-Today's lucky
direction is northeast,

370
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,779
so I'll be on that side of the
court to receive your serve.

371
00:19:30,613 --> 00:19:31,579
-Mm-hm.

372
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:33,546
Lucky Sengoku.

373
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,346
[phone ringing]

374
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:35,946
-Huh?

375
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:37,346
Hey.

376
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:39,146
Uh, it's me.

377
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,046
Ah huh.

378
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,279
-Man, it's hot.

379
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,779
I could really use a
nice, cold root beer.

380
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:46,579
-Oh, Mr. Inoue.

381
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:48,213
The match is just
about to start.

382
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:49,946
Don't you want-- Huh?

383
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:51,046
-Shiba.

384
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,213
It looks like we've got
ourselves a situation.

385
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:56,746
Long ago, Mikiya Banda
was a tennis team advisor

386
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,646
for a school that defeated
Seigaku in a team competition.

387
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,446
Back in those days, Seigaku
was the strongest middle school

388
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,246
team.

389
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,646
-Huh?

390
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,513
INOUE: Seigaku's ace player at
that time was Nanjiro Echizen.

391
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:25,168
[theme music]

392
00:20:57,968 --> 00:20:59,001
SENGOKU: I'm Sengoku.

393
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:01,635
Kyosumi Sengoku, that is.

394
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:03,301
Finally, my turn is up.

395
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:04,301
Let's see.

396
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:06,235
Who's my victim this time?

397
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:08,868
Hey, it's Mr.
Spikey-Haired himself.

398
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,468
People call me Mr.
Brunette, but don't

399
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:13,235
get us all mixed up together.

400
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:15,468
I'm not that passionate
about my hair.

401
00:21:15,501 --> 00:21:17,768
I get my wins with
my incredible luck.

402
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:21,935
Next on "The Prince of
Tennis," Lucky Sengoku.

403
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:24,768
You got quite a personality
yourself, Momoshiro.
