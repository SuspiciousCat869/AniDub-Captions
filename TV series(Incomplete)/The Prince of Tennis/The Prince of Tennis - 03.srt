that good, I'll play you.

That's right, you don't

wrong with you now?

play me anymore?

get to do is retrieve balls.

matter how I feel.

can't play until summer.

-It's really not that bad.

183
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,617
-No letting up!

184
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,217
50 more sit ups!

185
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,948
-No way.

186
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:15,048
-I can't believe it.

187
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:18,981
-I think it's over here.

188
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:22,314
Ryoma Echizen.

189
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:28,609
It's too bad.

190
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:31,276
Until the summer camp,
all the kid can work on

191
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,209
is conditioning himself.

192
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:35,209
He can't even enter
the challenge.

193
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:38,009
-37.

194
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:41,309
-Aww, I've got to stop.

195
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:43,242
-50.

196
00:09:43,276 --> 00:09:44,109
-Hey, Echizen.

197
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:45,309
Turn around, it's them.

198
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:45,809
-Who?

199
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:58,542
[Arai scoffs]

200
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:03,376
-Who the heck does this kid
think he is with three rackets?

201
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:05,042
Echizen, I wouldn't
get too cocky

202
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:07,442
if I were you just because
you can play a little.

203
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:10,276
The regulars rock, and
they're coming back today.

204
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,042
Don't worry, I'll
put you in your place

205
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:13,276
before they get that.

206
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:15,209
-Look.

207
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:17,476
-Hey, they're here.

208
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,976
-What?

209
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,375
-Wow.

210
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:07,754
-Well, here come the
regulars of Seigaku.

211
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,112
-[all at once] Hello, sir!

212
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,125
-Everyone relax.

213
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:14,058
Just find a court
and start to hit.

214
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,358
We'll give you a chance to
show us your best stuff.

215
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:17,491
-This is great.

216
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:18,758
We have a chance to play.

217
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,625
-You know that's
Captain Tezuka, right?

218
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:22,791
He went totally
undefeated last year.

219
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:24,658
-Yeah, he's really great.

220
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:26,458
-He's amazing.

221
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:27,858
-Hey, Oishi.

222
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:29,058
-Hmm?

223
00:11:29,091 --> 00:11:30,391
-Hey, let's you and me go
out and hit some balls.

224
00:11:30,425 --> 00:11:31,525
-Yeah, that's a good idea.

225
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:35,658
Let's warm up before
Tezuka gets here.

226
00:11:35,691 --> 00:11:37,058
-I don't think that was Tezuka.

227
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:51,991
[Horio hums nervously]

228
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:52,491
-Come on.

229
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:00,091
-Come on, Fuji.

230
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,358
Keep your feet moving.

231
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:05,858
-Amazing.

232
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,891
-Wow.

233
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:10,958
No matter where he
hits it, those guys

234
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:12,991
can return it right
into the basket.

235
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:18,358
-I've never seen
anyone who can do that.

236
00:12:18,391 --> 00:12:21,491
-That's why they're
on Seigaku's top team.

237
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:23,458
They're awesome.

238
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:25,458
-Our team's pretty
darn good, all right.

239
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:26,891
Do you get it yet?

240
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:27,791
Hey, you.

241
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:28,891
Echizen.

242
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:30,891
You may be able to hit
a decent kick serve,

243
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:35,558
but that doesn't guarantee
you'll make the team.

244
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:36,991
-Darn, I shanked it.

245
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:53,317
[all gasp]

246
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:01,058
-Huh?

247
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,558
-Now that wasn't so hard.

248
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:09,425
-What, you think you
can show off here?

249
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,825
I'll show you.

250
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:13,025
You're going to learn who's on
top of the ladder around here.

251
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,425
TEZUKA: What's going on, guys?

252
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,325
-Huh?

253
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:19,825
-[all at once] Captain!

254
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:22,558
Sir!

255
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:24,725
-You can act like this.

256
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:26,991
I want both you
to take ten laps.

257
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:29,158
-But you understand.

258
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:29,958
I was just--

259
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:31,158
-20 laps.

260
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:32,725
-OK.

261
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:35,091
-And as far as the
rest of you go,

262
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,591
eighth and ninth graders rally.

263
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,558
Seventh grade, pick up balls.

264
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:40,158
-[all at once] Yes, sir.

265
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:43,525
-Aww, he is so cool.

266
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:45,691
-OK, let's go.

267
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,125
-That kid.

268
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:49,791
I'm going to make him
pay, him and his hat.

269
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:51,091
-Man, did you look dumb.

270

ARAI: Hey guys.

272

Come here a minute.

[rapid footsteps]

274
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:08,258
-Keep it going.

275
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:08,991
Low to high.

00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:13,291
-66, 67, 68.

-Hey, Ryoma.

00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:16,458
Did you finish 20 laps?

-You don't even look tired.

280

-Seventh graders have
to practice top spin.

281
00:14:20,758 --> 00:14:21,858
Get started.

282
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:23,425
-Yeah.

283
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,925
-Hey, what's wrong with you?

284
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,625
Did you forget your racket?

285
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:27,925
-No.

practice without a racket.

-Think you're better
than everyone else, huh?

288
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:34,825
-Well, he is the
hot shot rookie.

Here we go again.

-If you think you're
that good, I'll play you.

294

Huh, darn it, I forgot.

295
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:48,091
That's right, you don't
have a racket to play with.

-Ha ha.

297
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,591
Here, I've got one.

-Hey, kid.

299
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:55,425
Looks like your day.

-The one from the locker room.

302

-You can't.

303
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:01,458
The strings are old and
the frame is broken.

304
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:03,825
-You cannot play with that.

305
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:05,958
-So, hot shot, what's
wrong with you now?

306
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:06,891
What's the deal?

307
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:08,491
Don't you want to
play me anymore?

308
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:10,025
-Arai is such a jerk.

309
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:13,491
He knows no one can play with
a beat-up old racket like that.

310
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:19,691
-Hey, look.

311
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:20,191
-Huh?

00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:26,191
-Arai is picking on the
new seventh graders again.

-What do you think we should do?

Tezuka is going to be furious.

is perfect for a showboat

Now learn your lesson
and shape up, little man.

319
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,125
Then if you're lucky,
maybe your rackets

320
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:44,591
will mysteriously reappear.

I guess you have to take it.

00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,225
-What was that?

00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:03,125
You accusing me of
something, you little twerp?

327
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:03,591
-Whatever.

328
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,625
Big shot, let's just play.

-Hey, so I think I'll
stick around for this.

-I thought you'd say that.

331

-You've got guts, kid.

332
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:22,358
Too but I'm still going
to have to take you apart.

333
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:23,791
-Echizen's an idiot.

334
00:16:23,825 --> 00:16:25,391
I don't care how
good he thinks he is.

335
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:27,525
He can't win with that racket.

336
00:16:27,558 --> 00:16:28,691
-Is that kid crazy?

337
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:29,891
He can't win.

338
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:30,958
-So then I told her that--

00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:31,991
[Sakuno and Tomoka gasp]

340
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,725
-It's him!

341

-What do you think is going on?

342
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:43,474
-My serve.

343
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:52,174
-I knew it.

344
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:54,774
He can't play with
that broken up racket.

345
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,241
-What's the matter, runt?

346
00:16:56,274 --> 00:16:58,541
You still think you
can keep up with me?

347
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:01,374
Let's see what you
can do with this.

348
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:01,941
Come on!

349
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,707
Heh.

350
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:07,707
-It's no good.

351
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:09,707
He has absolutely no
control with that.

352
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:11,741
He needs to have his own racket.

353
00:17:11,774 --> 00:17:14,541
-We shouldn't let this blood
bath go on for too long.

354

-Hmm.

356
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:21,007
With that old piece of junk,
the kid just can't get any spin.

357
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,341
-This little punk is
going to down big time.

358
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:25,441
He'd better quit
and go home now.

359
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:27,541
I won't let him make a
laughing stock out of me.

-Hmm.

362
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:34,641
Now I've got it.

363
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:36,574
-Is he a complete moron?

364
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:38,774
-Let's see your stuff, stud.

365
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,907
Try to return this!

366
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:52,541
-He crushed it!

367
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:53,974
-Ryoma's my hero!

368
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:55,107
-Wow.

369
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,274
He turned his body to
get extra spin on it.

370
00:17:57,307 --> 00:17:58,707
-Not so bad.

371
00:17:58,741 --> 00:17:59,907
-Can you believe it?

372
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:02,374
He actually returned the
ball with that old thing.

373
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:04,107
-Could be it wasn't
all that bad.

374
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:04,974
-Don't kid yourself.

375
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:06,541
I think he might be that good.

376
00:18:06,574 --> 00:18:07,607
-Maybe.

377
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:11,007
-I thought that ball
was a clean winner.

378
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,241
-That ball was a little slow.

379
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:17,541
-Don't fool yourself, punk,
just because you got lucky.

380
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:23,541
Hit this!

381
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:25,941
How did he return my
serve with that racket?

382
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,641
-Well, I guess if
you're that good,

383
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:34,607
the racket really
doesn't matter.

384
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:35,741
-He'll win.

385
00:18:35,774 --> 00:18:36,874
Watch out.

386
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,174
-Yeah.

387
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,141
-I can't believe that little
creep is going to beat me.

388
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:44,807
-Don't trip on the ball.

389
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:45,307
-No!

390
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,074
-I can't believe my eyes.

391
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:58,507
Echizen is totally that good.

392
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,807
He probably could even
play with a frying pan.

393
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:04,007
[Mr. Inoue gasps]

394
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,107
-That seventh grader's amazing.

395
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:09,741
-[crowd] All right, Ryoma!

396
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:13,174
-Hey, that was a bad move,
making the eighth grade

397
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:15,607
team look dumb.

398
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:17,041
-Come on, Kaidoh.

399
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,974
-I'm out of here.

400
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:22,074
-So I guess it's time
to turn up the heat.

401
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:22,574
-Wha?

402
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:28,807
-Look.

403
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:30,074
Echizen has a broken string.

404
00:19:30,107 --> 00:19:31,207
-Where?

405
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:32,274
Oh.

406
00:19:32,307 --> 00:19:32,774
No worries.

407
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,574
We're not finished
playing yet, Arai.

408
00:19:38,607 --> 00:19:39,874
You ready?

409
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:41,774
-Eh, no.

410
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:42,941
-Let it go already.

411
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,641
He looks really tired.

412
00:19:44,674 --> 00:19:48,207
-Well, this match doesn't
even count, right?

413
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:49,439
-No way.

414
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:54,871
-So captain, what do you think?

415
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:57,337
-I can't let anybody
break the rules.

416
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:58,837
Have everyone run laps.

417
00:19:58,871 --> 00:20:00,171
-Wha?

418
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:01,471
Even the regulars?

419
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:01,971
-Everyone.

420
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:05,804
-Heh.

421
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,537
Well, well, well.

422
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:09,571
-What's this?

423
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:11,537
Ahh.

424
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:14,337
So he picked Echizen, huh?

425
00:20:24,205 --> 00:20:53,316
[rock music playing]

426
00:20:55,236 --> 00:20:55,736
-Hey.

427
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,570
I'm Kaidoh.

428
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,036
I'm on the eighth grade team.

429
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,503
There's a first
year showboat named

430
00:20:59,536 --> 00:21:03,003
Echizen in my bracket, bracket
D. Hey, you seventh graders,

431
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:04,170
the ones videotaping.

432
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:05,436
Quit wandering around.

433
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,336
Don't try anything crazy.

434
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,270
Just because there's
one seventh grade

435
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:12,570
snake in the grass doesn't
mean you guys stand a chance.

436
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:16,103
Next on Prince of Tennis,
"The One Named Viper."

437
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:17,903
Who's the viper?

438
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:21,194
Guess.
