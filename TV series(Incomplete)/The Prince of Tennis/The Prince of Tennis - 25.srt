1
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:10,128
-Coach Ryuzaki,
I want you to let

2
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:11,828
me play a match against Echizen.

3
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:14,462
-But the metropolitans
are coming up.

4
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:15,528
-Yes.

5
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:18,462
-Are you sure you want
to play right now?

6
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:19,462
-Yes.

7
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:20,995
It'll be fine.

8
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:24,962
I know myself well enough.

9
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:26,662
-What's this really about?

10
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:29,862
-Coach, it's just a match.

11
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:33,228
-I need a better reason
than that to allow it.

12
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:34,828
So what is it?

13
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:38,128
-I have a reason.

14
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:39,828
-So do you want to tell me?

15
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:52,262
[theme music]

16
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:07,249
-Wow, looking good.

17
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:11,449
Ooh, you know, I don't
think I'll get a game.

18
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:12,883
-Would you get serious?

19
00:02:20,116 --> 00:02:21,016
Huh?

20
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:24,783
[mumbling]

21
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,449
Man, this is stupid.

22
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:35,283
-You should beat me as
fast as you can, sun.

23
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:36,849
After all, I'm getting old.

24
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,716
-Watch this. [inaudible].

25
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:47,116
-You'll never dunk.

26
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:48,849
-Doesn't Momo mean
that he's never

27
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:50,649
going to get away with it?

28
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:53,616
-Yeah, but everyone's
really pumped up right now.

29
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:55,283
-The district finals
are coming up soon.

30
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:59,316
But guys, they sure don't
sound like real good teammates

31
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:00,383
right now.

32
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,049
-No, they don't.

33
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:06,116
-Your snake shot is a joke.

34
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:08,383
Give me something to hit.

35
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,149
-I'm just getting started.

36
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:11,616
-Ah, bring it on, pal.

37
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,816
One, two, one, two.

38
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:21,649
-Try to put equal
weight on both knees.

39
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:25,149
Your split step puts too
much pressure on one leg.

40
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:27,983
If you don't work up
each of the knees even,

41
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:29,449
you'll risk a torn muscle.

42
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:30,816
---surely be enough.

43
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,049
-Hey, Kikumaru.

44
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,583
-One, two-- huh?

45
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:35,683
What do you want?

46
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,783
-Keep it down.

47
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,049
You're too loud.

48
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:38,549
-OK.

49
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:50,616
-Everybody's looking great.

50
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:52,483
The metros should go well.

51
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:54,549
-We can't let our guard down.

52
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:58,349
No real tournament's a
slam dunk, not for anybody.

53
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:01,116
If we act like it
is, we're sunk.

54
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:03,949
-Y-- you're right.

55
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:05,883
-We've finished
practice for today.

56
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:06,949
No injuries tonight.

57
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,216
Be careful, team.

58
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:08,749
That's it.

59
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:09,249
We're done.

60
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:20,516
Echizen.

61
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:21,016
-Yeah?

62
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:23,016
What's up?

63
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:23,716
-Follow me.

64
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:32,316
-I need a better reason
than that to allow it.

65
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:33,616
So what is it?

66
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,216
-I have a reason.

67
00:04:36,249 --> 00:04:38,283
-So do you want to tell me?

68
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:40,816
-I've recently discovered
that Ryoma's tennis game

69
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:44,849
is identical to Nanjiro
Echizen's, power, speed,

70
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:46,683
and reflexes.

71
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:48,749
He's good at those.

72
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:51,916
Just like his dad, he can
play with either hand.

73
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:54,216
He's just so good at
doing the opposite of what

74
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:56,849
his opponent anticipates.

75
00:04:56,883 --> 00:04:59,716
By playing overseas,
Nanjiro Echizen

76
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:02,583
was able to see his
talents blossom.

77
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:05,649
But I don't think Ryoma
has that spark now.

78
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:09,683
At this rate, he'll end up just
being a copy of his father.

79
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:14,183
-I know for certain he
wants to beat Nanjiro.

80
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:16,316
You think that's not enough?

81
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,383
-Yes.

82
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:21,483
I think he needs to find
his genius, some way

83
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:24,349
to bring his natural
abilities to the surface.

84
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:26,283
-It's just not worth your arm.

85
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:29,049
You're bound to wreck
it in the process.

86
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:29,749
-No.

87
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:31,383
I'll be fine.

88
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,983
Don't worry about me.

89
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:36,049
-But why are you
doing this, Tezuka?

90
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,783
The metros are starting soon.

91
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:42,049
-That's why I need to do
this-- for Echizen's future.

92
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:49,283
-A wall he has to
scale eventually.

93
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:52,149
Hm.

94
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,283
-The courts at Harunodai.

95
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:56,283
Meet me there.

96
00:05:56,316 --> 00:05:58,016
-Under the viaduct, right?

97
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:58,849
I'll meet you there.

98
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:03,249
Huh?

99
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:07,883
What's this?

100
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,916
-I'll play you in three
days at 3 o'clock.

101
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,083
Come alone.

102
00:06:12,116 --> 00:06:13,183
I'll bring the balls.

103
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,083
-You planning a showdown?

104
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:46,949
-You heard then.

105
00:06:46,983 --> 00:06:51,149
-Whatever you're thinking
about, it's crazy.

106
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:52,483
-Don't sweat it.

107
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:53,316
-But you can't.

108
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:58,449
-It's fine.

109
00:07:02,783 --> 00:07:04,316
-Huh?

110
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:08,116
-Did Tezuka tell
you about the match?

111
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:09,483
-Yeah.

112
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,816
-He'll be at his best.

113
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,783
Prepare yourself well.

114
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:16,149
He'll be the toughest
opponent you've ever played.

115
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:21,116
He's number one on the team,
the same level as your dad.

116
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,416
-Huh?

117
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:23,416
-That's all for now.

118
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:42,716
ANNOUNCER (ON TV): It's the
last day of the tournament.

119
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:46,483
The men's singles finals has
turned into a five hour battle.

120
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:50,649
Well, this is another
long rally, isn't it?

121
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:53,383
They took the first
match six-love.

122
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,116
-What are you talking about?

123
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,349
That ain't it, you big galoot.

124
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:02,916
-You should choose.

125
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,416
TV or paper.

126
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:06,816
-You're not watching
either, are you?

127
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,683
You're just sitting
over there daydreaming.

128
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:11,516
Huh?

129
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:13,216
-What's wrong with Ryoma?

130
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:15,449
He's been like that
since he got home.

131
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:17,183
-I know.

132
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:20,283
-He didn't even react
when uncle acted goofy.

133
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:21,283
-What's that?

134
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:22,983
Who said I acted goofy?

135
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:23,816
-We did.

136
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:24,783
-Come one.

137
00:08:41,783 --> 00:08:44,249
TEZUKA (VOICEOVER): I'll play
you in three days at 3 o'clock.

138
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:46,624
Come alone.

139
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:47,690
I'll bring the balls.

140
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:03,490
-Over here.

141
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:04,557
I'm open, Horio.

142
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,057
Hurry.

143
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:05,690
Over here.

144
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:06,990
I've got the shot.

145
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:07,690
-There.

146
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:08,490
-He's going to the hoop.

147
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:09,457
-I got him.

148
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,924
-Come on.

149
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:13,024
-Oh, darn it.

150
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:14,424
Almost.

151
00:09:14,457 --> 00:09:17,224
Huh?

152
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,957
What's wrong with you?

153
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,057
You're really acting
kind of weird.

154
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:21,824
-I'm not.

155
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:22,590
-Huh.

156
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:24,357
I'd say you certainly are.

157
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,657
Of course, that's nothing new.

158
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:38,690
-Tennis is an easy
way to hurt the elbow.

159
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:42,057
I see lots and lots
of tennis elbow here.

160
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,790
Although in your
case, I think there's

161
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:47,690
more damage to the
joint than just that.

162
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:50,624
It appears that your drop shot
is putting a lot of strain

163
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:51,757
on the joint.

164
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,657
-But uncle, how long's
he going to be out for?

165
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,924
We need him.

166
00:09:56,957 --> 00:09:59,824
We can't win the championships
without him on our team.

167
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:02,724
-Shuichiro, you
need to calm down.

168
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:04,957
Now, listen to me.

169
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,624
You're going to be just fine.

170
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:10,790
In fact, the
injury's all better.

171
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:12,324
-You're gonna live.

172
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:13,857
DOCTOR: The bad news
is you shouldn't

173
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,790
play for long
durations for a while.

174
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,057
If you do play, don't
use your drop shot.

175
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:18,557
Understood?

176
00:10:21,957 --> 00:10:23,524
-I'm really glad
you're all right.

177
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:24,357
But listen.

178
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,890
Don't play Echizen.

179
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:28,057
-My arm's fine.

180
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,024
I can play.

181
00:10:29,057 --> 00:10:32,157
But the doctor told you not to.

182
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,690
-I already told you.

183
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:34,357
I'll play.

184
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,646
-It's kind of weird for Tezuka
to be exercising, isn't it?

185
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,246
-The metropolitan's coming up.

186
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,046
He's getting ready.

187
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,446
-We had another
tough practice today.

188
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:14,946
-There aren't many
days left before

189
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:16,779
the metropolitan tournament.

190
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:18,912
Get as much rest as
you can until then.

191
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:19,446
-OK.

192
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:19,946
-Right.

193
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,846
[alarm clock]

194
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,446
-Legendary player
Nanjiro Echizen.

195
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:55,946
Huh.

196
00:12:02,912 --> 00:12:07,212
-Uh, is it just me, or are
there fewer players here today?

197
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:09,279
-I think you just
might be right.

198
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,446
It looks like Ryoma's missing.

199
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,146
-Oh, man.

200
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:14,412
That guy is so lazy.

201
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:17,079
-Hey, guys, where's the captain?

202
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,512
-Yeah, and Oishi's
not here either.

203
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:21,779
Even the little
guy's not around.

204
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:23,279
What's going on?

205
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:25,979
-Echizen's out due to illness.

206
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,079
-But he's never sick.

207
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:29,379
-And the captain?

208
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:31,046
-Also sick.

209
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:32,379
-How about Oishi?

210
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:33,512
-Sick too.

211
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:34,646
-Huh?

212
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,146
-I think I smell a conspiracy.

213
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:39,412
-Tennis conspiracy you think?

214
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:42,979
-Maybe they're sabotaging
someone who's been a real pain.

215
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,512
Hm, that doesn't sound so good.

216
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:46,179
-Calm down.

217
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:46,879
Calm down.

218
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:47,779
Worry about yourselves.

219
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:48,979
You need to start practice.

220
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:49,479
Go.

221
00:12:55,446 --> 00:12:57,812
[gong]

222
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:59,179
-Hey there, Nanjiro.

223
00:12:59,212 --> 00:12:59,946
It's been a while.

224
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,146
-Eh?

225
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:04,546
Oh, Inoue, long time no see.

226
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:06,312
-Yeah.

227
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:08,379
Do you have time
for a few questions?

228
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,279
-Oh, sure.

229
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:11,746
I'll always make time for you.

230
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:15,046
Hey, did you, uh, bring
that girl with you?

231
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:15,812
-Actually, no.

232
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:17,412
I'm alone today.

233
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:21,846
-I, uh, not Nanjiro.

234
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:24,046
-Please, Nanjiro.

235
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,279
-Ah, go ahead.

236
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,079
What's your question?

237
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:29,546
-Well, about what
you were saying,

238
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:33,046
what Ryoma needs to work on
in order to improve his game?

239
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,379
-Oh?

240
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:35,979
-You were right
all along when you

241
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:40,912
said that Ryoma's current game
now is just a copy of yours.

242
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,046
As long as he remains
a copy for you,

243
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,946
he won't be able
to overtake you.

244
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:48,879
He switched his
racket while playing

245
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,512
in the district preliminary.

246
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:56,412
It was doubtless he was
just copying you, Nanjiro.

247
00:13:56,446 --> 00:14:00,046
But after he hurt
his eye, the last

248
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,146
point he showed us was his
overhead smash with a kick.

249
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:17,912
That was not just a
copy of your game.

250
00:14:17,946 --> 00:14:20,012
It was Ryoma
Echizen's own style.

251
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,946
Looks like he overcame the
obstacle of your long shadow,

252
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:29,046
didn't he?

253
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,012
-He didn't.

254
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:31,379
-Huh?

255
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,646
-Even if it stops
copying my tennis,

256
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,779
he won't be able to beat me?

257
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:37,246
-Can he ever?

258
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,479
Do you think there's
something else he has to do?

259
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:42,912
-Yes, I do.

260
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:44,646
But he's just going
to have to figure out

261
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,746
that one for himself.

262
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:52,379
TEZUKA: Are you ready?

263
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:52,946
RYOMA: I am.

264
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:24,821
-Tezuka.

265
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,921
-Well, you had a little
heat on that one.

266
00:15:58,954 --> 00:15:59,388
Huh?

267
00:16:32,321 --> 00:16:34,388
SHUICHIRO (VOICEOVER):
You've gotta stop, Tezuka.

268
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:35,888
Your arm is--

269
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,988
-Echizen, think you can beat me?

270
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,721
-If you want me to, I will.

271
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,454
SHUICHIRO (VOICEOVER):
That's the kick serve.

272
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:44,354
-Your kick serve
doesn't phase me.

273
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:46,621
-Captain, you're not bad.

274
00:17:54,354 --> 00:17:57,421
SHUICHIRO (VOICEOVER): He
returned that tough kick serve.

275
00:17:57,454 --> 00:17:59,988
That's not easy,
because the ball usually

276
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:02,054
bounces up in your face.

277
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:05,654
But by lowering his
hips for the return,

278
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:09,854
Tezuka turned the kick serve
into just another high ball.

279
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,854
Plus Tezuka returns
it like a half volley

280
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:15,988
so the ball spins even more.

281
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:17,354
He's not playing around.

282
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,621
Tezuka is serious.

283
00:18:19,654 --> 00:18:23,621
-Echizen, why do
you play tennis?

284
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:25,654
Why?

285
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:26,154
Why?

286
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:30,788
-It's like this.

287
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:32,321
There's someone I have to beat.

288
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,954
-You play tennis
just because there's

289
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:45,988
someone you want to beat?

290
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:49,588
Are you satisfied
with that, Echizen?

291
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:50,454
-What do you mean?

292
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:56,888
-What will you have afterwards?

293
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:17,488
And after you beat him,
what are you going to do?

294
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:20,088
Once that's done,
what will you have

295
00:19:20,121 --> 00:19:22,221
left to prove with your tennis?

296
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:24,688
-Can't think about
that right now.

297
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:28,421
I need to focus
on this challenge.

298
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:36,621
SHUICHIRO (VOICEOVER):
Stop it, Tezuka.

299
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:38,521
You shouldn't hit
a drop shot yet.

300
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:01,188
Tezuka.

301
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:17,354
-Echizen, see if
you can beat me.

302
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:27,162
[theme music]

303
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:01,423
RYOMA (VOICEOVER):
I'm Ryoma Echizen,

304
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:03,390
seventh grader at Seigaku.

305
00:21:03,423 --> 00:21:05,623
I'm playing a match
against Captain Tezuka,

306
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:07,990
but my kick serve
doesn't affect him.

307
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:09,390
No wonder he's the captain.

308
00:21:09,423 --> 00:21:11,056
He's a strong player.

309
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,690
But I don't intend to lose.

310
00:21:12,723 --> 00:21:16,823
If you want, I'll show you my
tennis, my own kind of tennis.

You still have a ways to go.
