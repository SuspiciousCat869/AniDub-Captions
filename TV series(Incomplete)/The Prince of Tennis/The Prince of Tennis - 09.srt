00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:09,672
INUI (VOICEOVER): Kick serve.

2
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:12,105
He has to use his
right hand to hit it.

3
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:13,639
But wait.

4
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:17,239
What if he could hit a shot
like that with his weak hand?

5
00:00:17,272 --> 00:00:19,439
What if this kid is
really that good?

6
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,639
I'm not as strong
using my right hand.

7
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:40,404
But I'm aiming for it to go
straight towards your glasses.

00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:11,216
ANNOUNCER: 30-Love.

10
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,482
INUI (VOICEOVER): Shots
coming straight at your body

11
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,367
are the toughest
ones to get out.

12
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,866
To return a kick
serve, the best way

13
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:37,666
is to scoop back the
left leg for the swing,

14
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,666
then step into the shot
from the right foot

15
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,632
and hit a slice while
keeping sideways to the net.

16
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:51,399
Well, so much for theory.

17
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:53,332
-All right, yeah!

18
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:53,832
-Yay!

19
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,899
ANNOUNCER: 40-Love.

20
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:02,166
-If you're gonna
play based on stats,

21
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:05,099
then I'll just figure
out another way.

22
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:08,584
INUI (VOICEOVER): What a jerk.

23
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:10,717
Just a smart aleck rookie.

24
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,717
-He got it.

25
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:18,817
-You still have a ways to go.

26
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:30,817
ANNOUNCER: Game and set to
Echizen, six games to four.

27
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,784
-He won!

28
00:03:31,817 --> 00:03:32,784
He's so cool!

29
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:35,684
Ryoma is amazing!

30
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:36,184
-Wow.

31
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,650
-I can't believe Ryoma won.

32
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:44,850
He's crushed two
regulars already.

33
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:45,750
Not bad.

34
00:03:45,784 --> 00:03:47,050
-Really?

35
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:48,317
-Oh, hi, Momoshiro.

36
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,150
-I said to call me Momo.

37
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:53,550
Wow, Ryoma's pretty good
to take apart Sadaharu.

38
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,984
He's picked up his kick serve
since the last time we played.

39
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,250
-Sorry I got kinda mad,
but it was a great game.

40
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:11,084
-I gathered good data.

41
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,117
Just don't get it.

42
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,484
I should have won.

43
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:14,884
Must have used the wrong foot.

44
00:04:18,184 --> 00:04:20,117
-I don't ever want to
play that guy again.

45
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,484
-How do you do it
every single time?

46
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:26,850
-Awesome!

47
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:29,250
I knew you were gonna to win
that one from the very start.

48
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:32,550
-Horio, you sure seem to
change your mind an awful lot.

49
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,017
KAIDOH: Sh.

50
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,384
You're bothering me.

51
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:37,050
Why don't you guys shut up?

52
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:37,550
-Yes sir.

53
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:44,817
-Let's go, Ryoma.

54
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,084
Four matches undefeated!

55
00:04:48,117 --> 00:04:49,584
ANNOUNCER: Game to Echizen.

56
00:04:49,617 --> 00:04:51,850
Game to Echizen.

57
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:54,884
Game to Echizen.

58
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:59,150
Game and set to Echizen,
six games to Love.

59
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:01,584
-Wow, he did it!

60
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:03,250
-You guys know what that means?

61
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:04,650
Four matches won!

62
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:07,217
-Yeah, now he's a regular!

63
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,117
-Regular?

64
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,884
-It's too wonderful!

65
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:13,150
We'll have to congratulate
him later, right, Sakuno?

66
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:13,717
-Yes.

67
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,417
Yes, we will.

68
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,250
-Aw, man.

69
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:18,150
That guy has no mercy.

70
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:23,917
-Come on, he's right here!

71
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,917
Um, Ryoma.

72
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,084
It's cool that you're a--

73
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:30,550
-Hey, punk.

74
00:05:30,584 --> 00:05:31,517
Move it.

75
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:40,617
-The last regular slot
is on the line here.

76
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,350
Each player has two wins.

77
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,417
-It's a tough call, but
probably Sadaharu will take it.

78
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,650
He's won every time
they played so far.

79
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:02,850
-The angle of his
snake shot has changed.

80
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:11,517
ANNOUNCER: Game and
set goes to Kaidoh.

81
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,617
Seven games to five.

82
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,717
-Tough luck, pal.

83
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:22,017
-It makes no sense.

84
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,517
My data appears to
have let me down.

85
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,217
-Did you see all the top
spin Kaidoh put on the ball?

86
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,650
It was the coolest-- Oh!

87
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:34,550
-Looks like we're going to
have a strong team after all.

88
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:35,750
-Yeah.

89
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:40,217
-Well, now the eight
regulars have been decided.

90
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,950
-Captain Kunimitsu
Tezuka, ninth grade.

91
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:50,084
Co-captain Shuiciro
Oichi, also ninth grade.

92
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:54,550
Shusuke Fuji, ninth grade.

93
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:59,150
Takashi Kawamura, ninth grade.

00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:03,250

95
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:06,750
Takeshi Momoshiro, eighth grade.

96
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:11,017
Kaoru Kaidoh, the eighth grade.

97
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,250
And the only seventh grade
regular, Ryoma Echizen.

98
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,117
-I can't take it.

99
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,317
We're just not strong
enough to play the regulars.

100
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,017
-Ryoma.

101
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,250
Write your size on this.

102
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,517
-My size?

103
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,450
-Oh.

104
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,284
You know, that's
for your uniform.

105
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:35,650
-That's right.

106
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:37,117
It's gonna have youe name on
the back of it and everything.

107
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,850
KACHIRO: Oh, man.

108
00:07:37,884 --> 00:07:39,050
That so rocks!

109
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:44,850
You have no idea how
cool this is, Ryoma.

110
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:48,150
You're the only seventh
grader with a team shirt.

111
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:48,984
-Oh man.

112
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:50,684
I wonder if I'll ever get one.

113
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:52,317
-Aw, no problem.

114
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,917
Once our senior
students graduate.

115
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,584
Whoa.

116
00:07:55,617 --> 00:07:56,150
-Sakuno.

117
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,117
-Hey, what's up?

118
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,550
-Uh, I mean, Ryoma,
about the team.

119
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:02,517
-Hi!

120
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,984
Hey, Ryoma!

121
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,450
What's going on around here?

122
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:07,950
I hate to miss anything.

123
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:09,417
I can't stand it!

124
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,350
Congratulations on
making the team, Ryoma.

125
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:12,684
-Um.

126
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:14,750
-As president of your fan
club and your number one fan,

127
00:08:14,784 --> 00:08:15,384
I'm so proud!

128
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:17,284
You too, huh girl?

129
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:18,217
-Well, yes.

130
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,617
Ryoma, I think that you--

131
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,617
-Oh, I know.

132
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,984
Why don't we go
somewhere to celebrate?

133
00:08:23,017 --> 00:08:25,250
We'll have a big party,
'cause Ryoma's gonna

134
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:25,984
be a team regular.

135
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:26,984
So big!

136
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:27,984
-You're joking.

137
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:29,117
-Not at all.

138
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,684
We have to celebrate
special days like this.

139
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:33,150
Hey, what's up?

140
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:38,561
Hey, Ryoma!

141
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:39,940
Wait up for us!

142
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:40,874
-Ryoma!

143
00:08:40,907 --> 00:08:41,874
-Echizen!

144
00:08:41,907 --> 00:08:44,580
-Ryoma, I, um, wanted
to say to you--

145
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:48,039
[whine]

146
00:08:56,592 --> 00:08:58,758
I just wanted you to
know how impressive I

147
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:01,892
think it is that
you made the-- Huh?

148
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:06,258
-Echizen?

149
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,225
-Well, yes.

150
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:10,692
I thought he might be hanging
around here during lunch,

151
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:12,225
'cause he's a
member of the team.

152
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:14,158
A regular now.

153
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:15,725
-I haven't seen him around.

154
00:09:15,758 --> 00:09:17,258
He might be out on the courts.

155
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:17,892
-Oh.

156
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:20,192
Thank you so much.

157
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:21,392
-Echizen?

158
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:22,892
No, I haven't seen him.

159
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:24,192
-Any ideas?

160
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:25,325
-What a flirt.

161
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:26,792
Are you gonna confess
undying love for him.

162
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:27,425
-No!

163
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,692
Nothing like that.

164
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:30,858
-Ah, puppy love.

165
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:33,925
Oh to be young and in love.

166
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,525
-She's only one year
younger than you are.

167
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:40,292
-You know, you team
members work really hard.

168
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:43,225
Practicing on lunch
break and everything.

169
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:44,825
Nothing better to do.

170
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:46,425
We're just killing some time.

171
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,925
-For me, it's all
about beating this guy.

172
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,325
So let's play, Momo.

173
00:09:50,358 --> 00:09:50,925
-All right.

174
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:09,158
-Wow.

175
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,825
The regulars are amazing.

176
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:13,258
I can't believe Ryoma made it.

177
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:14,692
Ah!

178
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:16,625
Oh, I'm-- I'm so sorry.

179
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:24,458
-Oh, Ryoma Echizen, where
could you have gone?

180
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:48,315
-Seigaku!

181
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:51,749
Fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight!

182
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:54,401
-Seventh graders,
I can't hear you.

183
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:55,368
-Sir!

184
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:57,568
-Our a regulars
sure do have spirit.

185
00:10:57,601 --> 00:10:58,934
-Of course they do.

186
00:10:58,968 --> 00:11:01,734
And the district prelims
are coming up soon.

187
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:03,501
-We'll win 'em.

188
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:06,134
What are you girls doing
here, watching again?

189
00:11:06,168 --> 00:11:07,768
-We're not watching.

190
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:08,334
Oh, no.

191
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,001
We're cheering.

192
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:15,568
There he is! my dreamboat!

193
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,268
-Hey, you, over there!

194
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,301
-Wha--

195
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:20,001
-Pick up balls, and
stop your gabbing.

196
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:20,868
Here.

197
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:21,768
Here!

198
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:22,601
Come on, guys.

199
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:25,268
Pick up the paste.

200
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:28,434
-I can't believe your
grandma's so scary.

201
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:30,601
-Aw, she usually.

202
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:31,734
Just now.

203
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:36,001
-Team, time to line up.

204
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:38,268
-Now that, I don't
have to remind you all

205
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:41,201
that the metro tournament
is right around the corner.

206
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:44,368
The eighth regular members
we chose through our interest

207
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:46,668
squad tournament will
compete as a team

208
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:48,334
through the metro tournament.

209
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:53,434
Every school has raised its
level of play since last year.

210
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:56,268
We cannot take
anything for granted.

211
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:57,634
That's it.

212
00:11:57,668 --> 00:12:00,601
-Everyone, back to practice
eighth and ninth graders court

213
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:01,501
see em.

214
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:02,768
-Regulars, practice serves.

215
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:03,501
-All righty, then!

216
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:04,268
Said!

217
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,501
-Just a minute, many guys.

218
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:08,068
For your regular
team members, I've

219
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:11,401
asked this young
man here to plan out

220
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:15,268
a very, very special practice
regiment for the team.

221
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:20,601
-Sadaharu?

222
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:21,801
-Hello.

223
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:24,468
To get through the long
match scheduled nationads,

224
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:27,501
We'll start with lower
body strength training.

225
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:29,234
These are ankle weights.

226
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:31,934
There are two half
pound lead bars in each.

227
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:34,701
They'll get your legs a
little bit better resistance.

228
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,834
-You know, that's
not much weight.

229
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:42,701
INUI: I also set out red,
blue, and yellow cones,

230
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:45,301
and made up lots of
these balls I colored

231
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:48,134
with red, blue,
and yellow lines.

232
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,001
-OK.

233
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,368
Sure, I got it.

234
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:52,568
-If you miss, you're gone.

235
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:55,701
Here we go, Eiji.

236
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:56,201
-It's red.

237
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:01,134
It's red!

238
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,168
-Whoa!

239
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,701
Look at the control he has!

240
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:08,201
-Blue!

241
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:12,768
-What an eye.

242
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:15,334
It's amazing how he tracks
the color just a second

243
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:19,001
after Sadaharu hits it.

244
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:20,968
-Yellow!

245
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:24,634
-Then he hits it back perfectly
to the same color cone.

246
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:28,301
No one's better than Eiji
at attracting moving object.

247
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:29,868
There is.

248
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,734
Look there.

249
00:13:31,768 --> 00:13:34,034
He's better.

250
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:36,901
Red!

251
00:13:36,934 --> 00:13:39,301
Huh?

252
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:43,234
Sakuno, they're not just
hitting them really hard.

253
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:44,668
Lookit!

254
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:48,801
They're smashing the balls, and
hitting the same color cones.

255
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:49,701
-I know!

256
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:51,501
Can that be possible?

257
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:53,501
-They're both doing pretty well.

258
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:54,768
-It shouldn't be well long now.

259
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:01,234
They're going to feel
those ankle weights.

260
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:03,701
-My legs feel like
they weigh a ton.

261
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:05,534
Now I get it OK.

262
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:07,634
OK, it's red.

263
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:09,234
-Sorry, that's blue.

264
00:14:09,268 --> 00:14:10,034
-No way!

265
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:12,301
I know it's red.

266
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:13,968
Why'd you do that?

267
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:14,568
It was red.

268
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:15,868
I was right.

269
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:17,734
You tricked me, Sadaharu!

270
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:21,801
-When your stamina goes,
so does your judgment.

271
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,501
Kikumaru, you're out.

272
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:27,234
Oh, and I forgot to tell
you something If, you miss,

273
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:30,301
you get to drink my extra
special vegetable juice.

274
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:35,568
-What's up?

275
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:37,568
Why is it that strange
I don't you worry?

276
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:38,268
It's all edible.

277
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:43,734
Come on, drink it all, hotshot.

278
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:00,168
-What is this stuff?

279
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:00,834
Water!

280
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:02,001
Water!

281
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:02,968
-Ryoma!

282
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:03,468
-Huh?

283
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,034
-What you waiting for, guys?

284
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:23,001
You're next.

285
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:26,234
-I can't afford any mistakes.

286
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:27,868
It's red!

287
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:29,134
Blue!

288
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:31,834
Shuichiro is good.

289
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:35,468
That's one scope the kind
of quiet butcher can hit.

290
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:45,301
-[screaming]

291
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:47,668
-Here's your racket, pal.

292
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:49,834
-Gee, thanks.

293
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:51,901
-It's red!

294
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:53,859
-He's certainly a noisy player.

295
00:15:53,892 --> 00:15:55,626
-Be he sure is a good.

296
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:58,492
His personality sure changes
when he gets on the court,

297
00:15:58,526 --> 00:15:59,559
doesn't it?

298
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:00,492
-Yep.

299
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,792
-OK, red ball!

300
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,226
-Red!

301
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:08,626
-That's great.

302
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:09,892
He's so good.

303
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:12,626
-Momo can really power
one over the next.

304
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:13,126
-Blue!

305
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:19,992
-Steak shot!

306
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:21,392
Right in one.

307
00:16:21,426 --> 00:16:22,792
Kaidoh did it.

308
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:23,292
-Red ball.

309
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,359
[groaning]

310
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:40,059
-Kaidoh couldn't even
take that awful cocktail.

311
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:42,926
-That juice looked
absolutely disgusting.

312
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:43,826
Bleh.

313
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:44,659
-Huh?

314
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:48,259
Shusuke messed up, too.

315
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,959
-Shusuke, you did
that on purpose!

316
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:52,492
I wanted to try this goop.

317
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:01,726
It's really not all
that gross, you know?

318
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,726
It's good.

319
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,392
-Liar.

320
00:17:03,426 --> 00:17:04,559
It stinks.

321
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:06,626
-Man, it's hard to believe that.

322
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,126
He drink drank that stuff.

323
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:12,126
Will moved better
than I expected.

324
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:13,926
To the amount of who
you lost your grip.

325
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,492
When you hit the ball.

326
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:18,859
A little weight training will
strengthen those forearms.

327
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:22,292
-So Ichiro and Kaorou, you
guys are having trouble

328
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:24,492
getting your racket
around the ball.

329
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:27,826
All of you clowns need to work
on your quads and triceps.

330
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,192
-We don't even know
where they are.

331
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:32,692
-Momoshiro, pull back
your power a little,

332
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:34,792
and you'll increase
your accuracy.

333
00:17:34,826 --> 00:17:36,092
-Right.

334
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:39,259
Kunumitzu, you didn't miss,
but you need flexibility,

335
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:42,726
and you're too serious.

336
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,692
And last, Ryoma.

337
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:47,159
Drink two of these a day.

338
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,559
-You can't make me grow, no
matter how much milk I drink.

339
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:51,359
-Drink it up.

340
00:17:51,392 --> 00:17:52,526
-I wouldn't argue with him.

341
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,159
It really does work.

342
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:56,692
-He sure is living
proof of that.

343
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:58,792
-Let's get back to work, guys.

344
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:00,992
We'll add one lead
weight to your ankles.

345
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:02,759
-Hang on a second.

346
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,526
-Just add five.

347
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,259
-Huh?

348
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:08,126
-Isn't that what you're using?

349
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,692
-Seems maybe to me going
to get to five eventually.

350
00:18:10,726 --> 00:18:11,959
What do you think?

351
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:12,926
-Even six would be

352
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:13,559
OK.

353
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,226
You are also slow.

354
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:14,926
Think 10.

355
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,292
-That's not fair.

356
00:18:19,326 --> 00:18:20,392
I didn't sign on for this.

357
00:18:20,426 --> 00:18:21,359
Quit messing with us.

358
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,792
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER):
Building stamina

359
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:26,026
will improve their games a
lot, but the biggest weapon

360
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:28,359
they have is--

361
00:18:28,392 --> 00:18:30,926
-Kunimitsu, don't
overdo it right now.

362
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,526
I'm going you healthy
for the season.

363
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,492
Even my worry is that
we win every single one

364
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:37,659
of our tournaments.

365
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:40,126
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER):
Their desire to improve.

366
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:44,192
It's amazing how he got such
a competitive group together.

367
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:45,992
OK, back to practice.

368
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:48,892
Our goal is to be the
number one seated school!

369
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:49,592
-Seigaku!

370
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:50,092
Right!

371
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,592
-Well, this has
gotta be a mistake.

372
00:18:57,626 --> 00:18:59,226
This shirt is a small.

373
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:02,392
-We've always supplied the
tennis uniforms for Seigaku,

374
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:04,526
but this one's a first.

375
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,692
Ah, come right in.

376
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,159
-It's just amazing.

377
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,859
Our regulars rock.

378
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:14,692
Don't you think so, Kachiro?

379
00:19:14,726 --> 00:19:15,492
-Yeah.

380
00:19:15,526 --> 00:19:16,559
Uh-huh.

381
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:18,926
Have you seen how well
Ryoma is keeping up

382
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,259
with the regular team?

383
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,192
-It sort of seems like he's
in a whole different world.

384
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:29,914
-Ryoma!

385
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:35,726
So, tell me, is that
your new uniform?

386
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,092
-Yeah, I just got it.

387
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:38,426
-Wow.

388
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:39,726
That's great.

389
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,192
It'll look wonderful.

390
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:42,559
Can I see it on?

391
00:19:42,592 --> 00:19:44,059
-Yeah, I'll have it on tomorrow.

392
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:45,226
-Oh.

393
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:46,926
That's right.

394
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,359
I forgot about practice.

395
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:56,159
-Hm.

396
00:19:56,192 --> 00:19:56,792
Just right.

397
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:09,059
-Ryoma, congratulations
on the team!

398
00:20:09,092 --> 00:20:10,310
-Thanks.

399
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:30,665
[theme music]

400
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,029
-I'm Sasabe.

401
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:02,563
Been a while right?

402
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,263
Remember me, everybody?

403
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,963
I was the first one to play
that kid Ryoma in a match.

404
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:10,363
Got to admit it,
but this time it's

405
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:13,029
war between that
punk and my dad.

406
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,996
Hey, hey, Pops, you're taking
the spotlight away from me.

407
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:20,963
Next, on "The Prince of Tennis,"
Sounter Attack, Sasabe Again.

408
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:22,996
See what life in the
Sasabe family is like!
