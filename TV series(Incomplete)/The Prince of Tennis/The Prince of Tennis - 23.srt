00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:17,575
OISHI: No!

2
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:21,742
FUJI: Whoa.

3
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:22,575
KIKUMARU: Oishi.

4
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:23,409
Oishi.

5
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:24,809
FUJI: Oishi, are you OK, man?

6
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:25,642
Whoa.

7
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:28,175
KIKUMARU: Oishi, get a grip.

8
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:31,175
[theme music]

9
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:43,565
KACHIRO (VOICEOVER):
It was on a day

10
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,199
when we were practicing
for the Metro matches

11
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:50,699
when we saw it for
the first time.

12
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:54,899
KACHIRO: Oh man, I can't find
that ball anywhere, can you?

13
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:55,865
MIZUNO: Let's give up.

14
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:58,399
I'm tired.

15
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:00,299
HORIO: Getting tired is
totally unacceptable.

16
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:03,465
You're not even on the team yet.

17
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,399
MIZUNO: I know, but--

18
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:06,599
-Quit your whining.

19
00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:11,665
Segaku team members aren't
allowed to give up ever.

20
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,265
-OK, Horio, I get it.

21
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:16,832
-Hey, who's that guy?

22
00:02:16,865 --> 00:02:17,799
Over there.

23
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:19,265
-Huh?

24
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,132
Hey, what's he doing over there.

25
00:02:21,165 --> 00:02:24,432
-He seems to be
digging for something.

26
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:28,299
ALL: Oh, it's-- it's Sadaharu.

27
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,265
-What's he doing?

28
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:36,832
That's weird.

29
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:42,832
[chatter]

30
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,532
-OK, regulars, over here.

31
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:49,865
ALL: Hm?

32
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:51,832
-We've got nine
days until Metros.

33
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:55,699
From now on, we're all going
to be training in a new way.

34
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:58,365
You will rally the
ball in a limited area.

35
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,932
The name for this
is zone training.

36
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:02,032
-You know what?

37
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:03,532
That sounds like fun.

38
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:05,865
-Yeah.

39
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:08,265
-Until the Metros,
you will split up

40
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:10,099
according to game style.

41
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:12,999
There are the counter-punchers
who stay on the baseline

42
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:15,999
and hit steady, sure shots,
and wait for their opponent

43
00:03:16,032 --> 00:03:17,565
to make a mistake.

44
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,899
Players like Kaido,
Fuji, and Oishi.

45
00:03:21,932 --> 00:03:24,732
Then there are the players
who stay at the baseline

46
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:27,999
too, but use more power
to attack their opponents.

47
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:31,099
Guys like Kawamura
and Momoshiro.

48
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:34,499
There are those who use
quick thinking and reflexes

49
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:36,565
and play most of their
points at the net--

50
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,399
the serve and volley players.

51
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:40,365
That's Kikumaru.

52
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:42,532
Finally, we have
all-around players

53
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:44,465
like Tezuka and Echizen.

54
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:46,399
Their superior
conditioning allows

55
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:49,565
them to use all
these techniques.

56
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,232
Today, the counter-punchers
and serve-and-volleyers--

57
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,532
that is Oishi, Fuji,
Kaido, and Kikumaru--

58
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:57,899
you will defend the whole court.

59
00:03:57,932 --> 00:04:00,965
Aggressive baseliners
and all-around players--

60
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:04,165
Kawamura, Momoshiro,
Kikumaru, Tezuka,

61
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,232
and Echizen-- you
are going to attack

62
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:09,065
from the back half of the court.

63
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,665
It's a five rally format.

64
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,065
If you're playing
the whole court,

65
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,199
you'll return to the
back half of the court.

66
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:17,832
If the ball goes anywhere
else, you're automatically out.

67
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:20,232
And if you're attacking
from the back court,

68
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:22,132
then you will have
to win the point

69
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:26,499
before the ball is
returned five times.

70
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,199
-So what you're
really trying to say

71
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:32,032
is put the ball away in
the first five shots.

72
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:33,199
INUI: That is correct.

73
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,165
-Wait, let me understand--
if we're on defense,

74
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,399
and if we play the
ball five times, then

75
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:39,032
does that mean we win?

76
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:43,032
-Yes, but guys, if
you lose, you have

77
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:45,765
to drink my special
vegetable juice.

78
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:46,232
-Huh?

79
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:56,065
[groaning]

80
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,865
-Bwah, what is that?

81
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:03,332
-It's red.

82
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:13,732
[groaning]

83
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,299
-Now, let's get to work.

84
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:23,499
-Holy cow.

85
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,532
It looks like they're
going straight in playoffs.

86
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:27,065
-That's so cool.

87
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:30,365
KACHIRO: OK, first up is
Kawamura versus Kaido.

88
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,932
MIZUNO: They're starting
with a really tough pair.

89
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,765
HORIO: Yeah, they're
pitting power players

90
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,265
against unpredictable ones.

91
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:38,765
-And just so it
will be fair, I am

92
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:40,965
going to feed the first ball.

93
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:44,432
[hiss]

94
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:47,065
-What's that supposed to
mean, you little snake?

95
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:52,332
Let's bring it on.

96
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:55,165
You're not going to
believe my burning shot.

97
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,865
Don't get too scared.

98
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,932
KAIDO (VOICEOVER):
Why you little--

99
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:01,732
-OK, ready?

100
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:02,232
Go.

101
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,965
-Well, Kaido's suddenly
showing spirit.

102
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:12,232
-Snake!

103
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,632
-That won't work, Viper.

104
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:19,565
Not when I've got this.

105
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,099
In your face!

106
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,932
Watch this!

107
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:34,132
-Wow, what power.

108
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:35,399
-Kaido's taking a beating.

109
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:37,332
KAWAMURA: Oh yeah,
oh yeah, oh yeah!

110
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:39,665
-Looks like Snake's style
is making the other guy

111
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,232
run from corner to corner.

112
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:42,632
KAWAMURA: Come on.

113
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:47,132
-If he can only hit to half the
court, it's going to be hard.

114
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:48,599
KAWAMURA: Take that!

115
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:49,999
-That's some rally.

116
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:50,499
-Wow.

117
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,965
-Kaido's going to
use his snake shot.

118
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,132
He's supposed to play defense.

119
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:00,599
-Hang in there, Kaido.

120
00:07:00,632 --> 00:07:04,132
Defend your court.

121
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:05,665
KAIDO (VOICEOVER):
Man, what power.

122
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,465
He's just killing me
with that heat of his.

123
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:11,432
-Last one, yeah!

124
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:14,932
Ready and burning!

125
00:07:14,965 --> 00:07:17,332
-Man, what a great return.

126
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:18,799
MIZUNO: Kaido will
never get to it.

127
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:21,632
KAIDO (VOICEOVER): Forget
defending and attacking,

128
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:23,099
I'm going to win this.

129
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:29,599
-See that?

130
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:30,465
His boomerang snake.

131
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:35,765
KAWAMURA: Out!

132
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,132
-That's too bad.

133
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,532
Looks like Kaido just
couldn't handle the heat.

134
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:41,099
-OK, Taka!

135
00:07:41,132 --> 00:07:42,399
You rule!

136
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:42,932
Delicious!

137
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,232
Victory, hee yah!

138
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:50,599
[sigh]

139
00:07:50,632 --> 00:07:52,032
-Huh?

140
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:53,465
Ugh, no.

141
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:59,432
-Next, full court, Oishi.

142
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:01,065
Half court, Momo.

143
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:03,532
-Hey, let's go easy.

144
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:04,265
-You got it.

145
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:06,999
[panicking]

146
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:10,932
[gagging]

147
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:11,699
STUDENT 1: Oh man.

148
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:12,899
STUDENT 2: Hey, is he all right?

149
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:13,832
STUDENT 3: What on earth
did you make him drink?

150
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:15,165
STUDENT 1: Hey,
Kaido, you OK, bro?

151
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,565
STUDENT 4: Kaido, are you OK?

152
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,499
-Well.

153
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:19,999
-I'm not losing this.

154
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:24,099
-Well, well, Oishi.

155
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:26,365
It looks like you're
hanging in there.

156
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,799
OISHI (VOICEOVER):
When did Momoshiro

157
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:35,265
start hitting so hard?

158
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:42,232
-Oh no!

159
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:45,665
-My friend, I'm not
wearing weights today.

160
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:47,599
So I can do this.

161
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:52,865
-Oh, cool.

162
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:53,832
Jumping smash.

163
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:55,165
-Oishi's going down.

164
00:08:57,932 --> 00:08:58,899
-Oh yeah.

165
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:07,265
OISHI (VOICEOVER):
Wow, Momoshiro really

166
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:12,199
upped the power on
that jump smash.

167
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:15,099
[chatter]

168
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,265
OISHI: No!

169
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:30,065
FUJI: Oishi?

170
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:31,132
KIKUMARU: Oishi, Oishi.

171
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:32,065
FUJI: Oh man, you OK?

172
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:38,665
-Oishi, get a grip.

173
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:39,332
-Phew.

174
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:40,799
Glad that's not me.

175
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:42,932
I definitely don't want
to drink that nasty stuff.

176
00:09:58,332 --> 00:09:59,099
KAWAMURA: Huh?

177
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,399
It can't be.

178
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:01,565
It's over already?

179
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,899
MOMOSHIRO: Should have known.

180
00:10:02,932 --> 00:10:06,732
There's a reason
Tezuka's captain.

181
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:10,399
-Hey, Tezuka, you
really meant that?

182
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:11,232
-Yes, of course.

183
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,165
-So close.

184
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,632
It would have been fun to see
the Captain drink that stuff.

185
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:22,932
-Wow, you sure did get
that over with quickly.

186
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:25,765
-Yeah, I really wanted to
drink that stuff again.

187
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:30,165
-Hm?

188
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:32,299
FUJI: Huh, it says Tezuka.

189
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:32,799
INUI: Oh.

190
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:35,832
Hm.

191
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:42,865
Oh.

192
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,199
[gulping]

193
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:52,632
-Hey, stop staring.

194
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:55,332
Hurry up and start
the next game.

195
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:56,265
-Wow, man.

196
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:58,365
-How did he drink that stuff?

197
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,799
-It doesn't affect him.

198
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:04,632
-It can't be helped.

199
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,799
I was going to save
this for Nationals,

200
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,132
but I think it's
time to bring it out.

201
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:12,399
I finished this yesterday.

202
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:16,765
My new elixir is called
Special Golden Power Mix Drink.

203
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,599
-Elixir?

204
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:20,699
-Just what on earth's in it?

205
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:21,632
-Is that to drink?

206
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:27,232
-Looks like Inui's
made a new potion.

207
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:30,665
-Yeah, and I bet there's
more than vegetables in it.

208
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:31,999
[gasp]

209
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:36,699
MIZUNO: That day we saw him.

210
00:11:36,732 --> 00:11:38,665
-Wah!

211
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:43,065
[chatter]

212
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:44,899
-What should we do?

213
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:46,265
-Not telling would work.

214
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:54,499
-Hey, I'm not
drinking that stuff.

215
00:11:54,532 --> 00:11:56,065
No way.

216
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:58,132
-Why be so polite?

217
00:11:58,165 --> 00:11:59,632
You want to know something?

218
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:01,999
It really looked sort of good.

219
00:12:02,032 --> 00:12:03,199
MIZUNO: Uh oh.

220
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:04,932
Next is the battle between
Echizen and Kikumaru.

221
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:24,012
-Hey, I'm not
drinking that stuff.

222
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:25,745
No way.

223
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,312
-Why be so polite?

224
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:29,345
You want to know something?

225
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:30,612
It really looked sort of good.

226
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:56,045
-Go!

227
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,645
-At least I'm not going
to lose to the little guy.

228
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,412
Take that.

229
00:13:04,445 --> 00:13:05,379
I got this one.

230
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:12,012
-Hey, he's already
charging the net.

231
00:13:12,045 --> 00:13:13,645
-I don't know.

232
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,279
Eiji really thinks his net game
is going to win it for him.

233
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:19,345
-Off to a good start.

234
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:20,579
No doubt about it.

235
00:13:20,612 --> 00:13:23,279
MIZUNO: The corner,
ah, good placement.

236
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:24,112
-Got it.

237
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:25,845
Easy.

238
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,712
There's the first ball.

239
00:13:28,745 --> 00:13:30,112
-That's cool.

240
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:32,079
Look at the way Kikumaru
dove for that ball.

241
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:32,579
-Yeah.

242
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:42,579
-Good job, Echizen!

243
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:43,912
You held him off.

244
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:45,845
-You're wasting your time.

245
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:53,345
And that would be
ball number two.

246
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:55,845
-Man, Kikumaru has
incredible reflexes.

247
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:58,645
-He can return just
about anything.

248
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,845
-Then where do you think
Ryoma should hit the ball to?

249
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,012
INUI (VOICEOVER): This
five ball rally exercise

250
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:08,179
was supposed to teach Kikumaru
to hang tough next time Echizen

251
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:09,512
challenges him.

252
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:13,879
But this is turning out
to be just what he likes.

253
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:16,912
It's hard enough for
Echizen to pass Kikumaru

254
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:20,145
from the baseline,
but when he does,

255
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:23,545
that sets up our acrobat with
some pretty impressive gets.

256
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:27,845
I guess my plan backfired.

257
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,512
-Hey, Echizen isn't on
the ropes quite yet.

258
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:36,012
-Three balls left.

259
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:37,812
MOMOSHIRO (VOICEOVER):
So Echizen,

260
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:40,945
what are you going
to do now, huh?

261
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:42,012
-There's ball three.

262
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:46,112
-Huh?

263
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:48,312
No way.

264
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,212
Now, now.

265
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:51,145
That wasn't a very nice shot.

266
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:53,879
-Huh?

267
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:54,679
-Wow.

268
00:14:54,712 --> 00:14:55,712
Echizen's going to the net.

269
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:56,645
-That's nuts.

270
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,412
-Good choice, Echizen.

271
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,245
-Sorry.

272
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,045
One thing I forgot to mention.

273
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,445
-Huh?

274
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:12,545
-When the half court player goes
to the net, from that point on,

275
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:17,212
he has to defend
the entire court.

276
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:17,912
-What?

277
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:18,845
But--

278
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,145
-Really?

279
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:21,045
-That's the rule.

280
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:22,912
Sorry about that, little guy.

281
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:28,612
That ball's headed
into next week.

282
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:32,345
-Good shot.

283
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:33,612
A lob to the corner.

284
00:15:36,345 --> 00:15:38,145
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): This stinks.

285
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:39,245
-Don't worry.

286
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,179
He can get that.

287
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:41,945
-Yeah.

288
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:43,245
That's not all.

289
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,345
He's headed straight toward
Inui and the ball basket.

290
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:49,545
-Hm.

291
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:59,979
-Wow, he totally doesn't care.

292
00:16:00,012 --> 00:16:01,479
-That's crazy.

293
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:02,579
Ryoma!

294
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:05,412
HORIO: Oh, with his back
to the net, even Echizen

295
00:16:05,445 --> 00:16:06,912
can't return the ball.

296
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,845
-I've always wanted to try this.

297
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,912
-Is he serious?

298
00:16:21,945 --> 00:16:22,912
No way.

299
00:16:22,945 --> 00:16:27,445
He just hit it
between the leg shot.

300
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:29,445
-All right.

301
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:29,945
-What?

302
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:39,312
KIKUMARU (VOICEOVER):
Didn't think he had it.

303
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:43,445
-What a quick recovery.

304
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,212
-You bet.

305
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:47,079
Here's a chance for Ryoma.

306
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:49,079
-Hey, little one.

307
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:51,445
V. Victory after five balls.

308
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,779
Heh heh, yay!

309
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:56,712
I won the game!

310
00:16:56,745 --> 00:16:59,145
Oh.

311
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:00,045
Come on, Echizen.

312
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,612
What are you doing?

313
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,912
Huh?

314
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:05,179
Inui, give this kid a full
glass of the new weird drink

315
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:06,112
you concocted.

316
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:06,845
Make it two.

317
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,745
-And here it is, my Special
Golden Power Mix Elixir.

318
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:17,545
[gagging]

319
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:22,345
[groaning]

320
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:24,279
-Shoot me.

321
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:26,745
I can't believe we had
to drink that garbage.

322
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:32,745
-Disgusting.

323
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,345
-Hey, look.

324
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:44,245
Coach Ryuzaki.

325
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:46,112
-Team meeting, guys.

326
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:47,679
I've got the lineup
for the Metros.

327
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:52,212
Huh?

328
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:54,779
Some of the players are missing.

329
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:59,779
-Oh, the truth is Inui's
special new power drink--

330
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,512
-Hm?

331
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:05,779
-It's my Special Golden
Power Mix Elixir.

332
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:07,345
It's the newest version.

333
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:08,512
You care to try it?

334
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:13,312
-Not right now, thanks.

335
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:19,879
There are 108 schools.

336
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:23,079
They're all tough opponents.

337
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:26,279
Of all these, there
will only be five teams

338
00:18:26,312 --> 00:18:30,179
that will go onto
the Kanto Tournament.

339
00:18:30,212 --> 00:18:31,245
-Hey, look.

340
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,545
Fudomine will play
Hyotei before we do.

341
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:36,612
-It looks like we might
play your little brother's

342
00:18:36,645 --> 00:18:38,979
school, St. Rudolph's, huh Fuji?

343
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:39,479
-Mhm.

344
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:49,979
-So then.

345
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:51,645
There are nine days left.

346
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,579
That is it.

347
00:18:52,612 --> 00:18:53,945
We only want first place.

348
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,145
Give it your best.

349
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:56,245
ALL: Right.

350
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,812
-OK, back to work.

351
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,812
Time for combination practice.

352
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:03,545
-And for those of you
without enough motivation,

353
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:04,645
this will be waiting.

354
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:14,179
[chatter]

355
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:16,712
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER):
So for this tournament,

356
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:18,445
we'll have the seventh
and eighth grade

357
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:23,312
trio of Kaido,
Momoshiro, and Echizen.

358
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:27,112
In this short of a time,
they've made great progress.

359
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:31,079
I hope they'll kick butt.

360
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:33,612
The Metro Tournament
should be very interesting.

361
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:38,812
-Hm.

362
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:39,312
Huh?

363
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:50,612
MIZUNO: It's just no good.

364
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:51,945
We can't find it, Horio.

365
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:54,145
HORIO: Come on, get with it.

366
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,145
With that attitude, you'll
never get to be a regular.

367
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,979
KACHIRO: Give us a break, Horio.

368
00:19:59,012 --> 00:20:00,112
-Enough.

369
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:02,779
Now the next one who
whines will get this.

370
00:20:02,812 --> 00:20:07,245
Horio's new and improved
Ridiculously Powerful Super

371
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,112
Elixir.

372
00:20:09,145 --> 00:20:10,512
BOTH: Don't kid us.

373
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:12,745
KACHIRO: No way I'm
drinking that, Horio.

374
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,612
MIZUNO: What's with
that color anyway?

375
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:16,379
KACHIRO: Here, you
drink it yourself then.

376
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:16,845
HORIO: Hey, you punks.

377
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:17,645
Stop it.

378
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,379
KACHIRO: Go on, bottoms up.

379
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:19,212
HORIO: You know what?

380
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:20,012
I've got two years of tennis.

381
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:21,645
You know-- Ugh!

382
00:20:24,145 --> 00:20:27,078
[theme music]

383
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:57,611
NANAKO (VOICEOVER):
Hello, everybody.

384
00:20:57,645 --> 00:21:00,445
I'm Nanjiro Echizen's
neice, Nanako.

385
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:02,245
How are you all?

386
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:06,145
Uh, Uncle, where are
you going before dinner?

387
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:07,078
What?

388
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:09,011
Ryoma's got a date?

389
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:10,945
And you're following them?

390
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:15,311
I wonder who this girl is.

391
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:19,245
Next on the Prince of
Tennis-- "Ryoma's Day Off."

392
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,478
Uncle, this is so embarrassing.

393
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:23,445
Please stop.
