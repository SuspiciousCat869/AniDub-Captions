1
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,913
-The semifinals
are finally here.

2
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:16,880
-Sure are.

3
00:00:16,913 --> 00:00:17,780
-Hey, there.

4
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:18,513
Sorry I'm late.

5
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:20,546
-Morning.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,180
-Hey.

7
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:23,780
You're all early.

8
00:00:23,813 --> 00:00:25,313
-You're just crazy.

9
00:00:25,346 --> 00:00:27,213
-So, Kaidoh, you
want to fight me?

10
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:28,213
[hiss]

11
00:00:28,246 --> 00:00:30,780
-Knock it off, you guys.

12
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:33,046
-It looks like
Echizen is missing.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,180
-Yeah, where is he?

14
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:35,680
-He's late again.

15
00:00:35,713 --> 00:00:37,046
-Oh, please.

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,713
-See?

17
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,113
He's here.

18
00:00:39,146 --> 00:00:40,180
-Well, let's go, guys.

19
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:40,880
Time to rumble.

20
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:48,280
[theme music]

21
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,325
-I wonder why they're late.

22
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:08,058
-What's keeping them anyway?

23
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:11,091
-They said they'd be
here after practice.

24
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,658
Won't we have to
default in five minutes?

25
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:14,558
What happened to them?

26
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:22,991
-Hey, Higashikata, where do
you think Fudoumine could be?

27
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:24,825
-Looks like there
might be some trouble.

28
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:31,825
-If food fight middle
school doesn't show,

29
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:34,391
we go straight to the finals.

30
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:35,225
Lucky.

31
00:02:35,258 --> 00:02:36,058
-No.

32
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:38,291
Then it's another default.

33
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,958
You're making it sounds
like it's a bad thing.

34
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:43,191
You're supposed
to bring us luck.

35
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:44,858
Right now, I'm not
really sure if that's

36
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:46,858
a good thing or a bad thing.

37
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:48,658
-We're almost there.

38
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:50,091
-What a relief.

39
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:54,025
We should be OK, though, but
you slackers barely made it.

40
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:56,291
A new combo is though.

41
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:59,125
-And that's thanks to you
guys, Akira and Shinji.

42
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:02,258
-We'll definitely
freak out Tachibana.

43
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,058
So, guys, are we going
to split this taxi?

44
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:06,625
-We'll destroy them!

45
00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:08,991
We'll beat Yamabuki
and go to the finals!

46
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:12,058
-At last, We'll get Our
rematch against Seigaku.

47
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,591
SHINJI: It would stink if
we lost that match again.

48
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:20,358
TAICHI: Akutsu!

49
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:21,458
Akutsu, sir!

50
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,491
Huh?

51
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:29,991
I could have sworn
he was just here.

52
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:32,258
Well, I'll just pick
up this trash, then.

53
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:36,191
Goes with being the
manager, I guess.

54
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:37,158
AKUTSU: What's up, Dan?

55
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:43,925
-What?

56
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,158
How can you be so
laid back like that?

57
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:48,825
Where were you?

58
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:49,991
-You talk too much.

59
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,625
Shut your trap, now.

60
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:52,991
-Something's going on.

61
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,791
I don't think Fudoumine's
going to play.

62
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:57,025
It appears they only
have three players who

63
00:03:57,058 --> 00:03:59,025
have made it to the
court so far, Akutsu.

64
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:04,691
Akutsu?

65
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:06,958
Akutsu, where are you going!

66
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:07,525
Akutsu!

67
00:04:07,558 --> 00:04:09,125
Come back here!

68
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:10,491
-Wow.

69
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:13,125
The manager's a first year,
and he's not afraid of Akutsu?

70
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:14,191
-Impossible.

71
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:16,591
You know, to be
perfectly honest,

72
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,791
that nutjob sort of makes
me uncomfortable too.

73
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:22,591
-So why do you think he's
allowed on the team then?

74
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,091
-That's because
he's mighty good.

75
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,391
[phone ringing]

76
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:28,025
NANAKO: Hello?

77
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:29,825
Echizen residence.

78
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:30,491
Uncle.

79
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:32,125
It's Coach Ryuzaki.

80
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:33,925
-What?

81
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,525
Tell her I'm not home.

82
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:36,458
Tell her anything.

83
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:37,791
Just take it.

84
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:39,558
She's waiting.

85
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:40,458
-Ugh.

86
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:42,358
Well, guess I'm stuck.

87
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:44,725
RYUZAKI: It's been a
long time, Nanjiro.

88
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:46,358
Glad to find you at home.

89
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:48,758
Knowing you, I caught
you reading some trash,

90
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,658
huh old pal?

91
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,758
-No way.

92
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,325
You'll never catch me
reading that stuff.

93
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:57,491
So, why did you call me?

94
00:04:57,525 --> 00:05:00,125
I'm sure it wasn't to
discuss literature.

95
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:03,425
-Well, actually, it's
about the opposing team.

96
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,425
Don't let this shock you, OK?

97
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,591
-You'll never shock me.

98
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:11,091
I'll have you know, I have
ice water in my veins.

99
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:11,891
Now, come on.

100
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:13,425
Just give it to me straight.

101
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,591
-Really?

102
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,891
Ready for this?

103
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:19,325
The advisor of the school
we're playing next is Banji.

104
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:19,825
-Banji?

105
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:24,758
Man, I hate that guy!

106
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,591
Just you wait!

107
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,825
I'll let him know who's boss.

108
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:29,158
I'll be right over, pronto.

109
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:31,925
I've been waiting on this
for a long time, Banji!

110
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,825
[beeping]

111
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:34,958
-He never changes.

112
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:39,958
-You're late.

113
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:41,858
Don't scare me like that.

114
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,091
-Don't sweat it.

115
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,191
Stars always arrive late.

116
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:48,291
-We're sorry, Captain Tachibana.

117
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:50,158
We didn't mean to
worry you like that.

118
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:51,825
-Do me a big favor.

119
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,358
Just go and sign in.

120
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:53,858
-Yes.

121
00:06:03,491 --> 00:06:05,191
-Too bad they made it in time.

122
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:07,625
Aw, what a shame.

123
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,058
-The semis are about to start.

124
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:10,491
It's about time.

125
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:16,591
huh?

126
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,458
-What is it?

127
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:21,025
SHIBA: Look at that
Yamabuki player.

128
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:22,991
His eyes look so mean.

129
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:25,191
Then look at the
advisor of theirs.

130
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:26,658
He's all smiles.

131
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:29,425
It's creepy.

132
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,325
Looks like Yamabuki might be
the team to watch out for.

133
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,725
-We can't write them off yet.

134
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:36,158
Mark my words, Shiba.

135
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:38,491
They're definitely gonna
be a tough team to beat.

136
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:42,558
ANNOUNCER: One set match.

137
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,691
Sakurai of Fudoumine will serve.

138
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:54,858
-Hey, how's it going between
Fudoumine and Yamabuki?

139
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:56,525
-They're both strong.

140
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:58,225
-It should be a
really long match.

141
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:11,425
ANNOUNCER: Game and
match to Yamabuki.

142
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,891
Six games to Love.

143
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:17,858
-They're so strong,
Fudoumine was shut out!

144
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:19,591
-Yeah, Yamabuki poured it on.

145
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,158
GIRL (VOICEOVER): Ishida and the
others didn't stand a chance.

146
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,025
Is Yamabuki?

147
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:24,525
Really that good?

148
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:35,125
ANNOUNCER: Singles three, Ibu
of Fudoumine versus Muromachi

149
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:35,758
of Yamabuki.

150
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:55,058
GIRL (VOICEOVER):
Something's strange.

151
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:56,691
It's too one-sided.

152
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,958
It's not that Yamabuki
is too strong.

153
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:01,991
Fudoumine just isn't
pulling it together.

154
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:05,158
-That last match with Ishida
and Sakurai was weird.

155
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:06,625
I wonder what's going on.

156
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:08,325
-Did you hear?

157
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:11,758
Seems that taxi they rode in
had itself a little accident.

158
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,158
-Huh?

159
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:16,825
-Lucky they were all OK.

160
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:17,458
Right guys?

161
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:27,325
-Is that true, Kamio?

162
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,091
Kamio?

163
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:51,725
-What about the match?

164
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:53,758
-Chair judge.

165
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,391
BOY: Fudoumine pulled out while
they were taking a beating.

166
00:08:56,425 --> 00:09:00,091
BOY: They said their taxi was
in an accident on the way here.

167
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:04,225
BOY: Sounds like a
lame excuse to me.

168
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:07,091
-But if it were true, would
you make injured players

169
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,891
go through a match?

170
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,158
Talk about a lousy captain.

171
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:13,625
He sacrificed his players.

172
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:16,125
-Hey, [? kepai. ?]
You've gotta understand,

173
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:19,758
Kamio and the other guys just
didn't want you to worry.

174
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:23,958
-So just tell me, An,
what's your point?

175
00:09:23,991 --> 00:09:25,791
I don't want any
of you to get hurt.

176
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:31,158
We're gonna win.

177
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,091
So we're going straight
to the hospital

178
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,091
to have you guys checked out.

179
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:39,758
-Right, captain.

180
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:46,158
-No way.

181
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:47,891
That's so cheesy.

182
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:50,091
-Hey, it's that guy again.

183
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,925
BOY (VOICEOVER):
Akutsu of Yamabuki.

184
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,125
-That was a smooth
move, the way you guys

185
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:57,391
pulled out of that
big match like that.

186
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:58,358
Well, well.

187
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:00,458
There goes your reputation.

188
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:01,725
Isn't that right, captain?

189
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:10,058
You know, they say if
you can't take the heat,

190
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:11,791
don't enter the match.

191
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:13,125
Right, chump?

192
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:15,491
-Just let me at that jerk.

193
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:16,758
Hey, cool it.

194
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,925
-So, then, you wanna fight?

195
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,858
'Cause, you know, tennis is
a little too tame for me.

196
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:24,958
-Argh!

197
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,491
-Don't even think
about it, Kamio.

198
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,825
You're falling
directly into his trap.

199
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:33,958
If you wanna play the Kanto
team, don't mess it up.

200
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:34,858
Let's go, guys.

201
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:39,391
AKUTSU (VOICEOER): You're pretty
sharp for a loser, Tachibana.

202
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,658
-Well, I'm sorry Tezuka.

203
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:53,725
Looks like our showdown
will have to wait.

204
00:10:56,991 --> 00:11:00,658
[clapping]

205
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:02,458
-Nice to see you, Team Seigaku.

206
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:11,925
-Moron.

207
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,591
-Doesn't he just make
you wanna throw up?

208
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,591
-No doubt?

209
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:33,608
-Ah, here it is.

210
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,608
-Um, sir, I'm sorry,
but you're not

211
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:38,842
allowed to bring
your bike in here.

212
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,142
-Don't worry, I'm with the PTA.

213
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:41,975
-Huh?

214
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:43,708
The PTA?

215
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:44,742
-Thanks, see you later.

216
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:45,942
-Hey, you, wait!

217
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:57,742
-Are you waiting for
someone, Coach Ryuzaki?

218
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:59,175
-Huh?

219
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:03,275
Well, my, my, Mr.
Banda of Yamabuki.

220
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:07,108
-So, are you still the
tennis coach at Seigaku?

221
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:09,508
-You know the answer to that.

222
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:12,908
-I see that you have some
really good players this year.

223
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:15,675
So do you.

224
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:19,742
-I just want tennis to be fun
for these fine young players.

225
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:22,175
I hope you'll go
easy on my boys.

226
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,142
And I could ask the same
thing of your players.

227
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:27,742
[chuckling]

228
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,075
-There he is.

229
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:32,442
That old geezer's
still a slime bag.

230
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:34,275
I'll show him who's boss.

231
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:36,775
I'll never forget
that jerk did to me.

232
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:37,508
-Hey, you.

233
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:39,075
You.

234
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:41,108
So, what do you think
you're doing there, huh?

235
00:12:44,908 --> 00:12:45,908
Hey, wait!

236
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:46,475
You.

237
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:46,975
Wait.

238
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:48,042
Stop!

239
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:49,808
Hey, stop, come on!

240
00:12:49,842 --> 00:12:53,108
-Aw, [? fine in ?] the PTA.

241
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:56,908
-The time has finally come
to beat Seigaku and become

242
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,075
the league champs.

243
00:12:58,108 --> 00:12:59,208
-Yeah!

244
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:01,075
-The match with that kid
was such a nightmare.

245
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:16,542
-Don't even think of
that as a nightmare.

246
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:18,908
Use that memory to psych
yourselves up for the challenge

247
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:21,142
we're facing now.

248
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,842
That kid was no ordinary player.

249
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,208
-He'll probably turn
pro before too long.

250
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:29,342
-Playing against him has
made us even stronger.

251
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,875
-Hey guys, here comes Seigaku.

252
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,342
-That's Kunimitsu Tezuka.

253
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,942
Captain of the Seigaku team.

254
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:48,908
He's good enough to play in the
high school league no problem.

255
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,875
-We can never beat Tezuka.

256
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:55,608
He's too good.

257
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:57,108
Impossible.

258
00:13:57,142 --> 00:14:00,742
He's just on a completely
different level.

259
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:01,542
-Well then.

260
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,542
We'll beat the rest of them.

261
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:03,808
-They're tough.

262
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:07,508
-The next tier is Shuichiro
Oishi and Eiji Kikumaru.

263
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,075
They're known as
Seigaku's golden pair.

264
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:14,075
Oishi's calm and shrewd, and
Kikumaru's agile and nimble.

265
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:16,808
They reached the
nationals last year.

266
00:14:16,842 --> 00:14:17,742
-What?

267
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,675
They made the nationals?

268
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,508
-OK then.

269
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:22,308
Forget about those two matches.

270
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:25,342
We still have a chance to win
with the three that are left.

271
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,675
-No way.

272
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,408
Look who's here.

273
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:29,475
Kaoru Kaidoh.

274
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:31,908
He loves to wear out
his opponent slowly.

275
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:35,342
He'll beat you up with his snake
shot and finish you quickly.

276
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:38,742
-Aw, man.

277
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:39,975
That really stinks.

278
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:40,808
-Wait.

279
00:14:40,842 --> 00:14:42,075
There's still more of them.

280
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:44,642
Takeshi Momoshiro's a
second year like Kaidoh.

281
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,842
In a match against St.
Rudolph, his super dunk smash

282
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,208
whacked his opponent
in the face.

283
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:56,742
-So, tell me, how do we win?

284
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,075
-And why are we hiding?

285
00:14:58,108 --> 00:14:58,708
-Quiet.

286
00:14:58,742 --> 00:15:00,875
There's much more.

287
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:03,842
Takashi Kawamura looks meek,
but when he holds his racket,

288
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,708
he gets scary.

289
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:09,075
His burning serves have
broken 200 kilos per hour,

290
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,208
and a whole lot of rackets.

291
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:12,375
There's more.

292
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:14,742
They've also got that
guy Shusuke Fuji.

293
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:17,208
He's the team's number
two genius player.

294
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:19,742
He's been known to completely
destroy his competition

295
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:20,775
with his triple counters.

296
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:30,708
-Then who in the world is
left that we can beat, huh?

297
00:15:30,742 --> 00:15:32,375
-There's still one more.

298
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:33,508
-Huh?

299
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,975
-Seigaku's got a first
year player on the team.

300
00:15:36,008 --> 00:15:37,608
We'll beat him.

301
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:38,608
-First year?

302
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:40,042
I can beat him for sure.

303
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:41,408
Let me play that match.

304
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,242
-No way.

305
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,842
I'll pulverize the twerp.

306
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,142
-Nope.

307
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:47,508
I'm the one already slated
to play against him, Domoto.

308
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:49,542
-Here comes the kid now.

309
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,008
-Where is he, anyway?

310
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:02,575
-Huh?

311
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:03,742
-Is this for real?

312
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:05,308
-Y--Yeah, I think so.

313
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:06,808
-You're joking.

314
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,008
-Hey there, guys.

315
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:10,108
So, you ready to lose again?

316
00:16:10,142 --> 00:16:12,208
Or do you just want
your balls back?

317
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:13,842
Well, you can't have them.

318
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:18,608
-Aw.

319
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,775
ANNOUNCER: The second match
of the semifinals will begin.

320
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:29,308
Seigaku versus Ginka.

321
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,242
-Hey!

322
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:39,642
It's Ryoma!

323
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:41,608
-Play hard, Ryoma!

324
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:43,575
-We're in the semifinals.

325
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,542
-I can't believe I'm so nervous.

326
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:48,042
-I wonder how strong
this Ginka team is?

327
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:49,808
-We cannot take them lightly.

328
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,942
They are in the semifinals.

329
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,675
-Well, men.

330
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,542
Let's do this thing!

331
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:02,042
-Ginka looks confident.

332
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:05,275
We can't let our guard
down against them.

333
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:06,375
-We've got stomach aches.

334
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:08,342
We default!

335
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:08,842
-Huh?

336
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:09,775
-Huh?

337
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:11,608
-Huh?

338
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:14,442
ANNOUNCER: Due to unforeseen
illness, Ginka concedes.

339
00:17:14,475 --> 00:17:15,408
-Yeah!

340
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:16,875
We won!

341
00:17:16,908 --> 00:17:18,375
It looks like we
scared them off!

342
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:21,542
I don't quite know how.

343
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:24,042
But our boys are definitely
going to the finals.

344
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:28,742
-What's up, losers?

345
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:29,842
-Huh?

346
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,975
-Why'd you let that
punk team off so easy?

347
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:33,642
-Hear that?

348
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:34,908
He called us punks.

349
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:36,808
-Seigaku's not much.

350
00:17:36,842 --> 00:17:39,108
You just got lucky.

351
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,508
-Uh, we'd better go, guys.

352
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,675
-He's got a big mouth.

353
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,675
[hiss]

354
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,675
-I'll show him, that jerk.

355
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,675
-Momo, stop right now.

356
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,075
-Come on, Momo.

357
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:54,708
You wanna fight?

358
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:56,408
Let's do this.

359
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,208
-Oh yeah?

360
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,375
I'm gonna show that guy.

361
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:04,775
BOY: Stop it, Momo.

362
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:12,042
I've seen enough.

363
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:18,475
-Whew.

364
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:20,675
I was scared there for a minute.

365
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,508
-That's good.

366
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:23,142
The captain stopped them cold.

367
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:24,542
-Who is that?

368
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:26,842
That guy's acting
just plain nuts.

369
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,442
-Scary.

370
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:29,742
INUI: He is Akutsu of Yamabuki.

371
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,875
-Yamabuki Junior High?

372
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:34,342
INUI: Yes, our next opponent.

373
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,842
Yamabuki has some of the
best doubles teams around.

374
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,408
Last year, two made
it to nationals.

375
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:41,608
-Whoa.

376
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:43,675
-They are counting on
the doubles teams to win.

377
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:47,108
They rely on Sengoku
to win his singles.

378
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:48,808
That is their best strategy.

379
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:49,908
-But wait.

380
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:51,608
Do you really think that
they can play better

381
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:52,975
than our golden pair?

382
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:56,208
-Last year, Oishi and his old
partner lost to these guys.

383
00:18:56,242 --> 00:18:58,775
The same duo who's
playing here today.

384
00:18:58,808 --> 00:18:59,742
-But wait.

385
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:02,275
Didn't we beat
Yamabuki last year?

386
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:02,908
-Yes.

387
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,542
We certainly did.

388
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,375
We lost both doubles,
but Tezuka played

389
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:10,208
great in that match
and beat Sengoku.

390
00:19:10,242 --> 00:19:12,275
-You know, if they had
another top notch singles

391
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:15,542
player on their team, we
might have lost against them.

392
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:19,275
-But this year, they have one.

393
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:22,608
-You don't mean him?

394
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:26,075
-I'm afraid so.

395
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:29,408
ANNOUNCER: The Metropolitan
Semifinals will begin shortly.

396
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:31,375
Yamabuki versus Seigaku.

397
00:19:31,408 --> 00:19:34,042
[cheering]

398
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:35,508
-The match is about to begin.

399
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:39,542
-Who do you think'll win
it, Seigaku or Yamabuki?

400
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:42,808
Seigaku or Yamabuki?

401
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:44,208
Seigaku or Yamabuki?

402
00:19:47,508 --> 00:19:49,675
ANNOUNCER: Game and
match to Yamabuki.

403
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,842
Six games to three.

404
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,175
HORIO: This is crazy.

405
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,742
Seigaku doubles lost.

406
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,408
KACHIRO: They lost?

407
00:19:58,442 --> 00:19:59,775
KATSUO: Impossible.

408
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:02,008
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER): They
had such a good chance.

409
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,975
So, even those two
couldn't win at doubles.

410
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:07,142
They're all good
individual players,

411
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:09,908
but they don't play as a team.

412
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,175
That's our weak point.

413
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,408
Apart from Oishi and
Kikumaru, we just

414
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:17,642
don't have strong
doubles players.

415
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:28,036
[theme music]

416
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:59,036
-I'm Minami from
Yamabuki junior high.

417
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:00,203
-And I'm Higashi Kata.

418
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:02,269
TOGETHER: Together we're
called Plain and Simple.

419
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,803
-I don't think I like that name.

420
00:21:03,836 --> 00:21:04,869
-Me, either.

421
00:21:04,903 --> 00:21:06,903
Oishi's been calling
us Plain and Simple.

422
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:07,869
Plain and simple?

423
00:21:07,903 --> 00:21:09,069
-Oishi didn't call us that.

424
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:11,136
Our own teammate Sengoku's
been calling us that.

425
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,203
-Better watch Sengoku.

426
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:14,369
We're gonna have a
major victory this year.

427
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:15,136
Oops.

428
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:16,136
There's a hole in my sock.

429
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:17,569
-That's so lame and simple.

430
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:18,803
-Hey, what'd you just say?

431
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:21,103
Next, on "The Prince of
Tennis," Oishi is Targeted.

432
00:21:21,136 --> 00:21:24,336
Hey, I see a standing tea
stalk floating in my tea.

433
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:27,869
That's good luck.
