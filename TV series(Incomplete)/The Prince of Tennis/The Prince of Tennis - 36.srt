1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,910
-We are starting.

2
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:14,043
Number two singles, Fuji
of Seigaku versus Mizuki

3
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:15,143
of St. Rudolph.

4
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:43,043
[theme music]

5
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:53,496
-Fuji doesn't seem like himself.

6
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,376
-Uh, he looks different
than usual and much scarier.

7
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,542
-What do you think could
be wrong with Fuji?

8
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:01,009
-I don't know.

9
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:09,642
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER): My, my,
you have an angry expression.

10
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:11,542
-Well, then, let's
have a great match.

11
00:02:14,742 --> 00:02:16,776
JUDGE: One set match,
Fuji of Seigaku to serve.

12
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:45,076
BOY IN CROWD: Wow,
Mizuki is great.

13
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:48,776
He's going to win this match.

14
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:49,876
-Why are they so surprised?

15
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:03,076
-He got a return ace.

16
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:04,176
-Fuji couldn't move at all.

17
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,142
Like he was rooted
to that one spot.

18
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:08,376
-This Mazuki is very good.

19
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:11,442
-I don't suppose he's likely
to lose a big match like this,

20
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:12,409
right?

21
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,009
-That's not in
Mizuki's game plan.

22
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:17,542
In a case like this,
the data does not lie.

23
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:21,942
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Shusuke Fuji,

24
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:31,976
you're a really strong
player but you can't beat me

25
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:36,209
because not only
have I researched

26
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:39,909
my opponent thoroughly, and
know what to expect from him,

27
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:42,842
I've also practiced my
game plan in advance.

28
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:47,642
Based on my data, I can
see everything, Fuji.

29
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:49,576
All of your weaknesses.

30
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:55,842
-Fuji's in trouble.

31
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:57,309
-This is not good.

32
00:03:57,342 --> 00:03:59,542
Mizuki's done his
research all too well.

33
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:02,309
-Yeah, I have a bad
feeling about this.

34
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,242
-Don't worry about it.

35
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,009
Come on, Fuji, you can do it.

36
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:32,909
-So you're leaving already?

37
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:33,409
-Yeah.

38
00:05:05,109 --> 00:05:06,209
JUDGE: Game.

39
00:05:06,242 --> 00:05:09,409
Mizuki of St. Rudolph
leads one game to love.

40
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,276
-Oh no, he lost his
service game already.

41
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:15,842
-Don't worry, this
match has just started.

42
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:17,876
BOY IN CROWD 1: I've never
seen anything like it.

43
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:20,776
BOY IN CROWD 2: Hey, I heard
Fuji of Seigaku is struggling.

44
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:22,342
BOY IN CROWD 1: No way.

45
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:25,342
Anyway, let's go watch.

46
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:27,376
-And who's Seigaku's opponent?

47
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:28,676
-I heard it's St. Rudolph.

48
00:05:32,109 --> 00:05:33,509
-Game.

49
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,676
Mizuki of St. Rudolph.

50
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,309
Five games to love.

51
00:05:36,342 --> 00:05:39,042
Change courts.

52
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:40,976
BOY IN CROWD 1:
Way to go, Mizuki.

53
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,142
He'll win this match easy.

54
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:09,276
[crowd chanting]

55
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:19,409
-You'll never
surpass your brother.

56
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,542
-Hm?

57
00:06:27,576 --> 00:06:29,776
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER): Why
is everyone so excited?

58
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:31,142
This was the expected outcome.

59
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,409
Everybody played
exactly as I predicted.

60
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:43,109
-Mizuki, I just want to make
sure you knew that the twist

61
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:45,642
spin shout puts a
strain on the body,

62
00:06:45,676 --> 00:06:49,842
and you still
taught it to Yuuta.

63
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,709
-Winning is what's important.

64
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:54,342
And in case you and your brother
didn't know it, winning always

65
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:55,309
comes with a price.

66
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:17,642
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Switching rackets now

67
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:20,142
will make no difference.

68
00:07:20,176 --> 00:07:23,576
Isn't it pathetic,
Shusuke Fuji, I already

69
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,009
know you use another racket
with a different tension

70
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:30,676
to make minor changes
in power or spin.

71
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:34,109
Too bad though, the tension
of the strings on that racket

72
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:36,076
is 58 pounds.

73
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:37,442
I already researched it.

74
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,342
You disappoint me.

75
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:42,509
I thought you were a genius.

76
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:01,442
-Have you been
collecting any good data?

77
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:03,876
-Yes, I have Inui.

78
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:06,909
-I wonder if he was successful
in getting accurate data?

79
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:08,176
-Of course, he did.

80
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:09,509
What are you thinking, Inui?

81
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,609
-That's why Fuji's way
behind right now, 0-5.

82
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:17,976
-Even I've never managed
to be able to collect

83
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:21,942
accurate data on Fuji.

84
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:23,942
-Hey, what's going on?

85
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:05,109
-Useless, you can't
return this, Fuji.

86
00:09:05,142 --> 00:09:06,576
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Well, this is it.

87
00:09:27,742 --> 00:09:30,842
-No way, that shot was supposed
to have been impossible

88
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:34,042
for him to hit back?

89
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:37,176
-Actually, that was
my favorite spot

90
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,376
on the court to hit the ball.

91
00:09:49,376 --> 00:09:51,542
-Why, he's nothing
but a show off.

92
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:52,342
-Yeah.

93
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:54,042
-All right, Fuji, way to go.

94
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:56,009
-Yeah, time to counterattack.

95
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,042
-Right, pick 'em apart
then break 'em down.

96
00:09:58,076 --> 00:09:59,042
-What?

97
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:00,509
Are we finally
agreeing on something?

98
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:03,209
-Shut your mouth.

99
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:05,209
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER): No, no way.

100
00:10:05,242 --> 00:10:06,709
This can't be happening.

101
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,176
OK, now let's try this spot.

102
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,026
That one didn't work so well.

103
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:22,426
Not this one either.

104
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:24,359
Here?

105
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:26,259
What?

106
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,326
But all of these shots were
supposed to hit his weak spot.

107
00:10:32,992 --> 00:10:35,592
-Weak shots?

108
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:38,559
Those are all my favorite shots.

109
00:10:38,592 --> 00:10:40,526
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
This can't be happening.

110
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,159
My research is never wrong.

111
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:50,492
All my data is wrong then.

112
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,892
-Fuji is not in the
habit of letting

113
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,126
others know his weaknesses.

114
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,659
Mizuki only thought he
knew what they were.

115
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:06,792
-Great play, Fuji.

116
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:07,292
-Yeah.

117
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:08,759
Go for it.

118
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,259
-Wowie, Fuji is
the super coolest.

119
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:13,726
-Easy Tomo.

120
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,192
-I can see why everybody
calls him a genius.

121
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:20,226
Now that Mizuki's data has
turned out to be inaccurate,

122
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,992
it appears he has no chance.

123
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:23,392
Isn't that right, Inui?

124
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:25,759
-I agree, and I know
how tough it is.

125
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,359
JUDGE: Game and match.

126
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,926
Fuji Shusuke, seven
games to five.

127
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:47,559
-Hyotei.

128
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:52,426
-That's Shusake Fuji for you,
he's playing perfect tennis.

129
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:54,626
You better remember him Kabaji.

130
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:55,592
-OK.

131
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,726
-Man, that guy is such a loser.

132
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,226
-Ahh!

133
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,126
You.

134
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,526
You did it on purpose, you
may it love 5 deliberately.

135
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:16,692
You sneaky little--

136
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:20,059
-Thanks for taking care
of my little brother.

137
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:29,592
-Big brother.

138
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:34,359
-That was a good match in many
ways, wouldn't you say so?

139
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:35,392
-Yes.

140
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:37,226
-Yah, what a comeback.

141
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:40,426
Gotta be the greatest
I've ever seen.

142
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,592
-Amazing.

143
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,359
He didn't give up another
point once he got in gear.

144
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:46,826
-Fuji, he's one cool customer.

145
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,359
-Shoot.

146
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:56,859
I had to win the match.

147
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:58,326
There's no point if I can't win.

148
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:00,159
-Mizuki, there's
still a chance to play

149
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:01,559
a match for fifth place.

150
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:03,492
-I shouldn't have
lost at this stage.

151
00:13:03,526 --> 00:13:05,359
Even one loss is unacceptable.

152
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:08,259
It leaves a stain on
St. Rudolph's record.

153
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:11,659
-Tachibana, can you believe
they're crying over that match?

154
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:15,226
-It's Fudomine.

155
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:19,226
-They'll never understand
how I feel about this.

156
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:20,959
-If you want my
advice, he should

157
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:23,926
start rebuilding a whole
new St. Rudolph tennis

158
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,192
team for next year.

159
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:27,126
-High and mighty talk.

160
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,292
-That's how we did it.

161
00:13:29,326 --> 00:13:29,992
Let's go.

162
00:13:36,726 --> 00:13:37,892
-Something wrong, Captain?

163
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:38,659
-Forget it.

164
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,559
It's not important.

165
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:42,526
JUDGE: Seigaku
beats St. Rudolph.

166
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,526
The result is three to one.

167
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,326
ALL: Thank you.

168
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:50,226
JUDGE: Game and match, Fudomine.

169
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:52,492
The score is six games four.

170
00:13:52,526 --> 00:13:56,692
Eiji and Syuichiroh pair.

171
00:13:56,726 --> 00:13:58,392
Game and match, Fudomine.

172
00:13:58,426 --> 00:14:00,592
The score is six games to one.

173
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:02,459
Ibu and Kamio pair.

174
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:07,926
-Hyotei has lost two
doubles matches in a row.

175
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:09,259
That was unexpected.

176
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:10,392
-It's always better to win.

177
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:12,392
It looks like Fudomine
is dominating.

178
00:14:12,426 --> 00:14:14,959
-My thoughts exactly.

179
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:15,526
-Hello.

180
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,426
-Do not mind me.

181
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:17,626
I'm not here to interrupt.

182
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:20,559
I'm just here collecting data.

183
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:23,192
-Hey, looks like Tachibana
is going to be playing next.

184
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:25,292
-So you're the captain, huh?

185
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:27,126
I'm surprised you're
playing this early.

186
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,992
Well, it doesn't
matter who my opponent

187
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:30,292
is, I'll win in 20 minutes.

188
00:14:40,392 --> 00:14:43,026
-And how's your arm doing?

189
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:44,559
-It's feeling all right now.

190
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,859
-I see.

191
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:47,659
-Did you want to talk to me?

192
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:50,959
-Do you enjoy playing tennis?

193
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:52,426
-Well, I think so.

194
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,059
-That's very
important, especially

195
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:57,726
if you want to keep playing
and getting better and better.

196
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,459
-Yeah, I do.

197
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:02,626
-Keep advancing to
the Kanto Tournament.

198
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:07,126
My boys are looking forward
to seeing you there too.

199
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:07,626
-OK.

200
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,226
-Yuuta.

201
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:14,726
Yuuta.

202
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,459
Yuuta.

203
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:21,692
-Hey, you, I think you've had
enough fun now, haven't you?

204
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:23,559
I'm going to be
moving in now, OK?

205
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:30,192
JUDGE: Game.

206
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:32,459
Fudomine leads one game to love.

207
00:15:32,492 --> 00:15:34,059
-Where did Fudomine come from?

208
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:37,492
CROWD: That guy's great.

209
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:39,592
-Looks like he's in a
whole mess of trouble.

210
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:40,992
-What?

211
00:15:41,026 --> 00:15:43,092
-I'm pretty sure I remember that
guy in the video of last year's

212
00:15:43,126 --> 00:15:44,459
Nationals.

213
00:15:44,492 --> 00:15:47,726
I didn't recognize him before
because he used to be blond.

214
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,259
He was one of the two best
players in the queue shoot

215
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:54,259
district, the ace of Shishigaku
Junior High, Tachibana.

216
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:55,692
JUDGE: Game and match.

217
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:59,126
Fudomine, six games to love.

218
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,059
-Sorry about that.

219
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,192
I won in 15 minutes.

220
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:09,426
-I didn't know he was in
the Metropolitan Tournament.

221
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:10,592
-Just as I thought.

222
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:12,626
There he is.

223
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:13,959
Tachibana.

224
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:16,126
He's a nationally ranked player.

225
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,959
ATOBE (VOICEOVER): I
didn't pay any attention

226
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:20,092
because it's an unknown school.

227
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:21,659
You took advantage of it.

228
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:24,359
You made a line up that took
the first three matches.

229
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:25,959
You've got us Tachibana.

230
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:27,326
JUDGE: Fudomine wins.

231
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:30,959
The result is three to love.

232
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:34,359
Chiobyashi and Ogawa lost
your doubles match four games

233
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:35,759
to six.

234
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:39,492
Kita and Kashuya also lost their
doubles match one game to six.

235
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:41,259
Even though Shishido
is a regular,

236
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,859
he was thrashed love to six.

237
00:16:43,892 --> 00:16:48,359
Well, we didn't expect we'd
lose in the quarter finals.

238
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:50,992
Yes, I'll remove Shishido
from the regulars.

239
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:56,659
And please tell Jiro to
come by next week, OK?

240
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:59,526
Yeah, thanks.

241
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,526
-The first day of the
tournament is over.

242
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,759
The schools that will
advance to the semifinals

243
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:07,792
are Fudomine, Yamabuki,
Ginka, and Seigaku.

244
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,259
Those four schools
are eligible to play

245
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:11,859
at the Kanto tournament.

246
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:14,159
[cheering]

247
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:17,359
-In addition, the semifinals,
finals, and consolation

248
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:18,859
matches will be held next week.

249
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:20,126
That is all.

250
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:21,492
Thank you for your
participation.

251
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:22,959
ALL: Thank you very much.

252
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:37,392
-Mizuki, thank you very much for
everything you've done for me.

253
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:39,726
-Yuuta, it sounds like you're
planning on leaving us.

254
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,459
I hope that's not the case.

255
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:42,892
-No, but I owe
everything to Mizuki

256
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:47,026
for bringing me this far,
and for that, I'm grateful.

257
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,426
I've learned to
concentrate on winning

258
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,859
is not such a terrible
thing after all.

259
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:58,792
But from now on, I've got
to try to do it all myself.

260
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:01,692
Is that OK, Mizuki?

261
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:03,626
-I see and I understand.

262
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:05,592
Thank you very much.

263
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,926
You can bet I will win
my consolation match.

264
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:20,726
-Hey, Yuuta, good luck in
your consolation match.

265
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:22,392
-Oh, shut up.

266
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:24,759
-If St. Rudolph advances
to the Kanto tournament,

267
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,859
I hope we'll play each other.

268
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:28,559
-I don't want to
play against you.

269
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:31,192
I prefer challenging
Tezuka instead.

270
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,626
-By the way, Yuuta, you're
going to stop by the house

271
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:34,526
today, right?

272
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,859
-No.

273
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:38,726
Mom made that curry with pumpkin
and she's waiting for you.

274
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:39,826
-What?

275
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:41,826
-Oh, yeah, and sis was baking.

276
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,292
A raspberry pie.

277
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:46,126
-Really?

278
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,826
-I lost.

279
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:50,159
The number one doubles match.

280
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:53,092
I should have hit that shot
in the other direction.

281
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:55,092
I should have done
something different earlier.

282
00:18:58,726 --> 00:18:59,192
Ahhh.

283
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:11,592
OK, self-criticism is over.

284
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:13,192
-I knew you were
going to be here.

285
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:13,892
-Huh?

286
00:19:13,926 --> 00:19:16,692
Oishi, I'm all done now.

287
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:21,992
Ever since we started
playing doubles together,

288
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:23,492
we've had meetings here.

289
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:26,992
And every time we lost a match.

290
00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:30,459
How many times
have we come here?

291
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:32,259
-I don't remember.

292
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:37,326
-Oishi, this'll be the last
time that we come here.

293
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,959
We'll keep getting
better, and we'll go to--

294
00:19:39,992 --> 00:19:42,226
-Go to-- where?

295
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:44,926
-The Metropolitans, of course,
then the Kanto tournament,

296
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:50,226
and after that, we'll become
number one at the Nationals.

297
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:53,526
-Hey, where are
Kikumarua and Oishi?

298
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,859
-Now, don't start worrying.

299
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:58,059
Those two are just hanging
out somewhere on the way.

300
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:13,426
-Look, Momo's drooling
all over his shirt.

301
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,292
-Hey, and Kaidoh
is doing it too.

302
00:20:16,326 --> 00:20:19,559
-Talking about Momo like
that is OK, but not Kaidoh.

303
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:25,759
-Wowie.

304
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,692
Ryoma's so cute
when he's asleep.

305
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,592
-Be quiet or he's
going to wake up.

306
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:32,526
-But he's just the
cutest thing on earth.

307
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,392
ANNOUNCER: Next stop, Sashundie.

308
00:20:37,426 --> 00:20:40,092
-Kawamura, push the
bell for that one.

309
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:40,592
-OK.

310
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:45,359
Momo, Kaidoh, Echizen, hey.

311
00:20:45,392 --> 00:20:47,326
We have to get off the bus.

312
00:21:34,261 --> 00:21:38,761
[theme music]

313
00:22:06,127 --> 00:22:09,094
-Hello, this is Sakuno Ryuzaki.

314
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:13,061
Ryoma is going to be a tennis
coach for Tomoka and me.

315
00:22:13,094 --> 00:22:16,327
But the ball I hit landed in
another school's tennis court.

316
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:20,527
Well, I'm sure I can find
it because that ball had

317
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:22,261
Ryoma's face drawn on it.

318
00:22:22,294 --> 00:22:27,327
Next on the "Prince of Tennis, A
Tennis Ball with Ryoma's Face."

319
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:28,527
What?

320
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:31,861
You're going to get it
back for me, Ryoma, right?
