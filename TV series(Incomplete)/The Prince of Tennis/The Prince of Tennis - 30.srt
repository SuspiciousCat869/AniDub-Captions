1
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:14,240
-All right.

2
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:15,240
Guess what's coming.

3
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:16,393
-Snake shot.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,986
ALL: Kaidoh, no!

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,486
[laugh]

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,486
[laugh]

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:26,986
[laugh]

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,953
-Huh?

9
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:32,453
[theme music]

10
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,656
-Huh?

11
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,923
[grunt]

12
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,656
ANNOUNCER: 15-love.

13
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,456
BOTH: Huh?

14
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,856
-Ugh.

15
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,423
-Aw.

16
00:01:59,456 --> 00:02:00,746
He missed it.

17
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:07,946
-Kaidoh, why didn't you
use your snake shot?

18
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,046
-Shut up.

19
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:11,079
What about your
dropped shot, Momo?

20
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:12,746
Your right foot should be out.

21
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:14,813
You still haven't really
fixed it, have you?

22
00:02:14,846 --> 00:02:18,046
-He didn't use his
snake shot, sure enough.

23
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,879
-Those guys have us
scouted real good.

24
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:22,313
They seem to know all our
strengths and weaknesses.

25
00:02:22,346 --> 00:02:23,146
-Hmm.

26
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:24,513
Well, that's all right by me.

27
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:29,879
-Hmm.

28
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:31,746
-Looks like they were
waiting for Kaidoh

29
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:33,379
to use his snake shot.

30
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:34,679
-Looks like it.

31
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:36,913
This match might be a
little tough for them.

32
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,146
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER): Scouted us?

33
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:44,646
Big deal.

34
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:47,613
[grunts]

35
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:49,613
[laugh]

36
00:02:49,646 --> 00:02:51,379
-That's mine, sure enough.

37
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:56,779
[grunt]

38
00:02:56,813 --> 00:03:00,179
[laugh]

39
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,779
[grunt]

40
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:03,946
-What's the matter with you?

41
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:06,246
Are you afraid to
show me your snake?

42
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:09,113
-Shut up.

43
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:10,079
[grunt]

44
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:13,013
-He's scared, sure enough.

45
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:14,479
[grunt]

46
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:16,179
-Oh, this is a bad.

47
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:18,479
Kaidoh's snake shot has
been totally shut down.

48
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:19,546
-Yeah.

49
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,746
It looks like they
have their hands full

50
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:22,346
just returning every ball.

51
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:25,446
-It looks like they're really
feeling the pressure right now.

52
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:29,113
This really is not
going well at all.

53
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:29,946
-Try this one.

54
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:32,379
[grunt]

55
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,913
-Kaidoh, follow the ball.

56
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:35,879
-Don't order me around.

57
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:39,579
[grunt]

58
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:40,179
-Atsushi!

59
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:41,079
-Leave it to me.

60
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,913
[evil laugh]

61
00:03:45,946 --> 00:03:47,846
[grunt]

62
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,813
-You guys are
stubborn, sure enough.

63
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:54,613
[grunt]

64
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:55,746
ALL: Cord ball, yes.

65
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:59,579
And it's over the net!

66
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:00,346
-There.

67
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:01,413
You see how good they are?

68
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:03,346
They're quick enough
to rush to the net.

69
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:05,913
-Sakuno, what exactly
does cord ball mean?

70
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,479
-It's a ball that clips the net
and lands in the other court.

71
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:10,979
But because it's uncertain
where, it's hard to get.

72
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:12,646
However, those two
are quite used to it

73
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,579
in tournament matches.

74
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,446
-Man, how long is this
round gonna continue?

75
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,346
-Ugh, it's so hot out.

76
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,179
[laughs]

77
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:32,979
-Shoot.

78
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:35,179
If not for Kaidoh, we would've
won this stupid match already.

79
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:37,146
[gasps]

80
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:39,046
-That's what I was
getting ready to tell you.

81
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,446
[grunt]

82
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:42,479
[sigh]

83
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:45,013
-Is this is a match or a fight?

84
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:52,779
-It's already been
over 40 minutes.

85
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:53,846
-Yeah.

86
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:57,313
They gotta be on the
verge of exhaustion.

87
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:58,913
And then there's this heat.

88
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,146
-Change courts.

89
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:18,246
[sigh]

90
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,679
-And how are you boys
holding up so far?

91
00:05:20,713 --> 00:05:22,446
-Well, I gotta
tell you, those two

92
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,779
are really quite competitive.

93
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:25,079
But I'm having fun.

94
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:26,146
-I'll bet.

95
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:27,646
Looks like you're
breathing hard enough.

96
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,046
-You looking for a fight?

97
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,579
-Now come on, you two.

98
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:33,946
It's hot enough out here already
without all this senseless

99
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:34,779
bickering.

100
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,779
-Hey, I'm the one being cool.

101
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:37,446
-Yeah.

102
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:38,513
I wonder about that.

103
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,579
-What'd you say?

104
00:05:39,613 --> 00:05:40,846
-Stop it this instant.

105
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,946
You both seem to have
lots of energy left.

106
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:45,146
Now, how about applying
it to the match?

107
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:45,646
-Yeah.

108
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,613
Haha.

109
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,946
I guess you're right about that.

110
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:49,879
Come to think of it,
I'm not that tired.

111
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:50,946
-Hmm.

112
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:52,046
-Whatever.

113
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,746
But when it comes to
technique and team play,

114
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:55,479
they've got you beat hands down.

115
00:05:55,513 --> 00:05:57,779
Now, what do you
intend to do about it?

116
00:05:57,813 --> 00:05:58,813
-We have stamina.

117
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:00,179
-And we have spirit.

118
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:03,046
BOTH: So we will win.

119
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,346
All right.

120
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,713
[sigh]

121
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:10,013
-Hmm.

122
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:13,179
If you keep up your pace,
you're gonna win this match.

123
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:16,279
You memorized the data
on those two, right?

124
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:18,346
Statistics, probabilities?

125
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:18,913
-Sure enough.

126
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,479
-Sure did.

127
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,679
-It's hopeless.

128
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:23,546
They're getting on each
other's nerves so bad,

129
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:26,079
and they're not even
playing at all in sync.

130
00:06:26,113 --> 00:06:28,246
At this rate they'll end
up dragging each other down

131
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,113
to defeat.

132
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:31,313
-What can we do?

133
00:06:31,346 --> 00:06:33,946
-Yo.

134
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:36,679
Our genius of a manager told
is all about the two of you.

135
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:39,313
He even simulated your
data and analyzed it.

136
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:40,879
And his conclusion
was that we are

137
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:43,513
supposed to win this match 6-2.

138
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:44,613
Sure enough.

139
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:47,079
Sure enough, he's been
right on the money.

140
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:49,079
You've only won two games.

141
00:06:49,113 --> 00:06:50,946
Mizuki's scenarios
can be frightening

142
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,179
no matter whom we play.

143
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,746
The match goes exactly
as he analyzed it.

144
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:56,879
We know what the result
will be without playing

145
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:58,446
any further, sure enough.

146
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,146
Haha.

147
00:06:59,179 --> 00:06:59,979
BOTH: Shut your mouth.

148
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:01,279
You talk too much, sure enough.

149
00:07:01,313 --> 00:07:02,646
-Huh?

150
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:03,346
ALL: Wow.

151
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:06,813
They're in perfect sync.

152
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:09,779
-Hey, Rudolph, listen closely
to me and learn something.

153
00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:13,213
There's no such thing
as a scenario in tennis.

154
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:14,479
We'll prove it to you.

155
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:28,479
-OK.

156
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:29,546
Now let's go do this.

157
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:30,346
Concentrate.

158
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:30,979
-Shut up.

159
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:32,013
I know what to do.

160
00:07:32,046 --> 00:07:33,413
Don't order me around.

161
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:34,713
-I'm not giving orders.

162
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,513
I'm just pumping myself up.

163
00:07:37,546 --> 00:07:38,179
ANNOUNCER: Time!

164
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:39,979
-Huh?

165
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:40,546
-OK.

166
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:41,379
But do it fast.

167
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:42,013
-I understand.

168
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:51,546
-I wonder what he's
doing that for.

169
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:52,646
-Ah, who knows?

170
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:00,246
-Hey you.

171
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,446
I'm warning you.

172
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,046
Don't try to influence
the outcome of this game.

173
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,446
-Oh, excuse me.

174
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:08,746
Your game is so exciting that
the lines have become blurred.

175
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,679
You want to make things easier
for the judges, don't you?

176
00:08:11,713 --> 00:08:12,646
[frustrated sigh]

177
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:18,213
-Well, gee.

178
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:19,446
Thanks.

179
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,679
-I don't like the
timing of this timeout.

180
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:24,113
-He did a good job of
cooling off Momo's energy.

181
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:27,179
-Yeah, but I strongly suspect
he has something else in mind

182
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:28,713
he hopes to accomplish as well.

183
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,879
-Hey look.

184
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:33,946
-He's coming this way.

185
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,646
-What's he doing?

186
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,213
ALL: Huh?

187
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:40,713
-It's just too bad it
has to be this way.

188
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:41,979
Isn't it, Inui?

189
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:44,113
The rules say the only one
who can coach the players

190
00:08:44,146 --> 00:08:46,446
in a match is the bench
coach on the court.

191
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:49,046
-The bench coach can be
either a registered player

192
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:50,813
or one of the team's advisers.

193
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:53,779
What exactly are you
getting at, Mizuki?

194
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:54,813
-Oh.

195
00:08:54,846 --> 00:08:56,479
Well, if you have
made it is a regular,

196
00:08:56,513 --> 00:08:58,846
you could have been the one
up there now coaching them

197
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,513
to victory.

198
00:09:00,546 --> 00:09:01,013
Haha.

199
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,820
-Well, if you had
made it as a regular,

200
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:18,753
you could have been the one up
there coaching them to victory.

201
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:20,520
-What do you mean coaching them?

202
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:21,353
How can that be?

203
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:23,420
I have nothing to tell them.

204
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:25,086
MALE SPEAKER: You
there, if you're done,

205
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,720
return to your place.

206
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:27,586
-Ha.

207
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,320
That's just sour grapes talking.

208
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:30,453
And you know it, Inui.

209
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:36,320
-Who is that guy?

210
00:09:36,353 --> 00:09:36,920
He's hateful.

211
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:39,053
-He sure it.

212
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:41,720
-It appears as though this
is all part of the scenario

213
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:42,220
as well.

214
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:47,620
ANNOUNCER: Game
count 5 games to 2.

215
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,120
St. Rudolph leads.

216
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:51,353
Yanagisawa of St.
Rudolph to serve.

217
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,553
-Sure enough!

218
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:06,553
[cheering]

219
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:07,520
-You can do it, Rudolph!

220
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:08,553
Come on!

221
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:09,553
You can do it!

222
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:12,053
[cheering]

223
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:13,386
-Kaidoh!

224
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,353
-Don't order me around.

225
00:10:18,353 --> 00:10:20,286
-They're so persistent.

226
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,020
They keep hitting
to our weak sides.

227
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:28,686
-You guys sure are
really very tenacious.

228
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,486
[grunts]

229
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,620
-But we really love
games like this.

230
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:35,620
[grunts]

231
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:38,986
-Ha.

232
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,720
Right, Atsushi?

233
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:41,220
-It's great fun.

234
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:42,353
[grunt]

235
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:44,686
-What's fun about this?

236
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,653
MIZUKI (VOICEOIVER): Shutting
down Momoshiro's overhead smash

237
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:49,153
is huge.

238
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:52,186
It's almost impossible to make
that shot at the middle school

239
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,453
level.

240
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,553
And if he's allowed to hit
it, he'll take advantage.

241
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:58,720
We must not give him any lobs.

242
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:01,853
The only ball our two agile
players cannot return is

243
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:04,253
Kaidoh's snake.

244
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:06,486
However, I've spoken
to the school coach.

245
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,653
And the countermeasure against
the snake is fail safe.

246
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:13,620
Haha.

247
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:14,520
-Ah!

248
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:15,286
Another rally?

249
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Why can't they finish it?

250
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:17,486
-It's obvious.

251
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,186
Rudolph has studied
Momoshiro and Kaidoh well.

252
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,053
That's why they keep aiming for
their weak spots on the court.

253
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:26,653
-Everything is that
manager's fault.

254
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,320
-To prevent Momoshiro from
using his overhead smash,

255
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:31,353
their placing
their shots deftly.

256
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:32,920
-And leaves our guys
with their hands

257
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,253
full just returning shots.

258
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:35,653
-This is really bad.

259
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:38,786
-They have to create openings
so they can make their comeback.

260
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,653
Ryoma, where are you going?

261
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:43,386
-I'm going to go buy some juice.

262
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,686
-This is no time
for buying juice.

263
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,953
Can't you see, Echizen,
that our team is in a pinch?

264
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:49,853
-In a pinch?

265
00:11:49,886 --> 00:11:51,320
What do you mean by that?

266
00:11:51,353 --> 00:11:53,753
-St. Rudolph has our
team thoroughly scouted,

267
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:56,720
and their data is
practically perfect.

268
00:11:56,753 --> 00:12:00,020
-Then that practically spells
the end for St. Rudolph.

269
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,320
Those two won't play
according to their data.

270
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,253
[groan]

271
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:09,253
-Huh?

272
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:12,886
What the-- ah!

273
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,620
ANNOUNCER: Deuce again.

274
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:17,953
-Am I seeing things, or did the
speed of that shot increase?

275
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:18,686
[gasps]

276
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:23,986
-Not wild enough, huh?

277
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:35,220
Just not wild enough.

278
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,020
-Looks like they're
ready to play.

279
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,653
-Hey, Kaidoh.

280
00:12:43,686 --> 00:12:45,553
Don't tell me you're going to
use that shot on this tennis

281
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:45,986
court.

282
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,586
Are you?

283
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,653
-Shut up, you.

284
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:48,720
-Listen to me.

285
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:50,553
-Can't you see those
two react the minute

286
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:53,553
you take the stance
for the snake?

287
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:56,920
And by the looks of it,
they've practiced quite a bit.

288
00:12:56,953 --> 00:13:00,353
Aren't you nervous that they
can return the snake shot?

289
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:03,253
-It's not just a matter
of hitting it, stupid.

290
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:04,886
-Oh, are they fighting again?

291
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,120
-Haven't you noticed, those two
haven't made any eye contact

292
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:09,953
during the entire
course of this match.

293
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:12,420
-What are you two mumbling
about, sure enough?

294
00:13:12,453 --> 00:13:14,786
-Why don't you mind your
own business and shut up?

295
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,720
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER): I can
do whatever I want, huh?

296
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:35,720
-Hmm.

297
00:13:35,753 --> 00:13:36,686
-Oh man.

298
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,286
It looks like
Kaidoh is going to--

299
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,620
-Kaidoh isn't even good
at receiving serves,

300
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,286
but yet he's the
one in position.

301
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,486
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER):
Curse all of them.

302
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
-It's begun.

303
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:52,986
-Kaidoh is finally
ready to play at last.

304
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,086
Sorry, Mizuki, but our guys hate
to receive any kind of advice

305
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,220
during a match.

306
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,286
[hiss]

307
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,786
-Haha.

308
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,153
It's finally coming.

309
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:12,386
Time to show off what we've been
practicing for, sure enough.

310
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:16,020
[grunt]

311
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:17,053
-Don't hold back, Kaidoh.

312
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:23,520
Smash it if you can!

313
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:24,620
-Yeah!

314
00:14:24,653 --> 00:14:28,453
Momoshiro's charging
straight for the net!

315
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:29,953
-The court is wide open.

316
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:37,920
-FANS: Get it, Kaidoh!

317
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:41,220
-It seems Momoshiro opened
up the left court on purpose

318
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:42,353
to lure the ball there.

319
00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:42,986
-Go Kaidoh!

320
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,753
-He can do it.

321
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:45,086
He'll use the snake.

322
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,786
-Yes.

323
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
By all means, go for it.

324
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,286
[laughing]

325
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,153
-But wait.

326
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,186
That's not--

327
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,553
-He's not going to
use the snake shot.

328
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,220
[gasp]

329
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:27,686
[gasp]

330
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,653
[sigh]

331
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,453
[hiss]

332
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:38,020
-Oh.

333
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:40,286
That scared me.

334
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,253
Oh my.

335
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:43,120
Advantage to the receiver.

336
00:15:43,153 --> 00:15:43,886
-ALL: All right!

337
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,020
Kaidoh's boomerang snake!

338
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:47,020
-Those guys are amazing.

339
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:47,653
-Whoa!

340
00:15:47,686 --> 00:15:48,086
-That was amazing!

341
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,753
-Whoa!

342
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:49,753
-What was that shot!

343
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:52,486
[spectators talking]

344
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,353
-Hey, that wasn't
in the data report.

345
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,686
That was no snake.

346
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,786
I have my doubt that that
was even an admissible

347
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,053
shot, sure enough.

348
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:00,686
-What is happening here?

349
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
-At this rate we can win!

350
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:02,186
We can win!

351
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,720
Yeah!

352
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,553
-All right.

353
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:04,686
They're gonna make a comeback!

354
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,753
BOTH: Go to it, Kaidoh and Momo!

355
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:07,620
BOTH: That's great!

356
00:16:07,653 --> 00:16:08,153
That's great!

357
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:09,553
That's great!

358
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:11,720
-We've still got a ways to go.

359
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:12,686
-Huh?

360
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,320
Hey, it looks like Ryoma's back.

361
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:17,886
-You haven't perfected
that shot, have you?

362
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,786
-Huh?

363
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,020
Ugh.

364
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:22,420
-If this were singles, that
ball would have been out.

365
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:23,453
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER): Huh.

366
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,020
Huh.

367
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,120
If it stays within the
singles boundaries,

368
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:32,420
then it's 100% good.

369
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,853
-Now I understand
why it was decided

370
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:41,753
that Kaidoh ought to play in
a doubles match this time.

371
00:16:41,786 --> 00:16:42,786
-Well, yes.

372
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,386
But there's another
thing to consider.

373
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,453
Some watch a play like
that and get pumped.

374
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:48,120
-I don't know about that.

375
00:16:48,153 --> 00:16:50,586
Just because he sees
his rival's super shot,

376
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,086
there's no reason to think that.

377
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,053
Momo's not that naive.

378
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:58,520
-Don't even think
I'll ever lose to him.

379
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:00,486
-Momoshiro is that naive.

380
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,953
-I see what you mean.

381
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:09,820
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
That round the pole

382
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:13,120
shot that Kaidoh used in the
district matches, that was just

383
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:15,420
an accidental shot
because his foot slipped.

384
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:17,453
It was a onetime shot.

385
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:19,020
-A boomerang snake, huh?

386
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:22,286
-Who gave it a ridiculous
name like that anyway?

387
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
-It doesn't matter.

388
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:25,053
In any case, that
boomerang snake

389
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,753
is just an extension
of his snake shot.

390
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:29,153
I'm sure of it.

391
00:17:29,186 --> 00:17:32,353
-Mizuki drummed the strategy for
the snake shot into our heads.

392
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,720
I know we can counter
it, sure enough.

393
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:35,920
-All right.

394
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:37,720
I'm finally beginning to
see some passion out there

395
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:38,453
on the court.

396
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:42,286
[heavy breathing]

397
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,453
-A long match in
this kind of heat.

398
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:49,920
Both sides have little stamina
left in them right now.

399
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,886
But our boys mustn't
lose willpower.

400
00:17:56,386 --> 00:17:58,320
-It's the boomerang snake.

401
00:17:58,353 --> 00:17:59,820
-Sure enough.

402
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:01,786
[grunt]

403
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,753
-Huh?

404
00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:05,053
-It's a snake shot.

405
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,153
-Looks like St. Rudolph--

406
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:11,086
-It's a lob.

407
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,220
---was expecting
a boomerang snake.

408
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:14,153
-Now's your chance, guys.

409
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:15,320
-A lob?

410
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:17,720
How many times did I
tell them not to hit one?

411
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:21,153
-Ahh!

412
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:31,720
-Look how high Momoshiro gets!

413
00:18:31,753 --> 00:18:32,720
-Whoa!

414
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:35,186
-Momo's timing
couldn't be better.

415
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,686
-Ahh!

416
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,653
Yeah!

417
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:43,153
There!

418
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:50,120
[gasps]

419
00:18:53,653 --> 00:18:55,020
-What the--

420
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:56,920
SPECTATOR: I've never
seen anything like it.

421
00:18:56,953 --> 00:18:58,320
SPECTATOR: Seigaku is amazing.

422
00:18:58,353 --> 00:18:59,720
ANNOUNCER: Game to Seigaku.

423
00:18:59,753 --> 00:19:01,186
5 games to 3.

424
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,186
ALL: That's it!

425
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,353
Momo's overhead smash wins it!

426
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:07,120
-That wasn't just
an overhead smash.

427
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:09,920
He used the added momentum
of rushing forward

428
00:19:09,953 --> 00:19:11,453
when he hit the overhead.

429
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:14,153
Because of that, he was able
to double the normal force

430
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,053
that his usual overhead
jump generates.

431
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:22,453
I've never seen a dunk smash as
awesomely powerful as that one.

432
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:23,153
ALL: Oh.

433
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:24,953
Momo is totally awesome!

434
00:19:24,986 --> 00:19:26,353
-I can't believe it!

435
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:29,520
We were distracted by Kaidoh's
boomerang snake, sure enough.

436
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:30,320
I'm so mad.

437
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:31,753
We were asking for it.

438
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:34,353
Sure enough, we allowed
them to play their game.

439
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,086
-But his power.

440
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,086
-Huh?

441
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,686
-It increased.

442
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,020
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
What happened?

443
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:45,020
Their skill level has gone up.

444
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:46,586
Their power at the
district matches

445
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,053
doesn't compare to
their power now.

446
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:54,453
Those two, they're getting
better as the matches progress.

447
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:55,120
[groan]

448
00:20:01,353 --> 00:20:02,753
[hiss]

449
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,920
-It's just not wild enough.

450
00:20:16,953 --> 00:20:19,423
Just not wild enough.

451
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:02,829
-Hello, I'm Assistant
Captain Shuichiro Oishi.

452
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:06,129
St. Rudolph's Akazawa and
Kaneda are formidable opponents.

453
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:08,596
They focus their
attack on Eiji, hoping

454
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:11,063
to wear him down
mentally and physically.

455
00:21:11,096 --> 00:21:12,696
He's feeling the pressure.

456
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,096
But listen, Rudolphs,
this is doubles.

457
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:17,829
We'll show you why we're
called the Golden Pair.

458
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:23,096
Next on "Prince of
Tennis," the moon volley.

459
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:24,829
All right, Eiji.

460
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:27,896
Now, let's return that ball.
