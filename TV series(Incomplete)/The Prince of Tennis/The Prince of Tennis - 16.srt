1
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:08,381
-Hey.

2
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:10,282
I've heard that your
nickname is Viper.

3
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:11,115
-Hm?

4
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:14,149
-It fits you perfectly. [scoffs]

5
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:14,715
-Kaido!

6
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:16,215
Don't do it!

7
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:18,182
[gasps and screams]

8
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:21,649
[theme music]

9
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:38,243
-Unh!

10
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:42,210
-Here!

11
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,676
-Unh!

12
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,176
-Hu-unh!

13
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:53,143
-Uh!

14
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:02,776
-Unh-huh.

15
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,510
-(THINKING) He slipped!

16
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:04,576
Now's my chance.

17
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,510
Unh!

18
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:06,943
-Hunh!

19
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,576
Ah!

20
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,110
-No way!

21
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:09,210
Not again!

22
00:02:09,243 --> 00:02:10,210
-Unh!

23
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:12,676
-Ha-uh!

24
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,743
-A diving volley.

25
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:14,876
-Wow!

26
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,910
I'm amazed he can react
like that in this rain.

27
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:19,876
-It's like he's an acrobat.

28
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,343
-The only person who can
support an acrobatic player

29
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:25,076
like Kikumaru is Oishi,
with his wide field

30
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,976
of vision and ability to
respond to any situation.

31
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,076
That's how a real Two Guardian
technique should work.

32
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,810
Are you listening?

33
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:42,643
-What kind of moves are those?

34
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:44,810
(THINKING) He's already
there to return it!

35
00:02:44,843 --> 00:02:47,310
-(THINKING) He unbelievable!

36
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:49,276
-How'd you like that?

37
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,243
-Unh!

38
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:51,210
-Uh!

39
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:52,610
Gah!

40
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:53,643
[crowd gushes admiration]

41
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:54,643
FEMALE: Can you believe that?

42
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:55,276
MALE: Oh!

43
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,076
That was so cool.

44
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,743
-(SEVERAL TOGETHER) Hooray!

45
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,910
He did It!

46
00:02:57,943 --> 00:03:00,543
TOURNAMENT ANNOUNCER:
Game and match, Seigaku.

47
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:01,043
-Victor.

48
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:01,810
-Victory!

49
00:03:01,843 --> 00:03:02,543
-Yeah!

50
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:03,810
-They won the match!

51
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:06,543
-Seigaku's golden
pair is amazing!

52
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:09,110
-We're one and one now.

53
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:10,043
-Aheh.

54
00:03:10,076 --> 00:03:10,610
-Thank you.

55
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:16,743
-I'm sorry, Tachibana,
but we lost.

56
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:17,376
-No.

57
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,810
You did well.

58
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:20,876
You're the only ones
who are able to win two

59
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,710
from that pair in
district matches.

60
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:27,276
You'll get them back next time.

61
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:27,943
-(TOGETHER) Sir!

62
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:38,476
-Mr. Inoue?

63
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,576
-Hm?

64
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,376
-Are you taking shelter
from the rain here?

65
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,110
The tournament organizers are
trying to decide whether or not

66
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:47,010
matches should continue
while it's raining.

67
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:48,276
-Hm.

68
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,343
It's coming down harder.

69
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,776
-Mm.

70
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,410
Is something bothering you ?

71
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:55,710
Just don't seem like
your usual self.

72
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:57,543
You're acting like you're
not very interested

73
00:03:57,576 --> 00:03:59,076
in any of the matches.

74
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,276
-That's not the case at all.

75
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,943
It's just that--

76
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:01,443
-Hm?

77
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:06,976
-I was just thinking
that Tachibana seem big.

78
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,276
-You really think so?

79
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,543
I mean, I don't think he
looks like he's that tall.

80
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:11,343
-Not in height.

81
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,176
I meant in terms of caliber.

82
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,010
He has the solid trust
of the underclassmen.

83
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:18,910
They're like a monolithic,
with Tachibana as their core.

84
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:21,610
Perhaps the strength
of Fudomine lies

85
00:04:21,643 --> 00:04:24,043
in their feelings of total
confidence in their team

86
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:26,543
captain.

87
00:04:26,576 --> 00:04:29,343
-It's not like you to
praise them so much.

88
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,210
-Kaoru, you're next aren't you?

89
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:43,743
-Hm.

90
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:51,510
-Have they decided
to call it off?

91
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:52,610
-Not yet.

92
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:54,076
They're waiting to see
if the rain lets up.

93
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,076
If it does, then they'll
start the singles

94
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,576
and we can get on with it.

95
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,810
-So I guess it's not clear
if we're continuing or not.

96
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,976
-We'll just have to wait and
see what the weather does.

97
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,176
-It's like leaving a snake
lying around half-dead.

98
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,143
-Hm?

99
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:08,643
Hm.

100
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:13,443
KAMIO: Doesn't look
like it's going to stop.

101
00:05:13,476 --> 00:05:14,743
-Kamio, don't relax too much.

102
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:16,510
We don't know if they're
going to call off

103
00:05:16,543 --> 00:05:19,576
the rest of the
matches today or not.

104
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,276
-Hm.

105
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,976
You're right, Captain.

106
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,676
-[sighs deeply]

107
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,243
That's Kaido.

108
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:42,976
Where's he going?

109
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,010
MOMO: Don't worry about him.

110
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,976
-Momo, what's going on?

111
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,643
-Viper needs to be alone to
work on his concentration.

112
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:52,610
-Concentration?

113
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,076
-Anyone who wants
to win knows they

114
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,510
have to go into a match totally
psyched up to play, right?

115
00:05:57,543 --> 00:06:00,143
So Viper's been psyching
himself up all this time

116
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:03,376
while watching the games
because he wants to win so much.

117
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,943
And now, looks like the rain
has interfered with his chance.

118
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:06,443
-(ALL) Oh!

119
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:16,543
-(THINKING) OK.

120
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,043
[beep]

121
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:19,976
[muted music]

122
00:06:27,576 --> 00:06:30,643
-Tezuka, I think that guy is
getting ready for a battle.

123
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:32,076
-Mm?

124
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,876
-Look at him over there.

125
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,843
KATSUO: Boy, he sure seems
confident, doesn't he,

126
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:38,910
listening to music like that?

127
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:40,476
-Hey, that's what
you might think,

128
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,110
but he's not just
listening to music.

129
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:44,210
-(BOTH) Huh?

130
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:45,410
-You see, I've got a
feeling he's doing it

131
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:47,510
so his muscles don't cool down.

132
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:48,943
-So his muscles don't cool down?

133
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:50,943
SATOSHI: There's no telling
when the matches are

134
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:52,476
going to resume, right?

135
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,443
Well, that's why he's moving
his body to the music.

136
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:58,243
To keep his muscles warmed
up so they don't go stiff.

137
00:06:58,276 --> 00:06:59,510
-(BOTH) Oh, is that true?

138
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:01,076
Horio, you're amazing.

139
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,110
-Well, after all, I have been
playing tennis for two years.

140
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:06,076
-Say, do you know
where Ryoma is?

141
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,443
-Well, isn't he
where he should be?

142
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:10,010
Oh!

143
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:10,576
You're right.

144
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,843
He isn't there.

145
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:13,510
Well, how about that guy?

146
00:07:13,543 --> 00:07:16,576
Taking off without even telling
anyone where he's going.

147
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,910
-Come on, let's go look for him.

148
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:22,843
-Tezuka, based on
my calculations,

149
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,510
Number Three Singles Kamio
and Number Two Singles Ibu

150
00:07:25,543 --> 00:07:29,410
won't be as easy to handle
the Number One Doubles was.

151
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:33,143
And besides, there's the matter
of their captain, Tachibana.

152
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,043
He's no ordinary player.

153
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:40,110
You'll have to keep alert.

154
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:52,776
I guess the two captains are
carrying on a silent battle.

155
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,543
-Hm.

156
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:02,076
It should stop raining soon.

157
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:10,476
[panting]

158
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:10,943
-This-s-s.

159
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:25,444
[grunting] S-s-s.

160
00:08:43,676 --> 00:08:44,776
-I'm feeling the rhythm.

161
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:02,318
[distant thunder]

162
00:09:09,353 --> 00:09:10,419
-Oh, there he is.

163
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:11,786
Let's go over there.

164
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,586
-OK!

165
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,034
SATOSHI: Hey, Echizen!

166
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,801
The Fudomine team's getting
ready for their matches.

167
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,667
You can feel the electricity.

168
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:23,934
Huh, but as usual, you
don't seem tense at all.

169
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,401
-[yawns]

170
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:27,734
-Uh, it's no good.

171
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,367
-Oh.

172
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,667
Uh, what's going.

173
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,467
You guys planning your strategy?

174
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,467
Oh, Mr. Inoue.

175
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:33,967
-Mm.

176
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:41,234
Did you all get the same vibe?

177
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:43,101
There's a reason
why Fudomine has

178
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:45,667
a strength that the
other schools don't have.

179
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:46,634
SAKUNO: A reason?

180
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:47,534
-Yes.

181
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:48,634
You can call it
whatever you want,

182
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,634
but I think of it
as their will power.

183
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:53,401
It supports their faith
in their own victory.

184
00:09:53,434 --> 00:09:54,767
They take great
pride in the fact

185
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:56,601
that, together, they've
been able to make it

186
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:58,401
this far all on their own.

187
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:01,167
That seems to be the
source of their strength.

188
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,601
They're not a team that you
can beat with technique alone.

189
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,534
[meow]

190
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,667
[wood breaking]

191
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:15,367
MALE: Hey!

192
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:17,034
Tachibana.

193
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,167
Last time we cut
you a lot of slack,

194
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,801
but it seems like you just
don't want to learn, do you?

195
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:30,967
-You!

196
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:32,667
You're a failure as an adviser.

197
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,634
[grunting and struggling]

198
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,134
[bodies land heavily]

199
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:47,234
-(ALL CHANTING) Nationals.

200
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:48,301
Nationals!

201
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:48,801
Nationals!

202
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:58,967
-(ALL) Oh!

203
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:03,401
-Mm-mh.

204
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:05,367
-Oh.

205
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:09,301
-They have great pride in what
they've built-up on their own.

206
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:10,801
That sense of
accomplishment is what

207
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,834
holds them all
together as a team.

208
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:17,534
That is the secret behind
Fudomine's strength.

209
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,701
-Fudomine's amazing.

210
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:24,101
-There's no way we can win
against a team like that.

211
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:24,601
-Hm.

212
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:28,501
Hm?

213
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:29,001
-(ALL) Hm?

214
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:35,967
-But tennis is tennis, right?

215
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:42,767
You just chase after
a ball and hit it.

216
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:43,234
-Huh.

217
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:46,534
-Hey, Echizen.

218
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:47,267
Hold on!

219
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:48,567
Where are you going?

220
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:56,801
[receding footsteps]

221
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:59,467
-Tennis is tennis?

222
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:00,801
-(ALL) Huh?

223
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,567
-He may be right.

224
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:04,301
What's important
is not the past.

225
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:05,434
It's the present!

226
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:06,901
-Yes, you are absolutely right.

227
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:16,101
-It looks like we're
going to continue.

228
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,734
By the way, any
idea where Kaido is?

229
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:21,734
-Probably doing
visualization training.

230
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:24,867
-Hey, what does
visualization training mean.

231
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:25,934
-[clears throat loudly]

232
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:26,801
-(TOGETHER) Oh, yeah.

233
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,167
You must know.

234
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:29,801
-Now, listen up, you two.

235
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,934
When you use
visualization, for example,

236
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,767
you can use this towel to
shut out what's around you.

237
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:37,567
And then concentrate
on imagining

238
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:39,201
how you would play
a certain game.

239
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:40,567
You get it now?

240
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,234
-Wow.

241
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:42,434
-I get it, too!

242
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:45,434
-If you do a good enough
job of visualizing the game,

243
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:47,434
then when the time comes,
you can play your game

244
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,067
without getting flustered.

245
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,367
And that's just all about--

246
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,034
-Uh--

247
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:51,801
---paying attention.

248
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:52,334
Ow.

249
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:53,401
Uh-ho, oh.

250
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:54,967
Yeah, Tezuko, 10 miles
around the field.

251
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:56,834
KACHIRO: He must be
using visualization.

252
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:57,401
KATSUO: Yeah.

253
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:01,667
-Well, look who's here.

254
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:03,834
You're late Number
Three Singles.

255
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,634
-[growls]

256
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,601
-Good luck with your match-up.

257
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:08,434
-Listen, newbie.

258
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:09,934
I don't need that from you.

259
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:13,267
-Hey, Kaido, your opponent
isn't Echizen, so cool it.

260
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:13,767
-OK.

261
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:23,001
TOURNAMENT ANNOUNCER:
Number Three Singles!

262
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:24,901
Kaido of Seigaku.

263
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,067
Kamio of Fudomine.

264
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:54,967
-Hey!

265
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,934
I've heard that your
nickname is Viper.

266
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:57,634
-Huh?

267
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,167
-It fits you perfectly.

268
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:00,134
[scoffs]

269
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,601
-S-s-s!

270
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:03,001
Unh-uh!

271
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:03,867
-Kaido, don't do it!

272
00:14:03,901 --> 00:14:04,367
-Unh!

273
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:05,101
Unh-uh!

274
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:07,634
[crowd gasps and screams]

275
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:10,567
-[growls] Uh.

276
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,101
-Hey, you've got a
pretty fast swing there.

277
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:14,167
-You.

278
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:15,367
What on earth do you
think you're doing?

279
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:16,867
-[growls]

280
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:17,734
-Kaido!

281
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:18,601
-Hunh?

282
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:20,001
Huh.

283
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:21,401
I'm sorry.

284
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:22,934
-You be careful from now on.

285
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:28,367
-I apologize for Kaido's act.

286
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,467
-There's no question he
was provoked by Kamio,

287
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:33,701
so please accept my
apology for his behavior.

288
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:36,267
-This is going to be an
incredible match-up, you guys.

289
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:37,067
-Yeah.

290
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:39,267
-They're both scary players.

291
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:40,767
TOURNAMENT ANNOUNCER:
One set match.

292
00:14:40,801 --> 00:14:44,434
Kamio of Fudomine to serve.

293
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:44,934
-Hu-unh!

294
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:51,301
-(THINKING) He's taking
the net after serving.

295
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:52,734
How stupid can he be?

296
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,601
He's left the court wide open.

297
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:55,601
Unh!

298
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:56,834
-Kaido got him on
his unguarded side.

299
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,101
-Unh!

300
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:06,101
-Unbelievable!

301
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:09,334
You see how fast he returned it?

302
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,301
-Huh?

303
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:12,701
[growls]

304
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:14,701
-Huh.

305
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:17,667
-How in the world was he
able to catch up to that ball

306
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:18,401
and return it?

307
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:30,367
-[chuckles softly]

308
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:32,534
-I'm feeling the rhythm.

309
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:37,867
-[growls] I don't like the delay
hurry up and serve the ball

310
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:38,734
already, will you?

311
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:39,667
-Hmph.

312
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:40,201
Hu-unh!

313
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:44,834
-He sent it to the corner!

314
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,934
-Now Kaido can
use his best shot!

315
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,834
-(THINKING) This
should finish it!

316
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:49,334
Yah!

317
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:50,034
S-s-s.

318
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:50,734
-(TOGETHER) Yeah!

319
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:54,067
It's Kaido's Snake Shot!

320
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:57,401
-Wow, look at the
angle of that shot!

321
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,434
-(THINKING) That's
Seigaku, all right.

322
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:01,234
To think they have
a player who can

323
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:03,967
do the Snake Shot so easily.

324
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:08,201
But we've got the speed ace
Akira Kamio on our team.

325
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:11,301
Kaido and Seigaku are
out of luck this time.

326
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:11,801
Hm.

327
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:17,101
-Unh!

328
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:29,234
-Well, you sure have
confidence in your quickness.

329
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:30,401
-Ha-ha!

330
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:33,401
He really doesn't know
what he's in for, does he?

331
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:37,067
-Seigaku strengthened their
doubles team trying to win.

332
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:39,901
Now, their seventh and eighth
graders have to play singles.

333
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:42,101
-But their strategy
is doomed to fail

334
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,801
because they've
underestimated us.

335
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:45,834
Our singles players
are even more dominant

336
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:48,934
than our doubles players.

337
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,901
-As far as speed is
concerned, no one

338
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:52,967
comes close to topping Akira.

339
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:56,967
-So when will I see
more of your Snake Shot?

340
00:16:57,001 --> 00:17:01,001
-How can Kaido's Snake Shot
be so easy for him to return?

341
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:03,101
-And so fast!

342
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:04,501
-Hm-umh!

343
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:05,534
-You think you're so hot?

344
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,367
S-s-s gah!

345
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,501
-Ooh, it's another Snake Shot!

346
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:13,101
-Still too slow, Viper.

347
00:17:13,134 --> 00:17:14,367
-(TOGETHER) Wha--?

348
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,234
-Unh!

349
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,301
-Nohm uhuh!

350
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,634
Uh ooh.

351
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,534
Oh.

352
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,767
-Kaido!

353
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,201
[all gasp]

354
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:24,567
-[low growl] Unh.

355
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:26,234
The average player
would probably

356
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:28,767
be running all over the course
to return one of your Snake

357
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:31,601
Shots and he'd soon
run out of steam.

358
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:36,134
But this is the right
speed for me. [scoffs]

359
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,167
-This guys probably the
worst opponent Kaido

360
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:39,201
could have drawn.

361
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:40,101
-Yeah.

362
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:41,834
When the Snake's
returned like that,

363
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:44,034
it can land at an
even tougher angle.

364
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:46,634
It becomes a double-edged
sword for Kaoru.

365
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:49,234
It could be a tough
match for him.

366
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:50,301
EIJI: Yeah.

367
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:52,601
In any case, the court
is wet with rain.

368
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:55,067
The ball gets heavier after
absorbing the water, which

369
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:57,701
seems to lessen the
power of the Snake.

370
00:17:57,734 --> 00:18:00,501
-Is that why his Snake
isn't having much effect?

371
00:18:00,534 --> 00:18:01,934
-No.

372
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:04,201
It's because his opponent is
moving too quickly for it, even

373
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:06,567
though court conditions
don't favor it.

374
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:07,534
He's just too fast.

375
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:12,567
-I'm feeling the rhythm.

376
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:21,467
The rhythm's perfect.

377
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,467
Unh!

378
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,967
Hm.

379
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:29,867
-[grunting] Eh, kah.

380
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,701
-Stepping up the rhythm!

381
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:33,301
-Speed Ace?

382
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:34,734
Yeah, right.

383
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:36,634
-[chuckling]

384
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:38,601
-[panting] Ahh.

385
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:43,434
Don't make me laugh.

386
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,967
Never underestimate Kaoru Kaido!

387
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:53,901
No!

388
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:55,401
I will not lose!

389
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:03,334
-Huh?

390
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:04,334
-Uh-h.

391
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:06,334
Uh, unh, ah.

392
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,301
-Huh?

393
00:19:07,334 --> 00:19:12,767
[gasps from onlookers]

394
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:14,067
-Hunh-uh.

395
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:14,734
-Hey.

396
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,467
It went around the net.

397
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:20,134
That doesn't count as a
legal shot, does it, huh?

398
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:21,700
-S-s-s!

399
00:19:26,816 --> 00:19:27,716
-Wow!

400
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,782
-To think we'd see
a shot like that!

401
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:32,016
-Aw!

402
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:34,549
-Well, what kind
of return was that?

403
00:19:34,582 --> 00:19:36,649
-It curved just
like a boomerang!

404
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:39,482
-Boomerang plus a Snake Shot?

405
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:42,016
Does that make it a
Boomerang Snake Shot?

406
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,049
INUI: A Boomerang Snake.

407
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,616
-(TOGETHER) Huh?

408
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:45,716
-Interesting.

409
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:47,349
-A Boomerang Snake.

410
00:19:47,382 --> 00:19:48,682
-Oh, great!

411
00:19:48,716 --> 00:19:49,882
I can use that!

412
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,082
-They called it a
Boomerang Snake.

413
00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:53,449
-That sounds good.

414
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:54,882
MALE: That was unreal, dude!

415
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,049
TOURNAMENT ANNOUNCER: 40-15!

416
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,882
MALE: Did you have
your camera for that?

417
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,016
-Terrific play, Kaido.

418
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:03,249
Well done,

419
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:05,216
-Unh-enh, unh!

420
00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:11,049
[growls contentedly]

421
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:12,049
-Hey!

422
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:14,616
Not bad, Mr. Kaido.

423
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:16,449
-(THINKING) Boomerang Snake.

424
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:21,582
[chuckles] (THINKING)
Not bad, I guess-s-s.

425
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:27,258
[ending theme music]

426
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:56,340
KAMIO (VOICEOVER): Huh!

427
00:20:56,373 --> 00:20:59,006
I'm Kamio of Fudomine.

428
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,855
Viper has a Boomerang Snake?

429
00:21:00,888 --> 00:21:01,922
Huh.

430
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:04,188
It's probably some
outrageous trick play.

431
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,155
Anyway, it won't work on me.

432
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:10,488
I wondered just what
kind of team Seigaku had.

433
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:12,922
Well, we're doing pretty
well against them.

434
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:17,088
So Viper, let's see how
you keep up with my speed.

435
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:21,255
Next, on the "Prince of Tennis",
a little gesture of triumph.

436
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:23,888
I'm stepping up the rhythm.
