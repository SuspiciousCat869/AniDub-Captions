1
00:00:08,473 --> 00:00:10,406
-The first to win
three games wins.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,940
If you take this game, Echizen,
you'll win the tournament.

3
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:17,006
Go for it.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,940
-Come on, Ryoma, you can do it.

5
00:00:18,973 --> 00:00:19,873
-Go, Echizen!

6
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:21,906
-I can't wait to see Ryoma.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,640
It's his big debut
as a singles player.

8
00:00:24,673 --> 00:00:25,740
-Don't just stare at him.

9
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:27,206
Take some pictures.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,840
-Oh, yeah, you're right.

11
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:31,340
-Shinji Ibu of
Fudomine, he's the one

12
00:00:31,373 --> 00:00:33,840
who didn't let that seeded
player, Kooky, get close,

13
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:35,040
right?

14
00:00:35,073 --> 00:00:37,306
-Seigaku put a seventh
grader in that key number

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,373
two single slot.

16
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:40,173
I don't get it.

17
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,906
I feel kind of sorry for him.

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,140
Maybe it's a throwaway match.

19
00:00:47,106 --> 00:00:48,873
JUDGE: One set match.

20
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:52,206
Echizen of Seigaku to serve.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,640
[theme music]

22
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:18,303
-Hey you, you crouching
there, what are you doing?

23
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:21,203
-Oh, Uncle, I was just
cleaning up a little

24
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:22,836
and I found something
very interesting.

25
00:02:25,803 --> 00:02:26,536
Look at you.

26
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,136
You were so cute, Uncle.

27
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,070
You were in middle
school, isn't that right?

28
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:32,036
-Stop it.

29
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,036
Don't look at that.

30
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,570
Put it away.

31
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:35,903
-Don't do that.

32
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:38,070
You don't have to
be embarrassed.

33
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:38,870
Let go of it.

34
00:02:38,903 --> 00:02:40,303
-Just burn it, why don't ya?

35
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:41,270
-No way.

36
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:42,236
Leave it alone.

37
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,070
What's this?

38
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:47,136
She's pretty, isn't she?

39
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,370
Was she your advisor
in middle school?

40
00:02:53,136 --> 00:02:55,103
-She's an old hag by now.

41
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:57,703
Of course, I used to call her
hag back in those days too

42
00:02:57,736 --> 00:02:59,070
'cuz she really
got on my nerves.

43
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,003
I get so mad.

44
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:06,603
Just thinking about
her still gets me

45
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:08,636
all riled up, that old hag.

46
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,903
SUMIRE (VOICEOVER): Come
on, son of Nanjiroh.

47
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:27,670
Knock their socks off.

48
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,136
-Awesome, he started
right up with it.

49
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,236
-All right, a kick serve.

50
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,436
-Oh, what was that?

51
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,736
-It flew up into his face.

52
00:04:10,936 --> 00:04:15,003
-Hey, Judge, aren't you
going to make the call?

53
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:17,670
JUDGE: Uh, 15 love.

54
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:20,070
-What do you know,
our little guy's good.

55
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:22,236
With that serve of his,
his surprise attack

56
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,136
has everyone focusing on him.

57
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:39,103
-Another kick serve.

58
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,303
-Ah.

59
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:46,203
JUDGE: 30 love.

60
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:47,336
-Way to go, Echizen.

61
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,070
You can do it.

62
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:49,703
Finish him.

63
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:50,770
-What's going on?

64
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:53,803
-That seventh grader
is really something.

65
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:57,170
-Who was it who said Seigaku was
throwing away their number two

66
00:04:57,203 --> 00:04:58,936
singles?

67
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,170
-There's no way that
that seventh grader--

68
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:03,703
TACHIBANA KIPPEI (VOICEOVER):
Mastered a reverse spin serve.

69
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,103
There's no way.

70
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,470
-Oh, here comes another one.

71
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:19,936
-40 love.

72
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,903
-I can't believe you're really
Tachibana's younger sister.

73
00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:33,870
-Well, you're really Coach
Ryuzake's granddaughter,

74
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:34,436
aren't you.

75
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,470
-Huh?

76
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:36,936
-No reason for you
to be so surprised.

77
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,670
-How did you find that out?

78
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:40,636
-Oh, don't misunderstand me.

79
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,936
I mean, it's not like I'm a
spy or anything bad like that.

80
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,636
It's just I've always been
interested in my brother's

81
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,103
opponents on the court.

82
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:49,936
-Oh.

83
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,370
-Say, don't you think
Echizen's match has already

84
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:53,536
started by now?

85
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,436
-Oh, no.

86
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,103
I've gotta get back there quick.

87
00:05:57,136 --> 00:06:00,003
-I'm sure it's going to turn
out to be an amazing match.

88
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:01,703
It will probably
be the main event

89
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,003
of all the district matches.

90
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:07,570
You'd better hurry up.

91
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:08,036
-Oh.

92
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:19,736
TACHIBANA KIPPEI (VOICEOVER):
What a strong start.

93
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,470
But Shinji, you can handle him.

94
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,770
-That's crazy.

95
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:32,536
He's putting himself in
the path of the ball.

96
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,536
How did he return that?

97
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,436
-All right, that's our Shinji.

98
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,670
-It can't be.

99
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:45,636
-Ryoma, no.

100
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,803
-Game to Echizen.

101
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:59,336
-I think I'm feeling the rhythm
right now, wouldn't you say?

102
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,270
-How could Shinji lose
four straight points?

103
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:05,503
-And it's only been about a
minute since the game started.

104
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:08,370
-That Seigaku seventh
grader is really strong.

105
00:07:11,936 --> 00:07:14,136
-Boy, those eyes
bring back memories.

106
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:41,070
-Nanjiroh, try and see if
you can return this serve.

107
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:42,770
-Just leave me alone, you hag.

108
00:07:42,803 --> 00:07:43,536
I'm hungry.

109
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,003
Just finish up, will ya.

110
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:45,970
I need some grub.

111
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:47,703
-If you really
want to eat, you're

112
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:49,870
gonna have to try and
return this serve.

113
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,536
-The back spin?

114
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,036
You sure are demented.

115
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,236
-You were careless.

116
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,703
-Wah.

117
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:11,170
-You've still got a
ways to go, Nanjiroh,

118
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:14,970
and you'll never make it with
that slow backhand of yours.

119
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:19,103
-Ahh, why don't you shut
up, you mean old hag.

120
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:20,670
-Oh, yeah, I hear
you're planning

121
00:08:20,703 --> 00:08:24,903
to go on a date with Kimiko
from class three tomorrow.

122
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:27,270
-How did you find
out about that?

123
00:08:27,303 --> 00:08:29,203
-Poor little
Nanjiroh, you're going

124
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:31,270
on a date looking
like a panda bear.

125
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:36,303
-You!

126
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:38,670
You did that on purpose.

127
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:40,003
-That's right, I did.

128
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:43,836
Your fore hand's not so bad,
but your back hand's terrible.

129
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,170
That's why I keep forcing you
to use it over and over again.

130
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:48,603
And I've got news
for you, you're

131
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:50,236
going to keep working
on your backhand

132
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,803
until it either improves
or your arm falls off.

133
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:54,403
If you don't want
to look like a fool,

134
00:08:54,436 --> 00:08:56,970
you better fix that backhand.

135
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,203
I forbid you to use your
forehand, only your backhand,

136
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:03,003
got it?

137
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:08,870
As for your hot date tomorrow,
I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun.

138
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:10,136
-Shut up, you hag.

139
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:16,336
-So, how was your
date with Kimiko.

140
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,770
-Don't even ask.

141
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:21,903
She kept laughing out loud at
me and that was the end of that.

142
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,570
Hey, don't laugh.

143
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:25,403
The nerve.

144
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:33,303
Oh, Kimiko.

145
00:09:39,803 --> 00:09:42,470
-You're off to a
good start, Ryoma.

146
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:44,236
Right now, you're
opponent probably

147
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,936
thinks he's having
a bad dream, but all

148
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,970
dreams good and
bad end some time.

149
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:53,936
That moment will be important.

150
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,603
-He's always so cool.

151
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,870
-Yeah, but it wouldn't hurt
him to get a little tense

152
00:09:57,903 --> 00:09:58,570
once in awhile.

153
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:05,903
-Leave it to Seigaku to have
a seventh grader like him.

154
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:13,203
-A good environment
with nice upperclassmen.

155
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:15,670
yeah, but I think
seventh graders really

156
00:10:15,703 --> 00:10:17,803
ought to suffer more.

157
00:10:17,836 --> 00:10:22,703
How lucky I envy them, but
it makes me a little sick.

158
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:24,603
-Shinji's starting to mutter.

159
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:27,703
-His true colors are coming out.

160
00:10:27,736 --> 00:10:29,903
-He's cocky for
a seventh grader,

161
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:32,636
he better not get too
big headed though.

162
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,570
It makes me so sick.

163
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:36,070
I'll clobber him.

164
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,846
-Go, Echizen, you can do it.

165
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,546
Break his serve now!

166
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,980
-That was a long bathroom break.

167
00:10:53,013 --> 00:10:54,980
-Miss Shiba, how's Ryoma doing?

168
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:56,580
-He started out quite well.

169
00:10:56,613 --> 00:11:00,346
In fact, he held
his serve with ease.

170
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,346
TACHIBANA KIPPEI (VOICEOVER):
His starting serve

171
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,813
was a surprise, but Shinji,
it's time to hit back.

172
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:23,546
[gasps]

173
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,580
-Hm, that serve.

174
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,346
-Huh?

175
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:36,680
JUDGE: 15 love.

176
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:39,180
ALL: Was that a kick serve?

177
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:40,546
-No way.

178
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,813
I never thought there
was someone other

179
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:46,046
than Ryoma could do that.

180
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,280
-An eye for an eye.

181
00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:48,046
-You did it.

182
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,213
Shinji's twist serve.

183
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:51,780
-Twist serve?

184
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:53,913
But I could have sworn
that was a kick serve.

185
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,380
-They're pretty
much the same thing.

186
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:58,713
The twist serve is
the old name for it,

187
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:01,213
but I'd say there's a slight
bit of difference in spin

188
00:12:01,246 --> 00:12:05,113
and power between
the two serves.

189
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:06,413
-I can feel it.

190
00:12:06,446 --> 00:12:07,646
You're still hiding something.

191
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,946
I know you are.

192
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,480
There's something's not quite
right about the way you're

193
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:13,980
playing.

194
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,280
-Huh?

195
00:12:24,313 --> 00:12:24,913
ALL: All right.

196
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:28,046
-Go Ryoma.

197
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,846
-You're right.

198
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,680
-So he's really a South paw?

199
00:12:31,713 --> 00:12:34,746
-Well, now, let's stop this
dancing around and get down

200
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:41,513
to business, just you
and I. A South paw, hm?

201
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:45,280
-Hm, in order for me to get the
ball to fly it into your face,

202
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:47,180
I had to hit it
with my right hand.

203
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:52,613
But you were pretty quick to
figure out what I was doing.

204
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,113
That's good.

205
00:12:57,313 --> 00:12:59,880
-It's about time that
you lose a match.

206
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,713
You're way too arrogant.

207
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:16,113
ALL: He did it
again, a kick serve.

208
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:20,113
-He returned it.

209
00:13:25,613 --> 00:13:28,246
-It's amazing.

210
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,113
-Both of them seem to have let
down all their limitations.

211
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:34,346
Nobody can stop this match.

212
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,080
It won't end until
one of them collapses.

213
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:39,880
-He is just like his father.

214
00:13:39,913 --> 00:13:41,013
-What?

215
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:43,280
Are you saying that you
know Echizen's father?

216
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:46,280
-Yes, his father played on
the professional circuit.

217
00:13:46,313 --> 00:13:47,180
-Really?

218
00:13:47,213 --> 00:13:48,446
He was a pro?

219
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,146
What kind of a
tennis player was he?

220
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,480
Was he strong on
offense like Ryoma?

221
00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:55,046
Did he overpower his opponents?

222
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,446
-An offensive player?

223
00:14:02,546 --> 00:14:06,146
The word persevere was
just not in his dictionary.

224
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,613
All he did was attack.

225
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,913
With that awful backhand,
you'll never beat me.

226
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,780
-Don't underestimate me.

227
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:31,646
SUMIRE (VOICEOVER): His
backhand is much stronger.

228
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,413
-His play was totally flawless.

229
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:37,113
He had natural instincts and
speed and power to spare,

230
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:39,780
and most of all, he had
an extraordinary ability

231
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:40,846
to absorb.

232
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,646
-He was that great?

233
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,980
-He was.

234
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:47,613
He was one of the kind, but
he had an even rarer genius.

235
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:51,913
The truth is Nanjiroh Echizen
was a much greater monster

236
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:54,713
than I ever thought he was.

237
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:56,180
-Huh?

238
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:59,246
-If you ask me,
tennis is a fight.

239
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,380
-A fight?

240
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:01,580
But you followed your
teacher's instructions

241
00:15:01,613 --> 00:15:04,213
and kept practicing your
backhand like she said,

242
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:05,280
didn't you?

243
00:15:05,313 --> 00:15:06,480
-I didn't endure it.

244
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:08,980
I just wanted to pay her
back for ruining my date.

245
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:10,713
-Pay her back?

246
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:11,213
-Yeah.

247
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:17,846
I just had a great idea.

248
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,546
-A left-handed forehand?

249
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,046
-Quit all that jabbering
about forehands and backhands

250
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,846
and let's play.

251
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,913
I've decided I'm going to
start playing two sword style.

252
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:41,980
-You mean, Nanjiroh Echizen
figured out this two sword

253
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:43,480
style all by himself?

254
00:15:43,513 --> 00:15:44,513
-Right.

255
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:45,813
And that's how he
was able to overcome

256
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:47,546
that weak backhand of his.

257
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,746
Exceptional tennis players are
able to overcome each and every

258
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,913
wall they encounter
in the same way.

259
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:55,146
That's the kind of boy
Echizen's father was.

260
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,146
Looks like I lose this one.

261
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,613
You're becoming quite
the tennis player.

262
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:10,213
That's enough for today.

263
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:11,346
Good job.

264
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,446
-Hey, hey, hey.

265
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,880
I'm not through with you yet.

266
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:14,580
You running away?

267
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:19,146
And what is this?

268
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,946
It better not be a love
letter, because if it is,

269
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,280
I don't want it.

270
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:24,480
-It's a reward.

271
00:16:24,513 --> 00:16:26,146
Just try to accept
it graciously.

272
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:30,646
-A reward?

273
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:50,313
-But Uncle, you haven't told
me what the letter said.

274
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:52,613
-I don't recall,
but I have a feeling

275
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:55,713
it was some silly thing or
another that wasn't important.

276
00:16:55,746 --> 00:16:56,913
Huh?

277
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:58,913
Uh-oh, looks like it's
time to go ring the bell.

278
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,046
-Oh.

279
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,046
An American youth, a
15-year-old tennis prodigy,

280
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,913
sweeps the US tour.

281
00:17:20,946 --> 00:17:22,646
Will Wimbledon be next?

282
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,146
The world watches
in fascination.

283
00:17:30,913 --> 00:17:33,380
Echizen, tomorrow, the world.

284
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,213
-I finally understand.

285
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:44,480
-Understand what?

286
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:47,013
-That it's Nanjiroh
Echizen standing out

287
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,080
there on the court
before us right now.

288
00:17:52,746 --> 00:17:56,946
His power, speed,
reflexes, he far

289
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,313
exceeds most players
in all these areas.

290
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,146
His ability to take advantage
of his opponents predictions

291
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,146
is also flawless.

292
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,013
Ryoma's tennis is a carbon
copy of Nanjiroh Echizen's.

293
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,046
SUMIRE: It's unusual for you to
make such a strong assertion.

294
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,980
-But when Echizen manages to
climb over that wall, what will

295
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,213
he find?

296
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:21,046
It could make or
break him as a player.

297
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,180
-Hm, I wonder.

298
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:31,180
[crowd gasping]

299
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:33,813
-You know, the
two of them really

300
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,880
need to slow down their
pace a little bit.

301
00:18:35,913 --> 00:18:37,746
-I don't think those
guys are the types that

302
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,146
worry about pacing so much.

303
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,680
-You're correct, but still I'm
gathering some good data here

304
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:43,180
for later.

305
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:53,046
-Wow, he's going for the corner.

306
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:59,980
-Oh no, he's not gonna make it.

307
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:20,780
JUDGE: 15 all.

308
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:24,580
[crowd cheering]

309
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:25,913
-It's the two swords style.

310
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:30,113
-What's that?

311
00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:32,413
Two swords style maybe?

312
00:19:32,446 --> 00:19:34,380
-Well, yeah.

313
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:37,113
-Tennis isn't a
circus act, you know.

314
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:38,113
-What's wrong with that?

315
00:20:03,113 --> 00:20:08,113
Sorry, but I had no intention
of losing before the Nationals.

316
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:10,513
I won't lose at the
Nationals either.

317
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:25,513
[theme music]

318
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,180
-I'm Ibu of Fudomine
Junior High.

319
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:03,730
He makes me sick, that
Seigaku seventh grader,

320
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:06,897
letting loose and hitting
kick serves like that.

321
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,630
It makes me so sick.

322
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:11,530
But if you think I'm
just hitting balls,

323
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:13,397
you're greatly mistaken.

324
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,730
OK, I guess it's time
to get down to business.

325
00:21:17,764 --> 00:21:21,830
Next on "Prince of Tennis,
Battle-Scarred Ryoma."

326
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,364
Oh man, it's not even
my fault, you know?
