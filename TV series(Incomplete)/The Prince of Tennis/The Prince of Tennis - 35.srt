00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:18,094
[chuckling]

2
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,227
[theme music]

3
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,348
ANNOUNCER: 15-Love.

4
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:56,048
HORIO: Wow.

5
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,182
KACHIRO: This stinks.

6
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:59,982
Even if he can return
Yuta's on the rise shot,

7
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:02,282
he can't return that
twist spin shot.

8
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:05,048
KATSUO: Maybe Ryoma
should play right handed.

9
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:06,315
-You don't get it, do you?

10
00:02:06,348 --> 00:02:08,515
He'd be a sitting
duck for that lefty.

11
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:09,115
-Yeah, but--

12
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:32,615
-A twist spin shot.

13
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:34,582
Go for it, Ryoma!

14
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:37,515
KACHIRO: He's backing up
before the ball bounces.

15
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:38,648
-I see.

16
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:40,848
He's backing up to where
the ball loses energy.

17
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:43,648
HORIO: It won't help
if he can't reach it.

18
00:02:51,082 --> 00:02:52,748
-That took some hop.

19
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,548
He's way too small
to reach that.

20
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:01,682
That's some player.

21
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,982
[excited whispering]

22
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:05,882
ANNOUNCER: 30-Love.

23
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:07,415
-Ryoma's really
getting massacred.

24
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:09,048
-It looks that way.

25
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:11,148
-A twisting spin shot.

26
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:14,448
-Even if he could get that
ball taken on the rise,

27
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:18,048
Yuta's twist spin is tough.

28
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:19,415
Well, how's that?

29
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:23,648
A shot taken on the rise,
followed by a twist spin.

30
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:26,748
This is why Yuta's
the lefty killer.

31
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:28,382
So, tell me.

32
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:30,382
How are you planning
to fight back, Echizen?

33
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:45,748
-Now, I'll take it on the rise.

34
00:03:45,782 --> 00:03:49,948
And then the twist spin
shot Mizuki taught me.

35
00:03:49,982 --> 00:03:50,948
I'll show my brother.

36
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:59,248
-What's Ryoma doing?

37
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:02,215
-He's gonna shorten his swing
and take it on the rise?

38
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:03,248
-That's a bad idea.

39
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:04,682
One false step and
he'll get hurt.

40
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:05,182
-Ryoma!

41
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:14,015
-He took it on the rise.

42
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:21,948
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Too bad, Echizen.

43
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:24,882
When you take it on the rise,
if the angle of your racket face

44
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:28,815
is even a little off--

45
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:30,248
ANNOUNCER: Out.

46
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:31,948
40-Love.

47
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:34,915
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
You lose all control.

48
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:35,415
-Hm.

49
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:40,448
-The kid may be
good, but that shot's

50
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:41,782
a really hard one to make.

51
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:48,515
FUJI (VOICEOVER): You've
gotten good, Yuta.

52
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:55,148
YUTA (VOICEOVER): My
super on the rise shot

53
00:04:55,182 --> 00:04:56,382
isn't so easy to copy.

54
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:10,015
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Forget it, Echizen.

55
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:12,015
Even if you could
handle the first shot,

56
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:13,682
the second one is waiting.

57
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:21,082
-Oh no!

58
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:23,048
A twist spin shot!

59
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:27,448
-Oh!

60
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:29,415
Ryoma's going in again.

61
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:30,915
-You won't win like that.

62
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:42,715
ANNOUNCER: Out.

63
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:43,848
Game to St. Rudolph.

64
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:46,782
Four games to one.

65
00:05:46,815 --> 00:05:48,182
-Wow.

66
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:52,182
It may have been out, but it's
amazing he could return that.

67
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:52,948
-Yep.

68
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:54,248
That shot sure was tough.

69
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:57,348
I'd better watch it, or
I'll over hit it for sure.

70
00:05:57,382 --> 00:06:00,015
But at least I'm
still making it.

71
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:01,315
-Oh, I get it.

72
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:03,515
Looks like our little guy's
just testing the waters

73
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:06,748
to adjust his game.

74
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:07,582
-Hey.

75
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,815
That twist whatchamacallit?

76
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:13,115
I don't think I'd overuse it.

77
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:15,815
-He said Yuta shouldn't
overuse that twist spin shot.

78
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:18,182
What did Ryoma mean by that?

79
00:06:18,215 --> 00:06:19,148
-Hm.

80
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:20,448
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER):
The twist spin.

81
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:28,648
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Well hot shot.

82
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:31,315
Don't tell me-- you noticed.

83
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:39,415
YUTA (VOICEOVER): Well,
that was a surprise.

84
00:06:43,915 --> 00:06:46,215
-Well, he's really something.

85
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:49,048
Ryoma got the timing
in just a few shots.

86
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:50,715
-The kid's got game.

87
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:51,215
-For sure.

88
00:06:57,415 --> 00:06:58,448
YUTA (VOICEOVER): Come on.

89
00:06:58,482 --> 00:07:01,948
Try and return this.

90
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:05,615
Even if you could return it,
loser, my perfect on the rise

91
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:07,682
shot will smoke
you off the court.

92
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:12,382
Thought so.

93
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,682
He's coming in.

94
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:14,648
Come on!

95
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:25,048
-Wow!

96
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:26,582
Another twist spin shot!

97
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:32,715
-Wow.

98
00:07:32,748 --> 00:07:34,315
Even after I warned you.

99
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:41,115
-What's he doing?

100
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:43,415
If he doesn't slow down,
he'll overrun the hop point.

101
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:47,348
-Slow down!

102
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:49,648
No way you can go for a
sinker on the approach!

103
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:50,848
-Oh, man.

104
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:52,448
He's not going to take
it out of the air, is he?

105
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:53,915
-He loses either way.

106
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:56,582
If he scoots the ball
up, it'll be out.

107
00:07:56,615 --> 00:08:00,515
And if he hits it hard,
he'll put it in the net.

108
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:01,848
-What an idiot.

109
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,182
He must be desperate.

110
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:04,448
YUTA (VOICEOVER): He panicked.

111
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:07,248
No way he can return a
twist spin shot cleanly.

112
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,615
-Still got a ways to go.

113
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:14,082
-Huh?

114
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:16,515
Echizen's not taking
it on the rise.

115
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:21,889
Huh?

116
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:23,889
He's gone!

117
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:25,356
Huh?

118
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:27,656
I can't believe he's
sliding under the ball.

119
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:35,789
-He over hit it.

120
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:37,256
-It's out of the ballpark!

121
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,223
-It's going long.

122
00:08:40,256 --> 00:08:41,756
-You forced it.

123
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,989
-Hitting it hard from that
position, you'll just--

124
00:08:48,156 --> 00:08:48,623
-What?

125
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:52,189
ANNOUNCER: 15-Love.

126
00:08:57,923 --> 00:08:58,956
-What just happened?

127
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:00,056
-What was that shot?

128
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:02,123
-I don't know.

129
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:02,656
-Wow.

130
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:04,778
-A Drive B.

131
00:09:13,773 --> 00:09:14,373
-Wow!

132
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:17,386
Was that for real?

133
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,853
-What just happened?

134
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:22,186
-What was that shot?

135
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,653
-A Drive B.

136
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:27,653
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
A drive volley.

137
00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:29,053
-Tell me something.

138
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:32,153
Was that really a drive volley?

139
00:09:32,186 --> 00:09:32,986
-Sort of.

140
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,175
It wasn't really a normal shot.

141
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:36,775
Looks like Ryoma added a
special touch of momentum.

142
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,675
-A Drive B, huh?

143
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,075
-That's the idea.

144
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:48,842
-The kid can jump and slide.

145
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:49,875
-Great thinking.

146
00:09:49,908 --> 00:09:52,042
With that combination,
he can return

147
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,042
for any low-dipping ball.

148
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:55,808
-A Drive B.

149
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:57,275
-Yeah, a Drive B.

150
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:59,075
-Ryoma made up a new play.

151
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:01,475
BOY: Wow, that seventh
grader is awesome.

152
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:10,608
-I figured out your lefty
killer game plan, tough guy.

153
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:11,842
Now what are you gonna do?

154
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:17,908
YUTA: That kid doesn't mind
an impossible challenge.

155
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:21,242
In fact, he sorta likes it.

156
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:22,608
-Hey.

157
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:26,842
Your brother isn't the only
player out there who's strong.

158
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,242
You're just aiming to beat him.

159
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:32,575
I'm aiming higher.

160
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:44,508
-Hey, kid.

161
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,442
Go ahead and say that
after you beat me.

162
00:10:50,342 --> 00:10:52,242
-OK.

163
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:53,508
BOY: This game's getting wild.

164
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:58,342
Look at that little kid play.

165
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:28,175
ANNOUNCER: Game to Seigaku.

166
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,175
Four games to two.

167
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:36,108
-You rock Ryoma!

168
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:37,608
-Keep it up, Echizen!

169
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:02,508
-So, you're leaving already?

170
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:03,008
-Yeah.

171
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:25,442
-Huh?

172
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:26,542
ANNOUNCER: Game to Seigaku.

173
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:28,308
Five games to four.

174
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:29,575
Change courts.

175
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:31,808
-Ryoma rook back the lead.

176
00:12:31,842 --> 00:12:34,375
-Playing like that, he'll
win the whole match!

177
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:35,575
-Oh yeah.

178
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:37,042
-Go, Ryoma!

179
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:38,042
Go Ryoma!

180
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:42,575
-That rookie's awfully good.

181
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,142
-Yeah.

182
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:47,108
I never thought I'd see Yuta
walked all over like this.

183
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:52,075
And what's weirder, he
seems to be having fun.

184
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:53,942
MIZUKI: You're
getting sloppy, Yuta.

185
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:54,975
I don't like it.

186
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,775
-I'm sorry, Mizuki.

187
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:58,275
-You can still win this.

188
00:12:58,308 --> 00:13:00,242
-Huh?

189
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:02,808
Ah.

190
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:05,142
-Remember back in warm
ups when you practiced

191
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:07,242
hitting at the other guy's face?

192
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:10,175
You know, it's never a
bad idea to take advantage

193
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,875
of your opponent's weaknesses.

194
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:14,042
-Huh?

195
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:15,942
-In district
matches, he was hurt.

196
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:20,608
His left eyelid was cut
with a broken racket.

197
00:13:20,642 --> 00:13:23,342
It's not so easy to forget
something like that.

198
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,408
Even if you think your
brain has dealt with it,

199
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:26,575
your body remembers.

200
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:46,808
Aim for Echizen's left eye.

201
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:47,642
-Huh?

202
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:50,808
-Just go for it, Yuta.

203
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:52,708
Do anything to win.

204
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:55,508
If you lose here, you'll never
be better than your brother.

205
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:13,708
-You've still got
a ways to go yet,

206
00:14:13,742 --> 00:14:16,375
but you've got
lots of potential.

207
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:20,808
I can't believe you're buried
in a place like this, Yuta.

208
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:26,908
-You're looking well.

209
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:28,708
How's it going?

210
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:32,208
-Instead, I'll crush
that seventh grader.

211
00:14:32,242 --> 00:14:34,475
The one who beat Inui.

212
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,875
I'll use everything I've got.

213
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:38,375
That punk's going down.

214
00:14:45,642 --> 00:14:48,042
RYOMA: Your brother isn't
the only player out there

215
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:49,508
who's strong.

216
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:50,975
I'm aiming higher.

217
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:57,575
-I've gotta win.

218
00:15:13,142 --> 00:15:14,108
YUTA: Mizuki.

219
00:15:14,142 --> 00:15:16,142
I'd like to face him head on.

220
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:25,808
-All right.

221
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,742
Not bad.

222
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:30,608
Yeah, they're both having fun!

223
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:32,075
Echizen!

224
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:34,475
You better not lose to that guy!

225
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:36,008
SHUSUKE (VOICEOVER):
Meeting a player

226
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:39,975
who pushes him forces Yuta
to take the next step.

227
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:42,475
Next time you play me,
you'll have improved.

228
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,942
Am I right, Yuta?

229
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:51,908
-I'm not giving up yet.

230
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:53,408
I'll show you!

231
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:55,375
HORIO: A twist spin shot!

232
00:16:07,308 --> 00:16:09,208
ANNOUNCER: 40-15.

233
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:11,075
KATSUO: That was a Drive B.

234
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:11,842
HORIO: Way to go.

235
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:12,475
Echizen.

236
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:13,375
It's match point!

237
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:29,275
SHUSUKE (VOICEOVER): I gotta
say, Echizen's one strange guy.

238
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:31,208
Makes me wanna play him.

239
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:42,742
ANNOUNCER: Game and match
to Seigaku, 6 games to 4!

240
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:44,708
[cheering]

241
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:45,708
BOY: Great job!

242
00:16:45,742 --> 00:16:48,675
You did it, Echizen.

243
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,675
-All right!

244
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,675
He won!

245
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:01,108
-Atta boy, Ryoma!

246
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:04,608
-Way to go, Echizen!

247
00:17:04,642 --> 00:17:07,608
-Well, I lost.

248
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:09,608
You know, you're good.

249
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:11,508
-Could be that you're just lame.

250
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:12,442
-Huh?

251
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:14,342
Why you little--

252
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,475
-I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

253
00:17:20,808 --> 00:17:22,342
-Superb job, little guy.

254
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,342
-That hurts.

255
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,675
-You had us going there.

256
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,008
-Good job, you did it, Ryoma.

257
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:28,875
-Nice game!

258
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:30,408
YUTA (VOICEOVER):
You've got yourself

259
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:32,842
an unbelievable
teammate, big brother.

260
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:41,308
-Excuse me, are you
the team manager?

261
00:17:41,342 --> 00:17:44,608
You should really make Yuta
Fuji stop doing that shot.

262
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:47,508
At his age, his bones
are still forming.

263
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:50,842
If he continues hitting
an extreme shot like that,

264
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,808
then he's likely to
hurt his shoulder.

265
00:17:53,842 --> 00:17:56,442
You know, you really ought
to listen to your elders.

266
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:02,542
-That's none of my concern.

267
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:04,475
Now, was that all you wanted?

268
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:06,075
If so, excuse me.

269
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,842
RYUZAKI (VOICEOVER):
You knew about it.

270
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:17,008
Even Ryoma noticed it
after he faced that shot.

271
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,108
Hajime Mizuki.

272
00:18:19,142 --> 00:18:22,642
How could you care so
little about your teammates?

273
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:26,008
I bet Yuta Fuji doesn't
even know about this.

274
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:33,842
The only ones who know are
Ryoma, Tezuka, and his brother.

275
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:46,208
-Seigaku has two
wins and one loss.

276
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:49,175
If Fuji wins the next match,
they advanced to the quarters!

277
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,008
-It is all in the bag!

278
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:54,542
There's no way that
Fuji's gonna lose.

279
00:18:58,142 --> 00:18:59,808
-Nice game, Yuta.

280
00:18:59,842 --> 00:19:01,742
-Yeah, you played well.

281
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:03,208
-He killed me.

282
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,608
It looks like I've gotta
retrain myself from scratch.

283
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:11,842
I'm sorry, Mizuki.

284
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,475
I tried my best, but I
didn't have enough today.

285
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:19,442
-Takuya, it's time
to get warmed up.

286
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:20,608
-Huh?

287
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:24,575
-You'll be playing Tezuka next.

288
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:27,475
You had better be ready
in time for the match.

289
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:28,142
-Uh, sure.

290
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:34,142
YUTA (VOICEOVER): Mizuki.

291
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:35,542
-Don't worry about it.

292
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,842
He's always hard like
that on guys who lose.

293
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:41,875
-Tezuka.

294
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,342
I know you're ready to play.

295
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:50,875
I'm sorry, but I
really don't think

296
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:52,942
that your turn is
coming up any time soon.

297
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:08,675
ANNOUNCER: We will now
begin the number two singles

298
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,242
match between Fuji of Seigaku
and Mizuki of St. Rudolph.

299
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:14,675
[laughter]

300
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,675
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER): Today's
the last day they'll

301
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,675
call you the genius,
Shusuke Fuji.

302
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:28,550
[theme music]

303
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,017
SHUSUKE: Hi.

304
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,417
This is Shusuke Fuji.

305
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,284
Yuta and Echizen
had a good game.

306
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:03,817
Playing an opponent
that challenges

307
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,617
him will make Yuta stronger.

308
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,017
But Mizuki, you taught
Yuta the twist spin shot

309
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,084
knowing the stress
it puts on his body.

310
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:12,917
I won't forgive you.

311
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,084
You'll pay for
that in our match.

312
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:19,050
Next on "The Prince of Tennis,"
Big Brother Shusuke Fuji.

313
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:20,117
My weaknesses?

314
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,817
I would just love to
know what they are.
