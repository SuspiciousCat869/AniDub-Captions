00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:08,340
-Speed ace.

2
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:09,040
Yeah right!

3
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:14,440
-Ah!

4
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,406
Don't make me laugh.

5
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:20,873
Never underestimate Karukado.

6
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:25,873
Ah!

7
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,873
I will not lose!

8
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:35,840
Huh?

9
00:00:35,873 --> 00:00:38,840
[theme music]

10
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:52,676
[grunt]

11
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,016
-Hey, it went around the net.

12
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,816
That doesn't count as
a legal shot, does it?

13
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,116
[hissing]

14
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,050
-Oh, wow.

15
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:09,983
That rocked.

16
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:11,050
-Sure did.

17
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,950
-Yeah, it curved just
like a boomerang.

18
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:14,483
-A boomerang snake!

19
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:19,416
-Wow, I want to play
games like them.

20
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,816
-Huh?

21
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,750
Huh.

22
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:23,650
Woah.

23
00:02:23,683 --> 00:02:24,716
-Wow.

24
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,983
That was so cool, but
was it even legal?

25
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:29,183
-I'm absolutely sure it is.

26
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,850
The ball goes around the net
post and returns to the court.

27
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:34,850
No rules against it.

28
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:39,916
Even so, I've never seen it
used in a tournament before.

29
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,183
-Look there!

30
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:42,950
It was all a trick
that Kaido had

31
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:44,716
up his sleeve the whole time!

32
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,150
-All right, let's go Kaido!

33
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:49,716
-You know, if he's got
a great trick like that,

34
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,116
then he ought to use
the shot more often.

35
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,883
-Don't sweat.

36
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,683
It's still anybody's game.

37
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,683
ANNOUNCER: Game score.

38
00:02:55,716 --> 00:02:56,116
40-30.

39
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,483
-Haha.

40
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:08,483
Hey.

41
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:10,316
That was a pretty
good trick, Viper.

42
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,283
[hissing]

43
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:17,516
-Now it's my chance
to turn up the heat.

44
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,450
[grunting]

45
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:22,316
-Huh?

46
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,316
Oh!

47
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,550
ANNOUNCER: Game to
Kamio of Fudomine.

48
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,616
One game to love.

49
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,616
[laughter]

50
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,083
-Huh.

51
00:03:29,116 --> 00:03:30,216
Woah.

52
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,350
-The way he served so
quickly was well done.

53
00:03:32,383 --> 00:03:33,850
-How did he do it?

54
00:03:33,883 --> 00:03:36,583
-He did it by keeping
his ball toss low

55
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,816
and then hitting the ball
at an even quicker pace.

56
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,050
Kaido was taken by surprise.

57
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,516
-Huh.

58
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,016
Grr.

59
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:52,950
[hissing]

60
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,416
[grunting]

61
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,116
-That's it!

62
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,816
The boomerang snake shot!

63
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,650
ANNOUNCER: Love-15.

64
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:13,516
-Oh, darn.

65
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,416
He missed it.

66
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,816
-Too bad.

67
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,516
-Awww.

68
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,716
-Ah.

69
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,916
You cut it too close.

70
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,450
-That round-the-pole shot
was just a lucky move.

71
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:22,650
-Sure looks that way.

72
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,116
[grunt]

73
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,383
-I'll stop you
cold with my speed.

74
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,316
[grunt]

75
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,250
-I'm feeling the rhythm.

76
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,783
[grunt]

77
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:43,416
ANNOUNCER: Out.

78
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,816
Love-30.

79
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,616
-Hmm.

80
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,183
-It's no good.

81
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:52,450
-He can't control
his boomerang snake.

82
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:56,383
[grunting]

83
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,350
-Snake!

84
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,816
-Ah!

85
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,283
[panting]

86
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:07,150
ANNOUNCER: Out.

87
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:07,650
Love-40.

88
00:05:09,783 --> 00:05:11,050
KAIDO (VOICEOVER): Man.

89
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:16,450
If I could just execute that
shot, I could beat this guy.

90
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:16,950
-Ahh!

91
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:24,383
ANNOUNCER: Game to
Kamio of Fudomine.

92
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,916
-It's not looking good.

93
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,083
Kaido's not himself.

94
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:27,916
-This is bad.

95
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,816
His snake shot isn't working.

96
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,316
And his boomerang shot
isn't any good either.

97
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:32,850
Oh, no!

98
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,350
[sigh]

99
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,016
-Ah.

100
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,116
-You're trying too hard.

101
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,450
What are you doing?

102
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:47,616
Swinging wildly like that.

103
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,616
This just isn't like you.

104
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,616
It's not your tennis.

105
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,950
You know, you're a
fool to pin your hopes

106
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:56,916
on such a low percentage shot.

107
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:08,916
Kaido.

108
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,283
Just what do you think you're
doing out there on that court?

109
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,350
KAIDO (VOICEOVER): She's right.

110
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:20,816
This-- This isn't
my kind of tennis.

111
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:26,916
-Akira is standing his ground.

112
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,250
That boomerang snake shot made
me nervous there for a while.

113
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:31,350
-Yeah.

114
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:33,516
Looks like Akira's
clearly able to handle it.

115
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,016
-He could walk off with
a love game after all.

116
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,550
-No.

117
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,316
-Huh?

118
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,883
-Kamio's rhythm is off.

119
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:42,083
He's playing much faster
than he usually does.

120
00:06:42,116 --> 00:06:45,716
If he wastes his stamina, the
snake is bound to get him.

121
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,216
-Oh.

122
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:01,750
-Kind of makes me wonder.

123
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:03,616
Is Kaido all right?

124
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,616
-I wonder where Sakuno is?

125
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,150
-Oh, yeah.

126
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:06,716
You're right.

127
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,516
Where'd she go?

128
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,283
-I think to the girls' room.

129
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:12,783
-I'd better hurry The
match is starting.

130
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:13,750
Oh.

131
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:16,350
Looks like I'm totally lost.

132
00:07:16,383 --> 00:07:17,416
Where were those courts?

133
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,816
Oh.

134
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,716
[grunt]

135
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,316
-Get off!

136
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,616
-Oh!

137
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,516
I'm so sorry.

138
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,083
I wasn't looking.

139
00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:26,416
-What's that?

140
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,116
You step on my shoes and think
"I'm sorry" can fix that?

141
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,616
Huh?

142
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,816
KAMIO (VOICEOVER):
You're stubborn, Viper.

143
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,750
You have no chance of winning.

144
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:52,050
You must be getting tired.

145
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,450
Well, this is it.

146
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:56,016
[growling]

147
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,816
-Well, it looks like he's
found himself after all.

148
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,916
--I know.

149
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,516
But it still looks like
Kaido's in trouble.

150
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,050
-It looks like it's not
going to end simply.

151
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:09,950
When Kaido gets cornered,
he gets really dangerous.

152
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,783
[grunting]

153
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,183
-Sure is tight.

154
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:22,616
Kamio is quick, but
Kaido sure is tough.

155
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,750
-If he keeps going like that,
Kaido might just catch up.

156
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:30,583
ANNOUNCER: 40-30.

157
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:32,350
-Oh, it's match point.

158
00:08:32,383 --> 00:08:35,150
That service break he lost
before has totally hurt him.

159
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:37,616
-If he drops the next
point, he's lost.

160
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,450
-Come on, Kaido.

161
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:39,016
You can do it.

162
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,883
Hang in there.

163
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,683
KAMIO (VOICEOVER): I've never
played anyone so tenacious.

164
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:46,616
You've done well, Viper.

165
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,950
But this is the end.

166
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,016
[grunt]

167
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,750
-No, look out, Kaido!

00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:56,250

00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,051
-Oh no.

171
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:09,261
It's a quick stroke!

00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:13,701
[grunting]

173
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:18,607
-Ugh.

00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,741

-He stood his ground!

179
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:26,110
-Nice job, Kaido.

180
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:27,877
-Hey, Momoshiro.

181
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,344
-Hey, what's happening?

182
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:30,947
How's Tonka's arm?

183
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,080
-Ha.

184
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,237
He's still at the
hospital, but don't worry,

185
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,070
our boy is really tough.

186
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:36,670
-He's still at the hospital?

187
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:37,737
All right.

188
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,770
I'm out of here.

189
00:09:38,804 --> 00:09:40,304
-Wait a second, Momoshiro.

190
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:41,970
How's the game so far?

191
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:42,670
-Oh.

192
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:44,770
You should check it out.

193
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:47,337
-You should really watch
where you're going, kid.

194
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,904
-Um, I'm sorry.

195
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:51,370
-I bet you think it's
no big deal that you

196
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:52,937
stepped on my brand new shoes.

197
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,170
They're a one-of-a-kind
pair, you know.

198
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:59,770
I kept them clean through all
my matches and you ruined them.

199
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:01,204
Don't you get it, kid?

200
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:03,637
-But what can I do?

201
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,404
-Just give me 30,000 yen.

202
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:07,937
-H-- how much?

203
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,137
-You heard me.

204
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,670
$30,000 yen.

205
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:12,670
-Shut up, jerk.

206
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:13,770
-Huh?

207
00:10:13,804 --> 00:10:16,504
-You know, extortion
is such an ugly word.

208
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:17,404
She apologized.

209
00:10:17,437 --> 00:10:20,004
Just leave her alone.

210
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,037
-And who are you supposed to be?

211
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,837
-Just a good citizen.

212
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,870
Let's go.

213
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:26,704
I think it's time
we got out of here.

214
00:10:26,737 --> 00:10:28,170
-But-- he said--

215
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:28,837
-Hey, wait.

216
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,570
I'm not done.

217
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:30,904
[gasp]

218
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:33,237
-From now on, why don't you
mind your own business, OK?

219
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,437
ANNOUNCER: Advantage, server.

220
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,404
-This is it.

221
00:10:44,537 --> 00:10:45,770
ANNOUNCER: Deuce again.

222
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:47,570
[hissing]

223
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:48,737
-Saved another one.

224
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,904
-What a game!

225
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:50,770
-Come on, Kaido.

226
00:10:50,804 --> 00:10:51,604
Let's do it.

227
00:10:51,637 --> 00:10:53,904
-This is your moment, Kaido.

228
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:55,237
You can do it.

229
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,037
-Hmm.

230
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,404
KAMIO (VOICEOVER) Hurry up.

231
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:01,070
And fold!

232
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:04,270
-Who's going to fold?

233
00:11:04,304 --> 00:11:04,937
-Oh, no.

234
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,770
Another snake shot!

235
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:09,237
[grunting]

236
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,470
-Unbelievable!

237
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:17,404
He's so determined!

238
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:21,537
He's running so hard, but
he's still not out of breath.

239
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,070
-They've both been burning
up the same amount of energy,

240
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:30,237
but-- Kaido runs 10
kilometers in the morning.

241
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,037
10 kilometers after practice.

242
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,204
And 10 at night.

243
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:38,504
He does three sets of dashes
and that's just to start.

244
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:39,037
-What?

245
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,070
That's nuts.

246
00:11:40,104 --> 00:11:42,670
He couldn't possibly
do that every day.

247
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:43,704
-Bingo.

248
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:45,770
That's three times
our regular routine.

249
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:54,004
-So you want stamina like
no one else in the league?

250
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:55,870
-Hmm.

251
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:58,204
-Then you should really
try this regimen.

252
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:04,437
-I will do double that.

253
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,737
-Kaido is incredible.

254
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,237
-Yeah.

255
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,070
ANNOUNCER: Net ball
makes it deuce again.

256
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:20,004
-Bad shot.

257
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:23,537
That sure doesn't
seem like Kaido.

258
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,337
KAMIO (VOICEOVER):
He's hanging tough.

259
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,637
Got to admire that spirit.

260
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,904
It's clear that the usual
offense won't work this time.

261
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:31,570
In that case--

262
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:35,304
-Take that.

263
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,137
---I'll step up the rhythm.

264
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,070
-Speed looks good, Kamio.

265
00:12:41,104 --> 00:12:44,404
[grunting]

266
00:12:44,437 --> 00:12:46,337
-Woah!

267
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,737
-Oh, no.

268
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,970
How could you hit your toughest
snake shot at a time like this?

269
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,970
[grunting]

270
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:06,404
-Hahaha.

271
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:08,137
Sorry about that, pal.

272
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,904
Guess it all comes down to luck.

273
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,204
Huh?

274
00:13:17,237 --> 00:13:22,504
[grunt]

275
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:24,504
ANNOUNCER: Advantage, Kaido.

276
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,404
-I will not lose.

277
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:33,104
Who said it was over?

278
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:35,537
I don't care if
it's match point.

279
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,337
Watch out.

280
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,470
I will never, ever give up.

281
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:43,804
-Oh, man, he's stubborn.

282
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:46,770
-Slowly eating away
at an opponent.

283
00:13:46,804 --> 00:13:49,704
Even if the player's ahead,
he can't help but feel

284
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,704
the pressure.

285
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:54,170
-Isn't it just like
him to fight like this.

286
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,704
[gasps]

287
00:14:07,537 --> 00:14:10,504
[grunting]

288
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:17,804
-Ahhh!

289
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,504
ANNOUNCER: Game and match.

290
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,137
Kaido of Seigaku.

291
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,837
Seven games to five.

292
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,804
-All right.

293
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:36,770
We won the match!

294
00:14:36,804 --> 00:14:39,704
[cheering]

295
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:51,470
-Oh, man.

296
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:53,637
I can't believe I
let the team down.

297
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,237
-He was a tough player.

298
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,204
-I did the best I could,
so I have no regrets.

299
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:02,837
But you know, the next two
matches will be much harder.

300
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,637
-Don't worry about it.

301
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,237
Just go ahead and
leave the rest to us.

302
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,904
Right, Shinji?

303
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,670
-Stay out of it.

304
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:16,637
-Oh!

305
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,504
-How dare you?

306
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:19,304
-Shut up and get lost, will you?

307
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:20,770
-What school are you from?

308
00:15:20,804 --> 00:15:23,704
Do you always go around
beating up on girls like that?

309
00:15:23,737 --> 00:15:25,904
-Do you always go around
looking for fights?

310
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:26,737
-Please, stop that.

311
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,637
Please stop.

312
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,670
-Bad idea beating up girls.

313
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:31,037
Really bad.

314
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,670
You idiot.

315
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:33,804
-Huh?

316
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:36,370
Oh!

317
00:15:36,404 --> 00:15:37,337
-Oh!

318
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,037
-Yes!

319
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,370
That felt great.

320
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:41,737
Loser.

321
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,404
-Why, you--

322
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:43,370
-Momoshiro.

323
00:15:43,404 --> 00:15:44,304
-That's me.

324
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:46,137
-This punk demanded money.

325
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,770
30,000 yen because she
stepped on his shoe.

326
00:15:48,804 --> 00:15:51,870
-Well now, you'll just have
to throw them in the washer.

327
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:54,437
Just like everybody else does.

328
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,404
-And who are you?

329
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:58,537
-Momoshiro of Seigaku.

330
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,070
[growling]

331
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:03,437
-Shall I step on the other one?

332
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,637
-I'll get you for this!

333
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,204
-Come back, punk.

334
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:08,904
You didn't even
tell us your name.

335
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:10,770
-You saved us, Momoshiro.

336
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,804
-I can never thank you enough.

337
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:15,370
I'm just so sorry I
caused all this trouble.

338
00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:16,937
-It's no big deal.

339
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,070
Oh, yeah.

340
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:20,570
You were the one looking
for Echizen that time.

341
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,370
-Oh, yeah.

342
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:22,470
That was me.

343
00:16:22,504 --> 00:16:23,737
-I get it.

344
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,004
You guys are here
to cheer him on.

345
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:28,337
Awww, puppy love.

346
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,304
Well, you better hurry
up and get going,

347
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:32,137
or the match will
begin without you.

348
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,237
-Aren't you going?

349
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,337
-No.

350
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,204
Actually, I've got to
go to the hospital.

351
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:37,337
-Are you all right?

352
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,404
How badly are you
hurt, Momoshiro?

353
00:16:39,437 --> 00:16:40,204
-No, no.

354
00:16:40,237 --> 00:16:41,470
It isn't me.

355
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:42,304
It's Taka Kawamura.

356
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:43,670
Mura.

357
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:47,070
His opponent from Fudomine
hit this awesome ball

358
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:48,304
in the finals.

359
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:50,770
He managed to return the
ball, but he hurt his wrist

360
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:52,270
while doing it.

361
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:55,637
-You mean Kawamura who
returned Ashida's power drive?

362
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,437
Wow, what an amazing feat.

363
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,337
He must be good.

364
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,104
-You know a lot.

365
00:17:00,137 --> 00:17:02,804
-Well, that's because I'm
a student at Fudomine.

366
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:03,704
-Oh.

367
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:05,304
That explains it.

368
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:08,004
You have a good
team, for a rival.

369
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:11,904
In fact, your captain,
Tachibane, is especially good.

370
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:15,370
He's definitely not your
average everyday player.

371
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:18,670
I really want to play that
tough guy in number one singles

372
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,937
and do my signature dunk
smash, just like this.

373
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,937
See?

374
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,537
-I'm not sure about
that, Momoshiro.

375
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,770
-Huh?

376
00:17:25,804 --> 00:17:26,770
-Your dunk smash.

377
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:28,670
It's not junior-high level.

378
00:17:28,704 --> 00:17:30,637
It's better than that, for sure.

379
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,137
I don't think anyone
can return that shot.

380
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,870
MOMOSHIRO (VOICEOVER)
She's well informed.

381
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:37,170
-But if you go up
against my brother,

382
00:17:37,204 --> 00:17:39,470
he'll never even
give you a chance.

383
00:17:39,504 --> 00:17:40,370
-Huh?

384
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:40,870
-What?

385
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:41,670
Brother?

386
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:42,537
You don't mean--

387
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,770
-Haha.

388
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:47,804
I'm tough-guy Tachibana's
little sister, An.

389
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:48,304
-Huh?

390
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:55,404
-Hey.

391
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:57,204
I understand now.

392
00:17:57,237 --> 00:18:01,037
I finally broke down the way you
hit the boomerang snake shot.

393
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,137
It's really not too hard.

394
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,937
How about you and
I try it later?

395
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,637
-You sure you want to do that?

396
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,470
It's just going to
give you more enemies

397
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:11,504
during the ranking
matches, you know.

398
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:12,604
-Don't care.

399
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:15,337
I've already started
collecting more data.

400
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,004
Don't worry.

401
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:18,137
I'll still beat you.

402
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,770
-I will make you eat your words.

403
00:18:22,337 --> 00:18:23,104
-Hey, look.

404
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:25,770
The match is starting.

405
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,870
-The first to win
three games wins.

406
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:31,170
If you take this game, Echizen,
you win the tournament.

407
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:32,204
Go for it!

408
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:36,137
-Come on, Ryoma.

409
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,970
You can do it.

410
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:39,737
-I can't wait to see Ryoma.

411
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,337
It's his big debut
as a singles player.

412
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,504
-Don't just stare at him.

413
00:18:43,537 --> 00:18:44,304
Take some pictures.

414
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:45,170
-Oh, yeah.

415
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:47,504
Right.

416
00:18:47,537 --> 00:18:49,437
-Shinji Ibu of Fudomine.

417
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,504
He's the one who didn't let that
seeded player Kuki get close,

418
00:18:52,537 --> 00:18:53,670
right?

419
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:55,937
-Seigaku put a seventh
grader in that key number

420
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,004
two singles slot.

421
00:18:57,037 --> 00:18:58,770
I don't get it.

422
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,570
-I feel kind of sorry for him.

423
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:01,937
Maybe it's a throwaway match.

424
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:24,004
ANNOUNCER: One set match.

425
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,604
Seigaku's Echizen to serve.

426
00:19:36,904 --> 00:19:38,370
-He's using his right hand.

427
00:19:38,404 --> 00:19:40,070
He's giving it all he's got.

428
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:43,037
-Hmm.

429
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,537
-Oh!

430
00:19:46,504 --> 00:19:49,304
-Son of Nonjiro Echizen.

431
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:51,037
Knock their socks off.

432
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,637
[grunt]

433
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,655
[theme music]

434
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:02,998
-Are you all here?

435
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:05,532
I'm Sunida Reuzake.

436
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:08,598
That Ibo of Fudomine
is quite a player.

437
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:12,132
He's spoiling Ryoma's
specialty, the kick serve.

438
00:21:12,165 --> 00:21:16,432
When I look at Ryoma,
I remember the old days

439
00:21:16,465 --> 00:21:18,265
when Nanjuro was young.

440
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:19,265
Come on, Ryoma.

441
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:22,432
Go knock everyone's socks off.

442
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:24,932
Next on The Prince of
Tennis-- The Love Letter.

443
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:28,465
What in the world is that about?
