00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:23,643
JUDGE: Game to St. Rudolph.

2
00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:25,776
That makes two games to love.

3
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,576
St. Rudolph leads.

4
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,543
-They broke the golden pair.

5
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:31,476
On their serve.

6
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,443
Yikes.

7
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:36,376
-What's the big surprise?

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,643
It's all part of the plan.

9
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:49,076
-Awesome.

10
00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:56,410
-Now's my chance.

11
00:00:56,443 --> 00:00:59,976
Kikumaru, you're through.

12
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,976
[theme music]

13
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,966
-Kikumaru, you're through.

14
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:20,766
-I don't think so.

15
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,566
-It's Oishi.

16
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,633
-Oishi?

17
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:28,033
-Too bad, Akazawa,
'cuz this is doubles.

18
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:28,933
-Here goes.

19
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:31,400
Oishi's best shot.

20
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:32,466
Absolute control.

21
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,400
He'll aim his shot
right over his opponent.

22
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:36,366
The top spin volley.

23
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:50,333
-Oh no, the-- the moon
volley heading near the line.

24
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:52,833
-No way.

25
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:54,400
That's not right.

26
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:56,633
Oishi didn't aim near the line.

27
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,933
-What?

28
00:02:57,966 --> 00:03:01,066
-He aimed right at the line.

29
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,866
-Amazing.

30
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,800
They're even more gold than now.

31
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,300
-And I thought it
was over for sure.

32
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,200
-Oishi is just smoking hot.

33
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:09,733
Yeah.

34
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,700
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER): Oishi.

35
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:25,100
JUDGE: 30 all.

36
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,533
-Eiji has regained
his confidence.

37
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:30,633
He's moving very well, and
he's watching his opponent.

38
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:40,666
With perfect timing,
Oishi's special shot

39
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,366
confuses his opponents.

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,933
JUDGE: 30-40.

41
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,566
-Yeah.

42
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,133
-Eiji, Seigaku, two games all.

43
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,966
-How amazing.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,600
-We caught up to them.

45
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:08,066
-Oishi may be a quiet player,
but he carries a big racket.

46
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,400
-We're not called the
golden pair for nothing.

47
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:11,900
Eiji?

48
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,366
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Queit player indeed.

49
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,233
He bides his time and
waits for his opportunities

50
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:25,266
using the smallest of
openings to his advantage.

51
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,566
It's disgusting.

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,733
I thought Kikumaru would
fall with our strategy,

53
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:33,266
but they're much tighter
as a team than I expected.

54
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,033
I specifically warned them
about Oishi's moon volley.

55
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:42,033
Ah, that fool Akazawa.

56
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:45,433
JUDGE: Service to
Seigaku's Oishi.

57
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:48,800
[crowd cheering]

58
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,500
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
He has uncanny timing

59
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,200
and picks the worst spots.

60
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:59,500
I guess I won't be able
to use just one strategy.

61
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,566
AKAZAWA (VOICEOVER):
Shoot, I completely forgot

62
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,433
all about Mizuki's warnings.

63
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:07,733
-Kaneda, try to
aim behind Oishi.

64
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,166
What's wrong, Kaneda?

65
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,466
-Captain, look at that.

66
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,466
-Go, Seigaku.

67
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,600
-Look at that formation.

68
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,166
They're both standing at
the center of the court.

69
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:36,033
BOY 1: Here it goes.

70
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:38,133
BOY 2: Hey, both sides of
the court are wide open.

71
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,600
BOY 1: He can choose
their returns.

72
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,066
AKAZAWA (VOICEOVER):
Some strategy.

73
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,100
They're up to something.

74
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:48,033
He moved after all.

75
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:51,866
Then I'll go opposite.

76
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,633
BOY 3: Oishi.

77
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,433
BOY 2: There it is, moon volley.

78
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:00,133
JUDGE: 15 love.

79
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,033
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
That formation.

80
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:05,233
It's not possible.

81
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:07,900
-Could it have been
Australian formation?

82
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,466
-Hey, what was that all about?

83
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,600
-It's a very
unorthodox formation

84
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:15,066
that's known as the
Australian formation.

85
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,333
It's uncommon with both players
lined up along the center.

86
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:20,600
They move left or
right after the serve,

87
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:23,066
but since it's uncertain
which side they'll be on,

88
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,600
it wears out the receiver
on the opponent's end.

89
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:27,833
His difficulty lies in
reading and reacting

90
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:30,433
to where Oishi and
Kikumaru will go.

91
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,466
Until now, Rudolph has
been playing according

92
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,166
to scouted data reports, but
now they'll have to guess.

93
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,933
This strategy will work.

94
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:38,033
There's a risk.

95
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:39,933
Unless the two partners
are totally in sync

96
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,600
with one another,
it leaves the court

97
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:43,866
wide open for their
opponents to hit.

98
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,600
-Wow, leave it to
Seigaku's golden pair

99
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,900
to be able to play such
an unusual formation.

100
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:56,666
No, no, Kikumaru,
it's not like that.

101
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,233
-It's too hard.

102
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:00,433
This whatchamacallit formation.

103
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:02,633
-It's called the
Australian formation.

104
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,733
Unless you to are in sync,
this will have no impact.

105
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:09,200
That means not only Oishi
but you too, Kikumaru.

106
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:11,566
In order for you to
win, the both of you

107
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,266
must be attuned to
each other's moves.

108
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,566
Once you master it,
you'll have your opponents

109
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
on the edge of confusion.

110
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,966
-Oh, well, I know I'll
figure it out somehow.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,566
-Yes, yes.

112
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,700
They always play the
real match as well.

113
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,533
AKAZAWA (VOICEOVER):
If this were singles,

114
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:36,166
they'd be easy to deal with.

115
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,466
Here we go again.

116
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,666
Kikumaru will move and
Oishi will take a shot.

117
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,933
But no matter how many
times they use it,

118
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:57,666
I'll figure it out.

119
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,600
So which side?

120
00:07:58,633 --> 00:07:59,900
Left or right?

121
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:16,366
I can't figure it out.

122
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,866
Whatever.

123
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,466
I hit it short.

124
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,566
JUDGE: Net.

125
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,000
30 love.

126
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:26,700
AKAZAWA (VOICEOVER):
They've got me.

127
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:29,066
They're aiming at me.

128
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,566
-Ahhh!

129
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,133
AKAZAWA (VOICEOVER): As if I'd
let them play around with me.

130
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,566
-Boy, that was a shock.

131
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,933
-What's with that guy anyway?

132
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:03,800
AKAZAWA (VOICEOVER): Now
then, what can I possibly do.

133
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,233
Those two are in
the Nationals class.

134
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:09,800
How can I play against
that troublesome formation?

135
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:13,466
There wasn't anything
like it in Mizuki's data.

136
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,866
-The tricky thing about
playing the golden pair

137
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,533
is the switch overs
between Kikumaru and Oishi

138
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:20,633
that occur sometimes
during the match.

139
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:24,433
You must take care and
destroy Kikumaru before that.

140
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:25,633
AKAZAWA (VOICEOVER): Destroy.

141
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,066
Destroy.

142
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,000
Destroy.

143
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,433
-If this were singles, I'd
have taken care of him.

144
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:33,333
I must find a way
to break their flow

145
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,333
of concentration and quickly.

146
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:42,033
-Captain, I've been
doing some thinking.

147
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,200
I've come up with an idea.

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,366
-Stay out of this.

149
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,133
-I'm sorry, but I need to say
this if only for your own sake.

150
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:58,533
Akazawa, you idiot!

151
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,266
They're playing doubles tennis.

152
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,166
This is not a singles match.

153
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,633
Don't you get it, you fool?

154
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,633
-Um, what?

155
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,500
What was all that
about, Kaneda, huh?

156
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,500
-Akazawa, forgive me.

157
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,933
-Who do you think
you're talking to?

158
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:20,366
-Looks like the St. Rudolph
pair are fighting each other.

159
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,966
-Really weird.

160
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,700
-Listen to me,
Akazawa, there using

161
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:33,033
the Australian
formation against us.

162
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,266
-Australian?

163
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,233
-Yeah, I read about
it once in a book.

164
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:44,333
-It's coming.

165
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:45,566
Which side should
I hit this time?

166
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,833
-I just don't know.

167
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:49,633
It's impossible to know
where those two will go next.

168
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,766
But considering what
they've been doing earlier

169
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,233
in this match, I've
developed a theory.

170
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:56,100
In this formation,
a Kikumaru moves

171
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,966
to the left or right
which each serve,

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,700
Oishi must rush forward
in the opposite direction.

173
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:01,866
In that case--

174
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,666
-He's getting back on the court.

175
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:11,500
-There, weak spot.

176
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:12,566
It's right there!

177
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:20,000
JUDGE: Out.

178
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:21,600
40 love.

179
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:24,233
OISHI (VOICEOVER):
He took a step back.

180
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,066
-Oishi.

181
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,800
-Yeah, I saw it.

182
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,833
He read my lob.

183
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,200
It could mean trouble.

184
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:29,400
-I'm so sorry.

185
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:31,566
I talked big and I thought
I knew what I was doing,

186
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,466
but now I've messed things up.

187
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,833
Big time.

188
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,600
OISHI (VOICEOVER): I didn't
expect them to be that sharp.

189
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:41,200
-Oishi, you know, you guys may
be great at playing doubles,

190
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,766
but things are
different now than we

191
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,133
have a player who
thinks just like you do.

192
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:02,233
-Huh?

193
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:03,566
Where'd Ryoma go?

194
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,066
Ryoma?

195
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,353
JUDGE: Out.

196
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:18,953
40 love.

197
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:21,553
OISHI (VOICEOVER):
He took a step back.

198
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:22,120
-Oishi.

199
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:23,220
-Yeah, I saw.

200
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:23,953
He read my lob.

201
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,553
It could mean trouble.

202
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:26,786
-I'm so sorry.

203
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,220
I talked big, and I thought
I knew what I was doing,

204
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:30,486
but now I've missed things up.

205
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,853
Big time.

206
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:33,620
OISHI (VOICEOVER): I didn't
expect them to be that sharp.

207
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:38,786
-Oishi, you know, you guys may
be great at playing doubles,

208
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,286
but things are
different now that we

209
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,986
have a player who
thinks just like you do.

210
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,186
OISHI (VOICEOVER): A
school like St. Rudolph

211
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,653
has a lot of talented
reserves in its ranks.

212
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:58,086
But Akazawa and Kaneda
have been with the program

213
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,586
from the start.

214
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,486
The upperclassman
and the junior.

215
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,953
Kaneda's practiced
hard behind Akazawa

216
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,920
and the results
speak for themselves.

217
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:13,753
[crowd cheering]

218
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:18,320
-Hey, Kaneda.

219
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:19,053
-Yes, Captain.

220
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,953
-I'm gonna hit a
lob, so help me out.

221
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:27,820
-Uh, sure.

222
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:33,820
-It seems like it's
crunch time, Oishi.

223
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:36,953
-So it seems.

224
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:39,686
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Akazawa, Kaneda, now

225
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,820
it's time for you to
show your great will.

226
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:52,286
JUDGE: Game to St. Rudolph.

227
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,786
Three games to two.

228
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,920
St. Rudolph leads.

229
00:13:55,953 --> 00:13:58,586
-Oh, now we're losing again.

230
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,086
-The St. Rudolph players
are picking up steam

231
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,486
and gaining momentum.

232
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,153
They make a good
combination together.

233
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:07,920
JUDGE: Change sides.

234
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:09,820
[crowd cheering]

235
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,486
-Eiji, you'll feel better
off if you take some liquids.

236
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,020
Eiji?

237
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,053
Oh, found it.

238
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:38,853
Here, for energy.

239
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,320
-I wonder if everything's
going to be OK.

240
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:46,520
-Of course, of course.

241
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,620
No way they'd lose an
important match like this.

242
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:49,920
-I wonder.

243
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:52,886
Eiji's energy was completely
sapped in the first half.

244
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,886
It's almost certain to
influence the rest of the game.

245
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:01,586
BOY 2: The blur shot.

246
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,220
-Players to the court.

247
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:06,453
-Let's win this, Captain.

248
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:07,786
-Yeah.

249
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,653
AKAZAWA (VOICEOVER): According
to Mizuki's data reports,

250
00:15:09,686 --> 00:15:13,820
he predicted a tight game,
but I won't let that happen.

251
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:15,753
It's time for us to beat them.

252
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,020
JUDGE: Seigaku, get
on the court together.

253
00:15:25,953 --> 00:15:26,420
-Eiji.

254
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:34,686
-Hm.

255
00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:42,820
-What's with Kikumaru?

256
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:44,586
-What'll we do?

257
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,820
-Hey, Ryoma?

258
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:46,986
Hey, he's not here.

259
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:56,820
-Eiji?

260
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:05,920
-Kikumaru looks
totally exhausted.

261
00:16:05,953 --> 00:16:07,253
-You right, Shiba.

262
00:16:07,286 --> 00:16:09,653
Seems like Akazawa's blur
shot has really warn him out,

263
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:11,386
and that's not the only thing.

264
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,353
On top of that, this
long game has really

265
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:14,420
taken its toll on him.

266
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,720
-Ah, it's so hot.

267
00:16:29,753 --> 00:16:33,353
-Hey, should you be
dosing off like that?

268
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:34,186
Ryoma Echizen?

269
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:37,920
-Not really.

270
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,153
-Listen to this guy, would ya?

271
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:40,253
I can't believe it.

272
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:42,620
He's as cocky as ever
and still an idiot.

273
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,553
-So is the game over yet?

274
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,653
-Not quite yet.

275
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:46,986
-Not yet?

276
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,020
How can they still be playing
unless something's wrong?

277
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:50,853
-Captain, you gotta see this.

278
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:52,053
It's unbelievable.

279
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:54,953
The Seigaku doubles team
is losing six to five.

280
00:16:54,986 --> 00:16:57,586
-You mean that feisty
Oishi Kikumaru pair?

281
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,786
-Seigaku.

282
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,253
Seigaku.

283
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:04,720
Seigaku.

284
00:17:04,753 --> 00:17:05,220
Seigaku.

285
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:13,586
MIZUKI (VOICEOVER): That's it.

286
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,586
His legs won't carry
him any farther.

287
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,586
Too bad, Kikumaru.

288
00:17:28,353 --> 00:17:29,786
BOY 2: Oishi's amazing.

289
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,020
He's covering the
court all by himself.

290
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,553
BOY 3: That's because he has to.

291
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,020
Kikumaru's not even moving.

292
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,986
ALL: Hang in there, Oishi.

293
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,786
-Well, they hung in there
longer than I calculated.

294
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:44,853
JUDGE: 40 love.

295
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,386
[crowd chanting]

296
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,820
KANEDA VOICEOVER): I
admire your determination

297
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:21,420
to come back from
behind, Oishi, even when

298
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:23,186
outnumbered two to one.

299
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,053
But that's why I
want to beat you.

300
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:27,920
-It's a drop volley.

301
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,386
-Leave it to Oishi,
he knew it was coming.

302
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,086
Look out!

303
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,486
That was a trap, Oishi.

304
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,586
Now, they've got you.

305
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:43,453
OISHI (VOICEOVER): Curses.

306
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,220
ALL: A jumping smash!

307
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:50,120
-It's over, Oishi.

308
00:18:50,153 --> 00:18:50,586
-Oh.

309
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,620
-Gotta hurry.

310
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
[crowd cheering]

311
00:19:23,753 --> 00:19:24,253
JUDGE: 40-15.

312
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,753
-Here we go.

313
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:35,086
-I can't believe he did that.

314
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:45,953
-Oishi, I'm as good as new.

315
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:47,253
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

316
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:51,320
GIRL IN CROWD: Kikumaru.

317
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:52,786
Kikumaru.

318
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,786
-Hey there.

319
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,253
-I can't believe he recovered.

320
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:57,686
That's too bad.

321
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,153
I'd thought for sure they'd have
to give up a game over this.

322
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:08,020
-I wasn't sure you'd be
able to help me in time.

323
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:10,353
All right, now, time
to finish this match.

324
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,156
[theme music]

325
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:01,256
-I'm Yoshiro Akazawa, captain
of the St. Rudolph tennis team.

326
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:03,823
Kikumaru and Oishi
are my arch rivals.

327
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:07,956
To be honest, I never expected
Kikumaru to recover like that.

328
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:11,156
No wonder they're the
golden pair of Seigaku.

329
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:13,623
Mizuki's scenario won't
work against them,

330
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:15,156
but we won't give up.

331
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:17,156
And we'll leave them
lying on the court.

332
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:20,689
Next on the "Prince of
Tennis, the Tiebreak."

333
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:23,323
Kaneda, don't give up.
