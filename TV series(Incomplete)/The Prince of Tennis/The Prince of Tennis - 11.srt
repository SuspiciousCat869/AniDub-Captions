1
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:09,694
-I'm gonna get that
third singles spot.

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,794
-Wait a minute.

3
00:00:10,828 --> 00:00:12,428
You got your eye on
that singles spot, too?

4
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:14,694
-I'm not much of
a doubles player.

5
00:00:14,728 --> 00:00:17,028
Coach makes the decision
on that one, right?

6
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:19,194
-She never says until
the last minute,

7
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:22,094
right before we're ready
to go on the court.

8
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:25,428
RYOMA: Well then, should
we settle it ourselves?

9
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:26,461
MOMOSHIRO: Good idea.

10
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:27,794
Let's go.

11
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:31,294
[music playing]

12
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:44,710
[music playing]

13
00:01:54,243 --> 00:01:54,910
-Later you guys.

14
00:01:54,943 --> 00:01:55,810
-All right, then.

15
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:56,510
See you tomorrow.

16
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:03,043
Finally, the district
prelims start in two days.

17
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:05,210
To advance to the
metropolitan matches,

18
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:08,743
we have to take either first
or second place, right?

19
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:10,076
-First or second?

20
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,076
-Oh, don't worry, you dim bulbs.

21
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,676
You know our regulars are gonna
trash everybody else for sure.

22
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,243
Besides, our team is
the number one seed.

23
00:02:19,276 --> 00:02:20,376
KACHIRO: That's right.

24
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,976
Three singles and
two doubles matches.

25
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,643
I wonder which
Ryoma will play in.

26
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:29,143
-Well, Echizen's not
the cooperative type.

27
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:31,776
I can't really see him
playing doubles at all.

28
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,576
I mean, the guy
is way too moody.

29
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,710
-Stop that!

30
00:02:34,743 --> 00:02:37,510
Don't you dare say
anything mean about Ryoma!

31
00:02:37,543 --> 00:02:38,376
-It's Tomoka.

32
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,876
-You scared me to death.

33
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,576
This is the boys'
locker room, you know.

34
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,810
-So what?

35
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:44,843
It's your own fault for
leaving the door wide open.

36
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:46,310
-Hey, Tomoka.

37
00:02:46,343 --> 00:02:47,743
-So, where's Ryoma?

38
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:48,443
Huh?

39
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:49,676
-Oh, he's already gone.

40
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,476
-He left?

41
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,676
What about practice?

42
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,376
-You know we already played
for our team rankings.

43
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,776
That means no practice.

44
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,743
TOMOKA: What?

45
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:58,243
No way!

46
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:04,376
I can't believe they
cancelled practice.

47
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,010
I was gonna cheer
for Ryoma, too.

48
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:08,743
SAKUNO: There's always tomorrow

49
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:10,310
TOMOKA: Tomorrow's no good.

50
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:12,743
The district team matches
start the day after.

51
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,810
It'll be totally,
completely different.

52
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:16,943
-Why so different?

53
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:18,643
TOMOKA: "District prelims
start in two days.

54
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:19,976
Go for it, Ryoma!"

55
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,110
See?

56
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:22,610
-Yikes.

57
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:23,476
And tomorrow?

58
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,543
-It says, "fight, Ryoma.

59
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:25,976
It's your day."

60
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,943
What a bummer!

61
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:29,610
I worked so hard on these.

62
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,810
I stayed up past my
bedtime and everything.

63
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:33,876
-Cheer up, Tomoka.

64
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,143
I'll buy you a soda.

65
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:38,710
-That's OK.

66
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:39,876
It's no use.

67
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,843
And soda can't
possibly cheer me up.

68
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:44,543
-Hmm.

69
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:47,610
Let me think.

70
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:52,176
And after I said that, the
news spread like crazy.

71
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,443
Now a bunch of girls want
to join Ryoma's fan club.

72
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:59,176
As president of
the fan club, I'm

73
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,443
thrilled to welcome
anyone who wants to join.

74
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:04,410
And I'm going to sign up every
single girl in seventh grade.

75
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:05,376
So what do you think?

76
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,576
Pretty cool, huh?

77
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,476
-Huh?

78
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,443
Look, it's him-- Ryoma.

79
00:04:09,476 --> 00:04:11,376
-I can't believe it.

80
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:11,943
Whoa!

81
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:13,343
MOMOSHIRO: Hey.

82
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:15,276
-Oh, hi, Momo.

83
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,310
-Hey, Echizen.

84
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:18,476
-Momoshiro's here too?

85
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,476
-So what exactly are
you doing in here?

86
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,676
-I'm getting a cheeseburger.

87
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,210
What do you think I'm doing?

88
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:25,510
-Eating junk food, are you?

89
00:04:25,543 --> 00:04:28,643
-Aren't you guys on the
Seigaku tennis team?

90
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:29,343
-Yeah.

91
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:30,610
Yeah we are.

92
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:33,110
-Is it really true the
positions are set for the match?

93
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:34,243
It must be.

94
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:36,343
Are you guys regulars?

95
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,310
-Huh?

96
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,910
TOMOKA: What's
the deal with her?

97
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:43,776
She's not even in the fan club,
and she's acting all flirty!

98
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,243
-Tomoka, please just calm down.

99
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:48,610
-Since you're not denying
it, it must be right.

100
00:04:48,643 --> 00:04:50,210
Hmm?

101
00:04:50,243 --> 00:04:53,543
Seigaku's top singles would
be team captain Tezuka.

102
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:56,143
And your number two
singles would be Fuji.

103
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:57,410
-You sure know a lot.

104
00:04:57,443 --> 00:05:01,510
AN: Well, the Seigaku
regulars are ultra-famous.

105
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:03,643
So tell me, which
one of you hotshots

106
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:05,843
is going to play
third singles, huh?

107
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:06,743
-Hmm.

108
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:07,443
Huh?

109
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:08,176
WAITRESS: Next, please.

110
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,976
-Huh?

111
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,410
I gotta go now.

112
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:13,843
Good luck, guys.

113
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:16,976
I'd like to order some
food to go, please.

114
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,843
-Can I help you?

115
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,643
Would you like something?

116
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:21,043
RYOMA AND MOMOSHIRO: Hmm.

117
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:23,410
A cheeseburger and a large cola.

118
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:25,043
Hmm?

119
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:25,876
-No, wait.

120
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,376
Make that a double cheeseburger.

121
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,543
-And some nuggets
and a shake, too.

122
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:32,076
-Add an order of
fries, and megasize it.

123
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,043
-Make it a large shake instead.

124
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:36,110
-Make that three
double cheeseburgers.

125
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:38,410
I'm starved after all
that tennis today.

126
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:39,243
-What?

127
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:41,343
-Double everything he ordered.

128
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:42,943
I practiced way
more than he did.

129
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:43,876
-OK.

130
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,176
-What is going on
with those two?

131
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,110
-Don't know.

132
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:51,643
-Hmm.

133
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,543
-Look at them eat.

134
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,643
This is gross.

135
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:10,343
I can't believe how
competitive they are.

136
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:11,543
-That's why they win.

137
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:14,810
[music playing]

138
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:21,110
SUMIRE: Hmm, who should
I put in third singles?

139
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:27,243
MAMOROU: Hi there, coach.

140
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:27,876
-Hi.

141
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,810
Glad you're here.

142
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:30,110
-I thought you might be hungry.

143
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,376
I brought this-- a nice snack.

144
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,076
-Thanks.

145
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,676
How thoughtful of you.

146
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,943
I'll make us some tea.

147
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:37,376
Come, sit down.

148
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,876
MAMOROU: Oh, uh, don't
worry about me, really.

149
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,043
SUMIRE: You're not with
your lady friend today?

150
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:46,210
-Oh, do you mean Saori Shiba?

151
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:47,176
SUMIRE: Yeah.

152
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,643
The two of you
make a nice couple.

153
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:49,943
-Oh, come on, coach.

154
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,510
Stop matchmaking.

155
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:54,610
Hmm, is that the lineup
for the district matches?

156
00:06:54,643 --> 00:06:56,510
Looks like you're having
a hard time with it.

157
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:59,476
That doesn't seem
very much like you.

158
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,910
-I've got an awful lot of
great talent this year.

159
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:03,210
-Thank you.

160
00:07:03,243 --> 00:07:06,010
So then, if you've decided
on the number one and number

161
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:08,943
two spots, that leaves
Kaoru or Momoshiro

162
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:10,376
for number three singles?

163
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,176
Right?

164
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,610
Hmm.

165
00:07:12,643 --> 00:07:14,143
-I'm only beginning.

166
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:16,210
It's the first
match of the year.

167
00:07:16,243 --> 00:07:18,176
But there's one
player in particular

168
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,976
I'm keeping an eye on.

169
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,876
MAMOROU: You mean Ryoma?

170
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,476
Why don't you let Tezuka or Fuji
sit out the first two or three

171
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,476
games of the year?

172
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,743
-It's not like I
haven't thought of that.

173
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:29,810
-I got it.

174
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:32,376
Why don't you talk
it over with Nanjiro?

175
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,810
He may have some
interesting ideas.

176
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:37,343
-I wouldn't ask that
good-for-nothing loser

177
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:38,310
for advice if my--

178
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:38,784
MAMOROU: Uh-oh.

179
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:39,484
Whoa.

180
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:40,484
Hmm, it's really late.

181
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:41,251
Uh, gotta run.

182
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:41,917
I'll be back.

183
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:44,517
Thanks for the tea.

184
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:45,151
Appreciate it.

185
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:48,451
Uh, bye coach.

186
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:49,251
-Oh, well.

187
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:50,684
Wasn't any help as usual.

188
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:58,784
[music playing]

189
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:00,884
I wonder if I should call.

190
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:02,451
I could use a little help.

191
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:10,984
[groaning]

192
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:14,484
MOMOSHIRO: I definitely
ate too much.

193
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:16,717
-That's because you
just wouldn't give up.

194
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:18,651
-Oh, knock it off.

195
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:20,784
I'm sick.

196
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:23,084
Listen, Echizen.

197
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:24,384
RYOMA: What is it?

198
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,817
-It's just like that girl
said before-- the first two

199
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:30,451
single spots are probably
going to go to Tezuka and Fuji.

200
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:34,217
Number one doubles is
locked up by Eiji and Oishi.

201
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:35,851
I don't know if you
know this, but they

202
00:08:35,884 --> 00:08:39,051
were our ace team that went all
the way to nationals last year.

203
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:41,951
So when you think about,
that leaves Taka, Viper, you,

204
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:43,317
and of course me.

205
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:48,351
We need one for singles, two in
doubles, and one on the bench.

206
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:49,751
So that means--

207
00:08:49,784 --> 00:08:52,517
RYOMA AND MOMOSHIRO: I'm gonna
get that third singles spot!

208
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:53,617
-Wait a minute.

209
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:55,251
You got your eye on
that singles spot, too?

210
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,517
-I'm not much of
a doubles player.

211
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:59,851
Coach makes the decision
on that one, right?

212
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:02,084
-She never says until
the last minute,

213
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:06,384
right before we're
ready go on the court.

214
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:08,217
RYOMA: I can't
wait till tomorrow.

215
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:09,984
MOMOSHIRO: Me either.

216
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,817
RYOMA: Well then, should
we settle it ourselves?

217
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:14,084
MOMOSHIRO: Good idea.

218
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:15,584
Let's do it.

219
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:17,984
You sure are quick
to pick a fight.

220
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:20,284
RYOMA: I just want to
get this over with.

221
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:22,217
MOMOSHIRO: OK, hotshot.

222
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:25,084
Let's go and see if we can find
a court with some lights on.

223
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:28,484
[music playing]

224
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:46,184
Hey, looks like we lucked
out and found a little street

225
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:46,684
tennis.

226
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:54,051
RYOMA: The lights look OK.

227
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:56,251
No complaints
whoever wins, right?

228
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:58,284
-You know, I'm glad to
hear you say that, pal.

229
00:09:58,317 --> 00:10:01,084
[music playing]

230
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:15,417
-Uh, excuse me.

231
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:17,151
Do you know if there's
a court fee here?

232
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,951
-No, you don't have to pay.

233
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:19,484
-Hey guys.

234
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:19,984
-Huh?

235
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:26,751
-Look, it's that girl.

236
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:27,251
-Huh?

237
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:33,217
-Never seen you guys before.

238
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:34,284
Have you ever played?

239
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:35,284
MOMOSHIRO: A little.

240
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:36,351
-That's great.

241
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:38,717
Looks like we got a
couple of beginners.

242
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:40,917
-And still only one court.

243
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:42,917
You guys know our rules?

244
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:44,251
-No.

245
00:10:44,284 --> 00:10:47,151
You know, I'm starting not
to like these guys very much.

246
00:10:47,184 --> 00:10:49,084
IZUMI: I guess I'll
just have to tell you.

247
00:10:49,117 --> 00:10:52,617
It's like a round robin--
a brutal round robin.

248
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,817
We play one game.

249
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:56,117
Whoever loses goes out.

250
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:57,284
-That sounds like fun.

251
00:10:57,317 --> 00:10:57,951
I'm first.

252
00:10:57,984 --> 00:10:58,917
OK, Echizen?

253
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,484
-I'll go first.

254
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:01,717
IZUMI: Oh.

255
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:05,584
And there's one more thing--
we only play doubles.

256
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:06,551
-Huh?

257
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:09,484
[music playing]

258
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:23,617
-We really doing this?

259
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:24,884
-We can't back down.

260
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,184
It'll look bad if we do.

261
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:31,184
UMPIRE: The Momoshiro/Echizen
team serves first.

262
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:32,251
Play ball.

[music playing]

264
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,179
-What was that call about?

265
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:49,346
-It was that old bat
driving me crazy.

266
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:51,413
And when I asked
her what she wanted,

267
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:53,746
she just kept right
on lecturing me.

268
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,113
-Don't be rude.

269
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:56,579
You owe her a lot.

270
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:59,113
She was your teacher, after all.

271
00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:01,213
NANIJIRO: That was
a long time ago.

272

Serves you right, uncle!

-Man, that hurt.

277
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:22,779
Oh, you know, when
she called, I think

278
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:25,346
the old bat had a question.

279
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,346
Ah, forget it.

280
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:31,746
-All right then.

281
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:33,579
You guys ready or what?

282
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:35,979
-Look, it's a kit
from middle school.

283
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:37,879
And one from grade school.

00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:39,546
-Pretty gutsy.

285
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:40,979
-I really don't like 'em.

286
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:43,513
-Let's just take 'em apart, OK?

-Those guys are in high school.

289
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:51,513
They're pretty big, so
hang in there if you can.

290
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:52,646
-I have had it.

291
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,079
They're going down.

292
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:55,646
Let's put them out
of their misery.

293
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,146
-Gotcha.

294
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:07,479

got all the right moves.

00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:25,613
Oh.

Oh, dude.

-Oh, man, did you guys see that?

-I've never seen that before.

303
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,479
-That was unbelievable.

Man, that was awesome.

That's pretty impressive
for around here.

Momoshiro/Echizen team.

-They're way better
than I thought.

got a lot of problems.

money they've never even played

00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:24,779

ball right down the middle.

at the net who's

00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,513
Is that the sideline
for doubles?

363
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:45,713
MOMOSHIRO: Yeah, so what?

364
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:48,046
-I've never even
played doubles before.

365
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:48,546
-What?

366
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:50,013
No way!

367
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:51,146
Never?

368
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:54,779
-Do I really look like
a team player to you?

369
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,179
-I'd say this game's
all but over for them.

370
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:02,613
-Echizen, we can't let these
clowns get the better of us.

371
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,146
-Gotcha.

UMPIRE: Game and set to
the Fukawa/Izumi team.

374
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:47,846
All right!

375
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:48,379
-What?

376
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:50,013
We lost it?

377
00:17:50,046 --> 00:17:52,713
We never even had a
chance to get into it.

378
00:17:52,746 --> 00:17:55,779
-Momo, face it-- we did
kind of stink up the court.

379
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:01,679
AN (VOICEOVER): And
that is no exaggeration.

380
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,946
RYOMA: You have a lousy
sense of teamwork.

381
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:06,146
-That's great coming from you.

382
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:07,579
Singles would have
been different.

383
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:09,979
We could have wiped the court.

384
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:11,579
-Hey, you two.

385
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:13,313
Are you going home now?

386
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:15,446
-We lost, so we kind of have to.

387
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:16,846
-That's for sure.

388
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:19,946
You two couldn't keep
up with those guys.

389
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:22,746
I expected more from
Seigaku regulars.

390
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:25,013
I thought you'd do better.

391
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:27,113
MOMOSHIRO: She's totally right.

392
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:28,446
That was so bad.

393
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,713
Well, let's go, Echizen.

394
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:33,513
-Fukawa, Izumi!

395
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,613
You guys rock!

396
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,979
You trashed two great players!

397
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:40,279
-Yeah, it's no wonder you
starred on the Grokurin team.

398
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:41,613
-Gyokurin team?

399
00:18:41,646 --> 00:18:43,013
Wait a minute.

400
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:44,879
Aren't they the first school we
play in the district matches?

401
00:18:44,913 --> 00:18:46,479
-Playing them will
be a walk over,

402
00:18:46,513 --> 00:18:48,646
especially if they play
like they did today.

403
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,079
-They're not bad,
not too bad at all.

404
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:53,179
But they're sure
not a doubles team.

405
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:01,279
IZUMI: No matter how many
times we played 'em, we'd win.

406
00:19:01,313 --> 00:19:02,513
FUKAWA: You got that right.

407
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:13,946
MOMOSHIRO: Listen, Echizen.

408
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:15,146
I've been thinking.

409
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,179
You know what I said about
taking that number three

410
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:18,413
singles spot?

411
00:19:18,446 --> 00:19:20,479
I changed my mind.

412
00:19:20,513 --> 00:19:22,413
-You know, I was
thinking the same thing.

413
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,113
RYOMA AND MOMOSHIRO:
We'll own those guys.

have called Nanjiro.

CASHIER: Hello.

419
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:04,713
That's 860 yen.

420
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,546
-Doubles for beginners, huh?

421
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:07,846
He's probably a novice.

422
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:08,879
How cute.

423

-He'll hear you!

see us again soon.

-I'm Izumi from
Gyokurin Middle School.

-And I'm Fukawa,
also from Gyokurin.

IZUMI: Hey, Fukawa.

429
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:03,169
Those guys we played
doubles with the other night

430
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:04,236
were pathetic.

431
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:05,636
They're both really
good players,

432
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:07,569
but they just couldn't
get it together.

FUKAWA: Hey, look, Izumi.

434
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,336
Our opponents are
those same guys.

IZUMI: No kidding?

436
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:13,803
And they're from Seigaku?

437
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:14,769
Awesome.

438
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:16,869

MOMOSHIRO: Next on the Prince
of Tennis-- "The Perfect Match."

talking about us?

FUKAWA: You bet.
