1
00:00:09,724 --> 00:00:11,624
-To the left!

2
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:14,024
[grunting]

3
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:15,690
-Trying to ace me, brat?

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,524
Don't make me laugh.

5
00:00:19,457 --> 00:00:20,757
-Oh, no!

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,557
He's going to lose the point
on yet another passing shot!

7
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:32,490
[music playing]

8
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:46,932
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): Dad?

9
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,732
RYOMA (VOICEOVER):
I want to be strong!

10
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,666
[screaming]

11
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:32,332
-He changed directions
while he was in mid step.

12
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:34,532
-The kid's standing up.

13
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:38,099
And against Akutsu!

14
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:39,866
-Yes sir-ee.

15
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:41,132
SADAHARU: That seventh grader.

16
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:51,366
[spitting]

17
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,499
UMPIRE: 40-30.

18
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:53,466
-All right!

19
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:56,399
Echizen!

20
00:02:56,432 --> 00:02:58,832
-Ryoma really
dominated that point!

21
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:00,566
-That is totally amazing!

22
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,299
-Ryoma let's win this, come on!

23
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:07,399
[swooning]

24
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:10,399
-Both of these players
sure have a lot of spirit.

25
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:13,666
-It sure is getting interesting.

26
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:15,666
-They still have a ways to go.

27
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:19,299
This is still child's play.

28
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,899
-But these kids
are really awesome,

29
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:26,899
SADAHARU: He never
fails to amaze me.

30
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,699
-First he made his
move over to the left.

31
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:33,032
SADAHARU: Then he shifted to
the right without taking a step.

32
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:34,132
Is that possible?

33
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,366
-So what do you think, Tezuka?

34
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:41,532
-It's because Echizen only uses
one foot on his split step.

35
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:42,899
-Right.

36
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:46,266
The normal split step would have
made him a step or two late.

37
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:49,799
Then he wouldn't have made
it to the ball on time.

38
00:03:49,832 --> 00:03:51,766
-I guess only one
foot was supposed

39
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,566
to be used in the
original split step.

40
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,766
-Yeah, I think you're right.

41
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,499
KAORU: That guy made
Echizen dig deep.

42
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,166
-And he also brought out
his dormant abilities.

43
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:10,666
-Our seventh grader sure
showed us some amazing stuff.

44
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:11,666
TAKESHI: That's our boy.

45
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:18,932
AKUTSU: You think I'm
just a stepping stone?

46
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,866
Don't make me laugh.

47
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,866
Take this!

48
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:30,499
-Enough for a
return winner again!

49
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:32,432
-I told you you're
wasting your time.

50
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,099
-Oh no, he's got it!

51
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:40,566
AKUTSU: What the?

52
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:41,999
UMPIRE: Deuce.

53
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,032
-Yeah, he did it!

54
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:47,966
-Great, his shot
sailed by Akutsu.

55
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,932
[chuckling]

56
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:51,399
-Yay, Ryoma, yay!

57
00:04:51,432 --> 00:04:55,832
Hey, Sakuno, I've never seen
you this excited before.

58
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:57,066
-Huh?

59
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,599
I don't know what you mean.

60
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:09,599
AKUTSU (VOICEOVER): He's
moving faster and cleaner now.

61
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:18,266
AKUTSU (VOICEOVER):
Don't get carried away.

62
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:24,199
AKUTSU (VOICEOVER): Look
the other way, brat.

63
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:38,966
[breathing hard]

64
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:41,432
UMPIRE: Advantage,
Echizen of Seigaku.

65
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,166
-Man, he returned it by using
his one legged split step.

66
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:44,999
[whistling]

67
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:47,732
-Echizen's good all right.

68
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:50,232
-Wow, that seventh grader's
completely changed the way

69
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,466
he moves in the
middle of a match.

70
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:53,532
-It's scary.

71
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:55,932
And he's still just
developing his game.

72
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:05,932
-Look Echizen's on fire.

73
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,699
-You're right, he's outstanding.

74
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:09,666
-Huh?

75
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,066
Wow, Kaido.

76
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,232
That's the first time I've ever
heard you say something nice.

77
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:14,166
[growling]

78
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,466
-Hey, just shut up.

79
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:18,832
-Come on, you brat!

80
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:24,366
-Huh?

81
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:24,866
-No way!

82
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,232
UMPIRE: Game!

83
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,066
Echizen of Seigaku leads
three games to one.

84
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:32,866
-There it is!

85
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,366
It's the Drive B!

86
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,932
-All right!

87
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:39,266
[shouting and cheering]

88
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,499
-Good, he caught up.

89
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:47,532
-Wow, this is really
starting to get interesting.

90
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:48,032
-Mmm-hmm.

91
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:56,866
-Well, Banji.

92
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,566
I'm grateful to you.

93
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:02,266
I truly appreciate that you had
Akutsu play this match today.

94
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:07,299
-I don't know what you mean.

95
00:07:07,332 --> 00:07:09,866
-Thanks to him, looks
like samurai junior

96
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:13,032
became just plain samurai.

97
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,832
Ryoma Echizen became
a warrior today.

98
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:23,766
-Yes, Echizen sure is
a first class player.

99
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:26,266
To tell the truth,
I didn't expect

100
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:29,166
Ryoma to be so strong at
such a very young age.

101
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,832
It kind of took me by surprise.

102
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,532
But you know what?

103
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:38,099
Akutsu's tough, and he's not
about to let it end like this.

104
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:39,432
-Hmm?

105
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:40,999
-Look carefully, coach.

106
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:42,699
There's a reason
why he can't lose.

107
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,032
-A reason he can't lose?

108
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:50,532
-Yes.

109
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:54,599
KAORU: Game!

110
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:58,466
Echizen of Seigaku leads
three games to two.

111
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:00,366
-You're playing very well.

112
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:00,932
RYOMA: Thanks.

113
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:06,066
-But you still
have to be careful.

114
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:11,732
I know Banji very well, and I'm
sure he's planning something.

115
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:15,099
Thing is, I've seen plenty of
his dirty tricks before, Ryoma.

116
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:33,432
-He's brutal.

117
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:34,699
-Huh?

118
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:38,966
-It still makes me mad
when I think about it.

119
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:39,999
Ryoma?

120
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:44,532
Be sure to destroy him.

121
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,666
-Huh.

122
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,432
Guess you can't
let it go, can you?

123
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:52,132
NANJIRO: Ryoma's really
reaching his potential fast.

124
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,932
At this rate, it
might be possible.

125
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,299
-You just don't get it, do you?

126
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:58,566
-What?

127
00:08:58,599 --> 00:09:00,999
-It all begins now.

128
00:09:01,032 --> 00:09:04,032
NANJIRO: Banji will show us
his real talent as a coach.

129
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:06,799
From here on in my kid'll
have to prove whether or not

130
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:09,032
he's a strong player.

131
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:13,399
Wow, I'm really getting hungry.

132
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:16,499
-You mean, you're not
sticking around then?

133
00:09:16,532 --> 00:09:17,932
NANJIRO: I don't think so.

134
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:21,232
This is all just child's play.

135
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:24,766
[sigh]

136
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,032
NANJIRO: Well, Ryoma?

137
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,799
What are you going to do?

138
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:31,099
[breathing hard]

139
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,532
-Hey there, Akutsu.

140
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:42,232
You better watch those
manners of yours.

141
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:44,999
AKUTSU: Who you
talking to, old man?

142
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:47,499
I'll bash in your
stupid old head.

143
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:48,632
-Well, well.

144
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,299
You still have some fight left.

145
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:57,466
AKUTSU: Stop bothering me.

146
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:59,399
I'm telling you, I'm not
going to play tennis.

147
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:04,032
-It's a gift.

148
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:07,699
Your shoulders are strong.

149
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,199
-Just lay off of me.

150
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:10,432
-No, I won't.

151
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:13,699
You've got to play, son.

152
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:17,366
You just don't see solid
forearms like this every day.

153
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:17,866
-Huh?

154
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:24,932
BANJI: Akutsu, this may just
be an old man's rambling,

155
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:29,866
so go ahead and ignore
me if you want to.

156
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,232
-Huh?

157
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:34,499
-That boy's game is
improving by leaps and bounds

158
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:38,366
as the match is
progressing along.

159
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,299
And it looks like
he's figured out

160
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:42,032
how to adjust to
your pace, Akutsu.

161
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:47,766
BANJI: I can tell you this.

162
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:50,699
There are lots of players on
the national tennis circuit who

163
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:53,299
will give you a
run for your money.

164
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:56,966
You'll find a dime a dozen.

165
00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:00,232
-What exactly you try
to get at, old man?

166
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:04,299
-It's just, I think it's more
fun to be burning with passion

167
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:08,499
and it is to be bored to death.

168
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:11,666
Wouldn't you agree
with me, Akutsu?

169
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:14,466
AKUTSU: Why you!

170
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:17,666
Stop bossing me around.

171
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:20,199
BANJI: I didn't mean
to boss you around.

172
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:23,066
However, even though
you seem to hate it,

173
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,699
playing tennis isn't really
so bad after all, now is it?

174
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:29,166
I think it might do
you a world of good

175
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:32,132
to listen to an old
man's ramblings.

176
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,732
At least you could
kill some time.

177
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:39,732
So, what you think about
joining the tennis team?

178
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:49,066
-Akutsu, how about changing
up your pace a bit?

179
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:51,966
You don't have to be so
aggressive all the time.

180
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:59,332
-Who are you ordering around?

181
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:01,832
[chuckling]

182
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:14,132
AKUTSU (VOICEOVER):
Who do you think I am?

183
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,066
I'm Jin Akutsu.

184
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:20,532
Nobody stands a
chance against me.

185
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:24,866
I've crushed everyone
who's gotten in my way.

186
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,999
Up until now.

187
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:28,999
And from now on, too!

188
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,061
-Coach Ryuzaki?

189
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:48,494
If a person practices very
hard, there's really nothing

190
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:52,228
to be ashamed of he
happens to lose a match.

191
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:55,261
BANJI: But when someone mocks
the sport and hardly ever

192
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:59,661
practices, when that
person loses a match, well,

193
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:00,894
that is just humiliating.

194
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:10,328
And that is the reason
why he just can't lose.

195
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:13,194
ALL: Whoa!

196
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:18,561
BANJI: I know he can't
stand that kind of disgrace.

197
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:20,428
RYOMA: You have a ways to go.

198
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:21,828
AKUTSU: Give me a
break, you punk.

199
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:39,394
-Oh, no.

200
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:43,828
It appears Echizen's having
problems with his defense.

201
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:44,728
-Hey!

202
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:45,928
What's going on?

203
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:46,428
-Ryoma?

204
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,094
-I told you, brat.

205
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:51,328
I'll take you apart!

206
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:56,561
UMPIRE: Game!

207
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:58,761
Akutsu of Yamabuki leads
four games to three.

208
00:13:58,794 --> 00:13:59,628
-Oh, no!

209
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:01,394
Now he's lost his lead!

210
00:14:01,428 --> 00:14:03,294
Come on, Ryoma, go!

211
00:14:03,328 --> 00:14:07,228
You can trash this
loser and make him pay!

212
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:13,094
[breathing hard]

213
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:15,561
-Looks like he
changed up his plays.

214
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:17,994
He's not solely relying
on his aggressive game

215
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:18,794
like he was before.

216
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:24,594
BANJI (VOICEOVER):
It's not easy for you

217
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:29,061
to take someone else's advice

218
00:14:29,094 --> 00:14:31,061
-Let's see what you've got.

219
00:14:31,094 --> 00:14:34,061
And show me how determined
you are to beat this rookie.

220
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:39,994
NANJIRO: Ka-pow.

221
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:59,894
[breathing hard]

222
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:20,661
[cheering]

223
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:22,061
NANJIRO: Get stronger, Ryoma.

224
00:15:29,794 --> 00:15:32,694
-Man, Akutsu's really
turning up the heat.

225
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:35,094
I don't think there's
anyone who can stop him now.

226
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:39,628
-It looks like short stuff
might be able to stop him.

227
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:42,128
-Don't count on it.

228
00:15:42,161 --> 00:15:44,561
-You know, anything is
still possible, man.

229
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:46,294
That's the true
beauty of tennis.

230
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:01,594
-It appears Echizen had
adapted to his fastballs,

231
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,561
but it's still tough for
him to change up the pace.

232
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:08,094
-It's amazing how could you can
just change his game so fast

233
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:09,294
like that.

234
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:11,494
-That coach certainly
has an incredible ability

235
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:13,461
to get through to his player.

236
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:15,328
-Nanjiro was right.

237
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:17,828
Banda directs a player
by little hints,

238
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:20,194
and he changes the
course of a game.

239
00:16:20,228 --> 00:16:22,694
He's an outstanding coach.

240
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:25,594
Hmm.

241
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:27,528
AKUTSU (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe it.

242
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:28,994
The old man was right.

243
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:35,528
I'm varying the
tempo of my shots.

244
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,394
My drives are becoming
much more effective.

245
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:42,428
BANJI: What do you
think, Echizen?

246
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:46,361
Can you compete with Akutsu now?

247
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:46,861
RYOMA: Huh.

248
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:54,994
-Huh?

249
00:16:55,028 --> 00:16:57,828
RYOMA: Ha!

250
00:16:57,861 --> 00:16:59,994
-No way!

251
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:02,828
He hasn't given up yet!

252
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:03,728
-Come on, kid.

253
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,028
Try and stop this!

254
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:14,694
-I don't think either
of them will back off.

255
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:16,361
-Yeah you're right.

256
00:17:16,394 --> 00:17:17,994
How will this end?

257
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:20,294
I'll have to see.

258
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:23,094
-It's going to go
right down to the wire.

259
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:24,961
I guess there's
nothing at all that

260
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:26,528
can stop now, at this point.

261
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:32,761
AKUTSU (VOICEOVER):
That's useless.

262
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:41,361
TAKASHI: Ryoma had
him figured out.

263
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,494
At least until Akutsu went
and modified his game plan.

264
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:50,094
And thanks to some really
good coaching, Akutsu's game

265
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:53,628
has reached a whole new level.

266
00:17:53,661 --> 00:17:57,294
Normally the pressure will
cause a player to fall apart.

267
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:59,161
-Yeah, but it looks
like our Echizen

268
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:01,894
hasn't given in to
Akutsu mentally.

269
00:18:01,928 --> 00:18:02,928
-That's right.

270
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:06,394
He's playing like real champ.

271
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:09,961
-Echizen knows instinctively
that the very worst thing

272
00:18:09,994 --> 00:18:12,261
he can do at this
time is to tense up

273
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:13,828
on the tennis court like that.

274
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:20,661
KUNIMITSU: Tennis is
a unique kind of sport

275
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:24,294
that ultimately depends on both
technique and mental agility

276
00:18:24,328 --> 00:18:24,794
as well.

277
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:32,794
RYOMA: Hey!

278
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:34,828
If you'd stuck to karate,
you wouldn't have a shrimp

279
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:38,294
like me beating you.

280
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:39,228
AKUTSU: There's no way!

281
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:54,128
-Akutsu's pride or
Echizen's courage?

282
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:56,428
Whichever one stronger
will give us the winner.

283
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,628
-The world champ, huh?

284
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:36,494
-Ha ha!

285
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:38,661
-Wow, he made it!

286
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:41,561
-Ryoma got to--

287
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:44,128
-The match point, wowee!

288
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:48,661
-Man, I'm getting all
weak in the knees, Sakuno!

289
00:19:48,694 --> 00:19:51,628
SAORI: You know, perhaps
this is what tennis is really

290
00:19:51,661 --> 00:19:54,328
all about.

291
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,561
It really doesn't matter
who wins the match.

292
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:58,161
In the end it's
important to know

293
00:19:58,194 --> 00:19:59,661
that the ultimate
moment of truth

294
00:19:59,694 --> 00:20:02,428
will arrive no matter
what we try to do.

295
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,428
-Did you say "the
ultimate moment of truth?"

296
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:06,861
-Yes, I did.

297
00:20:06,894 --> 00:20:09,361
It's the magical moment
when two individuals let

298
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:12,494
their spirits come
together as one.

299
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:15,728
It's truly an incredible
thing to behold.

300
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:16,461
-Two spirits.

301
00:20:26,228 --> 00:20:31,161
[music playing]

302
00:21:35,297 --> 00:21:41,231
[music playing]

303
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:07,763
RYOMA: Hi, I'm Ryoma.

304
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:11,130
I see you're doing OK,
but I believe you still

305
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,763
owe me for Kachiro,
for Kawamura, oh yeah,

306
00:22:14,797 --> 00:22:16,563
and for Arai, too.

307
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:19,297
Well, the game has
reached its climax,

308
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,030
so I'm going to finish
it already and win

309
00:22:22,063 --> 00:22:24,097
the metropolitan matches.

310
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,497
Next, on the Prince of
Tennis, the decisive moment.

311
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,463
Oh, wait!

312
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:32,097
You owe me one for myself, too!
