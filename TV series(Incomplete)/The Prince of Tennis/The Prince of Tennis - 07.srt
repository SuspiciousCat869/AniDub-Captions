UMPIRE: Game to Inui.

2
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,677
-How'd he do that?

3
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,610
-Man, he really knows his stuff.

4
00:00:22,644 --> 00:00:23,377
-That's weird.

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,477
Ryoma got totally wiped out.

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,410
He didn't even win
a single point.

7
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,944
KATSUO: I thought
he had a chance.

8
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:31,477
It was like Sadaharu knew
every move Ryoma was gonna

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,410
make before he
even hit the ball.

10
00:00:33,444 --> 00:00:34,544
He's strong.

00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:07,538
-16%, 25% over to the right
minus 75% I likelihood that

13
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:10,671

15
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:24,605
Yes, I've got it.

16
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,371
-It's out.

17
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,238
That's deuce.

18
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:54,771
-Yay!

19
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:55,771
-Way to go!

20
00:02:55,805 --> 00:02:57,238
That's the ticket!

21
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:58,805
-Wow, he's amazing.

22
00:02:58,838 --> 00:03:01,805
I was blown away by Ryoma's
match the other day.

23
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:03,505
Could it be that
these junior high kids

24
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:05,138
are really as good
as they seem to be?

25
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:06,871
-Yep, it's amazing.

26
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:09,938
This is only one of the top
tennis schools in all of Tokyo.

27
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:10,705
-What do you mean?

28
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:11,838
There are other?

29
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:12,871
-Sure, there are.

30
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:14,838
They play against each
other all the time.

31
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:17,038
That's the way they
improve their games.

32
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,038
-Well, I guess they're lucky to
have such strong competition.

33
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:21,738
-Even within the school.

34
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:22,905
Take a look.

35
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:24,805
There's Shuichiro playing
the team's captain.

36
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:25,805
-Hmm?

37
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,038
-Because the team
is deep, the captain

38
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:30,005
has lots of top-level players
who can challenge him.

39
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:31,571
By playing each
other, the whole team

40
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:32,838
just gets better and better.

41
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:33,738
It's awesome.

42
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:34,238
-Oh.

43
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:40,938
-A team like this,
they'll be able to take

44
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,671
on any other school
in the league.

45
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:45,171
They're sure to be
right at the top.

46
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:46,471
They're that good.

47
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:47,238
-Huh?

48
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:48,771
Shiba, are you listening?

49
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:51,405
-Kunimitsu is great.

50
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:52,571
-Get a grip on yourself.

[music playing]

52
00:04:02,338 --> 00:04:05,005
-Isn't Ryoma's match
gonna start up soon?

53
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:06,405
-Shouldn't be much longer.

54
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:08,538
-I don't know how Ryoma does it.

55
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:10,638
He ever looks nervous, ever.

56
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:12,005
-I'd be nervous if I were him.

57
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:14,605
He's playing Sadaharu,
a ninth grade regular.

58
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:15,438
-Wow.

59
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:17,105
I hope Ryoma wins.

60
00:04:17,138 --> 00:04:19,971
If he wins, he'll become a
regular member of the team.

61
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,405
-Is Sadaharu that good?

62
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:22,671
MOMO: He's that good all right.

63
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:23,171
-Huh?

64
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:24,705
Momoshiro.

65
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,238
-You can call me Momo.

66
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:28,071
-Just Momo?

67
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:30,371
I can't do that.

68
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:32,271
-Don't worry about
it, little man.

69
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,371
-Can you tell me what kind
of player is Sadaharu?

70
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:35,671
-Ah, yeah.

71
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:38,605
Sadaharu's one of the best
ninth graders on the squad.

72
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:41,571
This last year, he's never
missed making the regular team.

73
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:44,805
And by the way, he's
not my favorite.

74
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:46,605
-Oh.

75
00:04:46,638 --> 00:04:48,271
-Because Sadaharu plays--

76
00:04:48,305 --> 00:04:48,905
EIJI: Hey, Momo.

77
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:49,705
-Hmm?

78
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:51,738
Oh, I didn't hear you.

79
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:53,738
-You checking out
the new talent?

80
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:55,005
-Thought I'd catch a game.

81
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:56,138
Echizen is up.

82
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:56,971
-Oh yeah?

83
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,738
You have a match now with me.

84
00:04:58,771 --> 00:04:59,538
-Oh, really?

85
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:00,205
It's time?

86
00:05:00,238 --> 00:05:01,505
I can't believe it.

87
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,538
-Of course, if you want to
stay around here and watch,

88
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:04,871
I'll take the default.

89
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,471
-Come on, don't
mess around, Eiji.

90
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:08,505
Of course I want to play you.

91

00:05:10,438 --> 00:05:11,105

-Well, that's that.

-But he didn't even
tell us about Sadaharu.

it up or Ryoma's match

Excuse me, sir.

Can you tell me where
the seventh grader Ryoma

difference between them.

It's like a kid
playing an adult.

leave nothing on the court.

-Done.

Don't you think
Sadaharu's scary?

-It won't matter.

121
00:06:35,738 --> 00:06:37,571
Ryoma knows his
stuff inside-out.

122
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,071
He'll do just fine.

Every move is perfect.

SADAHARU (VOICEOVER):
He'll miss this.

UMPIRE: 15-0.

129
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:02,071
-Sadaharu just won
the first point.

130
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:05,205
-It seemed like he knew exactly
where the ball was going to go.

131
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:06,171
-Impossible.

132
00:07:06,205 --> 00:07:07,538
It's just coincidence.

133
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:08,805
-Yeah, maybe so.

134
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:12,271
But Sadaharu plays an absolutely
perfect textbook game.

135
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:14,871
But I think that Kaoru's
Snake was way more impressive

136

than that, if you ask me.

-That's for sure.

138

Sadaharu's serve may be
fast, but Ryoma's ball

139
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:22,705
has way more movement
and much better angles.

-I wonder if it's possible.

164
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,638
Maybe Sadaharu does know where
Ryoma will return the ball.

165

-Could he really be that good?

can't be that good.

00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:57,638
How does Sadaharu
know exactly where

183
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,105
Ryoma's gonna hit the ball?

184
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,605

The game's not nearly over yet.

190
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:16,938
Ryoma Echizen will come back.

191
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:18,438
He's tough.

192
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,438
-No way, he got it!

193
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:22,171
SADAHARU (VOICEOVER):
Yes, but the ball's

194
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:25,271
going to miss by
two ball widths.

-That's weird.

199

Ryoma got totally wiped out.

He didn't even win
a single point.

KATSUO: I thought
he had a chance.

202

It was like Sadaharu knew
every move Ryoma was gonna

203
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:52,038
make before he
even hit the ball.

204
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:53,171

[music playing]

211
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:02,326
SADAHARU: 25%.

212
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:04,026
-Huh?

213
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:06,026
SADAHARU: Counting your
match against Kaoru,

214
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:08,159
I've seen four of your matches.

215
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:14,859
Straight 12 times, crosscourt
five times, lob three times.

216
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:17,592
According to my
calculations, the probability

217
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:20,226
of a crosscourt return
against a slice approach

218
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:23,692
like the one I just hit is
more than likely to be 25%.

219
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:32,826
And you wouldn't dare hit a lob
against a top player like I am.

220
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,726
The right side was wide open for
a down-the-line passing shot.

221
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,926
But because you're such a
strong, aggressive player,

222
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,626
you aimed crosscourt
to try to outwit me.

223
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:46,526
So then, the inverse
of the 25% is

224
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,959
there's a 75% probability
of a crosscourt shot.

225
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:53,892
I have your tennis
game all figured out.

226
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:08,226
Now I wonder if it helps,
all my data on you?

227
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:09,159
-Hmm.

228
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:11,559
What a crummy way to play.

229
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:12,859
-Huh.

230
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:15,126
Rookies just never get it.

231
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:18,726
-It looks like Sadaharu did know
where the balls were gonna go.

232
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,859
-Oh, Sadaharu is the best.

233
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:23,459
I think he's an even
better player than Kaoru.

you were going to fault.

to lose, as well.

hit his serve into the net

00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,092
on purpose?

he won't win like that.

-Hmm.

I'm embarrassed to
admit it, but it

258
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:48,326
seems Sadaharu has more
data on Ryoma than I have.

-My point it this-- since he
doesn't have any data on me,

261
00:13:52,126 --> 00:13:53,826
if I played him, I'd win.

00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:51,992
Ryoma lost his serve.

359
00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:54,392
-Well, you know, it's not
so easy to make changes

360
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,892
in your style of
play, especially when

361
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:58,892
you're under that much pressure.

362
00:18:58,926 --> 00:19:01,092
You try new stuff over and
over, but your opponent

363
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:02,259
is there waiting.

364
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,126
And any normal
player would probably

365
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,059
panic and self-destruct
right about now.

366
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:09,992
-You're a very good player.

367
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:13,226
You've calculated my
reach as well as my height

368
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:16,626
and always aim just beyond that.

369
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:18,692
You've got more
talent than I do.

370
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:19,826
You're strong.

371
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,359
But you know, as long
as I know your shots--

372
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:27,159
where your returns are coming--
there's no shot I can't return.

373

374
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:41,226
One day, I think you're set
to become a Seigaku regular.

375
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:45,492
But this time, I'm going to win.

376
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:48,192
-You still have a ways to go.

377
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:49,626
-Hmm?

378
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:51,526
-Huh?

379
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:57,226
[music playing]

380
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:00,192
-I'm glad I came to
Seigaku because now I

381
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:02,659
get to beat all kinds
of tennis players.

382
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:06,659

383
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:27,520
[theme music]

384
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:56,237
-Hi!

385
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:58,604
I'm Tomoka Osakada,
Sakuno's friend

386
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:01,104
and the the president
of Ryoma's fan club.

387
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:05,404
Sadaharu studied Ryoma's tennis
and figured out his every shot.

388
00:21:05,437 --> 00:21:06,737
How evil!

389
00:21:06,771 --> 00:21:08,904
But Ryoma's really something.

390
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:12,404
He switches shots on purpose,
and his footwork is awesome!

391
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,271
He's so cool!

392
00:21:14,304 --> 00:21:17,804
Next, on the "Prince of
Tennis"-- "Split Step."

393
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:21,204
Ooh, Ryoma, you're wonderful!
