1
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:15,493
-Yikes!

2
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:16,760
He's moving to the net!

3
00:00:16,793 --> 00:00:17,460
-Of course!

4
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:18,793
If he goes to the net--

5
00:00:18,826 --> 00:00:21,826
-He might be able to catch up!

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,326
With the Ryoma Split Step!

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,326
[theme music]

8
00:01:57,165 --> 00:01:58,765
-You're wasting your time, brat!

9
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:05,665
-Huh?

10
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:09,598
-No way!

11
00:02:09,632 --> 00:02:12,865
-After our guy jumped, he--

12
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:15,832
-He hit it in the
opposite direction.

13
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:27,698
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): He can't hit
cross court from that position.

14
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:40,732
ANNOUNCER: 40-Love.

15
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:05,065
-Echizen, hang in there.

16
00:03:07,698 --> 00:03:09,198
JIN (VOICEOVER):
Hey, Kawamura, you

17
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:11,265
think this little
brat can beat me?

18
00:03:14,032 --> 00:03:20,665
MEN: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

19
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:24,398
1, 2, 3, 4--

20
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:25,465
-Look at them.

21
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:29,432
Our senior classmates
sure look awesome.

22
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:31,932
But the best one is Sumoto.

23
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:33,165
-Yeah.

24
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:35,432
He's the best among all the
junior high school guys.

25
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,965
-9, 10.

26
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:43,465
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6--

27
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:45,232
-Huh.

28
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:47,098
Hey, who's that over there?

29
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:47,732
-Huh?

30
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:48,665
Oh, that's Akutsu.

31
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:50,132
-You know him?

32
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:54,232
-Well, he sort of
lives near where I do.

33
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:55,698
-What's all that noise?

34
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:57,498
-Oh, we're sorry.

35
00:03:57,532 --> 00:04:00,232
It's just that we've got
a visitor in here today.

36
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:01,132
-Does he want to join?

37
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:08,665
Our teacher isn't here now.

38
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:09,998
If you want to
join, you're going

39
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:11,998
to have to come back
some other-- huh?

40
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:14,598
-I heard that there were some
tough guys at this place.

41
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:16,365
But you don't really
look that tough to me.

42
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:21,165
You, there.

43
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:23,298
How long have you
ben studying karate?

44
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:24,232
-What?

45
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,465
Hey, if yo uwant
to join this club,

46
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,932
you'd better not talk that way.

47
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:28,498
If you want to be
part of the group,

48
00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:30,032
fine, but you'd
better straighten up,

49
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:31,298
starting right now.

50
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:33,432
-Don't order me around!

51
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:34,565
-Huh?

52
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:36,298
-If you're gonna act so
tough, well, then, you'd

53
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:38,132
better make sure you
can beat me first.

54
00:04:38,165 --> 00:04:39,632
Otherwise--

55
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:41,732
-Who does this smart
alec think he is?

56
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:43,465
-Well, if your
brain won't listen,

57
00:04:43,498 --> 00:04:45,298
then I'll have to teach
your body to listen.

58
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:46,432
-Hey, quit it, Sumoto.

59
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:48,632
If the teacher finds out
about that, you know--

60
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:49,665
-Just leave it to me.

61
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:55,065
-Man, this has really
turned into trouble.

62
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:11,265
This is impossible, Akutsu.

63
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:13,732
A beginning going
up against Sumoto?

64
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:16,165
Even the assistant
coach defers to him.

65
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:29,965
-Hey, if that's the best you
can do, you won't beat me.

66
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:43,832
Well, now, what's wrong?

67
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:45,465
Had enough of this yet?

68
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,798
By the look in your eye,
I'd say you wanted more.

69
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:48,665
Come on, then.

70
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:51,398
One more.

71
00:05:51,432 --> 00:05:52,698
-Ah!

72
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:53,865
Argh!

73
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:54,365
Ow!

74
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:55,198
My arm!

75
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:58,298
My arm!

76
00:05:58,332 --> 00:05:58,998
-Come on, Sumoto.

77
00:05:59,032 --> 00:06:00,365
You all right?

78
00:06:00,398 --> 00:06:01,798
-Master Sumoto!

79
00:06:01,832 --> 00:06:03,665
[laughter]

80
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:06,032
-I thought you were
supposed to be tough.

81
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,065
I expected more out of you.

82
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:09,698
-What did you say, punk?

83
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:11,165
-I'll teach you a lesson!

84
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:12,898
[shout]

85
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:21,265
[shouting]

86
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:38,498
-Heh.

87
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:52,032
ANNOUNCER: Game to
Yamabuki's Akutsu.

88
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:53,898
Two games to love.

89
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:54,765
-Oh, Ryoma!

90
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:55,598
-Don't worry.

91
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:57,598
It's Ryoma we're talking about.

92
00:06:57,632 --> 00:06:58,998
-Did you see that?

93
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:01,665
He waits until Echizen moves,
then changes where he hits it.

94
00:07:01,698 --> 00:07:04,098
-I don't see how
he's able to do that.

95
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,032
-But if Ryoma waits to move
until Akutsu hits the ball,

96
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:08,298
then it is too late.

97
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:10,132
-That's gotta be humiliating.

98
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:11,998
Echizen jumps one
way, but the ball

99
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,432
goes in the opposite
direction behind him.

100
00:07:14,465 --> 00:07:15,832
BOY (VOICEOVER):
Akutsu, no matter

101
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:17,732
what you do, you
always act strong.

102
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:24,465
[groaning]

103
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:30,232
[coughing]

104
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:34,665
-The one kid-- kiddin' me.

105
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:36,398
-Hey!

106
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:37,565
Akutsu!

107
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:39,732
-Huh?

108
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:40,298
Who are you?

109
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:41,598
You want some?

110
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:42,298
-No, it's me.

111
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:43,798
From the sushi place.

112
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:44,432
-Oh, yeah.

113
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,632
You're Kawamura, right?

114
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,898
What do you want with me?

115
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:50,098
-Just tell me why you
do things like this.

116
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:53,832
Hey, Akutsu.

117
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:14,232
Huh?

118
00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:16,298
It's Akutsu.

119
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:18,965
WOMAN: Jin, now please,
don't make anymore trouble.

120
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,098
JIN: Shut up!

121
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,032
I told you not to
order me around.

122
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:23,032
-Jin.

123
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:23,532
Jin!

124
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:54,932
-Huh?

125
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:07,098
-You got something to say to me?

126
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,198
-Not really.

127
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:11,032
I just thought that you
were really amazing.

128
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:12,898
You'd never studied
karate before,

129
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:15,598
yet you went up against
those advanced guys.

130
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:18,332
But you better watch
yourself around here.

131
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:21,698
If you go about doing stuff like
that, you might find that you--

132
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:24,465
-Don't you dare try
to order me around!

133
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,332
-I'm not trying to
order you around.

134
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,698
I'm worried about you.

135
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:28,565
That's all.

136
00:09:28,598 --> 00:09:29,065
-Worried?

137
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:33,798
Who do you think
you're talking to?

138
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:35,365
A baby?

139
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:37,932
No matter who the opponent
is, I'll never lose.

140
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:38,665
I swear it.

141
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:44,065
Remember that.

142
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,832
Is that all you can do, brat?

143
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,665
Forget it.

144
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:12,965
Cause now I attack.

145
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:21,198
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): To the right!

146
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:40,465
ANNOUNCER: 30-Love.

147
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:43,198
-Other way, you brat.

148
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:44,465
-Oh no, not again!

149
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:46,265
He keeps hitting it
to the opposite side!

150
00:10:46,298 --> 00:10:49,332
-Inui, the stuff that beats
your data driven tennis.

151
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:53,665
-Should have been enough, but I
gather it just doesn't hold up.

152
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:55,198
There's no chance
it can stand up

153
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:58,398
to that guy's
physical abilities.

154
00:10:58,432 --> 00:11:00,832
Echizen can
instinctively tell, even

155
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:03,998
at the very last second, which
direction his opponent will

156
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,365
hit the ball.

157
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,098
With his unique one
legged split step,

158
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:10,432
he always seems at
least a step and a half

159
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:13,665
quicker than the average player.

160
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:15,898
However, that's no
advantage against Akutsu.

161
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:29,565
ANNOUNCER: 40-Love!

162
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:37,732
-It's unbelievable, but Akutsu
can change the ball's direction

163
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:40,232
even after Echizen
has anticipated it.

164
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:46,998
What makes this possible is
his innate sense of balance,

165
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:50,932
the flexibility of his muscles,
the spring in his body,

166
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:53,565
and his natural gifts
as an ace tennis player.

167
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,412
-Yeah!

168
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:05,912
[cheering]

169
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:11,012
-I told you before, brat.

170
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:13,212
I'm not giving up
even one point to you.

171
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:28,445
-Inui, what would you say are
the chances Ryome will win?

172
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:29,378
-Impossible!

173
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:30,912
The guy's invincible!

174
00:12:30,945 --> 00:12:33,145
-Akutsu's just too good.

175
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:34,178
-Come on, Ryoma.

176
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,178
You can do it.

177
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,178
-Oh, Ryoma!

178
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:41,612
-Is that all you can do?

179
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:43,478
You are such a
disappointment to me, brat.

180
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,078
-Ryoma?

181
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:52,478
What's he just
standing there for?

182
00:12:52,512 --> 00:12:54,945
-Oh, Ryoma!

183
00:12:54,978 --> 00:12:55,945
JIN (VOICEOVER): Idiot.

184
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:57,278
Don't tell me you're scared.

185
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:02,645
-Way to go!

186
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:03,645
It's a short lob.

187
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:07,512
Oh, that's an easy one to smash.

188
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:08,345
-Look!

189
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:11,245
Echizen's suddenly on the move.

190
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:12,645
-I get it.

191
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:16,045
Echizen's narrowing the area in
which Akutsu can hit the ball.

192
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:17,345
-Huh?

193
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:19,178
INUI: When they're
both at the baseline,

194
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:21,745
they can return the
ball anywhere they like.

195
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:25,578
A short lob will draw Akutsu
in, and by approaching the net,

196
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:28,878
Echizen can limit where Akutsu
can hit the strong shot.

197
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:37,378
JIN (VOICEOVER): I see
you'e been thinking.

198
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:37,878
However--

199
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:48,712
-Oh, no.

200
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,712
He's gonna lob it over Echizen's
head for another point.

201
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:54,678
-Running away?

202
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:00,145
-You've got guts, kid.

203
00:14:00,178 --> 00:14:01,145
I'll give you that!

204
00:14:11,112 --> 00:14:11,578
-Wah!

205
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:19,045
-Oh, man.

206
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:19,745
-Wow.

207
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:20,912
-He totally dropped him.

208
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:21,978
-That's gotta hurt.

209
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:24,145
-I hope he's OK.

210
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:25,945
JIN (VOICEOVER):
That's quite a trick.

211
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:29,245
First he provoked me,
then he set me up.

212
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:29,745
Hm.

213
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:37,378
-30-15.

214
00:14:37,412 --> 00:14:38,778
-How'd he do that?

215
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:39,245
-Echizen?

216
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:45,845
-Hey, kid.

217
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:48,245
How long you going to
pretend to be asleep?

218
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:49,545
-Hey.

219
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:51,912
Didn't you say you wouldn't
let me win even one point?

220
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,545
I guess you lied, huh?

221
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:57,412
-Yippee!

222
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:58,445
Yeah, Ryoma!

223
00:14:58,478 --> 00:15:00,245
-We shouldn't have
worried about him!

224
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:01,978
He always finds a way to win!

225
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:03,112
-I get it.

226
00:15:03,145 --> 00:15:05,778
He deliberately provoked
him, and then moved up

227
00:15:05,812 --> 00:15:07,745
to the net so he'd be a target.

228
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:10,245
Echizen made him hit
it right at his face,

229
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:14,678
but he had his racket
positioned in advance.

230
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:16,145
-Still got a ways to go.

231
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:25,112
JIN (VOICEOVER):
That brat is more

232
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:27,312
interested in competing
than winning or losing.

233
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:39,578
-That one seems to have
the ideal tennis ability.

234
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,245
Mm-hm.

235
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:48,845
Like father, like son.

236
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:00,745
-He won the point,
but that strategy

237
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:03,845
won't work twice against
someone like Akutsu.

238
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:05,112
-No kidding.

239
00:16:05,145 --> 00:16:07,412
It doesn't change the fact
that he's still in trouble.

240
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:13,345
BOY (VOICEOVER): So, you nearly
kill yourself to win one point.

241
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:15,112
Oh, that's just like you.

242
00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:19,012
-Well, isn't this great?

243
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,912
-Huh?

244
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:22,312
-He's moving up again!

245
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:24,078
What's he trying
to do this time?

246
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:26,645
-If he can hit the
ball early, a return

247
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:29,945
is his only chance to
attack Akutsu, instead

248
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:31,978
of waiting to be
attacked by him.

249
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:33,045
It should work.

250
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:35,545
-Echizen has figured
it out for himself.

251
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,912
-Huh?

252
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:37,578
-The [inaudible].

253
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:44,278
-Huh?

254
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:45,278
He just hit the
Super Rising Shot.

255
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:53,812
BOY: Yikes!

256
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:55,978
Not even Akutsu will be
able to reach that one!

257
00:17:03,878 --> 00:17:04,378
-To the left!

258
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:08,845
-Trying to ace me, brat?

259
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:10,112
Don't make me laugh!

260
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:14,378
-Oh, no!

261
00:17:14,412 --> 00:17:18,078
He's gonna lose the point
on yet another passing shot!

262
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:22,478
-Sorry, son of Nanjiro, but
there's no stopping Akutsu now.

263
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:31,578
-Echizen, show me your
own kind of tennis.

264
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,312
Ryoma Echizen's tennis.

265
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:57,512
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): Dad?

266
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:13,378
-Take the next step, Echizen.

267
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:23,278
RYOMA (VOICEOVER):
I w be strong!

268
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:31,212
[shout]

269
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:52,312
-He actually changed
directions while in mid step.

270
00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:59,245
MAN (VOICEOVER): When someone
meets an overwhelming opponent,

271
00:18:59,278 --> 00:19:03,212
it's a chance to improve one's
skills and evolve as a player.

272
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:04,712
You're on your way.

273
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:09,178
Show us what you
can do, Echizen.

274
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:09,678
-40-30.

275
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:23,078
-If I'm not mistaken, he
just grew up a little.

276
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:30,812
[laughter]

277
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,245
-You see that?

278
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:41,545
Those two are laughing.

279
00:19:41,578 --> 00:19:46,278
-What on earth could
they be thinking about?

280
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:49,345
-Hey, you're gonna make a
great stepping stone for me.

281
00:20:15,178 --> 00:20:17,578
JIN (VOICEOVER):
I'm gonna crush you.

282
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:25,476
[theme music]

283
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:00,609
-Hello, everybody.

284
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:01,609
I'm Banda.

285
00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:03,509
Call me Banji.

286
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:07,376
Coach Ryuzaki, Ryoma's
potential is on the rise.

287
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:10,442
His one-legged split
step is amazing.

288
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:13,509
However, you have yet to
see the end of Akutsu.

289
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:16,542
He's got a reason why
he can't possibly lose.

290
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:19,976
Next on "The Prince of
Tennis," I Can't Lose.

291
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:22,176
Akutsu, now is the
time to let them

292
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:24,942
see a glimpse of your pride.
