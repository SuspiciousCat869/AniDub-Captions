1
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:11,909
-You're so strong willed,
it's kinda cute, you know?

2
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:12,876
-Ah!

3
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:14,309
Hm.

4
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:15,409
-Momoshiro?

5
00:00:15,443 --> 00:00:16,434
-What?

6
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:17,967
-Know how to play doubles?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,200
-Doubles?

8
00:00:19,234 --> 00:00:21,367
-If you're not interested--

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,200
[scoffs]

10
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:25,734
-No, that's where I'm strongest.

11
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:26,800
-Liar!

12
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:30,800
[theme music]

13
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:50,762
-Yes.

14
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:52,762
[grunting]

15
00:01:56,696 --> 00:01:58,213
-Oh, man.

16
00:01:58,213 --> 00:02:00,113
Practice is finally
over, and we have

17
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:01,880
to go out and shop for everyone.

18
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,013
-Why not?

19
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:05,580
This is part of the fun
of being on the team.

20
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:09,246
-It's hard enough on us, but
Ryoma, you must be really beat.

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,746
-You had to go through all
that exhausting training

22
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,613
with the regulars.

23
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:13,346
-Not really.

24
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,680
-Huh?

25
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:16,946
-He may be a regular, but he's
still a first year player.

26
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,146
He gets no special
treatment, because that's

27
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,513
the way we do it around here.

28
00:02:22,546 --> 00:02:25,446
-Ugh, that hurt.

29
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,446
[screams]

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:26,980
-Huh?

31
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,380
-Give it back!

32
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:29,313
Help!

33
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:30,713
Purse snatcher!

34
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:33,213
-A purse snatcher?

35
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:33,846
-Hey!

36
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,113
Get out of my way!

37
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:36,046
[screams]

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,113
-I'll get him!

39
00:02:37,146 --> 00:02:39,880
Ahhhhhhh!

40
00:02:39,913 --> 00:02:41,346
-Huh?

41
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,646
-Momoshiro's clothesline.

42
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,146
Ahhhhhh!

43
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:48,380
Missed him!

44
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:49,580
[screams]

45
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:50,446
-Help!

46
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,780
Get him, please!

47
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:52,646
He's got my bag!

48
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,013
-Shoot, I messed up.

49
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:55,846
Echizen, take care
of the shopping!

50
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,246
-Momoshiro, wait!

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,813
-It's dangerous!

52
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,946
-Wait up, you thief!

53
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,480
-What is with that guy?

54
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:05,646
-This is no good.

55
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,846
I can't catch up to
someone on roller skates.

56
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,380
Hm?

57
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:12,780
Sorry buddy, I got
to borrow your bike.

58
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:14,480
-Hey!

59
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:15,280
That's my bicycle!

60
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:17,480
[breathing heavily]

61
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:19,380
-That no good bike snatcher.

62
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:20,146
-Ah!

63
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,846
-You won't get away with it!

64
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,480
-Hey, that guy's familiar.

65
00:03:23,513 --> 00:03:25,446
-Do you think it could be--

66
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,313
-I'm rocking to the rhythm.

67
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:27,813
Hi-ya!

68
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:32,713
-Huh?

69
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,680
What?

70
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,013
It, it's Kamio from Fudoumine!

71
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:38,280
-Hi-ya!

72
00:03:38,313 --> 00:03:41,746
-He, he, he's gone!

73
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,680
I wonder if Momo's going
to be all right by himself.

74
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:45,780
-You know him.

75
00:03:45,813 --> 00:03:47,146
I don't think we'll
need to worry about it.

76
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,413
-Huh?

77
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:49,380
[screams]

78
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,713
-Oh.

79
00:03:53,746 --> 00:03:54,213
-Oh.

80
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,546
[smash]

81
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:29,313
-Oooooooh, oh no.

82
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:30,146
-Hello.

83
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,613
-Hi.

84
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:37,113
[breathing heavily]

85
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,513
-Hold it!

86
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:40,480
That's a Seigaku uniform, right?

87
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,813
Don't tell me you're Keido.

88
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:43,913
-Huh?

89
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:45,780
Don't confuse me with
that hissing idiot.

90
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:48,613
-Watching you play, I figured
you were pretty disagreeable,

91
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:51,380
but I didn't think
you were this rotten.

92
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:53,046
-I agree with you.

93
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,680
But I'm telling
you, I'm not Viper.

94
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:58,113
[breathing heavily]

95
00:04:58,146 --> 00:05:00,580
-You think you could
beat me at my rhythm?

96
00:05:00,613 --> 00:05:02,046
Well, let's see.

97
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,513
Come and catch me if you can!

98
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:04,980
-What's with those guys?

99
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:05,480
-Whoa!

100
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,913
-Uh!

101
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:08,813
Hey, out of the way!

102
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:09,813
-Ahhhh!

103
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:11,313
Ah!

104
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:12,813
-Ugh!

105
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:13,813
[growling]

106
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,313
-That was Viper.

107
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:16,813
Then, who are you?

108
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:19,813
-Open your eyes and
take a look, will you?

109
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:21,313
[breathing heavily]

110
00:05:21,346 --> 00:05:22,713
-Get out of the way!

111
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:23,746
Look out!

112
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,246
-Whoa!

113
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,746
Whoa!

114
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:28,613
-Oh!

115
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:29,946
Ooh, ugh.

116
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,613
-Oh, my bag!

117
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:33,713
-Hey, you there!

118
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:35,613
You'll come with me
to the police station.

119
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:36,913
-Huh?

120
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:37,480
-Aaaaaaaaahhhh!

121
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,213
-You, you're Momoshiro!

122
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:43,180
-You finally noticed?

123
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:45,546
Time to step up the rhythm.

124
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,813
-Hey, that's my line!

125
00:05:49,846 --> 00:05:50,713
GASP

126
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:51,280
-Aaaaaaaahhhh!

127
00:05:54,246 --> 00:05:55,946
-Don't underestimate me, Kamio.

128
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,880
The next corner's all mine.

129
00:05:57,913 --> 00:05:59,346
Street closed?

130
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,813
[screams]

131
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:05,746
[grunting]

132
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,080
-Watch it!

133
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:09,813
If you smash my bike, I'm
really going to give it to you!

134
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:11,646
-Hey, you kid!

135
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,846
Don't be ridiculous!

136
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,180
I've got the best reflexes
of anyone at Seigaku!

137
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:17,680
[laughing]

138
00:06:17,713 --> 00:06:20,413
-Hey, wasn't that
Momoshiro on a bike,

139
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,546
followed by Kamio
from Fudoumine?

140
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,346
-Huh, who'd he say had the
best reflexes at Seigaku?

141
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,280
[screams]

142
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:33,813
-No!

143
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:34,480
My bicycle!

144
00:06:34,513 --> 00:06:35,380
[crash]

145
00:06:35,413 --> 00:06:35,880
-Ow!

146
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:38,746
[thuds]

147
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,280
-Ow.

148
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:41,280
-Oh.

149
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:42,480
-Ow.

150
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:45,713
-So, you have the best
reflexes at Seigaku, huh?

151
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:47,980
-Don't say that.

152
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:49,880
[groans]

153
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:52,580
-Ah, welcome.

154
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,380
-Wait a second.

155
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,613
Hold on.

156
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:56,446
You mean you do all your
shopping here, too, Shinji?

157
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,946
-Gee, what a coincidence.

158
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,980
[laughs]

159
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:03,713
-Hey, it looks like they're
both angry with each other.

160
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:06,946
-He lost once to Ryoma, and I
don't think he's forgotten it.

161
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,180
-And Echizen himself
was hurt in that match.

162
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:15,013
-Ah, oh yeah, Echizen.

163
00:07:15,046 --> 00:07:16,080
-Huh?

164
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:17,946
-How's your injury?

165
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,513
-Oh, it's fine.

166
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:20,446
-They talked?

167
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,613
-Did they make up
with each other?

168
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:25,746
-It can't be possible.

169
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,680
-Hm.

170
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:29,180
-Hm.

171
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:34,046
-Ha, ha!

172
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,880
I've never seen
friends this gloomy.

173
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,913
-Oh, Momoshiro, where are you?

174
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:41,880
Please hurry back?

175
00:07:41,913 --> 00:07:43,613
[hiss]

176
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:46,546
-Hey, I'm real sorry about
what happened there, kid.

177
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,280
-I'm so sorry, too.

178
00:07:48,313 --> 00:07:49,813
Didn't I tell you
the purse snatcher

179
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:52,413
was wearing roller skates,
a t-shirt and a cap?

180
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:55,913
And he was older, and not nearly
as young and cute as that boy.

181
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:58,880
[groans]

182
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:04,546
-What in the--?

183
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,013
You didn't tell me you were
after a purse snatcher.

184
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:08,813
-It should have
been obvious to you.

185
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:11,046
Tell me, why would I
steal somebody's bike?

186
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,846
-Yeah, but the purse snatcher
still got away from you.

187
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,313
[groans]

188
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:22,180
-Well, Viper was there, so my
guess is that things probably

189
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:23,113
worked out all right.

190
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:23,713
-Huh?

191
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:24,980
What does that mean?

192
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,913
Looks like it's not broken.

193
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:34,746
-By the way, how's the
Fudoumine tennis team doing?

194
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,646
-We'll never lose
to Seigaku again.

195
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,280
Anyway, aren't you
a bench warmer?

196
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:40,880
-Idiot, I'm no bench warmer.

197
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:43,180
It just so happened
on that day--

198
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:44,880
-What? let me go, will you?

199
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:45,980
-Huh?

200
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:47,080
-That voice!

201
00:08:47,113 --> 00:08:49,780
-It does sound sort of familiar.

202
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:50,813
Huh?

203
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:52,513
Hey, isn't this the place--

204
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:53,013
-No!

205
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:55,180
Let me go!

206
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:58,713
-Now, now, don't
put up such a fuss.

207
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,813
You already promised, remember?

208
00:09:00,846 --> 00:09:04,646
If we beat everyone, you
go out on a date with me.

209
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,246
Isn't that right?

210
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,780
-Grr.

211
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:10,413
-So it is on.

212
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:12,246
-Hey, isn't that
Tachibana's sister?

213
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,446
[grunts]

214
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,613
-Huh?

215
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:16,046
-Gyokarin?

216
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,813
-Momoshiro.

217
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:19,046
-What's this?

218
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,746
We've got two more of them.

219
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,746
[grunting]

220
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,746
-An, what's going on here?

221
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,213
-These guys are bullying
the amateur players.

222
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:29,746
-You're talking about
that bunch of losers?

223
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,346
-Ah!

224
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,913
-You're so strong willed.

225
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:35,680
It's kind of cute, you know?

226
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:36,580
[gasps]

227
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:38,280
-Hm.

228
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:39,413
-Momoshiro?

229
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,480
-What?

230
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,013
-Know how to play doubles?

231
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:43,280
-Doubles?

232
00:09:43,313 --> 00:09:46,013
-If you're not interested--

233
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:49,813
-No, that's where I'm strongest.

234
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:51,080
-Liar!

235
00:09:51,113 --> 00:09:53,246
-Uh, uh?

236
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,480
-Fine with me.

237
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:55,980
Bring everybody on.

238
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,380
What do you think, Kibachi?

239
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:58,980
-Yes.

240
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:01,246
-Gyokarin, lend me your racquet.

241
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,113
-Uh, OK.

242
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:05,146
Listen, are you sure
you'll be all right?

243
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,413
-Don't worry.

244
00:10:06,446 --> 00:10:08,246
Come out, relax buddy.

245
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,046
I played you twice already, so
you should know how good I am.

246
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,546
Ha!

247
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,046
Ha!

248
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,813
-Idiot.

249
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,880
That's why I'm asking you.

250
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:16,980
-Hm, you're using
a good racquet.

251
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:18,113
-Be careful with it!

252
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:19,946
It was expensive.

253
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,780
-I'm sorry to get the
two of you involved.

254
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:22,946
[whack]

255
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,046
-Uh.

256
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,813
-It's nice that you're so brave,
but take it easy, will you?

257
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:29,246
-Uh.

258
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,646
Oh.

259
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,780
-Grr.

260
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:34,013
You're acting a little
too familiar with her.

261
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:36,546
-Well, I guess you can say
I'm what they call lovable.

262
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:46,546
-Darn it.

263
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,813
[chewing] That nomo.

264
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:51,613
Who's the best at Seigaku?

265
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:53,346
[laughs]

266
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,980
-You're still harping on that?

267
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:56,213
But isn't it strange?

268
00:10:56,246 --> 00:10:58,180
Momoshiro was supposed
to be out shopping

269
00:10:58,213 --> 00:10:59,413
with Echizen and the guys.

270
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:00,113
[scream]

271
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:00,680
-Huh?

272
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:02,080
-Purse snatcher!

273
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:02,880
-Purse snatcher?

274
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:14,648
-Thank you for shopping here.

275
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:15,915
Here's your receipt.

276
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:17,115
-Thank you.

277
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:19,082
-Good luck in the
Metropolitan tournament.

278
00:11:19,115 --> 00:11:20,548
-Thank you very much, sir.

279
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:22,715
-I truly hope no one
gets hurt this time.

280
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:23,215
-Ah!

281
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:31,382
-But, there's nothing happening.

282
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:33,448
I mean, maybe it's
all right now.

283
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:35,882
Maybe there's no need
for us to be so cautious.

284
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:36,682
[screams]

285
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:38,515
-Here it is.

286
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:39,882
-Huh?

287
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:40,382
-Huh?

288
00:11:44,648 --> 00:11:46,015
Let me have it.

289
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:46,915
-No way.

290
00:11:46,948 --> 00:11:48,282
[screams]

291
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:51,548
-Something's finally happening!

292
00:11:51,582 --> 00:11:52,048
-Stop!

293
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:53,015
Thief!

294
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:54,948
Give me back my bag!

295
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,615
-My strong point is I don't
give up after one failure.

296
00:11:57,648 --> 00:11:58,548
-This looks dangerous!

297
00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:00,048
I think we'd better leave now.

298
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:01,582
-Here, Taka, hold this racquet.

299
00:12:01,615 --> 00:12:03,582
-Huh?

300
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:04,948
[grunts]

301
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:06,882
-Justice!

302
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:09,848
I will uphold
peace in this town!

303
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:10,848
Take that!

304
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:11,782
-Aaaaah!

305
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:12,748
That's my racquet!

306
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:13,248
-Whoa!

307
00:12:16,615 --> 00:12:22,348
[breathing heavily]

308
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:23,448
[breathing heavily]

309
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:24,815
-Huh?

310
00:12:24,848 --> 00:12:26,048
Ow!

311
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:26,548
Ah!

312
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:28,048
Oh!

313
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:29,015
[thud]

314
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,015
-Uh!

315
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,015
Uh.

316
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:32,582
Uhhh.

317
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:34,515
-Stop, criminal!

318
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:36,082
-Wait, Taka, that's my racquet!

319
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:39,348
[growling]

320
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:41,682
[hiss]

321
00:12:41,715 --> 00:12:43,215
-Thanks again, young man.

322
00:12:43,248 --> 00:12:46,615
-Oh, and I would like
to thank you as well.

323
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:48,782
-Yeah, it's unusual to come
across a good young man

324
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:49,282
like that.

325
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:50,215
-Oh, yes.

326
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:51,748
He'll grow up to
be quite handsome.

327
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:55,348
[groans]

328
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:57,615
-Oh, oh, I'm sorry Eiji.

329
00:12:57,648 --> 00:12:59,015
-Never mind.

330
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:01,348
I was probably going to restring
it in the near future anyway.

331
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:02,715
-Ooooh!

332
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:03,682
Oh!

333
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:05,748
Eiji, Takashi,
good, it's you guys!

334
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:20,515
-Let me have it.

335
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:21,448
-No way.

336
00:13:21,482 --> 00:13:23,415
-I said, let me have it.

337
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:25,348
-Like I said, no way.

338
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:27,982
-No. [sighs] I'm telling
you, let me have it.

339
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,548
-I said no, so no.

340
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:30,782
-You're such a pain.

341
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:32,382
Let me have it, will you?

342
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:33,548
-Oh my goodness!

343
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:36,615
That's a popular brand,
and I only have one left!

344
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:38,215
-What's going on here?

345
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:41,648
-Kikumaru, please stop those two
before something awful happens!

346
00:13:41,682 --> 00:13:42,348
[gasps]

347
00:13:47,548 --> 00:13:48,882
[gasps]

348
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:49,748
-Yeah!

349
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:51,682
Echizen, for the
sake of Seigaku,

350
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:54,182
you must never, ever, back down!

351
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:55,282
[screams]

352
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:56,082
-What's he doing?

353
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:57,815
-That's fuel on the fire!

354
00:13:57,848 --> 00:13:59,148
-Don't say that!

355
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:02,115
If Tezuka or Coach Ryuzaki
finds out, we've had it!

356
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:03,715
-But we're going up
against Fudoumean,

357
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:05,515
at the Metropolitan matches.

358
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:08,182
If we lose now, it
won't look good.

359
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,648
Go Ryoma!

360
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,748
Oh.

361
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:13,615
-You don't have to tell me that.

362
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:15,282
-Don't have to tell me, either.

363
00:14:19,882 --> 00:14:21,015
-Thank you very much.

364
00:14:21,048 --> 00:14:22,648
Come again.

365
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:24,948
-Anyway, we'll bother
everyone in the store

366
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:26,782
so we should settle
this somewhere else,

367
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,048
don't you think?

368
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:31,715
-Oh, I wonder when Momoshiro's
going to get back here.

369
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:32,315
-Momo?

370
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:33,315
I just saw him.

371
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:34,582
-Huh?

372
00:14:34,615 --> 00:14:36,948
-He was running towards the
tennis courts with Kamio.

373
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:38,182
-You don't think that, uh--

374
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:39,582
-Those rivals?

375
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,648
-Yeah, they may be
facing off, too.

376
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:42,482
[gasps]

377
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:43,648
[sighs]

378
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:52,815
-Hey, you sure you don't
mind playing forward?

379
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:53,748
-No.

380
00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:55,682
Either way, it'll
be an easy win.

381
00:14:55,715 --> 00:14:57,448
-That's what you think.

382
00:14:57,482 --> 00:14:59,448
You have no reason
to be so confident.

383
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,048
-Hey, An, don't
you think it would

384
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:03,082
be better if you were
to disappear now?

385
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:04,282
-I can't do that.

386
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:06,182
This is all my fault.

387
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:08,948
-He's that really strong
guy we saw the other day!

388
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:10,915
-Hey, we're counting on you!

389
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:16,348
-I'll let you guys
have the serve.

390
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,715
It's too tiring, so
we'll just play one game.

391
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:20,348
Right, Kibachi?

392
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:21,282
-Yeah.

393
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:21,782
-Huh?

394
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:31,648
-Darn, the big guy's
planning to play alone again.

395
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,715
-Yeah.

396
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:35,282
They definitely have
an attitude problem.

397
00:15:35,315 --> 00:15:37,048
-Oh.

398
00:15:37,082 --> 00:15:39,482
-Shall we show
them we're serious?

399
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:41,482
-Yeah.

400
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:42,215
[grunts]

401
00:15:42,248 --> 00:15:42,715
-Uh!

402
00:15:46,148 --> 00:15:47,015
-Hwa!

403
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:47,648
-He's fast.

404
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:48,582
-Shoot.

405
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,582
He's big, but he moves quick.

406
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:52,482
[grunts]

407
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:54,648
-That ball went right past him.

408
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:58,682
-What, is it the end
of the game already?

409
00:15:58,715 --> 00:16:01,715
-Hey, Momoshiro, are you
sure you're good at doubles,

410
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:03,515
because I'm stepping
up the rhythm.

411
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:04,882
[grunts]

412
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:11,248
-Get it, Kibachi.

413
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:12,382
-OK.

414
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:13,215
[grunts]

415
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:14,182
[gasps]

416
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:15,582
-He got that ball
from the baseline.

417
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,615
Way to go, Kamio!

418
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:20,582
Now's our chance!

419
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:21,082
-Raaaa!

420
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:26,648
-(THOUGHT) An overhead smash?

421
00:16:26,682 --> 00:16:27,148
-Ha!

422
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:35,182
-(THOUGHT) That guy's doing
his best to get me riled up.

423
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:35,682
-Kibachi.

424
00:16:35,715 --> 00:16:37,082
-OK.

425
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:38,048
[grunts]

426
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:40,448
[grunts]

427
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:40,948
-Uh!

428
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:45,282
[gasps]

429
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:46,415
-Ah, Momoshiro!

430
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,048
-What the?

431
00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:58,782
-Amazing!

432
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:00,115
His persistent paid off!

433
00:17:00,148 --> 00:17:02,015
[breathing heavily]

434
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:03,548
-Forget it, Kibachi.

435
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:04,782
-Oh.

436
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,215
-That's enough.

437
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:10,582
[bouncing ball]

438
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:13,415
-We'll let you win
the game today.

439
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:15,048
And what's your name?

440
00:17:15,082 --> 00:17:18,082
-Seigaku eighth grader,
Takeshi Momoshiro.

441
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:19,648
And what about you?

442
00:17:19,682 --> 00:17:22,815
-Hyoutei Academy ninth
grader, Keigo Atobe.

443
00:17:22,848 --> 00:17:23,782
-Wait a minute!

444
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:25,782
I'm Fudoumean eighth
grader, Kamio!

445
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:26,982
-I don't remember asking.

446
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,515
Did I?

447
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,482
-Why that--

448
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,415
-Kamio, don't let
it get you down.

449
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:32,415
-Shut up!

450
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:34,582
It's your fault
because you messed up!

451
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:37,448
-Thanks to both of you, you
were a really big help to me.

452
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:40,282
-It was a tough battle with
my partner being so bad.

453
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:41,848
-You're really making me angry!

454
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:43,415
[laughs]

455
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:45,782
-(THOUGHT) So, he's
from Hyoutei Academy,

456
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,948
the number one seed in
the Metropolitan matches.

457
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:54,482
-So how are we going to decide?

458
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:55,815
-Tennis, I guess.

459
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:56,782
-What?

460
00:17:56,815 --> 00:17:58,182
-You're going to have a match?

461
00:17:58,215 --> 00:18:02,115
-OK, but the loser has to guzzle
down a Newie's vegetable drink.

462
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,215
-No way.

463
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,082
[laughs]

464
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:05,015
-What is that?

465
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:06,682
-You don't want to know.

466
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:08,482
-Hm.

467
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:09,482
Huh?

468
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:12,082
[nervous laughter]

469
00:18:12,115 --> 00:18:12,648
[scream]

470
00:18:12,682 --> 00:18:14,315
-Purse snatcher!

471
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:15,448
-Huh?

472
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:17,148
-If at first you don't
succeed, then you better

473
00:18:17,182 --> 00:18:18,382
get out of my way!

474
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:19,548
-Hey, that's the guy!

475
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:21,915
-All right, tell
you what-- whoever

476
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:23,248
catches him is the winner.

477
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:24,515
Got it, you two?

478
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:25,015
-Hm.

479
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:30,415
-Service, Seigaku and Fudoumean.

480
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:32,082
[blows whistle]

481
00:18:32,115 --> 00:18:33,448
-Ah.

482
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:34,848
[grunts]

483
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:35,915
-Oh!

484
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,282
Whoa!

485
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:38,548
Ah!

486
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:39,048
Oh!

487
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:43,182
-Ah!

488
00:18:43,215 --> 00:18:44,148
-He did it!

489
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:45,882
-Wow, we almost
kick serve hit him!

490
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:47,015
[groaning]

491
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:50,648
[breathing heavily]

492
00:18:50,682 --> 00:18:51,582
-Ah!

493
00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:52,548
Uh.

494
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:53,982
Ah.

495
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:56,215
-It's all over!

496
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:58,582
Game to Echizen of Seigaku.

497
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:00,615
-Well, I guess that's that.

498
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:02,282
[sighs]

499
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:05,715
-Now, let's go
quietly to the police.

500
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:07,848
-Huh?

501
00:19:07,882 --> 00:19:08,415
-Kaidoh?

502
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:12,582
[growling ]

503
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:14,148
-You're a real mess!

504
00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:16,482
Were you doing some of
your secret training?

505
00:19:16,515 --> 00:19:19,082
-Why you little punk!

506
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:20,048
-Be careful with it.

507
00:19:20,082 --> 00:19:21,415
-Kaidoh, stop it!

508
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:22,748
-Hm?

509
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:23,382
-Hey, guys!

510
00:19:23,415 --> 00:19:24,782
Sorry I'm so late.

511
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,182
-Hey, Momoshiro!

512
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:28,348
[struggling]

513
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:31,382
-Hey, Momo, who did you say
has the best reflexes of anyone

514
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:32,248
at Seigaku, huh?

515
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:33,048
Huh?

516
00:19:33,082 --> 00:19:33,748
Huh?

517
00:19:33,782 --> 00:19:34,582
-What?

518
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:37,015
-I'm impressed, Echizen.

519
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:38,182
-Huh?

520
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:40,415
-It will go so easy in the
Metropolitan tournament.

521
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:41,215
-What?

522
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,282
-You better remember that.

523
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:42,982
-Ah!

524
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,182
He's muttering again!

525
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:47,015
-Anyway, you're too lucky
for a seventh grader,

526
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:48,848
and it makes me mad.

527
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:49,482
We may--

528
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:50,648
-Ah!

529
00:19:50,682 --> 00:19:53,415
-Easy now, Kikumaru,
just calm down.

530
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:54,382
-Aaaaaah!

531
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:55,382
-Kayo.

532
00:19:55,415 --> 00:19:57,815
-You, don't do it!

533
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:58,748
-I'm sorry.

534
00:19:58,782 --> 00:19:59,748
I'll never do it again!

535
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:00,682
-Hey, you, jump
behind behind Takashi.

536
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:01,515
-Oh!

537
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:03,848
-I said stop it, Kaidoh!

538
00:20:03,882 --> 00:20:05,515
Will you stop, Kaidoh?

539
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:06,348
Ah!

540
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:08,182
-I never said that.

541
00:20:08,215 --> 00:20:08,982
-Yes, you did.

542
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:10,582
I heard you.

543
00:20:10,615 --> 00:20:13,648
-Hey, Momoshiro,
can I go home now?

544
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:15,548
[sighs]

545
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:16,348
-Huh?

546
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,848
We still have a ways to go.

547
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:20,648
But, I'm sorry for what happened
at that last tournament.

548

[theme music]

549
00:20:55,177 --> 00:20:58,277
-Hello, I'm Saori Shiva.

550
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,243
The Seigaku boys are
practicing harder and harder.

551
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:04,310
I can just imagine
how awful it must be.

552
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:07,077
On top of that, they have
to drink a new veggie

553
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,177
drink developed by
Enui-- Tazuka, too.

554
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,010
Mr. Inui, let me go
and cover the story.
