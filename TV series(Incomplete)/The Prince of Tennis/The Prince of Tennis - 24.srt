1
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:10,506
-That's it, good serve.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,306
Return it.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,573
Good shot.

4
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:13,940
Oh, this is great.

5
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:16,103
Hey, your backhand
is improving, man.

6
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:17,070
-Hey, grandma.

7
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:18,537
We meet at 2 o'clock
tomorrow, right?

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,003
I'm just making sure.

9
00:00:21,037 --> 00:00:22,203
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

10
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:24,670
I'm afraid I can't go
with you tomorrow at all.

11
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:25,637
-What?

12
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,870
-Well, I forgot.

13
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:29,237
There's some important work
I have to do on Sunday.

14
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,570
-But if you can't go,
who's going to introduce me

15
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:34,370
to the man who is going to
restring my racquet for me?

16
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:36,070
-Good question.

17
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:36,570
Huh.

18
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,203
Ryoma, can you
come here a minute?

19
00:00:43,237 --> 00:00:44,470
Are you free tomorrow?

20
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:45,870
-Why?

21
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:48,803
-Sakuno's strings of are pretty
loose, and you know him right?

22
00:00:48,837 --> 00:00:50,103
Old Man Haritatsu.

23
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:52,103
I was going to take
Sakuno over to his shop

24
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:54,537
to get her racquet restrung.

25
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,803
-And so?

26
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:57,070
-Well, I can't go.

27
00:00:57,103 --> 00:01:00,037
So I was wondering if I
could ask you to take Sakuno.

28
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,870
-But, Grandma--

29
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:04,103
-I don't exactly get
along with that old man.

30
00:01:04,137 --> 00:01:04,970
-Oh, come on.

31
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:05,970
Please take her?

32
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:07,303
-I, uh--

33
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:09,403
-You wouldn't want to turn
down a desperate young lady

34
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:11,637
in her time of
need, now would you?

35
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,703
-Oh-- I-- I'd really
appreciate it.

36
00:01:15,737 --> 00:01:16,903
-Well, OK.

37
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:17,570
I guess.

38
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:18,203
-Great.

39
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:19,437
I'm counting on you.

40
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,103
Tomorrow at 2 o'clock at
the station ticket window.

41
00:01:23,137 --> 00:01:26,603
[theme music]

42
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,907
-Oh.

43
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,707
Oh.

44
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,960
SAKUNO (VOICEOVER): Sakuno
Riuzaki, you're officially now

45
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:49,727
in big trouble.

46
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,860
Oh, what am I going to do?

47
00:02:51,894 --> 00:02:53,227
I can't decide that to wear.

48
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:58,994
Only 15 minutes left
until 2 o'clock.

49
00:02:59,027 --> 00:02:59,860
Oh--

50
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:01,627
[phone ringing]

51
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,127
-Oh.

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,427
Uh, hello?

53
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,260
The Riuzakis.

54
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:09,127
-Hey, Sakuno.

55
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,994
It's me, Tamoka.

56
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:10,760
How are you?

57
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:11,827
Are you free today?

58
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,194
Can you come over and hang out?

59
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,127
I have to watch
over my brothers.

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,094
Huh?

61
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:18,394
Restringing?

62
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:19,694
Oh, your tennis racquet.

63
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:22,460
-Yes, and, uh-- that's not all.

64
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,560
-Uh-huh, and with Ryoma?

65
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:29,794
Huh?

66
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:30,760
What?

67
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:31,560
No way!

68
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:33,560
You have a date with Ryoma?

69
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:35,060
-It's not a date, Tamoka.

70
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:38,027
My grandmother is practically
forcing him to take me.

71
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,360
-Sakuno, you little sneak.

72
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:41,794
I want to go with
you and Ryoma, too!

73
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:42,794
Awww!

74
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:44,294
-I'm telling you.

75
00:03:44,327 --> 00:03:45,294
It's not a date!

76
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,227
-I am starved.

77
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,527
Hey there, young fella.

78
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,460
Where you going?

79
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:54,427
Out on a date?

80
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,194
-Just going to
restring a racquet.

81
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:58,160
-Now, that's very unusual.

82
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:01,094
Why would you want to go all the
way down to Haritatsu's shop?

83
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:04,194
-I have to take Coach
Riuzaki's granddaughter.

84
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:05,960
-What's this about
a granddaughter?

85
00:04:05,994 --> 00:04:07,360
I knew it was a date.

86
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:08,560
Haha.

87
00:04:08,594 --> 00:04:11,794
So, my son has finally grown
into a man at last, huh?

88
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:13,660
Your daddy's happy to hear it.

89
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:15,794
-We're only going to have
her racquet restrung.

90
00:04:15,827 --> 00:04:20,127
-OK, make sure you have fun
so you don't have any regrets.

91
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,327
So he's finally going
out on his first date.

92
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,627
Hold it.

93
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,527
Does he even know anything
about how to take a girl out?

94
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
I got to see this myself.

95
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,860
-Oh-- Oh, no.

96
00:04:47,894 --> 00:04:48,860
I'm going to be late.

97
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:55,260
Oh-- Oh.

98
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,660
Oh.

99
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:04,760
Oh.

100
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:06,660
-Haritatsu's place is this way.

101
00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:08,627
-Oh, I'm sorry I'm so late.

102
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,527
You must have
waited a long time.

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,027
Oh.

104
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,960
SAKUNO (VOICEOVER): Oh, dear.

105
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:21,460
I knew it.

106
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:22,460
He's angry.

107
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:25,394
I was 30 minutes late.

108
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:25,894
Oh--

109
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:31,327
-You're still green, Ryoma.

110
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,894
You'll never be a
man if you can't

111
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:37,094
learn to forgive a girl
for being a little late.

112
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:38,894
-Oh, what's the matter
with that priest?

113
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:42,227
-He seems weird.

114
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,660
-Thanks so much for a
great day today, Momo.

115
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:47,394
-Thanks to you, we learned a
lot about how to pick out shoes.

116
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:50,360
-Yeah, and you treat us
to a delicious lunch, too.

117
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:54,460
-Yeah, it's the least I can
do as your upperclassman.

118
00:05:54,494 --> 00:05:55,827
-Huh?

119
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,260
-Hey, it's Echizen.

120
00:05:57,294 --> 00:05:57,860
-You're right.

121
00:05:57,894 --> 00:05:59,094
It's Ryoma.

122
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:01,660
And he's with Sakuno.

123
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,460
-Do you think it's a date?

124
00:06:03,494 --> 00:06:04,660
-I don't know.

125
00:06:04,694 --> 00:06:05,427
I guess so.

126
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,494
-Oh, man, there's no way.

127
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:07,594
Lucky guy.

128
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:09,094
I'm jealous.

129
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,294
-No joke?

130
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:12,327
So those two have a little
romantic thing going on,

131
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,460
do they?

132
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:15,894
Ahh, the wonderful joys
of youthful pursuits.

133
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:16,994
I know what we can do.

134
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:17,760
-Huh?

135
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,027
-Let's follow them, guys.

136
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,227
-Yeah, but Momoshiro, you
sure have lots of time.

137
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:36,027
-Oh.

138
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,094
-Come on, now.

139
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:39,027
At least take her hand
and hold it close.

140
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,227
-All right.

141
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,560
-Well, I didn't mean the
two of you, but all right.

142
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:44,827
Why don't you two go for it?

143
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,327
-Huh?

144
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:49,394
-Hmm.

145
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:50,660
-I wonder where they're going.

146
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:51,660
Maybe to a movie.

147
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:53,460
[laughter]

148
00:06:53,494 --> 00:06:56,227
-Echizen doesn't know the
first thing about anything.

149
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,427
[humming]

150
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,094
[mumbling]

151
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:04,260
-What's the matter
with that guy?

152
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:04,960
Hey,

153
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:06,060
-I know that priest.

154
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:07,960
He's the one who
discriminates against women.

155
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,094
-Against women?

156
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:09,727
-Let's go.

157
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:17,260
-I've never been to this
part of town before.

158
00:07:17,294 --> 00:07:21,794
There are lots of sporting
good shops around here.

159
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:23,894
I wonder if the man
who strings racquets

160
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,460
works in a place like this.

161
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:26,027
Does he?

162
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,260
R-- Ryoma?

163
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:28,927
-Over here.

164
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,460
-Oh.

165
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:30,894
Wait for me!

166
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,094
-That boy sure
doesn't talk much.

167
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:37,960
Huh.

168
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:39,894
Ramen noodles.

169
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,327
Now that I think
of it, I haven't

170
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,994
had a single,
solitary bite to eat.

171
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:45,594
-Hey, you.

172
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:46,394
-Who are you?

173
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:48,160
-I knew I'd seen you before.

174
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:51,860
You better tell us why you're
following those two around.

175
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:54,660
-Oh, I'm sorry, I
no speak Japanese.

176
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:55,960
-Cut the act.

177
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,627
No one is going to believe
a Buddhist priest pretending

178
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,360
to be a foreigner.

179
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,427
-Ah!

180
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,794
-Huh?

181
00:08:04,827 --> 00:08:06,927
-Aww, he's gone.

182
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,594
-Suspicious.

183
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:10,127
-What's up with that guy?

184
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,194
-I know.

185
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:13,427
It must be Sakuno who
he's really stalking.

186
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,594
-Huh?

187
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,194
-That no-good scum.

188
00:08:16,227 --> 00:08:17,127
Now hear this.

189
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,060
We have to protect
Echizen's date.

190
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:19,727
-Huh?

191
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,894
-You with me?

192
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:22,060
-Well, yes.

193
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,560
-This is it.

194
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,594
Old man Haritatsu's.

195
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:37,127
-This building?

196
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,960
This is it?

197
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:40,194
-What's wrong?

198
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,227
-Oh, well, nothing.

199
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,094
It's just not quite
as I imagined it.

200
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:44,127
-Why not?

201
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,294
-Well, it's kind of
hard to say, really.

202
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,227
I've never had my
racquet restrung before,

203
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,594
but I thought it would
be a nicer looking place.

204
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:03,394
-They went into that grubby
looking shop over that way.

205
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:04,727
-Where's the stalker?

206
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,794
-There's no sign of him.

207
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:06,327
-Hmm.

208
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,394
Weird, huh?

209
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:09,594
This seems a little
bizarre for a date.

210
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:10,827
-I wonder what they're doing.

211
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:17,427
[traffic noises]

212
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:26,960
-Anyone around here?

213
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:30,994
-Oh--

214
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,894
-I welcome you.

215
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:43,160
-Oh-- oh--

216
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:48,947
-Well, well.

217
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,047
If it isn't little Ryoma.

218
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,047
I haven't seen you in ages.

219
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,214
And how's Nonjiro getting along?

220
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:56,747
-I guess he's doing all right.

221
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,780
[laughter]

222
00:09:57,814 --> 00:09:59,180
-I'm glad to hear it.

223
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:02,347
Please give him my fondest
regards when you get home.

224
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,614
Who's this young lady?

225
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,814
What a nice girl
you have with you.

226
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:08,147
It is a great pleasure
to meet you, miss.

227
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,714
I am Tatsugoru, a specialist
in restringing racquets.

228
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:14,380
People call me Haritatsu,
hari, as in needle.

229
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,647
-Oh, oh, um, yes, I'm
happy to meet you too.

230
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,547
My name is Riuzaki.

231
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,147
-Riuzaki?

232
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,980
Huh.

233
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:22,547
You must be related to Sumire.

234
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,380
-Yes.

235
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,580
I'm her granddaughter Sakuno.

236
00:10:24,614 --> 00:10:26,947
-Well, this really
is a happy occasion.

237
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,614
Please, come on in
the back and sit down.

238
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:33,314
Ryoma's dad and Sumire
have favored me for years.

239
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:35,780
And even though I
haven't seen him in ages,

240
00:10:35,814 --> 00:10:38,880
I still occasionally get
word about Ryoma's latest

241
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:40,814
accomplishments on
the tennis court.

242
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,147
-Oh.

243
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,880
[laughter]

244
00:10:43,914 --> 00:10:44,980
-Young lady.

245
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:46,647
You think Ryoma's a
strong tennis player?

246
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,947
-He's amazing.

247
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,780
-Yes, but in my view, his
game is still child's play.

248
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:53,547
He needs to keep working
hard on it to get better.

249
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,214
And become more like Nonji.

250
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:57,147
-No, I'm not going
to be like him.

251
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,680
-Uh--

252
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:01,514
[laughter]

253
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:03,580
-I've heard that
until my ears hurt.

254
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:04,880
-Never mind all that.

255
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:10,347
-Uh-- Yes, I'd like you to
restring my racquet, please.

256
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,814
-And just what do we have here?

257
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:13,314
Hmm.

258
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,514
Young lady, I can
see that you try

259
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,680
to hit the ball as hard
as you possibly can.

260
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:26,047
But you have difficulty
hitting the sweet spot.

261
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,914
-Huh?

262
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:28,747
How can you possibly tell that?

263
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,047
-Not to worry.

264
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,347
I'll adjust the thickness
and tension of the strings

265
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,447
so your hand becomes
more sensitive to what

266
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,447
the ball does on your racquet.

267
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,914
-Oh, thank you.

268
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:47,880
ANNOUNCER: Well,
we've finally come

269
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:50,847
to the finals of the All
Japan Tennis Championships.

270
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,847
Today will be the
men's singles finals.

271
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,447
This is going to be a battle
between two of the greatest

272
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,814
rivals in the present-day
Japan tennis world.

273
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:01,214
We hope they'll soon gain
international recognition.

274
00:12:01,247 --> 00:12:05,014
-Ryoma, you probably don't know
this, but Nonji at his peak

275
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:08,980
was one of the strongest
tennis pros ever.

276
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:12,180
Power, speed, great
reflexes-- and he

277
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:14,380
amazed the crowd with
his flawless play.

278
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:18,047
He retired so suddenly, but
after his debut as a pro,

279
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,947
he played 37 tournaments the
world over and won them all.

280
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,647
He truly shook the tennis world.

281
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,580
SAKUNO (VOICEOVER): I
wonder who this Nonji is.

282
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,014
Could he be Ryoma's father?

283
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,747
-Shoot.

284
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,847
That won't even pay
for a bowl of noodles.

285
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,847
Man, am I starving.

286
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,014
Maybe old man
Haritatsu will give me

287
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:42,347
something I can
put in my stomach.

288
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,880
-Young lady, this is
going to take a while.

289
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:46,280
So why don't the
two of you go out

290
00:12:46,314 --> 00:12:49,047
for a nice little walk
around the neighborhood?

291
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,947
-Let's go.

292
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,147
-Huh?

293
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,380
-Ryoma, did you want your
racquet restrung too?

294
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:54,580
-No, thank you.

295
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:55,680
-What?

296
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:57,780
But then why did you
bring it along with you?

297
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,547
-They finally came out.

298
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,880
-Where are they going now?

299
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:12,614
-All right.

300
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:13,347
Let's follow them.

301
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:21,347
-Man.

302
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,080
The district matches
were so exciting.

303
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:24,014
-I'll say.

304
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:26,047
Especially that
seventh-grade kid.

305
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,714
-Huh?

306
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:27,614
What's this you say?

307
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:28,847
Was he really that good?

308
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,180
-Yeah.

309
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:32,414
In the finals he got hurt
and one eye was swollen shut,

310
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:35,114
but he still won the
match in just 10 minutes.

311
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,880
-On top of that,
he defeated the guy

312
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:38,780
who beat Kuki from Kakenoki.

313
00:13:38,814 --> 00:13:39,980
He was terrific.

314
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:40,947
-Wow.

315
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,380
So you're saying
it only took him

316
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:44,247
10 minutes to win the match?

317
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,214
And what was the name of
this remarkable seventh-grade

318
00:13:47,247 --> 00:13:48,047
player?

319
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,214
-What was the name of that kid?

320
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:50,314
I can't remember.

321
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:51,547
-It was Echizen.

322
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,647
Ryoma Echizen.

323
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,014
-Yeah, yeah, that's it.

324
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,314
Ryoma Echizen.

325
00:13:55,347 --> 00:13:55,814
-Hmm.

326
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:08,014
-I wonder if he will catch
up to his legendary father.

327
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,380
-Hey, Ryoma.

328
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,714
Thanks for bringing me.

329
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:11,680
-No problem.

330
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:12,780
-Mmm.

331
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:15,180
That Haritatsu is a
very interesting man.

332
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:18,047
-Yeah?

333
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,580
SAKUNO (VOICEOVER) I can't
even get a conversation going.

334
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:28,080
-That idiot son of mine.

335
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:29,214
How could he?

336
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:30,914
Boring a pretty
young girl like that.

337
00:14:30,947 --> 00:14:33,047
When's he going to learn
that playing tennis isn't

338
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,147
all there is to life?

339
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,247
-Gee, you know,
it really doesn't

340
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,647
look like they're on a date.

341
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,447
Echizen keeps walking farther
and farther ahead of her.

342
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,247
-Nah, that's just
the way Echizen is.

343
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,314
Always aloof.

344
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:46,747
But he sure doesn't
know the first thing

345
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,647
about how to treat
a pretty girl.

346
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,347
I'm going to go tell him
me has to be nicer to her.

347
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,214
-No, Momo.

348
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:53,047
You can't interfere.

349
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,947
-You got to just
leave him alone.

350
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,680
-I know that, but
that poor little girl

351
00:14:56,714 --> 00:14:58,114
is suffering because of him.

352
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:10,280
SAKUNO (VOICEOVER): Hmm.

353
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:11,047
OK.

354
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,180
I've got nothing to lose.

355
00:15:12,214 --> 00:15:13,947
I'll act like Tamoka
and be more aggressive.

356
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:17,947
-Uh--

357
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:22,080
-Hey, Ryoma.

358
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:23,614
What kind of music do
you like listening to you

359
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,747
when you're all alone?

360
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,514
I really like--

361
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:26,747
-I don't listen to music.

362
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,280
What's so good about
listening to music?

363
00:15:29,314 --> 00:15:30,280
-Huh?

364
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:32,347
Oh, well, I just
thought-- well, maybe

365
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,247
you might like to listen
to some kind of music

366
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,747
together sometime.

367
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,780
-Echizen!

368
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:37,247
He's making things
even worse for her.

369
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,147
-Hang in there, Ryoma.

370
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,147
-That idiot.

371
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,514
What does he think he's doing?

372
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:44,914
Why doesn't he hurry up and say
something to make her smile?

373
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,747
-Well, it seems like today--

374
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,547
-Huh?

375
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,947
-You sure are talking a lot.

376
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,514
Why is that?

377
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:55,014
-Oh!

378
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,914
[groan]

379
00:15:58,947 --> 00:16:00,647
-Why did you have to say that?

380
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,980
[crying]

381
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:08,314
-I can't stand it anymore.

382
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:09,714
-No, wait, Momoshiro.

383
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:10,214
Don't!

384
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:12,314
-Echizen!

385
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,247
I've been watching you.

386
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,880
I saw everything!

387
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:15,714
-Momo?

388
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:16,814
What are you guys doing here?

389
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:18,314
-What difference does that make?

390
00:16:18,347 --> 00:16:19,980
The question is,
what are you doing?

391
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:20,514
-Huh?

392
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:21,414
What am I--

393
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,347
-Never mind that now.

394
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,114
Just go after her and apologize.

395
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,147
-But why?

396
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,747
I didn't really say
anything to her.

397
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,080
-Just go apologize.

398
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:30,347
Even if the Gods forgive
you for making a girl cry,

399
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,014
I know I'll never be
able to forgive you

400
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:33,580
for reducing her to tears.

401
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:34,114
-Huh?

402
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:36,414
-Now run!

403
00:16:36,447 --> 00:16:37,180
Get going!

404
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:40,080
While you still got time!

405
00:16:40,114 --> 00:16:42,414
MOMO (VOICEOVER) Now that's
what the springtime of youth

406
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:43,314
is all about.

407
00:16:43,347 --> 00:16:44,447
-Hey, kid.

408
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,580
You've got spirit and
passion just like me.

409
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:47,214
I like you.

410
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:49,114
Hahaha.

411
00:16:49,147 --> 00:16:49,947
-Wait a minute.

412
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,314
Tell me who you are, old man.

413
00:16:51,347 --> 00:16:52,814
-Can't you tell
we're two of a kind?

414
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:53,314
-Huh?

415
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:00,814
-Oh.

416
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:14,980
SAKUNO (VOICEOVER) It's stupid.

417
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:17,514
Getting upset like this?

418
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:20,247
I'm always like this.

419
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,014
That's why Ryoma doesn't-- Huh?

420
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:26,980
-Want one?

421
00:17:27,014 --> 00:17:29,447
-Yeah.

422
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,947
Thank you.

423
00:17:36,914 --> 00:17:37,447
-Here.

424
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,580
It's finished.

425
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:39,980
-Thank you very much, sir.

426
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:42,480
-Young lady, in tennis
as well as in life,

427
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:44,314
don't lose your focus.

428
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:49,180
I, Haritatsu, see and hear
everything that goes on.

429
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:50,147
-Yes, sir.

430
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,114
-Please tell Sumire
I said hello.

431
00:17:52,147 --> 00:17:52,647
-Yes.

432
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,414
Yes I will.

433
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,314
Thank you again.

434
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:55,247
-Let's go.

435
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,314
-Oh, Ryoma.

436
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:58,347
Got a minute?

437
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,214
Just playing a
beautiful game of tennis

438
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,614
all the time must be
getting boring for you.

439
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:05,614
It's time you gave up
playing kid's games.

440
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:06,114
-Oh.

441
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:10,547
-But I am a kid.

442
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:14,414
-Just like his father.

443
00:18:18,214 --> 00:18:21,414
-Now it's your turn to
come with me on my errand.

444
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:22,080
-Errand?

445
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:23,280
What could that be?

446
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:26,980
-There now.

447
00:18:27,014 --> 00:18:28,180
That's more like it.

448
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:29,747
-So now it's building
up to the end.

449
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,247
The kiss.

450
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:39,514
SAKUNO (VOICEOVER)
What should I do?

451
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:42,147
I'm playing tennis
against Ryoma.

452
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,147
-Don't get flustered.

453
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,680
This isn't a match.

454
00:18:44,714 --> 00:18:48,247
I'm just checking your form.

455
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,880
SAKUNO (VOICEOVER): So that's
why he brought his racquet.

456
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:52,180
He wants to check out my form.

457
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,214
Ryoma.

458
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:59,214
An upperclassmen was praising
my form just the other day.

459
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:00,347
Don't you remember?

460
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,380
You cautioned me about
it, and now I'm better.

461
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:06,347
-Glad to hear it.

462
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,314
-Ah!

463
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,680
-Oh!

464
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:13,014
That's the form that
won you such praise?

465
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:13,580
-No.

466
00:19:13,614 --> 00:19:14,280
Of course not.

467
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:16,247
I just slipped and fell.

468
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,847
Could you please
feed me another ball?

469
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,414
Ha.

470
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,247
Ryoma?

471
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,247
Thank you for taking
me to Haritatsu's shop

472
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,514
in Grandma's place.

473
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:27,580
-Hmm.

474
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:28,947
-Did she just say
"in Grandma's place"?

475
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,080
-What?

476
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:31,847
So it seems like this
wasn't a date after all.

477
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,614
-I should have known
it couldn't happen.

478
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:34,847
Too weird.

479
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,847
Echizen having a date?

480
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,980
Haha, that's ridiculous.

481
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:37,680
-What?

482
00:19:37,714 --> 00:19:38,814
It's not a date?

483
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:39,614
How boring?

484
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,214
-Oh, what a waste of time.

485
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,780
I'm out of here.

486
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:43,347
Oh!

487
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,147
[groaning]

488
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,980
-Hey, Mister, what's wrong?

489
00:19:46,014 --> 00:19:47,580
Are you all right?

490
00:19:47,614 --> 00:19:52,047
-I'm so hungry I
can't even move.

491
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,014
-You're such a loser.

492
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:54,447
Come on, I'll buy you some food.

493
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,114
-Oh, yeah?

494
00:19:55,147 --> 00:19:56,314
That'd be great, kid.

495
00:19:56,347 --> 00:19:56,880
Thanks.

496
00:19:56,914 --> 00:19:57,614
-What a weirdo.

497
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:59,014
What is this guy's problem?

498
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:04,947
-Well, well.

499
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,047
Look who's here.

500
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,580
And what are you doing
here on a Sunday?

501
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:11,014
-Coach Riuzaki.

502
00:20:11,047 --> 00:20:12,114
-What is it, Tazuka?

503
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,347
-I want you to let me
play against Echizen.

504
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:27,076
[theme music]

505
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,930
-I'm Tazuka, the team captain.

506
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:00,230
Echizen, the most
important thing for you

507
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:03,030
now is to awaken
your true potential.

508
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:06,196
Right now, you're
just copy of your dad.

509
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,163
You've got to want
something badly,

510
00:21:08,196 --> 00:21:10,463
otherwise you'll
never achieve it.

511
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:13,963
Let me see the kind of tennis
that only you can play.

512
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:16,530
Show me that you can take me on.

513
00:21:16,563 --> 00:21:17,530
Next week.

514
00:21:17,563 --> 00:21:19,030
Seigaku's Strongest Man.

515
00:21:19,063 --> 00:21:20,463
Part 1.

516
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:21,596
Echizen.

517
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,096
You think you can beat me?
