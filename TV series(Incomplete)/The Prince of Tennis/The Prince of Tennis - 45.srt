1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,157
JIN (VOICEOVER): I hate this.

2
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,657
It's stupid just
running after balls.

3
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:26,857
Tennis is lame.

4
00:00:37,057 --> 00:00:42,490
-Drive A.

5
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:43,490
-Huh?

6
00:00:43,524 --> 00:00:43,990
-Yes!

7
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:49,057
RYOMA: Oops.

8
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,824
I'm so sorry.

9
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:56,957
It's not good to take
tennis so lightly.

10
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:11,924
[theme music]

11
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:27,259
RYOMA: It's not good to
take tennis so lightly.

12
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:29,459
Well then, I guess
that should teach you

13
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:30,759
not to mess with Kachiro.

14
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,592
-Ryoma!

15
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,092
-Ha!

16
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:42,892
-Come on.

17
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:44,592
What you sitting there for?

18
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:56,325
Because I still owe you
one for Taka, don't I?

19
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:03,259
And while we're at
it, might as well

20
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:06,592
take care of Arai's
payback, too.

21
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,625
-While we're at it?

22
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:23,992
-You are brave.

23
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:28,592
But you won't get away
from me now, brat.

24
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,992
-Same goes for you.

25
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:57,859
-I've never seen
anything like this.

26
00:03:57,892 --> 00:03:59,859
Akutsu's taking a
defensive stance.

27
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,759
-Akutsu's serious now.

28
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:20,492
-Ryoma switched his racket
over to his right hand.

29
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:21,992
-That means--

30
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:22,692
-A kick serve!

31
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:44,125
-That's unreal.

32
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,659
How'd he return like that?

33
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:50,092
-That kick serve is
not an easy one to hit.

34
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:03,992
-He just appeared at the net.

35
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:04,992
-He's fast.

36
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:15,392
In that position, he
can't hit cross court,

37
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:18,392
so he'll probably
go down the line.

38
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:42,359
-H hit cross court from there?

39
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:44,925
That kid must have
some reflexes.

40
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,825
-Boy, he moves incredibly
well-- for a punk.

41
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:50,092
-I'll say.

42
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,759
Looks like this match
could get rough.

43
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:54,092
-There's a surprise.

44
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:58,959
Even though his shots seem
irregular, he keeps attacking.

45
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,159
That's a strange strategy.

46
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:08,592
-Just don't think that I'm
gonna let you steal any more

47
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,325
points off of me, kid.

48
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:15,792
SAKUNO (VOICEOVER): This
guy just isn't normal.

49
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:19,725
I'm scared.

50
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,925
-Wow.

51
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,425
How does he manage
to hit like that?

52
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,592
-Look at that.

53
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,959
He returns those shots with
so much power and speed.

54
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:45,425
-Do you think he's really human?

55
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,192
-I'm not sure.

56
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:49,325
-He has no weak spot.

57
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:50,292
That's not good.

58
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,892
I guess there's always
somebody better, hm?

59
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:59,159
-His game is just different
from yours, Tezuka.

60
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:02,559
-I hope that's a
complement, Fuji.

61
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:04,725
BOY (VOICEOVER): That's
Akutsu's strength, Echizen.

62
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,859
-Is there something
wrong, Miss Shiba?

63
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:18,259
They're just moving too fast
to follow with this camera.

64
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,559
Maybe I should switch to video.

65
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:32,925
-That's it.

66
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,125
The punk kid has
finally found his prey.

67
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,559
-His prey?

68
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:39,292
What?

69
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:40,092
Wait a sec.

70
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,559
Are you talking about Ryoma?

71
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:44,259
-Is that the best
you can do, brat?

72
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:55,725
-Still, I wonder who will
end up being whose prey?

73
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,859
-This should be good.

74
00:08:57,892 --> 00:08:58,825
-That's the way.

75
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:01,125
Go, Akutsu!

76
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,325
-Come on.

77
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:04,892
How can you root for that
creepy guy like that?

78
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:06,359
-He's not creepy!

79
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:08,125
Akutsu is great!

80
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,325
Someday soon, I'll
be just like him.

81
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:16,892
-Hm.

82
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:19,425
-Allow me to express my
gratitude, Coach Ryuzaki.

83
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:28,992
Akutsu-- Do you really
enjoy playing tennis?

84
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:34,025
JIN (VOICEOVER): I hate this.

85
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:40,259
It's stupid just
running after balls.

86
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,759
Tennis is lame.

87
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,559
-So.

88
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:47,792
What do you want to see me for?

89
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:50,159
I don't mind your age
if you want to fight.

90
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:51,359
-Hey, Akutsu.

91
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,692
We're asking you to quit
the tennis club, all right?

92
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,176
BOY: What do you
think of that new kid?

93
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,543
BOY: You mean that Akutsu?

94
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:16,010
Yeah, he's a total jerk.

95
00:10:21,343 --> 00:10:22,510
-Hey, Akutsu.

96
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:25,543
Kids like you just mess
up the dignity of tennis.

97
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:26,710
-That's right!

98
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:28,910
-Yeah, what a
total punk you are.

99
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:31,276
You know, it's like, you can't
just go out and play, huh?

100
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,276
-Just shut up.

101
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,976
It's really not your business.

102
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,810
The dignity of tennis?

103
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:40,443
Give me a break.

104
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:42,410
Well, chump.

105
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:44,176
You want dignity, right?

106
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,943
Well, then win it on the court.

107
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:49,876
[shocked whispering]

108
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:54,076
-Hmph.

109
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,776
-Hey, kid.

110
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,143
I'll play you.

111
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:57,276
-Hey, Shiratama.

112
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,976
-Look, he's here.

113
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,076
He's the one.

114
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,610
-Shiratama.

115
00:11:01,643 --> 00:11:04,543
Yeah, this is the kid
who's been causing trouble.

116
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:06,310
-Who is that?

117
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:07,443
-Who's that?

118
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:09,776
Dude, this guy's just
about a tennis legend.

119
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,643
-Yeah, don't you
know Shiratama's had

120
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:13,410
special training
since he was five?

121
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:15,943
And on top of it, he's been
a runner up three times

122
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,176
and finished in
the top four twice.

123
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,543
-I'm game.

124
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:21,443
Wanna play?

125
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:24,143
Your name's Akutsu, right?

126
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:25,410
I'll play.

127
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:28,143
But, if by chance you happen
to lose to me big shot,

128
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:30,310
well then, I want you
to get out of here

129
00:11:30,343 --> 00:11:34,876
and leave our tennis
club alone forever.

130
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,710
That's what everyone
wants, you know.

131
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,543
-Sure.

132
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:45,343
Let's do it.

133
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:52,076
But, if you lose to
me, what do I get?

134
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:57,743
-Man.

135
00:11:57,776 --> 00:11:59,543
This is just crazy.

136
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:02,043
He really thinks it's
going to beat our man.

137
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:03,010
-Heh.

138
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:05,676
Boy, he doesn't know
how wrong he is.

139
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,576
-Uh, let me think.

140
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,910
Well then--

141
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:16,676
AKUTSU: Don't pick a fight--
if you're not ready to lose.

142
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:23,976
Because if you go
down, I'll beat you up.

143
00:12:37,343 --> 00:12:38,943
-Incredible.

144
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:41,376
-Shiratama sure is
taking a major beating

145
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,410
from that little monster.

146
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,376
-You've been playing since
you were five years old

147
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,276
and you still can't
win a whole tournament?

148
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:55,876
You just stink.

149
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,210
Come on.

150
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:15,943
No way!

151
00:13:15,976 --> 00:13:16,643
-Is he OK?

152
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:17,643
-He did that on purpose!

153
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:19,010
-That's gotta hurt.

154
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:23,410
-What?

155
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:26,043
You're just a big
wuss, aren't you?

156
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:28,443
Get up and take it
like a real man.

157
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:32,443
You scared?

158
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:38,343
-Shiratama!

159
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:39,643
-Now, that wasn't fair.

160
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:40,476
-Bad sportsmanship.

161
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,510
JIN (VOICEOVER); I knew it.

162
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:50,143
They're chicken.

163
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:50,943
Tennis is lame.

164
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:02,943
-Akutsu, are you
playing tennis too?

165
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:09,443
I just started.

166
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:10,876
Isn't it fun?

167
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:20,476
ANNOUNCER: Game to
Yamabuki's Akutsu.

168
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,010
One game to Love.

169
00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:22,643
Change courts.

170
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,643
-Oh, Ryoma!

171
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:29,143
-Ryoma!

172
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,443
-He's always on the attack.

173
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:42,410
-The word defense is
not in his vocabulary.

174
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:46,610
Being able to attack from
any position is his strength.

175
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:49,143
He's a very versatile player.

176
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:52,243
Even after starting his swing
he watches his opponent's

177
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:54,610
movements and can change
his shot's direction.

178
00:14:57,576 --> 00:15:01,043
He's really got
extraordinary flexibility.

179
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:02,243
Amazing.

180
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,443
And a spring in his
step that you rarely

181
00:15:04,476 --> 00:15:06,810
see in a power player.

182
00:15:06,843 --> 00:15:10,076
His ability to react
instantly, his ability

183
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,643
to flex, his drive to destroy,
and his powers of judgment

184
00:15:14,676 --> 00:15:18,276
could make him one of
the best in the world.

185
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,643
Except--

186
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:21,043
-Hm?

187
00:15:21,076 --> 00:15:23,910
-He just doesn't
have the passion

188
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:28,343
or the enthusiasm for the game.

189
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:34,410
But now, with the emergence
of your young player,

190
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:38,076
Akutsu is now determined
to perfect himself.

191
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:45,043
That's why I sincerely
want to thank you

192
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:47,010
for that, Coach Ryuzaki.

193
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:58,176
BOY: No way!

194
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,310
You can't be as tall as I am.

195
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:02,110
151 centimeters?

196
00:16:10,543 --> 00:16:13,043
-I never knew tennis was
all about how tall you are.

197
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,876
TAICHI (VOICEOVER): Ryoma
sure is an awesome player.

198
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,843
Hm.

199
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:25,910
But against Akutsu--

200
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:36,643
BOY: Hey, take it easy, Taichi.

201
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:37,943
See you.

202
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:38,743
I feel loose.

203
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:40,043
I mean, a little sore, too.

204
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:46,476
-Hey, what's going on?

205
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,776
Can you tell me who that
player is out there?

206
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,776
-Who?

207
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,543
Oh, Akutsu.

208
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:55,776
Yeah, old man Banji
brought him over.

209
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,043
Apparently, he's got
some amazing talent,

210
00:16:58,076 --> 00:16:59,943
so the coach likes to
work with him whenever

211
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:01,710
he's got some time to spare.

212
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:04,476
-He hasn't missed
a single shot yet.

213
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,043
And he's-- he's--
he's so gigantic.

214
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:12,010
-Stop it.

215
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:14,076
Hey, make that kid
stop looking at me.

216
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,676
-Now don't worry.

217
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,143
You're hitting well.

218
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:20,176
He's obviously just
impressed by your talent.

219
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:24,243
Now try two balls.

220
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,110
-No way!

221
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:25,610
-Please.

222
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,310
-Come on now.

223
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:35,610
Isn't this fun?

224
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:36,543
-Not really.

225
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:38,010
Tennis is a pretty stupid sport.

226
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,010
-Hey, Akutsu, you dropped this!

227
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:51,243
-Don't need it.

228
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:53,576
-I know, I-- I could
wash it for you.

229
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,843
My name's Taichi, a-a-and I'm
the team manager and I do all

230
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,743
sorts of things for the team,
so it wouldn't be any problem

231
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:00,510
for me to--

232
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:01,343
-Throw it away.

233
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,010
-In that case, can I have it?

234
00:18:08,043 --> 00:18:10,210
-Huh?

235
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:11,610
-You rock.

236
00:18:11,643 --> 00:18:14,110
I've been watching you, and
you're gonna beat them all,

237
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,710
I'm sure.

238
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:23,643
Hmph!

239
00:18:23,676 --> 00:18:25,776
I'm gonna play just like him.

240
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:30,710
-Right.

241
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:31,943
Now I'll be able to
catch everything.

242
00:18:44,943 --> 00:18:49,843
-Akutsu, I know it's
been boring for you.

243
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:52,810
Until now.

244
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:53,543
-Yikes!

245
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:55,310
He's moving to the net.

246
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,610
Of course.

247
00:18:56,643 --> 00:19:00,310
-If he goes to the net, he
might be able to catch up--

248
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,276
TOGETHER: With
Ryoma's Split Step!

249
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:15,376
-You're wasting your time, brat.

250
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:22,110
-Huh?

251
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,176
-No way!

252
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,543
-After our guy jumped, he--

253
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:34,710
-He hit it in the
opposite direction.

254
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:37,543
-Hey, this is getting
pretty interesting.

255
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,476
-Are you out of your mind?

256
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,510
Ryoma's getting ripped
apart out there.

257
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,143
-So, kid.

258
00:19:53,176 --> 00:19:55,610
Is this how you get even?

259
00:20:02,043 --> 00:20:04,943
Don't make me laugh, loser.

260
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:25,002
[theme music]

261
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:55,835
TAKASHI: I'm Takashi Kawamura.

262
00:20:55,869 --> 00:21:00,269
I've known Jin Akutsu since
we were in elementary school.

263
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:03,002
He was good in both
karate and tennis,

264
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:06,202
but he quit because he was
constantly causing trouble.

265
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:09,735
He's playing tennis again,
but nothing's changed.

266
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,802
Am I destined to be
a helpless bystander?

267
00:21:13,835 --> 00:21:17,702
Next on "The Prince of
Tennis," Samurai Spirit.

268
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,935
Ryoma, don't
provoke him anymore.

269
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:22,702
He's dangerous.
