1
00:00:07,237 --> 00:00:09,904
-The Wave Surge?

2
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:12,117
-Graah!

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,104
Ai!

4
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:21,604
Gah!

5
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,037
-Ah-huh!

6
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,504
[theme music]

7
00:01:44,902 --> 00:01:45,369
-Unh!

8
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:49,169
(THINKING) Come on.

9
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:50,735
We're going to win this.

10
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:53,469
Unh!

11
00:01:53,502 --> 00:01:57,035
-(THINKING) Their
willpower is intimidating.

12
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:58,635
This match will
determine the outcome

13
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:00,102
of the entire tournament.

14
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:08,469
This ends now!

15
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:08,969
Unh!

16
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:14,402
-Huh?

17
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:19,335
-Oh!

18
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:24,302
-Ah!

19
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:26,102
-It didn't even bounce.

20
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:27,502
-What was that?

21
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:29,435
It just skidded along the ground
until it went right past them.

22
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:31,702
-That's one of the
best counter-shots

23
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,235
in Fuji's arsenal.

24
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:34,502
The Triple Counter.

25
00:02:34,535 --> 00:02:36,402
-(ALL) The Triple Counter.

26
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:38,302
TACHIBANA: He
might be a problem,

27
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:39,702
this genius, Shusuke Fuji.

28
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:46,402
-Harh!

29
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:48,802
Unh!

30
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,802
Unh-ah!

31
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:51,935
-Looks like Seigaku's
back on track.

32
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:54,669
-Well, they're finally
playing their own game.

33
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:03,402
--[sighs] Wow, this
is getting good!

34
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:05,802
-I'm not letting you
get back into this.

35
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:08,469
Unrh, huh?

36
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:09,669
Can he read them all?

37
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,002
-Unrh!

38
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:16,935
-Oh!

39
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:17,669
[both gasp]

40
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:18,335
-That's it.

41
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:19,369
His Triple Counter!

42
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:20,235
-Awesome.

43
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:20,802
-Yeah!

44
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:22,369
Way to go, Fuji.

45
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,469
-Wow!

46
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:25,802
I guess he really is a genius.

47
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:28,235
Cool!

48
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:29,769
-Well, that was a tough one.

49
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:32,002
The Triple Counter.

50
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:33,302
Got to hand it to him.

51
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:38,269
-Yeah!

52
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,635
[both grunt]

53
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:40,135
-Atta boy!

54
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:41,135
-Aw!

55
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:42,335
-We've got 'em on
the run now, huh?

56
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:43,969
-(THINKING) Got 'em
on the run, do they?

57
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:45,902
Somehow, I think
this Fudomine team

58
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:47,102
isn't going down so easily.

59
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:55,035
-Pick up those balls.

60
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:55,702
Go on.

61
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,435
Quit being so lazy.

62
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:58,435
Hu-unh!

63
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:03,069
[crowd gasps]

64
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:04,235
MALE: That's not the spirit.

65
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,635
Get running, 20 times the field.

66
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:07,902
Move it!

67
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:10,469
-Play a match against
me if you're not afraid.

68
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:11,769
MALE: What'd you say?

69
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:13,269
Watch yourself, Tachibana.

70
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:15,269
-You've got nerve
talking like that.

71
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:17,635
-And if I win, you get to run
20 times around the field,

72
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:20,402
or at least until you drop.

73
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:20,902
-Ho.

74
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:22,302
-What?

75
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:23,769
-That's stupid.

76
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:24,935
Who'd want to do that?

77
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:25,502
Forget it.

78
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:26,335
I'm out of here.

79
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:32,502
-Anyone think they're
stronger than me?

80
00:04:32,535 --> 00:04:33,435
Step up.

81
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:34,102
-(TOGETHER) Huh?

82
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:40,069
-Hey, Tachibana.

83
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:42,102
Last time, we cut
you a lot of slack,

84
00:04:42,135 --> 00:04:45,335
but it seems like you just
don't want to learn, do you?

85
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,169
[all moaning in pain]

86
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:54,602
-So this is the new team, huh?

87
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:56,602
Well, from now
until next spring,

88
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:58,935
you're going to spend your
time picking up tennis balls,

89
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:00,302
and be happy about it.

90
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:10,069
--[sighs] You're a
failure as an adviser.

91
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:10,602
-Unh.

92
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:11,569
What the-- urgh.

93
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,435
-Unh!

94
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,935
-Ooh!

95
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:13,502
-Unh.

96
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:14,835
-[muffled moans]

97
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:16,335
-(TOGETHER) Oh!

98
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:17,802
Huh?

99
00:05:17,835 --> 00:05:18,302
-Aww!

100
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:28,269
[cats meowing]

101
00:05:31,202 --> 00:05:34,002
[loud purring]

102
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:35,569
-(ALL CHANTING) Nationals.

103
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,235
Nationals.

104
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:37,735
Nationals!

105
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:44,469
-(THINKING) Fudomine
Junior High.

106
00:05:44,502 --> 00:05:46,902
These players are a tight team.

107
00:05:46,935 --> 00:05:49,869
Appears their captain, Tachibana
certainly sees to that.

108
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:52,735
-Unh!

109
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,869
-Oh, yeah.

110
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:55,169
-Oh!

111
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:57,869
The Seigaku boys have really
come along, haven't they?

112
00:05:57,902 --> 00:05:59,502
-Let's break those guys now!

113
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:00,469
This is our chance!

114
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:01,502
We do it here!

115
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:02,469
Ruah!

116
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:03,935
-Mm-hm.

117
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:06,702
(THINKING) Now this
next point is key.

118
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:09,635
If we can take this
game, it'll be our serve.

119
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,935
And then we will definitely
have a huge advantage.

120
00:06:17,102 --> 00:06:19,235
-Sakurai, open up
the front court.

121
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:19,735
-Huh?

122
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:26,102
-(TOGETHER) Huh?

123
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,169
-(THINKING) Captain, I'm
going to use that shot.

124
00:06:37,235 --> 00:06:38,902
-Ishida, so tell me.

125
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:40,569
Is your arm starting
to hurt again?

126
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:41,369
-Captain Tachibana.

127
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:50,269
-Nobody can return that
powerful shot of yours,

128
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:52,535
but it's too big a
strain on your arm.

129
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:55,302
You know that
better than anyone.

130
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:58,335
You know you won't be able
to play, so don't use it,

131
00:06:58,369 --> 00:06:59,202
all right?

132
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:01,302
-[laughs] All right then.

133
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:02,269
You're the captain.

134
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:04,135
If you say so, then
I guess I won't.

135
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:09,135
-(THINKING) He going to do it.

136
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:11,002
-Ya-Yah!

137
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:13,569
-(THINKING) This next point
is crucial, all right.

138
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:14,569
-Hm.

139
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:18,135
Captain Tachibana,
Ishida's winning.

140
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:20,002
-Hah!

141
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:20,935
-Unh!

142
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:21,869
-Unh!

143
00:07:21,902 --> 00:07:23,235
-Unh!

144
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:26,035
-Captain Tachibana.

145
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,002
-I guess he can't be stopped.

146
00:07:29,035 --> 00:07:30,469
All right.

147
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:34,402
(THINKING) But just this once.

148
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:35,702
-Now you're talking!

149
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:36,669
Argh!

150
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:37,935
-Ahh!

151
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:38,435
Unh!

152
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:43,369
-(THINKING) Ishida,
don't waste this shot.

153
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:49,035
Bring the momentum
back to Fudomine.

154
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,802
-Argh!

155
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:56,769
-Go for it!

156
00:07:56,802 --> 00:07:57,802
-The Wave Surge!

157
00:07:57,835 --> 00:07:58,735
-[sighs]

158
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,302
-(ALL) What?

159
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:01,469
-The Wave Surge?

160
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:01,969
-Urah!

161
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:14,169
Ai!

162
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:14,669
Yah!

163
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:21,502
-(THINKING) Uh-uh.

164
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,135
I cannot let them take this one.

165
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,569
-(THINKING) Are you really
going to try and hit that back?

166
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:27,635
It's useless.

167
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:29,535
You can't return my
invincible flat shot

168
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:30,869
with those skinny arms of yours.

169
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:32,835
-Let it go, Fuji!

170
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:34,835
-You're not nearly
strong enough.

171
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:41,769
-[inhales] Mine!

172
00:08:41,802 --> 00:08:42,269
Taka!

173
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:48,169
-Unh!

174
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:54,102
Urrgh, oof, oh,
unh, unh, oh, yeah!

175
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:56,569
Got it!

176
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,535
Unh!

177
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:00,535
-God, unbelievable!

178
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:01,102
-Believe it.

179
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:02,002
He returned it.

180
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:03,335
-Grr!

181
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:04,002
-Ishida!

182
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:04,502
-Unh.

183
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:11,202
Arghm!

184
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:12,669
-Look at his stance!

185
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:13,635
-Oh, not again!

186
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:14,269
-Can't be.

187
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:16,202
Not two in a row!

188
00:09:16,235 --> 00:09:17,235
-Don't do it, Ishida.

189
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:18,702
You're going to
hurt your arm again!

190
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:27,902
So tell me, is you're
starting to hurt again.

191
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,502
-Captain Tachibana.

192
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,435
[growling]

193
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:36,102
-Nobody can return that
powerful flat shot of yours.

194
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:38,369
But it's too big a
strain on your arm.

195
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:40,935
You know that
better than anyone.

196
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:43,102
-[laughs] All right then.

197
00:09:43,135 --> 00:09:45,535
You're the captain.

198
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:46,802
And I don't care!

199
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:47,302
Unh-dah!

200
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:53,135
Hawh!

201
00:10:06,735 --> 00:10:09,569
[crowd expresses disbelief]

202
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:14,002
-Uh, hm?

203
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:24,169
-He overdid it.

204
00:10:24,202 --> 00:10:25,702
I'll scold him later.

205
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:28,502
-Yeah, but did you see how
badly his strings broke?

206
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:30,235
-As a matter of fact, I did.

207
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:32,435
But something else
for broke too.

208
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:38,902
-This is fantastic.

209
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:39,769
I can't believe it.

210
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:41,369
Seigaku's winning the game.

211
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:42,935
-Yeah.

212
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:43,569
But still--

213
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,369
-What?

214
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:45,235
Huh?

215
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,002
-All right.

216
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:46,802
-Yeah!

217
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:47,869
-Go, Takashi!

218
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:49,735
One more game!

219
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:52,335
Finish them off with
your Burning Serve.

220
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:54,069
-Leave it to me, little monkey.

221
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:55,135
Hm?

222
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:57,535
What's the matter, Fuji-ko?

223
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:58,335
Ahh!

224
00:10:58,369 --> 00:10:58,835
-(ALL) Huh?

225
00:10:58,869 --> 00:10:59,335
-Hm.

226
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:03,102
-(ALL) Huh?

227
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:03,702
-What happened?

228
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:13,402
-Taka, my friend.

229
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:15,035
You covered for me.

230
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:29,344
-Unh, uhm-mm-mm.

231
00:11:29,377 --> 00:11:30,044
-What?

232
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:31,044
-What?

233
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:32,977
What's going on here?

234
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:33,944
-Sir?

235
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:34,611
-Yes?

236
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:37,011
-We have to default.

237
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:37,577
-What?

238
00:11:37,611 --> 00:11:38,511
-What in the--?

239
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:39,477
-Huh?

240
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:40,377
-It can't be.

241
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:42,677
-Go and get some cooling spray?

242
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:43,444
-(ALL) Huh?

243
00:11:43,477 --> 00:11:44,611
Yes, sir!

244
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:45,744
-What are you saying man!

245
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:47,077
I can still play.

246
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:49,411
You know how important
this first match is.

247
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:50,777
Quitters never win!

248
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:51,744
Unh!

249
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:52,444
Owh!

250
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:52,977
-Don't worry.

251
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:53,844
It'll be fine.

252
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,044
OK?

253
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:17,111
-Well, yeah.

254
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:19,044
I'm so sorry.

255
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:23,577
Ow-ow, ow-ow!

256
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:24,877
-Suck it up.

257
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,377
There's a chance
it could be broken.

258
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:27,577
-Ok, ow!

259
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:29,211
INUI: You need to
go to the hospital.

260
00:12:29,244 --> 00:12:30,777
-(ALL) Eeh!

261
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:31,277
-Captain?

262
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:38,877
-Hm.

263
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,944
The air is getting colder.

264
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:45,177
Kamio, why don't you go warm up?

265
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:46,977
Shinji, go hit with him.

266
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:50,944
You should be limbering
up for your match as well.

267
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:52,977
-So what's up next?

268
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,611
Next up is the
Number One Doubles.

269
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:56,877
It looks like Oishi
and Kikumaru are

270
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:59,477
playing against
Uchimura and Mori.

271
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:01,311
-Then in that case.

272
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:02,611
-It can't be.

273
00:13:02,644 --> 00:13:03,444
Come on.

274
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:05,377
Seigaku can't lose in a default.

275
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:06,044
It's wrong.

276
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,044
Just wrong!

277
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:07,977
-Huh?

278
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:11,811
Well, What's going
to happen now?

279
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:12,311
-Hm?

280
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:15,744
-Hm.

281
00:13:21,144 --> 00:13:24,744
(THINKING) Our usually laid-back
friend has gotten serious.

282
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:29,111
Better watch out, hmph!

283
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:31,211
MATCH ANNOUNCER: This
is a one-set match.

284
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:34,811
Seigaku's Oishi to serve.

285
00:13:34,844 --> 00:13:38,211
-(THINKING) We'll
flatten them in no time.

286
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:39,244
-(THINKING) OK.

287
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,944
We'll show 'em what
we're capable of.

288
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:43,344
-Huh, unh!

289
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:44,511
-(THINKING) I'll teach them.

290
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:45,611
-Unh.

291
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:50,811
Here, why, they call me
the Forward Net Killer.

292
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:51,777
-Eyah!

293
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:52,744
-(ALL) No!

294
00:13:52,777 --> 00:13:55,177
-He's aiming straight
at Eiji's face.

295
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:56,644
Be careful!

296
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:57,611
-(BOTH) Oh!

297
00:13:57,644 --> 00:13:58,111
-Unh!

298
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:06,377
That was totally easy.

299
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:06,911
-Oh!

300
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:07,544
-We did it!

301
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:08,944
We won the points!

302
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:10,044

FEMALE: He's so awesome.

306
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:12,744
UCHIMURA: What?

307
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:13,511
How could he?

308
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:14,377
How does he move like it?

309
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:20,244
-Just like that.

310
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,377
Got it?

311
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:22,177
-That rocks.

312
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:22,677
Yeah!

313
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:23,244
-Come on.

314
00:14:23,277 --> 00:14:24,111
Piece of cake.

315
00:14:24,144 --> 00:14:27,477

Ryoma?

321
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,811
Where are you off to?

322
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:40,644
-I'm thirsty.

323
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:42,311
I'm getting a drink of water.

324
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:44,111
-Well, don't be
gone for too long.

325
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:45,211
Matches are on.

326

-Oh.

330
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:53,844
Huh?

331
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:55,477
It's that kid.

332
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:58,411
[sighs]

333
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:00,944
DOCTOR : You hurt yourself
by hitting a ball?

334
00:15:00,977 --> 00:15:01,877
Mm.

335
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:03,744
The ball broke his
tennis strings?

336
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,244
It doesn't seem possible.

337
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:06,811
[laughs]

338
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:07,511
-Umph.

339
00:15:07,544 --> 00:15:08,744
But it's true.

340
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:10,311
Really.

341
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,211

Look at this!

346
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:29,144
This is some show.

347
00:15:29,177 --> 00:15:31,277
They're hitting two balls
at such a short distance.

353
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:53,077
You should probably get
some balls and warm up.

354
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:55,877
After all, your
match is up next.

355

-Mm. [sigh]

356
00:15:58,077 --> 00:16:00,477
-And if you see
Echizen, bring him back.

357
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,411
-What?

358
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:02,711
No way!

359
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:05,511
-The little guy could
have gotten lost.

360
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:08,077
Upperclassmen need to help.

361
00:16:08,111 --> 00:16:10,711
It's your job, right?

362
00:16:10,744 --> 00:16:11,677
-Eegh.

363
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:15,044
Unh, aww.

364
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:17,944
-[laughs]

365
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,511
MALE: These two are Kamio
and Ibu of Fudomine.

-Hm?

367
00:16:21,177 --> 00:16:21,744
(THINKING) Kamio?

368
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:28,977
That idiot!

369
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:29,477
-Oh!

370
00:16:32,377 --> 00:16:33,311
-(THINKING) He-he-he.

371
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:35,144
Now we have a full cast.

372
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:37,177
-We managed to beat
Fuji in doubles,

373
00:16:37,211 --> 00:16:39,644
but it really comes
down us in singles.

374
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:44,277
-Where is your confidence, huh?

375
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:45,344
-It's still here.

376
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:46,611
Don't you worry.

377
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:48,877
I'm bursting with confidence.

378
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:51,111
Even more than our captain.

379
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:51,611
-Huh.

380
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,111
-Hmm.

381
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:55,544
-[growling] Huh?

382
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:02,044
-Uh.

383
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:05,011
[grunting]

384
00:17:05,044 --> 00:17:06,511
-What?

385
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:07,011
-Huh?

386
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:14,344
Hah.

387
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:14,844
-Oh?

388
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,111
-Huh?

389
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:26,611
-Uh?

390
00:17:26,644 --> 00:17:27,577
-No way!

391
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:28,577
He went through that!

392
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:29,277
-Wow!

393
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:30,277
How did me manage that?

394
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:31,777
-He's a regular for Seigaku.

395
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:33,111
And only a seventh grader.

396
00:17:33,144 --> 00:17:35,544
-(WITH DISDAIN) Oh.

397
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:36,377
-For real?

398
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:43,044
-You still have a ways to go.

399
00:17:43,077 --> 00:17:44,911
Hey!

400
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:47,144
How'd you feel about
adding another ball?

401
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:50,344
-That punk!

402
00:17:50,377 --> 00:17:54,011
Better stop mouthing
off kid, or else!

403
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:55,777
-Hey!

404
00:17:55,811 --> 00:17:58,277
You got a problem with
our seventh grader?

405
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,244
-Hm?

406
00:18:00,277 --> 00:18:01,211
-Oh-huh.

407
00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:02,211
Uh-oh.

408
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:03,777
Enough's enough here.

409
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:04,277
-Huh?

410
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:05,477
It's An!

411
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:07,577
-Hey, aren't you guys supposed
to be out on the courts.

412
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:10,111
If you're doing anything
other than warming up,

413
00:18:10,144 --> 00:18:12,011
I'll tell your captain.

414
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:13,911
-Yeah, OK.

415
00:18:13,944 --> 00:18:16,811
Well, I can't wait for
our match, Mr. Seigaku.

416
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:17,311
Yeah.

417
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:31,311
-You guys may look cool, but
you're still pretty hot-headed.

418
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,911
But I still don't get
tired of watching you.

419
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:34,811
-Who's this?

420
00:18:34,844 --> 00:18:36,211
-Don't know.

421
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:37,711
-Don't worry about me.

422
00:18:37,744 --> 00:18:39,877
Worry about the match
you're about to play.

423
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,644
Kamio's the type of
player who's going

424
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:44,044
to give you a really hard time.

425
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:45,577
-Really?

426
00:18:45,611 --> 00:18:46,877
Hmm?

427
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,511
AN: And Shinji Ibu, he's
got the same feel for tennis

428
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:52,744
as your genius, Shusuke Fuji.

429
00:18:52,777 --> 00:18:55,411
-How do you know so much?

430
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:59,711
AN: [giggles] That's a secret.

431
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:04,544
Oh! [gasps] I can't
stand this rain!

432
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:05,944
See you later!

433
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:11,211
-Don't just stand there!

434
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:12,777
Get out of here!

435
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:14,044
-OK.

436
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:15,377
-Got it!

437
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:16,811
MALE: Not the rain!

438
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:18,544
No-ho, this is bad!

439
00:19:18,577 --> 00:19:19,244
-No!

440
00:19:19,277 --> 00:19:20,577
I'm getting soaked!

441
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:21,277
-Wait!

442
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:23,077
My umbrella should help.

443
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:25,711
-This rain may blow
over soon, but the game

444
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:28,477
could be affected by it.

445
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:29,477
-Uh!

446
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:30,444
-(THINKING) He slipped.

447
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:31,711
Now's my chance!

448
00:19:31,744 --> 00:19:33,611
How do like this!

449
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:36,044
-Unh, unh!

450
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:40,411
-No way!

451
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:41,044
Not again.

452
00:19:58,311 --> 00:19:58,777
-Hm.

453
00:20:01,811 --> 00:20:02,911
Hmm.

454
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:04,777
AN (VOICEOVER): He's got
the same feel for tennis

455
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:06,744
as you genius, Shusuke Fuji.

456
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,999
[theme music]

457
00:20:57,435 --> 00:20:58,801
OISHI (VOICEOVER): Hello.

458
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:01,901
I'm Shuichiro Oishi, assistant
captain of the Seigaku Tennis

459
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:02,735
Team.

460
00:21:02,768 --> 00:21:04,935
That Fudomine team is amazing.

461
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:08,135
The Seigaku regulars were all
stunned by Ishida's Wave Surge

462
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:09,135
Shot.

463
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,568
Our Number Two Doubles
team was forced

464
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:13,235
to concede when Taka himself.

465
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:16,335
But Eiji and I will even things
out in our Number One Doubles

466
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:17,601
match.

467
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:20,268
In the next "Prince of
Tennis", "The Boomerang Snake".

468
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:24,468
But hey, Kaido, what in
the world is that move?
