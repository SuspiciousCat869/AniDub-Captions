1
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:12,276
-It's bad.

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,910
He's still bleeding.

3
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:18,810
His eye seems OK, but the
eye lid is split open.

4
00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:19,543
-Wow, Ryoma.

5
00:00:19,576 --> 00:00:20,410
That must hurt a lot, huh?

6
00:00:23,043 --> 00:00:25,910
Hey, Taka, you don't need to go
to the hospital again, do you?

7
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,210
-You know, he shouldn't have
forced his shot like that.

8
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:28,910
-Heh.

9
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:30,076
Serves him right anyway.

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,043
-How is he, Oishi.

11
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:37,010
-It's not good.

12
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:38,776
There's no way
he's playing today.

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,076
I hate to forfeit the game,
but it's not happening.

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,710
-You think it's over?

15
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:47,076
-Shinji won't be at all
happy with this kind of win.

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,910
-That's for sure.

17
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:49,976
-Unbelievable.

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,676
Look at what happened
to your racket.

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,676
Echizen, I'm gonna
throw this in your bag.

20
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:01,010
-Hold it, Momo.

21
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:02,143
-Huh?

22
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:04,176
-While you're at it,
go ahead and get out

23
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,076
a new racket for me.

24
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,043
-Ryoma!

25
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:08,510
Oh, no!

26
00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:11,376
[theme music]

27
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:23,320
-Whoa.

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,953
-You sure this is just
a district qualifier?

29
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:33,320
-Man, these guys
are really good.

30
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,486
-You know, the
two of them really

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
need to slow down their
pace a little bit.

32
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:39,353
-I don't think those
guys are the types that

33
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:40,786
worry about pacing so much.

34
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,120
-You're correct.

35
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:44,986
But still, I'm gathering some
good data here for later.

36
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,453
-It's cross court!

37
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:01,220
He can't get it!

38
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:21,986
ANNOUNCER: 15-All.

39
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,920
BOY: He forehanded
with his right.

40
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,353
No way!

41
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:27,720
-It's the two sword style.

42
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:32,220
-What's that?

43
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,620
Two sword style maybe?

44
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:35,853
BOY: Come on, let's go.

45
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:36,820
Hey, hurry up!

46
00:04:05,153 --> 00:04:06,586
KATSUO: Ryoma's
going to the net!

47
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,453
-I've never seen Echizen rush
the net that aggressively.

48
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:12,686
-What the-- Who
does he think he is?

49
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,153
Now, that's a perfect lob.

50
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:16,653
-He'll never get it.

51
00:04:16,686 --> 00:04:18,120
You can do it, Ryoma!

52
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:29,553
ANNOUNCER: 40-15.

53
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:31,353
-Wow, unbelievable!

54
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:33,853
-My gosh, he's totally amazing.

55
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:37,920
TOMOKA (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe

56
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:39,953
that Shinji is
getting pushed around.

57
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:43,486
And that kid hits with
his left hand now.

58
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,753
SAKUNO (VOICEOVER): When Ryoma
plays tennis, he is so cool.

59
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:57,453
-Shinji.

60
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:59,520
When are you gonna get serious?

61
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:01,586
I know you let your
opponents feel confident

62
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,220
and then come back
from behind to win,

63
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:07,386
but if you don't start now,
this match is over for you.

64
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,120
I wonder, is Shinji
having a hard time?

65
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:27,853
-What an awesome overhead.

66
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:28,686
-Come on, Echizen!

67
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,886
It's time to turn up the heat!

68
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,953
-Game to Echizen.

69
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:34,086
Four games to one.

70
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,886
-That's not good.

71
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,620
-This is a complete blowout.

72
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:39,253
Ryoma's on fire.

73
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:40,086
-Exactly.

74
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,520
So we need to kick it up too.

75
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:03,553
-Who is that seventh grader?

76
00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:06,253
He's running Shinji ragged.

77
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:07,753
Not good.

78
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:32,220
Oh Shinji.

79
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:32,720
You're not--

80
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:41,353
-There's something very
weird about his attack.

81
00:06:41,386 --> 00:06:42,653
-Huh?

82
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:45,586
-Yeah, he's hitting top spin
shots and slices like one

83
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,386
after the other.

84
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:51,620
-You're right.

85
00:06:57,686 --> 00:06:58,886
-This ball's mine.

86
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:22,086
[gasps]

87
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,853
-15-Love.

88
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:24,720
-What's wrong?

89
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:25,853
That was easy.

90
00:07:25,886 --> 00:07:27,453
Even I could've
returned that ball.

91
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:28,986
-He was just unlucky.

92
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,286
-It's only one point.

93
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,586
Don't worry, you guys.

94
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,820
-That was lousy.

95
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,286
-It looks like the
little guy just

96
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,053
stopped playing for a second.

97
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:37,753
His opponent plays well.

98
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:38,753
Don't forget that.

99
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,153
RYOMA: What's with my arm?

100
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:57,720
-I will stop you.

101
00:07:57,753 --> 00:07:59,220
Take my word.

102
00:07:59,253 --> 00:08:00,486
-What just happened?

103
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,920
-Shinji stunned that
seventh grade player.

104
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:03,986
-Huh?

105
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,720
-It was a bit of
a gamble to try.

106
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:10,086
Top spins and slices.

107
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,986
By alternately unleashing
top spin and back spin,

108
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,020
the muscles contract,
which cause momentary spot

109
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:20,853
paralysis in the opponent's arm.

110
00:08:20,886 --> 00:08:22,253
-How's that?

111
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:25,786
-It's only for a second,
until the feeling comes back,

112
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,020
and Shinji seized the moment.

113
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:30,986
-Where'd Shinji learn that?

114
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,186
ANNOUNCER: 30-Love.

115
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,220
-It's a bit risky, and
it can backfire big time.

116
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:37,453
It shows you how far
he's been pushed.

117
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:44,553
-He's doing it again.

118
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:51,253
-Huh?

119
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,120
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): Oh!

120
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:09,186
My-- my arm again.

121
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,086
-The kid is pivoting.

122
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,020
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): That hurt!

123
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,420
-Don't do that.

124
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,086
He's turning his body
to force that shot.

125
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,020
INUI (VOICEOVER): Echizen.

126
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:17,553
No.

127
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,020
-It's hopeless.

128
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:25,120
When you're hit with
a spot paralysis,

129
00:09:25,153 --> 00:09:28,053
you're gonna lose your grip.

130
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:28,620
-Huh?

131
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,586
-Huh?

132
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,586
-Oh no.

133
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,086
-Hey, watch out.

134
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:41,686
MOMOSHIRO: Taka, you're
going the wrong way.

135
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,953
Come on, let's go.

136
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:46,020
-Oh, yeah!

137
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:46,920
-Momoshiro.

138
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,186
Are you sure about this?

139
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,920
Coach might be upset
if she finds out

140
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:52,020
that you snuck out to get me.

141
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:53,253
-I'm sure she will.

142
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:54,953
But we should all be
there for the win!

143
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:56,953
-You know, you're crazy.

144
00:09:56,986 --> 00:10:02,120
-Seigaku will win
the game, yeah!

145
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:03,053
huh?

146
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:06,453
[excited chatter]

147
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:08,353
MAN: Wow, would you
look at that game?

148
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,486
-Ryoma!

149
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:27,986
-Oh no.

150
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,486
Ryoma.

151
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,980
SHINJI: It's hopeless.

152
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:45,780
When you're hit with
a spot paralysis,

153
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,146
you're gonna lose your grip.

154
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:52,380
-Huh?

155
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:53,380
-Oh no.

156
00:10:53,413 --> 00:10:54,846
-Hey, watch out.

157
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:01,746
[shocked whispering]

158
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:16,180
BOY: It's bleeding

159
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:18,113
-Ryoma!

160
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:19,080
Oh, Ryoma.

161
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:20,980
Are you all right?

162
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,380
-You can't come on to the court.

163
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,880
-Here.

164
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:30,580
-Keep it.

165
00:11:30,613 --> 00:11:32,280
Get off the court now.

166
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:34,846
-But you really need
to get to a hospital.

167
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,546
-No way.

168
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,613
I'm fine.

169
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:38,713
-But you're bleeding
all over the court.

170
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:42,913
-Man.

171
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:43,913
My racket's busted.

172
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:47,613
-Oh.

173
00:11:47,646 --> 00:11:48,980
Oh, forget about that.

174
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:49,980
You're hurt, Ryoma.

175
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,780
-Excuse me, miss,
but only players

176
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:53,580
are allowed on the court.

177
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:54,780
-You mean me?

178
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:57,546
Ryoma. we have to
get you out of here.

179
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,780
-Hey, hold on.

180
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:00,246
-You cannot play like this.

181
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,880
You're injured.

182
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:05,080
Hi grandma.

183
00:12:05,113 --> 00:12:06,346
-You have to go now.

184
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,880
You're embarrassing the player.

185
00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:09,613
My granddaughter
should know that.

186
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,113
What in the world were
you thinking, Sakuno?

187
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:15,346
-But granny, Ryoma is injured.

188
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,846
-Let's stop the bleeding.

189
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,513
Somebody bring the
first aid kit right now.

190
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:24,846
-Wow.

191
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,946
Do you think he's
going to be all right?

192
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,146
-He's bleeding a lot.

193
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,480
It doesn't look good for Ryoma.

194
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,413
-He's not gonna be
able to play like this.

195
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:40,313
-He was playing
well up until now.

196
00:12:40,346 --> 00:12:42,113
-The poor guy's injured.

197
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:44,380
He shouldn't be allowed
to keep playing like that.

198
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:45,346
-This stinks.

199
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,580
He almost had it locked up.

200
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:50,213
You know, Echizen
would really hate it

201
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:52,213
if we had to forfeit
the entire match.

202
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:58,346
-So you're saying he
should just keep playing?

203
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,280
Why is that?

204
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:03,046
You'd be happy if he lost
his eyesight, wouldn't you?

205
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,646
-We're sorry!

206
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:07,646
-Oh my.

207
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,913
I can't believe I
yelled at you guys.

208
00:13:13,646 --> 00:13:15,580
-I think she's gone
completely insane.

209
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:18,480
-She's just not
acting like herself.

210
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:20,080
-Yeah, she's acting like Tomoka.

211
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:27,746
GIRL: Hey, you guys.

212
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,246
-Huh?

213
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,713
What's up?

214
00:13:29,746 --> 00:13:30,246
-That player.

215
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,880
Is he OK?

216
00:13:31,913 --> 00:13:32,680
-Don't know yet.

217
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,713
-It's bad.

218
00:13:37,746 --> 00:13:39,213
He's still bleeding.

219
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:44,080
His eye seems OK, but
the eyelid is split open.

220
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:46,113
-Wow, Ryoma, that
must hurt a lot, huh?

221
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:51,346
-Taka, you don't need to go
to the hospital again, do you?

222
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,846
-You know, he shouldn't have
forced his shot like that.

223
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,546
-Heh.

224
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,413
Serves him right anyway.

225
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:02,946
-How is he, Oishi?

226
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,913
It's not good.

227
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:05,613
There's no way
he's playing today.

228
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:08,680
I hate to forfeit the game,
but it's not happening.

229
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:10,280
-You think it's over?

230
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:14,013
-Shinji won't be an all
happy with this kind of win.

231
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:14,946
-That's for sure.

232
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,513
-Unbelievable.

233
00:14:20,546 --> 00:14:22,213
Look what happened
to your racket.

234
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:24,280
Echizen, I'm gonna throw
this into your bag.

235
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:31,213
-Hold it, Momo.

236
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,846
-Huh?

237
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,813
-While you're at it,
go ahead and get out

238
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:37,080
a new racket for me.

239
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:39,246
-Ryoma, oh no!

240
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,080
-Oh, OK.

241
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,280
-You can't play.

242
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:43,346
You're injured!

243
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,880
-You really shouldn't
play, since you'd

244
00:14:44,913 --> 00:14:47,713
be at a disadvantage.

245
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:48,880
ANNOUNCER: Echizen.

246
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:50,913
Don't tell me you
want to continue.

247
00:14:50,946 --> 00:14:53,380
I can't permit it, especially
if you're bleeding.

248
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:55,646
I know you're disappointed,
but it's over, OK?

249
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:04,413
-Huh?

250
00:15:09,446 --> 00:15:10,146
-I'll play.

251
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,013
-But Echizen, listen to me.

252
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:16,580
-But it stopped bleeding.

253
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:20,346
Ryoma, Come here now.

254
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,346
What do you mean it
stopped bleeding?

255
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,080
You can't keep playing,
you stubborn fool.

256
00:15:26,113 --> 00:15:29,013
-But why not?

257
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:31,780
-But isn't it hurting you?

258
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:32,946
-No, it's not.

259
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,413
-Hm.

260
00:15:37,446 --> 00:15:38,346
Oishi.

261
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,746
Bring the first
aid kit over here.

262
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,280
-Uh.

263
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:41,013
Yes, Coach.

264
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:45,280
COACH RYUZAKI: Ryoma.

265
00:15:45,313 --> 00:15:46,846
This is gonna hurt.

266
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,313
RYOMA: Ah.

267
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:50,313
Coach Ryuzaki.

268
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:08,546
-Well, looks like we're done.

269
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:13,180
-Hey, it-- it stopped.

270
00:16:15,846 --> 00:16:16,880
-He's patched up?

271
00:16:16,913 --> 00:16:19,213
It was bleeding so
hard just a second ago.

272
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:20,046
-All right, kid.

273
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,880
This is a quick fix at best.

274
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:24,480
You've got 15 minutes
tops, you got it?

275
00:16:24,513 --> 00:16:25,880
-Wow, it's Sumire magic.

276
00:16:25,913 --> 00:16:26,546
-Fuji!

277
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,013
Do not call me that.

278
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:33,980
-If there's no blood,
then I can play, right?

279
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:36,346
-Well, I did say that,
but you are clearly

280
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,680
not in any condition to
keep on playing today.

281
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:41,980
-Hey Echizen, your racket.

282
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:43,113
-Thanks a lot, Momo.

283
00:16:43,146 --> 00:16:43,713
I'm ready.

284
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:47,980
-Oishi.

285
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:56,813
-Captain?

286
00:16:56,846 --> 00:16:57,313
-Huh?

287
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,346
-Listen to me.

288
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,880
Finish the match in 10
minutes, or you forfeit.

289
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:06,913
-Tezuka.

290
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:09,480
-You got that?

291
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:10,846
-That's enough time.

292
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,713
-Echizen, go for it.

293
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:17,913
But watch yourself out there.

294
00:17:21,346 --> 00:17:22,413
-I think you'll need that.

295
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,346
-Hey, thanks Kaidoh.

296
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:45,213
[excited chatter]

297
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:46,546
BOY: How can he play like that?

298
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,446
This is unbelievable.

299
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:54,213
-Does he really think he can
play Shinji with that injury?

300
00:17:54,246 --> 00:17:55,080
That's just crazy.

301
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,713
-That's insane.

302
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:04,080
And besides, his
opponent's so tricky.

303
00:18:04,113 --> 00:18:05,780
He's in a really tough spot.

304
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:08,013
-There's no way he
can win like that.

305
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,913
-Even healthy he was in a pinch.

306
00:18:09,946 --> 00:18:11,180
But right now?

307
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:11,980
-He's gonna lose!

308
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,846
FEMALE VOICE: Come on.

309
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,346
You can bring this
championship home.

310

SHINJI (VOICEOVER):
That's right.

311
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:02,213
Bring it on.

312
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:05,213
I haven't destroyed you yet.

313
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:09,180
Huh?

314
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:14,146
What's happening?

315
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,646
He's even quicker.

316
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,080
MAN (VOICEOVER): Wow.

317
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,546

-Hey.

320
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,413
You guys worry too much.

321
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:44,713
It was just a scratch.

322
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:53,113
-Oh Ryoma.

323
00:19:53,146 --> 00:19:54,680
-That's our boy.

324
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:57,213
He wouldn't even let
bloodshed stop him.

I'm Takashi Kawamura!

329
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:02,810
Echizen, you don't need to
worry about that injury.

330
00:21:02,843 --> 00:21:04,476
You can win, baby!

331
