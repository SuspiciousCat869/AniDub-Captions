1
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,076
-Hey, who's that short kid?

2
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,643
-Wh-- what did you say?

3
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:26,476
Uh, I'm not really sure.

4
00:00:32,143 --> 00:00:34,610
He has some serve,
that's for sure.

5
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,010
Hey, Akutsu, sorry, but
it looks like there's

6
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:48,376
trouble on the court.

7
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,643
I know we've been buds,
but can you leave now?

8
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:54,910
-Don't you dare order me around.

9
00:00:54,943 --> 00:00:56,076
-Uh, I'm sorry.

10
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,210
-Looks like that kid
got to it before I did.

11
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:16,376
-Ahhh.

12
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,410
-I wanted to mess
with you guys too.

13
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:32,843
[theme music]

14
00:02:56,985 --> 00:03:00,719
-Wow, it looks like we have
really great fish today.

15
00:03:00,752 --> 00:03:03,252
-You're getting much better
about knowing the ingredients

16
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:05,852
for sushi.

17
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,252
-Well, I have a great teacher.

18
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:10,619
-Oh, really?

19
00:03:10,652 --> 00:03:13,419
No doubt about it,
parents all over the world

20
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:16,219
hope their sons will take
over their father's profession

21
00:03:16,252 --> 00:03:17,985
with great success.

22
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:20,519
-Well, it's still too early
to talk about that, Dad.

23
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:26,319
-Ever since you
were a little boy,

24
00:03:26,352 --> 00:03:29,252
you kept changing your
mind over and over again

25
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:31,385
about what you
wanted to do and what

26
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,519
you wanted to be when
you were all grown up.

27
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:37,385
Why don't you try acting
according to your principles,

28
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:38,785
like I do.

29
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,652
-Well, as a matter of fact, I
have many things I want to do.

30
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:43,985
-Give me a break, will ya?

31
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,052
I know you were
crazy about karate

32
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:47,852
before getting
interested in tennis.

33
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:49,885
Whatever happened to that?

34
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,252
-Tennis is my number
one passion now.

35
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:55,552
-I see you've also been
developing the gift of gab.

36
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,519
-So you and Aria are
going to be ball boys?

37
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:04,185
-Yeah.

38
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:05,919
-You know, Aria
is short tempered,

39
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:07,952
so you'd better be
careful, Kachiro.

40
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:08,919
-He's right.

41
00:04:08,952 --> 00:04:12,285
You better not
make him angry, OK?

42
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,052
-Hey, Kato, hurry up.

43
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:15,552
-OK.

44
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:32,285
-Hey, who are you?

45
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,419
What school are you from?

46
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:38,085
Hey, you better answer me.

47
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,352
-Um, Arai?

48
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:41,052
-If you don't have any business
around here then leave.

49
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:03,052
-Arai, you OK?

50
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:07,285
-Just what do you
think you're doing?

51
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:13,085
-You talking to me?

52
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:16,152
-Listen, don't you try
acting dumb with me.

53
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,485
Now get the heck out of here.

54
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:31,819
[punching sounds]

55
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:40,319
-Arai, are you all right?

56
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:47,085
-You're a member of
the tennis team, right?

57
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:48,485
-Uh-huh.

58
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,152
-There's a seventh grade
regular whose name is something

59
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,652
like Echigoya, isn't that right?

60
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:56,019
KACHIRO (VOICEOVER): A
seventh grader regular?

61
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:57,719
He must mean Ryoma.

62
00:05:57,752 --> 00:05:58,585
-What a minute, you.

63
00:05:58,619 --> 00:05:59,985
I'm not finished with you yet.

64
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:00,952
Not by a long--

65
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:06,785
-Arai!

66
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:07,919
Arai!

67
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:10,185
-Who do you think you're
ordering around here?

68
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,319
-I should go find a teacher
and tell them whats happening.

69
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,252
-Hey you.

70
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:32,085
Bring over Echigoya or else.

71
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,152
Echigoya.

72
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,419
He's not running away, is he?

73
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:57,485
Maybe I'll hit your
face with my next shot.

74
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:18,085
-Ryoma.

75
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:18,585
-Huh?

76
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:20,619
Echizen.

77
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:23,919
-What's going on
around here anyway?

78
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:25,085
-Be careful of that guy.

79
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:27,285
He's a total psycho.

80
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,952
-So I finally get to meet
the seventh grade regular.

81
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:32,685
-I don't think I've
ever met you before.

82
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:40,652
-Look out!

83
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:41,252
He's got a rock!

84
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,419
-I'm so psycho.

85
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:01,252
Man, its great.

86
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:12,819
-Ow.

87
00:08:12,852 --> 00:08:13,852
Ouch.

88
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:16,085
-There, you've been
hurt pretty badly.

89
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:18,552
Someone did this to you,
and I want to know who.

90
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:21,052
And don't tell me you
fell down on your own.

91
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:23,152
-I fell down on my own.

92
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:26,619
-Won't you let me help?

93
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:29,119
-Someone from another
school attacked Echizen?

94
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:31,919
-Yeah, he's being treated in
the nurse's office now for cuts

95
00:08:31,952 --> 00:08:33,119
and bruises.

96
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:36,285
Akutsu is obviously a very
violent type of person.

97
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:39,452
He kicked Arai repeatedly
and served rocks at Echizen.

98
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,819
He's from Yamabuki Junior High.

99
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:43,719
There's a possibility
we'll be playing them

100
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:46,319
in the finals of the
Metropolitan matches.

101
00:08:46,352 --> 00:08:47,852
-It's Sengoku's team.

102
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:50,785
-We better report this to the
Junior High Physical Education

103
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:52,185
Association.

104
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:54,419
We'll need to ask Shusuke and
Miss Ruyzaki for the decision.

105
00:08:58,052 --> 00:08:59,885
-Echizen, are you all right?

106
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,585
-Echizen.

107
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:01,152
What?

108
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:01,785
-It's nothing.

109
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:04,585
I just fell down.

110
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:07,652
-Hey, Echizen, if we file
a complaint against them.

111
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:08,485
-I fell down.

112
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:13,019
-No way, Oishi.

113
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:17,019
The look on his face says he's
going to settle this himself.

114
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:18,019
-Oh no.

115
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:19,285
Just, please, don't
make any trouble.

116
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:30,852
-Are you OK, Ryoma?

117
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:32,819
-Today's performance was
only an introduction.

118
00:09:36,552 --> 00:09:37,019
-You.

119
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:48,785
-Don't rush things.

120
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:51,852
Advance to the finals of
the Metropolitan matches.

121
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:53,719
I'm a ninth grader
from Yamabuki.

122
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:54,719
Name's Akutsu.

123
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:12,615
-Seems like Inui's
training us harder

124
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:15,615
since he went to visit
Ginka Junior High.

125
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,581
-Ginka's training methods
must have motivated him.

126
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:21,715
-If Ginka's that strong,
I don't want to find out.

127
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:28,815
-Hey, you'll only get more
tired if you keep talking.

128
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:29,781
-OK.

129
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:31,081
-Is something wrong
with you Taka?

130
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:31,915
-Not a thing.

131
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:32,948
I'm fine.

132
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:34,315
-Well, tell me if
you don't feel well.

133
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:36,615
You know you shouldn't over
train before the Metropolitan

134
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:38,415
finals, OK?

135
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:38,981
-Yeah.

136
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:40,481
I'm all right.

137
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,281
-Ryoma, are you all right?

138
00:10:42,315 --> 00:10:43,681
-I never felt better.

139
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:54,481
-OK, everyone, time
for a water break now.

140
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:55,315
[cheering]

141
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:00,681
-Thanks a lot, Inui.

142
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:01,281
I was thirsty.

143
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:02,648
-Recharge completed.

144
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:06,048
Ready to push on.

145
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:07,015
-You're welcome.

146
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,148
Here, this one is yours.

147
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:27,048
-What happened?

148
00:11:33,281 --> 00:11:35,181
-Inui, what's going on?

149
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:38,081
-From now on, if your lap
time is more than one minute,

150
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,115
you drink this.

151
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:40,848
-What is it?

152
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:44,848
-I've named it penal tea.

153
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:59,015
This penal tea is very good
for the body and the mind.

154
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:00,615
-Get that horrible
stuff away from me.

155
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:02,581
-What do you think is
in that thick drink?

156
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:03,515
-I don't want to know.

157
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:05,015
-I'm accelerating.

158
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:07,981
I refuse to drink
that putrid slime.

159
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:12,181
-It's working perfectly.

160
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:15,348
-The more laps that go by now,
the more victims we'll have.

161
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:17,048
How about you, coach?

162
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:18,515
Care for a sip?

163
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:19,781
-No, thank you.

164
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:20,715
-I think its tasty.

165
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:29,381
-It doesn't look like
the others agree.

166
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:38,248
-It's spicy and I still have
a bad taste in my mouth.

167
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:40,215
-I don't feel so good.

168
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:42,415
-The regulars are still running.

169
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:45,048
-They must be on
their 30th lap by now.

170
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:46,648
-They're all in
really great shape.

171
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:47,781
-Sure are.

172
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:50,181
-They really are serious
about not drinking that.

173
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:51,048
-It's the last lap.

174
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:52,648
Let me take out a special one.

175
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:57,581
Last one to finish
gets to drink this.

176
00:12:57,615 --> 00:12:59,948
ALL: Drink the whole thing?

177
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:04,115
-In that case, I can't lose.

178
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:07,215
What do you think you're doing?

179
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:08,815
-You can't run in front of me.

180
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:09,915
-What?

181
00:13:09,948 --> 00:13:11,748
-It's not a good idea
to get between them

182
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:12,948
because they're so big.

183
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:17,681
-Hey.

184
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:18,648
Here.

185
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:23,515
-I will not drink penal tea.

186
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:24,648
Get out of my way.

187
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:29,248
-I'm not gonna let you pass.

188
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:36,381
-Hey, hey, look at me.

189
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,415
See ya.

190
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:39,248
I'm definitely not
drinking that stuff.

191
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:41,681
-Eiji, you're gonna
drink it all right.

192
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:42,181
-Taka.

193
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,748
-I'm running just behind Taka
to reduce the wind resistance

194
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:50,781
until the third corner.

195
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:52,781
-Everyone's working
so hard not to lose

196
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,415
but it actually tastes good.

197
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:56,281
You really should try it Tezuka.

198
00:13:56,315 --> 00:13:57,048
-No thanks.

199
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,848
-Got a ways to go.

200
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:04,781
BOTH: Oh, Echizen, you little--

201
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:14,881
-Wow, everyone is even.

202
00:14:14,915 --> 00:14:15,848
-Looking good.

203
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:16,715
Come on, Ryoma.

204
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:17,415
You can do it.

205
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:20,648
-Everyone is so fast.

206
00:14:20,681 --> 00:14:23,515
-This works extremely well.

207
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:25,448
ALL: Here them come.

208
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:28,648
-It's about time for the finish
and the first runner to make it

209
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:29,915
to the last corner is--

210
00:14:36,415 --> 00:14:39,848
ALL: Look, it's Ryoma.

211
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,315
-Whoa, it's all of them.

212
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:52,748
-You all finished
at the same time.

213
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:53,981
-That was close.

214
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:55,081
I'm exhausted.

215
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:56,581
-Inui, for heaven's
sake, you've got

216
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:59,215
to stop threatening us
with that horrible drink.

217
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:01,648
-There's not a
winner nor a loser.

218
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,581
I wouldn't want
this to go to waste.

219
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:06,015
So why doesn't
everyone share it?

220
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:08,081
ALL: Hey, you drink it all!

221
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,581
-All right, thanks guys.

222
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:11,481
-See you tomorrow.

223
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:12,681
-I'm exhausted.

224
00:15:12,715 --> 00:15:15,048
-So Echizen, how's your injury?

225
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,281
-Hm?

226
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,015
-I'm so relieved your
injuries weren't too severe.

227
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,281
-Yeah.

228
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:22,081
-Hey, is anyone else hungry?

229
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:24,615
Why don't we all go and
get some hamburgers?

230
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:25,881
-Yeah, that's a great idea.

231
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:31,915
-Sorry, I can't
come with you guys.

232
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:32,681
-What?

233
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:33,781
You're not coming with us?

234
00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:37,981
-I have something I
have to take care of.

235
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:40,915
-Well, that sure
is mighty unusual.

236
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:43,581
-Taka is usually more sociable.

237
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:48,181
-Hey, maybe he's trying
to watch his budget.

238
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,981
-Watching his budget?

239
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,715
BOTH: These burgers are going
to be on you, of course, right?

240
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:56,115
Thanks for the burgers, Eiji.

241
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:57,981
-Aw, man, you guys
are really ruthless.

242
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:10,848
-Is that Taka over their
walking by himself?

243
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:11,348
[giggle]

244
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,915
-Looks like he's
going to see someone.

245
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:25,215
-Hm.

246
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:26,881
-He must have a date.

247
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:27,381
-Ahhh.

248
00:16:33,048 --> 00:16:34,681
-Hey, why are you following us?

249
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:37,248
-Don't ask me too
many questions now.

250
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:41,115
In any event, I have a feeling
I'll have some good data.

251
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:48,815
-What do you mean good data?

252
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:51,448
-Well, anyway, he was unclear
about what he was going to do

253
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:54,048
and who he was going to meet.

254
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:54,548
-Welcome.

255
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:01,448
-A girl?

256
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:14,481
Whoa.

257
00:17:17,748 --> 00:17:19,281
He's reducing her to tears.

258
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,381
I can't believe Taka did that.

259
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:26,481
-What's wrong with the
world these days anyhow?

260
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:28,848
-He's quite a guy.

261
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,681
-What kind of notes
are you taking?

262
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:32,181
-His personal data.

263
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:34,948
-There more to him
than meets the eye.

264
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:36,548
-Yeah, that's for sure.

265
00:17:36,581 --> 00:17:38,515
-Hello, thank you for waiting.

266
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:41,881
One super deluxe strawberry
chocolate sundae.

267
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:44,281
-Hey, kid, looks like
you ordered a yummy one.

268
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:45,981
-I'm gonna order
something as well.

269
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:47,881
-Yes, something to
eat would be nice.

270
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:49,415
-Here's our specials menu.

271
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:51,515
Please take a look, and
let we know what you like.

272
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:54,281
MOMO: Say no more,
I'll have one of these.

273
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:56,015
KIKUMARU: And I think
I'll have this one.

274
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:59,215
All of these go on
Taka's bill, right?

275
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:00,148
-Good idea.

276
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:01,481
And I think I'll
have another one.

277
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:17,281
-Hey, kid, what's
wrong with you?

278
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:18,815
RYOMA: Akutsu.

279
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:19,315
-What?

280
00:18:23,548 --> 00:18:24,915
INUI: Yes, he's the one.

281
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:29,848
-So that's the crazy guy?

282
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:32,548
-But what's he doing
here with Taka?

283
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:35,215
-Hey, Akutsu, why
don't you look at me?

284
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,848
-Hey, Jin.

285
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:43,848
-I haven't seen you since we
took karate classes together.

286
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:52,248
Well, we're not here to
talk about the old days.

287
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:55,515
I was told you came
over to my school today.

288
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:58,348
-So, I just stopped by
to say hello to everyone.

289
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:01,348
-I'm asking you not to
bother my teammates again.

290
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,615
-It's stupid to talk
about such things.

291
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:05,681
-Don't make Yuki worry anymore.

292
00:19:05,715 --> 00:19:06,715
YUKI: Jin, stop it.

293
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:17,681
-And don't even think
about ordering me around.

294
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:19,148
-Takashi, are you all right?

295
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,881
-But I'll let it
go, just this once.

296
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:27,781
For old time's sake.

297
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:30,115
-Jin, why'd you have
to go and do that?

298
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:35,348
-That's terrible.

299
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:41,948
Hey, Momo, you better not.

300
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:07,148
-Thank you for that
treat earlier today.

301
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:07,615
-Seigaku.

302
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:14,081
-I haven't introduced
myself yet.

303
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:17,281
I'm Ryoma Echizen, a
seventh grader at Seigaku.

304
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:19,313
Nice to meet you.

305
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:33,229
[theme music]

306
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:59,996
-Hi, I'm Katsuo Mizuno.

307
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,163
Everyday and in
every way, everyone

308
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:03,929
is training real
hard to get ready

309
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,663
for the Metropolitan Finals.

310
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:09,029
Ryoma and Fuji are
even going head to head

311
00:21:09,063 --> 00:21:10,396
in a practice match.

312
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:15,029
And Ryoma is having a hard
time against Fuji's new move.

313
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:19,563
Next on the "Prince of
Tennis, The Brown Bear."

314
00:21:19,596 --> 00:21:22,296
Don't they both look happy?
