00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:23,267
-Morning everyone.

00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:26,234
[theme music]

3
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:42,063
-Oh wow.

4
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:45,563
What a beautiful day.

5
00:01:45,596 --> 00:01:46,529
-Let's see.

6
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:49,796
Today I think I'll use-- Hm.

7
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,429
I'm all out.

8
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:53,796
GIRL: Oh, I'm sorry about that.

9
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:55,263
I used it all.

10
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:56,363
-What?

11
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:57,696
You used up all my toothpaste?

12
00:02:06,396 --> 00:02:07,329
-Hm.

13
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:09,763
[hiss]

14
00:02:13,863 --> 00:02:14,796
-Whoa.

15
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:17,396
You've built up
some muscles there.

16
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,829
-During the district
matches, there

17
00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:20,963
was this incredible
power player.

18
00:02:20,996 --> 00:02:22,529
I can't lose to him.

19
00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:24,463
-Good morning, Taka.

20
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:25,963
-Well, good morning, Oishi.

21
00:02:25,996 --> 00:02:27,929
Looks like you're
up early today.

22
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:29,563
-Look who's talking.

23
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:31,096
Thank you for the other day.

24
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:33,396
-Oh, if it was nothing.

25
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:35,229
[humming]

26
00:02:35,263 --> 00:02:36,663
[giggling]

27
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:37,596
-Quiet!

28
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,463
Eat your breakfast, will you?

29
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:40,929
GIRLS: OK!

30
00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:43,829
[alarm beeping]

31
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,096
-Good morning.

32
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:57,196
Sleep well?

33
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:57,996
-Just fine.

34
00:02:58,029 --> 00:02:59,229
-It's pretty weird.

35
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:03,396
You used to drag in the
morning, but not these days.

36
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:03,896
-Huh?

37
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:10,929
-Hey, mom!

38
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:13,296
-Your mom's left already.

39
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:15,596
She said that she had
a meeting or something.

40
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,063
-Huh?

41
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:20,563
-Next time, a Japanese
breakfast, Kay?

42
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:22,229
[meow]

43
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:22,929
-Oh.

44
00:03:22,963 --> 00:03:24,196
You're up too, Kalpin?

45
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:28,129
[meowing]

46
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,629
-Kalpin sure loves that toy.

47
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:32,496
I bet it's because you're
the one that gave it to him.

48
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:35,763
-I doubt it.

49
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:37,163
-OK, Kalpin.

50
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:38,629
I'll get you some food.

51
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:43,996
-Hm.

52
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:44,529
NANAKO: Ryoma?

53
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:45,863
-Hm?

54
00:03:45,896 --> 00:03:48,729
NANAKO: You're studying?

55
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:51,096
-Yeah, I have to get
ready for an English quiz

56
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:52,929
first period today.

57
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:55,663
I think it'll be
pretty easy, but I just

58
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:57,229
wanna make sure I
don't miss anything.

59
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:00,963
-Hm.

60
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:02,763
Your grade in English.

61
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:04,363
You don't want to fail.

62
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:06,496
Isn't that the truth?

63
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:09,063
-I never fail.

64
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:09,563
Huh?

65
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:14,196
I'm off.

66
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:15,196
-Knock them dead.

67
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:16,163
You'll do great.

68
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,596
[meow]

69
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:24,529
-Huh?

70
00:04:24,563 --> 00:04:25,496
Huh?

71
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:26,463
Kalpin!

72
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:27,929
[meow]

73
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:28,796
-Don't follow me.

74
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:29,629
Go home.

75
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:31,429
I'll play with you later.

76
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:34,663
[sad meow]

77
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:35,963
-Hey!

78
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:37,529
You're gonna be late!

79
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:38,796
-Look who's talking, Momo.

80
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:39,296
Hey!

81
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:50,429
-Oh, I hate this!

82
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:51,763
An English quiz in first period?

83
00:04:51,796 --> 00:04:52,896
-Huh?

84
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:56,663
-Hey, what's the matter?

85
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,029
Huh?

86
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:59,096
What's that you got there?

87
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:00,229
-Our cat's toy.

88
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:00,696
Kalpin's.

89
00:05:06,496 --> 00:05:07,996
-What's the matter, Echizen?

90
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:08,596
-It's nothing.

91
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:09,163
I--

92
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:10,429
-Oh, I get it.

93
00:05:10,463 --> 00:05:14,029
You're not so sure about a
little English quiz Ha ha!

94
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,329
Don't worry, me neither.

95
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,496
RYOMA (VOICEOVER):
Piece of cake.

96
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:41,096
-Huh?

97
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:41,996
What's the problem, Echizen?

98
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:50,496
Hm.

99
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:52,596
Looks like you're nearly
done with the quiz.

100
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:53,563
Here, go ahead.

101
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:55,396
Finish the last question.

102
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:56,763
-What?

103
00:05:56,796 --> 00:05:59,429
The last question?

104
00:05:59,463 --> 00:05:59,929
Huh.

105
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:01,029
What a shock.

106
00:06:01,063 --> 00:06:02,496
I did really badly on the quiz.

107
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,563
Hm.

108
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,996
RYOMA: You still got
a ways to go, Horio.

109
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,263
-Yeah, you know, you don't
have to show off there, Mr.

110
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:08,396
Straight-A's.

111
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:09,696
Huh?

112
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,796
What?

113
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:12,763
-Hello.

114
00:06:12,796 --> 00:06:14,796
-Hey, what are
you doing in here?

115
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:17,429
We have science class
in here next period.

116
00:06:17,463 --> 00:06:19,596
-I wanted to check
something on my latest

117
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,363
experiment during recess.

118
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:23,429
Don't worry.

119
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:25,463
I received permission
from the teacher.

120
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:27,063
-S-So what is it?

121
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:32,996
Whoa, it changed colors.

122
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,663
I don't think that's so good.

123
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:37,396
-It's going to be
my best drink ever.

124
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,163
Would you like to try it?

125
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:46,863
BOY: Shall I compare
thee to a summer's day?

126
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:50,429
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

127
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:53,663
Rough winds do shake the
darling buds of May--

128
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:54,463
-Eiji.

129
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:55,729
-Huh?

130
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:59,329
-Himalayan cats aren't
usually strays, are they?

131
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:00,896
-Himalayan cats aren't strays?

132
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:01,529
What's up?

133
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:02,763
TEACHER: Kikumaru.

134
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:05,163
Please continue.

135
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:06,896
-Yes, uh--

136
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:09,129
-Page 87, line 8.

137
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:10,396
-Thanks, dude.

138
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:12,296
Let's see, where were we?

139
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:14,463
By chance or nature's
changing course

140
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:17,529
untrimmed, but thy eternal
summer shall not fade.

141
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:27,729
-Teacher.

142
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:28,563
-Yes?

143
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:31,096
Uh, wh-- what is it, Tezuka?

144
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:32,863
-The third formula is incorrect.

145
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:33,929
Please check it.

146
00:07:33,963 --> 00:07:34,629
-Oh, huh?

147
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:53,263
[crunch]

148
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:54,763
-Huh?

149
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:55,563
Momoshiro.

150
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:56,396
-(MUMBLING) Yes sir!

151
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:57,596
-Again with the eating.

152
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:59,963
Well, if you don't get at
least a 90 on your test,

153
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:01,029
you will take it over.

154
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:01,763
-(MUMBLING) What?

155
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:02,863
You can't do that.

156
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:27,329
-Meow?

157
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:30,063
[meowing]

158
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,596
-Hey, lady!

159
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:38,163
I would like a melon bun, a
curry bun, and a fried noodle

160
00:08:38,196 --> 00:08:38,963
bun.

161
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:39,929
-I got it.

162
00:08:39,963 --> 00:08:41,396
Now go stand in line.

163
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,663
-Aw.

164
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,763
And add in a blueberry juice, K?

165
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:46,096
-All right, all right!

166
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:48,229
-She sure had some nerve.

167
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:50,663
She polished off every last
bit of my favorite tube

168
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,263
of toothpaste.

169
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:00,996
-Hey, there you are.

170
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,929
-What do you think that is?

171
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:08,829
[curious whispering]

172
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,929
-Hey, what you doing, Echizen?

173
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:11,796
-Nothing.

174
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:12,763
-It's lunch time.

175
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:15,929
Let's go eat.

176
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:17,963
RYOMA (VOICEOVER): That
was Kalpin, wasn't it?

177
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,144
-Wow!

178
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:38,814
You're good, Sakuno.

179
00:09:38,814 --> 00:09:41,981
-My grandma taught me all
her great baking secrets.

180
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:42,781
GIRL: What?

181
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:45,348
You mean scary Mrs. Ryuzaki?

182
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:47,681
She's not always scary.

183
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:49,881
She also loves to make cakes.

184
00:09:49,914 --> 00:09:50,481
-Really?

185
00:09:50,514 --> 00:09:52,281
-Can I have one?

186
00:09:52,314 --> 00:09:52,781
-Sure.

187
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:53,348
-Oh!

188
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:54,614
Just a minute!

189
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:57,214
-Echizen, why are you
eating so quickly?

190
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,681
TOMOKA: Ryoma!

191
00:09:58,714 --> 00:09:59,748
-Hm?

192
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:02,981
-Hey, Ryoma, we brought
something for you!

193
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:04,448
Oh, Ryoma, look!

194
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:06,881
Check it out!

195
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:07,848
HORIO: Oh, wow.

196
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:09,114
These look great.

197
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:10,848
Did you really make these?

198
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:12,814
-Um, it's not that difficult.

199
00:10:12,848 --> 00:10:14,081
You bake 'em.

200
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,281
-Go, Ryoma, go!

201
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,114
We brought these to
fortify you for tomorrow!

202
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:19,448
-I'll have one.

203
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:20,314
-Not so fast!

204
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:21,314
-Why not?

205
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:23,581
-These are for Ryoma,
and nobody else.

206
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:24,314
-Don't be so mean.

207
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:25,781
I just want one.

208
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:27,048
-Hey, Echizen.

209
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:27,714
Wow!

210
00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:28,914
Look what you've got!

211
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:29,481
-Hey, look.

212
00:10:29,514 --> 00:10:30,148
It's Momoshiro.

213
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:31,481
-I want one, too.

214
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:32,181
-Go right ahead.

215
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,448
-Why does he get one?

216
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:35,248
I asked before, and you said no.

217
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:36,514
-It's OK.

218
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,681
He's allowed because he's
always helping Ryoma out.

219
00:10:38,714 --> 00:10:39,181
-No way.

220
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:46,148
-Hey, what's wrong with you?

221
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:47,214
-Hey there, Momo.

222
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:47,781
-Hm?

223
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,414
-Give me that.

224
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,781
-What?

225
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:52,748
-You know, i really have no
idea what's gotten into that boy

226
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:53,281
lately.

227
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:54,248
-Yeah.

228
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:56,048
Echizen's been
acting mighty weird.

229
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:56,981
-What do yo mean?

230
00:10:57,014 --> 00:10:58,714
Did something happen to him?

231
00:10:58,748 --> 00:11:01,981
-Well, if anyone would know,
it would most certainly be me.

232
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:04,481
Besides, I've already
had two years of tennis.

233
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:06,548
-That has nothing to do with it.

234
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:41,981
[meow]

235
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:44,081
-Let's have lunch here.

236
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:45,214
Ah!

237
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:46,648
Whoa, what was that?

238
00:11:57,781 --> 00:12:01,414
-I'm really sorry to do this
at recess, but let's vote.

239
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:02,581
All those in favor?

240
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:03,081
-Aye.

241
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:03,581
-No way.

242
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:04,848
Forget it.

243
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:06,314
[school bells]

244
00:12:06,348 --> 00:12:09,148
[chatter]

245
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:15,314
-You're here early.

246
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:17,214
What's going on?

247
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:18,548
What's the matter?

248
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:19,048
-Nothing.

249
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:26,014
-Hm.

250
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:29,248
So, uh, Echizen, are you
worried about something?

251
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,481
-Sort of.

252
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:32,648
-Yep, I thought
there was something.

253
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:34,914
Horio also mentioned that
you're not your normal self.

254
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:40,214
-It's our cat.

255
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:41,481
-Your cat?

256
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:43,048
-I think he's at school.

257
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:44,348
-Did he follow you?

258
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:45,248
-No.

259
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:46,481
That can't be.

260
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:48,081
It's way too far.

261
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:50,848
-Now that you're bringing
it up, a girl in my class

262
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:54,381
said she saw a white
raccoon on the roof.

263
00:12:54,414 --> 00:12:58,648
You don't think that maybe
that raccoon is your cat?

264
00:12:58,681 --> 00:12:59,381
Oh, hey.

265
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:08,914
-Uh, I'll go and
look on the roof!

266
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:10,281
-Wait just a minute.

267
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:12,081
She saw him at lunch.

268
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:15,148
There's no way that your
cat's gonna still be up there.

269
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:16,548
-Well, maybe.

270
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:17,581
But he's somewhere.

271
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:18,648
-Here.

272
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:19,981
You can borrow my bike.

273
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:22,214
Why don't you take a good
look around on your way home,

274
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:23,381
and see if you can find him?

275
00:13:23,414 --> 00:13:23,948
-Huh?

276
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:25,314
-Don't worry.

277
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:27,448
Cats are always roaming
around in weird places

278
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:28,781
you'd never expect.

279
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:31,848
-But Kalpin hardly
ever leaves home.

280
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:34,681
-Well, that's why you better
go out and look for him.

281
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:38,581
He could be home by now.

282
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:39,681
It's a sure thing.

283
00:13:39,714 --> 00:13:41,848
You should take care
of your worries first.

284
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:43,981
Mm-hm.

285
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:45,214
Get going, Echizen.

286
00:13:49,314 --> 00:13:52,548
-Momo, I promise I'll
repay you for this someday.

287
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,714
-No problem at all.

288
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:56,481
Come back as soon as you can.

289
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:01,481
-Is Echizen here?

290
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:04,948
-Well, apparently there's some
sort of family celebration,

291
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:06,914
so he had to go home for a few.

292
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:08,481
He said he'd be right back.

293
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,614
-I wish I'd known.

294
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,981
I was planning to
end practice early.

295
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:14,714
The metropolitans are tomorrow.

296
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:20,348
-Kalpin?

297
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:21,314
[meow]

298
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:35,014
[meowing]

299
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:36,014
-Hey.

300
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:37,048
Who left the door open?

301
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:37,548
Huh?

302
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:53,114
-Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk,tsk.

303
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:56,081
Hm?

304
00:14:56,114 --> 00:14:57,948
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER):
What's it doing?

305
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:58,648
Oh, well.

306
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:09,148
[humming]

307
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:19,981
-Here, here, kitty.

308
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:22,981
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

309
00:15:23,014 --> 00:15:23,948
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

310
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:29,314
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

311
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:30,548
Come on.

312
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:31,448
Come on, you.

313
00:15:36,814 --> 00:15:38,748
[meow]

314
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:39,681
-Come on.

315
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:41,081
Come on.

316
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:41,581
Come on.

317
00:15:41,614 --> 00:15:42,748
[meow]

318
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:44,048
-Come on.

319
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:46,548
Come on.

320
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:47,348
Here.

321
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:47,914
Come on.

322
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,114
Don't give up.

323
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:49,914
Come on.

324
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,114
Over here.

325
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:52,514
Over here.

326
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:56,681
[laughter]

327
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:57,614
-Hm.

328
00:15:57,648 --> 00:15:59,814
Kaidoh is usually
never this late.

329
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:00,681
-Hm.

330
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:02,914
He'll need to do
some extra laps.

331
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:03,581
-Oh.

332
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:04,414
Speak of the devil.

333
00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:08,714
-Hello.

334
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:09,214
-Hey.

335
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:13,981
-He's in a good mood.

336
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:14,548
-What?

337
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:16,114
-You can tell?

338
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:16,881
Well done.

339
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:17,548
BOY: Good job, everybody.

340
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:18,381
BOY: Good practice.

341
00:16:18,414 --> 00:16:19,181
-Yeah.

342
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:20,348
-Bye, see you later, Oishi.

343
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:22,481
-You're going home like that?

344
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,614
-I'd hate it if they ran out.

345
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:25,848
-Mm.

346
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:27,314
He's so impatient.

347
00:16:27,348 --> 00:16:28,981
-Man, you're in great shape.

348
00:16:29,014 --> 00:16:31,581
-Yeah, not too bad, I guess.

349
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:33,681
-Give this to Ryoma, will you?

350
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:34,981
And then I want to to--

351
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:39,148
-Well, looks to me like Ryoma
wasn't able to come back.

352
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:39,981
Huh?

353
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:41,248
What's going on?

354
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:42,581
-Momo, come and see!

355
00:16:42,614 --> 00:16:45,148
In the clubhouse,
there's this big raccoon!

356
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:45,681
-A raccoon?

357
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:49,314
Huh?

358
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:04,581
-Hey, kitty.

359
00:17:04,614 --> 00:17:05,381
Want a fish?

360
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:06,214
-Hm.

361
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:08,848
He doesn't seem real interested.

362
00:17:08,881 --> 00:17:09,414
-Bye.

363
00:17:09,448 --> 00:17:10,448
So long, guys.

364
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:13,881
[honking]

365
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:16,114
-Shusuke, want a ride home?

366
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,014
-Oh, hey, sis.

367
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,014
Well, I'll see you guys.

368
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:19,948
-'Til tomorrow.

369
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:23,081
-Yeah, these feel terrific.

370
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:23,714
I want them.

371
00:17:23,748 --> 00:17:25,648
How much are they?

372
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:27,214
-Well, let's see.

373
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:30,214
For you, that will be
12,000 yen plus tax.

374
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:33,214
Let's see what I've got.

375
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:36,081
Oh no, I'm 80 yen short!

376
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:37,048
-Eiji?

377
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:39,781
-Oh, Oishi.

378
00:17:39,814 --> 00:17:41,081
Oh, please can I borrow 80 yen?

379
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:41,881
Do you have 80 yen?

380
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:42,648
I'm 80 yen short.

381
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:43,848
Oh please, oh please.

382
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:45,214
-You need 80 yen?

383
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:51,748
-Did you find him, Ryoma?

384
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:52,514
-Not yet.

385
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:54,181
I'll check back at school.

386
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:55,148
-Ryoma!

387
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:56,114
-Hm?

388
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:57,014
-We'll find him.

389
00:17:57,048 --> 00:17:58,548
I know he'll turn up eventually.

390
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:05,081
-Hey there.

391
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,514
Come on, Echizen.

392
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,281
Look here.

393
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:22,348
-Thanks.

394
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,314
-Here, this is from the coach.

395
00:18:24,348 --> 00:18:25,281
-Thanks, captain.

396
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:26,914
-I'll just leave your bag here.

397
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:29,948
-You get some rest, all right?

398
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:31,148
-Hope the party was great.

399
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:31,648
-Huh?

400
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:34,081
The party?

401
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,414
What does he mean by that, huh?

402
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,814
Oh yeah.

403
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:38,581
-Huh?

404
00:18:38,614 --> 00:18:39,948
-Hey wanna hit some balls?

405
00:18:39,981 --> 00:18:41,581
I owe you one, after all.

406
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:42,814
-Hm.

407
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:47,381
So Echizen wants to pay
me back with a match.

408
00:18:47,414 --> 00:18:49,214
I can't wait for the metros.

409
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:51,548
I'll tear up the courts.

410
00:18:51,581 --> 00:18:52,414
-Oh?

411
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:55,814
I don't think so,
Momo, my friend.

412
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:57,648
It'll be me tearing
up the courts!

413
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,614
-Wow.

414
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,414
It's that brand new toothpaste.

415
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:13,048
-I'm sorry I used up yours.

416
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:15,914
-Thank you, sis!

417
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:17,181
-Shusuke.

418
00:19:17,214 --> 00:19:19,514
So, do you want me to predict
the outcome of the Metro

419
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:20,281
matches?

420
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:21,448
-Sure.

421
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:22,981
But if I remember
correctly, your predictions

422
00:19:23,014 --> 00:19:24,181
are always right on the mark.

423
00:19:24,214 --> 00:19:25,081
It's kinda scary.

424
00:19:37,748 --> 00:19:38,514
-Hey, Takashi.

425
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:39,614
Go to bed.

426
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:40,614
-OK.

427
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:42,114
-Tomorrow morning, don't worry.

428
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:43,514
You don't have to help me.

429
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:44,514
-What?

430
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:45,448
That would mess me up.

431
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:45,981
I gotta help.

432
00:19:55,614 --> 00:19:58,648
-Echizen's shots sure had a
lot of power to them today.

433
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:13,148
-Night, Kalpin.

434
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:20,981
And soon, it will be the morning
of the Metropolitan Tournament.

435
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:27,648
[theme music]

436
00:20:55,348 --> 00:20:56,548
-Hey, hey.

437
00:20:56,582 --> 00:20:58,282
It's nice to see you again.

438
00:20:58,315 --> 00:21:01,648
I'm Horio, with two years
of tennis experience.

439
00:21:01,682 --> 00:21:04,282
The Metropolitan Tournament
is finally starting,

440
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:08,748
and those guys are nervous
just hearing the name Seigaku.

441
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:10,415
But Echizen sure is late.

442
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:12,215
He's tardy without a doubt.

443
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:13,615
But hey, no way.

444
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,048
You can't ask me to do that.

445
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:16,515
That's crazy.

446
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:18,415
Next on "The Prince of Tennis."

447
00:21:18,448 --> 00:21:21,215
A new regular appears?

448
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:22,215
Oh yeah!

449
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:25,115
Looks like my time
has finally come.
