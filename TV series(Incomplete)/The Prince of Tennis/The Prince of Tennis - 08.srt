Let's continue.

00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:15,083
What do you think?

5
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:18,483
Should I give you a handicap?

6
00:00:18,516 --> 00:00:19,083
-No need to.

7
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,749
-Staying on your toes, eh?

8
00:00:26,783 --> 00:00:27,783
Where'd you learn that?

9
00:00:27,816 --> 00:00:29,816
-Why don't you mind
your own business?

10
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:30,916
-You're no fun.

11
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:32,716
Why don't you relax,
and ease up a little?

12
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:34,249
-Get on with it, and serve.

13
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:35,249
-Hah.

14
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:37,749
Act tough, and
you'll only be sorry.

SPECTATOR: I can't believe it.

20
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,010
Ryoma lost his serve.

21
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,244
-Well, you know it's not
so easy to make changes

22
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:11,844
in your style of play,
especially when you're

23
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:13,677
under that much pressure.

24
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,977
You try new stuff over and
over, but your opponent

25
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,110
is there waiting.

26
00:02:17,144 --> 00:02:18,944
And any normal
player would probably

27
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:22,410
panic, and self-destruct
right about now.

28
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:24,677
-You know, you're
really pretty good.

29
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,310
It's apparent that
you've instinctively

30
00:02:26,344 --> 00:02:28,044
calculated my reach and height.

31
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:31,477
And you always seem to
take aim just beyond it.

32
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,244
You may have more
talent than I do.

33
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:35,210
And you're definitely
stronger than you look.

34
00:02:35,244 --> 00:02:38,310
However, as long as I know where
you're going to hit the ball

35
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:43,610
there's no shot I can't return,
no matter how good it is.

36
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:46,473
-Oh!

37
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,005
-There's no doubt that
one day, you'll become

38
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:56,438
a Seigaku regular,
but not today.

39
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:57,905
Because I'm going to win.

40
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,405
-You still have a ways to go.

41
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:04,505
-Hmm?

42
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:05,005
-Oh!

43
00:03:12,338 --> 00:03:14,472
-I'm glad I enrolled
at Seigaku, because it

44
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:16,705
means I can beat all
kinds of tennis players.

45
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:48,538
-What does he mean he can beat--

46
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:50,638
-All kinds of tennis players?

47
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:51,972
-Ryoma's going to come back.

48
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:53,972
He's going to turn this
match right on its head.

-Huh?

50
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:06,938
Hmm.

51
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:14,838
-I just got the hang of
this footwork recently.

52
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:16,338
It's more complicated
than it looks.

53
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:18,905
You know, I wanted to keep
it a secret from everyone

54
00:04:18,938 --> 00:04:24,738
around here, at least until
the national tournament.

-That's so cool.

Can you eve believe it?

-The national tournament?

61
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,305
He's not running
short on confidence.

62
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:37,638
-Mr. Inoue, I think
I've finally decided.

63
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:38,972
-Decided what?

64
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:41,938
-From now on, I'm going to
focus on Ryoma Echizen in depth.

65
00:04:41,972 --> 00:04:43,105
-What, in depth?

67

student would say something

it a secret from everyone

00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:51,772
until the national tournament.

-Hey, cut that out.

-What's it to you what I do?

75
00:04:57,705 --> 00:04:59,672
-If you're thinking of
doing a story on Ryoma,

76
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:01,738
you're going to have
to go through me.

77
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:04,172
I'm the president of
his Official Fan Club,

78
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:04,972
you got that?

79
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,272
-Huh, official fan club?

80
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:08,405
-Wanna join?

81
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:09,872
-I'm not interested in
joining his fan club.

82
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:12,405
I just want to let
tennis fans nationwide

83
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,772
know what makes Ryoma
so special and adorable.

84
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:16,238
-You just called him adorable!

85
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:17,672
How dare you do that?

86
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:20,138
I won't allow you to
do a story on him!

87
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:21,405
-Calm down, Tomo.

88
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:23,038
The game's about to begin.

-(THINKING) The
national tournament?

91
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:35,305
You're kidding me.

92
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:43,572
Ah!

93
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:45,772
Now, which way will you hit?

94
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:48,138
The probability is--

95
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:49,238
-Isn't it a bother?

96
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:51,705
How about if I save
you all that trouble?

97
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:53,238
I'm doing it this
one to the right.

-What?

104
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:12,405
Why is Echizen telling him
where he's going to hit it?

105
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,305
He's making it easy for
Sadaharu to return his shots.

-Next one's right.

107

This was bound to happen.

110

He's returning everything.

00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:32,172
-Don't you see what's going on?

112
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:36,472
Ryoma is getting into position
at the same time as Sadaharu.

-Behind you.

attack on the same course.

00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:25,022
It was barely outside the line.

122
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:27,455
-Sadaharu couldn't have
gotten to it if he tried.

123
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,089
-You're right.

124
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:29,255
Ryoma's doing great.

better than he was before.

128
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:36,155
He's too cool for words.

129
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,022
-I think he's using
the split step.

130
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:41,055
-I overdid it a bit.

131
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:43,022
I've still got to work on it.

132
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:45,389
I've got to hand it to
you, though, Sadaharu.

133
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,055
You knew that was
going out, didn't you?

134
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:53,189
-Hmm.

135

that I didn't move.

could compete against

00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:19,955
Interesting.

142
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:22,055
What data will you
show me this time?

143
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:23,255
I can't wait to find out.

What do you think?

00:09:17,855 --> 00:09:20,922
Should I give you handicap?

mind your own business?

and ease up a little?

What a shame.

164
00:10:02,655 --> 00:10:05,455
All that youthful energy wasted,
because the ball lands just

outside the line.

talking to here, son?

00:10:59,255 --> 00:10:59,722
-Mhmm.

184
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:05,355
-How can you play tennis without
knowing about the split step?

185
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:07,455
Just ask me about
it, and I'll tell you

186
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:09,022
everything you need
to know for sure.

187
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:10,389
SPECTATOR: Can you do it?

188
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:11,455
-Of course I can.

189
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:13,055
I've been playing
tennis for two years.

190
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,289
I can do anything.

191
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:17,255
The split step is one of
the fundamentals of tennis.

192
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:19,189
You jump up lightly,
just as your opponent

193
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:21,289
hits a volley, and
land on the ground

194
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:22,822
with the toes of both feet.

195
00:11:22,855 --> 00:11:25,122
That makes your reaction
time to the ball

196
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:28,022
a half step faster as
you take your next step.

197
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:28,689
-Really?

198
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,055
Amazing.

199
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,989
-But how does that speed up
your reaction time to the ball?

200
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:35,722
-Well, you know, it's kind
of sort of like faster.

201
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:36,889
Fuji, you tell them.

202
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:38,422
-It produces a spring
in your muscles

203
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:40,622
that lets you accelerate as
you rush to hit the ball.

204
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:42,189
-A spring in your muscles?

205
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:43,122
What do you mean?

206
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:44,589
-If you're a half
step faster, you

207
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:46,955
can get to a ball that's one
meter farther away than you

208
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:48,222
normally could.

209
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:49,955
So Ryoma is actually
moving faster

210
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:52,489
than Sadaharu's predictions.

211
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:55,289
-Boy, you guys are so
knowledgeable about tennis.

212
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:58,244
-If only the same
could be said for you.

213
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,455
15-all.

214
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:07,722
[gasps]

215
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:08,922
-(THINKING) Split step.

216
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,460
-Next, I'll be hitting it to
the right, then attack the net.

217
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:35,860
-He's on the offensive now.

218
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:37,227
-Way to go, Ryoma!

219
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,027
-[sigh]

220
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,360
-He's so fast.

221
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:43,127
-The split step has sped up
his normal reaction time.

222
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,627
And he's not even
doing it right.

223
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,327
Ryoma's doing a variation on
the traditional split step.

224
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,960
Usually, you're supposed
to land on both feet.

225
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:56,860
But Ryoma lands on one foot.

226
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,827
He's already in position.

227
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,693
-Left.

228
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:05,093
-I had that one predicted.

229
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,760
-Oh no!

230
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:12,560
He can't reach it.

231
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:14,027
-Hmm.

232
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,493
Hmm?

233
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:17,427
-Next one's left, too.

234
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:17,960
-Wow.

235
00:13:17,993 --> 00:13:20,893
Ryoma's amazing.

236
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:22,160
-Coming right.

237
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:24,793
-(THINKING) There's a 95%
probability that he'll go

238
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:25,293
right.

239
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:30,327
Yes.

240
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,227
As I predicted.

241
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:41,493
And now-- oh!

242
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:43,293
-Oh!

243
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:45,427
-15-30.

244
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,360
[sighs]

245
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,027
-Sadaharu is losing.

246
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,160
-I can't believe it.

247
00:13:50,193 --> 00:13:51,360
-What's happening?

248
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:52,093
-Oh, unbelievable.

249
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:53,293
-He did it!

250
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:55,527
Ryoma won the point!

251
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,860
[interposing voices]

252
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:58,227
-Hmm?

253
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,727
-Oh, Ryoma.

254
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,793
-Ryoma's rhythm is
getting faster now.

255
00:14:02,827 --> 00:14:05,127
He's playing to the beat
of his split step rhythm.

256
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,227
His step goes far
beyond the basics.

257
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,060
I've never seen
anything like it.

258
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:10,493
That kid's lots of fun.

259
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:11,560
-But hang on a second.

260
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:13,327
Landing on one foot
makes him quicker.

261
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,727
But unless he knows where his
opponent is going to hit it,

262
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
it's no use.

263
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:18,893
And if he comes down
on the wrong foot,

264
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:21,427
it's going to be a
disadvantage, right?

265
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,060
His feet would get
all crossed up.

266
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:24,860
And he'd fall flat on the court.

267
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:26,627
I can't figure out
how he does it.

268
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,960
There must be some
kind of trick.

269
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,760
Does Echizen have data that
predicts Sadaharu's shots?

270
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:34,027
-No way.

271
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,927
Only someone like Sadaharu
plays that kind of tennis.

272
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,093
-Then how is Ryoma doing it?

273
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:42,327
-Well, it looks like he's making
his decisions as he jumps.

274
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,827
You see, that makes him quicker
not just by half a step,

275
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,493
but by a step and a half.

276
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:48,627
-One and a half steps?

277
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,360
-That much?

278
00:14:49,393 --> 00:14:50,593
-One and a half steps?

279
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:51,627
That's a huge advantage.

280
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,860
-Uh huh.

281
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,227
-That's his secret.

282
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,027
His added quickness allows him
to reach unreachable shots.

283
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,260
-Yah!

284
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,059
Go get it, kid.

285
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,959
How's this?

286
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:19,459
-Huh?

287
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:43,459
-Woo-hoo-hoo.

288
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:45,159
Gotcha that time, kid.

289
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:47,092
You fell right into my trap.

290
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:48,226
-Give me a break.

291
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:49,792
You're so immature.

292
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:57,892
-Put you in your place,
didn't I? [laughing] Sorry.

293
00:15:57,926 --> 00:15:59,659
I'll keep you company
until dinner time.

294
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:04,926
All right, kid.

295
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,526
Try this.

296
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:10,492
-I told you to get serious.

297
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:12,392
Uh!

298
00:16:12,426 --> 00:16:13,192
Heading left.

299
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:14,392
-(THINKING) This kid's fast.

300
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:21,426
[grunting]

301
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:22,426
CALLER: Game to Echizen.

302
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,192
Game to Inui.

303
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:29,759
Game to Echizen.

304
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,426
Game to Echizen.

305
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:31,892
-Right.

306
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,259
-Yeah.

307
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:40,792
-What a split step.

308
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:43,059
Unless you have
considerable natural talent,

309
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:45,226
that technique is
impossible to master.

310
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:47,026
And for a seventh grade
player to have done

311
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,726
it is almost unbelievable.

312
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,626
-Are you telling us that
Ryoma is a genuine prodigy?

313
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:52,692
-Of course he is.

314
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:55,259
If my Ryoma isn't a
genuine tennis prodigy,

315
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:56,726
then nobody around here is.

316
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,692
-Listen, you.

317
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,259
You've been calling
him your Ryoma.

318
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:00,659
Well it's not you Ryoma.

319
00:17:00,692 --> 00:17:02,059
So why don't you just pipe down?

320
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:03,059
-Oh yeah?

321
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:04,159
What's wrong with
calling him that?

322
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:05,292
Ryoma is my prince.

323
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:07,626
-Are you kidding me?
(MIMICKING) Oh, Ryoma.

324
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,292
He's my darling prince.

325
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:10,892
-You only wish you
could call him that.

326
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:11,759
But you can't.

327
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,092
Because only fan
club members are

328
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:14,726
allowed to call Ryoma Prince.

329
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,092
REPORTER: What's the big deal?

330
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:18,392
[interposing voices]

331
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:19,459
-What's up with them?

332
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:20,926
-Why are they arguing?

333
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,592
-Just leave them alone.

334
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,359
-Sadaharu must think
that he's playing

335
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:26,559
against a totally
different person right now.

336
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,859
-Well, back to business.

337
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:40,392
I never thought I'd run into
another player whose shots I

338
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,426
could predict but not return.

339
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:43,559
It's not over.

340
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:45,726
If I calculate all
the probabilities,

341
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,959
taking into account the
current game pattern,

342
00:17:47,992 --> 00:17:50,892
weather conditions, and
energy loss owing to fatigue,

343
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:53,426
I can still win.

344
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:56,259
-Hmm, Sadaharu's
one tough opponent.

345
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:57,559
-OK, here we go.

346
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:01,859
Huh?

347
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:04,059
(THINKING) He switched
to his right hand.

348
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:06,292
Is he really going to
serve right-handed?

349
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:10,826
[gasps]

350
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:13,059
-Oh, I get what he's doing.

351
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,792
-Hey Sadaharu.

352
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:24,326
Here's one more shot you
may be able to predict,

353
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,092
but you won't be able to return.

354
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:29,826
-(THINKING) Predict
but not return?

355
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,292
A right-handed serve.

356
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:57,626
He's trying to trick me.

357
00:18:57,659 --> 00:18:59,126
But I won't be fooled.

358
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:05,092
Oh!

359
00:19:11,126 --> 00:19:12,592
-He did it!

360
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:14,892
He used his kick serve!

361
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:17,426
-[gasp]

362
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:19,992
[sound of amazement]

363
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:20,692
-Yahoo!

364
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:21,926
Ryoma's going to win!

365
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,992
-Now that he's using
his kick serve.

366
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:26,792
--[panting] (THINKING)
Kick serve?

367
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:29,359
He has to use his
right hand to hit it.

368
00:19:29,392 --> 00:19:30,726
But wait.

369
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:33,992
What if he could hit a shot
like that with his weak hand?

370
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:36,426
What if this kid is
really that good?

371
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:50,145
-I'm not as strong
using my right hand.

372
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:57,911
But I'm aiming for it to go
straight towards your glasses.

373
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:06,378
-Mm.

374
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:06,878
-Ah!

375
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:26,311
[music playing]

376
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:02,640
ICHI: Hiya, I'm Seigaku
ninth grader, Ichi Kikumaru.

377
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:05,340
With the regulars decided,
the Seigaku tennis team

378
00:21:05,373 --> 00:21:07,440
begins full training for
the metro tournament.

379
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:08,273
Huh?

380
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:10,506
Sadaharu's going to coach us?

381
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,506
Give us a break.

382
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,440
What is that, a special drink?

383
00:21:16,473 --> 00:21:20,173
Ugh, it's disgusting,
and tastes bad.

384
00:21:20,206 --> 00:21:23,073
-Next on "Prince of
Tennis: The Hard Day."

385
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:25,206
Drink it up.
