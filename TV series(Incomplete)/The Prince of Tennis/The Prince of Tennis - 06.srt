1
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:10,259
-Come on, let's go!

2
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:12,225
-Hurry up, hurry!

3
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:13,225
-OK.

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,192
-One more time.

5
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:14,992
-See?

6
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:16,159
-Wait, you have to back up.

7
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:17,159
-That's good.

8
00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:18,625
-No, that was low.

9
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:19,559
-Hey, Sakuno.

10
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:20,559
-Hey there, Tomo.

11
00:00:20,592 --> 00:00:21,725
What's up?

12
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:23,959
-You've got to do
something about your swing.

13
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:25,792
You haven't made any progress.

14
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,059
-But, I'm trying.

15
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:28,259
-No excuses.

16
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:29,625
Listen to me, Sakuno.

17
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:32,725
I know if you ever want to be
good at tennis, form counts.

18
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,892
You have to play like Ryoma.

19
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:40,525
-That's not possible.

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,559
-Don't say that.

21
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:42,425
You can do it.

22
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,425
Now cheer up and
keep practicing.

23
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:47,425
See you later, buh-bye.

24
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:50,159
-If only I had Ryoma's form.

25
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:08,474
-Hmm, that sounds
like a good idea.

26
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:10,574
-Echizen's victory
over Kaido left

27
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:12,241
are the regulars
feeling on edge,

28
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:13,907
but that can be a good thing.

29
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:17,248
If we can keep the adrenalin
flowing through the sectionals,

30
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:18,882
our team is bound to do well.

31
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:21,549
-You seem to have taken a
liking to little Echizen.

32
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:23,849
-No, first I have to have to
see how good he really is.

33
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:25,782
That's what I'm going to match
up with as many players as

34
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:27,515
possible to see
what he's made of.

35
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:30,182
-My, my, you're very
demanding, aren't you?

36
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:33,982
-It's expected of me
as the team's captain.

37
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,782
-Grandma!

38
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:36,449
-Hot!

39
00:02:36,482 --> 00:02:37,082
What is it, Sakuno?

40
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,582
What can't wait?

41
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:39,849
-Oh, sorry.

42
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:43,182
Um, I haven't seen Ryoma
around anywhere at all today.

43
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:44,715
-So?

44
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:45,949
-That's all.

45
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:47,449
I just hate him.

46
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:49,382
-Are you interested in him?

47
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:50,449
-Oh, no!

48
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:52,215
It's nothing like
that, really, at all.

49
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:55,049
I just wanted to copy his form,
so I could improve my game.

50
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:56,615
-You know, get better?

51
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:58,582
Echizen doesn't
have a match today,

52
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:00,115
but that boy is
hooked on tennis,

53
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:02,682
so he won't be without is
racket even on an off day,

54
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:06,149
you know what I'm saying?

55
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:08,282
Ask, yourself where
could he practice even

56
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:09,849
without a partner.

57
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:11,415
I didn't know there
was any place you

58
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:15,349
could practice
without a partner.

59
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:18,715
-We're going to Nanjiro
Echizen's house?

60
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:20,382
But we don't have
an appointment,

61
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:22,349
and we don't know if
he's the right Echizen.

62
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:24,915
-Don't worry, trust
my reporters instinct

63
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:26,149
-Oh really?

64
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:27,382
Wait a minute, what's this?

65
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,949
-Exactly what it looks like.

66
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:31,315
-It looks like a
card for autographs.

67
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:31,815
Really.

68
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:37,882
-There's nothing to do.

69
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:39,082
-It can't be helped!

70
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,782
There's a ranking
tournament in progress,

71
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:43,115
and we are, as of yet, unranked.

72
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:47,149
-Aww, I just can't wait until
I become one of the regulars.

73
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:50,482
-Hey stupid, stop chatting
and watch the game carefully

74
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:55,449
Tomisero. you know anything you
say if you can call me Momo.

75
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:59,115
-Now pay attention, watch
their forming techniques.

76
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:01,382
You can pick up quite a few
things just by watching.

77
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:09,749
Keep your eyes wide open
and watch carefully.

78
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,015
Just like that guy is
standing right over there.

79
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:13,549
-Huh?

80
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:15,315
Oh, it's Suharu.

81
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:17,215
-Yeah, he plays Echison next.

82
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:35,482
-Look at him.

83
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:37,182
He's so intense.

84
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:38,149
-Yeah!

85
00:04:38,182 --> 00:04:40,082
-Oh, I know.

86
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:42,315
Thank you, grandma-ma.

87
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,215
-My goodness. what a child.

88
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:45,715
-Throughout history,
there have been

89
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:47,482
several extraordinary
players who've

90
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:51,449
been incredibly charismatic
on court, as well as off.

91
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:54,115
It is charisma that fascinates.

92
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:55,715
-Charisma, is it?

93
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:03,415
-Yes?

94
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,815
-My name is Inoue from
Monthly Pro Tennis.

95
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:07,715
I spoke to you on
the phone at noon.

96
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:09,649
I'm here to see your husband.

97
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,815
-Oh, just one moment, please.

98
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,382
-If he's the real
deal, then he's

99
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:16,549
probably going to be scary and
very difficult to deal with.

100
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,982
-We'll find that out when
we meet him, now won't we?

101
00:05:19,015 --> 00:05:22,149
-But his name is Nantaro
Echizen, Nantaro!

102
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:23,549
-No, it's Nanjiro.

103
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:26,049
-Fine, what difference
does it make anyway?

104
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:27,315
It's a cinch.

105
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:29,149
He's going to be at least
100 times more reticent

106
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:30,449
than his son, Ryoma.

107
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:32,115
And his eyes are
going to be narrow.

108
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:34,249
And they're going to
have a big glint in them.

109
00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:37,315
Oh no, Mr. Inoue, please, I'm
scared, I'm scared of him!

110
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:39,782
-Shiba, cut it out, this
is no time for games.

111
00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:43,715
It's W-O-R-K. Pull
yourself together now.

112
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:45,582
-Thank you for waiting.

113
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:47,715
-Who are you?

114
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:50,415
My name is Nanako
and I'm not his wife.

115
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:53,315
My uncle is staying in a
temple behind our house.

116
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:54,782
-Oh, I see.

117
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,982
Thank you very
much, Miss Nanako.

118
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:59,315
I must say, you're very
pretty, young lady.

119
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:03,515
Oh, Mr. Inoue, it's work,
W-O-R-K, and don't forget it.

120
00:06:03,549 --> 00:06:11,010
[bell ringing]

121
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:25,763
-Who do you think that
lazy monk is over there?

122
00:06:25,796 --> 00:06:28,564
-I don't know, no harm
in asking him, though.

123
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:31,397
Excuse me sir, we
were told that we'd

124
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:33,931
be able to find Mr. Nanjiro
Echizen around here.

125
00:06:33,964 --> 00:06:35,997
-C'mon, let's not bother him.

126
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,764
-And who might you two be?

127
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,564
I'm Nanjiro.

128
00:06:40,597 --> 00:06:42,397
Whoa!

129
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,897
Help me, get me down
from here, won'tcha?

130
00:06:48,564 --> 00:06:49,331
-What?

131
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:50,164
No monk reads this garbage.

132
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:17,631
-I'm Inoue from
Monthly Pro Tennis.

133
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:20,697
I'm very pleased to meet
you, Mr. Nanjiro Echizen.

134
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,597
- (GERMAN ACCENT)
Eh, I'm not Nanjiro,

135
00:07:22,631 --> 00:07:25,764
he's off travelling
somewhere very far away.

136
00:07:25,797 --> 00:07:27,697
-But you just told us you were.

137
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:30,264
-Why did his manner of
speech suddenly change?

138
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:32,997
-Geesh, reporters,
always asking questions,

139
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:34,564
mistaking me for someone else.

140
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:37,797
It's like I told you, I'm
not Nanjiro, never have been.

141
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:40,331
-But we were hoping we could do
an in-depth interview with you

142
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:41,964
today for our magazine.

143
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:43,831
-Really, what about?

144
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,897
-Hey, you just answered.

145
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:48,897
-Well, young lady, how'd you
like to have some tea with me?

146
00:07:48,931 --> 00:07:50,264
-What's his problem?

147
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:52,264
-Yeah, I ring the
bell every day.

148
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:53,064
Gong!

149
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:53,731
Gong!

150
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,397
It's very boring!

151
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:59,264
I don't get many chances to
talk with nice young ladies.

152
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:00,464
Let's go for tea.

153
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:02,064
-No thank you!

154
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:04,231
-Come on, you'll
have a great time.

155
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:05,597
-Oh, uncle!

156
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,997
I have some tea
here for all of you.

157
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:10,531
-No, of all the rotten luck.

158
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:13,331
-Uncle, I hope you're answering
their questions nicely.

159
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:13,831
-Cripes.

160
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:22,331
-Huh?

161
00:08:22,364 --> 00:08:25,031
-What crazy person would build
a court all the way out here

162
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:26,397
in the middle of nowhere?

163
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:28,064
-It could only have
been you, of course!

164
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:30,664
-The head monk of this
temple is on a treat,

165
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:32,364
my uncle is watching over it.

166
00:08:32,397 --> 00:08:35,331
But he made this tennis court
without the monk's permission.

167
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:41,964
-Must be good for something.

168
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:44,231
Hey Mr. Inoue.

169
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:45,497
-Yes?

170
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:49,397
-How'd you like to
play a game of tennis?

171
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:50,764
Well, how about it?

172
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,697
-Of course, I used to play in
school-- and not too badly,

173
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:56,797
and I still play every week
with my company's tennis club.

174
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,831
-I see.

175
00:08:57,864 --> 00:08:59,764
Let's play a game of
tennis, especially

176
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:02,264
since my fool of a son hasn't
returned from school yet

177
00:09:02,297 --> 00:09:04,264
and I have nothing to do
here except wait around

178
00:09:04,297 --> 00:09:06,097
and ring the bell for every one.

179
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:08,431
INOUE (VOICEOVER): My--
my hero, Samurai Nanjiro

180
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,764
is asking me to play
tennis with him.

181
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:12,397
-Please, wait one minute.

182
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:13,197
I'll be right back.

183
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:28,797
-I was right, Ryoma's
been practicing here.

184
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:35,564
-Can I help you?

185
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:39,497
-Oh, well, this may not
sound very important to you,

186
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:44,497
but my grandma told me I might
be able to find you here.

187
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:46,931
-So what can I do for you?

188
00:09:46,964 --> 00:09:47,697
-Nothing.

189
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:48,897
I guess it doesn't matter.

190
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:02,397
-Man, oh, man.

191
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:06,664
Echizen skipped out on
us without even helping.

192
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:08,564
-He must be out
practicing somewhere

193
00:10:08,597 --> 00:10:10,231
for his next big matchup.

194
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:12,464
Hey, you know if Ryoma
becomes a regular,

195
00:10:12,497 --> 00:10:13,997
then all of us
seventh graders are

196
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,364
going to be so proud of him.

197
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:17,997
-That's for sure, I'm happy
I joined this team just

198
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:19,697
so I can watch them
play and pick up

199
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:21,431
tennis balls on the ground.

200
00:10:21,464 --> 00:10:22,431
-What?

201
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:24,664
You guys are totally nutty.

202
00:10:24,697 --> 00:10:27,397
I'll definitely become a starter
and wear the Seigaku jacket

203
00:10:27,431 --> 00:10:28,464
someday.

204
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:31,231
-There are still 236 balls left.

205
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,231
Look it's Sadaharu.

206
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:34,797
-There are 236 balls.

207
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:37,031
Hurry and get them all.

208
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:38,597
-Oh, OK.

209
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:40,331
-Oh that Sadaharu.

210
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:43,397
I need him like I
need a broken ankle.

211
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:44,697
He really cramps my style.

212
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:50,397
-Oh.

213
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:52,164
-OK, I'm ready to play.

214
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:57,531
-Mr. Inoue, you're
embarrassing me.

215
00:10:57,564 --> 00:11:00,464
-My, he seems set to play.

216
00:11:00,497 --> 00:11:01,931
-Absolutely.

217
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:03,697
When you cover tennis
like I do, you never

218
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:06,097
know when or where you're
going to be asked to play.

219
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:08,664
That's why I always carry
my stuff around with me.

220
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:10,431
-That's what you say
but I bet you planned

221
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:13,464
on playing Nanzaburro
Echizen right from the start.

222
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:16,397
-Hey, young lady, my name
is Nanjiro and-- oops!

223
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:19,231
(GERMAN ACCENT) I mean,
I'm not Nanjiro, no not me.

224
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:22,197
-Mr. Inoue, are you sure he
was the legendary player?

225
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:23,364
He seems sort of odd.

226
00:11:23,397 --> 00:11:24,831
You know, funny in the head?

227
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:26,297
-Shiba, watch what you say.

228
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:29,897
Don't you know you're standing
right in front of his niece?

229
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:33,197
-It's OK she's really not
that far off track, you know?

230
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:35,131
-Hey, you!

231
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:40,397
You shouldn't jump to reckless
conclusions like that.

232
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:43,731
-Hey Nanako, get ready
to see a real man play.

233
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:45,631
Mr. Inoue, you look so silly.

234
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:49,064
-Good luck to both of you.

235
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:50,864
-A best of one-set match.

236
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:52,897
Service, Inoue.

237
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:56,031
Mr. Nanjiro, sir, as
a reporter, but also

238
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:59,131
speaking as a tennis player,
I have so many questions

239
00:11:59,164 --> 00:12:00,331
to ask you.

240
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:04,297
-All right, I'll be happy
to answer you Mr. Inoue.

241
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:07,397
On one condition.

242
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:10,231
All you have to do is win one
point off of me, that's all.

243
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:15,397
-All right I'll play along.

244
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:17,592
Let's get this thing started.

245
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:50,788
-Too bad Mr, Inoue.

246
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:53,655
-So, you tried to test
my backhand first.

247
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:55,955
You should have more
respect for an old man.

248
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:57,155
-No kidding.

249
00:12:57,188 --> 00:12:58,055
How's this?

250
00:12:58,088 --> 00:12:59,422
I'll try again
with more feeling.

251
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:05,455
Hey, did you know I was
one of your biggest fans.

252
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:08,855
-I never did care
much for my male fans.

253
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:12,955
-So tell me, why did you
retire all of a sudden?

254
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:13,855
-That's my secret.

255
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:18,888
-Amazing.

256
00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:26,755
-That-- that crazy old
man is really good.

257
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:28,922
-Say, my back is itchy.

258
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:30,855
INOUE (VOICEOVER): Amazing
physical reactions,

259
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:33,422
powerful muscles,
and extremely limber.

260
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:35,922
It doesn't look like he's
been retired for 20 years.

261
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:50,255
-Did you retire because you had
some sort of injury or illness?

262
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:02,988
-Shoot, thought I'd be able to
get at least one lousy point

263
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:03,488
off of him.

264
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:10,955
-I can't believe how well
your uncle still plays.

265
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:13,522
But then again, he is
a former tennis pro.

266
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:15,122
I guess it's to be expected.

267
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,955
-Look at my uncle's
feet very closely.

268
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:26,622
My uncle hasn't moved
from that position

269
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:28,455
since the match was started.

270
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:31,322
He plays like that against
Ryoma all the time.

271
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:33,688
He gives his opponent
the advantage?

272
00:14:33,722 --> 00:14:35,522
-Always.

273
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:38,655
-I didn't notice it before,
he's controlling the game

274
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:41,288
so I hit the ball right
where he's standing.

275
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:43,222
His footwork.

276
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:45,022
He keeps his left
leg planted and he

277
00:14:45,055 --> 00:14:47,588
doesn't move from
that spot at all.

278
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:48,588
-It's unbelievable.

279
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:07,455
-Ryoma, will it bother
you if I talk to you?

280
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:08,388
-Go ahead.

281
00:15:08,422 --> 00:15:09,655
Why did you start
playing tennis?

282
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:14,255
-I forget.

283
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:14,888
-Huh?

284
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:15,955
What do you mean?

285
00:15:15,988 --> 00:15:17,588
When did you sort of
woke up and realized

286
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:19,122
I was playing tennis every day.

287
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:22,055
Now I can't seem to stop
even if I wanted to.

288
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,422
-Why do you think that is?

289
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:26,288
-Well, I have the goal.

290
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:32,788
-Let's change the subject here.

291
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:35,988
Let's talk about what you have
planned for your son, Ryoma.

292
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,922
What are your intentions?

293
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:38,522
-My intentions?

294
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:46,322
Your son, he has
world class talent.

295
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:48,255
I've seen it for myself.

296
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:49,888
You're going to
train him, right?

297
00:15:49,922 --> 00:15:52,322
To become the cream of the crop?

298
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:55,388
Isn't that so?

299
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:55,955
-Back atcha.

300
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:06,055
-Mr. Inoue, you still
have a ways to go.

301
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:08,055
You've got spirit,
I'll say that much.

302
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:09,588
Still, this is
getting monotonous

303
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:12,088
so I'll give you a
little advantage.

304
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:15,822
I'll play like this from
now on, that should even us.

305
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:16,755
-Yeah?

306
00:16:16,788 --> 00:16:17,855
-Yuck.

307
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:20,122
He's winking at me,
and I can't stand him.

308
00:16:20,155 --> 00:16:21,355
-Silence!

309
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:22,922
All I'm saying is I'll play
with only one eye open,

310
00:16:22,955 --> 00:16:24,922
now take back your words.

311
00:16:24,955 --> 00:16:27,322
-Oh, is that what
he really meant.

312
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:29,855
-Come on Inoue, you've
got to score a point

313
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,588
if it's the last thing you do.

314
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:39,055
INOUE (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe it.

315
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:41,522
He's playing with
only one eye open.

316
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:43,988
He has no perspective
on the court.

317
00:16:44,022 --> 00:16:45,088
-Huh?

318
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:47,088
I don't see how he hits
the ball so easily.

319
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:50,188
-There, there, and there.

320
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:52,155
-Mr. Inoue, look at that.

321
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:54,122
He can't see.

322
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:55,688
-He's playing with
both eyes closed.

323
00:17:06,222 --> 00:17:07,188
-Ryoma playing blind.

324
00:17:07,222 --> 00:17:09,122
-You know, Mr. Inoue?

325
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:09,922
I enjoy it.

326
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:17,588
Teasing my son with tennis, I
get such a wonderful kick out

327
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:18,088
of it.

328
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:27,188
Playing tennis with that cocky,
rotten boy of mine every day

329
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:31,288
is frankly 10 times--
No, 100 times more fun

330
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:32,555
than I had when I was a pro.

331
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,988
-I get it, Mr. Nanjiro.

332
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:40,188
You treat your son as
a protege, don't you.

333
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:14,241
-Placement, form, power?

334
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:16,807
Samurai Nanjiro, no mistake.

335
00:18:19,674 --> 00:18:22,841
-I think my uncle is
starting to get serious.

336
00:18:22,874 --> 00:18:24,341
-Whoops, sorry about that.

337
00:18:24,374 --> 00:18:28,074
Might have hit it
little too hard for you?

338
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,941
-That's all right,
thank you for the game.

339
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:38,441
-Hey, Ryoma.

340
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:40,107
-Hmm?

341
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:43,907
About that gold you mentioned
earlier, what is it?

342
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:46,941
I'm sorry, it's OK if you
don't want to answer me.

343
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:54,407
-There's something I want to do

344
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:55,474
-Huh?

345
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:57,807
There's someone I want
to beat in tennis.

346
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,641
-Someone to beat?

347
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:08,607
-Right now, his playing
style is a copy of my style.

348
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:09,574
-A copy?

349
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,041
-Yeah.

350
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:12,674
-There's still
something he must do

351
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:15,074
if he's ever to become
a grand champion.

352
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:16,407
-And that is?

353
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:19,174
-I'm not telling you, you
lost the game, Mr. Inoue,

354
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,374
that's tough luck.

355
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:23,674
Life's not always so easy, huh?

356
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:25,741
-Who do you think you
are chasing us like that?

357
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:26,574
It's not fair.

358
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:27,807
I'm going to write
an article that

359
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:31,174
says Nanjiro Echison
is a very rude man.

360
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:34,474
-I am not Nanjiro Echizen.

361
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,241
-Wouldn't you like to have
some tea with me, Mr. Nanjiro?

362
00:19:37,274 --> 00:19:39,007
Just the two of us.

363
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,341
-Just two of us,
drinking some tea?

364
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:43,841
-You're not fooling
any of us Mr. Nanjiro.

365
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:46,407
-No, no, no, no, no,
I am not Nanjiro now,

366
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:49,174
but you and me getting
together for a little tea.

367
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:50,374
-No way on earth!

368
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:53,674
-Geesh, it's not nice to
tease an old man like that.

369
00:20:04,274 --> 00:20:05,107
-This looks good.

370
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,074
I have the data I need.

371
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:14,841
Now, I'll just
analyze his moves.

372
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:20,625
Ryoma Echizen's
chances of winning: 0%

373
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:59,279
-My name is Saraharu
Inue, the ninth grader.

374
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:01,279
I'm going to play Echizen next.

375
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:03,812
For a newbie, he's
been playing great.

376
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:07,412
No doubt he's quite
impressive for a rookie.

377
00:21:07,445 --> 00:21:09,212
But I've done my
research on him,

378
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:11,679
and based on my
infallible data, there's

379
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:14,445
no way Echizen will
be able to beat me.

380
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:16,679
Sorry, but I'm going
to become a regular

381
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:19,445
and no one's going to stop me.

382
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,512
Next on The Prince of
Tennis, The Two Ryomas.

383
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:24,045
Echizen's got a secret.

384
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,012
Want to know what it is?
