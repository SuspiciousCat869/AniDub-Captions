[birds chirping]

2
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,590
-Ah.

3
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:22,223
Looks like it's 9:56.

4
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:25,190
Seigaku signs in a 10:00.

5
00:00:25,223 --> 00:00:26,656
[sigh]

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,623
[scream]

00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:32,023
[theme music]

00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:51,506
[grunt]

9
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,506
-Yeah!

10
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,006
-All right!

11
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,540
-Woo-hoo!

12
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:54,073
-Way to go!

13
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:55,240
-What a shot!

14
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:56,573
-The line-up has been announced.

15
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:58,073
There'll be no
changes in the order.

16
00:01:58,106 --> 00:01:59,673
Number one, Yoshinaga.

17
00:01:59,706 --> 00:02:00,740
Two, Yamata.

18
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:02,306
And three, Kano.

19
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,306
-Ah, the Metros.

20
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,873
Everyone's revving to go.

21
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:08,873
I just wish we could record
this exciting atmosphere.

22
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:10,340
-Don't worry, Mr. Inoue.

23
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:11,540
Just leave it to me.

24
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:12,340
-Huh?

25
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:13,406
-Take a look at this.

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,506
It's a video camera.

27
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,206
Brand new.

28
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,573
I just bought it today.

29
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:17,640
-Oh.

30
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:18,673
Looks like you're
really going all out.

31
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:19,406
Aren't you, Shiba?

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,640
-It's got three CCDs.

33
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,006
It's a great camera.

34
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,973
I'll be able to record the faces
of Ryoma and everyone else.

35
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:26,073
-Listen, Shiba.

36
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:28,373
You do realize this is
a tennis tournament.

37
00:02:28,406 --> 00:02:30,006
There's no point
in taking faces.

38
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,940
Ah.

39
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:31,440
Hi there.

40
00:02:31,473 --> 00:02:32,806
-Huh?

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,506
-Oh.

42
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,673
Hello and good morning.

43
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:36,540
-So it's you again.

44
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,473
I'll out-cheer anybody.

45
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:38,973
Fight!

46
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:39,473
Fight!

47
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:40,573
Ryoma go!

48
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:43,006
Lovely R-Y-O!

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,873
Lovely R-Y-O!

50
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:44,573
-Please stop.

51
00:02:44,606 --> 00:02:46,306
You're embarrassing me.

52
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,473
-What are you talking about?

53
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:49,640
I couldn't be there
for district matches,

54
00:02:49,673 --> 00:02:51,540
so I have to go all out today.

55
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:52,040
Fight!

56
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:52,473
Fight!

57
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,273
Fight!

58
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,640
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

59
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:56,973
-By the way, I don't see
the Seigaku team around

60
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:58,306
here anywhere.

61
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,440
-I imagine they're probably
signing in right about now.

62
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:01,273
Let's go.

63
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,140
-Ryoma!

64
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:04,073
R-Y-O go!

65
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:05,040
Huh?

66
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:06,973
Wait for me!

67
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:07,406
Hey!

68
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,406
-Tezuka and Fuji I
know about, but now you

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,840
say it's that seventh grader
Echizen I need to worry about.

70
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:23,606
Mizuki?

71
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,973
-That's right.

72
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:26,906
You're going to be sorry if
you don't take him seriously.

73
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,240
-Hey, look over there,
Mizuki, It's Yudai.

74
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,440
MIZUKI: Haha.

75
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:35,140
Hey, Yudai.

76
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,473
What's wrong with you?

77
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:38,573
What's with that face?

78
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:40,773
Looks like you're
trembling with excitement.

79
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:43,473
-I've come this far, and
now I must defeat him.

80
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:44,706
-Hmm.

81
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,540
We're in the process of
figuring out Seigaku's order

82
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:50,473
so that we can arrange for
you to face Shusuke Fuji.

83
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,073
-Ha.

84
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:51,673
Thanks.

85
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:53,040
-Haha.

86
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:55,906
Well, whatever happens, there's
no way those guys at Seigaku

87
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,206
will ever be able to beat
the St. Rudolph Academy team.

88
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,873
-He's late.

89
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:07,006
What could be keeping Ryoma?

90
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,540
-If all eight of us don't
sign in by 10 o'clock,

91
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:11,440
we'll be disqualified.

92
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:13,606
-But that would be terrible.

93
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,506
-We're in trouble.

94
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,606
What about Oishi?

95
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,573
Was he be able to get
in touch with Echizen?

96
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:19,373
-If he has, we haven't
heard from him.

97
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:21,406
I mean, out of all
the days, why did he

98
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,706
have to pick today to be late?

99
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,206
BOTH: Yeah.

100
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,040
I know.

101
00:04:24,073 --> 00:04:25,173
-Hey, what's going on here?

102
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:25,840
-Huh?

103
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:27,206
-A strategy meeting?

104
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,440
If you don't hurry up and sign
in, you'll be disqualified.

105
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:31,073
-Oh, Mr. Inoue.

106
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:33,240
You see, Ryoma isn't here yet.

107
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,473
[gasps]

108
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:35,006
-Hmm.

109
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,940
-Hmm.

110
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:37,840
-Isn't that just
like Ryoma, to be

111
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:39,473
late on the day
of a competition.

112
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:41,373
He's got nerves of steel.

113
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,140
[laughs]

114
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:43,140
-Tomoka, stop it.

115
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:44,973
This is no laughing matter.

116
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:45,840
-Hey!

117
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:46,840
It's me.

118
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:49,906
I got word from Echizen.

119
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,740
He said he was helping a
woman who was having a baby.

120
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:54,540
He's been at the
hospital all morning.

121
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:59,440
[gasps]

122
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:00,506
-Sounds like a line.

123
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,473
[gasps]

124
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:02,173
-He's lying.

125
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:03,540
No doubt about it.

126
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:05,073
-Well, if he's on
his way here, he

127
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:06,840
should make it in time, then.

128
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,706
I'll save the lecture for later.

129
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,306
Anyway, we can't wait for
him before we sign in.

130
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:15,806
[gasps]

131
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:19,806
-Huh?

132
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,640
Oh.

133
00:05:21,673 --> 00:05:23,906
-Kaidoh, lend him your jersey.

134
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,106
-Ahh!

135
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,240
-Say, who's Osawa
Intermediate playing against?

136
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:30,073
-Ah.

137
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:31,473
Who was it now?

138
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:33,506
-Neither their team or
their supporters are here.

139
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,873
-Haha.

140
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:37,106
They probably got scared when
they heard our name called.

141
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,106
-Who got scared?

142
00:05:43,173 --> 00:05:44,106
-Tachibana.

143
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,540
Sorry that we're late.

144
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:48,673
-Number 128, Seigaku.

145
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:52,273
Eight members to
sign in, please.

146
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:53,706
-Let me review this.

147
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,473
My first round, your team
will play all five matches.

148
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:58,706
And whoever wins three
matches is the winner.

149
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,040
-Yes, sir.

150
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:02,573
-The top five schools will
qualify for the Konto matches.

151
00:06:02,606 --> 00:06:06,840
The top four will
win automatic entry.

152
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:09,206
The four schools that
lose in the quarter finals

153
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,240
will compete in a consolation
round for the fifth spot.

154
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:13,573
Do you understand?

155
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,073
-Yes, sir.

156
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:14,806
We do.

157
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,606
-All right, then.

158
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,540
Oh, I see you have a seventh
grader on your team, too.

159
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:20,040
-Yikes.

160
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:29,173
-Is anything wrong?

161
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:30,240
-You-- ha.

162
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:31,740
You've got a ways to go.

163
00:06:31,773 --> 00:06:32,240
Haha.

164
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,473
-Haha.

165
00:06:35,506 --> 00:06:36,540
How promising.

166
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:37,773
Well, good luck, then.

167
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:39,673
[laughs]

168
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:40,640
[collective sigh]

169
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:46,640
-You must be pretty
confident to be so late.

170
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:47,306
-Huh?

171
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,606
-Echizen of Seigaku.

172
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,040
-Don't think I know you.

173
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:52,740
-Hmm.

174
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:53,873
You're really something.

175
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:57,040
Seventh grade and
already a regular.

176
00:06:57,073 --> 00:07:01,440
You're hitting with your left
today, aren't you, Echizen?

177
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:02,806
-You're in your uniform.

178
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,206
Going home already?

179
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,306
You've got a ways to go.

180
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,106
-Hmm.

181
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,640
How cocky.

182
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:10,640
But that stubbornness
will make it easier

183
00:07:10,673 --> 00:07:13,840
for me to manipulate the
match when the time comes.

184
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:15,040
Ha.

185
00:07:15,073 --> 00:07:16,040
-Oh no.

186
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:17,373
I wonder what's
really keeping Ryoma.

187
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:18,340
[laughing]

188
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:20,906
-Well, how this?

189
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,106
Do I look good?

190
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,006
So I've finally become a
regular on the Seigaku team.

191
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,906
I mean, of course,
with my abilities,

192
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,240
I'll be able to become
one for real pretty soon.

193
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:31,806
-There you go
again mouthing off.

194
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,706
You're lucky we
weren't found out.

195
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,206
-But I gotta admit,
I'm a little jealous

196
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,673
of the regular's team jersey.

197
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:38,473
-Yeah.

198
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:39,873
Well, it belongs to Kaidoh.

199
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:41,506
So it's a little big for me.

200
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,873
Huh?

201
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:44,473
-They got the regulars.

202
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,306
-Wowee.

203
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,073
They must be really very strong.

204
00:07:47,106 --> 00:07:48,773
[laughs]

205
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:51,073
-Look at that guy over there.

206
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:51,740
[grunt]

207
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:53,073
-What an awful serve.

208
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:56,040
It's nothing compared to
my incomparable serve.

209
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:57,440
-Hey, kid.

210
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:58,773
ALL: Huh?

211
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:00,806
-People say you use
a mean kick serve.

212
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,706
-Well, ah, that's right.

213
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,340
-Well, I say you're
nothing but a liar.

214
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:06,740
And if there's one thing
I hate, it's liars.

215
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:07,306
-But wait.

216
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,240
I'm not lying.

217
00:08:08,273 --> 00:08:09,340
-Ha.

218
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,206
Then how about we
play a game together?

219
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,406
-Uh.

220
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,140
-There's an open practice
court right over here.

221
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:15,606
Come on.

222
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,073
ALL: Ugh.

223
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:18,773
[gasps]

224
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:24,240
-Shiba, don't just
take Seigaku's pics.

225
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:25,673
You have to cover every school.

226
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:26,173
-OK.

227
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,306
OK.

228
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,306
-Oh.

229
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,540
Here comes last
year's winning school.

230
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:30,340
-Huh?

231
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:31,906
-It's Hyotei Academy.

232
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,373
Seigaku lost to them in
the finals last year.

233
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:36,073
-Hmph.

234
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:37,140
So they're the enemy.

235
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:39,106
Maybe I oughtta
beat them up first.

236
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,773
-Now now.

237
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:41,340
-Well, hello there.

238
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:42,473
-Hey, Atobe.

239
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:43,773
So how is everything?

240
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:47,240
-I don't think we'll be
losing no matter who we play.

241
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:48,340
Right, Kabaji?

242
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:49,440
-Yeah.

243
00:08:49,473 --> 00:08:51,806
-That's some confidence,
but the Seigaku team

244
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,706
is much stronger than last year.

245
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,806
-Yes, but we'll nail them down.

246
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,173
Just wait and see
for yourselves.

247
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:01,806
-What's with him?

248
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,806
He's so full of himself.

249
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,740
-The confidence of
a champion, I guess.

250
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:09,806
[grunts and groans]

251
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,306
-Don't take it easy just
because it's the first round.

252
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,506
ALL: Yes, ma'am.

253
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,906
-It's Yamabuki.

254
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,006
-Hmm?

255
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,773
-They'll probably climb
the ranks as well.

256
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,006
-So, Banji, you came after all.

257
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,473
-Something wrong?

258
00:09:27,506 --> 00:09:28,706
-No.

259
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,573
I just wish Ryoma'd
get here soon.

260
00:09:37,406 --> 00:09:39,906
-This isn't good.

261
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,773
-All because Ryoma is so late.

262
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:44,873
-It's really Horio's fault
for getting so carried away.

263
00:09:44,906 --> 00:09:45,906
-What should we do?

264
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,706
-What's the matter?

265
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,206
Hit a kick already, will ya?

266
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,306
-Uh.

267
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,940
This is the end for me.

268
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:53,840
[gasp]

269
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:54,340
-Oh!

270
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:56,006
Echizen!

271
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,240
ALL: Huh?

272
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:58,440
-Huh?

273
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:02,973
Seigaku regular Echizen,
hurry up and hit the ball!

274
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:03,606
-Hmm.

275
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,106
-(NERVOUSLY) Haha.

276
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,706
Yes, sir.

277
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,906
Right away.

278
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,040
-You're late.

279
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,540
Hurry on over here and
take my place, will you?

280
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:10,973
I got stuck having
to play this--

281
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:13,940
-Hang in there, Echizen.

282
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:16,340
-Hey, Echizen!

283
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:16,973
Wait!

284
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:18,940
Don't go, please!

285
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:20,106
-You're Echizen, aren't you?

286
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,606
[crying]

287
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,373
-Oh well.

288
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,240
I guess it can't be helped.

289
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:27,340
I think one week's worth
of juice should do it.

290
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:28,340
-Huh?

291
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:30,273
Make that three
days' worth, Echizen.

292
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:32,473
After all, this is all
your fault for being late.

293
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,973
-A month's worth
ought to be enough.

294
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:34,373
-Oh.

295
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:34,740
Oh.

296
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:35,240
Oh.

297
00:10:35,273 --> 00:10:36,573
Oh.

298
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:37,940
SAKUNO: You can't
do that, Ryoma.

299
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:39,106
-Huh?

300
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,206
-After all, you were
the one who was so late.

301
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,573
So please help Horio now.

302
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:43,840
[gasps]

303
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:46,906
-Hmm.

304
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,506
Sure.

305
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,306
-Hey, dummy.

306
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,673
What are you stalling for?

307
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:51,906
BOTH: Hold your horses!

308
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,306
-Huh?

309
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,340
-And now a slight change.

310
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:59,906
Instead of Echizen, I, second
year tennis player Horio,

311
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,573
will now serve.

312
00:11:02,606 --> 00:11:04,073
[scream]

313
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,473
[grunts]

314
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,406
-Oh, Echizen.

315
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,206
You're late.

316
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,606
What were you doing?

317
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,506
-I was just getting warmed up.

318
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,073
-I can't believe it.

319
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:29,040
That kid hit a kick
serve right in my eye.

320
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:32,140
Seigaku has a bunch of
those kids on their team.

321
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:33,540
Oh!

322
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:36,073
-What do you mean you were
just getting warmed up?

323
00:11:36,106 --> 00:11:38,406
When we get back,
you're doing 40 laps.

324
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,240
-Easy on the head, Momo.

325
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:42,106
-Save the lecture for later.

326
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,373
Get ready for the matches.

327
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:44,173
-OK.

328
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:45,006
-Got for it Ryoma.

329
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,173
We're aiming for straight wins.

330
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,206
You can do it!

331
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,940
-I'm grateful he
saved my neck, but I

332
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:55,240
was wondering why he was
sliding around so much.

333
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:57,906
He dirtied my jersey on purpose.

334
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,940
What am I going to do?

335
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:01,973
I borrowed it from Kaidoh.

336
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:04,840
[grunts]

337
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,173
[breathing heavily]

338
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:16,006
-Yeah!

339
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Ryoma!

340
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:18,506
You're wonderful, Ryoma!

341
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,473
Come on!

342
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:20,606
Go get 'em!

343
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,106
-Hmm.

344
00:12:24,873 --> 00:12:28,973
If I'm not mistaken,
he's from St. Rudolph's.

345
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:31,873
ANNOUNCER: Game and match
to Echizen, Seigaku.

346
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:32,806
-Oh.

347
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,340
Has Ryoma's match ended already?

348
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:37,073
-It was a perfect game.

349
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:38,406
-Darn it.

350
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,206
And I just brought my new
video camera for the occasion.

351
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,306
-We're just in time.

352
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,406
You better do a
good job now, Shiba.

353
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,973
You never seen it
before, have you?

354
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:45,606
-Huh?

355
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,673
Never seen what?

356
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:47,773
-All right!

357
00:12:47,806 --> 00:12:49,806
Now we get to see our
first formal match.

358
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,373
-Yeah.

359
00:12:50,406 --> 00:12:51,440
That's right.

360
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:53,240
-I'm getting very excited.

361
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,640
-What's this all about?

362
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:58,140
-The last Seigaku player
and number one singles

363
00:12:58,173 --> 00:12:58,973
is Kunimitsu Tezuka.

364
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,610
-Where are these guys from, man?

365
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:16,610
These guys look cool.

366
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:20,043
[crowd chatter]

367
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:26,510
ANNOUNCER: One set match.

368
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:28,110
Seigaku's Tezuka to serve.

369
00:13:35,243 --> 00:13:35,843
-Shoot.

370
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:37,043
I'll take him on.

371
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:38,810
He may be a top
player nationally,

372
00:13:38,843 --> 00:13:40,743
but he's just in
junior high like me.

373
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:47,543
Uh.

374
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,177
-That was amazing.

375
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,943
-His first serve was an ace.

376
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:00,943
-And what fantastic speed.

377
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:03,043
15-love.

378
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,177
-He's so good.

379
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,843
-That's why he's number
one singles at Seigaku.

380
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:08,177
-No way.

381
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,143
He accurately placed his serve
in this tiny service box.

382
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:15,977
-Yes.

383
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:16,877
Great serves!

384
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,577
-Wow.

385
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,710
What speed and control.

386
00:14:18,743 --> 00:14:19,743
He's amazing.

387
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:21,610
-And it's pretty clear why.

388
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:23,410
It looks like he's
giving his flat serves

389
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:25,143
a bit of a slice spin.

390
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:27,910
Usually, if you can set a
ball in the right corner

391
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:31,110
after serving in the left,
it's impossible to get it.

392
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:32,143
-Wowee!

393
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:33,710
He hasn't allowed
his opponent a shot.

394
00:14:33,743 --> 00:14:36,677
-So this is Captain
Tezuka's true ability.

395
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,777
-Not by a long shot.

396
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,943
BOTH: Huh?

397
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:41,477
-The captain's ability
is much more than this.

398
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,843
So far he's only just
getting warmed up out there.

399
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:47,743
-There aren't many
opponents Tezuka

400
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:49,377
would use his full energies on.

401
00:14:56,377 --> 00:14:57,310
-OK.

402
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:58,943
I won't let my guard down.

403
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:04,510
-That's Seigaku, all right.

404
00:15:04,543 --> 00:15:06,377
They've won every set 6-love.

405
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,310
-Seigaku?

406
00:15:07,343 --> 00:15:07,943
Oh, man.

407
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:09,343
We play them next.

408
00:15:09,377 --> 00:15:12,343
I guess what Kuki of Kakinoki
said about Tezuka being injured

409
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:14,410
wasn't true.

410
00:15:14,443 --> 00:15:15,543
-Yeah.

411
00:15:15,577 --> 00:15:17,777
The Seigaku team this
year has no weaknesses.

412
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,343
And if they do, I sure
wish someone would tell me.

413
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,077
Ah, man.

414
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,910
There's no way we can win.

415
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:25,577
-Hey, don't you have any
confidence at all, stupid?

416
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,310
-Excuse me.

417
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,643
Sorry to interrupt you.

418
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,710
You're from Akiyama
3, aren't you?

419
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:32,110
Can you tell me
who's the captain?

420
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,010
-So who's Seigaku playing next?

421
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:40,343
-Akiyama 3.

422
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:40,877
-Oh.

423
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,043
Poor things.

424
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:45,643
Akiyama 3 doesn't stand
a chance against them.

425
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,577
[laugh]

426
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,177
-I wonder.

427
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:54,843
[gasp]

428
00:15:54,877 --> 00:15:55,810
ANNOUNCER: 15-all.

429
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:56,677
[gasp]

430
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,710
[grunt]

431
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,843
[grunt]

432
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:07,810
[laugh]

433
00:16:13,377 --> 00:16:14,310
[grunt]

434
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:22,710
-Fuji, Kawamura, you won 6-love.

435
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:25,043
But your match was
long, was it not?

436
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:25,743
-Yeah.

437
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,243
It wasn't all that easy.

438
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,243
-They kept poking at
my vulnerable spots.

439
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:30,743
-Hmm.

440
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,543
[grunt]

441
00:16:40,577 --> 00:16:41,543
[grunt]

442
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:48,443
ANNOUNCER: Game and
match to Seigaku.

443
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:49,243
[laugh]

444
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:52,543
ANNOUNCER: Six games to one.

445
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:53,210
-We won.

446
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:53,777
We won!

447
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,543
-It's so hot.

448
00:16:54,577 --> 00:16:55,777
I need something to drink.

449
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,343
-Good job!

450
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:57,277
We're 2 and 0.

451
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,077
-Just leave it to
the Golden Pair.

452
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,377
-But you two seem to be
having a lot of trouble.

453
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,510
I noticed several mistakes.

454
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:03,877
-They were doing
a lot of stuff I

455
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,577
don't like to see
on a tennis court.

456
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:06,143
-Yeah.

457
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:07,177
They sure were.

458
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,143
-Again, they picked
at our weak spots

459
00:17:09,177 --> 00:17:10,910
trying to get us where
we're vulnerable.

460
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:13,843
-That team came up the ranks
back in the district matches.

461
00:17:13,877 --> 00:17:15,743
I guess they must have
done a lot of research.

462
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,377
-Boy, it sure is hot today.

463
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,443
-OK, little guy.

464
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:28,377
It's your turn.

465
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:28,877
-All right.

466
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:33,677
ANNOUNCER: One set match.

467
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,243
Seigaku's Echizen to serve.

468
00:17:37,277 --> 00:17:38,577
-Huh?

469
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,077
-Have you been
collecting any good data?

470
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,877
-Yes, I have, Inui.

471
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,210
-If I'm not mistaken,
you're going the new manager

472
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:45,943
at St. Rudolph.

473
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:46,843
Are you not?

474
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:49,043
-No, you're not mistaken, Inui.

475
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:50,810
You've been marking
me all this time.

476
00:17:50,843 --> 00:17:52,843
Nothing seems to escape you.

477
00:17:52,877 --> 00:17:53,677
-Hmm.

478
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,443
-Well, my name's Mizuki.

479
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:58,543
And I must say it's an honor
that you know about me already.

480
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,077
-Instead of spying,
don't you need

481
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,377
to go and watch your
own teammates play?

482
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,510
-Hmm.

483
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:05,477
They'll probably win without me.

484
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,010
Number two, double 6-love.

485
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:08,643
Number one, double 6-2.

486
00:18:08,677 --> 00:18:10,743
Number three single, 6-2.

487
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:12,010
-Amazing.

488
00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:14,243
You can pinpoint your
predictions on your data alone?

489
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:15,177
-Ha.

490
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,543
Hearing you say
that goes a long way

491
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:18,577
to building my self-confidence.

492
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,843
-Depending on how
you use it, your data

493
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:24,110
can have a very big
impact-- naturally.

494
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:25,777
-Naturally?

495
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,877
-There are times
when such information

496
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,610
can be used as a weapon.

497
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:30,810
-What are you talking about?

498
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,610
-Hurry.

499
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:36,110
-OK.

500
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,810
-You used Akiyama 3
as your attack dog.

501
00:18:45,043 --> 00:18:47,510
Before the match,
you probably taught

502
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,110
them the Seigaku
players' weak points.

503
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,843
You did this so that they
would know what to look for.

504
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:57,277
Although we won the match,
we had a tougher time.

505
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,010
We were almost outwitted.

506
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:01,743
If it hadn't been for all the
data you collected and shared

507
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,710
about how our players
would overcome attacks

508
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,143
on their weak
points, we would have

509
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,743
had a much easier
time beating them.

510
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:08,510
Isn't that right, Mizuki?

511
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:10,177
-That's so unlike you, Inui.

512
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,043
Thanks to me, Akiyama was
able to play against Seigaku

513
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:15,843
on a much more even field.

514
00:19:15,877 --> 00:19:18,610
Don't you think
they're satisfied?

515
00:19:18,643 --> 00:19:21,043
[grunt]

516
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,410
ANNOUNCER: Six games to love.

517
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:24,743
Game and match to
Seigaku's Echizen.

518
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:29,577
[cheering]

519
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:34,277
-We'll use anything we
can in order to win.

520
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,943
I'm really looking
forward to playing you.

521
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:37,643
So long.

522
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,910
-What's wrong, Inui?

523
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:58,677
-Tezuka, we need to look out
for St. Rudolph's players.

524
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,243
-Hmm.

525
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:03,343
-What are you trying to say?

526
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:04,877
-They'll stop at nothing to win.

527
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:20,510
[evil laugh]

528
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:56,970
-Yo.

529
00:20:57,003 --> 00:20:58,103
Sorry to keep you waiting.

530
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:00,637
This is Momo, everyone's idol.

531
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,170
By the way, the Metropolitans
are really revving up.

532
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:03,837
Aren't they?

533
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,337
Is it my turn soon?

534
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,970
And, uh, hey old lay,
what's with this order?

535
00:21:09,003 --> 00:21:11,137
I'm playing doubles
again and-- oh no.

536
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,237
Not with this crazy guy.

537
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,570
Next on the "Prince of
Tennis," Momo and Viper.

538
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:20,870
I have no choice but to
do it, no choice at all.
