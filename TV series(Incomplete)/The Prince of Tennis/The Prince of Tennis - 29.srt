1
00:00:14,856 --> 00:00:17,790
-Just do it, Kamio.

2
00:00:17,823 --> 00:00:18,290
-Wow!

3
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:23,856
-You guys can't move at all.

4
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:28,723
ANNOUNCER (ON PA
SYSTEM): 40 love.

5
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:30,623
-[panting]

6
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:34,190
-It seems like Kamio has gotten
even faster than he was before.

7
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:35,290
-More stamina, too.

8
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:37,656
The Osawa players are
gasping for breath,

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,156
but Kamio, who's been running
twice as hard, is fine.

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,756
-Don't step up your rhythm.

11
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,856
Hey, Shinji, why not show
them your kick serve?

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,056
-Isn't it a little humid today?

13
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,656
It's too hot.

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,990
Let's just finish this up.

15
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,256
-Ugh!

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,223
-That's it!

17
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:00,856
Ibu's famous kick serve!

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,523
ANNOUNCER (ON PA
SYSTEM): Game and match

19
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:04,690
to Fudomine, six games to love.

20
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:07,856
[cheering]

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,223
-I don't believe it.

22
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:10,256
It came out of nowhere.

23
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:16,356
-The main players
have been cast.

24
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,256
[theme music]

25
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:31,293
-Thank you very much.

26
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:34,160
-I can't believe we lost to
an unknown school like yours.

27
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:35,193
-Oh, well.

28
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:37,360
I guess I'll play
Hiote Academy next.

29
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:38,826
That means they're sure to lose.

30
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,726
-[laughing]

31
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,593
-Is that all you have to say?

32
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:43,926
-Whoa!

33
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,793
-We make it a point to beat
schools that are that good.

34
00:02:46,826 --> 00:02:47,993
-Huh?

35
00:02:48,026 --> 00:02:48,660
-Let's go.

36
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:49,726
-Tachibana?

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,660
So, can we finally
get down to business?

38
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:53,493
-Fudomine won!

39
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:55,393
-They're in the quarter finals!

40
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,293
-Really?

41
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:57,226
-Huh.

42
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,526
Funa Fide junior high.

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,060
They're a good team.

44
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:02,693
It's too bad the girls are
playing at the other courts.

45
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:04,193
Aw, man.

46
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,793
That's no fun.

47
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:09,593
And my horoscope said this
was a perfect day for love.

48
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:10,226
Huh?

49
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:10,793
Seigaku?

50
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:11,260
Huh?

51
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:23,126
Hey, thanks a lot for the other
day for leaving me behind.

52
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,126
-Oh, my.

53
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,126
It must be him.

54
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,193
-Well now, you must be
that rookie from Seigaku.

55
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:46,293
-You're Sengoku, who was picked
as an all-star this year.

56
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,326
Uh, it's an honor to meet you.

57
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,093
Uh, Echizen, do you know him?

58
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:51,860
-No, don't know the guy.

59
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:52,860
-Hey, come on.

60
00:03:52,893 --> 00:03:54,760
-He doesn't remember!

61
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:56,526
-So like Ryoma.

62
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,293
-I only got into the all-stars
because your captain Tezuka

63
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:01,726
refused a spot and they
needed me to fill it.

64
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,626
But man, that food fight team?

65
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,726
They're a tough,
dark horse bunch.

66
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,360
-It's Fudomine, not food fight.

67
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:11,793
-So you're really good, huh?

68
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:12,626
-Huh?

69
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,793
I guess so.

70
00:04:13,826 --> 00:04:16,160
-So, looks like Seigaku's here.

71
00:04:16,193 --> 00:04:17,160
-Hey there, Kamio.

72
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:18,126
-Oh, how cool.

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,726
It ks like the
rivals are together.

74
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,993
-They're all so cute!

75
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:22,560
-T-Tamoka!

76
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:24,226
-So Hyotei's up next?

77
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,360
-Yeah.

78
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:27,660
I'm going to pay Atobe
back for the other day.

79
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:33,060
-Just don't let it backfire.

80
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:33,993
-Hey, Echizen.

81
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:35,660
So how's your equipment?

82
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:36,226
-It's good.

83
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,960
-I'll bet it is.

84
00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:40,893
I envy you, because I
really wanted it badly,

85
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:43,026
but there was only one left.

86
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,093
-Guess we'll see
you in the finals.

87
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:48,160
Looks like it's time for me
to even the score with Viper.

88
00:04:48,193 --> 00:04:49,326
-Be our guest.

89
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,426
Even if that idiot
tanks, we're still

90
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,593
going to kick butt
and win the day.

91
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,460
-Huh?

92
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:56,626
-[hiss]

93
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,860
Hey, moron.

94
00:04:57,893 --> 00:04:59,360
Who'd you say was gonna lose?

95
00:04:59,393 --> 00:05:00,293
-It's Kaidoh.

96
00:05:00,326 --> 00:05:01,326
-What's that?

97
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,760
Which idiot did you
say is gonna tank?

98
00:05:02,793 --> 00:05:03,893
-You're not listening.

99
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:06,860
That idiot's standing
right in front of me.

100
00:05:06,893 --> 00:05:08,293
-[gasp]

101
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:09,493
-You shut up!

102
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:11,426
-Well, well, Viper.

103
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,393
I'm glad we finally met up.

104
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:16,193
Listen, next time we
play, I'm gonna win.

105
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:17,293
Hey, you!

106
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:20,460
Listen to me!

107
00:05:20,493 --> 00:05:21,793
Hey, I said listen!

108
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:23,026
-Kamio, Shinji.

109
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,626
-Yeah?

110
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,226
-Come on.

111
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,826
-OK, captain.

112
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,960
-Tachibana?

113
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,060
-Hey, Echizen.

114
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:32,426
Will you let Tezuka
know that this is war?

115
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,626
We'll see you in
the finals, then.

116
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
-Hey, you two.

117
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:37,860
Did you hear that?

118
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:39,560
-[growling]

119
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:40,626
-Those two players.

120
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,160
They're just not listening.

121
00:05:45,993 --> 00:05:47,826
-That Tachibana.

122
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,660
Who is he?

123
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,160
-Don't these two guys get along?

124
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:54,426
-Don't think so.

125
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,260
-Uh-oh.

126
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:56,393
I can't believe it.

127
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:57,893
Looks like we've
got more rivalry.

128
00:05:57,926 --> 00:05:58,393
-Huh?

129
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:03,860
Rivalry?

130
00:06:03,893 --> 00:06:04,360
-Hyotei!

131
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:04,860
Hyotei!

132
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:05,893
Hyotei!

133
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:06,793
Hyotei!

134
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:08,160
Hyotei!

135
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:10,393
-That's sure not nice,
intimidating players like that.

136
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:12,060
-I'm sure there
are a lot of teams

137
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:13,626
that would be bugged
by that chanting,

138
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,826
but Hyotei's players
are too good.

139
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,526
-Hyotei!

140
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,126
Hyotei!

141
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,093
Hyotei!

142
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:18,593
Hyotei!

143
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:27,926
[cheering]

144
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,126
-Wow, what a mess.

145
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,060
Shishido mouthed off about
winning in 20 minutes,

146
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:33,393
and now look at him.

147
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:33,960
-Yeah.

148
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,760
-Shut up, Atobe.

149
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:37,960
-I'll finish in 15 minutes.

150
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:39,093
Let's go, Kabachi.

151
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:41,126
-Yeah.

152
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,626
-Hm.

153
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:53,960
-So, looks like
the usual teams are

154
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:56,126
advancing just like
we expected them to.

155
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,626
[cheering]

156
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,160
-Just one time, I'd
really like to battle

157
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:04,660
that kind of cheering, you know?

158
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:05,326
-Hyotei!

159
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,560
Hyotei!

160
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,593
Hyotei!

161
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:08,360
Hyotei!

162
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:08,860
Hyotei!

163
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:15,193
-Seigaku Team, come here!

164
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:15,693
-Coach!

165
00:07:21,593 --> 00:07:22,760
-All right, guys.

166
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:25,026
Here's the lineup against
the St. Rudolph's team.

167
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,260
You have to put it
all on the line today.

168
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:30,593
You win this and we're all
going to the Kanto Tournament.

169
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:32,226
Number one singles, Tezuka.

170
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,660
Number two singles, Fuji.

171
00:07:33,693 --> 00:07:35,560
Number three singles, Echizen.

172
00:07:35,593 --> 00:07:37,860
Number one doubles,
Kikumaru and Oishi.

173
00:07:37,893 --> 00:07:40,326
Number two doubles,
Momoshiro and Kaidoh.

174
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,093
-Doubles?

175
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:43,860
-Doubles?

176
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:44,460
-With him?

177
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:57,226
-158, 159, 160.

178
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,060
-I won't lose to him!

179
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:01,526
-I won't lose to him!

180
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,260
-St. Rudolph's been recruiting.

181
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:05,893
They've picked up some
really excellent players.

182
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:08,426
We have to keep our
eyes on their captain.

183
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,726
His name's Akazawa,
and he's great.

184
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,960
He's a veteran who's even
beat our regulars last year.

185
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:18,226
And then we have Shusuke's
dangerous kid brother Yuta.

186
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,893
He's been practicing
against left handed players,

187
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:23,993
and he's gaining a reputation
as a leftie killer.

188
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:27,426
I hear he's out to beat Shusuke.

189
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,260
-Well, I'm not left
handed, you know?

190
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:30,693
So he won't beat me.

191
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:31,493
-True.

192
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:33,226
He'll probably play Tezuka.

193
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,293
Their new manager appears
to be making the calls.

194
00:08:36,326 --> 00:08:37,393
-Manager?

195
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:40,260
-He's a recruit, and
he's one of the best.

196
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:43,626
Their recruits only join
practice once or twice a week.

197
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,960
The rest of the time,
they go to lessons.

198
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,760
-They sure are going all out.

199
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,226
-They're practically
professionals.

200
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,426
-Yeah.

201
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,960
And I thought St. Rudolph
seemed strong already.

202
00:08:51,993 --> 00:08:53,326
-Well, sure, Kojiro.

203
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,860
But do you really
see the possibility

204
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:56,960
of our regulars
losing to anybody?

205
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:58,026
-Don't mess up.

206
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,593
-Huh?

207
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:01,326
-What'd you say?

208
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,726
-Hmph.

209
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,426
-Seigaku has a problem.

210
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,393
-Number three singles.

211
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:09,060
Number three singles.

212
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:10,393
Number three singles.

213
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,093
-Right on target.

214
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:22,193
Sorry, Yuta.

215
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:24,493
Looks like they're avoiding you.

216
00:09:24,526 --> 00:09:28,226
I was sure Shusuke Fuji would
be playing number three.

217
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,493
-Huh?

218
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:32,826
-It seems we were outsmarted
by Sadaharu Inui's data,

219
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,093
and it seems he was avoiding
a match between brothers.

220
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:37,493
-Well, it can't be helped.

221
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:38,826
-Yeah.

222
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,060
It sure would look bad if
Fuji lost to his kid brother.

223
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:44,260
-What did you just say?

224
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,393
Did you just call me
Fuji's kid brother?

225
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:49,293
Nobody can call me that
and get away with it.

226
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:51,193
-I-- I, uh-- I'm sorry.

227
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:51,760
I forgot.

228
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:52,693
That's taboo.

229
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,360
-I'm sorry about
the lineup, Yuta,

230
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,960
but it looks like
you're going to have

231
00:09:55,993 --> 00:10:00,026
to beat Ryoma Echizen
in singles today.

232
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,060
-Hmph.

233
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:02,726
-Did you hear what
I said to you, Yuta?

234
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,126
-That's fine.

235
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,926
Leave me at number
three singles.

236
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,893
But if that seventh grader
isn't as good as Shusuke Fuji,

237
00:10:08,926 --> 00:10:11,060
then I'll be mad.

238
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:13,660
I'll pound him into the ground.

239
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:14,726
-Oh, boy.

240
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,060
Our ace is pretty
hot, that's for sure.

241
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:19,226
-Just leave him alone
right now, all right?

242
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,560
Hey, Mizuki.

243
00:10:20,593 --> 00:10:23,293
The Seigaku team's not
stacking the lineup, is it?

244
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:24,526
-[chuckling]

245
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,393
-You really scare me.

246
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,293
So why play Yuta against
that seventh grader?

247
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:32,426
-Because I checked on that
seventh grader's record.

248
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,026
According to my data, he breezed
through district matches.

249
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,860
He didn't lose, but he didn't
play any lefties, either.

250
00:10:40,393 --> 00:10:42,560
-And so you brought
in left handed

251
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:46,426
Yuta, leftie killer Yuta.

252
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,260
So I guess that's why you
trained him to play Tezuka.

253
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:51,693
-[laughs] Exactly.

254
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:53,826
I'm not going to pit
him against his brother,

255
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,760
no matter how much
he wants me to.

256
00:10:55,793 --> 00:10:57,360
I just won't do it.

257
00:10:57,393 --> 00:10:59,760
And as for that singles
match against Tezuka,

258
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,093
it's nothing but a
throwaway match anyway.

259
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:04,526
But if we play Yuta
against the seventh grader,

260
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,793
we are sure to win it.

261
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:08,026
There's no doubt about it.

262
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,360
-So you set this whole
thing up, then, huh?

263
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:13,526
I would not want you on
their side, that's for sure.

264
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,726
-Hmph.

265
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,193
If Tezuka wins in the
number one singles match,

266
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:18,893
we'll be in bad shape.

267
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:21,793
But if we can defeat the Golden
Pair, Oishi and Kikumaru,

268
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:25,026
we won't have to come
up against Tezuka.

269
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,760
That is the key.

270
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:31,960
--[laughs] So that must be why
you had me playing number one

271
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:32,860
doubles, huh?

272
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:33,826
-Yeah.

273
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,460
It takes just a little
bit of research,

274
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:37,660
and you can tell an awful lot.

275
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:41,026
We'll win this match with
one singles and two doubles.

276
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,960
And as added
insurance, I will play.

277
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:46,660
I've entered myself to play
in the number two singles

278
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:48,760
position.

279
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:50,760
-I can't believe they're
making Echizen run

280
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,026
errands before a match.

281
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,760
Ryoma, can I carry that?

282
00:11:54,793 --> 00:11:55,993
-Nah.

283
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:58,026
You know, Kojiro, it's
important not to spoil him.

284
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,460
-Um.

285
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:00,260
-Hey.

286
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:02,460
Is your name Ryoma Echizen?

287
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:03,460
-Why, yes it is.

288
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:04,660
Who are you?

289
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:05,760
-Yuta Fuji.

290
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:09,060
-Hm.

291
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,102
-Yuta Fuji.

292
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,569
-Hey, then you must be--

293
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:20,669
-The guy who's gonna play Ryoma.

294
00:12:20,702 --> 00:12:22,102
-You're Fuji's little brother?

295
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:23,135
-Don't say that!

296
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:25,635
I'm myself, Yuta Fuji!

297
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:28,969
-Oh, I'm sorry!

298
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:29,402
-Huh?

299
00:12:29,435 --> 00:12:30,535
Hey, wait!

300
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:31,302
-Ryoma!

301
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:31,935
-Hm.

302
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:33,035
Nice to meet you.

303
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:33,835
-Wait for us!

304
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:34,969
-We're coming!

305
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:35,469
-Slow down!

306
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,835
-The winner makes it to the
Kanto tournament, so let's

307
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:02,169
all play hard, guys.

308
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:04,335
-You two are supposed
to be pretty tough.

309
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:05,535
This should be good.

310
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:08,535
-Let's play.

311
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:11,002
-Oh, this is so cool!

312
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:13,935
-I think they're starting with
Momoshiro and Kaidoh's doubles,

313
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:14,735
aren't they?

314
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,469
-Will they be OK?

315
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:18,169
-Oh, I think it'll be fine.

316
00:13:18,202 --> 00:13:21,369
They're both eighth graders.

317
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:24,602
--[sigh] I can't believe that
we have to play together.

318
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:26,369
-Quit griping, will you?

319
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:28,802
Poor Taka ended up
as an alternate.

320
00:13:28,835 --> 00:13:30,069
-Oh, back off.

321
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:30,569
-Ow!

322
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:31,402
-Oh!

323
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,235
-Oh!

324
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,869
-Hey, you really hurt me, Viper!

325
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:36,602
-What'd you say?

326
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:37,402
-Those two?

327
00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:38,769
-Well, there they go again.

328
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:40,302
-Let go of me, Viper.

329
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:43,769
-You wanna fight me?

330
00:13:43,802 --> 00:13:46,035
-So tell me, have they
always been like that?

331
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:47,269
-Yeah.

332
00:13:47,302 --> 00:13:49,369
The two of them have a
rivalry that goes way back.

333
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:51,335
-Inui, show him
that book of yours.

334
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:52,635
-You mean--

335
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:53,635
-What is it?

336
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:54,569
What is it?

337
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,135
Oh, look, they're so cute!

338
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,235
-Hey, let me see!

339
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:04,769
-Those two have fought
ever since the day

340
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,835
they made the team.

341
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:11,369
-Did you step on my bandanna?

342
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:12,735
-Wow, I'm sorry.

343
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,002
I guess I just didn't see
it there lying on the floor.

344
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:15,835
-Jerk!

345
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:17,435
That wasn't even a real apology!

346
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:18,235
-What?

347
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:19,402
-Apologize!

348
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:20,869
-I am apologizing!

349
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,235
-What are you two doing?

350
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:24,702
-Hey, don't you talk to me
like we're good friends!

351
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:27,202
-What about you with
your ugly snake face?

352
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:28,002
-[hiss]

353
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:28,769
-Stop it, you two!

354
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:33,569
Stop!

355
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:36,602
just cut it out!

356
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:38,902
-So do you mean that
they've been fighting ever

357
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:40,369
since the day they met?

358
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:42,369
-Even today, those
guys still don't

359
00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:44,202
seem to get along
very well at all.

360
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:45,635
-Yeah.

361
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:47,902
So what's the point of pairing
them up for doubles, anyway?

362
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:50,202
-Kaidoh, don't hold me back.

363
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:51,802
-Don't you, either.

364
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:53,069
-Wait a second.

365
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:55,435
I could have sworn there was
a match like this before.

366
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:57,502
-Huh?

367
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,235
-Hm?

368
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:01,969
-I didn't think
Kaidoh and Momoshiro

369
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:05,669
would be paired for doubles.

370
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:07,069
Hm.

371
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:09,002
I guess they wanted
to surprise us.

372
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:15,969
But it won't do you any good
to fiddle with the order.

373
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,569
I have all your personal
data in my head.

374
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:20,902
-Well now, didn't expect this.

375
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:22,402
Looks like it's an easy win.

376
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:24,969
-Mizuki says we'll
win 6-2, but there's

377
00:15:25,002 --> 00:15:27,269
no way we'll lose
two games to them.

378
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,935
ANNOUNCER (ON PA
SYSTEM): One set match.

379
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,902
Seigaku's Momoshiro to serve.

380
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:36,435
-You see that?

381
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,635
It was Momoshiro's bullet serve!

382
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:45,202
-His ball has power, but--

383
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,269
-That's good.

384
00:15:46,302 --> 00:15:47,902
Looks like Kaidoh's
already [inaudible].

385
00:15:47,935 --> 00:15:48,935
-Hey there, bandanna boy!

386
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:50,502
Your reach is too long!

387
00:15:55,002 --> 00:15:55,635
-Huh?

388
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:56,602
Move back, Atsushi!

389
00:15:56,635 --> 00:15:57,335
It's coming!

390
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:59,502
-Too late!

391
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:01,835
-Oh, it's the double smash.

392
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:03,669
-Bang!

393
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:04,469
-Oh!

394
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:05,869
-Wow, that was really great!

395
00:16:05,902 --> 00:16:07,002
-Did you see that?

396
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:09,035
He used the net player
to protect his smash.

397
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:09,569
-Yeah.

398
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:10,169
Not too bad.

399
00:16:14,102 --> 00:16:15,069
-See that?

400
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:16,635
Kaidoh poached and
Momoshiro smashed,

401
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:19,569
and they both
stayed cool as well.

402
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:20,869
-Yeah.

403
00:16:20,902 --> 00:16:22,335
To be able to do that right
when the match is starting

404
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:24,202
is totally awesome!

405
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:25,335
-Your smash is shallow.

406
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:26,835
There's no doubt
that they'll easily

407
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:28,369
be able to read it next time.

408
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:29,569
-Just shut up.

409
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:32,069
Where did you pick up such
lousy poaching, anyway?

410
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:33,569
-What did you say to me?

411
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:34,069
-You!

412
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:35,402
-Oh, man.

413
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:37,169
They're still just as hotheaded
as ever toward each other!

414
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:40,735
-Both of them still have
a long, long ways to--

415
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,302
-Don't get started!

416
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,869
-If you get in the middle
of it, it'll only get worse!

417
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:46,969
-But it looks like
it might go well!

418
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:49,335
It's like they can read
each other's moves!

419
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:50,469
-Well of course they can.

420
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:51,869
-It makes sense.

421
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:54,635
They spent an entire year
watching each other's game.

422
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:03,269
-Those two are still
practicing their swings?

423
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:04,069
-Yes.

424
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:05,869
And I've told them to stop.

425
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:09,769
-I'm not gonna lose to him!

426
00:17:09,802 --> 00:17:13,802
I am not gonna lose to him!

427
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:14,669
-It's mine!

428
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:17,635
-It's mine!

429
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:22,069
-I won't lose to him!

430
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:26,502
-I won't lose to him!

ANNOUNCER (ON PA SYSTEM): Game

[cheering]

433
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:33,835
-Aw, man, those guys don't
have too many weaknesses.

434
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:35,769
They're pretty
powerful, sure enough.

435
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:37,569
-Yeah, but something's weird.

436
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:40,369
-I don't want to play with
the likes of you anymore.

437
00:17:40,402 --> 00:17:41,802
-Well, that goes double for me.

438
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:42,802
-Oh, great.

439
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:44,502
Looks like they're
at it again, huh?

440
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:46,635
-You think they can
still play like that?

441
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,202
-Seigaku, get with it.

442
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,902
You're here to play tennis.

443
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,535
-So in order for us to
be done with this match.

444
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:55,135
-We've gotta.

445
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:57,369
-Blow St. Rudolph's
off the court.

446
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:12,535
-Man!

-2-1!

450
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:18,069
It looks like
they're amping it up!

451
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:20,002
-It looks like they'll be fine.

452
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:21,269
-It's all right.

453
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:23,235
They're playing better than
they were during practice.

454
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,202
-Well, I guess
that rivalry really

455
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:26,802
seems to add to their energy.

456
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:29,035
-Hey, maybe the three
of us could be rivals.

457
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:30,269
-Don't joke!

458
00:18:30,302 --> 00:18:32,402
I'm on a completely
different level from you two!

459
00:18:32,435 --> 00:18:33,669
-How rude!

460
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:36,535
We're gonna be way better
players than you someday!

461
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:37,202
-That's right!

462
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:37,702
-Hmph.

463
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:41,935
Hm.

464
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:46,435
-Hm!

465
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:47,369
-Yes, Mizuki, I know!

466
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:48,635
You don't have to glare at us!

467
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,569
We've got to think!

468
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,502
-Was that just luck?

469
00:18:57,535 --> 00:19:01,235
That's a shot Kaidoh
has trouble with!

470
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:03,202
-Lucky!

471
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:05,169
-Get back, Kaidoh!

472
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:06,169
Get back!

473
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:11,069
-Whoa!

474
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:16,469
Wow!

475
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,742
He spun around in midair!

476
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:22,675
-The drop shot.

477
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,608
-I hate that!

478
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:24,508
-Got it.

479
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:25,642
Sure enough.

480
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:27,408
-This guy plays it cool.

481
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:33,608
-They read the ball.

482
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:34,575
-Oh, man!

483
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:37,408
They figured us out!

484
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:41,142
-Yeah, they got it!

485
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:42,608
-It's not over.

486
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:45,708
Just as Momoshiro is good
at the vertical moves,

487
00:19:45,742 --> 00:19:48,208
Kaidoh's there to cover
the horizontal plays.

488
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,642
-All right, guess it's coming!

489
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:54,208
-Snake shot!

490
00:19:58,008 --> 00:19:58,908
-Kaidoh, no!

491
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:09,608
[laughing]

492
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:10,108

Mizuki's plan, we're

496
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,763
going to defeat that
Momoshiro Kaidoh team!

497
00:21:07,797 --> 00:21:11,397
There's no need for us
to even play this match.

We've got our strategy down pat.

all your best stuff.
