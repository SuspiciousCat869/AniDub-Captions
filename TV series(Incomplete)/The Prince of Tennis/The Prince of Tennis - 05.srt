1
00:00:07,438 --> 00:00:09,238
-He returned it.

2
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:10,404
-Not again.

3
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:12,704
Echizen fell right into
the viper's secret trap.

4
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:13,738
-Huh?

5
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:14,738
A what?

6
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:15,804
-Trap.

7
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:18,371
The viper uses the
snake shot as a trick.

8
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:20,871
What he's really up
to is-- is he's--

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:01:24,254
[theme music]

10
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,247
-Hm.

11
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,080
So that's the angle
he's gonna take.

12
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,647
You still have a ways to go.

13
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,313
-Huh?

14
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:52,647
He switched hands.

15
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,880
-Do you think that
Echizen will be

16
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:18,713
able to hit if he switches
his racket to his left hand?

17
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:19,980
It seems tough.

18
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:21,313
-Don't know, but we'll see.

19
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:23,813
-He's a natural lefty.

20
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:25,013
-Oh, hello, Coach Ryuzaki.

21
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,658
RYUZAKI: He's no
ordinary rookie.

22
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:35,580
OK, Ryoma.

23
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,747
Here's your chance.

24
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,100
-Come on, Ryoma.

25
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,432
-Oh, the snake shot?

26
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:58,599
-No, that was just a return.

27
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:06,332
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER):
This kid hits well.

28
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:07,399
Lots of spin.

29
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:08,332
Low and deep.

30
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:11,499
Just inside the baseline.

31
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:22,932
But that doesn't matter to me!

32
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:23,932
-That was the snake shot.

33
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:32,365
Echizen can barely
get to the ball.

34
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,599
-Here it goes!

35
00:03:37,765 --> 00:03:38,332
ANNOUNCER: Out.

36
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:44,432
-Echizen returned that shot.

37
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:47,465
-It didn't work.

38
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:48,432
-Awesome.

39
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:51,165
Oh, this is really,
really close.

40
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,265
Oh no.

41
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:55,565
-What a great guy.

42
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,199
-Stop.

43
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:56,999
He might hear you.

44
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:02,765
-Game to Kaidoh.

45
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,965
Game to Echizen.

46
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,065
-Hey.

47
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,832
The score's tied at 1-1!

48
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:14,399
Echizen's keeping up with
one of Seigaku's best.

49
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:15,132
Pretty impressive.

50
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:25,251
BOY: Man, it's hot today.

51
00:04:25,284 --> 00:04:27,696
Just watching the
game makes you sweat.

52
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:31,264
Hey, so, uh, who do you
think's gonna win this?

53
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:43,697
-Finish!

54
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:51,268
-Look out!

55
00:04:51,302 --> 00:04:52,102
Here comes the snake shot!

56
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:58,502
He got to it.

57
00:04:58,535 --> 00:05:00,168
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER):
His footwork's good.

58
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:01,202
He returned my best shot.

59
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:17,454
You may be really fast, but
that's why you're going down,

60
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:18,454
seventh grader.

61
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:28,720
-Ryoma's returning
every single ball.

62
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:32,754
He may have a chance after all.

63
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:34,220
-He's so good!

64
00:05:34,254 --> 00:05:35,587
-Hey, keep on shooting him.

65
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,087
-Yeah.

66
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:47,120
-His footwork is
quite remarkable.

67
00:05:47,154 --> 00:05:47,987
But still.

68
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:54,620
-He returned it.

69
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:55,754
-Not again.

70
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:58,086
Echizen fell right into
the viper's secret trap.

71
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:58,586
-Huh?

72
00:05:58,619 --> 00:05:59,086
A what?

73
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,286
-Trap.

74
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,053
The viper uses the
snake shot as a trick.

75
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,586
What he's really up
to is-- is he's--

76
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:21,899
-Ryoma's really wearing out.

77
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,199
-I got it.

78
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,299
He has to chase after
those snake shots,

79
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,166
and it's totally
dehydrating him.

80
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,466
MOMOSHIRO: You got it.

81
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:42,899
Viper's style is
to keep tormenting

82
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:46,733
his exhausted opponent.

83
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:50,833
The more balls Ryoma returns,
the more exhausted he becomes.

84
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:52,399
BOY: Ryoma can't keep this up.

85
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,533
ANNOUNCER: 40-Love.

86
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:03,333
BOY: You sure know a lot
about his game, Momoshiro.

87
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:04,033
-Huh?

88
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:06,433
-You can say that again.

89
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:07,533
-I got it.

90
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:11,299
You must have lost to
the viper that way.

91
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,666
-What?

92
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,666
Shut up, you little seventh
graders, and watch the game.

93
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,899
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER): So,
he's getting pretty close.

94
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,099
He's going down.

95
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,799
This cannot be.

96
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,466
He has to be totally drained.

97
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:45,199
His shot is so powerful.

98
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:47,166
Where is he getting this energy?

99
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,199
Weird.

100
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,499
His game is getting much better.

101
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:51,533
And even faster!

102
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,199
-Sweating just a little
bit, I see, Kaidoh.

103
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:14,633
ANNOUNCER: 40-30.

104
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:29,033
-What a great match.

105
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:47,399
-Aw.

106
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:48,633
-Hi there, uncle.

107
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,733
I'm home.

108
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:51,566
-Oh!

109
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,399
I wasn't expecting you so early.

110
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,633
You having fun in college?

111
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,999
-I'm having a great time.

112
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,166
I just now got back.

113
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,499
-Welcome home, Nanako darling.

114
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:01,333
-Hi.

115
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:03,033
It's great to see you, auntie.

116
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,099
-Dear.

117
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,033
Put that magazine away
right this minute.

118
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:16,133
NANAKO: Uncle!

119
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:16,999
I can't believe it!

120
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:18,899
You're reading trash!

121
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,666
NANJIRO: Uh, no!

122
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:20,833
Uh, no I'm not!

123
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:23,425
[meow]

124
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,866
ANNOUNCER: Game to Echizen.

125
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:45,166
What do you know?

126
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:47,266
Kaidoh's the one
who's out of gas.

127
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:48,999
Ah, he can't figure it out.

128
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:49,999
Echizen's playing him.

129
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:55,766
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER): His
shots are still the same.

130
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,533
It's not possible.

131
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:58,833
I can't be slowing down.

132
00:10:14,392 --> 00:10:17,692
ANNOUNCER: Game to Echizen.

133
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:18,758
-No way.

134
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,125
Echizen's running Kaidoh
all over the court.

135
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:22,525
-What's going on?

136
00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:26,092
I thought Kaidoh was killing him
with those snake shots of his.

137
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,958
-I've never seen
Kaidoh look so tired.

138
00:10:28,992 --> 00:10:29,925
-Huh?

139
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,358
Sakuno, why does
Kaidoh look so tired?

140
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:35,325
-I'm sure I wouldn't know.

141
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,358
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER):
I hate that shot.

142
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,358
It always goes in!

143
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:19,758
I missed it!

144
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:31,592
-Looks like the viper
really got taken for a ride.

145
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,592
-What's going on?

146
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,325
Wasn't Echizen the
one who was tired?

147
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:37,325
INUI: Kaidoh used his
snake shot to make

148
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:39,125
Echizen run after the ball.

149
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:41,125
That was his strategy
to tire his opponent.

150
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:46,458
Echizen beat him at his game.

151
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:48,725
Ryoma keeps hitting the
ball low and deep just

152
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:50,992
inside the baseline,
right at his feet.

153
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:58,525
Kaidoh has to bend his knees
and keep this body low,

154
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:01,325
so every time Ryoma
hits that shot,

155
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:05,358
Kaidoh is using up double
the energy he normally would.

156
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:09,825
ANNOUNCER: 30-Love.

157
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:12,158
-By staying consistent,
Ryoma managed

158
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,692
to tie our his opponent instead.

159
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:16,192
[sigh]

160
00:12:16,225 --> 00:12:18,692
-Ryoma is so totally cool.

161
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:20,158
Ryoma's, like, number one!

162
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:20,658
Ha ha!

163
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:21,658
He rocks!

164
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:33,425
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER): Looks like
I'm the one caught in the trap.

165
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,458
-It looks like both
players are exhausted,

166
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:38,625
but I think Echizen's got
the viper's strategy totally

167
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,558
figured out.

168
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:42,625
Kaidoh didn't realize
that he'd been caught,

169
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:45,025
so Ryoma had a huge mental edge.

170
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:47,892
I mean, I think that's where
the viper lost the game.

171
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:51,392
-He lost his head, that viper.

172
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:53,525
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER):
OK, so I'm tired.

173
00:12:53,558 --> 00:12:54,858
But he must be, too.

174
00:12:54,892 --> 00:12:56,892
If I lose to a rookie,
I'll be a laughing stock.

175
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:06,658
ANNOUNCER: Game to Echizen.

176
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:08,658
Game to Kaidoh.

177
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:11,925
BOY: Kaidoh looks like he's
still got some fight in him.

178
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,925
KACHIRO: Now that Kaidoh
knows Ryoma's strategy,

179
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,392
I wonder if he can outlast him.

180
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:38,292
-Snake shot.

181
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:41,792
Top spin rules.

182
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:44,258
That's it.

183
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:45,725
That's the answer.

184
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:57,492
-Huh?

185
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,725
-Oh-- Oh no!

186
00:14:04,758 --> 00:14:07,558
-Wow.

187
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:09,725
A snake shot.

188
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:11,558
-Snake shot?

189
00:14:11,592 --> 00:14:12,625
-Snake shot.

190
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:14,492
-Why'd he do it?

191
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:16,458
He did a snake shot also.

192
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:18,592
-Ryoma is too awesome.

193
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,825
-This is so crazy.

194
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:25,525
-Mr. Inoue.

195
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:28,625
What was it that
Echizen said before?

196
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:30,825
-He said top spin rules.

197
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:33,392
-Top spin rules?

198
00:14:33,425 --> 00:14:35,625
INOUE: He hits a huge
looping shot from low to high

199
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:39,558
to put major spin on the ball.

200
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:41,525
That's the most important part.

201
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:44,958
Many top pro players have
this shot in their arsenals.

202
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:47,292
Kaidoh's snake shot
is based on that,

203
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:51,158
but it takes a special
technique, so it's not easy.

204
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:56,025
But the rookie was able to do
it by only watching Kaidoh.

205
00:14:56,058 --> 00:14:58,725
The kid is really good.

206
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:00,125
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER): No joke.

207
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:04,392
That clown was able to hit my
snake shot just by watching me?

208
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:07,025
-It's not an easy
shot, Kaidoh, but I

209
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:10,325
happened to see an article on
that shot in a Tennis Magazine.

210
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:11,958
So I tried it.

211
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:13,725
After seeing you
hit the real thing,

212
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:16,992
I realized it's tough
without a long reach.

213
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:19,292
-Argh!

214
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:21,392
-He's got a
technique, all right.

215
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:24,392
But more than that,
Echizen obviously

216
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:29,025
has a lot of match experience
against high level opponents.

217
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:30,325
This match is over.

218
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,282
ANNOUNCER: Match point Echizen.

219
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:41,522
Echizen only needs
one point to win.

220
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:00,238
KAIDOH (VOICEOVER): No way.

221
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:01,973
I can't lose to the new kid.

222
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:03,973
Not me!

223
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:05,440
I'm Kaoru Kaidoh!

224
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:17,873
-Snake shot.

225
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:32,740
ANNOUNCER: Game, set, match.

226
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:34,107
Match goes to Echizen.

227
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:38,740
-The seventh grader won.

228
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:42,707
I can't believe it.

229
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,673
BOYS: Amazing.

230
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:44,340
Over Kaidoh.

231
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:45,673
I can't believe it.

232
00:16:51,682 --> 00:16:53,115
-He won!

233
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:54,615
KACHIRO: Ryoma won!

234
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:57,082
HORIO: He won!

235
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:57,549
Yay!

236
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:58,515
Awesome!

237
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:00,049
Yes!

238
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:01,515
-He made it, Sakuno!

239
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:13,849
Yeah!

240
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:14,349
-Huh?

241
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,282
-What's he doing?

242
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:29,882
-Huh?

243
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,149
-He's just a sore loser.

244
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,017
-Shake hands?

245
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:54,984
Uh, good game.

246
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:00,451
-Nice try, Kaidoh.

247
00:18:00,484 --> 00:18:02,517
-I'm not giving up
my place on the team.

248
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:05,817
Not to him.

249
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:06,451
-Nice job.

250
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:07,251
-You were great.

251
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:08,017
-Amazing.

252
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:08,851
-A seventh grader won.

253
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:09,651
-That was really cool, Ryoma.

254
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:10,651
-You're so cool.

255
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:11,984
-He's not even a
member of the team yet

256
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:13,784
and he beat one of the regulars.

257
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:15,151
Way to go.

258
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:17,784
-So the only players in Bracket
D who are still undefeated

259
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:21,951
are Echizen and you, Inui.

260
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:22,784
Am I right?

261
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:30,317
HORIO: I had faith.

262
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:34,784
I always believed Echizen
could beat Kaidoh.

263
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:37,951
KACHIRO: Horio, you're
always changing your story.

264
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:41,517
KATSUO: I was so
impressed with Ryoma.

265
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:43,451
I'm sure he'll be a starter.

266
00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:44,884
How lucky.

267
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,184
HORIO: But who knows?

268
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:48,417
Kaidoh was an eighth grader,
but Ryoma's next opponent

269
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:49,717
is a ninth grade regular, Inui.

270
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:54,617
Even Echizen won't be able to--

271
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:56,484
-Ryoma is gonna win!

272
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:57,151
-Hey.

273
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:57,917
Don't get so angry.

274
00:18:57,951 --> 00:18:59,051
RYOMA: Look.

275
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:00,651
It's not big deal.

276
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:03,617
Let's just finish cleaning up.

277
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:04,951
-Hey, Ryoma.

278
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:06,517
-You've been
practicing with a coach

279
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:08,517
since you were a baby, right?

280
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:10,151
Have you ever lost
in a tournament

281
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:11,717
when it really counts?

282
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,551
-I'm losing all the time.

283
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:14,251
-Huh?

284
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:16,351
-Aw, quit teasing us.

285
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:18,684
You wanna be a professional
player someday,

286
00:19:18,717 --> 00:19:19,717
isn't that right?

287
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:20,817
-Not really.

288
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:21,617
-No way!

289
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:22,951
Don't say that.

290
00:19:22,984 --> 00:19:25,417
-Ryoma, you're good enough
to make it as a professional!

291
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:28,217
-Not interested.

292
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,284
-What but why?

293
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:34,917
-Well, then why do you
bother even playing?

294
00:19:34,951 --> 00:19:36,051
Hey Echizen!

295
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:36,584
-Hm?

296
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:45,751
MAN (VOICEOVER): Ryoma's winning
the match against Kaidoh.

297
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:46,251
Amazing.

298
00:19:56,284 --> 00:19:59,251
Now I'm positive it's
gotta be his son.

299
00:19:59,284 --> 00:20:00,417
-Huh?

300
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:03,217
-I think we have to go
and see the boy's father.

301
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:04,684
-See him?

302
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:05,151
Who?

303
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:08,151
See who?

304
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:10,117
-His father, Nanjiro Echizen.

305
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:25,819
[theme music]

306
00:20:58,314 --> 00:21:00,514
-I'm Nanjiro Echizen.

307
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:01,556
call me Nanji.

308
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:04,289
A reporter named Inoue who
said he was a fan of mine

309
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:07,456
came to see me, but he only
asked about my son, Ryoma.

310
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:08,022
Heh.

311
00:21:08,056 --> 00:21:09,556
How insulting.

312
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:10,556
OK.

313
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:11,789
Let's play some
tennis, and I promise

314
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:13,489
I'll answer all your questions.

315
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,289
If you beat me.

316
00:21:15,322 --> 00:21:17,189
Next on "The Prince of Tennis."

317
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:18,689
Nanjiro Echizen.

318
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:20,556
Or how about this title?

319
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:22,989
The old man of tennis.

320
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:23,589
Huh?

321
00:21:23,622 --> 00:21:25,303
Why not?
