-Hey, did you hear?

00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,366
Some 12-year-old kid's playing
in the boy's sixteens today.

00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,800
Thank he'll win a match?

00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,100
-No way.

8
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:53,466
They must make some mistake
when they registered him.

9
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,866
-No, I heard it's for real.

10

Can you believe it?

-Whatever.

12
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,100
The whole idea is
totally ridiculous.

-Jeez.

14
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,200
You're stupid.

15

You don't even know
what grip you're using.

16
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:21,033
If you guys really want more
top spin, use the Western grip.

00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:23,033
Face the racket this way,
vertical, and hold the

You know, in order to
use a real Western grip,

33
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,633
you have to hold your racket
as if you're picking it up.
