[NARRATOR]
One hundred years have passed

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:16.224 position:50% align:center
since the Battle
of Galluah Plains,

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:19.936 position:50% align:center
where King Kyle defeated
the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.356 position:50% align:center
The Demons rise again,
threatening the world,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.192 position:50% align:center
spreading fear
and unrest to all.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:30.238 position:50% align:center
In order to find the key to
unseal the Holy Sword Aea,

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:33.950 position:50% align:center
Kasel and his friends arrive
at the Forest of Elidora.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.745 position:50% align:center
The elf princess,
Selene, guides them,

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:39.372 position:50% align:center
taking them to meet
with Master Lorraine.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:44.002 position:50% align:center
On their way, they encounter
a Demon and a baby treant.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:51.760 position:50% align:center
[KYLE screaming]

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:55.263 position:50% align:center
You Demon!

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:03.813 position:50% align:center
[SELENE]
Master Lorraine.

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:53.965 position:50% align:center
You must be Master Lorraine.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.593 position:50% align:center
Kasel, and all of you,

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:59.387 position:50% align:center
I thank you for saving
the Forest of Elidora.

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
On behalf of everyone here,

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:05.435 position:50% align:center
I offer all of you my
sincerest gratitude.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.396 position:50% align:center
I can't accept that.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.152 position:50% align:center
Because... I couldn't
protect... Chibi.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:18.490 position:50% align:center
Necha had much more curiosity
than any other little treant.

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.450 position:50% align:center
And I'm certain that
nothing made him happier

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.745 position:50% align:center
than to have spent some
time with all of you.

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:27.582 position:50% align:center
Necha will return to the
earth. Life is a cycle.

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:31.586 position:50% align:center
He'll sprout and grow once more,
rejoining his friends.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50% align:center
There is no reason
to be so upset.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.009 position:50% align:center
And, Selene, you were wonderful.

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:39.928 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:43.181 position:50% align:center
I know you came here
for a specific reason.

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:45.392 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Kasel?

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:46.351 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:47.602 position:50% align:center
I'm here to humbly ask

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:51.147 position:50% align:center
that you unseal the Holy
Sword Aea for me.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.734 position:50% align:center
You are the heir to
the Holy Sword Aea?

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:57.904 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I cannot
unseal it just yet.

00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.406 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
What?!

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.241 position:50% align:center
We came all the way out here

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
because Dominix
told us you could!

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:06.287 position:50% align:center
If you truly are the heir
to the Holy Sword,

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:09.791 position:50% align:center
the moment I undo the seal,
the power of the Goddess Lua

00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:12.377 position:50% align:center
will begin to flow into you.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
However, are you currently
worthy of wielding that power?

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.969 position:50% align:center
Please, I need to use
that power. I beg of you!

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
The Holy Sword Aea
has so much power,

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.307 position:50% align:center
it is capable of
defeating the Dark Lord.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:29.310 position:50% align:center
But if the sword is
not wielded properly,

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:32.564 position:50% align:center
Kasel, it could destroy
not only your body,

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
but your entire soul as well.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
That's fine. I don't care
about what happens to me.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.739 position:50% align:center
I need the power of the sword!

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
It's the only way I'll be
able to stop the Dark Lord!

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
Kasel, while I do understand
how you feel about this,

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
it is very late--let us continue
talking about it tomorrow.

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
[SELENE] This is Master
Lorraine's residence.

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
Please make use of this
room for the evening.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:14.689 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Wait.

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
Yes, what?

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
Would it be okay to bury Chibi?

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:19.986 position:50% align:center
Necha?

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Yes.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
I'd like to bury him in his
favorite spot if he had one.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.203 position:50% align:center
I'll take you.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.876 position:50% align:center
[SELENE] Necha always
loved to play right here

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center
underneath this tree.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:38.838 position:50% align:center
It suits him.

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50% align:center
Let's bury him here then.

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
[LORRAINE]
Can I lend you a hand?

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
You were so cute, Chibi.

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
I won't ever forget you.
You touched our hearts.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:21.339 position:50% align:center
Selene, may I have a
moment of your time?

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center
[CLEO grunts]

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50% align:center
I thought she'd undo the seal

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center
the second we all got
to the Forest of Elidora.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.394 position:50% align:center
You may have thought that,

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:37.564 position:50% align:center
but Master Lorraine has
her reasons for waiting.

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center
And how are you
doing with all this?

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:44.654 position:50% align:center
[KASEL] I'm fine. I'm just
gonna go for a walk.

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:51.286 position:50% align:center
[SELENE] Um. What do you
want to talk about?

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
[LORRAINE] Earlier, when
you were with the humans,

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.207 position:50% align:center
how did Kasel seem to you?

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.084 position:50% align:center
How did he seem?

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:00.670 position:50% align:center
I'm asking if you think
that he is worthy

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
of inheriting the
Holy Sword Aea.

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:05.884 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50% align:center
[SELENE] Why are you
asking me about this?

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
I trust you and
wanted your opinion.

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
You want-- My opinion
doesn't matter.

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.106 position:50% align:center
You were with Kasel
and his friends.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.651 position:50% align:center
You interacted with him and
saw his personality up close.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:26.696 position:50% align:center
Selene, I have trust in you.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.782 position:50% align:center
Tell me your thoughts.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50% align:center
I just... don't know.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.169 position:50% align:center
I see then.

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:44.589 position:50% align:center
Please take your time
thinking about it.

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:46.091 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.058 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:59.604 position:50% align:center
What exactly can she be
expecting me to say about him?

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:02.273 position:50% align:center
The heir to the Holy Sword...

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:05.652 position:50% align:center
Is Kasel really King Kyle's son?

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:08.905 position:50% align:center
I know Master Lorraine fought
with King Kyle 100 years ago

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.824 position:50% align:center
to defeat the Dark Lord.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
But... is Kasel
the kind of person

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:18.623 position:50% align:center
people will choose to follow,
like King Kyle was back then?

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:22.127 position:50% align:center
I don't know if a man who lets
himself get so lost in anger

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.671 position:50% align:center
can handle wielding
the Holy Sword.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.756 position:50% align:center
I just don't know.

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.092 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Chibi, I tried to protect you.

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.855 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:45.775 position:50% align:center
But instead, you saved my life.

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.694 position:50% align:center
And I--

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:51.197 position:50% align:center
All I did was lose
myself to anger.

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:55.160 position:50% align:center
Even though we killed it,
that was just dumb luck.

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center
That's not the strength I need.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:09:00.415 position:50% align:center
I won't lose anyone, no more.

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
I have to be stronger.

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:17.265 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Huh?

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:21.853 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:24.397 position:50% align:center
[SELENE]
It's a treant sprout.

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.567 position:50% align:center
When treants die,
they eventually sprout anew,

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.363 position:50% align:center
and their life cycle
begins once again.

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.656 position:50% align:center
This is Chibi?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.702 position:50% align:center
Yes, but it usually
doesn't happen so fast.

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:39.788 position:50% align:center
It's unbelievable.

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50% align:center
Perhaps Necha can sense that
all of us are missing him

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50% align:center
and wants to cheer
his friends up.

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:51.716 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Thank you, Chibi.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:57.681 position:50% align:center
I'll work to get stronger.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
Did you all get enough
sleep last night?

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:07.816 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
[LORRAINE]
Before we continue...

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
Have you made a decision
after our talk, Selene?

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:15.115 position:50% align:center
[SELENE]
Yes.

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:16.366 position:50% align:center
Did you get that?

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
No.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
Before last night,

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.663 position:50% align:center
I truly believed all humans
were destroyers--

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
creatures that were a threat
to all of us here in the forest.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:28.837 position:50% align:center
I thought humans were selfish,
with no self-control,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.756 position:50% align:center
but then, Kasel and all of
his companions rushed in

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.468 position:50% align:center
to help the Forest of Elidora
fight against that plant Demon.

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:38.722 position:50% align:center
They all acted selflessly.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.181 position:50% align:center
What I saw was very different

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
from how I believed
humans to act.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:47.480 position:50% align:center
So then, tell me, why didn't
you answer me last night?

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:50.358 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure yet.

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
I mean, even though Kasel
did defeat the plant Demon,

00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
when he lost Necha, it seemed
he lost control of himself.

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
He flailed his sword
carelessly in anger.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:08.543 position:50% align:center
At first, I thought if a human
like him gained power,

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:12.255 position:50% align:center
he might use it against the
Forest of Elidora for evil.

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:14.924 position:50% align:center
That was what I feared.

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:18.345 position:50% align:center
But now, I realize
that he understood.

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:21.765 position:50% align:center
He understood that what he
felt then was not strength.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
What he seeks is true power.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:27.979 position:50% align:center
Master Lorraine, I honestly
believe Kasel is worthy

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:31.566 position:50% align:center
of inheriting the power
of the Holy Sword Aea.

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
That is the conclusion
I've reached.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
And I think Necha would
agree with me as well.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:41.409 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Princess Selene.

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:45.789 position:50% align:center
No, I-I'm simply stating
the truth of what I observed.

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:49.376 position:50% align:center
Selene, it seems your thoughts
about humans have changed

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:52.837 position:50% align:center
and the walls around your heart
have come down a little bit.

00:11:57.467 --> 00:12:00.220 position:50% align:center
I've already explained
the Holy Sword's power

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
and what it might do to you.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
Are you certain you haven't
changed your mind?

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.060 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.156 position:50% align:center
Kasel also has all of us
with him by his side.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.074 position:50% align:center
He does.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.617 position:50% align:center
Yeah, if something goes wrong,

00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:25.995 position:50% align:center
I'm here to use my magic
and make things explode!

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
A century ago, King Kyle had
the help of friends, too,

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
in his fight against
the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
You resemble him, you know.

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
I suppose you'll take
after your father.

Selene.

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:43.513 position:50% align:center
Before, I fought
alongside the humans.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.557 position:50% align:center
We helped one another
in the fight.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.144 position:50% align:center
Together, we had the same goal:
To defeat the Dark Lord.

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:52.147 position:50% align:center
All of us being different
races didn't matter to us.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.649 position:50% align:center
It didn't stop us
from working together.

[CLEO chuckles]

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:04.719 position:50% align:center
It's true. You are indeed
the heir to the Holy Sword.

00:14:04.803 --> 00:14:07.389 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec, that's
all you had to do?

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:10.308 position:50% align:center
What's it like? Do you
feel more powerful?

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
Is strength filling up
inside of you?

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
Do you feel the need to go out
and kick some serious butt?

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:18.191 position:50% align:center
It doesn't... feel different.

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:19.150 position:50% align:center
[CLEO sighs]

00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
You will feel the power soon.

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
Eventually you will begin
to feel stronger.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
Well, at least this means

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:30.370 position:50% align:center
we've taken care of one
of the seals already.

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
Yes, but there are two more
locks that still remain.

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
One of them is with Aeatola,

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:40.296 position:50% align:center
the leader of the orcs
in Ogria Mountain.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.259 position:50% align:center
And the other is with Pavel
in Windland Snow Mountain,

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
which is even further
away than Ogria Mountain.

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:51.683 position:50% align:center
You must visit both
of these mountains.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.852 position:50% align:center
Yes. I understand.

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:56.396 position:50% align:center
Right, so let's get moving then.

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:57.856 position:50% align:center

But how?

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.049 position:50% align:center
We defeated that one.

I heard some Demons can survive

I wish you well on your journey

I can sense you'll be
supported by many allies,

and their bonds will
only strengthen you.

that I trust all humans,

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:40.667 position:50% align:center
But I... I do trust you

Hmph. Those fools.

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center
They came crying to me
for help after all.

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
They want the Black Edge
to defeat the Demons

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
in the King's Forest
by themselves.

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:17.495 position:50% align:center
They seem to want to keep their
own knights close at hand.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.957 position:50% align:center
It would benefit us
if they owe us a favor.

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.667 position:50% align:center
This is a great
opportunity for you

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
to work towards
becoming a knight.

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:26.129 position:50% align:center
If you did become a knight,

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:28.715 position:50% align:center
that would be extremely
fortunate for you,

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:31.051 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
Of course, the Black Edge
would have a great deal

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:35.555 position:50% align:center
of gratitude toward
you for your help.

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
Exactly.

I am purposefully having
you gain some power

to help me silence those
nagging politicians.

I want the Black Edge to
appear more impressive

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:48.234 position:50% align:center
than their knights.

groundwork for you.

N-No. I have to...

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
I have to stay and protect
the Forest of Elidora.

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
Right, of course.

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
But still...

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:32.070 position:50% align:center
We're finally out of the woods!

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:34.489 position:50% align:center
Our next stop will
be Ogria Mountain.

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
But it's quite a far
distance away from here.

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:41.079 position:50% align:center
However, there are some towns
and villages along the way.

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
We should gather some
useful information there

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.374 position:50% align:center
as we move forward.

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't Master Aeatola's
orc settlement

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
be pretty easy for us to find?

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
Perhaps, but we should
rest and resupply, too.

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:53.466 position:50% align:center
Or would you prefer
to walk non-stop?

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.926 position:50% align:center
Oh, no thanks.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
I wonder if the heroes
from 100 years ago

00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
travelled like this, too.

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
I think back then, it was more
like how it is during wartime.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:05.311 position:50% align:center
You know, more like a big army
of knights marching around.

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:07.939 position:50% align:center
King Kyle did lead
an army back then.

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:09.315 position:50% align:center
I just thought of something!

00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't Kasel be a prince
if times were different?

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.195 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's not too late
to tell everyone!

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
I don't want to tell everyone!

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
I'm still just me.
Regular old Kasel.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.579 position:50% align:center
You're King Kyle's son,
but only an apprentice knight?

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:25.206 position:50% align:center
I'd be embarrassed, too.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
It makes more sense
for him to hide it.

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:28.626 position:50% align:center
Technically, when
you think about it,

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.962 position:50% align:center
