[NARRATOR]
One hundred years have passed

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.182 position:50% align:center
since the Battle
of Galluah Plains,

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.686 position:50% align:center
where King Kyle defeated
the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.856 position:50% align:center
The Demons rise again,
threatening the world,

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.067 position:50% align:center
spreading fear
and unrest to all.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
Princess Scarlet
allows the Black Edge

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.823 position:50% align:center
to join the knights of Orvelia.

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
And thanks to their efforts
taking out the Demons,

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:39.914 position:50% align:center
the Black Edge begins to gain
the trust of the townsfolk.

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:41.249 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
What is this?

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center
They've totally changed
their attitude toward us.

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center
We cannot trust
the people of Orvelia.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.384 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I know.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.152 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSMAN A] The Black Edge
have finally returned!

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:36.698 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSGIRL A]
Hi, Azal!

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:38.825 position:50% align:center
They're acting like
we're heroes now.

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:40.160 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.704 position:50% align:center
Hah. Gotta love how they've
all changed their tune

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.497 position:50% align:center
now that we're protecting them.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.624 position:50% align:center
I don't trust humans
for a second.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.588 position:50% align:center
Come on, guys. This is better
than them bad-mouthing us.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.011 position:50% align:center
I want nothing more

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:01.306 position:50% align:center
than for all the humans
of Orvelia to die.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:04.642 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Hm?

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:10.398 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.527 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.613 position:50% align:center
I've gotta go do something.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.031 position:50% align:center
I'll meet up later.

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.532 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:24.788 position:50% align:center
[TAMM] Hey. Who was the
girl I saw here before?

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.706 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're talking about Sheila!

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
She actually doesn't work here.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.709 position:50% align:center
She works at the bakery
up the street.

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
I believe she should be there
now if you're looking for her.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:34.714 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Thanks!

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

[CLAUSE]
Hm? Hello, Riheet.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50% align:center
How were things in
the King's Forest?

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
It was the same.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
Thank you, understood.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET] I've already
submitted my report.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:52.357 position:50% align:center
We truly appreciate
your hard work.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
By the way, I wanted to speak
to you about something else.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.904 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
Hm? Yes, what is it?

00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
I would like to
thank you personally

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.992 position:50% align:center
for rescuing my friends
from Demons in the forest.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
Do you recall Kasel
the apprentice knight

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
and Frey the priestess?

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.585 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:17.173 position:50% align:center
[CLAUSE] I'm grateful
that you saved them.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
So thank you.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:22.262 position:50% align:center
I don't remember anything
about these friends of yours.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET] How have you been
feeling lately, Father?

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center
Scarlet, getting to
see your lovely face

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
always makes me feel better.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
I wish I could stay by your
side more. I'm sorry I can't.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Do not worry.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
Behl has told me about how hard
you're working with the knights.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
Tell me more about the Black
Edge. Are they trustworthy?

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.123 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:52.751 position:50% align:center
They were highly recommended
to me directly by Lord Moriham

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
and they've delivered amazing
results fighting the Demons.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
Lord Moriham.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
How does he have connections
with dark elves?

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.722 position:50% align:center
You're too much like
your mother, my dear.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:08.475 position:50% align:center
You're far too
trusting of people.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.810 position:50% align:center
[KING]
It worries me.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50% align:center
You don't have
to worry about me.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
You need to rest, Father.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:21.946 position:50% align:center
Get well soon, so we can show
the people that you are healthy.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.782 position:50% align:center
I will.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
[DEMIA] Are you doing
all right, Princess?

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:40.965 position:50% align:center
You have seemed
a bit tired lately.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:46.471 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET] Thank you, but I can
assure you I am just fine.

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
[DEMIA] I know you've been
working non-stop recently

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
and you've hardly
gotten any sleep.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.603 position:50% align:center
The Day of Lea is
rapidly approaching.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50% align:center
I cannot stop and rest now.

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.066 position:50% align:center
We have to be
prepared for anything.

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50% align:center
[DEMIA] Do you believe
the Dark Lord Angmund

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
will actually appear again?

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:07.867 position:50% align:center
I honestly don't know.

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I think it would
be in our best interest

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
to assume the worst.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.749 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:18.044 position:50% align:center
Thank you for being by
my side during this time.

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
If you had led the life
of a noble's daughter,

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50% align:center
you could've avoided fighting
the Demon's altogether.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.096 position:50% align:center
There's a memory I wish to share
with you, Your Highness.

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
Do you remember the
first time I saw you

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center
training with your sword?

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center
I'll never forget the question
I posed to you that day.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:38.940 position:50% align:center
As a princess, why do you
need to use a sword?

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.984 position:50% align:center
And you replied:

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:44.446 position:50% align:center
"The duty of the royal family
is to protect the nation,

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:48.158 position:50% align:center
not to wear pretty dresses
and dance at parties."

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.368 position:50% align:center
Yes, I remember that.

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:52.537 position:50% align:center
When I saw the determined
look in your eyes,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
I swore an oath to you.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.583 position:50% align:center
If you were to fight
with the sword,

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.127 position:50% align:center
I would become your shield.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.795 position:50% align:center
Demia.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
I promise to protect you,
Your Highness.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:13.475 position:50% align:center
Oh, you've returned.
Wonderful. Job done?

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:14.601 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.436 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET]
I'd like to speak with you.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
I'll be along to the meeting
room in a moment.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:20.607 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
[TAMM grunts]

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:35.538 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Huh?

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
[BOY A]
Hey! You're in the Black Edge!

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
[TAMM grunts]

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:42.045 position:50% align:center
[BOY B]
What are you doing here?

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:45.131 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, well, I--

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:48.134 position:50% align:center
Sheila! Someone from
the Black Edge is here!

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:50.053 position:50% align:center
Hey! Not so loud!

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.596 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.433 position:50% align:center
Oh, hi there.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET]
As per your suggestion,

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.814 position:50% align:center
we are sending troops
to the country--

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.857 position:50% align:center
we must protect the villages.

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50% align:center
That is a wise decision.

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
I agree with what you said.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
Orvelia is so focused
on keeping its nobles

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center
comfortable and happy.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.288 position:50% align:center
Taking a step back, I realized
I needed to think more

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.499 position:50% align:center
about the ordinary citizens.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
When my father was healthy,

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50% align:center
he was always away,
fighting wars to protect us.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
Father would've done anything
to keep Orvelia safe.

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center
He defended us
against all invaders.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.223 position:50% align:center
However, he left
our domestic affairs

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:39.352 position:50% align:center
in the hands of the nobles,
and this is the result.

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:41.271 position:50% align:center
The nobles get their way

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:44.190 position:50% align:center
while the common
people remain ignored.

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:47.694 position:50% align:center
It must defend the people
in my father's stead.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:51.656 position:50% align:center
This is my duty as the princess.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.328 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you.

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50% align:center
You always have an invisible
wall up in front of you.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:08.214 position:50% align:center
And I don't recall a time where
you have ever let it down.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
The same could be said for you.

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.304 position:50% align:center
Perhaps that is true.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50% align:center
Tell me, why are you willing
to fight Demons for us?

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:21.227 position:50% align:center
I get the sense you're not
doing it for money alone.

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.355 position:50% align:center
What is the other reason?

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:29.027 position:50% align:center
Fighting Demons is all I can do.
It's the only talent I have.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50% align:center
That's why I fight them,
it's that simple.

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:47.962 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
I'm here!

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:50.882 position:50% align:center
Sorry to keep you waiting!
I had to finish my work!

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
No, I shouldn't have just
dropped in like that.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.472 position:50% align:center
No, don't worry! So...
why did you come to see me?

00:09:57.555 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
I wanted to... Here.

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
You came all the way
here just to return this?

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
I ran into the baker and
asked where you were

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50% align:center
so I could bring
this back to you.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
I'm Sheila. What's your name?

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:13.321 position:50% align:center
Tamm. Oh, and I washed
it for you, by the way!

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:16.366 position:50% align:center
Thank you. Is your injury okay?

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's all good.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't know
what happened,

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
but I was really very
worried about you.

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:25.709 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about me!

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:26.876 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't been sick,

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.878 position:50% align:center
I could've taken those
guys down easily.

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA chuckles]

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.799 position:50% align:center
I see. Next time I'll make
you a homemade treat!

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center
You're fighting the
Demons for us.

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:37.429 position:50% align:center
I think that you at least
deserve something special

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:39.973 position:50% align:center
as a thank you!

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's not a problem.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.441 position:50% align:center
[BLACK EDGE MEMBER B]
Finally, we get a decent meal!

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:50.650 position:50% align:center
[BLACK EDGE MEMBER A]
Yeah, we've been out

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:53.361 position:50% align:center
in the King's Forest
for way too long.

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:55.405 position:50% align:center
[BLACK EDGE MEMBER B] Tonight,
I'm drinkin' until I get sick!

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:58.283 position:50% align:center
I'm starved!

00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.868 position:50% align:center
And where were you?

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.954 position:50% align:center
Uh, I had a small errand.

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:04.456 position:50% align:center
What did you do?

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:06.416 position:50% align:center
You were probably off playin'
stupid games or somethin'

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
like a little kid!

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:12.005 position:50% align:center
That's not it at all!
Seriously...

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Mmm!

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.890 position:50% align:center
According to our
astrologer, Ophelia,

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:24.934 position:50% align:center
the Day of the Goddess of
Darkness is quickly approaching.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:27.228 position:50% align:center
It is possible we may
witness the second coming

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.439 position:50% align:center
of the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.608 position:50% align:center
We will not let that happen!

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.068 position:50% align:center
Agreed!

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
No matter what, we must prevent
his return to our world.

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
I am open to honest opinions
on how to do this.

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET] Do we have any idea
where the resurrection ritual

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
would take place?

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:49.376 position:50% align:center
We do. It'll be here.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:52.754 position:50% align:center
The ruins of the Republic of
Grey, on the Galluah Plains.

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
This is where the Dark Lord
appeared 100 years ago.

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.511 position:50% align:center
We should investigate
that area immediately.

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:01.096 position:50% align:center
Yes, I agree.

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:03.056 position:50% align:center
However, this time,
I believe we must send

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
more than a scouting party.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:07.686 position:50% align:center
If someone there is planning
the return of the Dark Lord,

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
we must remove that
threat immediately.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:14.234 position:50% align:center
Please allow the Black
Edge to be the vanguard.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
[DEMIA] We are not accustomed to
the world outside the kingdom.

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center
They would be a
good fit for this.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:26.496 position:50% align:center
Understood. We shall
prepare to move out!

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:27.914 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:39.676 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
Ta-da!

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:42.178 position:50% align:center
I think this is one
of my best batches.

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Uh, thank you.

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.850 position:50% align:center
I can't remember the
last time I had cake.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
Do you not get to have
cake on your birthday?

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:52.939 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't celebrate
my birthday.

00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:54.232 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
Hm?

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center
Forget it.

00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:58.737 position:50% align:center
Hey, I was wondering,

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
is it okay for you to be
spending time with me?

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:03.324 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
Hm? Of course!

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:04.659 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:06.786 position:50% align:center
I really don't want people
to speak badly about you

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
or anything like that.

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50% align:center
You're part of the Black Edge--
heroes that protect Orvelia!

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:15.045 position:50% align:center
No one should have
a problem with that.

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but humans don't
really like dark elves.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
Who cares what you are?
All that matters is you're you!

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Huh?

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
Why don't you try the cake?

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
Uh, right. It looks so good.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:33.063 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
You like it?

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.231 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! Delicious!

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad!

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:41.654 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
There's more if you want.

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.573 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Yeah! Thanks!

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.120 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
I'm back!

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:53.833 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's going on,
guys? We eating?

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
Why are you getting
back so late?

00:13:56.252 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
Uh, I needed to go shopping,
but the place was far away,

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:03.551 position:50% align:center
and I might've
gotten a little lost.

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:04.969 position:50% align:center
Tamm!

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.265 position:50% align:center
Stop lying!

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
We know you're sneaking out
to meet with a human girl!

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:16.690 position:50% align:center
Did you tell her about
all of our plans?

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.316 position:50% align:center
No. I didn't--

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.360 position:50% align:center
[AZAL]
Don't lie to me!

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:23.321 position:50% align:center
Stop it.

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:25.573 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
What's going on?

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
[AZAL] He was meeting with
an Orvelian girl in secret.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.954 position:50% align:center
He even lied to us about it!

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:35.875 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you guys.

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
She helped me before!
She's a nice person!

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.755 position:50% align:center
Stand.

00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
That was careless,

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:52.308 position:50% align:center
but I don't believe your
actions were malicious.

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:55.520 position:50% align:center
They weren't.

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:59.232 position:50% align:center
We must be careful.
This is a most important time.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.026 position:50% align:center
You understand that, yes?

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:07.907 position:50% align:center
Take a moment and think
about what we're doing.

00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:09.826 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Understood.

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE]
You're an idiot.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:28.511 position:50% align:center
Go away.

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:31.056 position:50% align:center
Why are you acting so selfish?

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:32.849 position:50% align:center
Things are going well for us,

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
but when you do something
like this, it causes unrest.

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:40.398 position:50% align:center
She made me happy.

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:44.486 position:50% align:center
Nobody ever thanked me before,
so I appreciated it.

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:46.279 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE]
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
We're not doing this
so people thank us.

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:50.950 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
I know that.

00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:54.954 position:50% align:center
But everyone in town is
grateful. Sheila is, too.

00:15:55.038 --> 00:15:58.416 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE] So the girl who stole
your heart is named Sheila, huh?

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.793 position:50% align:center
[TAMM gasps]

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:02.671 position:50% align:center
How long are you
going to be angry?

00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center
Why not be happy
with where we are

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
instead of just focusing
on getting revenge?

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
My brother will become
the leader of this country.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
The people who hurt dark elves
before will have to obey him.

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:17.686 position:50% align:center
Helping my brother is my dream.

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.354 position:50% align:center
The thought of being
happy without him

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:22.440 position:50% align:center
never crossed my mind.

00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:24.150 position:50% align:center
After our parents were killed,

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:27.696 position:50% align:center
my brother did everything
he could to protect me.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.951 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
Just a little bit further!

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow we'll get to the town!

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:38.498 position:50% align:center
There won't be any Orvelian
soldiers. We'll be okay.

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:43.586 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
Hm? What's wrong?

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
I'm hungry.

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
I think I have a little
bit of bread left.

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:53.388 position:50% align:center
Eat this.

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:56.182 position:50% align:center
But then you won't have any.

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:59.310 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine. I'm not
even that hungry.

00:16:59.394 --> 00:17:02.313 position:50% align:center
Just go ahead and take it.

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE]
Okay.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center
Delicious.

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.327 position:50% align:center
Ever since that day,

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:19.831 position:50% align:center
I swore I would do anything
to help my brother.

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:24.377 position:50% align:center
It was my decision to join the
Black Edge, no one else's.

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.590 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE] Do you know what
the opposite of revenge is?

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:30.467 position:50% align:center
No.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center
I personally like to think
that it's forgiveness.

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
Forgiveness?

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:38.600 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE] I don't know what
kind of person Sheila is.

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
What I do know is that she's an
Orvelian and you are a dark elf.

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:44.814 position:50% align:center
That won't ever change.

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:46.983 position:50% align:center
Can you accept these things?

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
Can you forgive the humans
after what they did?

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE] If leaving the Black
Edge makes you happy,

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.911 position:50% align:center
then I won't stop you.

00:17:57.994 --> 00:18:02.374 position:50% align:center
However, if you do something
to get in my brother's way...

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
...I will kill you,
do you understand me?

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Yeah. I get it.

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:14.886 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Sheila!

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:20.392 position:50% align:center
You're late today--
did something happen?

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:24.521 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Here. These are for you.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.567 position:50% align:center
They're so pretty!

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:32.946 position:50% align:center
Well, I've actually never
given anyone a present before,

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
so I was a little bit unsure
of what to get you.

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:40.370 position:50% align:center
I like these a lot.
Thanks so much.

00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
I didn't know how to
explain it to you before,

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
but I don't celebrate
my birthday

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
because I don't like it.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:50.964 position:50% align:center
When I was a kid,

00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center
my mother baked a cake for
all of us on my birthday.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:58.555 position:50% align:center
It was a really small one
with just some sugar on top,

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
but it made me smile.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
My little brothers wanted
to dive right in,

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:07.480 position:50% align:center
but I told them we had to wait
for our dad to come home.

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:11.484 position:50% align:center
But that day, Dad didn't
return until really late.

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
When he finally got home,
I opened the door...

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
...and I saw him
covered in blood.

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.118 position:50% align:center
"You have to run now."

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
Those were his last
words before he died.

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
And right after, Orvelian
soldiers came to our village

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.793 position:50% align:center
and set it on fire.

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
According to what
the soldiers said,

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
they attacked us
because some dark elves

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:35.800 position:50% align:center
were supposedly plotting
an attack on Orvelia.

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
But that was a lie.

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:42.932 position:50% align:center
And you could tell... they
enjoyed their little massacre.

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
That's horrible.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:49.647 position:50% align:center
My mother died protecting all
of us--me and my brothers.

00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
After that, they passed
away from hunger.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.570 position:50% align:center
I was never able
to find them food.

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
I honestly don't remember

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center
how I got out of the
village back then.

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:04.120 position:50% align:center
I ran away and I was eventually
rescued by the other survivors.

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:07.082 position:50% align:center
We became the Black Edge.

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:10.585 position:50% align:center
Ever since then, I can't seem
to celebrate my birthday.

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
It would keep reminding me
of all those awful memories.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.258 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
I'm sorry you're crying.

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:20.637 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean for my
story to upset you.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.930 position:50% align:center
But unfortunately,

00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:24.933 position:50% align:center
there's an invisible wall
between the two of us,

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
and I have no idea
if there's any way

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
I can get rid of that wall.

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
Hold on!

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
Then why do you fight to protect
Orvelia from the Demons?

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
Don't get the wrong
idea about me.

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
I don't fight for Orvelia.

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:43.243 position:50% align:center
We're not here to
be your heroes.

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
[gapss]

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
That said, I plan on
changing this world.

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
I promise. It will become
a place without sadness.

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
Goodbye, Sheila.

00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:04.055 position:50% align:center
[MORIHAM] Everything is
going quite smoothly.

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:07.017 position:50% align:center
The people in Orvelia used
to stare at you with fear,

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
and now you're heroes!

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.896 position:50% align:center
It makes the wine even sweeter.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.190 position:50% align:center
Once the Demons
have been dealt with,

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
everyone will forget
what it is that we did.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.990 position:50% align:center
Now you see why we must climb
to the top of the ranks.

00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:07.887 position:50% align:center
This must be the Red Valley!

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.436 position:50% align:center
We finally made it to
where the orcs live.

00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:17.814 position:50% align:center
Right, we did. Let's push on.

00:23:17.897 --> 00:23:19.774 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Yeah.

00:23:19.858 --> 00:23:23.153 position:50% align:center
I've heard that orcs are
aggressive and love to fight.

00:23:23.236 --> 00:23:24.904 position:50% align:center
They say that the
rocks get their color

00:23:24.988 --> 00:23:27.115 position:50% align:center
from all the blood spilled here.

00:23:27.198 --> 00:23:30.368 position:50% align:center
That's where it gets its name.

00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:33.204 position:50% align:center
I don't know how much
of that story is true,

00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:35.582 position:50% align:center
but I do think it would be
wise to approach the orcs

00:23:35.665 --> 00:23:37.751 position:50% align:center
with extreme caution.

00:23:37.834 --> 00:23:39.210 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:48.678 position:50% align:center
[FREY] The voices of
the dead echo around us

00:23:48.762 --> 00:23:50.638 position:50% align:center
in the Red Valley.

00:23:50.722 --> 00:23:53.099 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, Demons
have already begun

00:23:53.183 --> 00:23:55.810 position:50% align:center
to threaten Ogria Mountain.

00:23:55.894 --> 00:23:57.979 position:50% align:center
The orcs point their
swords at us,

00:23:58.063 --> 00:24:00.857 position:50% align:center
strangers they have
no reason to trust.
