[NARRATOR]
One hundred years have passed

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.016 position:50% align:center
since the Battle
of Galluah Plains,

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.477 position:50% align:center
where King Kyle defeated
the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.230 position:50% align:center
However, the Demons
have risen again,

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:23.523 position:50% align:center
threatening the world,

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
spreading fear and unrest
throughout the land.

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:30.697 position:50% align:center
Kasel, an apprentice knight,
journeyed to the King's Forest

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.323 position:50% align:center
to search for his friends,

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.451 position:50% align:center
and protect those
dearest to him.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.828 position:50% align:center
That's why I have to go.

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
Why are you leaving?

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.917 position:50% align:center
I have to go find Clause.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:26.604 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:28.273 position:50% align:center
Is that...?

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.705 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.291 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:52.797 position:50% align:center
That looks like Flegg.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:56.760 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:15.111 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Where's Clause!

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.953 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
This is Clause's shield!

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.206 position:50% align:center
Uh! Oh, no.

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
It's not him, Clause.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Huh? Where are you going?

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
I have to find Clause!

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.441 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Wait, Kasel!

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:54.734 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Frey!

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
No, Demons.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:14.921 position:50% align:center
Run now, Frey!

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.007 position:50% align:center
No, wait!

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
Right. Bring it on!

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.244 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Hurry!

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.914 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
Let's have fun, little boy.

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
Kasel!

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.887 position:50% align:center
Is that all you've got?

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.973 position:50% align:center
But still... you look familiar.

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Watch out!

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
All right, Riheet, we'll
take care of this group.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
Good.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center
[MARIA] Just when I was
starting to have so much fun.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
Must you interfere?

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.712 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
Amazing.

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
You're not bad.

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:17.210 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE]
This way!

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:19.295 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Yeah!

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
Let's play again
soon, little boy.

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.174 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
Until next time.

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
Who was that, a Demon?

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
I believe so.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.066 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE] Looks like you
finished up your battle.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.862 position:50% align:center
Aww, man! I wanted to
get in on the action, too!

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:46.031 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you leave
any of them for me, huh?

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.116 position:50% align:center
You took too long.

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:52.078 position:50% align:center
Brother, who are they?

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
We're from Orvelia.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:56.458 position:50% align:center
I'm a guardian knight.
I go by the name Kasel.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center
And this here is Frey.

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much for
your help with the Demons.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.424 position:50% align:center
We weren't trying to help you.

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
We were commissioned to
destroy all of the Demons.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.762 position:50% align:center
Commissioned?

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50% align:center
Orvelia hired all of us--
we're mercenaries.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Orvelia did?

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.269 position:50% align:center
What are the two of
you doing out here?

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
You don't seem to be part
of the scouting party.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.398 position:50% align:center
One of our friends is a scout

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
and we came to see
if he was safe.

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:27.030 position:50% align:center
Huh? Heh. Pretty sure
the scouts died.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
That's why your people
got all of us involved

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.076 position:50% align:center
in this giant mess.

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:34.245 position:50% align:center
I can't believe that all
the scouts are dead.

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:37.248 position:50% align:center
There must be survivors.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET] After seeing
all this, are you sure?

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:47.926 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
Let's go.

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
[AZAL]
Yeah.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
[TAMM chuckles]

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:58.812 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Kasel.

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:05.151 position:50% align:center
Some healing magic.

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:07.654 position:50% align:center
I can heal any small
wounds you have.

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:10.156 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Frey.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.158 position:50% align:center
I came to help Clause,

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50% align:center
but I couldn't even defeat
a single Demon by myself.

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:19.332 position:50% align:center
How can I hope
to protect anyone?

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.042 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:22.252 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
Who's there?

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.881 position:50% align:center
[ROI] Hold on,
we're not the enemy.

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:29.175 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
There's no reason to be alarmed.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:31.761 position:50% align:center
Even if this guy is pretty
suspicious looking.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.972 position:50% align:center
Watch it.

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] Anyway, think you can
you put the pointy object away?

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.274 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.
My name is Cleo.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
A sorceress!

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.780 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Sorceress?

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
And I'm Roi. I'm the
one who babysits her.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.036 position:50% align:center
No, Roi, you're my bodyguard!

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.746 position:50% align:center
[ROI]
Same thing.

00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:59.164 position:50% align:center
No, It's not!

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
Um, so who exactly
are you two?

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:04.544 position:50% align:center
Oh! We came to find you.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.255 position:50% align:center
You're Kasel and
you're Frey, right?

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
How did you know?

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] Oh, great,
we found the right people!

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.555 position:50% align:center
I wanna take you somewhere,
so follow me, okay?

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.140 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Wait, what do you mean?

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.184 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] If you follow me,
you'll find out.

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.477 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's go then.

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:32.947 position:50% align:center
And we're here!

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
We're here, but, um,

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:37.535 position:50% align:center
there doesn't seem
to be anything here.

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.120 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
Now, now, calm down.
I'll explain everything.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
There's a person who
asked for our help.

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
He told us you two were
headed for the King's Forest,

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
and he wanted us
to bring you here.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.675 position:50% align:center
What person?

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.386 position:50% align:center
It's Dominix.

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:55.845 position:50% align:center
Dominix?

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:58.431 position:50% align:center
Wait, the sorcerer who lives
in the Tower of the Sage?

00:09:58.515 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Right!

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
I was told that you're all
familiar with each other.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
Yes, he often visited
the two of us

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:06.189 position:50% align:center
at the orphanage
where we grew up.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
But why does he
want to see us now?

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.528 position:50% align:center
[ROI] Dominix will fill
you in on the details.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.988 position:50% align:center
Great! So let's get going.

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
Going? Go where?

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50% align:center
Isn't it obvious?

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center
We're going up!

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
We're going up there?

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.725 position:50% align:center
Yup, that's right,
to the Tower of the Sage.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.268 position:50% align:center
But how do we get up there?

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
I thought only the chosen ones

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center
were allowed to enter
the Tower of the Sage.

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
[CLEO chuckles]

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
You're looking at a chosen one!

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.153 position:50% align:center
Me!

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:59.284 position:50% align:center
And now we go...

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:01.745 position:50% align:center
...up to the tower!

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Right! Here we are!

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.607 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
It's incredible!

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.114 position:50% align:center
Hey, come on, you two!

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:41.659 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] What are you doing?
Hurry up and get over here.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.834 position:50% align:center
Most of the people
here are sorcerers

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:53.797 position:50% align:center
or scholars, all studying and
training under the Great Sage.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
The Great Sage, what can
you tell me about him?

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center
What can I tell you about him?

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:01.805 position:50% align:center
Well, actually,
I think he's a freak.

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:03.431 position:50% align:center
He's supposed to be super old,

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:05.016 position:50% align:center
but he maintains
his young appearance

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.851 position:50% align:center
by using his magical powers.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:09.229 position:50% align:center
You should be careful
with your words.

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
What if someone might hear you?

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:15.026 position:50% align:center
I don't care if they hear.
What I said is true!

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.161 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
We're all here!

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Mr. Dominix!

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
Ah, Kasel, Frey, I've been
waiting for you two.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
It's been ages.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50% align:center
I believe the last
time we saw you

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
was when we were still little
kids at the orphanage.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
Why, yes, and I see
that the two of you

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:46.641 position:50% align:center
are all grown up now.

00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:49.352 position:50% align:center
You haven't changed
at all, Mr. Dominix.

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:50.770 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's true.

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
You look exactly the same
since we last saw you.

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:57.444 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] See, I told you!
He's a total freak.

00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
'Cause Dominix is
the Great Sage!

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:00.780 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:02.741 position:50% align:center
When you came to visit
us at the orphanage,

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:05.326 position:50% align:center
we thought you were just
a regular sorcerer.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.911 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:10.707 position:50% align:center
Well, revealing my true identity
tends to cause unwanted trouble.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
Of course! That makes sense.

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:16.087 position:50% align:center
So, Great Sage, why exactly
did you bring us here?

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
Just call me Dominix.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
There's someone here
I wanted you to see.

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Clause!

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:39.319 position:50% align:center
He has quite a few injuries,

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
but thankfully,
none of them are fatal.

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:44.532 position:50% align:center
In a little while,
he'll be back on his feet again.

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:46.034 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:48.078 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Yes, I'm so glad.

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
We detected Demonic
activities nearby,

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:53.917 position:50% align:center
so Cleo and I went down
to help out, but he...

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] He was the only
survivor we could find.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
Mr. Dominix, how did you know

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
that we were going
to search for Clause?

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:05.011 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX] Well, I was
watching you both from here.

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:06.554 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:08.765 position:50% align:center
Uh! He's waking up!

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
Kasel, you... and Frey...

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:23.822 position:50% align:center
I see. So Gran did make
it back to the kingdom.

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.741 position:50% align:center
Frey and I were so worried
we went searching for you.

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
[CLAUSE] You came out here
all by yourselves?

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.744 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
You two, always reckless.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:38.586 position:50% align:center
Those Demons came out of nowhere
and completely surrounded us.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
There was no way
for us to escape.

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center
There was a band of
dark elf mercenaries

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
that Orvelia sent to help
take out the Demons.

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:49.472 position:50% align:center
But that female Demon ran off.

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:51.266 position:50% align:center
Female Demon?

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:54.019 position:50% align:center
In other words, you
fought against a witch?

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.062 position:50% align:center
So you didn't see her at all?

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:57.605 position:50% align:center
[CLAUSE]
No, I didn't.

00:14:57.689 --> 00:15:00.483 position:50% align:center
All we fought were the Demons
that looked like skeletons.

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:03.695 position:50% align:center
Wait, so that woman we saw,

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
you don't think she's
related to the Demons

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.449 position:50% align:center
that attacked the scouts?

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:11.911 position:50% align:center
Nobody seems to know.
I guess she remains a mystery.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.791 position:50% align:center
Well, I think it's best
we let Clause rest some more.

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
The two of you should
also stay here

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:19.878 position:50% align:center
and rest for a little while.

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:21.087 position:50% align:center
Yes. Thank you.

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.923 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much
for all your help.

00:15:24.007 --> 00:15:27.385 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX] Cleo, Roi, would you
mind taking care of them?

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:29.346 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure.

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:33.725 position:50% align:center
Feel free to use this room,

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
and just let me know if you
need anything else, okay?

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
You're too kind.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry about it.

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:42.359 position:50% align:center
By the way, are you sure
you want your own room

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.694 position:50% align:center
instead of sharing
one with Kasel?

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
[gasps] But wait, Kasel
and I aren't like that!

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.699 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that so?

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
I thought you two looked
so good together.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.038 position:50% align:center
No, and please don't tease me.

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:56.706 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.500 position:50% align:center
I actually think
we're really similar,

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.335 position:50% align:center
so we should totally be friends.

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Huh?

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.214 position:50% align:center
You said you were raised
at an orphanage, right?

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
I don't have any parents either.
Dominix found me as a kid.

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.928 position:50% align:center
Oh, I understand.

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:14.683 position:50% align:center
But I really do enjoy life
here at the Tower of the Sage.

00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center
I've learned all sorts of
things while living here,

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
and I've gotten to train
to be a sorceress,

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
but sometimes...
it's a bit boring, you know?

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:36.079 position:50% align:center
The stars are lovely.

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:38.748 position:50% align:center
It may get boring
from time to time,

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
but the view of the
stars is the best!

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.130 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
Is that...?

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Right.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
I'll get out of your hair. Let
me know if you need anything!

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:55.223 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:10.572 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Kasel.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
What are you doing
out here so late?

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.077 position:50% align:center
Thinking.

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
If only... If only
I was stronger...

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.838 position:50% align:center
If I had the strength,
I might've been able

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
to help Clause and the
other Guardian Knights

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.009 position:50% align:center
fight those Demons.

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:35.096 position:50% align:center
Back then, when they
attacked my village...

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.975 position:50% align:center
...my mother died protecting me.

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:43.188 position:50% align:center
I don't want to lose
anyone else again.

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:46.900 position:50% align:center
I want to be able to protect
those precious to me.

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
But I--!

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:51.154 position:50% align:center
Oh, Kasel.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:56.326 position:50% align:center
I can't go on like this.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
I must become stronger.

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:05.251 position:50% align:center
[MORIHAM]
The Black Edge have returned.

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
We took care of the Demons,

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:10.465 position:50% align:center
and here's the proof of it.

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:12.550 position:50% align:center
He defiles the
palace once again!

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:14.761 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't bring
such things in here.

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
Uh! Put that away right now!

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
Now you must understand
what the Black Edge

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
are capable of doing for us.

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center
If we employ them, we won't
have to fear the Demons.

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:27.232 position:50% align:center
But these men are dark elves!

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
Is it really such
an issue to you

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:31.319 position:50% align:center
that these men are
of a different race?

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
[MENOS growls]

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:36.866 position:50% align:center
To destroy the Demons, all of us
must come together to fight.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.326 position:50% align:center
One hundred years ago,

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
King Kyle made allies with
the elves and the orcs.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
They worked together
to defeat the Dark Lord.

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
We are grateful for
your efforts today,

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
but get rid of that Demon head.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.342 position:50% align:center
It must not be seen
by the townsfolk.

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:58.596 position:50% align:center
[MORIHAM]
Hm.

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:01.599 position:50% align:center
[MORIHAM laughing]

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
Did you see the expressions
on their faces?

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
Just one look at
that Demon's head

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
and they all collapse
in utter fear.

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:14.154 position:50% align:center
Those men are such cowards,

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:16.614 position:50% align:center
and Orvelia is weakened
by their leadership.

00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:18.742 position:50% align:center
Behl may be a
diligent chancellor,

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center
but he is incapable
of ever taking action

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:22.954 position:50% align:center
when it's most needed.

00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:24.539 position:50% align:center
I, El Moriham,

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:28.251 position:50% align:center
am descended from a long line
of Orvelian Chancellors.

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
As such, it is my
familial destiny

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center
to ascend to the
rank of Chancellor.

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
We will silence those fools
and make them do our bidding,

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.846 position:50% align:center
but for that to happen,
you must deliver results to me.

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.515 position:50% align:center
Of course. I understand.

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:46.353 position:50% align:center
It was truly fortuitous that
you and I had met, Riheet.

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:50.899 position:50% align:center
If my plans work out, you will
all live a very good life.

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't be out of the
question for you, yourself,

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:55.278 position:50% align:center
to become a noble.

00:19:57.113 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
A toast to our future.

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:07.374 position:50% align:center
So, how are you feeling today?

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
I'm doing much better.

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:11.711 position:50% align:center
We have to go back to
Orvelia as soon as possible.

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
[CLAUSE groans]

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:14.506 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't push it.

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
Don't you think you should rest
for just a little bit longer?

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:20.679 position:50% align:center
We have no idea when the
Demons might strike again.

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:22.263 position:50% align:center
There's no way I can relax.

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:24.683 position:50% align:center
But, Clause--

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
I survived to have another
chance to defeat the Demons.

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:30.855 position:50% align:center
I will sacrifice my
life for Orvelia

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
and the friends
I lost in battle.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.819 position:50% align:center
You can't just--

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:38.446 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Um, hey, guys.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
Dominix wants to see you two.
He said it's very important.

00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.709 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
I brought them here.

00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:54.337 position:50% align:center
Thank you. You are
dismissed for now, Cleo.

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:56.798 position:50% align:center
'Kay...

00:20:56.881 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
[KASEL] So then, why did
you want to talk to us?

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:04.889 position:50% align:center
There's something important
that I must tell you.

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
Frey, I think you
should hear this, too.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:09.853 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Shh!

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.818 position:50% align:center
Your mother, Arlette,
do you recall her

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
ever telling you anything
about your father?

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
She didn't.

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:22.157 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
Is that so?

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.951 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess I did ask
her not to tell you

00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
until the appropriate time.

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:29.164 position:50% align:center
What do you mean appropriate?

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:32.709 position:50% align:center
You are the son of King Kyle,

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:38.298 position:50% align:center
who fought the Dark Lord
Angmund 100 years ago.

00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:40.091 position:50% align:center
And I am most certain
you will be able

00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:42.594 position:50% align:center
to wield the Holy Sword Aea.

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:45.972 position:50% align:center
How is that possible?
I can't be the son of King Kyle!

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
He lived 100 years ago.
Is this some kind of sick joke?

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:52.520 position:50% align:center
The Demons murdered my mother!

00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:54.606 position:50% align:center
Our village was attacked
when I was young!

00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:57.359 position:50% align:center
Why are you making
up these lies?

00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:02.364 position:50% align:center
I will explain everything.

00:22:02.447 --> 00:22:06.993 position:50% align:center
I will tell you what happened
when King Kyle was alive.

00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:12.082 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:23:47.135 --> 00:23:49.888 position:50% align:center
[FREY] Mr. Dominix tells
us about the past.

00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:52.640 position:50% align:center
How King Kyle defeated
the Dark Lord,

00:23:52.724 --> 00:23:55.393 position:50% align:center
and about the Holy Sword Aea.

00:23:55.477 --> 00:23:59.147 position:50% align:center
Now knowing the truth,
Kasel makes a choice.
