00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.110 position:50% align:center
[FREY] It's been a while
since we left you.

00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:52.112 position:50% align:center
I hope you're doing well.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:56.074 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I haven't had the
chance to write you until now.

00:01:56.157 --> 00:01:58.368 position:50% align:center
We finally arrived
at Ogria Mountain

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:02.288 position:50% align:center
and we're staying with the orcs.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:05.959 position:50% align:center
So many things have
happened since seeing you.

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:09.129 position:50% align:center
More than I can
put in this letter.

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:12.674 position:50% align:center
Kasel has grown a lot stronger

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:15.593 position:50% align:center
and is currently
engaged in a battle,

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:19.139 position:50% align:center
fighting against himself.

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:21.725 position:50% align:center
Back in Orvelia, I never
imagined things like this

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.728 position:50% align:center
could happen to us.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.939 position:50% align:center
But, Clause, I think
this might be the path

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:32.068 position:50% align:center
we were meant to
follow all along.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.654 position:50% align:center
Kasel was always destined
to become the heir

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:37.198 position:50% align:center
to the Holy Sword Aea.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.619 position:50% align:center
[FREY] After leaving you
at the Tower of the Sage,

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:45.999 position:50% align:center
we headed out to the Forest
of Elidora to meet the elves.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:51.254 position:50% align:center
That was... the first stop
on a very difficult journey.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.242 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
But seriously, who are you?

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:22.702 position:50% align:center
You didn't even
introduce yourself,

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:24.829 position:50% align:center
all you said was, "Follow me."

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:27.248 position:50% align:center
I thought that was kind
of rude, don't you?

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50% align:center
My name is Selene.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.169 position:50% align:center
I was given instructions
by Master Lorraine

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:34.130 position:50% align:center
to bring the human
boy, Kasel, to her.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
[NECHA]
Chibi.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.178 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Huh?

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:41.596 position:50% align:center
Where did she go?

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
She was just here a moment ago.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
C'mon, we better try
to catch up to her.

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
It's a dead end!

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.405 position:50% align:center
--[CLEO] Wait!
--[OTHERS] What?

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:01.449 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] By the way, did you
know the Forest of Elidora

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.993 position:50% align:center
has another name it
sometimes goes by?

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.036 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
No.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.496 position:50% align:center
The Forest of the Lost,

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
because the elves and treants
play tricks on travelers

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.001 position:50% align:center
to make them lose their way.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.545 position:50% align:center
Then why didn't you say sooner?

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
[NECHA]
Chibi.

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.047 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
[NECHA]
Chibi.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Uh...

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.180 position:50% align:center
[NECHA]
Chibi!

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
He seems very fond of you.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50% align:center
I think that, maybe,

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:37.944 position:50% align:center
Necha can sense something about
you and he sees you differently.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
And it's something that
only he is able to see,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
something that I am
incapable of seeing.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:54.419 position:50% align:center
Who are you?
Help me understand this.

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.553 position:50% align:center
I'm nobody important.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
I just want to protect
the people close to me,

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.894 position:50% align:center
but I don't have the
power to do so yet.

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.314 position:50% align:center
If I meet with Master Lorraine,

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
she can help me gain
the strength that I need.

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:24.949 position:50% align:center
No!

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50% align:center
This is bad.

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:28.536 position:50% align:center
[NECHA]
Chibi. Chibi!

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.163 position:50% align:center
Wait!

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
[NECHA]
Chibi!

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:41.633 position:50% align:center
[KASEL screaming]

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center
You Demon!

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center
Dammit! Dammit!

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:58.191 position:50% align:center
[SELENE]
No! Please stop it!

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:06.199 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
[SELENE]
Master Lorraine.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
You are the heir to
the Holy Sword Aea?

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:21.756 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I cannot
unseal it just yet.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
Please, I need to use
that power. I beg of you.

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center
The Holy Sword Aea
has so much power,

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:31.266 position:50% align:center
it is capable of defeating
the Dark Lord.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.310 position:50% align:center
But if the sword is
not wielded properly,

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.564 position:50% align:center
Kasel, it could destroy
not only your body

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
but your entire soul as well.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
That's fine. I don't care
about what happens to me.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.739 position:50% align:center
I need the power of the sword!

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
It's the only way I'll be able
to stop the Dark Lord!

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Chibi, I tried to protect you.

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.421 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:05.342 position:50% align:center
But instead, you saved my life.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.218 position:50% align:center
And I...

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:10.764 position:50% align:center
All I did was lose
myself to my anger.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:14.684 position:50% align:center
Even though we killed it,
that was dumb luck.

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.686 position:50% align:center
That's not the strength I need.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
I won't lose anyone, no more.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:25.695 position:50% align:center
I'll work to get stronger.

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:33.370 position:50% align:center
Before last night,

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
I truly believed all
humans were destroyers,

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:39.959 position:50% align:center
creatures that were a threat
to all of us here in the forest.

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:43.296 position:50% align:center
I thought humans were selfish
with no self-control.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.216 position:50% align:center
But then, Kasel and all of
his companions rushed in

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
to help the Forest of Elidora
fight against that plant Demon.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:53.056 position:50% align:center
They all acted selflessly.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
So then tell me, why didn't
you answer me last night?

00:07:58.103 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
[SELENE]
When he lost Necha,

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:03.692 position:50% align:center
it seemed he lost
control of himself.

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:06.861 position:50% align:center
At first, I thought if a human
like him gained power,

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:10.532 position:50% align:center
he might use it against the
Forest of Elidora for evil.

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:13.243 position:50% align:center
That was what I feared.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:16.579 position:50% align:center
But now, I realize
that he understood.

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:20.041 position:50% align:center
He understood that what he
felt then was not strength.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
What he seeks is true power.

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
Master Lorraine, I honestly
believe Kasel is worthy

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:30.051 position:50% align:center
of inheriting the power
of the Holy Sword Aea.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
And now, I will undo the seal
on the Holy Sword Aea.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:09:00.665 position:50% align:center
Yes, but there are two more
locks that still remain.

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
One of them is with Aeatola,

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center
the leader of the orcs
in Ogria Mountain.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:10.467 position:50% align:center
And the other is with Pavel
in Windland Snow Mountain,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
which is even further away
than Ogria Mountain.

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:18.350 position:50% align:center
You must visit both
of these mountains.

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
[FREY] Back then, I don't
think any of us understood

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
what it meant to gain the
power of the Holy Sword.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:31.696 position:50% align:center
We had no idea what
would happen to Kasel

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
once he unlocked this power.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
How is Kasel doing?

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
[FREY] His fever has gone down,
but he's still unconscious.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
I see, but Kaulah said he's just
needs to rest a bit to recover,

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center
so he'll be fine, right?

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Hm? Were you writing a letter?

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center
[FREY] Yes, I thought
I should let Clause know

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.971 position:50% align:center
how we've been doing.

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50% align:center
Oooh, that's such a great idea.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
I should write a letter to
Dominix to catch him up!

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
What should I tell him about?

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.564 position:50% align:center
I could say I'm
a genius sorceress

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:09.442 position:50% align:center
who beat up Demons
and saved that town!

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center
Or how I burned an evil
dragon to a crisp.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:15.198 position:50% align:center
A dragon? Have you
ever even seen one?

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.742 position:50% align:center
I do remember how you burned
down that inn's kitchen

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:19.703 position:50% align:center
that one time though.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:22.205 position:50% align:center
Well, dragon, kitchen,
they're practically the same!

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't lie
in your letter.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.584 position:50% align:center
Come on, I'm not lying.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:29.045 position:50% align:center
I'm just exaggerating
a little bit.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.672 position:50% align:center
A little?

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
Dear Master Dominix,
how have you been?

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.136 position:50% align:center
My journey with this
little gang of friends

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:38.596 position:50% align:center
has been going well so far!

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
[SELENE] Master Lorraine, the
Demons that entered the forest

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.565 position:50% align:center
have now been dealt with.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:52.485 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.
Your efforts are appreciated.

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:56.072 position:50% align:center
The Day of Lea, Goddess
of Darkness, approaches.

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:58.992 position:50% align:center
If the Dark Lord Angmund rises,

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
Demons will invade
every part of this world.

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
I have to wonder
how Kasel is doing.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.876 position:50% align:center
[LORRAINE] By now, he should
be past Ogria Mountain

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:10.837 position:50% align:center
and on his way to meet Pavel.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.173 position:50% align:center
I do hope he's all right.

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
I believe in him. I'm sure
they're all just fine.

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.096 position:50% align:center
[FREY] I've come to realize
on this trip that the world

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.891 position:50% align:center
is a lot bigger than I
originally thought it was.

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:25.977 position:50% align:center
There are so many places I
never thought I would see.

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:30.357 position:50% align:center
I would never have experienced
this if I stayed in Orvelia.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
But the Demons have been
invading everywhere.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
[CLEO grunts]

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
[FREY] Everyone is doing their
best to live their lives

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
in these trying times.

town full of travelers.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
Until one day we were all
plagued by a great war.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
There was so much
chaos and fighting.

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center

they all burned down.

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:06.017 position:50% align:center
My family was among those lost.

[FREY] In another village,
we met a young girl named Elise.

She was doing her best

[FREY]
Hello there.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
We met in the forest earlier.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.736 position:50% align:center
That girl's name is Elise.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.572 position:50% align:center
She doesn't talk to
us or smile ever.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.491 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:46.076 position:50% align:center
Are her parents here?

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.036 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
happened to them,

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:52.457 position:50% align:center
but they never made it to
the shelter, which means--

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.962 position:50% align:center
Let's draw some pictures
and hang them on the walls!

00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:01.633 position:50% align:center
A little decoration will really
brighten up this place.

that can be very hurtful.

for us to use the kitchen?

[WOMAN B] Oh? What do
you wanna use it for?

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.556 position:50% align:center

Amazing!

00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center
Elise, you can make
these again, right?

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:03.838 position:50% align:center
Now you have the recipe
to use later.

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:05.382 position:50% align:center
Yes.

what are the undead?

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:16.643 position:50% align:center
I think Johann said
that the villagers

killed in the Demon attack
returned as undead.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center

Is that even possible?

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:26.820 position:50% align:center
They're undead.
They're moving corpses.

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:29.197 position:50% align:center
They don't come back to life.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.241 position:50% align:center

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:34.494 position:50% align:center
In the records documenting
the battle 100 years ago,

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
the one that took place
on Galluah Plains,

00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:39.874 position:50% align:center
it is mentioned that the dead
rose up and fought again.

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.168 position:50% align:center
The text also said that
Demons are the ones

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.670 position:50% align:center

They often bring
messages as well.

Orc shamans are important
