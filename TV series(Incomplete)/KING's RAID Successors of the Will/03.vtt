[NARRATOR]
One hundred years have passed

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:16.474 position:50% align:center
since the Battle
of Galluah Plains,

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:19.853 position:50% align:center
where King Kyle defeated
the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center
The Demons rise again,
threatening peace,

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:26.401 position:50% align:center
spreading fear and unrest
throughout the land.

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:28.069 position:50% align:center
At the Tower of the Sage,

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:30.864 position:50% align:center
Kasel and Frey find
a wounded Clause

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:33.033 position:50% align:center
where the Great Sage
Dominix explains

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:36.953 position:50% align:center
that Kasel is the
son of King Kyle.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.833 position:50% align:center
I will explain everything.

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:46.671 position:50% align:center
I will tell you what happened
when King Kyle was alive.

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:35.613 position:50% align:center
[TAMM] Hey, I got some
food for all of us.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.782 position:50% align:center
Wow, nice, Tamm. Good work.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.409 position:50% align:center
Did you have any problems?

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.618 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Just a bit.

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:43.204 position:50% align:center
The shopkeeper gave me
a really weird look,

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:45.331 position:50% align:center
but the second I
mentioned Lord Moriham,

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.500 position:50% align:center
his attitude completely changed.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.586 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.629 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Here. For Azal and Zucca.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:52.714 position:50% align:center
[AZAL]
Thanks.

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:54.257 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Riheet, I'll put yours here.

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:55.216 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
Sure.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.010 position:50% align:center
--[TAMM] Ripine.
--[RIPINE gasps]

00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:00.638 position:50% align:center
You said you wanted to
try it fresh, right?

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:07.145 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Go ahead! Taste it!

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:15.445 position:50% align:center
That's bean bread. I personally
like it, how 'bout you?

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center
These Orvelian human foods
are way too salty for me.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center
Huh? I don't think
it's that bad.

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
A hundred years ago, when King
Kyle ruled over the kingdom,

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.960 position:50% align:center
dark elves were able to live
in the city, too, right?

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's Illya's fault.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center
Because of her,
we can't walk around here

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.259 position:50% align:center
without people lookin' at
us without fear or resent.

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:41.638 position:50% align:center
Don't bring her up.
Riheet will get angry.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.056 position:50% align:center
No, it's fine.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50% align:center
Yes, Illya is the reason
why dark elves

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
are persecuted in this city,

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
that's simply the
truth of the matter.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.314 position:50% align:center
[AZAL]
Yup! That's the truth!

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.737 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
One hundred years ago.

00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
Back then, King Kyle was
still just a prince.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
You've gotten better
at this--well done.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.604 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't deny
that it's all thanks

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.732 position:50% align:center
to your personal
training, Illya.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
Both of you are amazing.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.488 position:50% align:center
How about taking
a break with me?

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
Dominix, good to see you!

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.534 position:50% align:center
Same.

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
[ILLYA]
Delicious.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.165 position:50% align:center
The food in this town
is so good, isn't it?

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
Yeah.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
I've wanted to try their lunch
since the last time I saw it.

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Did you sneak out
and go into town again?

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I did.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.760 position:50% align:center
[ILLYA] How many times do I have
to tell you? Know your place!

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
[KYLE]
All right...

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX] King Kyle
was full of curiosity,

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:08.892 position:50% align:center
and always wanted to learn
about the lives of his people.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.935 position:50% align:center
His elder half-sister, Illya,

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center
always worried and
fussed over him,

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.357 position:50% align:center
but she loved him very much.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
I want to understand more
how the citizens here live.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.196 position:50% align:center
What do they experience
day to day in their lives?

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
What sort of food do they eat?

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
What are the things that bring
them joy and happiness?

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50% align:center
These are things you can't
see from the castle walls.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
You understand better
walking in the streets.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.126 position:50% align:center
Without citizens,
there's no nation.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
If we royals don't try
and understand our citizens

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.423 position:50% align:center
and just hoard our
wealth and power,

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.843 position:50% align:center
I fear Orvelia will
end up in ruins.

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:45.762 position:50% align:center
I wanna protect them.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:48.932 position:50% align:center
I wanna be a king who
can make his people happy.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
I know you will.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.353 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you will become
a splendid king.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.063 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Illya.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50% align:center
And one day,
when you become king,

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
I'll be sure to assist
you as much as I can

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:01.152 position:50% align:center
with my knowledge
of technomagic.

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:02.946 position:50% align:center
That makes me feel better.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.739 position:50% align:center
[KYLE, ILLYA chuckle]

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:10.620 position:50% align:center
So, Dominix, more recently,

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:13.540 position:50% align:center
Orvelia has experienced
peace and prosperity.

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.751 position:50% align:center
Why then do some of our
people suffer in poverty?

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
This is due to the war with
the neighboring nations.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately,
it's lasted too long.

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:27.137 position:50% align:center
War costs money and lives, and
poor families tend to suffer.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.141 position:50% align:center
Why did we even go to war?
It's meaningless.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:32.392 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
He wished to become a king

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center
who protects his people
and makes them happy.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:39.482 position:50% align:center
To achieve his goal,
King Kyle worked hard.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:43.236 position:50% align:center
He spent a great deal of
time training and studying.

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
King Kyle was young,

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50% align:center
and he was full of
dreams and hope.

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center
And the one person he chose

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50% align:center
to share his dreams
with was Arlette.

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.797 position:50% align:center
Wait, Arlette? You mean my--?

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:05.967 position:50% align:center
It's true. King Kyle was
in love with your mother.

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.719 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Huh?

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.433 position:50% align:center
But that's not possible!

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:16.936 position:50% align:center
How was Kasel's mother
alive 100 years ago?

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX] We will get
to that soon enough.

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:24.319 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
Back then,

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
Kyle and Arlette were
very happy together.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:32.577 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, it didn't
last very long.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
When they found out
that Kyle and Arlette

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.498 position:50% align:center
were romantically involved,

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:40.043 position:50% align:center
the king and the nobles
forced them to separate.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:44.297 position:50% align:center
Kyle was the successor
to the throne.

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.841 position:50% align:center
The king wanted Kyle to
marry for political reasons

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
and Arlette had
become an obstacle.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.180 position:50% align:center
However, his relationship
wasn't the only tragic struggle

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.265 position:50% align:center
that Kyle faced.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.976 position:50% align:center
Soon after, the Demons appeared.

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX] The Demons invaded
our world, attacking citizens,

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
destroying towns and villages.

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
King Kyle bravely led his army

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
and defeated the Demons
time and time again.

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:28.008 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX] And then, King Median,
Kyle's father, passed away.

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:31.678 position:50% align:center
So Kyle ascended to the
throne, becoming king.

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center
While the Demonic
invasion continues,

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
the situation is dire!

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
But now that I have become king,

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.995 position:50% align:center
I vow to defeat every
one of these Demons.

00:08:57.078 --> 00:09:01.041 position:50% align:center
As the king, I swear
to protect you all!

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:08.214 position:50% align:center
It's time to fulfill
my promise too then.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.175 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
The newly crowned King Kyle

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
did much to raise the
Orvelian army's morale.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.765 position:50% align:center
King Kyle met with many leaders.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:19.934 position:50% align:center
Lorraine of the elves
and Aeatola of the orcs.

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50% align:center
They entered into an alliance.

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
As a combined forced,

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:27.108 position:50% align:center
Kyle believed they could
defeat the Demons.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
Everyone accepted and
trusted King Kyle,

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
thanks to his wisdom
and his courage.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
But the Demons had an advantage
as their numbers were massive.

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
King Kyle was injured
during battle,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
and he found Arlette
at a shelter.

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
By that point... Arlette had you
growing inside of her, Kasel.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.886 position:50% align:center
King Kyle was more
than extremely pleased

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:58.640 position:50% align:center
to learn that he and Arlette
were expecting a child.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:04.479 position:50% align:center
If it is a boy,
we should name him Kasel.

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:07.774 position:50% align:center
I wanna make this world
a safer place for him.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
For our child soon to arrive.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.535 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
As if responding to his wish,

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
Lua, the Goddess of Light,
appeared to King Kyle.

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX] The Goddess gave
King Kyle the Holy Sword Aea...

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:38.138 position:50% align:center
...to save the world from
the Dark Lord, Angmund.

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50% align:center
[KYLE] I've received a message
from the Goddess of Light.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:53.653 position:50% align:center
When a red ring glows
around the moon,

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
the Dark Lord will appear to us,

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
threatening the peace
of this world.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
However, with the
Holy Sword Aea,

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.579 position:50% align:center
the Dark Lord can be destroyed.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:06.207 position:50% align:center
I ask you, everyone,
to please lend me your aid.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:10.628 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX] That day, we all swore
to fight by King Kyle's side.

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:13.506 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, Illya
had devoted herself

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
to the study of technomagic...

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.013 position:50% align:center
...without even thinking
about the consequences...

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.390 position:50% align:center
...or what it could lead to.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:30.899 position:50% align:center
Illya, her study of technomagic
eventually led to her

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:32.609 position:50% align:center
being put on trial
after her death,

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
and she was found guilty
in the end, right?

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:37.572 position:50% align:center
Yes, the priestess
taught me that story.

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:40.700 position:50% align:center
I believe she tried to build
another Holy Sword.

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
She did.

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center
Using her technomagic,

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:46.748 position:50% align:center
she attempted to create
a false Holy Sword.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:49.751 position:50% align:center
At the time, the people
of Orvelia believed

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:52.420 position:50% align:center
this was a blasphemous
act against Lua,

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:54.714 position:50% align:center
the Goddess of Light, herself.

00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:58.134 position:50% align:center
Why did she want to make
a false Holy Sword?

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center
Illya was trying to fulfill
her promise to Kyle.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
She wanted to help her brother

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center
by focusing on her own studies.

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:15.068 position:50% align:center
Finally, the fateful
day arrived.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:18.405 position:50% align:center
Do you know shining the red star

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
brighter than any
other in the sky?

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.409 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX] When that "nocturnal
sun" covers up the moon,

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.956 position:50% align:center
the moon glows a red color.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
On that day 100 years ago,
a sorcerer named Malduk,

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center
who served in the
Republic of Gray,

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:37.340 position:50% align:center
used ancient forbidden magic to
tear open a dimensional fissure,

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
in through which he brought
the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX] Along with his allies
and the Holy Sword Aea,

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:51.688 position:50% align:center
King Kyle set out to
defeat the Dark Lord.

00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
At the same time,

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center
Illya's research was
finally complete.

00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:00.071 position:50% align:center
She hurried after King Kyle,

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:04.284 position:50% align:center
but she was killed by Demons
on her way to see him.

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:08.163 position:50% align:center
She was unable to meet up
with her half-brother.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
With the help from his
companions and the Holy Sword,

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:14.794 position:50% align:center
King Kyle faced off
against Angmund.

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
However, after the
battle was over,

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
both King Kyle and
Angmund disappeared.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:27.265 position:50% align:center
The only thing that was left
was the Holy Sword Aea.

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:31.394 position:50% align:center
After that, Demonic
activities began to die down,

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:34.064 position:50% align:center
and peace returned to the world.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:41.112 position:50% align:center
But Malduk escaped, and no one
knows where King Kyle went.

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
So now you know the entire
story of your father.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
It sounds like King Kyle
was indeed a very brave man.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
He risked his life to
fight the Dark Lord.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.170 position:50% align:center
He worked hard
to protect everyone.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.588 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
If it wasn't for your father,

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:02.926 position:50% align:center
the world would have been
destroyed back then.

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
Once the battle was over,

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:08.056 position:50% align:center
Kyle's companions sealed
away the Holy Sword Aea.

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:11.893 position:50% align:center
They decided to each hold
one key to break the seal,

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
to ensure the seal
remains unbroken

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
until the day the
Dark Lord returns

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.900 position:50% align:center
and humanity needs
the sword again.

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
At the same time, Illya was
put on trial after her death

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:25.031 position:50% align:center
for the crime of
offending the Goddess Lua

00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
by trying to create
a false Holy Sword.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
She was found guilty.

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:33.415 position:50% align:center
From then on, Illya's family,
as well as all other dark elves,

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
were persecuted and
cast out of Orvelia.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Hey, Riheet.

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
Hm?

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
That story you told about Illya,

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
didn't she realize
that maybe her actions

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
would have brought trouble for
all dark elves in the future?

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
Why? What makes you ask that?

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking, maybe if
I could go back in time,

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
that would be the event
I would try and change.

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.065 position:50% align:center
[AZAL laughs]

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:01.609 position:50% align:center
C'mon, that's impossible!
Don't be an idiot!

00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:04.654 position:50% align:center
I was just trying to say,
what if I could do it?

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
I would go back and save

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.908 position:50% align:center
both of my parents
and my brothers, too.

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center
I wanna stop them from dying.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.746 position:50% align:center
But I would also wanna
go back 100 years

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
and give Illya a good
punch in her face!

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:18.626 position:50% align:center
I also agree with
punching Illya.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET] We can't go back in
time and Illya means nothing.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.804 position:50% align:center
What's important to remember
is after Illya's death,

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:32.807 position:50% align:center
dark elves were cast out
and persecuted in Orvelia,

00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:35.852 position:50% align:center
and much of our people's
blood was spilled.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
We will settle our
grievances with Orvelia.

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:51.659 position:50% align:center
Mr. Dominix, can you please
explain to me about my mother?

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
How it is possible for her
to live over 100 years?

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:58.917 position:50% align:center
Although your father left
behind the Holy Sword Aea,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
there was no one who
could wield it properly.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.547 position:50% align:center
We believed that only those
who carried King Kyle's blood

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:08.134 position:50% align:center
could inherit the ability
to use the sword.

00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:12.639 position:50% align:center
We also feared that Malduk
might bring back Angmund.

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
One hundred years later,
he could use the nocturnal sun

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
intersecting the moon to
bring back the Dark Lord.

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:21.690 position:50% align:center
If that happens,
we will need the aid

00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:24.192 position:50% align:center
of the Holy Sword and its heir.

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
Because of this, we decided to
put Arlette into a deep sleep.

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center
Wait, that means...

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.785 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
After almost 100 years,

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:37.914 position:50% align:center
Arlette woke up and
gave birth to you, Kasel.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.834 position:50% align:center
But shortly after,
Demons attacked your village,

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:44.504 position:50% align:center
and Arlette was
tragically killed.

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:47.799 position:50% align:center
With no parents and
no place to live,

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
it was me who decided to
send you to the orphanage.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.055 position:50% align:center
Then, it wasn't a
coincidence at all

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:58.059 position:50% align:center
that you visited us so much
at our orphanage, Mr. Dominix?

00:16:58.143 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
That's correct.

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
I have been making sure to
watch over your upbringing

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:03.106 position:50% align:center
this entire time.

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:07.652 position:50% align:center
I had to make sure to protect
the heir to the Holy Sword.

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:13.324 position:50% align:center
The nocturnal sun is on
the verge of intersecting

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
with the moon once again.

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:15.744 position:50% align:center
[KASEL gasps]

00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:18.079 position:50% align:center
[KASEL] So the Dark Lord
is coming back?

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
Even though King Kyle
defeated him?

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:21.750 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
Nobody knows how much damage

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:24.002 position:50% align:center
Kyle did to the Dark Lord.

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50% align:center
However, I believe that
the recent increase

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:28.923 position:50% align:center
in Demonic activity is a warning

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:33.011 position:50% align:center
or a sign of the
Dark Lord's return.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.101 position:50% align:center
Honestly, just being told
I'm the son of King Kyle

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:42.479 position:50% align:center
isn't really enough
to convince me.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.898 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe it's true.

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:55.658 position:50% align:center
[KASEL] But...
I want to become stronger.

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:59.329 position:50% align:center
If I had more power...
if I had the Holy Sword,

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:01.831 position:50% align:center
then I could finally
achieve my goal.

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:04.501 position:50% align:center
Please tell me, I beg of you!

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
You must tell me how to get
Holy Sword to protect everyone!

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
To acquire the Holy Sword,

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
you're going to have to
first break its seals.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.386 position:50% align:center
First you must go meet Lorraine,

00:18:14.469 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
the Grand Sage of the
Forest of Elidora.

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.724 position:50% align:center
Oh, Lorraine, one of
King Kyle's companions

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:21.559 position:50% align:center
from the battle
you spoke of, right?

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
If I could, I would
accompany the two of you,

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:29.192 position:50% align:center
but alas, I cannot leave
the Tower of the Sage.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
Cleo, Roi, you can
both come in now.

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:33.697 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.614 position:50% align:center
[CLEO sighs]

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:36.491 position:50% align:center
Why did you just close the door?

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.326 position:50% align:center
[CLEO grunts]

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.788 position:50% align:center
I-I wasn't eavesdropping
on your conversation.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
I just happened to
pass by the room.

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I swear
I wasn't listening!

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:50.338 position:50% align:center
I didn't hear anything
about the sword or Kyle!

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:54.217 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I did listen for a bit.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
There is no need to apologize.

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:59.222 position:50% align:center
I knew from the start that
you two were out there.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
You did?

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
What a creepy sage.

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX] These two will
accompany you instead.

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:05.603 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:11.526 position:50% align:center
Despite her carefree attitude,

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.987 position:50% align:center
Cleo here is a
talented sorceress.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.864 position:50% align:center
Roi has many useful skills, too.

00:19:15.947 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
They should help you
on your journey.

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:19.159 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Yay!

00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
Really? I actually get
to leave this place?

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:25.498 position:50% align:center
Can't you at least pretend
to be a little bit sad to leave?

00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
You really are too honest, Cleo.

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:31.546 position:50% align:center
[ROI] She's always talking about
how she wants to go outside.

00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
Now that I'm coming along,

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:39.637 position:50% align:center
you don't have to
be worried at all!

00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
I'll protect you both
from any danger!

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.518 position:50% align:center
Don't look at me--
I'm just her babysitter.

00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:48.563 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] You're my bodyguard,
Roi! Bodyguard!

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX] Cleo, Roi, please
support them on their journey.

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.444 position:50% align:center
They must unseal the Holy Sword.

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:55.528 position:50% align:center
[CLEO, ROI]
Yes.

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:56.571 position:50% align:center
And, Frey?

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.241 position:50% align:center
Do your best to
take care of Kasel.

00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:01.701 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:04.079 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIX]
Start your journey, Kasel.

00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
The only way to
protect this world

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:10.335 position:50% align:center
is by finding the Holy Sword Aea
and claiming it as the heir.

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Yes.

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:16.549 position:50% align:center
[CLAUSE]
You're King Kyle's son?

00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
I guess so, but it's really
hard to believe it

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
after just being told.

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
So that's why I have to go and
find out the truth for myself.

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:28.937 position:50% align:center
If it's true, I want to
find the Holy Sword Aea.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.313 position:50% align:center
If I can find it,

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:33.608 position:50% align:center
then I'm certain that
I can protect everyone!

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
Kasel, do you realize
how dangerous

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
this journey is going to be?

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:40.865 position:50% align:center
Yes, but this is something
that I really need to do.

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
I refuse to let anyone
else suffer again

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:46.079 position:50% align:center
just because the
Demons have returned.

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:57.090 position:50% align:center
I understand. You must go.

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:59.592 position:50% align:center
And don't you worry
about Orvelia, all right?

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:02.637 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure to defend our
home while you're both away.

00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:04.514 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
Frey, Kasel, promise to
come back in one piece.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.227 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.980 position:50% align:center
Of course. We promise.

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:18.611 position:50% align:center
[CLEO humming]

00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:21.906 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, so many places I
want to travel and visit!

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.117 position:50% align:center
And there is so much
food I've gotta try!

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.786 position:50% align:center
This isn't a sightseeing
trip, you know.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.039 position:50% align:center
Hey, I know that, Roi!

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm excited.
Let's do our best.

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:33.501 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:42.594 position:50% align:center
Right. Let's go.

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
This is it!

00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:14.876 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:49.179 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Our fate is set in motion.

00:23:49.262 --> 00:23:51.181 position:50% align:center
We arrived at the
Forest of Elidora

00:23:51.264 --> 00:23:54.267 position:50% align:center
in search of the Holy Sword Aea.

00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:58.521 position:50% align:center
However, the mysterious
forest seems to reject us,

00:23:58.605 --> 00:24:00.857 position:50% align:center
refusing to let us in.
