[NARRATOR]
One hundred years have passed

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.142 position:50% align:center
since the Battle
of Galluah Plains,

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:20.645 position:50% align:center
where King Kyle defeated
the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:23.815 position:50% align:center
The Demons rise again,
threatening the world,

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:26.568 position:50% align:center
spreading fear
and unrest to all.

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
The Black Edge are invited
to join the knights of Orvelia,

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.573 position:50% align:center
rising in the ranks.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:34.701 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, Malduk,
the sorcerer who summoned

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
the Dark Lord 100 years ago,
awakens from his slumber.

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:54.012 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK] Now, it's time for
the exciting banquet to begin!

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.365 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Cleo!

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.243 position:50% align:center
No, hang on. Cleo, wait!

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:43.038 position:50% align:center
So does this mean you're
actually on my side, Frey?

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:43.830 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Huh?

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:45.081 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:48.835 position:50% align:center
I told you already,
this is a serious bet.

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:50.253 position:50% align:center
Don't you feel sorry for me?

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.047 position:50% align:center
They're leaving me
out of this, Frey!

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50% align:center
There, there. Now calm down.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.633 position:50% align:center
Is that all you know how to say?

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:58.011 position:50% align:center
Always, "There, there"
and, "Calm down."

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.304 position:50% align:center
There, there-- Oh.

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:01.222 position:50% align:center
Cleo, stop being so selfish.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.724 position:50% align:center
Frey doesn't want
to be honest with you

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:05.143 position:50% align:center
because she doesn't
wanna hurt your feelings.

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:08.730 position:50% align:center
Hmph! Whatever!
Frey is just a goody two-shoes!

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.066 position:50% align:center
[FREY chuckles]

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.400 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.742 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait, it's just a kid.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:22.202 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.591 position:50% align:center
I guess there must
be a town nearby.

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
Might be a good idea to get
some water and food there.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:42.263 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about it,

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:45.475 position:50% align:center
you know what our quest party
kind of seems to be lacking?

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50% align:center
You know, a guide-type person--
like someone who knows the way.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.524 position:50% align:center
Wait, aren't you
two already our--?

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
What?

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
You realize that's supposed
to be our job, don't you?

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
Dominix wanted you to use
all the knowledge you have

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:00.990 position:50% align:center
from the Tower of the Sage.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.867 position:50% align:center
And what about you, Roi?

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
Well, I've... I've never
been to this area.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
But I've traveled around to
a lot of different places.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Oh, is that so?

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.921 position:50% align:center
[KASEL] You didn't know
that about Roi?

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center
Uh, nope. I never asked.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
[ROI] That's why you're really
easy to get along with.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Right?

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
That's the first time anyone
said something like that to me,

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.305 position:50% align:center
but that's always
what I've thought!

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.892 position:50% align:center
[KASEL] Well, it takes a minute
to get used to you, but sure!

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] Are you trying to
belittle Roi's compliment?

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
There, there.

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.238 position:50% align:center
Hey, is this the town?

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:43.116 position:50% align:center
[HENDEL]
Who are you?

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.163 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see! So all of you
are travelers then.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center
Y-Yeah.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50% align:center
My name is Hendel.
I'm the mayor.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
This building used to be the
assembly hall for this region,

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50% align:center
but now we have to
use it as our shelter.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:00.175 position:50% align:center
You're using it as a shelter?
What happened to you?

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:01.926 position:50% align:center
[HENDEL]
Our town is north of here.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.845 position:50% align:center
We were attacked by Demons.

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50% align:center
Everyone escaped to this
village, thankfully.

Ouch.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
Oh, I can help you.

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:18.818 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] Wow, the pain
is completely gone!

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center
Are you some sort of priestess?

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:21.821 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
Amazing! That's incredible!

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:26.993 position:50% align:center
Here, I can help.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.871 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, young man.

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
[HENDEL] Well, you see,
we're all working together

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
to build some new houses
for the refugees,

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.463 position:50% align:center
but we're severely
lacking in help.

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
We'd be happy to
assist your town.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center

also use our help.

Hello there, girls.

Can you do my hair next?

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.781 position:50% align:center

Hello there.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.291 position:50% align:center

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.719 position:50% align:center
That girl's name is Elise.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.513 position:50% align:center
She doesn't talk to us
or smile ever.

Oh, really?

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
Are her parents here?

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.019 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
happened to them.

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:38.440 position:50% align:center
But they never made it to
the shelter. Which means--

[FREY]
Elise.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.376 position:50% align:center

I know...

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
...that my magic can't heal
the troubles on your mind.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:06.384 position:50% align:center
I know it can't
reach your heart..

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:09.304 position:50% align:center
But just for now...

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
[KASEL] We should get ready
to move out soon.

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:17.645 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] I agree. We should go
say goodbye to the mayor.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.649 position:50% align:center
Sorry. But do you think we
could sleep here tonight?

Huh?

[CLEO]
Why?

We have to get the Holy

[FREY]
I know that, but...

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
Do you have a reason
you want to stay?

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
I know it's selfish,

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
but I really want to try
and help someone here.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.624 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.043 position:50% align:center
[ROI]
Hmm.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Well, if you're asking, Frey.

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center

Okay, then.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.382 position:50% align:center
Thank you all.

welcome to stay!

[FREY]
Mr. Mayor, um...

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.524 position:50% align:center
Would it be all right to spend
some time with the children?

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
Oh? Yes, of course, please do!

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.988 position:50% align:center
With all the building going on,
the adults don't have much time

to give to the
children these days.

Like this and this.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
And done! How's that?

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
Wow! It's so cute!

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:36.057 position:50% align:center
You can wear it or hang it
on a door in your house.

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.351 position:50% align:center
Oh, please teach us!

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50% align:center
Sure, why not? First go
find some flowers!

Wow. What'cha got there?
Those are so pretty!

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:52.407 position:50% align:center
But making a wreath with
those might be difficult.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.742 position:50% align:center
I have an idea!

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
Let's add these flowers to
the wreath as an accent.

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:07.881 position:50% align:center
Let's draw some pictures
and hang them on the walls.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:11.468 position:50% align:center
A little decoration will really
brighten up this place.

Elise, you can make
these again, right?

Now you have the

Yeah, sure.

Hey, listen up.
This is real big.

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:34.147 position:50% align:center
That's what I overheard him say.

Do you guys think
she would stay here

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center

Yeah, of course not.

There's just no way Frey would
ever abandon us like that.

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
Why are you worried about this?

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:51.748 position:50% align:center
I'm saying, if Frey stays
behind, it would be chaos.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:54.542 position:50% align:center
You know, the only reason our
group hasn't fallen apart yet

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:55.835 position:50% align:center
is because Frey is the one

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
who keeps the peace
between all of us.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:01.758 position:50% align:center
Heh. It's funny you of
all people think that.

You're the cause of most
of the problems, Cleo.

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
Take today for example.

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
You called her a goody

Uh, that's-- Well, that's not...

And anyway, Frey is our
very dear friend.

[FREY] In a town that
was attacked by Demons,

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.848 position:50% align:center
we encounter an
unexpected enemy.

00:23:51.931 --> 00:23:53.850 position:50% align:center
We wonder, what are
the intentions

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:56.644 position:50% align:center
of the last man
remaining in the town?

Can the cries of this survivor
reach his loved ones?
