One hundred years have passed

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
since the Battle
of Galluah Plains,

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.978 position:50% align:center
where King Kyle defeated
the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:23.273 position:50% align:center
The Demons rise again,
threatening the world,

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.651 position:50% align:center
spreading fear
and unrest to all.

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
After saving the
Forest of Elidora,

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.698 position:50% align:center
Kasel's determination
convinces Lorraine

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
to remove her seal
on the Holy Sword Aea.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.830 position:50% align:center
He continues on his journey
to get the next seal removed

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
by Orc Chieftain Aeatola.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
The Holy Sword is Lua's curse.

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:52.969 position:50% align:center
Will you become Lua's puppet
just like King Kyle had?

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.485 position:50% align:center
[FREY] It seems like we still
have a long way to go.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.030 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I didn't expect meeting
with the orc chieftain

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.866 position:50% align:center
to be an easy task for us.

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.242 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
We just have to keep pushing on

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.494 position:50% align:center
towards Ogria Mountain.

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:42.704 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
I agree.

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:45.123 position:50% align:center
At least we're getting
closer to another town.

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:47.292 position:50% align:center
It's famous for many
sightseeing spots

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.919 position:50% align:center
and delicious signature food!

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:54.174 position:50% align:center
Omelets, sausages, and
some spiders for Kasel!

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:57.427 position:50% align:center
If they've got spiders,
count me in!

Come on, Cleo.

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.060 position:50% align:center
You have to stop treating
this like a sightseeing trip.

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:08.146 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] That's not fair.
We've been walking for days!

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.857 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to
cheer everyone up!

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.485 position:50% align:center
And look! We're almost
there! Let's hurry!

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.653 position:50% align:center
[CLEO chuckles]

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
I've heard a lot
about this town.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.368 position:50% align:center
I've wanted to visit it
for a long time.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
I can't wait!

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.876 position:50% align:center
There are so many
people in this town!

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Hey, guys! Come over here!

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Whoa!

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:40.095 position:50% align:center
I hope we have enough
money for this.

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:44.349 position:50% align:center
Hi, sir! Give me everything
you have laid out here.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.786 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Eat up. You need energy!

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50% align:center
Kasel, you can have
some of my extras.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.962 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
What? Are you sure? Thanks!

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
You're welcome. I think
you need it more.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.299 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
There's supposed to be a great

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:21.219 position:50% align:center
sightseeing spot over there
called the Fountain of Krall.

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50% align:center
We can stop by it, right?

00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:25.682 position:50% align:center
[KASEL] No, I don't think
we have time for that.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.142 position:50% align:center
We have to hurry onward.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Come on, just for a little bit?

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
No means no.

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center
Thirty years ago,
this town was engulfed in war,

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
and thanks to the fighting,

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:38.194 position:50% align:center
it was on the verge
of being destroyed.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
According to a book I read,

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.825 position:50% align:center
the surviving residents
held their heads high

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
and worked together
to rebuild the town,

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:49.414 position:50% align:center
making it a tourist center
for lots of visitors!

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:53.001 position:50% align:center
Isn't that wonderful?
We should support them!

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.462 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess that we could--

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Then let's all go sightseeing!

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.800 position:50% align:center
Wait, hold on. Uh...

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
If we continue on
through this town,

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
we'll have to sleep outside
tonight, won't we?

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:06.806 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's true,

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.100 position:50% align:center
and we've had to camp
outside every night.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
It would be beneficial
to find a nice inn

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.896 position:50% align:center
and get a good night's sleep.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.397 position:50% align:center
I guess it might make sense

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
for us to spend the day in
the town, at least this time.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.610 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:21.988 position:50% align:center
Since we're all here,
we should enjoy ourselves!

[ROI]
Cleo, what did you do?

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
This might be all the money
that we have left now. Oopsies.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry!

No, I am. I should've been
more strict as your babysitter.

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:04.072 position:50% align:center
The money is gone,
so let's not dwell.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:05.824 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll go camping then!

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:08.702 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
What?! No way we're doing that!

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.996 position:50% align:center
I wanted to sleep in a
nice fluffy bed tonight!

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't complain,

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Now, hold on!

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.667 position:50% align:center
In a town like this,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.211 position:50% align:center
there's gotta be plenty
of ways to make money.

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:21.881 position:50% align:center
You wait here, and I'll
go find work for us!

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
Find us work?

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] This place will pay us,
and on top of that,

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:32.559 position:50% align:center
they're going to let us stay
in an empty room, too!

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
I'll be helping out
in the kitchen!

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center

waiter for the guests then.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center

some delicious tea

Cleo seems very
depressed about this.

Well, I don't think I've ever
seen her be the quiet before.

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center

and I had the chance.

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Maybe.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:57.240 position:50% align:center
But I think, if you keep
practicing your magic more,

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:58.992 position:50% align:center
eventually, you'll
soon understand

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
what your mother meant.

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:02.704 position:50% align:center
Do you think so?

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:05.290 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do, because I think
you're still connected

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
to your mother
through your magic.

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] Connected? Yeah,
you might be right.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:21.765 position:50% align:center

Sleep well, Cleo.

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Kasel, wake up!

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:32.859 position:50% align:center
Hang on, where did Roi go?

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.278 position:50% align:center
Look at this note.

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:38.114 position:50% align:center
[KASEL] "Went to go make
some money, Roi."

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
Cleo's missing, too.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:40.825 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Hey, guys!

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.497 position:50% align:center
I found some more work!

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.582 position:50% align:center
It's at a restaurant in
the outskirts of town

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:48.958 position:50% align:center
called Madam Volf's.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center
Uh? Hold on, where's Roi?

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:58.677 position:50% align:center
I see. Nowhere to be found then.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.681 position:50% align:center
It's in the past,
Roi. Just let it go.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% align:center
[ROI]
I need to sell this off.

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.690 position:50% align:center
[FREY] Are you sure there's
really a restaurant

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50% align:center
this far outside of town?

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center
All I see here is
a lot of nothing.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.156 position:50% align:center
What are these big rocks
lying around for?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey! Look there!

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.082 position:50% align:center
Huh? You wanna work for me?

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.002 position:50% align:center
Yes, we do.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
All right, then.
Well, get to work.

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
There's plenty to do here.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Y-Yes.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.134 position:50% align:center
[KASEL sighs]

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:51.021 position:50% align:center
This won't be easy, will it?

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.231 position:50% align:center
It looks like we've
got a lot work to do,

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
but I'm a little excited.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.944 position:50% align:center
Right, I'll do my best!

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:04.242 position:50% align:center
You haven't fixed that?
You going to take all day?

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
Hurry, slowpoke.
Pick up the pace!

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:10.040 position:50% align:center
[CLEO grunting]

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.499 position:50% align:center
Fine.

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.961 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
All right!

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
Ah, so you're a sorceress?

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.384 position:50% align:center
Yes, I am!

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:23.928 position:50% align:center
So that means you can work
a thousand times faster

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:25.555 position:50% align:center
than you're doing.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.223 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:32.020 position:50% align:center
Dust off the lamps!
Hurry and fix the roof!

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:33.688 position:50% align:center
Scrub the floors!

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] What does this have
to do with my magic?

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.321 position:50% align:center
Come on... don't you
think you might be

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:44.240 position:50% align:center
overworking me just
a little, old lady?

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:45.742 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
"Old lady"?

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:49.329 position:50% align:center
That's no way to
talk to an elder!

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:54.501 position:50% align:center
You should address me properly!
Call me Madam Volf, little girl!

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:57.921 position:50% align:center
I'm not a little girl!
My name is Cleo, okay?

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:01.049 position:50% align:center
I'll call you whatever.
Get back to work, little girl!

00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:03.134 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
I told you, my name's Cleo!

00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:05.970 position:50% align:center
Fine, whatever! I'll get
to work, Madam Wolf!

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.889 position:50% align:center
Oops! I mean, Madam Volf.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
You misspoke on purpose!

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.851 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Why would I misspeak?

00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
Just because you've been howling
at me all day to do your work?

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:17.565 position:50% align:center
How could I possibly
mistake you for a wolf?

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:19.150 position:50% align:center
[MADAM growls]

00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
Fine then, I know what job will
get you to shut your loud mouth!

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Bring it on!

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:28.410 position:50% align:center
[CLEO coughing]

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:33.581 position:50% align:center
That annoying Madam.

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50% align:center
[MADAM] I don't hear you running
your mouth off anymore.

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.295 position:50% align:center
[MADAM laughs]

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:41.297 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Cleo may have an attitude,

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
but I think Madam's
is even worse.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.510 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'm watching
two kids fight.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:46.594 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
All right, Madam!

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.430 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever
you throw at me!

00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
What else do you need
done in this dump?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.101 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
Wipe down the windows!

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
Hmm...

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:09.117 position:50% align:center
All right. The restaurant is
clean... but <i>you</i> are filthy.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.077 position:50% align:center
Go get cleaned up!

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:20.086 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
You all must be hungry.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.212 position:50% align:center
Well, eat up.

00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:23.381 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:27.719 position:50% align:center
It's so good!

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:32.474 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:36.519 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
I haven't cooked in a long time.

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.855 position:50% align:center
Because this place is on
the outskirts of town,

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.940 position:50% align:center
I rarely get customers.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
That's such a shame.

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:44.861 position:50% align:center
Then why don't you try
advertising this place?

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:45.987 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
It's fine.

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:48.323 position:50% align:center
I do all my cooking
over charcoal,

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:51.409 position:50% align:center
so I can't cook too
much at one time.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
If I use my fire magic,
I could help you cook more.

00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:02.754 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:04.547 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
Fire magic?

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
Please, no.
Anything but fire magic.

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:14.224 position:50% align:center
[MADAM] I see, so you're a
fire magic sorceress, are you?

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:17.060 position:50% align:center
However, you can't use
that type of magic here.

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
But why not?

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.730 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
I know this might just look like

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
bare land to you right now,

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
but it used to be a whole
town, full of travelers.

00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:30.073 position:50% align:center
Till one day we were all
plagued by a great war.

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
There was so much
chaos and fighting.

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:36.413 position:50% align:center
People, houses,
they all burned down.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center
My family was among those lost.

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:44.254 position:50% align:center
This restaurant and I were the
only things that remained here.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center
All those rocks scattered about

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:49.384 position:50% align:center
are makeshift
gravestones I made.

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:51.386 position:50% align:center
With so many people dead,

00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:54.597 position:50% align:center
I couldn't make proper
gravesites for them.

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:56.433 position:50% align:center
We had no idea.

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:58.977 position:50% align:center
I can't believe this place
used to be a town.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.478 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
I know better than anyone

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
how terrifying
fire can be.

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
So I ask that magic
not be used.

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:07.402 position:50% align:center
But, Madam, I don't
think you understand.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.654 position:50% align:center
My magic is supposed
to help people.

00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:12.449 position:50% align:center
It's not for burning buildings
or bad things like that.

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
There was a sorcerer back then,

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:17.328 position:50% align:center
and they also tried
to protect us.

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:21.458 position:50% align:center
However, instead, all they
did was cause great tragedy.

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
The only fire you can
use here is charcoal.

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] I never realized...
with a small mistake,

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
my magic could hurt
people terribly.

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
[CLEO'S MOTHER]
The stronger you become,

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
the more sadness there will be.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:49.569 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] Maybe this is what my
mother was trying to tell me.

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:51.696 position:50% align:center

00:17:58.328 --> 00:17:59.704 position:50% align:center

Oh, no!

Damn Demons!
Protect Madam Volf!

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:08.338 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:31.528 position:50% align:center
[KASEL] We need to stop them
from getting to the restaurant!

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:32.779 position:50% align:center
Got it! Right!

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:34.531 position:50% align:center

Oh, no.

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:36.324 position:50% align:center

No, we won't let you get hurt.

Oh, but--

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:55.885 position:50% align:center
Hurry up!

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:07.230 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

Cleo, use your magic!

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center
But she said--!

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
She said I can't use
my fire magic here!

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
No. What have I done?

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
Because of me, she won't...

[gasps] Madam, I'm so...

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
You put your life on the
line to save your friends.

00:20:58.216 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center
Madam!

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
[CLEO giggles]

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
[MADAM chuckles]

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:11.271 position:50% align:center
[MADAM] Oh? You're a bit
thicker than I realized.

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:12.897 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Hm?

00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:14.733 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:15.984 position:50% align:center
Madam!

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
[BOTH chuckle]

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:19.404 position:50% align:center
[ROI]
There you all are.

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:20.363 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Roi!

00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:21.906 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Where have you been?

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.868 position:50% align:center
Roi! Where the heck
were you? You missed it!

00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:28.121 position:50% align:center
We just had a life-or-death
fight against the Demons!

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:29.664 position:50% align:center
Demons?

00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:32.042 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. Good job then.

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:34.252 position:50% align:center
You could care a
little more, you know!

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:35.545 position:50% align:center
[ROI]
Calm down.

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:37.922 position:50% align:center
Look, I made us some more money.

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:39.257 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:42.385 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'll take good care
of it this time. Huh?

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:44.804 position:50% align:center
I'll manage our
money from now on.

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:45.972 position:50% align:center
That's smart.

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:47.891 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Okay...

00:21:57.776 --> 00:22:02.113 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] I think I understand
just a little bit better now.

00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:05.408 position:50% align:center
What it means to be a sorceress.

00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:10.163 position:50% align:center
I can't defend anyone if
I don't put my all into it!

00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:13.792 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] Right. Let's make
this a great day!

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.054 position:50% align:center
[FREY] While we
continue our travels,

00:23:49.137 --> 00:23:51.890 position:50% align:center
the Black Edge defend
Orvelia from Demons

00:23:51.973 --> 00:23:55.518 position:50% align:center
and have gained the support of
many within the castle walls.

00:23:55.602 --> 00:23:59.898 position:50% align:center
However, not everyone is happy
about their presence there.
