[yells]

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.902 position:50% align:center
Are you only planning
on attacking me head on?

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:16.196 position:50% align:center
If that's so...

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.616 position:50% align:center
...you'll never become a
full-fledged knight, Kasel.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.911 position:50% align:center
I'm not just trying to become
a full-fledged knight!

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:25.163 position:50% align:center
I want to be a knight
who protects everyone!

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:26.498 position:50% align:center
[FLEGG]
Not this again.

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.458 position:50% align:center
[CLAUSE]
Talking a big game, are we?

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.503 position:50% align:center
All right then, you should
have no problem beating me!

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.672 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.010 position:50% align:center
[CLAUSE]
You're too headstrong, Kasel.

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:42.430 position:50% align:center
If you keep charging right in,
it could cost you in the end.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:43.848 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Dammit!

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center
I'm always one level above you.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center
You've got a long way to go
before you can beat me.

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:55.902 position:50% align:center
It's only because
you're taller than me!

00:03:55.985 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center
I'm going to surpass
you someday soon!

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:02.409 position:50% align:center
[KASEL yells]

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
Just watch!

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
[KASEL groans]

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.963 position:50% align:center
All right, it's time for
work now, apprentice.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:18.383 position:50% align:center
Gran, Flegg, you two
should get to work as well!

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
[GRAN]
Yeah, I know.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.680 position:50% align:center
Well, seems Clause won again.

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
See, I told you it wouldn't
be that easy to beat him.

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
And if I recall the bet,

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
you owe me for lunch
today, Flegg. Pay up.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:33.606 position:50% align:center
Come on, you need to hurry up
and get stronger, Kasel.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center
After all, my lunch
is at stake, you know.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
Why is that my problem?

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.821 position:50% align:center
You're an honest
and hard worker,

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:41.531 position:50% align:center
I guess we can give you that.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:42.574 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Huh?

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
But you should practice
your technique

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
and try to build up
some more stamina.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
[GRAN] Well... you're not bad,
as far as apprentices go.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm pretty sure you'll
find you'll get stronger soon,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center
since Clause is training
you every day.

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center
Great, so both our lunches are
gonna be on you today, okay?

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center
Right, buddy?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why do I have to buy lunch?
That doesn't make any sense!

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.308 position:50% align:center
[FLEGG yawns]

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.101 position:50% align:center
Man, am I bored!

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:11.895 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you sure you
should be saying that

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
while we're on patrol?

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's a good thing.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.066 position:50% align:center
If we're bored on patrol,

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.360 position:50% align:center
then that means it's
peaceful right now.

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
Ah! How joyful to bored!

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.490 position:50% align:center
Well, then maybe don't
say it so loudly.

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.659 position:50% align:center
I'll have to take a trip to
May's place later today

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.245 position:50% align:center
just to make sure nothin'
happened while I was away.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:30.705 position:50% align:center
[TOWNFOLK A]
Hey, is that--?

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:34.084 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
[TOWNFOLK B]
A dark elf.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
[TOWNFOLK D] What's a dark
elf doing in Orvelia?

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:46.680 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:53.561 position:50% align:center
Well, that was unsettling.

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center
Yes. What could he
possibly want?

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.858 position:50% align:center
The two of you are guardian
knights, aren't you?

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
So why don't you throw
them out of here?

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:04.864 position:50% align:center
Huh? But he hasn't done anything
wrong or broken any laws.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:06.533 position:50% align:center
[MAN C]
Who cares? It's a dark elf!

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
There's no way he's here
for a good reason!

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.872 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and dark elves are the
very embodiment of bad omens.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
[TOWNSPEOPLE murmuring]

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
Now, hold on,
everyone, calm down!

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure my superiors hear
about this as soon as possible.

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:25.802 position:50% align:center
You can go on and head back.
It's your break now, isn't it?

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
[FLEGG]
No need to worry.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center
The Guardian Knights will
protect the peace in this town.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.731 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
That looks delicious.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:38.982 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.192 position:50% align:center
Yes, this batch here
is very fresh!

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
For an adorable
priestess like you,

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
I'll even toss in
another one for free.

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Oh? Are you sure?

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
Of course! Take an extra!

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.785 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Thank you very much.

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:53.163 position:50% align:center
May the holy light protect you.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.622 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Frey!

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
Kasel.

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad I ran into you.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.090 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen you
in quite a while,

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
so I was wondering
how you were doing.

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:10.347 position:50% align:center
You really don't have
to worry about me.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50% align:center
I've been doing just fine,

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
and besides, Clause is
with me, you know.

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
That's good to hear.

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:19.064 position:50% align:center
Since you're always eating
such weird things, Kasel,

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
I was worried that you'd
upset your stomach again.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
Tell me, when have I ever
eaten anything weird?

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
You always do. Like
centipedes and spiders.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.491 position:50% align:center
There's nothing weird
about eating that.

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
No, it is weird.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.579 position:50% align:center
[FREY] Do you remember
when we were younger,

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:38.416 position:50% align:center
and you, me, and Clause would go
insect hunting until sundown?

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.543 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we completely
lost track of time

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.962 position:50% align:center
and got dragged straight
back to the orphanage.

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.964 position:50% align:center
The priest was so
angry at all of us

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
that both Clause
and I started crying,

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
but you fell asleep,
tired from the day.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:51.763 position:50% align:center
Fell asleep?

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.098 position:50% align:center
You did!

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.766 position:50% align:center
Clause was surprised that
you could sleep through

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.768 position:50% align:center
all of us getting yelled at.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:04.150 position:50% align:center
You're working hard to
become a knight. I'm glad.

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I'm still stuck at
the apprentice level, though.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.617 position:50% align:center
See, earlier today...

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:17.455 position:50% align:center
...there was a little incident
that happened in town,

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:20.208 position:50% align:center
but I couldn't do
anything about it.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.504 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll finish your
apprenticeship very soon

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.965 position:50% align:center
and look really cool!

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50% align:center
I wanna be a knight
that can protect everyone.

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.429 position:50% align:center
That's my goal.
Nothing else matters to me!

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:35.932 position:50% align:center
[FREY] You really haven't
changed, have you?

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.399 position:50% align:center
[CHAMBERLAIN]
Please, you may enter.

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:52.073 position:50% align:center
[BEHL]
My king, I have some news.

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Behl. What is it?

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.246 position:50% align:center
Our recent scouts have sent
word to us of Demon sightings

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
within the King's Forest.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
They saw them?

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:05.170 position:50% align:center
[BEHL] Yes, sire. We will send
out knights immediately.

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:09.049 position:50% align:center
We must not allow a single
Demon to enter Orvelia.

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:11.134 position:50% align:center
[BEHL]
Yes. I understand.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center
A century ago, we were
ready, but now, if they...

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:19.809 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
Sire.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:26.941 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:28.777 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A]
Lord Moriham?

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.153 position:50% align:center
Is this one with you?

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
[MORIHAM] Yes, he's with me.
Let us through.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.324 position:50% align:center
That's a dark elf.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:35.408 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center
[MORIHAM]
What are you waiting for?

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:37.243 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
[BOTH
Yes, sir!

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:42.665 position:50% align:center
Although you'll have to
turn in your weapon.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.460 position:50% align:center
Naturally.

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:48.213 position:50% align:center
[SCHMIDT] There were demons
spotted in the King's Forest.

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
Could this mean the Dark
Lord's armies are in Orvelia?

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
[MENOS] I thought King Kyle
destroyed the Dark Lord

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center
100 years ago in the
Battle of Galluah Plains.

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:58.932 position:50% align:center
This is impossible!

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.351 position:50% align:center
[WETTER] Even if it's not
the actual Dark Legion,

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
we have no idea how many
Demons there are in the forest.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.232 position:50% align:center
We cannot gauge just
how many men we need

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:09.609 position:50% align:center
to investigate the
situation out there.

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
I believe we limit the
sacrifice to a minimum.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.157 position:50% align:center
Send a small group of knights to
investigate the forest for now.

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
But if none return
to give a report,

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50% align:center
that would be
completely useless!

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
[MORIHAM] Greetings and
salutations, everyone.

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:26.334 position:50% align:center
Lord Moriham. Who is this?

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:29.796 position:50% align:center
This man is one of my
soldiers, Sir Chancellor.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
Huh? But he's a dark elf!

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:34.801 position:50% align:center
How dare you let this
one into the castle!

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
This is a grave insult,
Lord Moriham!

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:41.224 position:50% align:center
As far as I recall, there is
no law barring dark elves

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.309 position:50% align:center
from entering the castle.

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center
Am I mistaken?

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center
Or did someone commit the
unspeakable act of making rules

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:50.650 position:50% align:center
without the king's consent?

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center
[WETTER, MENOS grumble]

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
[BEHL] So why exactly did you
bring him here to the castle?

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
I heard you're planning to
send scouts to investigate.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center
These men are
called the Black Edge

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50% align:center
and should be very useful to us.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.581 position:50% align:center
What is the Black Edge?

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center
They are a band of
fierce mercenaries

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
who have been growing in fame.

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center
This man is Riheet, and as
the leader of the Black Edge,

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.924 position:50% align:center
he can take on 100 men alone.

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
[NOBLES]
What?

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
I must ask you.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:21.973 position:50% align:center
The animosity between Orvelia
and dark elves runs deep,

00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
so then why are you
choosing to assist us now?

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.520 position:50% align:center
We are simply men for hire.

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:31.232 position:50% align:center
And I have no interest
or care in who hires me.

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:35.278 position:50% align:center
Oh? And what do you ask
in return for your assistance?

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center
Nothing.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:39.407 position:50% align:center
As long as you pay us,
I'll ask for nothing else.

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.409 position:50% align:center
They are quite straightforward.

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
And this is why I consider
them so trustworthy.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
So different from those who
claim to work for the nation,

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
yet concentrate on political
and financial gains

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.336 position:50% align:center
that benefit only them.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.296 position:50% align:center
[MENOS growls]

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.714 position:50% align:center
Chancellor, sir,

00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:57.926 position:50% align:center
I ask you to please make
full use of the Black Edge.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.969 position:50% align:center
We cannot let these
suspicious strangers

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.971 position:50% align:center
take on such an
important mission.

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
We do not need these
dark elves to assist us

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
with Orvelia's defense!

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
I also disapprove!

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:09.604 position:50% align:center
They are all correct.

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
We will be the ones to defend
our nation ourselves.

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.528 position:50% align:center
As you wish, Chancellor.

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
You have my sincere apologies

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.866 position:50% align:center
for speaking out of line
about the situation.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
Ugh.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.419 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait a sec, you're actually
gonna eat that thing.

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to get heartburn
just from looking at it.

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
Whole-cooked spider
is actually really delicious.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.259 position:50% align:center
[GRAN, FLEGG]
Ugh.

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center
[CLAUSE] Kasel eats
everything and anything.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
If nothing else,
his stomach is strong.

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Heh. That's true.

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:49.269 position:50% align:center
Oh! By the way,
I saw Frey earlier.

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:50.478 position:50% align:center
[CLAUSE]
Frey?

00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I bumped into her
at the marketplace.

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:54.107 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't believe
how priestly

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.026 position:50% align:center
she's gotten these days!

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:57.277 position:50% align:center
[FLEGG]
Ugh.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.697 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm glad to hear
she's working hard then.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.781 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Yeah.

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:03.283 position:50% align:center
You've become
a full-fledged knight

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.243 position:50% align:center
and Frey has become a priestess.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.912 position:50% align:center
Look at you both making
your dreams come true.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.372 position:50% align:center
You know,

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
you'll be finished with your
apprenticeship in no time.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.919 position:50% align:center
[KASEL] But you always say I
still have a long way to go.

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:18.006 position:50% align:center
I've decided to give you
some positive reinforcement.

00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:20.133 position:50% align:center
You better be more
appreciative, Kasel.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Clause's training is
normally very unforgiving.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.931 position:50% align:center
That feels like
an understatement.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:28.683 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'll be going off

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:31.519 position:50% align:center
on a new mission
tomorrow morning,

00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:33.772 position:50% align:center
so I won't be
training you for a while.

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:34.856 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.608 position:50% align:center
We got word that
Demons were spotted

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
inside the King's Forest.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:44.657 position:50% align:center
[CLAUSE] Our squad is
being sent to investigate.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:46.910 position:50% align:center
Gran and Flegg are going, too.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.703 position:50% align:center
Make sure to keep up
with your training--

00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:50.789 position:50% align:center
no slacking off while
we're gone, all right?

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:54.042 position:50% align:center
Should we get some
spiders as a souvenir?

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:55.126 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.587 position:50% align:center
There's no need to
be worried, Kasel.

00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.130 position:50% align:center
This sort of thing
is what we knights

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:01.299 position:50% align:center
have trained for after all.

00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:02.175 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
All right, now eat up!

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
Besides, you're the one
who's buyin' tonight.

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:09.140 position:50% align:center
Why am I always buying?

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:12.185 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Ah! Someone help me!

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.453 position:50% align:center
[DARK ELVES laughing]

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center
Sneaking into here
was way too easy.

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:35.375 position:50% align:center
I'm glad that it
seemed to go well.

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:36.459 position:50% align:center
[AZAL]
Yeah.

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:38.253 position:50% align:center
So you really had
no trouble at all

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:40.296 position:50% align:center
gettin' inside that
castle, Riheet?

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.215 position:50% align:center
Yes, it was easy.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.259 position:50% align:center
So when are we gonna
do this thing already?

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:47.345 position:50% align:center
We're gonna kill all those
lousy, rotten nobles, aren't we?

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.389 position:50% align:center
You idiot, use your
brain for once.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:50.390 position:50% align:center
But Tamm is right.

00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:52.267 position:50% align:center
If we're going to do it,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.686 position:50% align:center
all of us are prepared
and ready on your order!

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
[BLACK EDGE MEMBER B]
Yeah, give us the order, Riheet!

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:58.857 position:50% align:center
[BLACK EDGE MEMBERS shouting]

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
Just shut up.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
This is only just
the first step for us.

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:06.823 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't wanna get ahead
of ourselves and mess this up.

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:10.952 position:50% align:center
We dark elves have
been oppressed

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:13.663 position:50% align:center
by the people of this city
for over a hundred years.

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
And now we've finally
been given an opportunity

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:18.418 position:50% align:center
to take our revenge.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.755 position:50% align:center
All of us swore to follow you.

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.506 position:50% align:center
[BLACK EDGE MEMBER A]
I can't wait to see their faces

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.342 position:50% align:center
when we take control
over Orvelia

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center
and make this nation ours!

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:28.511 position:50% align:center
[BLACK EDGE MEMBER B] Until
then, we'll keep pretending

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center
to be harmless.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:32.140 position:50% align:center
[BLACK EDGE MEMBER chattering]

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:34.059 position:50% align:center
So loud.

[grunts]

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:43.068 position:50% align:center
Soon this whole nation
will belong to all of us.

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:01.836 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:33.368 position:50% align:center
[ELDER KNIGHT] Good,
keep up with your training.

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
I'm just following orders.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.246 position:50% align:center
Right, orders.

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
I guess it has been quite a
while since the scouts took off.

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:41.835 position:50% align:center
They seem to be taking
a long time.

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.044 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:46.006 position:50% align:center
[ELDER KNIGHT]
I hope that nothing went wrong.

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
You don't have to worry because
Clause is there with them.

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
[FLEGG] I don't see any
Demons around anywhere.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.681 position:50% align:center
Are we sure those
reports you got

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
on the sightings are accurate?

00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:58.518 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:00.061 position:50% align:center
It's possible they saw
wolves or something

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center
and mistook them for Demons.

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.691 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I bet that's
probably what happened.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
It sure would be nice
to head back

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:08.695 position:50% align:center
and get somethin' good to eat.

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.865 position:50% align:center
Did you hear something, Clause?

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
There's something out there.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
[CLAUSE]
Prepare for combat.

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
Let's get out of here.

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
U-Understood!

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:26.129 position:50% align:center
[SCOUT A screams]

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.383 position:50% align:center
[SCOUT A screaming]

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.552 position:50% align:center
Where the heck did
they come from?

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:33.595 position:50% align:center
Flegg!

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:35.805 position:50% align:center
I'm okay.

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Gran.

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
There's more!

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
No!

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:44.856 position:50% align:center
Hold on--!

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:50.278 position:50% align:center
[GRAN]
Flegg!

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:52.238 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:56.868 position:50% align:center
[CLAUSE]
Gran! Can you move?

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:58.620 position:50% align:center
Flegg was--

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.288 position:50% align:center
I'll try and hold them off here.

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:03.708 position:50% align:center
Head back and report the
attack to the commander!

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
Damn!

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
Go!

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Gran.

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:28.024 position:50% align:center
No one gets through!

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
[MAN E]
It's terrible!

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:32.153 position:50% align:center
[MAN F]
What is it? What happened?

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
[TOWNFOLK E]
A scout finally came back,

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
but he's the only one who did.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.616 position:50% align:center
[MAN F]
Only one? Why?

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.910 position:50% align:center
[MAN E]
I don't know!

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
Hey! Hold on!

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
Wait, what's going on?

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:48.128 position:50% align:center
Were the rest of the scouts
attacked by Demons?

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
[GRAN]
I'm here to make my report.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:03.643 position:50% align:center
We encountered Demons
in the King's Forest.

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:07.105 position:50% align:center
The scouts engaged in battle
against this threat.

00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:08.231 position:50% align:center
[NOBLES gasp]

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.900 position:50% align:center
How many demons did
you fight against?

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:14.320 position:50% align:center
[GRAN]
The total number is... unknown.

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER C]
Hey! Hey, are you all right?

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:18.742 position:50% align:center
Get him medical attention.

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER C]
Sir!

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
[SCHMIDT]
We must do something.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:22.829 position:50% align:center
If we don't take precautions,

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:25.457 position:50% align:center
soon Demons will
enter the capital.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.335 position:50% align:center
We must stop the Demons,
no matter the cost!

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
I think we should send
more men into the forest.

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
They can hold them off for us!

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.882 position:50% align:center
[MORIHAM]
If we send in more soldiers,

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:36.760 position:50% align:center
we would recklessly be
throwing their lives away.

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:39.637 position:50% align:center
Right now, I believe we
should conserve our power.

00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:42.515 position:50% align:center
There's a great chance we could
see an onslaught of Demons

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:45.018 position:50% align:center
just like we did 100 years ago.

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
Then what should we do?

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
We should use the manpower
I acquired: The Black Edge.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:54.944 position:50% align:center
We decided the dark elves
cannot be trusted.

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
[WETTER]
Exactly!

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
It goes against everything
we believe in!

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
For our honor,
we cannot accept their aid!

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center
Do not lose sight of
who our enemies are.

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
Our enemies are the Demons.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.872 position:50% align:center
When our nation is under
this grave threat,

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:07.457 position:50% align:center
we cannot waste precious time

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.835 position:50% align:center
with useless bickering
over differences in race.

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:14.047 position:50% align:center
Please decide, Chancellor.

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:19.177 position:50% align:center
[ELDER KNIGHT] Gran was the
only one who came back.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.347 position:50% align:center
There's not much hope.
The rest couldn't have made it.

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
I know how you must feel,
but let it go.

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Kasel!

00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Frey. What are you doing here?

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center
I heard that the
scouts returned,

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
but that... only one
of them came back.

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:52.585 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Gran was the
only one to return.

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:54.671 position:50% align:center
But Clause is safe, isn't he?

00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:56.631 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
He's gotta be.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.634 position:50% align:center
That's why I have to go.

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:03.388 position:50% align:center
Why are you leaving?

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
I have to go find Clause.

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
You can't go out there.
Kasel, you're an apprentice--

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.395 position:50% align:center
you're not ready
to fight Demons!

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
What if they attack you
while you're all alone?

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
[KASEL] It doesn't matter.
I'm going to save Clause!

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:17.027 position:50% align:center
Wait!

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center
I'm never going to lose
anyone I care about again!

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.448 position:50% align:center
I made a promise.

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:26.036 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't let anyone else
I care about die again!

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
Kasel.

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:30.665 position:50% align:center
I'm going with you.

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:31.541 position:50% align:center
No, you're not!

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:32.792 position:50% align:center
I am!

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:34.669 position:50% align:center
I also don't ever
want to lose someone

00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
who is dear to me, like Clause!

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
Besides, my skills
as a priestess

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:40.467 position:50% align:center
should be useful to you.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.553 position:50% align:center
Frey, no, you have to stay here.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:47.098 position:50% align:center
Clause always asked me to
take care of you, Kasel.

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:50.435 position:50% align:center
Nothing you say will
stop me from coming.

00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:48.970 position:50% align:center
[FREY] In order to protect
those dear to us,

00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:51.806 position:50% align:center
we left Orvelia to
go on a journey!

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:56.019 position:50% align:center
When we arrived at our
destination, the King's Forest,

00:23:56.102 --> 00:24:00.565 position:50% align:center
we witnessed a sad reality
and a surprising truth.
