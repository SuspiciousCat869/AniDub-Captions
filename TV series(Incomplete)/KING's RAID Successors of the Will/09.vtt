One hundred years have passed

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:16.766 position:50% align:center
since the Battle
of Galluah Plains,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.228 position:50% align:center
where King Kyle defeated
the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center
The Demons rise again,
threatening the world,

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:26.693 position:50% align:center
spreading fear
and unrest to all.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center
The Demons...

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.659 position:50% align:center
The Demons took my mom.

[NARRATOR]
On their way to Ogria Mountain,

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:40.623 position:50% align:center
Kasel and his friends meet
some refugees at a shelter.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:44.085 position:50% align:center
There, Frey finds a young
orphan girl named Elise,

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:47.172 position:50% align:center
and attempts to heal
her wounded heart.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:38.992 position:50% align:center
So this place was the
town that got attacked.

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:41.578 position:50% align:center
It's kind of scary.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.957 position:50% align:center
I'm getting a weird vibe here.

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:47.375 position:50% align:center
[FREY gasps]

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.927 position:50% align:center
I can't explain it exactly,
but something feels off.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:58.887 position:50% align:center
That guy--

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.847 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Maybe he's a villager.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.850 position:50% align:center
I'll go check if he's okay.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.894 position:50% align:center
Um... excuse me.

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:07.729 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.317 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Roi, what did you do?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
He's an undead.

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:15.737 position:50% align:center
Undead?

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.696 position:50% align:center
[KASEL gasps]

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.532 position:50% align:center
[UNDEAD MAN A groans]

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center
What?

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.413 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.090 position:50% align:center

[gasps]

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50% align:center
Look, over there!

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
[ROI]
To the house, quickly!

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.526 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Get away!

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.125 position:50% align:center
Wait!

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center
So this candle must be
the light I saw flashing.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
Thank you, mister, um, mister...

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:37.110 position:50% align:center
I'm Johann. I'm glad you
all got away safely.

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center
Those things, I've
noticed they react

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:42.323 position:50% align:center
to loud noises and
high-pitched voices.

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
Even inside, they can hear
you, so please be careful.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center
Can someone explain
what's wrong with those people?

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:52.500 position:50% align:center
And, Roi, why did you kill him?

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
Why are the undead here?

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.589 position:50% align:center
The undead?

00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:00.342 position:50% align:center
How long has this
been going on?

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.140 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN] This nightmare
began when the Demons

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
attacked our village
a little while back.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:14.481 position:50% align:center
Several villagers
were killed by them.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50% align:center
Some of us decided to evacuate.

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:21.946 position:50% align:center
However, a few of us
wanted to stay behind.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center
We were all terrified
of the Demons,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.577 position:50% align:center
so we locked ourselves
in our homes.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.662 position:50% align:center
Eventually the Demons left,

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:33.708 position:50% align:center
but we realized they took
the dead villagers with them.

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center
And then, not long after,
many of the villagers

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
we had thought were
dead came back to us,

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
all of them acting strange.

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:42.467 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.761 position:50% align:center
So what happened to them?

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN]
I don't know.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:50.392 position:50% align:center
All we know is they were
attacked by the Demons.

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:53.395 position:50% align:center
At first, we were glad
to see them again.

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:57.607 position:50% align:center
Until they all started
to attack the rest of us.

00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
I am the only one who survived
of the villagers left here.

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
When those who returned
started attacking,

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center
I boarded up the windows

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
and gathered as much
food as I could.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
That's the only way I was
able to survive by myself.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:16.042 position:50% align:center
Violas.

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
[ELISE] No, my mom.
She loved these flowers.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.173 position:50% align:center
Poor Elise.

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:23.717 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN]
Elise?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.177 position:50% align:center
Do you know where
my daughter is?

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
Is she... Is she still alive?

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.849 position:50% align:center
Daughter?

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
Yes. Elise is safe and sound.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.480 position:50% align:center
She's at the shelter in
the village to the south.

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:45.905 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:50.660 position:50% align:center
I was... separated
from her in the attack.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.207 position:50% align:center
Was she doing okay?
I hope she hasn't been crying.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50% align:center
She's fine.

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.712 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she would be happy
to know that you're alive;

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:02.672 position:50% align:center
she misses you so much!

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center
It's true. You should go to the
shelter and reunite with her!

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN] I'm sorry.
I can't leave here yet.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:14.309 position:50% align:center
Isn't it hard staying
here by yourself?

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:17.145 position:50% align:center
Yes, it is.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
Still, I can't leave.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.566 position:50% align:center
There's something left
I have to finish here.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:23.318 position:50% align:center
But why? It's dangerous!

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.278 position:50% align:center
[ROI]
Enough of that.

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
You heard the man--
he told you he can't leave.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
So just let him be.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN] By the way, I meant to
ask, why did you come here?

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
We're traveling.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
Just passing through here on
our way to Ogria Mountain.

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see.

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center
In that case, if you
have nowhere to stay,

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.423 position:50% align:center
you're welcome here.

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
It's too dangerous
out there anyway.

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:49.552 position:50% align:center
Please stay here.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:52.806 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow I can point you in the
direction of Ogria Mountain.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:56.810 position:50% align:center
You want us to stay with those
creepy things walking around?

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
The undead are active
during the day and night,

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:03.066 position:50% align:center
but I think we'd be better off
walking during the day.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.901 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:06.986 position:50% align:center
[CLEO sighs]

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
That was kinda tiring.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.490 position:50% align:center
It was.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
But you know,

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
I finally figured out
why I felt weird.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
Even though we knew this town
was attacked by Demons,

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50% align:center
there weren't any
corpses around.

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center
Yeah, cause they
all started moving.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it.

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:26.131 position:50% align:center
I never expected to run into
undead in a place like this.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
Somebody explain,
what are the undead?

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
I think Johann said
that the villagers

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
killed in the Demon attack
returned as undead.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
Dead people coming back to life?
Is that even possible?

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.730 position:50% align:center
They're undead.
They're moving corpses.

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
They don't come back to life.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
Moving corpses?

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:49.362 position:50% align:center
In the records documenting
the battle 100 years ago,

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
the one that took place
on Galluah Plains,

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50% align:center
it's mentioned that the dead
rose up and fought again.

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
The text also said that
Demons are the ones

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.456 position:50% align:center
who control the undead.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.082 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
I remember Dominix telling me

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:04.377 position:50% align:center
something similar at one point,

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.713 position:50% align:center
so I'm pretty sure
it's the truth.

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:09.466 position:50% align:center
But I don't know
all of the details.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
[sighs] If only I had the time

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
to study the records
from 100 years ago,

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50% align:center
I might've found something.

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
But we had to leave in a hurry
and I couldn't read them all.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.684 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:22.020 position:50% align:center
No, it's not your
fault or anything.

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.646 position:50% align:center
Dominix should've
told me sooner

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.900 position:50% align:center
so I could've prepared better.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:29.486 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess that's true.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:33.948 position:50% align:center
Roi, how is it that you know
so much about the undead?

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
I did some research on it once
back at the Tower of the Sage.

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:40.205 position:50% align:center
So, I guess,
those people we saw,

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:42.123 position:50% align:center
or rather the undead we saw,

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:45.001 position:50% align:center
all used to be humans
who lived here?

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
Don't get ideas.

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:48.588 position:50% align:center
I understand what you
might be thinking,

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
but there's no way to help
them now--they're dead.

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:55.261 position:50% align:center
Okay. But we can't just let the
undead hang out in this village.

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't that be dangerous?

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
I mean, we got attacked
when we showed up here.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.187 position:50% align:center
What, so now we should
kill all of them?

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
We don't have time for this--

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:08.149 position:50% align:center
we need to concentrate
on the Holy Sword.

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:10.151 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
I guess you're right.

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
That being said,

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
I kinda wonder why
Johann won't go to Elise.

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
[JOHANN] You won't believe
what I heard today.

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
Her name is Lisa,
but who is she?

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:44.532 position:50% align:center
That woman is my wife.

Wait, so it's Elise's mom?

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.328 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's true.

helped me to capture her

I could never imagine
leaving her alone.

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:16.147 position:50% align:center

No! She's still alive,
she has to be. I know she is.

I mean, when you're dead
then you stop moving, right?

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:27.242 position:50% align:center
Lisa just isn't feeling
very well at the moment.

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center
She was attacked by a Demon,
so it'll take time to heal.

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:35.166 position:50% align:center
And you all delivered
such good news!

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
Now I know Elise is alive,

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Lisa will want to
get better and got to her.
