One hundred years have passed

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:16.266 position:50% align:center
since the Battle

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.811 position:50% align:center

the Dark Lord Angmund.

Kasel is told he is
the son of King Kyle.

To protect those dear to him,

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
he searches for the
Holy Sword Aea.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:39.998 position:50% align:center
He departs on a journey to find
the keys to unseal the sword.

To acquire the Holy Sword,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.669 position:50% align:center
you're going to have

Well, anyway...

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:02.974 position:50% align:center
You're supposedly
the son of King Kyle,

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.560 position:50% align:center

but the only time that a Holy

00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
was when King Kyle was alive.

If Kasel is really the
heir to the sword,

kind of a special thing?

It's not really a big deal.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:07.490 position:50% align:center

to fight, that's all.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.578 position:50% align:center
That's true, too.

During a battle,
you must think simply.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
Sure, it's important to think
about what you're doing

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.845 position:50% align:center
during a battle,
but not just "simply."

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
My father, King Kyle,
and the Holy Sword...

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:35.393 position:50% align:center
There's so much
I don't know yet.

But I want to protect

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:41.024 position:50% align:center

Well, I can understand
that motivation,

00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:45.945 position:50% align:center
but as for its power,

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:48.865 position:50% align:center
I wonder what kind of power
the Holy Sword has.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:51.034 position:50% align:center
Back when I was studying
with the church,

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:53.370 position:50% align:center
they taught us that
the sword had the power

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:54.954 position:50% align:center
to defeat the Dark Lord.

00:15:55.038 --> 00:15:57.999 position:50% align:center
That's basically what everyone
knows about the sword, isn't it?

00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
Heh. I guess you're right.

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.004 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
A sword so powerful,

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:05.382 position:50% align:center
it supposedly can
defeat the Dark Lord,

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
an exceptionally strong Demon.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:11.388 position:50% align:center
But what if the wielder

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
Would he be able to use it?

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:16.434 position:50% align:center
I mean, if he dies, isn't
that the end of it all?

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
Yes, that is true.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.940 position:50% align:center
Well, Kasel is a
little bit ordinary.

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
That is also true.

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:25.944 position:50% align:center
It might not seem like it,

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.074 position:50% align:center
[KASEL chuckles]

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:32.409 position:50% align:center
Whatever the case is,

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
it's still our goal to
unseal the Holy Sword.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:37.580 position:50% align:center
Even if Kasel is
an ordinary guy.

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:40.959 position:50% align:center
Also, there's no guarantee
that the Dark Lord will return.

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.877 position:50% align:center
Doesn't a sorcerer need
to somehow summon him

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
to bring him back?

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:47.632 position:50% align:center
If the sorcerer Malduk is
alive, he could summon him.

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.175 position:50% align:center
Well then, if he's alive,

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
then it's likely that the
Dark Lord is coming back.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.723 position:50% align:center
So it's best for us
to assume the worst.

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Angmund, the Dark Lord.

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:02.647 position:50% align:center
He too has only appeared
in history once before.

[KASEL]
Really?

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
It's true. Just once,
during King Kyle's reign.

And the only ones
who could confirm

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:12.699 position:50% align:center
the Dark Lord's existence were
King Kyle and his companions.
