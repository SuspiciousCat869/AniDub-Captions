[NARRATOR]
One hundred years have passed

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.141 position:50% align:center
since the Battle
of Galluah Plains,

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:19.602 position:50% align:center
where King Kyle defeated
the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.814 position:50% align:center
The Demons rise again,
threatening the world,

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:26.359 position:50% align:center
spreading fear
and unrest to all.

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:29.112 position:50% align:center
To unseal the Holy Sword Aea,

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.490 position:50% align:center
Kasel and his friend
continue on their journey.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
Together, they must unlock
the two remaining seals.

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.913 position:50% align:center
Arriving at Ogria Mountain,

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.458 position:50% align:center
they hope to meet
orc chief Aeatola,

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
who is key to unlocking
the next seal.

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
This must be the Red Valley!

00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:31.359 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK laughing]

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.158 position:50% align:center
What exactly is so funny?

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.368 position:50% align:center
Humans are so pathetic.

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:43.246 position:50% align:center
They fight, they cry,
they destroy each other.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.914 position:50% align:center
Can you hear them?

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.291 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
No.

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:49.419 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK] I've waited a
hundred years for this feast.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.963 position:50% align:center
It's very exciting, isn't it?

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:55.633 position:50% align:center
The Dark Lord Angmund will bring
about the world's destruction.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50% align:center
Don't get too excited.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.137 position:50% align:center
You're just the sorcerer
who summons him.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.098 position:50% align:center
I don't care about the
world being destroyed.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:05.101 position:50% align:center
I only want to see
the undead dance!

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.645 position:50% align:center
Just like before.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:15.153 position:50% align:center
Here, Father, I opened
the window for you.

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:18.323 position:50% align:center
The weather is
absolutely lovely today.

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:28.917 position:50% align:center
[JANE] It seems like all
he does is sleep lately.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.337 position:50% align:center
I believe the last time
the king met with his doctors,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.424 position:50% align:center
he had asked them to give
him some stronger medication.

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.470 position:50% align:center
There's no need
for you to worry.

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
All of us here will be
sure to support him.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK] While I was a sorcerer
for the Republic of Grey,

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:54.025 position:50% align:center
I dedicated my life
to my research.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.698 position:50% align:center
[THEO] I'm sorry.
I will be going to war.

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:01.449 position:50% align:center
[JANE]
But you...

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
I promise you I'll return.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:06.329 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you to wait for me.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
I sometimes dream about what
my life might've been like

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:15.422 position:50% align:center
if I were not born a princess,
or my father wasn't king.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
Maybe we could be
together, Theo.

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:19.718 position:50% align:center
Jane.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
[JANE]
Malduk!

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
What's this? A lowly knight
seducing the princess?

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.228 position:50% align:center
I have no ill intentions.

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
I ready to sacrifice
my life for this country.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
Steal her heart then simply
abandon her to leave for war?

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.613 position:50% align:center
You're not a gentleman.
You're a disgusting man.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:43.658 position:50% align:center
Stop involving yourself
in the royal family's affairs.

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center
It's not your concern.

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK]
Hmm.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
Princess Jane, you really
should be more wary of people.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
No, Father!

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:59.883 position:50% align:center
[NOBLE A] To pass away right
before the start of a war.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.469 position:50% align:center
If our enemies find out,
we're finished!

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
[NOBLE B] We don't have a proper
heir to ascend the throne.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
What's going to happen
to the Republic of Grey?

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50% align:center
You can bring my father
back with magic?

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
I've devoted my life
to this research,

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
and I can finally use the
forbidden magic successfully.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:24.699 position:50% align:center
Now I can fully show you my
true power as a sorcerer.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK] My forbidden
spell was a success.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:35.293 position:50% align:center
The king rose again,
as an undead!

00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
Are you attacking me?

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50% align:center
I'm exiling you!

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.304 position:50% align:center
Now why would you go
and do a thing like that?

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm the reason

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.766 position:50% align:center
the king was able to
come back to life.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
I saved him. All my
research paid off.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
I created such
a beautiful magic!

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
You're a liar. You used
him for your experiment!

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.737 position:50% align:center
Well, the experiment was
a success, wouldn't you say?

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:05.699 position:50% align:center
I was able to
resurrect the dead.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:09.828 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you do not understand
what an accomplishment this is.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.414 position:50% align:center
You should be
celebrating with me.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:16.626 position:50% align:center
Nobody has ever successfully
completed a spell like this one.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
Now my name will be known
across this entire country--

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.007 position:50% align:center
no, the whole world!

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.133 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK laughs]

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.552 position:50% align:center
No, the king's grave
has been defiled!

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.388 position:50% align:center
You've fallen so low
you've become a devil!

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
I breathed life into
a corpse. I am not a devil!

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center
I'm God.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK laughs]

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.232 position:50% align:center
You're insane.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
I will never allow you to live
in this kingdom ever again.

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK] Rather than praise
my incredible magic,

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:50.285 position:50% align:center
they insulted me and
threw me into exile.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK]
They are just fools.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
One day I will
make them all pay.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.793 position:50% align:center
The castles,
the towns, the people,

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center
this entire nation will die.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:04.466 position:50% align:center
I'll raise them from
the depths of hell!

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.222 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center
Maria! After all this time,
we should enjoy this banquet!

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.231 position:50% align:center
My only job is to help
you summon the Dark Lord.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK laughs]

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:31.284 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Ooo, scary.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
Did I already say
these canyons are red

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
because of the blood spilled
in a war with the orcs?

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.416 position:50% align:center
Why would you choose to
live in a place like this?

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.126 position:50% align:center
They have bad taste.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
Like I said before,
I don't that's actually true,

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.298 position:50% align:center
but orcs are known to love war.

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
I find it hard to believe
anyone would love war.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.262 position:50% align:center
You'd be surprised by all
the weird people there are.

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
[UNDEAD ORC A groaning]

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.600 position:50% align:center
It's like I summoned them.

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50% align:center
C'mon, let's go!

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
[KAULAH]
Hm.

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.921 position:50% align:center
[DALE]
Master Kaulah!

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.965 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:32.429 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Dale.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:36.516 position:50% align:center
Master Kaulah, why did
you come here by yourself?

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:37.600 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:40.103 position:50% align:center
[DALE]
Damn, they keep coming!

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.314 position:50% align:center
That looks bad.

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center
Are they fighting each other?

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
They're not.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.403 position:50% align:center
Look carefully.
Those are undead.

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
The orcs also have undead?

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:54.951 position:50% align:center
[KAULAH yells]

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.286 position:50% align:center
Master Kaulah!

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.663 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:05.003 position:50% align:center
Humans?

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:10.300 position:50% align:center
Step aside unless you
want to get set on fire!

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Hot flames, coming right up!

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.155 position:50% align:center
[KAULAH] You saved us.
We are very grateful.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
Um, well--

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
[DALE]
Don't move!

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
[KAULAH]
Dale, stop that!

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:41.498 position:50% align:center
We cannot allow humans
to enter orc territory.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.333 position:50% align:center
That is the chief's order.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center
Stand down, Dale. I have
been waiting for this one.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:50.590 position:50% align:center
I knew he would come
here three days ago.

00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:52.676 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
[DALE]
I see.

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:58.473 position:50% align:center
[KAULAH] Please excuse
my apprentice's temper.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:01.434 position:50% align:center
I'd like to spend some time
speaking with you.

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:05.230 position:50% align:center
But before that,
please give us one moment.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.691 position:50% align:center
I must ask the ancient
spirits to forgive us

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:13.863 position:50% align:center
for spoiling this land.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:17.075 position:50% align:center
[KAULAH, DALE] O great ancient
spirits of the orcs,

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
may you rest in eternal
silence and peace.

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:33.383 position:50% align:center
[KAULAH]
Let's start again.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:37.345 position:50% align:center
I am the shaman of this
tribe, My name is Kaulah.

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center
This is Dale.

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
You can call me Kasel.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.269 position:50% align:center
Champion, I have
been awaiting you.

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center
[KAULAH] From time to time,
the ancient orc spirts

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.066 position:50% align:center
come to me in my dreams.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
They often bring
messages as well.

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.863 position:50% align:center
We call them prophetic dreams.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
I've heard about this.

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
Orc shamans are important
in their tribes

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.368 position:50% align:center
because they can often

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center
So Kasel appeared to
you three days ago.

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:06.541 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.294 position:50% align:center
In the dream, the world
was thrown into chaos,

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
but a human hero brought
hope to all of us.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
How can we know you're
this hero? Who are you?

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
How rude!

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50% align:center

an orc named Dale?

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry about him.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center
I know it goes
against your nature,

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
but a shaman must learn to keep
a calm mind and open heart.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.733 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Dale, just calm down.

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center
Our group has traveled
to the Red Valley

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
to meet with the orc
chief Master Aeatola.

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.783 position:50% align:center
I'm on an urgent quest
to unseal the Holy Sword.

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:43.661 position:50% align:center
Then you must be the heir
we've been waiting for!

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
Hah! What a foolish lie!

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
Acting like you know
of Chief Aeatola

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
when he passed away long ago!

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.629 position:50% align:center
Master Aeatola is dead?

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:56.132 position:50% align:center
Yes. The chief of our
tribe is named Sieg.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
But we traveled
all the way here!

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50% align:center
It is possible that Sieg may
have received instructions

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:07.852 position:50% align:center
from the late Chief Aeatola
about the Holy Sword's seal.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:10.855 position:50% align:center
Then could I please speak
to Chief Sieg instead?

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.858 position:50% align:center
You can't. We know humans
are working with the Demons.

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
We can't allow them
to enter our territory.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
That is the chief's order.
We will not question it!

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.534 position:50% align:center
Humans are working with Demons?

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:24.077 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.830 position:50% align:center
Recently, a man
came to Red Valley.

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.040 position:50% align:center
He had claimed to be a sorcerer.

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
After that, many
of our tribesmen

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
disappeared mysteriously.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.089 position:50% align:center
And then they returned,

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
but it was different from
how they were before.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
They were undead, walking
corpses who attacked us.

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
That sorcerer was working
with the Demons.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:51.062 position:50% align:center
He turned our fallen
comrades into undead.

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:52.772 position:50% align:center
There's no way that's true!

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:56.735 position:50% align:center
No human would ever work with
the demons. That's impossible!

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me what
the sorcerer looked like?

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.406 position:50% align:center
I was told he had purple eyes

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:04.325 position:50% align:center
and long dark hair that
ran down to his waist.

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
Does that sound familiar to you?

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:09.205 position:50% align:center
Well, I know a lot of sorcerers
from the Tower of the Sage,

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.875 position:50% align:center
so I thought I might
recognize him.

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center
But I honestly don't remember
anyone who looked like that.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:16.296 position:50% align:center
Roi, do you?

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:17.714 position:50% align:center
[ROI]
No, I don't either.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.466 position:50% align:center
Regardless of who
the sorcerer is,

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:21.593 position:50% align:center
we have to unseal
the Holy Sword.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:24.346 position:50% align:center
We're running out of time.

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you! Please take
us to see Chief Sieg!

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:36.399 position:50% align:center
All right then. I understand.

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:39.903 position:50% align:center
It will be my honor to
escort you to the chief.

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:41.446 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:44.532 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, the chief doesn't
approve of humans right now.

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
If he attacks you,
I'll protect you with my life.

[KASEL]
I couldn't ask you to--

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
Master Kaulah, I can't
let you risk your life

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.376 position:50% align:center
just to protect some
lowly human boy.

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:57.128 position:50% align:center
I must do what I can
to protect our future.

00:13:57.212 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50% align:center
That means protecting the
heir to the Holy Sword.

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:02.133 position:50% align:center
Dale, do you ever recall a time

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
when I misinterpreted
one of my dreams.

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
Well, no, you haven't.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
Kasel, I assure you that
you don't have to worry.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:13.228 position:50% align:center
The Orcs are willing
to sacrifice their lives

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
for a cause they
truly believe in.

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:18.525 position:50% align:center
Master Kaulah, I'm honored
that you would, but...

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center
...before that, I think
it would be best

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:22.654 position:50% align:center
if I speak with
Chief Sieg himself.

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:24.030 position:50% align:center
Yes, very well.

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center
However, I must request that
you come alone with me

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.284 position:50% align:center
to meet the chief.

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.704 position:50% align:center

have to wait here.

If I bring along other humans,

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.794 position:50% align:center
I believe that the orcs
will be on their guard.

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
I want to prevent any fighting.

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:42.757 position:50% align:center
Fighting? Ugh.

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:46.803 position:50% align:center
Understood. The three of us
will stay here and wait for him.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
Kasel, just be careful then.

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:51.307 position:50% align:center
I will.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:59.733 position:50% align:center
Do you think he's all right?

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
I don't know.
What do you think, Roi?

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
Well, they're orcs--

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.448 position:50% align:center
they have a very specific
chain of command.

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center
Everyone is ranked by
their size and strength,

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:12.287 position:50% align:center
which means their chief is
the strongest among them.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center
So that means Kasel will
have to win the approval

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.042 position:50% align:center
of this Chief Sieg, correct?

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.878 position:50% align:center
[ROI] Yeah. I wonder
how he'll respond.

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:21.296 position:50% align:center

I wonder what that is, though.

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
It looks like the
tattoos the orcs had.

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
Huh. Yeah, they kinda do.

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:41.691 position:50% align:center
Do you think it
represents something?

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:43.443 position:50% align:center
Lemme think for a sec.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.820 position:50% align:center
Usually, orc tattoos
have specific meaning,

00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
like warding off
illness and injuries.

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:52.077 position:50% align:center
They pass them down generation
through generation.

00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:56.081 position:50% align:center
Based on what Master Kaulah
had explained to us,

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:58.541 position:50% align:center
it seems like orc shamans
put a lot of value

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.335 position:50% align:center
in their dreams as well.

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:02.671 position:50% align:center
It must be an important
part of their culture.

00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:04.005 position:50% align:center

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:35.740 position:50% align:center
and must survive to
protect this world.

00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center
If anyone tries to
hurt him or kill him,

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:39.828 position:50% align:center
I will sacrifice myself.

00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:41.538 position:50% align:center
Keeping him safe is important,

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:44.624 position:50% align:center
even if that means
fighting against you.

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
Then I'll have to
destroy you first!

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
Just wait a moment,
Chief Sieg!

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:03.935 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Is this how the orcs always are?

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
Must you decide things by force?

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
Why are you immediately
jumping into a fight?

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
[SIEG] Demons have
returned to our lands.

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.778 position:50% align:center
The orcs must come
together and unite.

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:17.198 position:50% align:center
Anyone who disrupts our
way of life must die.

00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:20.493 position:50% align:center
This is how we protect
the safety of our future.

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't the future be
something you build together

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
with your allies?

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:27.917 position:50% align:center
Leaders should do everything
they can to protect everyone!

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
That's foolish!

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:39.429 position:50% align:center
Sometimes we must make small
sacrifices to save many!

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, we would all
be killed off in the end.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:46.603 position:50% align:center
That's not-- No!
It's not that simple!

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
There's never a justification
for sacrificing innocent people!

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
And how would you protect them?

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:54.277 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
I'll help everyone.

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
I'll use my own
body as a shield!

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:59.324 position:50% align:center
Whatever it takes to save them!

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:03.244 position:50% align:center
[SIEG] Hah! And just how many
lives do you expect to save?

00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:06.623 position:50% align:center
You're a puny,
pathetic little human!

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
Do you really believe you can
use your body as a shield?

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center
I don't care at all about
what happens to me in the end.

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
My only goal is to
protect this world!

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
Let me explain
something to you, boy,

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:29.562 position:50% align:center
conviction without
power is worthless!

00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
You are more orc-like
than I thought.

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:48.873 position:50% align:center
You have something you value
far more than your own life.

00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
Chief Aeatola did
leave instructions.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.673 position:50% align:center
If someone arrives claiming to
be the heir to the Holy Sword,

00:20:56.756 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
then they must be tested
at the Holy Shrine.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center
What kind of test is it?

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
[SIEG] I believe something
of importance was left there.

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.726 position:50% align:center
You must bring that back to me.

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:10.311 position:50% align:center
The Holy Shrine is
a truly sacred place

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:13.106 position:50% align:center
where our ancestral
spirits reside.

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
It is a source of wisdom and
power for all of us orcs.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.654 position:50% align:center
Those who choose to
visit are often faced

00:21:19.738 --> 00:21:21.948 position:50% align:center
with a difficult test.

00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:23.658 position:50% align:center
But not many return.

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:26.911 position:50% align:center
It will take a lot for you to
overcome this challenge.

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:28.747 position:50% align:center
If you can return
from the shrine,

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.458 position:50% align:center
we will accept that you
are the true heir.

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.377 position:50% align:center
[ORC A]
Chief Sieg!

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:38.423 position:50% align:center
We have captured humans
who defiled the Holy Fountain.

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:40.008 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
Kasel, it's not what you think.
I didn't defile the fountain.

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
This whole thing is a huge
misunderstanding, you know.

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:49.434 position:50% align:center
As you can guess,
it's Cleo's fault again.

00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:52.228 position:50% align:center
Your friends will be
held here as hostages.

00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:54.272 position:50% align:center
If the ancestral
spirits determine

00:21:54.356 --> 00:21:57.067 position:50% align:center
that you are not the heir
to the Holy Sword,

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.904 position:50% align:center
you and your friends will
all be put to death!

00:22:00.987 --> 00:22:03.656 position:50% align:center
[ORCS yelling]

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.367 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.578 position:50% align:center
[SIEG] Kaulah,
escort him to the shrine.

00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:10.288 position:50% align:center
Yes, Chief.

00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:13.958 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.636 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Kasel enters the Holy Shrine

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.641 position:50% align:center
to prove that he is the true
heir to the Holy Sword Aea.

00:23:53.725 --> 00:23:57.896 position:50% align:center
What sort of test could
await him there?

00:23:57.979 --> 00:24:00.648 position:50% align:center
Please return to us safely!
