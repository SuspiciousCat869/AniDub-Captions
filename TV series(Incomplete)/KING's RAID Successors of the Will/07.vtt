[NARRATOR]
One hundred years have passed

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
since the Battle
of Galluah Plains,

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.978 position:50% align:center
where King Kyle defeated
the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:23.023 position:50% align:center
The Demons rise again,
threatening the world,

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.692 position:50% align:center
spreading fear
and unrest to all.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
A band of dark elf mercenaries
called the Black Edge

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:32.073 position:50% align:center
were hired by Orvelia
to hunt Demons.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.534 position:50% align:center
However, they have
a secret goal:

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:37.203 position:50% align:center
To exact revenge on Orvelia.

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
I want the Black Edge to
appear more impressive

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.667 position:50% align:center
than their knights.

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:46.087 position:50% align:center
I will lay the
groundwork for you.

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.882 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.945 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:50.837 position:50% align:center
[TAMM yells]

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
[MORIHAM]
You've returned.

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:16.279 position:50% align:center
We have, and our
mission was a success.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:17.655 position:50% align:center
Well done.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.284 position:50% align:center
Behl wants to see you.
He said he must speak with you.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:22.827 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
With me?

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:25.205 position:50% align:center
[MORIHAM] Right now, Behl is
consulting with the astrologer.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
The kingdom will soon
launch official operations

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:28.958 position:50% align:center
to hunt the Demons.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.794 position:50% align:center
This is good for us.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.379 position:50% align:center
It will provide
more opportunities

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
to show off your power.

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:41.971 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET] Are you certain
of this, Ophelia?

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.516 position:50% align:center
[OPHELIA]
Yes, the Day of Lea is near.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.976 position:50% align:center
The red moon quickly approaches.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.022 position:50% align:center
On that day, the "nocturnal sun"
will cross in front of the moon,

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
and the world will be
engulfed in darkness.

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:57.278 position:50% align:center
That's what the stars tell you?

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
Yes, Princess Scarlet.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:03.493 position:50% align:center
So we should expect the Dark
Lord Angmund to return?

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:07.038 position:50% align:center
Correct, that's what
I read in the stars.

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.665 position:50% align:center
We are not prepared for this.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:11.376 position:50% align:center
Unlike 100 years ago,
Orvelia does not have

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
the Holy Sword Aea,
or King Kyle.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center
Not to mention,
our king has fallen ill,

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.634 position:50% align:center
so we have no way to
resist the Dark Lord.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.012 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET]
Do not worry, Behl.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.139 position:50% align:center
The knights of Orvelia
will defend the kingdom

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.474 position:50% align:center
in my father's stead.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:31.146 position:50% align:center
I refuse to allow the Dark
Lord to destroy Orvelia.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
Ophelia, please continue to keep
watch over the star movements.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.401 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:41.531 position:50% align:center
Is that him?

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
I see you've returned.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
I have. I heard you
wish to speak with me.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.288 position:50% align:center
I wish for you to meet
the commander in chief

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
of the knights of Orvelia.

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:53.460 position:50% align:center
You must be Riheet
of the Black Edge, yes?

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
And who are you?

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.546 position:50% align:center
You watch your tongue!

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.633 position:50% align:center
You're speaking to her royal
highness, Princess Scarlet!

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.012 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET] I have been told
many wonderful things

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50% align:center
about your help with the Demons.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
I was the one who asked
Behl for an opportunity

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.685 position:50% align:center
to speak with you.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:12.896 position:50% align:center
Princess Scarlet would
like to make an offer

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.107 position:50% align:center
to you and the Black Edge.

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
I've heard your men
are quite talented.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.487 position:50% align:center
I would like to invite
you and the Black Edge

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
to join the knights of Orvelia.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
From now on, you will
be coordinating with us,

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50% align:center
is that acceptable to you?

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
Of course. It would be an honor
for us, Princess Scarlet.

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.209 position:50% align:center
I was told working with
you might be difficult,

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
but that's not the case.

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
Our regular meeting
is tomorrow morning.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.800 position:50% align:center
Please join us then.

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.854 position:50% align:center
[BLACK EDGE MEMBER A] We're
joining the knights of Orvelia?

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.272 position:50% align:center
We are.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:59.192 position:50% align:center
I guess that's a step up
from bein' mercenaries.

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
[BLACK EDGE MEMBER C]
We did it!

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
Are we really happy
about a stupid promotion?

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
I thought our goal was to
overthrow Orvelia's nobles

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.953 position:50% align:center
and take control
of this kingdom.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:12.247 position:50% align:center
You have to think about
the long game, Tamm.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.332 position:50% align:center
If we join the knights,
we can win their favor,

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
trick them,
and easily take over.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.753 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.631 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
Everyone, you must be on alert.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
Don't cause any trouble in town.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
Yeah, understood.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:28.972 position:50% align:center
Be a good little boy and
act on your best behavior.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
Stop treating me
like a little kid!

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.892 position:50% align:center
But you are a little kid!

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:33.768 position:50% align:center
[TAMM growls]

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
I'm not a kid, you--!

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
I didn't expect the princess
to be the commander in chief

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:38.523 position:50% align:center
of the knights.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:40.608 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.110 position:50% align:center
Unlike the rest of the nobles,

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
I don't think she will
be easy to deal with.

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.915 position:50% align:center
Demonic activity is
increasing daily in Orvelia.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:57.667 position:50% align:center
Perhaps the astrologer is right.

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50% align:center
And if so, the Dark Lord will
rise to power once again.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.882 position:50% align:center
All we can do for now
is hunt down the Demons

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.675 position:50% align:center
that keep appearing
near Orvelia.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.552 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:09.346 position:50% align:center
Welcome.

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET] This is Riheet,
from the Black Edge.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:16.353 position:50% align:center
As many of you know,
they have fought against

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:20.398 position:50% align:center
numerous Demons in
order to defend Orvelia.

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
Riheet will be joining
the knights as our ally.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
[ZIERRO growls]

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:29.199 position:50% align:center
Princess, I must speak!
They are dark elves.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.534 position:50% align:center
You must know Illya,
the one who defiled Lua,

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
the Goddess of Light,
was also a dark elf!

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
Yes. Of course I know that.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50% align:center
However, the Black Edge
have nothing to do with Illya

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
or what happened in the past.

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.592 position:50% align:center
If there is anyone else
who opposes the Black Edge

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:51.346 position:50% align:center
as our allies, I ask
that you speak now!

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
I see no problem
with it, Princess.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50% align:center
It would be most reassuring

00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:59.396 position:50% align:center
for the knights to
have your assistance.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.399 position:50% align:center
Is there anything else
you wish to say, Zierro?

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.069 position:50% align:center
Apologies, Your Highness.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:10.281 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait. I could actually
employ your services right away.

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
There are some dirty rats
scurrying about the town lately.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.830 position:50% align:center
Orvelia would be
so very grateful

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:19.124 position:50% align:center
if you helped chase them out.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
From what I've heard,

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.587 position:50% align:center
your group will take any job
so long as it pays well.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:27.799 position:50% align:center
And of course, I can
pay you handsomely.

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:30.260 position:50% align:center
You can keep that,
as a down payment.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.845 position:50% align:center
That is enough!

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center
[ZIERRO gasps]

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:44.232 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET] If the Demons are
able to infiltrate this city,

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:47.986 position:50% align:center
no amount of money
will help you.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you should focus
on defeating the Demons

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:53.491 position:50% align:center
rather than ridding
this place of rats.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
Starting today, the Black
Edge will be our friends.

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.082 position:50% align:center
I will not tolerate
anyone insulting them

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
or disrespecting them.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:04.794 position:50% align:center
Do all of you understand?

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.129 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Yes.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:08.340 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.008 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET]
Let's continue the meeting.

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
Demia, you mentioned
that you have

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.345 position:50% align:center
some new information for us?

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
[DEMIA]
Yes.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.931 position:50% align:center
We have received reports that
numerous Demons were sighted

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50% align:center
near the Forest of Elidora.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center
Then what should
our first move be?

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:25.357 position:50% align:center
I'd like to hear your opinion.

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
First, we should be sending
scouts in to investigate.

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
However...

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.205 position:50% align:center
I also think that we
need to reorganize

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
the knights' defensive strategy.

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:44.376 position:50% align:center
And why?

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
Right now, the main roads

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.879 position:50% align:center
and smaller villages
are defenseless,

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
while the castle and
town are well defended.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
So as it stands now,

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.552 position:50% align:center
it appears as though
we are only interested

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
in defending ourselves
and no one else.

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.433 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
I see. You have a sharp eye.

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:11.194 position:50% align:center
[ZIERRO]
Why would she--?

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50% align:center
Why would she allow the dark
elves to join the knights?

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:17.909 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hm?

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50% align:center
What do you want, Zierro?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.122 position:50% align:center
Hello, Father, fellow nobles.

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:23.998 position:50% align:center
I've come from the
knights' meeting.

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:26.793 position:50% align:center
And there is something I
must speak with you about.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
[MENOS]
Hmm. I understand your argument.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
All of us agree that it is not
ideal to have the dark elves

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:36.177 position:50% align:center
defending Orvelia for us
against the Demons.

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
However, we have no choice
but to accept their help.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.057 position:50% align:center
Agreed, we must.

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:45.145 position:50% align:center
Since Princess Scarlet has
chosen to trust the Black Edge,

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center
we unfortunately
cannot ignore them.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
But, Father!

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.777 position:50% align:center
The decision has
already been made.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:55.822 position:50% align:center
We'll dispose of the Black Edge
once the Demons are gone.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.241 position:50% align:center
Until then, be patient.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:07.667 position:50% align:center
Oh. Ah, I forgot the drinks.

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
Guess I have to
go back for them.

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.629 position:50% align:center
You go on without me.

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.089 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
[TAMM] Good afternoon.
How much for this?

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:30.774 position:50% align:center
[BAKER]
Hey, you're with the guys

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.442 position:50% align:center
who took out the Demons, right?

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:33.985 position:50% align:center
[TAMM grunts]

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:37.405 position:50% align:center
[BAKER] Hang on. Let me
get something for ya.

00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
A little thank you gift.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.701 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Uh. Uh...

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
Heh. You heard the man,
go on and take it.

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:50.543 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:01.346 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
What is this?

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50% align:center
They've totally changed
their attitude towards us.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
I guess it's not so bad
getting free stuff.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
What the hell do you guys want?

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
[HOODED MAN B]
Heh.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
Don't cause any trouble in town.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
[HOODED MAN D chuckles]

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Who are you?

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:43.763 position:50% align:center
We'll chase you dark
elves out of our town.

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:45.849 position:50% align:center
You lot are nothin' but trouble!

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
[HOODED MAN B] It's our job
to exterminate you dirty rats!

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
[HOODED MAN C]
You bastard!

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:21.468 position:50% align:center
[HOODED MAN B]
Let's go!

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
Cowards!

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:27.932 position:50% align:center
[AZAL]
Are you okay?

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:32.062 position:50% align:center
[AZAL]
You have a fever!

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.855 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
What happened?

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.441 position:50% align:center
You're hurt. Are you okay?

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
There.

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
I'll get a doctor!

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.117 position:50% align:center
Don't bother with that.

00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
He's hurt!

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:51.289 position:50% align:center
We are well aware that our kind
are not welcome in this town.

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:54.209 position:50% align:center
I'm not lookin' to cause
a commotion here.

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
Are you okay to walk, Tamm?

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:57.671 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Yeah.

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
[AZAL]
Here, let me help you.

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:09.265 position:50% align:center
[AZAL]
Why didn't you say anything?

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50% align:center
You had a fever!

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.060 position:50% align:center
[TAMM]
Heh. Sorry.

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:13.478 position:50% align:center
You're hopeless.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.939 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed you
didn't fight them Tamm.

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
If you had drawn your
weapon to fight them,

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
it most certainly would
have caused a huge scene.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.237 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center
When they first attacked,
they called me a dirty rat,

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:28.076 position:50% align:center
but after they ran away, I would
say they were the dirty rats.

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:30.537 position:50% align:center
[ZIERRO]
There are some dirty rats

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
scurrying about the town lately.

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:38.211 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE]
Tamm needs to rest.

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
[ZUCCA]
I'll carry him up to bed.

00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:41.423 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
Thank you.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:45.802 position:50% align:center
Who are these guys
who attacked Tamm today?

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
Once we find out who they are,

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.973 position:50% align:center
we're goin' after them
to take 'em out!

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:51.182 position:50% align:center
You can't.

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:53.226 position:50% align:center
If you do, we could all
be sentenced to death.

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:54.936 position:50% align:center
[BLACK EDGE MEMBERS gasp]

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center
Are you saying we can't
do anything about this?

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE]
Yes, exactly.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:11.077 position:50% align:center
So you think that
Zierro sent those men?

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
That's my guess, based
on what they called him.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.624 position:50% align:center
It's him. But we need proof.

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:19.919 position:50% align:center
Zierro is one of Princess
Scarlet's potential suitors.

00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
He is always looking for
ways to get her attention.

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.758 position:50% align:center
Perhaps he's jealous
the princess

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.551 position:50% align:center
has taken a liking to you.

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:29.512 position:50% align:center
His father is quite
a timid man... heh...

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:32.307 position:50% align:center
...but I find the son to be
quite bold, wouldn't you agree?

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.141 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:34.726 position:50% align:center
Whatever his reasons may be,

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:38.355 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt that he's hoping
to chase us out of Orvelia.

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:42.108 position:50% align:center
If he succeeds, that would
be bad for you, wouldn't it?

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
How troublesome.

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:47.864 position:50% align:center
I will discuss this
with the other nobles.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.074 position:50% align:center
In the meantime,

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
you investigate him
and find some evidence.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center
Behl told me about the attack.
Is your friend all right?

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:04.673 position:50% align:center
Yes. He is doing
fine now, thank you.

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.051 position:50% align:center
We should be thanking
the Black Edge

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
for your help
against the Demons.

00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:12.806 position:50% align:center
You have my sincerest apologies

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:14.474 position:50% align:center
that this happened
to your people.

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:15.975 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
[ZIERRO]
Princess Scarlet, excuse me.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:23.858 position:50% align:center
There are papers that require
your signature immediately.

00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:25.360 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:28.029 position:50% align:center
I heard you had some
trouble yesterday.

00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
Don't you think you should
go look after your friend

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
instead of loitering
around here?

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
[SCARLET] Yes, you should check
on him. You are dismissed.

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:37.580 position:50% align:center
Princess.

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:47.716 position:50% align:center
Huh? Welcome back, brother.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.134 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
How is Tamm doing?

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:50.510 position:50% align:center
He's doing much better.

00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
Azal and Zucca are taking
turns caring for him.

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:55.390 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
What's this?

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:01.438 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE] They took that from
the humans who attacked Tamm.

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:09.446 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE gasps]

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:10.947 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:26.504 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.675 position:50% align:center
[ZIERRO]
What's going on?

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:32.093 position:50% align:center
[ZIERRO gasps]

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.142 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:54.032 position:50% align:center
Ah! Go away!

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
You recognize this, don't you?

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
Uh, so what?

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:15.095 position:50% align:center
You sent those men
to attack my friend.

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
N-No. No, I didn't.

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:18.390 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
you're talking about!

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
But I swear you'll
regret threatening me!

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
O-Okay! It was me!
I sent them!

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
No, stop it! No, don't!

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:41.121 position:50% align:center
Wait! Please, stop!

00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:43.998 position:50% align:center
I promise I won't ever let him
do something stupid again!

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:45.959 position:50% align:center
I beg you, forgive him!

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET] Stay away from
me and my friends.

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
We understand!

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you going after
them for me. Thank you.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:10.442 position:50% align:center
I believe they won't be
causing us any more trouble.

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
In fact, I think they'll
be more cooperative.

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I'm not
satisfied at all.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:18.074 position:50% align:center
I still want to hunt
down those humans

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
that hurt Tamm and kill them!

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
And this is why we didn't
bring you along with us.

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:25.165 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:29.753 position:50% align:center
That said, I think there
are some humans in Orvelia

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:31.296 position:50% align:center
who have a good heart.

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
Oh, I just meant, the princess--
what's her name, Scarlet?

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
Riheet mentioned that
she actually apologized

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
for what happened to me.

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:42.140 position:50% align:center
I really can't believe a
princess would do that.

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.725 position:50% align:center
Don't be dumb.

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.311 position:50% align:center
You forget that while our
families were being murdered,

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
the princess had a nice, easy
life growing up in the castle.

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
She's no different from
those rotten nobles.

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:55.195 position:50% align:center
We cannot trust
the people of Orvelia.

00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:58.114 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I know.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.002 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE] It's more red
than usual tonight.

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:12.087 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
It is.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.338 position:50% align:center
I don't know why,

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:16.341 position:50% align:center
but looking at that moon
always calms my mind.

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE crying]

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.598 position:50% align:center
Don't cry, Ripine.

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center
Those Orvelian humans
enjoy hurting us.

00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:27.644 position:50% align:center
They don't deserve your tears.

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:30.522 position:50% align:center
Crying just gives them
exactly what they want.

00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:31.898 position:50% align:center
But I--

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center
Hold your head high,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.027 position:50% align:center
then your tears won't
be able to fall.

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:40.740 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:45.036 --> 00:20:48.873 position:50% align:center
One day, I will avenge
our mother, I promise you.

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
[RIPINE] Brother, we're so
close to reaching our goal.

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
[RIHEET]
Yes.

00:22:44.114 --> 00:22:46.324 position:50% align:center
You've finally awakened.

00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:48.785 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK]
Hello, Maria.

00:22:48.868 --> 00:22:52.163 position:50% align:center
The Day of Lea
swiftly approaches.

00:22:53.456 --> 00:22:56.084 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's time for us to
bring back the Dark Lord,

00:22:56.167 --> 00:22:57.627 position:50% align:center
right, Malduk?

00:22:57.711 --> 00:23:02.507 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK] Of course. And what
about the Holy Sword Aea?

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.802 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I searched everywhere,
but couldn't find it.

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:09.180 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK] We need it before
we bring the Dark Lord back.

00:23:09.264 --> 00:23:11.349 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:23:41.087 --> 00:23:45.842 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK] Now, it's time for
the exciting banquet to begin!

00:23:46.885 --> 00:23:48.345 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
We stop in a small town

00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:51.598 position:50% align:center
and meet a young girl
all on her own.

00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:53.433 position:50% align:center
After losing her parents,

00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:57.145 position:50% align:center
this little girl, Elise,
struggles with her grief.

00:23:57.228 --> 00:24:00.815 position:50% align:center
In her eyes, I see
a familiar emotion.
