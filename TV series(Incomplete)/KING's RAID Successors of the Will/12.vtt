[NARRATOR]
One hundred years have passed

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.016 position:50% align:center
since the Battle
of Galluah Plains,

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.519 position:50% align:center
where King Kyle defeated
the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:22.689 position:50% align:center
The Demons rise again,
threatening the world,

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.942 position:50% align:center
spreading fear
and unrest to all.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:29.237 position:50% align:center
Kasel and his friends
arrive at Ogria Mountain

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.322 position:50% align:center
where they learn
that Master Aeatola

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center
passed away many years ago.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.705 position:50% align:center
The current orc chief, Sieg,
sends Kasel to the Holy Shrine.

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
There, he will be tested
to prove he is the true heir

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.586 position:50% align:center
to the Holy Sword.

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:47.380 position:50% align:center
Your friends will be
held here as hostages.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
If the ancestral
spirits determine

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.218 position:50% align:center
that you are not the
heir to the Holy Sword,

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:56.556 position:50% align:center
you and your friends
will all be put to death!

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.574 position:50% align:center
So this is the Holy Shrine.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.368 position:50% align:center
Only those chosen are
allowed to go any further

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:42.287 position:50% align:center
than the entrance to this cave.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.122 position:50% align:center
This shrine is a sacred place

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:47.000 position:50% align:center
where orc shamans are
trained and tested.

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.002 position:50% align:center
Deep inside,
you'll find an altar

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.129 position:50% align:center
where the test will
be given to you.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50% align:center
I wish you luck.
May your heart be strong.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.467 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.729 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] They didn't even
take away my staff.

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.731 position:50% align:center
Are you sure we're prisoners?

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:12.942 position:50% align:center
They must really think that they
can take us down at any time.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.819 position:50% align:center
We aren't viewed as a threat.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:17.155 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Hmm.

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:19.240 position:50% align:center
This place is nice.

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:22.786 position:50% align:center
I mean, once all the commotion
died down, it was peaceful.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:26.206 position:50% align:center
Are orcs always so aggressive?
Even when Demons aren't around?

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.293 position:50% align:center
Maybe they're not
always this intense.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.879 position:50% align:center
Or they're waiting
for Kasel to fail.

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50% align:center
Why are you guys so quiet?

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.759 position:50% align:center

[gasps]

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
That must be the altar.

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:05.995 position:50% align:center
[ORC SPIRIT A]
Who goes there?

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center

Show us your heart.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.297 position:50% align:center

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center

you up for breakfast.

Come on over here and eat.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50% align:center

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
I made a lot, so eat up!

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.450 position:50% align:center
Will do!

It's so beautiful out today,
how about we go for a walk?

[ORC D]
There's no way that puny human

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:35.210 position:50% align:center
is the heir to the Holy Sword!

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
And the way he talked back
to Chief Sieg like that

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.005 position:50% align:center
was so disrespectful!

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.966 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'd love to slice him up!

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.677 position:50% align:center

How barbaric.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.679 position:50% align:center

to come back anyway.

hope this test isn't hard.

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:28.169 position:50% align:center
I told you, you don't have
to think about anything here.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:29.587 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.756 position:50% align:center
No!

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:38.930 position:50% align:center
It's wrong, because...
Mom, I know you're--

00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:41.433 position:50% align:center
Mom, I know that you're dead!

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50% align:center
That's too bad.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
If only you hadn't remembered,

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
then you could've
stayed here with me.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:55.530 position:50% align:center
No, I couldn't.
I can't. I have to go.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:59.242 position:50% align:center
[ARLETTE] We could start over
from the day you lost me.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
Pretend none of those
things happened.

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
Pretend it didn't happen?

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:09.002 position:50% align:center
Yes. That our village
wasn't attacked by Demons.

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:11.546 position:50% align:center
In here, nothing
can make you sad.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
And of course, your
mother is still alive.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
You can always be with me.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:20.347 position:50% align:center
So, wouldn't you prefer this?

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.391 position:50% align:center
Stay here with me.

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:27.062 position:50% align:center
Stay with here with me and
we can just be happy together.

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
But... But I...

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:32.233 position:50% align:center
Forget it. Who cares
about the Holy Sword?

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
What?

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:34.944 position:50% align:center
Just let go of this
burden of fate

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
you hold on to all by yourself.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.366 position:50% align:center
But I'm not burdened
by this fate.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
That may be true,

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:43.411 position:50% align:center
but deep down, I know there
are things that you hate

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
about this world.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
If only there were no Demons,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.709 position:50% align:center
if only your mother
had survived,

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:53.004 position:50% align:center
then none of these things
would've happened to you, right?

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
That's not true.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
If you weren't the heir
to the Holy Sword,

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.135 position:50% align:center
then you wouldn't be
forced to fight Demons.

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't need to
watch as people die.

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
You don't need to
suffer anymore.

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:09.187 position:50% align:center
You've been through a lot.
I'm proud of you.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center
But you deserve some
happiness as well.

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
Stay here and I'll
take care of you.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
I can't do that.

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.865 position:50% align:center
I know that, right now,
the Demons are still out there,

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:24.202 position:50% align:center
and if I don't stop them,
more people will suffer.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.578 position:50% align:center
No matter what,

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:29.082 position:50% align:center
I have to unlock the Holy
Sword to protect them.

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
Wait, Kasel.

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
If you choose to leave here,

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:40.385 position:50% align:center
then you will
never see me again.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
I don't want to leave,

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
but I can't lose anyone
else important to me.

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
I have to go. I'm sorry.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:51.980 position:50% align:center
My friends, they're
waiting for me.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.402 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Goodbye... Mother.

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:07.537 position:50% align:center
[AEATOLA]
Heir of the Holy Sword.

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:11.583 position:50% align:center
[AEATOLA]
My name is Aeatola.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.043 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Master Aeatola.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
[AEATOLA] I commend you for
overcoming your illusion.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:18.006 position:50% align:center
An illusion?

00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:20.300 position:50% align:center
[AEATOLA]
This shrine is special.

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:24.429 position:50% align:center
Orc shamans use it to test
the hearts of their trainees.

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.307 position:50% align:center
They're shown a world
of their heart's desire.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.686 position:50% align:center
Only if they give up what is
offered can one pass the test.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.856 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
So, all of that was fake?

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.149 position:50% align:center
Even my mother?

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:38.485 position:50% align:center
[AEATOLA] The human
heart is often weak,

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
unable to say no to
their deepest desires.

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:44.866 position:50% align:center
If you were not as
strong as you are,

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:45.950 position:50% align:center
you would have been trapped

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:49.245 position:50% align:center
in the illusion you
created forever.

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:52.999 position:50% align:center
The fate of the world
rests in your hands.

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:55.085 position:50% align:center
I wish you luck.

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
[CLEO] Oh, I knew it.
I'm a super genius.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
[ORC D] Master Kaulah
has finally returned!

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
[ORC E]
And the human is with him!

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.584 position:50% align:center
You're back!

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:39.170 position:50% align:center
Hey, you made it.
Took you long enough.

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:40.880 position:50% align:center
You were asleep the whole time.

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
No, I wasn't!

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
We tried to wake you,

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.803 position:50% align:center
but the whole time,
you just talked in your sleep.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.680 position:50% align:center
You know that you're only
slightly less annoying

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
when you're sleeping.

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.937 position:50% align:center
I get no respect.

00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:58.815 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center
We have returned.
The test was successful.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.620 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Here's the seal.

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
Fellow orcs, I have
an announcement!

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
This talisman is indeed
the one Chief Aeatola

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:24.007 position:50% align:center
left behind for the heir.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.092 position:50% align:center
[ORC D]
So he is the one!

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:29.095 position:50% align:center
It's time.

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?
I'll unlock the seal.

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:35.226 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.978 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:08.593 position:50% align:center
Hold on, did you feel
something amazing this time?

00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
Well, no. Not really.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center
What? But now you've
unlocked two holy seals.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:15.975 position:50% align:center
You're close to having
the full power,

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:17.560 position:50% align:center
it should've felt
like something!

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:20.355 position:50% align:center
Maybe, "Boom!" or a,
"Wah!" or something!

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:23.066 position:50% align:center
You know, a lot of
power flowing into you!

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.318 position:50% align:center
I really don't feel anything.

00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:27.487 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Man, this is such a letdown.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.781 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry about that.

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:39.374 position:50% align:center
What is this?
That pulse of power.

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:41.543 position:50% align:center
Could it be...?

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
[SIEG] I don't know what
you saw or experienced

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.635 position:50% align:center
in the test at the shrine,

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
but I hope you remember
what happened there.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.514 position:50% align:center
[KASEL]
Huh?

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:57.142 position:50% align:center
The test was originally
created for orc shamans

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:58.476 position:50% align:center
during their training.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
Though I have never
taken the test myself,

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:01.980 position:50% align:center
I am told it is difficult

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:05.233 position:50% align:center
and challenges the deepest
parts of your heart.

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:06.985 position:50% align:center
It does.

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center
Remember these parts
of you that are weak.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:14.075 position:50% align:center
Use them to make yourself
a stronger warrior.

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:17.037 position:50% align:center
You are the heir
to the Holy Sword.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.914 position:50% align:center
But more importantly,
you are a hero!

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:22.751 position:50% align:center
You will take to the
front lines and fight!

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
Just like the one who
owned the sword before,

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:27.714 position:50% align:center
the legendary King Kyle!

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
Just like my father.

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.844 position:50% align:center
One hundred years ago,
the orcs fought alongside him

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:35.305 position:50% align:center
in the difficult battle
against the Demons.

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.974 position:50% align:center
Chief Aeatola was the one
who led our tribe.

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center
We have nothing but respect
towards those warriors

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:44.147 position:50% align:center
who fought in the Great War
against the Dark Lord Angmund.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
As you are aware,

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
King Kyle did not fight against
the threat on his own

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
and many fought to
take down the evil.

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
Now we plan to do the same.

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:57.035 position:50% align:center
When you call for us and
you hold the Holy Sword,

00:17:57.118 --> 00:18:01.581 position:50% align:center
I will fight by your side,
on my honor as a warrior.

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:07.420 position:50% align:center
And now, go forth and fight to
bring honor to the Holy Sword.

00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
I will.

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:10.340 position:50% align:center
I wish you luck, all of you,

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:13.426 position:50% align:center
and be safe on the rest
of your journey.

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:19.557 position:50% align:center
Identify yourself!

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:21.434 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK]
Where is Aea's sword?

00:18:21.518 --> 00:18:22.936 position:50% align:center
Stay back!

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:30.193 position:50% align:center
I know I felt the
Holy Sword's power.

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
A black-haired human male.

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:35.031 position:50% align:center
Are you the sorcerer
they spoke of?

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:39.035 position:50% align:center
It's him. The human who
stole our fallen friends.

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:42.539 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK laughing]

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:44.165 position:50% align:center
Me, human?

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:47.127 position:50% align:center
I'm on a different level
than those creatures!

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.586 position:50% align:center
I am Malduk.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.631 position:50% align:center
I am the sorcerer who
brings corpses back to life.

00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:53.633 position:50% align:center
I can raise the dead!

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:56.678 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:57.971 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're the sorcerer

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.640 position:50% align:center
who summoned the Dark
Lord 100 years ago?

00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:02.559 position:50% align:center
You're that Malduk?

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.479 position:50% align:center
[SIEG] You'll pay for
what you have done!

00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:10.108 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:13.278 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Chief Sieg!

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center
You're still alive after that?

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:24.205 position:50% align:center
[DALE]
How dare you attack our chief!

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
How boring. Is that
all you had in you?

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:45.226 position:50% align:center
[KASEL] I'll kill him!
I'll take him out now!

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
Let's go help him!

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:48.021 position:50% align:center
--[FREY] Yes!
--[CLEO] Obviously!

[yells]

00:19:57.572 --> 00:20:01.826 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK] I've found it.
The power is coming from you.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
How annoying.

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:24.849 position:50% align:center
You sliced my--

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:28.019 position:50% align:center
You sliced off my hair!

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:31.773 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
Frey!

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
Frey!

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
[MALDUK] Just a simple human.
No match for a god like me.

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
Do you hate me now?

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:51.001 position:50% align:center
Hate this horrible world?
Hate your weak self?

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
I love seeing humans succumb
to hate--it's so beautiful!

00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:04.889 position:50% align:center
What the--? He's so
much stronger now.

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:09.728 position:50% align:center
[KASEL yells]

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:16.359 position:50% align:center
I thank the gods you're alive.

00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:21.448 position:50% align:center
Please, stop him.

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:40.342 position:50% align:center
[KASEL yells]

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
This is the--

00:21:57.609 --> 00:21:59.194 position:50% align:center
[CLEO]
We're coming!

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.949 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kasel. Wake up!

00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:06.618 position:50% align:center
Can you hear me?

00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:10.163 position:50% align:center
Be okay.

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:13.208 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
Kasel.

00:23:46.801 --> 00:23:48.386 position:50% align:center
[FREY]
During his fight with Malduk,

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.223 position:50% align:center
Kasel unleashes an overwhelming
power we haven't seen before.

00:23:52.307 --> 00:23:56.102 position:50% align:center
He is knocked unconscious
and we are unable to wake him.

00:23:56.186 --> 00:24:00.607 position:50% align:center
I wish I could protect him.
What should I do, Clause?
