1
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,327
Who is there?

2
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,865
Cobra, still on the run
from the government, huh?

3
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,368
My name is Katsura,
not Cobra.

4
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,704
What are you doing
here anyway?

5
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,273
I heard you escaped from
the government's pursuit

6
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,442
and were laying low
in Kyoto.

7
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,844
I couldn't resist
returning after hearing

8
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,513
there was a festival
going on, so here I am.

9
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,517
Better keep that love of festivals
of yours under control.

10
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,120
The Government hates you
even more than they hate me.

11
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,222
You'll get yourself killed.

12
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,291
There is no way in hell
I would miss a festival

13
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,094
that the Shogun himself
is going to attend, Cobra.

14
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,563
And how do you know
that he will be there?

15
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,064
You're not gonna...?

16
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,469
I don't intend to do
anything that outrageous,

17
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,638
but that sure sounds
exciting, doesn't it?

18
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,742
But of course, if the Shogun's head
were to fly during the festival,

19
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,043
the Shogun Government

20
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,879
and this entire country
would lose their shit.

21
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,257
Hey, you old geezer!

22
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,826
Hiraga, you bastard,
get out here right now!

23
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,294
Do you have any idea
how much trouble

24
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,864
you've caused everyone in
this neighborhood, do you?

25
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,800
The sound of machinery and
clanging metal day and night!

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,702
Are you some kind of
Robot Warrior or something?

27
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,872
I don't give a damn if you're
the top inventor in Edo City!

28
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,473
You build nothing but junk.

29
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,810
The Kabukicho Neighborhood
Association has had it with you!

30
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,115
All right, you three.

31
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,450
You can go in and get him!

32
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,899
First up, from Kabukicho
Neighborhood, it's Shinpachi Shimura!

33
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,367
Your father is Bleep Bleep!

34
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,268
What?

35
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,609
<i>♪Your father is Bleep Bleep!♪</i>

36
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,279
<i>♪Your father is Bleep Bleep!♪</i>

37
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,015
<i>♪Your father is Bleep Bleep!♪</i>

38
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:35,849
Good lord!

39
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,751
I said for you
to stop the noise!

40
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,820
What is this?
You're making it worse!

41
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,288
The two God awful noises

42
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,424
are actually starting
to harmonize together!

43
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,194
The best way to handle a bully
is to bully him right back,

44
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,228
don't you know?

45
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,729
A guy who's never been punched

46
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,566
doesn't understand the pain
and suffering of others.

47
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,634
You're the one
who doesn't understand pain!

48
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,970
My eardrums are about
to explode from this!

49
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,905
What are you talking about,
old lady?

50
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,941
Shinpachi is the one
who's really suffering.

51
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,410
He's showing off in public
how he can't sing at all.

52
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,346
Looks to me like
he's having a blast!

53
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,182
Shinpachi, let me sing
the next song.

54
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,219
I bought the latest song by
Luciano Paparazzi with me.

55
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,019
Come on.

56
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,188
Hey, are you even
listening to me?

57
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,625
‐What?!
‐Cut it out! This is my one...

58
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:19,960
Oh, man.

59
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,295
What are they doing?
This is all wrong.

60
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,564
Hey, I'm the one singing next!

61
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,033
What did you people
come here to do?

62
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:27,768
<i>Forget it.</i>

63
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,336
<i>If I have to listen</i>
<i>to you guys sing,</i>

64
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,238
<i>I'd rather sing myself!</i>

65
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,139
<i>‐No one wants to hear...</i>
<i>‐Give me that!</i>

66
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,507
<i>...your stinking singing!</i>

67
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,976
<i>‐Just keep quiet, you rotten old hag!</i>
<i>‐How dare you?</i>

68
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,311
<i>How about a duet then,</i>
<i>damn you!</i>

69
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,516
What?

70
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,385
This is Hiraga, then, uh?

71
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,722
‐Stop, stop, stop, stop!
‐Stop, stop, stop, stop!

72
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:49,689
My head is coming off!

73
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,258
I said my head
is coming off, Hiraga!

74
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,592
Stop it, Hiraga!

75
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:53,793
You idiots!

76
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,395
I am the one called Hiraga.

77
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,997
You brats are making
a terrible racket

78
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,732
right out in front
of my house.

79
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,935
Think about all the trouble that
you're causing in the neighborhood!

80
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,238
You're the troublemaker,
you old geezer!

81
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,506
That incredible racket
you're making

82
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,743
is driving everyone in the
neighborhood clickety clackety crazy!

83
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,779
I don't ever recall making a racket
that went clickety clack!

84
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,247
It's clackety click!

85
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,184
Hiraga, listen, you're not
a young man anymore,

86
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,219
so try to live
in peace and quiet.

87
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,422
You intend to have those wind up toys
look after you in retirement?

88
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,857
Shut up, you old hag!

89
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,525
I don't care how many times
you come in.

90
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,727
I'm not closing up the shop!
Go home!

91
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,329
Hey, Saburo, don't hold back.

92
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,897
Force all of these idiots out!

93
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,332
<i>Affirmative.</i>

94
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,034
Hey, what... what...?

95
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,102
Stop, stop!

96
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,408
Wow, It's a mountain of robots.

97
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,077
Did you actually make
all of these robots, Hiraga?

98
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,312
What do you you guys
think you're doing,

99
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,414
packing up my stuff
without my permission?

100
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,616
Damn it!
Untie these ropes!

101
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,419
‐Hey, go get me some tea.
<i>‐Affirmative.</i>

102
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,453
Saburo!

103
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,188
Why are you working
like their servant?

104
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,189
Come and help me!

105
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,926
Oh, boy, you sure make
truly good stuff, old man.

106
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,696
Can I get one of these helpful
tin cans for myself?

107
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,864
Hot diggity!

108
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,834
Serves you right!

109
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,837
Saburo can understand human
languages to a certain extent.

110
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,373
He responds to people
who use aggressive words

111
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,009
or actions with his
equally aggressive iron fists.

112
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,945
Okay, release me from
these ropes right now!

113
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,580
Hurry up, you bucket of bolts!

114
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:27,320
Hey, Otose, is that man really
the top inventor in all of Edo City?

115
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,689
Well, that's what I hear.

116
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,759
But to us, it all just looks
like junk, you know.

117
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,695
It's not junk at all!

118
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,431
Creating something is like
materializing your soul

119
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,800
into something that exists
in reality.

120
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,737
These robots and machines
are all my beloved sons.

121
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,506
Your son's tangled up
over there with a delinquent.

122
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,610
‐Nooo!
‐No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

123
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,646
<i>‐Rocket Punch Fire!</i>
<i>‐Stop it, no!</i>

124
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:53,913
<i>He can't do that!</i>

125
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,882
<i>You're just tearing</i>
<i>his arms off!</i>

126
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,332
That should do it.
There!

127
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,768
You can make as much noise
as you like out here.

128
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,902
Go crazy.

129
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,438
All the noise that I want?

130
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,540
But my robots
are all broken to bits.

131
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,809
What have you bastards done?

132
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,544
Don't worry at all.

133
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,745
Sabu is okay.

134
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,580
‐Affirmative.
‐Don't "Affirmative" me!

135
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,515
It looks different!

136
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,983
You're missing the arms!

137
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:30,917
Your arms!

138
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,752
What am I going to do?

139
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,954
I won't be able to finish
in time for the festival!

140
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,755
‐Festival?
‐Festival?

141
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,091
In three days,
there's going to be a festival

142
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,592
to commemorate
the 20th anniversary

143
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,561
of the country's opening
to the Amanto.

144
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,164
Even the Shogun is going to make
a rare public appearance.

145
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,032
I have direct orders
from the Government

146
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,435
to have my robots
perform at the ceremony.

147
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,803
What am I going to do?

148
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,906
If I don't finish in time,
I'll have to commit harakiri!

149
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,709
Oh yeah, I forgot that I had
some curry simmering at home.

150
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,077
‐Must run.
‐Hey!

151
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,546
Give me back Saburo's arms!

152
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,848
Darn those stupid kids!

153
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,249
They're all crazy.

154
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,352
Are you going to be
all right, Hiraga?

155
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,087
Oh, I've got no choice, do I?

156
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,955
If I work around the clock,
I might...

157
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:09,756
Not that.

158
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,558
I was talking about your son.

159
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,829
If I'm not mistaken,
wasn't the Shogunate...?

160
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,032
Otose, the trick for an
old man to live a long life

161
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,668
is to quickly forget about
anything he doesn't like.

162
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:26,373
And I've told you before,
this robot is my son now.

163
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,543
<i>Hey, dad!</i>
<i>Hey, dad, please stop!</i>

164
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,147
<i>What good will making robots</i>
<i>for murdering people do?</i>

165
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,950
<i>Dad, didn't you say that you wanted</i>
<i>robots to help people?</i>

166
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,284
<i>Didn't you say that?</i>

167
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,787
<i>But now it is the time,</i>
<i>the time to change.</i>

168
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,055
<i>If things remain as they are,</i>

169
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,524
<i>this country will be taken over</i>
<i>by the Sky people.</i>

170
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,761
<i>This is the only thing that</i>
<i>I can do to try to stop them now.</i>

171
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,231
<i>Alright, dad, then I'm going</i>
<i>to fight instead.</i>

172
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,600
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

173
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,570
<i>Listen, dad, I noticed that</i>
<i>you stopped smiling a long time ago.</i>

174
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,906
<i>You know, dad...</i>

175
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,008
<i>I loved watching you work,</i>

176
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,512
<i>working happily on your robots</i>
<i>all covered in grease,</i>

177
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,081
<i>looking exactly like a little kid</i>
<i>playing in the mud.</i>

178
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,184
<i>So I have decided.</i>

179
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,585
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to see you working</i>

180
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,855
<i>with such a grim look</i>
<i>on your face anymore.</i>

181
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,390
<i>Hey, wait up!</i>

182
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,691
<i>Wait, Saburo!</i>

183
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,100
<i>Listen up.</i>

184
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,067
<i>On the day of the festival,</i>

185
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,070
<i>the Shinsengumi will protect</i>
<i>the Shogun</i>

186
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,905
<i>with every last man</i>
<i>in our ranks.</i>

187
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,941
If the Shogun so much as gets
even a single scratch on him,

188
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,544
then the heads of every
last one of us will roll!

189
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,846
I want you to keep
that in mind, alright?

190
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,882
If you see anyone suspicious,
kill them without hesitation!

191
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,751
I'll take full responsibility.

192
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,085
Are you for real, sir?

193
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,855
In this case, I'll start by killing
every samurai in sight.

194
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,490
I appreciate this opportunity.

195
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,658
Okay, guys!

196
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,060
Please just disregard
that last order.

197
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,632
Also, although this intelligence
is still unconfirmed

198
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:03,069
we have information that someone
really dangerous is in Edo City.

199
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,637
Someone really dangerous?

200
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,172
Who could that be, huh?

201
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,943
Remember that incident where
over a dozen government officials

202
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,679
got assassinated during
a dinner meeting?

203
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,148
Well, that was his work.

204
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:22,522
<i>The most radical and dangerous man</i>
<i>among all the Exclusionist Rebels.</i>

205
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,361
<i>His name is Shinsuke Takasugi.</i>

206
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:54,020
<i>‐Let's invite Yo too!</i>
<i>‐Yeah.</i>

207
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,323
This sweet, seductive
smell must be...

208
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,359
cotton candy!

209
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,161
Cotton candy!

210
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,729
Ah, damn!

211
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,533
Quit playing around
and get back to work!

212
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,935
We are very short
on time as it is!

213
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:12,205
But listen, Hiraga, the festival
has already begun.

214
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,473
I mean, we came
to help you,

215
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,742
but I still don't think
we're going to make it.

216
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,077
The robot performance
doesn't start until tonight.

217
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,913
If we can somehow
finish by this evening,

218
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,147
we'll manage just fine.

219
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,549
Don't try to play
dumb with me!

220
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:23,917
Look at at this!

221
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,051
You think I wouldn't know

222
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,053
about this shirt having lipstick
all over it?!

223
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,322
Look here, don't think
that you can lie to me anymore!

224
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,658
Tell me exactly
where this came from!

225
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:32,725
<i>Affirmative.</i>

226
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,726
"Affirmative, affirmative."

227
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,128
That's all you ever say!

228
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,630
That's why your subordinates
all look down on you!

229
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,634
Try saying "no", for a change,
or you'll never be promoted!

230
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,435
<i>Affirmative.</i>

231
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,338
Ah... that's it!

232
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:46,806
‐Domestic Violence!
‐What are you doing?!

233
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:47,874
Stop that!

234
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,275
<i>Who is she?!</i>

235
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,410
<i>It's that girl, isn't it?</i>

236
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,879
<i>That ugly, witch who came</i>
<i>to our housewarming party!</i>

237
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,113
<i>Stop it, I said!</i>

238
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,049
<i>What sort of sick soap opera</i>
<i>are you playing at?</i>

239
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,050
<i>It might be playing to you,</i>

240
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,152
<i>but to me, it meant</i>
<i>everything in the world.</i>

241
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,220
<i>You just don't understand!</i>

242
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,458
We somehow managed
to finish on time.

243
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,727
Although there are
a couple kinks left unsorted.

244
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,228
If you guys hadn't shown up,

245
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,731
I wouldn't have had any problems
getting finished at all.

246
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,001
Get off your pedestal,
you aging public hazard!

247
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:18,004
We only came because
that old hag forced us to.

248
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,607
I still have some
final adjustments to make.

249
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,674
You'll only get in the way,

250
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,743
so go check out
the festival or something.

251
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,378
Gintoki, hurry, hurry!

252
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,913
Thank you, Hiraga!

253
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,016
They sure are a rowdy bunch,
aren't they?

254
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:30,883
Right, Sabu...?

255
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,018
Saburo!

256
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,853
Hey, you can't go with them!

257
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,388
Saburo, stop!

258
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,863
Wow, let's eat fried udon next!

259
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:48,468
How odd. It almost looks as
if Saburo is having fun too.

260
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,571
Well, the truth is anything's
more fun than hanging out

261
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,806
with a grim faced
old geezer like you.

262
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,476
Hey, you say the same thing
that my son did.

263
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,444
Wait, your son?
You had a son?

264
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,445
I didn't know that.

265
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,481
I did, but he is gone now.

266
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,617
He went off to war
on his own and he died.

267
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,187
He loved robots every bit
as much as I do.

268
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,291
A brat who would sneak in to tinker
with all of my machines.

269
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,059
<i>When I think back now,</i>

270
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,995
<i>that must have been the happiest</i>
<i>time of my entire life.</i>

271
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,564
<i>Back then I tinkered with robots</i>
<i>because I loved them.</i>

272
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,534
<i>But then ever since people started</i>
<i>calling me the greatest inventor</i>

273
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,236
<i>in Edo City and such,</i>

274
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,638
<i>robots just became</i>
<i>a means to an end.</i>

275
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,941
<i>That son of mine rebelled</i>
<i>against me for that and left me.</i>

276
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,411
<i>And that was it.</i>

277
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,848
And that reminds me...
I heard something.

278
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,818
I heard from Otose that
you also went to war as well.

279
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,454
It's not anything for me
to be proud of.

280
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,025
I lost a lot of friends
during that time.

281
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,062
Don't you ever want
to avenge their deaths?

282
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,898
Haven't you ever thought of
striking back at the Government

283
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,133
and the Amanto for
the friends you've lost?

284
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,968
Old man, you're not thinking....?

285
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,070
Oh, shoot!

286
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,039
I have some final adjustments to make,
so I'm heading back now.

287
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,442
Hey, Saburo, let's go.

288
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,082
Oh, it's that old dude.

289
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,584
Oh no, it's that girl
with the venomous tongue!

290
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,519
Oh, if it isn't Hasegawa!

291
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,154
You finally found a job!

292
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,723
Congratulations!

293
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,057
Oh, thank you!

294
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,726
How are you two doing?
Are you on a date?

295
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,495
A shooting game?

296
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,363
Maybe I'll have a try at it.

297
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,965
Oh, go ahead,
go ahead, go ahead!

298
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:26,966
It's on me!

299
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,402
If I hit it, will you give me
anything that I want?

300
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,137
Sure, I'll give it to you.

301
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,240
Take good aim and...

302
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,411
‐Hand over your shades.
‐What?

303
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,512
You did it wrong.

304
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,947
You were supposed
to aim that way.

305
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,217
I just won that nice watch.

306
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,384
Now just a minute!

307
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,619
Wait a minute!
Come on!

308
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,555
I said I'd give you anything,
but not my personal property!

309
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,057
Hey! Are you listening?!

310
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,893
I just won the beard.

311
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,328
I scored the jacket.

312
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,396
I'm taking the nipple!

313
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,289
Hijikata, I noticed Okita
hasn't been back at all

314
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,691
since he said that he had
to go take a dump.

315
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,394
That bastard is probably
goofing off again.

316
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,897
Hijikata, you can have
your doubt of anyone else,

317
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,566
but doubting one of our own
is not something I can approve.

318
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,201
I really believe in Okita.

319
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,937
I'm sure he's just having
a hard time getting it all out.

320
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,338
That's what I believe.

321
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,707
I think he'd rather
you just doubted him

322
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,076
if that's what you're going
to be believing of him.

323
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:47,079
But that damn Yamazaki
sure is late.

324
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,347
What happened?

325
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,983
The Shogun said he wants
to eat octopus dumplings.

326
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,985
He doesn't have a care
in the world.

327
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,954
Hey, Vice‐Chief,
sorry for the delay!

328
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,955
I've returned with your food!

329
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,123
Hey, you're late!

330
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,625
You better not have forgotten
the mayonnaise!

331
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,795
Hey... this looks like...

332
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,697
Forgive me,
I was in such a rush

333
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,732
that I tripped and
they fell out on the way back.

334
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:07,567
Forgive me, sir.

335
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,603
I, Sagaru Yamazaki,
have made a blunder I regret.

336
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,738
I see, though I think the
bits of food around your mouth

337
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,575
are a blunder you're going
to regret for the rest of your life.

338
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,610
Yamazaki!

339
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,047
Vice‐Chief, this isn't
what you think!

340
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:21,914
This is from the hot dogs...

341
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,616
‐...I ate along the way!
‐It's too late for excuses!

342
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,985
Hey, what are you
going to do?

343
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,020
You're... you're eating it?

344
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,689
Don't get so upset, Hijikata.

345
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,190
Today is a festival.

346
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,458
I can't help it.

347
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,795
That bastard Takasugi
has no political beliefs at all.

348
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,830
He only enjoys creating chaos.

349
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,265
There's no way
a guy like that

350
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:42,268
is going to overlook
a huge festival like this!

351
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:51,177
Oh! It's started. The Show by
Edo City's top robot puppeteer,

352
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,012
Gengai Hiraga!

353
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,153
<i>A festival must be loud</i>
<i>to be interesting, that's for sure.</i>

354
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,825
<i>Don't you move.</i>

355
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,296
To think the man they called
the White Knight

356
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,231
would let someone
take his six.

357
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,535
Gintoki, have you finally
lost your edge?

358
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,337
What are you doing
in a place like this, huh?

359
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,373
Just shut up
and watch, Gintoki.

360
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,875
An incredibly exciting show
is about to begin.

361
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,782
Saburo, let's do it.

362
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:30,816
<i>Affirmative.</i>

363
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,553
Fire!

364
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,559
<i>It's a terrorist attack!</i>

365
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,794
<i>It's the Exclusionist Rebels!</i>

366
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,832
Is this a smoke screen?

367
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,635
Hey men! Secure the area
around the tower.

368
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:54,373
Don't let a single rat
near the Shogun!

369
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,108
<i>It's an army of robots!</i>

370
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,979
Looks like the crowd
has made it out.

371
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,647
Okay, start it up!

372
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,451
Men, forward!

373
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:09,255
Attack!

374
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,361
So tell me,
do you remember, Gintoki,

375
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,063
how there was
that one time when I led

376
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,398
a volunteer army
called the Cavalry?

377
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,034
At that time, there was
a man named Saburo.

378
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,502
He wasn't any good
with the sword,

379
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,539
but man, he was incredibly good
with building machines.

380
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,175
<i>He said he didn't join</i>
<i>to fight a war.</i>

381
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,410
<i>He came to fight</i>
<i>for his father.</i>

382
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,646
<i>His father was</i>
<i>all he ever talked about.</i>

383
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:39,118
But then he died without ever
being able to return to his father.

384
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,254
What a sad story, right?

385
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,157
I mean we all risked our lives
to protect our country

386
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,659
from the Amanto people,

387
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,027
but our very government

388
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,696
welcomed the Amanto
without a second thought.

389
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,066
<i>Even the Cavalry</i>
<i>was no exception.</i>

390
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,569
<i>We were caught in the purge,</i>
<i>and eventually destroyed.</i>

391
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,437
<i>When he saw</i>
<i>his son's head exposed</i>

392
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,106
<i>for public viewing</i>
<i>by the riverbed,</i>

393
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,108
<i>who knows what</i>
<i>his old man thought.</i>

394
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,946
Takasugi, were you the one
who egged the old man on?

395
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,347
Egg someone on?

396
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,149
Don't be ridiculous.

397
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,684
I saw a pair
of splendid fangs,

398
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,020
so I just polished them
a little bit.

399
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,855
You see, Gintoki,

400
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,724
I understand the suffering
that old man is going through.

401
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,826
There still remains
a dark beast of vengeance

402
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,329
stirring deep down
inside me as well.

403
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,531
Thrashing about all day
and all night,

404
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,501
saying endlessly
in my ear: "Kill.

405
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,102
Kill the enemies
of my friends.

406
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,104
Make them suffer
the way we suffered."

407
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,008
Gintoki, can't you hear
those voices as well?

408
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,577
No, well, I suppose you can't.

409
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,513
Looking away from
your own past

410
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,682
and living a carefree
life these days.

411
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,384
You've lost your fangs
to indifference.

412
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,720
You couldn't understand
how we feel.

413
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,894
Your biggest mistake is
underestimating me, Takasugi.

414
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,164
I've got a beast
of my own too.

415
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:00,966
It won't move.

416
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,902
But the beast in me
is a white one.

417
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,471
And what is it's name, you ask?

418
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,173
We call him Sadaharu!

419
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,608
No way!

420
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,477
My beloved, glorious
famed blade is...!

421
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,046
Ah, Hijikata, my beloved blade...

422
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,448
‐...is no way!
‐Shut up!

423
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,083
This isn't the time for that!

424
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,485
But I'm still paying off
my loan for this.

425
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,953
‐No way!
‐Damn it.

426
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,955
We keep cutting them down,
but they keep coming back.

427
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,657
There's no end to this.

428
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,060
What was that?!

429
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,932
<i>Who are the bad boys</i>
<i>who are ruining the festival?</i>

430
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,967
<i>Where are you?</i>

431
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,603
That's a phantom called
"The Festival Musical!"

432
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,839
An ancient spirit who punishes
the likes of biker gangs

433
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,574
who interfere with festivals!

434
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,776
I don't really think so.

435
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,953
The God of the festivals
has descended to help us!

436
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,521
Victory is ours!

437
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:02,495
Next, we will use real bullets,
so aim carefully, Saburo.

438
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:03,529
<i>Affirmative.</i>

439
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,364
Please stop this right now!

440
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,768
The Shogun is already
long gone from the festival.

441
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,503
Is that so?

442
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:13,506
Well, my eyes are going bad,
so I couldn't see that.

443
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:14,707
But that's okay.

444
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,609
Then, I'll just go
after that pesky group

445
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,310
called the Shinsengumi.

446
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,512
Hiraga, stop!

447
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:20,746
Hey, hey!

448
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,415
That's quite a dangerous show
you're putting on out here.

449
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,785
Is it some sort
of superhero show?

450
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,288
Well then let me play
the hero for today!

451
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,957
You're not good enough
for the role, Gintoki.

452
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,460
Who are you
to diss the actor...

453
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,529
when you wrote
such a crappy script?

454
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,232
Revenge flicks
are so outdated, anyway!

455
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,635
Besides,
you're disappointing Saburo.

456
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,303
Which Saburo do you mean?

457
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,938
Both of them.

458
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,808
Nobody ever wanted things
to turn out like this.

459
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,710
You know that better
than anyone else, Hiraga.

460
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,245
Yes, I do know that.

461
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,748
But I just cant stand
the pain anymore.

462
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,050
Letting my son die like that,

463
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,352
while this old body
continues to live on.

464
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,723
I'm tired of living my life
just staring at useless things.

465
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,595
I actually don't really give a damn
about the Shogun's head anymore.

466
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,897
I fully realize that
there's nothing I can to do

467
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,266
for someone
who's already dead.

468
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:18,204
All I want at this point is to die,
living by my principles.

469
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,471
So get out of my way.

470
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,674
I'll show you no mercy
if you get in my way.

471
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,711
I'm not moving, because I have my
principles that I live by, too.

472
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,317
Fire!

473
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,730
Saburo!

474
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:45,965
You idiot!

475
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,133
Why didn't you fire
your weapon?

476
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,402
<i>D... dad...</i>

477
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,005
<i>I loved...</i>

478
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,907
<i>watching you...</i>

479
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:57,876
<i>work happily...</i>

480
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,212
<i>like a kid...</i>

481
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,414
<i>playing and having...</i>

482
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,384
<i>fun in the mud...</i>

483
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,990
<i>I loved you like that, dad.</i>

484
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,399
What is it with all of you?

485
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,501
What do you
want me to do?

486
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,204
How do you expect me
to go on?

487
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,640
How do I go on living?

488
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,776
What meaning is there
in my life now?

489
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,412
It totally beats me.

490
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,849
Just go on living
a long life, maybe?

491
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,894
It looks like
you failed in your plan.

492
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,864
We had unexpected interference.

493
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:54,233
I thought he'd lost his fangs
a long time ago,

494
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,201
but, boy, was I wrong
about that!

495
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,537
When it comes to protecting
something important,

496
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,606
everybody bares their fangs.

497
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,208
You, who no longer
has anything to protect

498
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,377
are nothing more
than a beast, Takasugi.

499
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:07,546
I'm fine being a beast now.

500
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,049
I have nothing to protect,
nor do I need one.

501
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,119
I will simply
destroy everything,

502
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,122
until the beast
inside me stops whining.

503
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,792
Hey, you depraved priest!

504
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,528
My name is Katsura,
and I'm not a depraved priest.

505
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,762
What do you think
you're doing?

506
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,364
Look here, you broke it!

507
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,669
This is a wind up toy?

508
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,438
Hey, stop touching that!

509
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,807
‐Why don't you just buy it already?
‐Oh, wow!

510
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,075
‐Just buy the damn thing...
‐Look at that.

511
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:37,476
...and I know you'll love it!

512
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,947
<i>He looks like</i>
<i>he's doing alright now.</i>

513
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,040
<i>The Masked Loincloth Bandit?</i>

514
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,241
<i>Who is that?</i>

515
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,243
<i>He wears a red loincloth on his head</i>

516
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,878
