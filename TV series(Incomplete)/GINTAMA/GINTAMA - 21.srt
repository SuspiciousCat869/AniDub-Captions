1
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,968
I hooked one, this time
it's really a big one.

2
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:42,769
You're not getting away.

3
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,809
What the hell is this?

4
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,310
Ever since the Sky People came

5
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,546
the Earth's ecosystem
has gotten really weird.

6
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,048
Whatever, man,
just put it in the bucket.

7
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,183
What?

8
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,518
‐We're really eating this?
‐Of course we're eating it!

9
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,354
Sea cucumber and
Natto tastes good, right?

10
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,423
The more grotesque it looks,
the better it tastes when you eat it...

11
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,026
Even ugly women always have at
least one or two good points.

12
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,227
Hey, Gin, Gin!

13
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,697
Look here, I really caught a huge one!

14
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:11,932
Look, look!

15
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,203
It doesn't really hurt?

16
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:17,371
No, it does hurt!
No!

17
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,707
Hey, Gin, can we eat
this one too?

18
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,246
No!
Our dinner!

19
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,448
Now forget everything
you just saw, got it?

20
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,685
Gintoki, was that a
swamp monster, a Kappa?

21
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,420
As if such a thing exists!

22
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,523
It was just, you know, a regular old bald
dude who lives in the pond.

23
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,259
"Regular old bald dudes"
don't live in ponds, Gin.

24
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,727
And besides, he was kinda green.

25
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,295
That's because...

26
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,463
Oh, you know...

27
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,731
He's got some drinking problems.

28
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,900
Everyone would stop
drinking if it made them

29
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,602
look like a low budget grinch!

30
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:52,339
You bastards!
My glasses are broken, damn it!

31
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,041
Call your parents!

32
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,143
You guys are gonna
buy me a new pair!

33
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,445
It's alive!

34
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:59,813
Hey!

35
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,481
Come back here, you guys!

36
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,183
You're not getting away!

37
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,419
I want your names
and addresses!

38
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,163
If you had apologized
at the start,

39
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,532
I wouldn't be so angry
with you about this.

40
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,002
If you do something wrong, the
right thing to do is to apologize.

41
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,437
Why did you run?

42
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,006
Um, well, because you're a kappa.

43
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,207
A kappa?

44
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,041
What is that?

45
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,744
Don't try to trick me by talking
such nonsense!

46
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,913
You're the one that's
making no sense, dude!

47
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:36,049
What is it about me that doesn't
make any sense, girl?

48
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,585
And my name isn't dude,
its Mr. Ebina.

49
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,454
We're sorry, Mr.Ebina.

50
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,557
Uh, I'll break my glasses, too,
so please forgive us.

51
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,594
That was a very fine apology, son.

52
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,996
Why don't you take this biscuit
as a reward?

53
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,532
Thanks but no thanks,
I'll pass on that.

54
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,569
Well, it's a good thing it was
only my glasses that broke.

55
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,172
If it was the dish on my head that broke,
this old man would have lost it.

56
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,741
I'd have beaten you all to a pulp, huh?

57
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:04,811
Listen up.

58
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,446
This dish is like a vital organ.

59
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,281
My life actually depends on this thing.

60
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,818
‐No!
‐The dish on his head broke!

61
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:12,886
Oh man!

62
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:13,753
The dish on his head broke!

63
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,555
Though I don't know whats
so bad about that!

64
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,924
Oh, I'm sorry!

65
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,894
I was practicing my golf swing
and the club...

66
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,030
it just slipped out of my hands!

67
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,833
This is why I told you you
should leave this place.

68
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,001
This isn't your home.

69
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:28,969
This is my property.

70
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,037
I bought out this entire area.

71
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,507
You should shut up!
I've been living here since before you

72
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,175
even came out of your
father's ball sack!

73
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,410
Why should I be the
one to leave here?

74
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,747
And stop staring at me!
It's embarrassing!

75
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,349
No cameras please.

76
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,350
Seriously...

77
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,418
He just got a bit shy
after his dish cracked.

78
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,287
I thought his life depended
on that thing.

79
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,657
I am planning to build a huge
golf course on this land,

80
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,026
and this pond just happens
to be in the way!

81
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,929
I'll find you another pond
for you to settle into,

82
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,964
so would you please
just leave nicely?

83
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,033
That's not the issue here at all!

84
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,605
This pond doesn't belong only to me.

85
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,874
It also belongs to...

86
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,342
I don't really understand
what you're saying,

87
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,311
but if you're going to
cause me any more trouble,

88
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,380
you'd better be prepared
for what's coming.

89
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,184
You'd better keep an eye out for any
stray golf balls coming your way!

90
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,307
There, now it's fixed, old man.

91
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,743
Did I just hear a
cracking noise rigth now?

92
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,212
It's just your imagination.

93
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,548
Say old man, if you're going
to move, we can help you.

94
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,584
It's none of your business, moptop!

95
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,322
Look over there.

96
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,291
See that odd‐looking island?

97
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,728
That's the spaceship I rode
here on a long time ago.

98
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,830
Mr. Ebina, you're an Amanto, then?

99
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,968
My species cannot survive
without any clean water.

100
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,203
A long time ago,

101
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,441
<i>our planet lost all its water in a</i>
<i>catastrophic natural disaster.</i>

102
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,109
<i>So we set out to find</i>
<i>a brand new home.</i>

103
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,713
<i>I found my way to this planet</i>
<i>full of water.</i>

104
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,548
<i>Planet Earth...</i>

105
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,486
<i>I was amazed to find out such</i>
<i>a lovely planet could exist.</i>

106
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,623
<i>At the time, there were</i>
<i>hardly any Amanto,</i>

107
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,726
<i>so I felt as though I had</i>
<i>this jewel all to myself.</i>

108
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,563
<i>But the people of the Earth</i>
<i>only saw me</i>

109
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,265
<i>as nothing more than a monster.</i>

110
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,770
<i>I was persecuted and forced to return</i>
<i>to this pond to live in solitude.</i>

111
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,808
But you know,

112
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,078
you can only truly feel alive when
you have other people around

113
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,713
you to connect with.

114
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,884
Sure I found a safe place to live,
but I may as well have been dead.

115
00:06:58,652 --> 00:06:59,953
Until...

116
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,454
<i>I met her, that is.</i>

117
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,926
<i>She appeared one day</i>
<i>along the pond bank.</i>

118
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,395
<i>She didn't do anything,</i>

119
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,730
<i>she</i> <i>would</i> <i>just</i> <i>always</i>
<i>stare</i> <i>out</i> <i>at</i> <i>the</i> <i>water.</i>

120
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,533
<i>At first, I hid from her, but...</i>

121
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,535
<i>after a while it just seemed silly...</i>

122
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,739
You there, why do you
always just sit there?

123
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,443
<i>The girl looked at me,</i>
<i>and was a bit surprised, but...</i>

124
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,613
It's boring being all alone
in my bedroom,

125
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,949
so I thought "why not be
alone out here?"

126
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,118
But I guess there
were two of us.

127
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,622
<i>The girl had</i>
<i>tuberculosis,</i>

128
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,824
<i>very contagious.</i>

129
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,561
<i>She had been sneaking out of her</i>
<i>room where she was kept isolated</i>

130
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,630
<i>because</i> <i>no</i> <i>one</i> <i>wanted</i>
<i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>around</i> <i>her.</i>

131
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,632
She didn't care who I was,

132
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,133
she just wanted
someone to talk to.

133
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,336
That was exactly what I wanted.

134
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,240
<i>Ever since then, the only</i>
<i>time I really felt alive...</i>

135
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,875
<i>was when I was talking with her.</i>

136
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,979
<i>We only ever talked about silly things,</i>
<i>but it was fun.</i>

137
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,986
You're very lucky, mister.

138
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,521
How so?

139
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,991
You can swim freely in such
lovely water as this.

140
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,462
I've been very frail since
I was a tiny child...

141
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,864
so I've never been
able to swim at all.

142
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,167
I wish I could swim
like you, just once.

143
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,637
In that translucent world.

144
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,376
Just strengthen your body then.

145
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,877
That's impossible.

146
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,345
I've been like this all my life.

147
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,380
Oh,silly girl!

148
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,914
Life is very long.

149
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,651
I'll protect this place until you're
strong and healthy.

150
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,453
I'll keep it

151
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,822
just as beautiful as it is now.

152
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,858
So, all you need to do
is hurry and get well.

153
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,560
All right, then.

154
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,963
It's a promise, mister Pinky swear.

155
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,331
You bet!

156
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,646
A pinky swear promise?

157
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,214
How many decades ago was that?

158
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:09,883
Who knows?

159
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,484
But then...

160
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,220
the ship he came on looks like
it's been there a long time.

161
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,523
So its likely that that girl is already...

162
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,025
This guy is way too die hard.

163
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,261
I can't go along with this.

164
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,103
Okay!
Everything good?

165
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,671
Right, get to it.

166
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,872
Right.

167
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,676
I've just about had it with
that rotten kappa out there,

168
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,879
so I'm going to fill this
entire lake with dirt.

169
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,714
But are you sure it's okay?

170
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,116
What about the kappa's curse?

171
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,017
You idiot!

172
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,718
There's no such thing
as a real kappa!

173
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,787
That's just an Amanto
in the water.

174
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,490
Damn it man.

175
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,659
Why do we have to do this
in the middle of the night?

176
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,495
What's going on?
It stopped!

177
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,533
Hi, I am Kappa number three.

178
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,734
Got a cucumber, mister?

179
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,673
What's going on with Nojima?

180
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,007
Hey, what's going on?

181
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,643
Did you get your balls caught
in the bulldozer or something?

182
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,215
It is me, Kappa Number Two!

183
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,820
What's with all that screaming
over there?

184
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,123
Did you get your balls caught
in the bulldozer or something?

185
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,357
Onishi!

186
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,659
Go take a look at, huh?

187
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,761
Onishi?

188
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,169
Who are you?

189
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,471
We are the tree Kappa brothers
from Lake Toya.

190
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,307
I am the eldest of the three kappa
brothers, Kappa Number One.

191
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,277
I would leave this property
alone if I were you,

192
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,446
or you'll feel the wrath
of the kappa's curse!

193
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,214
No, no, please.

194
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,682
Please!
What do kappas want?

195
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:50,750
Cucumbers, right?

196
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:51,918
Tell me what you want!

197
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,554
I don't have much hair,
but I have plenty of money, of course!

198
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,156
What we like?

199
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,524
Let's see...

200
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,361
We like sweets, I guess.

201
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,796
And guys who are a bit too die hard.

202
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,279
Hey, there.

203
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,346
You're here again?

204
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,415
Hey, I heard the news.

205
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,317
Seems this land was
put up for sale...

206
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,686
Sounds like you'll be okay
for a little while.

207
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,856
Yeah, apparently some real
kappa appeared here.

208
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,591
Now that would be pretty scary.

209
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,460
Could it have been you?

210
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,731
Hey!

211
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,935
I didn't know there were such
beautiful fish living in this pond.

212
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,138
It sure seems to be having
a good time!

213
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,949
Four hundred and sixty two.

214
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,750
What's that number?

215
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,253
The number of people who
have collapsed this summer

216
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,221
from heatstroke so far.

217
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,423
Are you serious?

218
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,726
Gin, can we just buy an
air conditioner already?

219
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,296
This year's heat wave is too much
to get by with just a simple fan.

220
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,264
Don't be ridiculous.

221
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,566
Where are we going to
find the money for that?

222
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,769
Forget about conditioning our air
learn to condition your mind.

223
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,038
Suppress your mind to a state of
nothingness and even...

224
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,341
the South Pole can be as
cold as the North Pole.

225
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,577
Gin, just so you know they
call it the "south" pole,

226
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,879
but that doesn't mean
it's always summer there.

227
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,148
I already knew that.

228
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,818
I know the South Pole isn't
an endless summer paradise,

229
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,519
but what I'm trying to say...

230
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,622
is that if you suppress your mind
to a state of nothingness...

231
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,624
Actually, it doesn't do anything.

232
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:38,925
Shame on you!

233
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,860
I think your brain's turned
into burnt toast.

234
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,228
This is totally ridiculous.

235
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,963
What was the point of
this conversation?

236
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,399
First of all, try going out
on a day like this.

237
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,701
You'll collapse before you can
buy an air conditioner.

238
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,503
The best thing to do
on a day like this is

239
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,472
to lay around the house
and do nothing.

240
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,475
So it would seem that the
fan is our only lifeline.

241
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,044
I think we should all be
careful not to break it.

242
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,397
I just can't stand it!

243
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,199
What's hot is hot even if
I suppress my mind.

244
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,636
Why do I have to go outside and
buy a fan on a day like this?

245
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,204
What a pain in the ass!

246
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,207
Maybe I'll just buy an air
conditioner instead.

247
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,942
What do you say, old man?

248
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,278
Should I upgrade to
an air conditioner?

249
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,914
Well, I don't see why not.

250
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,015
You don't see why not?

251
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,384
Where am I going to find the money
to buy an air conditioner?

252
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,619
Mind your own business!

253
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,256
Why do I have to get drenched in
sweat to go and buy a machine

254
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,557
that makes me cooler?

255
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,927
It's like digging for buried
gold with buried gold.

256
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,729
Like drinking before drinking.

257
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,932
When the next fan arrives,
I'm going to bully him.

258
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,467
For three days and three nights,

259
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,369
I'm going to let it
blow out the window.

260
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,304
Man this really ticks me off.

261
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,872
Maybe I'll just buy an air conditioner!

262
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:00,807
But I don't have any money.

263
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,009
An electric fan?

264
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,611
I'm sorry, sir, but we don't
have anything like that here.

265
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:08,815
These days, everyone uses air
conditioners, you know?

266
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:09,816
How about it, mister?

267
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,018
Why not use this opportunity
to make an upgrade?

268
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,786
‐I'll make it cheap.
‐You mean that?

269
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,088
Okay, then, sir.

270
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,591
What do you say, then,
to 10 bucks?

271
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,560
Step right up!
Come one, come all!

272
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,490
‐Mister? That's very strange.
‐You don't make any eye contact with me anymore.

273
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,702
An electric fan?

274
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,703
No, no, no.

275
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,939
Maybe you should try
an antique shop.

276
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,209
A fan?

277
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,910
You're using a fan
in this day and age?

278
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,278
Isn't that like so crazy?

279
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,379
That's like so retro!

280
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,748
That's like so crazy retro!

281
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,084
A fa...?

282
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,153
What're you doing?

283
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,055
I haven't said anything yet!
Put me down! Put me down!

284
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:49,956
‐Put me down.
‐Shut up!

285
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,657
You probably don't
have one anyway.

286
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:52,892
I already know that.

287
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,660
‐I already did some research
‐Put me down! Put me down!

288
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,862
at the back alley shops, and nothing!

289
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,132
Grrr, this is really pissing me off!

290
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,900
Even that beautiful
blue sky ticks me off!

291
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,868
And it's so blue!

292
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,071
Why am I soaking with sweat and
passing around from store to store

293
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,639
just to buy a measly fan?

294
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,975
Hey, there, mister,
can I go home now?

295
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,276
Can I just go home already?

296
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,613
Well, I don't see why you couldn't.

297
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,814
You don't see why I couldn't?

298
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,482
I've already been through
hell itself for this!

299
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:17,583
You don't know a thing at all!

300
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,851
Don't act like you do!

301
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,888
Damn it.
This is wrong, this is so wrong.

302
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:22,989
I'm here to buy a fan.

303
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,724
I came all this way to cool down!

304
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,359
But I'm just getting more
and more heated!

305
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,427
This seriously ticking me off!

306
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,962
I should've just gotten
an air conditioner!

307
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,697
But I don't have any money.

308
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:47,013
My, my. It's unusual to have a
samurai for a customer here.

309
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,281
Welcome.

310
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,482
An electric fan...

311
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,517
You have an electric fan, don't you?

312
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,518
Go get me one!

313
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:57,723
A fan.

314
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,226
How nostalgic, isn't it?

315
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,296
Tell me, where did you hear
about such a rare thing?

316
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,965
It doesn't matter, just go get one!

317
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,667
Now hold on just a moment.

318
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,469
You're the first person
who's come this far for one.

319
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,004
At least tell me your name.

320
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,806
What do you need
my name for, lady?

321
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,341
I'm just a customer.

322
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:16,976
Customer?

323
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,345
That's a very fine name then.

324
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,781
I'll be seeing you, then, Customer!

325
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,082
Whoa!

326
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,517
What'd you do
that for, you freak!

327
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:25,418
Manager!

328
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:26,953
Where's the manager?

329
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:27,987
Let go of me!

330
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,490
I'll never let an evil syndicate like
yours have the fan, I swear it!

331
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,559
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

332
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,727
Calm down.

333
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,796
Are you're mistaking me for
someone else, is that it?

334
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,097
I just came to buy a fan.

335
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,768
Hey!
What's the matter?

336
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:43,970
Blood?

337
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,770
What?
Manager!

338
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,038
Where's the manager?

339
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,841
I have found it at last.

340
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,810
The sewer rat's nest.

341
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,881
We didn't think anyone other
than that woman survived.

342
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,018
But it seems that your luck
has just run out.

343
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,153
Earth Defense Army.

344
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:03,856
What?

345
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,024
Are you talking to me?

346
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:05,858
Earth Defen...

347
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:06,993
Say what?

348
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,561
Don't play dumb, you scumbag!

349
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,130
I know that you're a remnant
of the Earth Defense Army!

350
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,198
Earth Defense Army?

351
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,767
I did once build a bookshelf
from milk cartons

352
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,370
‐to protect the environment, but an army.
‐Don't give me that!

353
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,305
Hand over the fan right now!

354
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,941
Oh, so then you're here to
buy an electric fan, too?

355
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,677
Is there a retro fad going
on or something?

356
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,179
I didn't know they were
that popular these days.

357
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,681
No wonder I can't buy one.

358
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,816
I'm not letting...

359
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,019
anyone have the fan.

360
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,555
You'll never get is
as long as I live!

361
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,392
This is... a grena...

362
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:06,852
Why does this

363
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,554
always have to
happen to me?

364
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,623
All I wanted was to buy a fan.

365
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,294
I don't even know who you are,

366
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,396
but you don't seem
to be a bad person.

367
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,966
I already told you,
I just came here to buy a fan.

368
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,802
But I'd rather give it to you than

369
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,570
hand it over to those guys.

370
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,872
Will you take care of this for me?

371
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,140
Hey, are you listening?

372
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,242
I said I only came here to buy a fan.

373
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,478
The fan is sealed at that location.

374
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,480
I want you to go there,

375
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,582
and destroy the
fan for me.

376
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,385
You're telling someone who came
to buy a fan to go destroy it?

377
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:42,455
It's an evil machine that
destroys human souls.

378
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,724
It's not something people
should be allowed to have.

379
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,158
What do you mean?

380
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,094
Are you talking about
how you get your hands

381
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,829
caught if you stick it in?
That does hurt.

382
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,597
Everyone does that
at least once.

383
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,635
<i>My father was one of the top</i>
<i>mechanical engineers in Edo City.</i>

384
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,838
<i>People sought his skills and</i>
<i>made my father build that thing.</i>

385
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,775
But it was the last machine
that my father ever built.

386
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,711
I managed to retrieve
the fan from those men,

387
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,513
but I haven't had the heart to
destroy it.

388
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,182
This is all because I was too weak.

389
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,652
But if that falls into their
hands, it's all over.

390
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,021
Please just take the fan and...

391
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,356
Hurry up and go!

392
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,457
But I just...

393
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,593
Save this city,

394
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,162
I'm begging you to
save the Earth!

395
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:27,900
I keep telling you, I just came
here to buy a simple fan!

396
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,304
Something's wrong.

397
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,606
Something's very wrong!

398
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,141
I came to buy a simple fan!

399
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,176
Tell me, why is this
happening to me?

400
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,246
‐Stop rigth there!
‐Hey, old man!

401
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,814
Why is this happening to me?!

402
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,783
What's going on?
Just Tell me!

403
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,284
I'm sorry, I don't know.

404
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,019
I don't know, either, Moron!

405
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,189
Go to hell!

406
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,725
I have come way too
far to turn back now!

407
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,460
The fan...

408
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,996
is mine!

409
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:03,235
What?

410
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,204
Who the hell is that guy?

411
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,307
Was there such a monster
in the Earth Defense Army?

412
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,341
After him!

413
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,342
Don't let him get away!

414
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,645
We must retrieve
the fan at any cost!

415
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,485
What is this place?

416
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,287
There's nothing but junk in here.

417
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,122
Where's the fan.

418
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,191
Where's the fan, is it in here?

419
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,526
What is this?

420
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,096
This huge storefront cat
seriously gives me the creeps.

421
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,467
Up we go.

422
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:35,634
And.

423
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:36,836
back, back, back down!

424
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,207
Are these...

425
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,375
gold coins?

426
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,444
Surprised, are you?

427
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:49,248
That's the robotic gold‐coin
counterfeiting machine no.3

428
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,017
built by the brilliant mechanical
engineering prodigy.

429
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,254
In other words,
thid s a fake money maker,

430
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,388
which is all ready to use,

431
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,657
and is now in full throttle
kind of machine.

432
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,260
We call it the FAN, for short!

433
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,531
Thank you for showing us
the way to get in here.

434
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,435
Now hand over the FAN!

435
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,338
You'll do it if you value her life!

436
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:13,739
Don't worry about me at all!

437
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,608
Just destroy it like I told you!

438
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,877
Where's the spinning part?

439
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,613
‐What?
‐I mean, not this.

440
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,582
but the part that whirls
around and blows air.

441
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,885
I'm asking you where that is!

442
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,486
No!

443
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,390
What have you done?

444
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:32,892
The FAN!

445
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,927
Do you have any idea
what that's worth,

446
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,162
and you destroyed it?

447
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,597
Giving it such a confusing name!

448
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:41,066
I'll phone the consumer advocates
on you bastards.

449
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,402
I'm soaking with sweat.

450
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,803
I've had to work so hard.

451
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,772
and even trashed my mo‐ped.

452
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,642
Curse you, you Damned
Earth Defense Army!

453
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,210
You won't get away with this!

454
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,678
Now that it's come to this,

455
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,381
I'll use my greatest secret weapon
to put an end to you.

456
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:57,783
This stupid thing.

457
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,219
I should've just bought
an air conditioner.

458
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,588
Air conditioners are the
way of the future.

459
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,691
Oh yeah, I don't have any money.

460
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,594
Now die!

461
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,229
What?

462
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,263
You...

463
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,699
stupid bastard!

464
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,484
Wait a second!

465
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,153
Thank you so much.

466
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,822
You're the hero
who saved Edo City.

467
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:40,459
Please let me repay you.

468
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:44,263
I don't have much, but I do
have an air conditioner at home.

469
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,165
I don't want an air conditioner.

470
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:50,002
I already told you like I said
from the beginning, I...

471
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,404
So now you understand it.

472
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:56,008
Took blood, sweat and more sweat
to get this fan here.

473
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:57,009
And look.

474
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,545
Just look at its brilliant luster
that this thing has.

475
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,647
Doesn't that look a little bit filthy?

476
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,516
That's because your eyes are
a little bit filthy, Shinpachi.

477
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,320
Now this time, use it carefully
so you don't break it.

478
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,422
Hold on, you were the
one who broke it.

479
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,091
What's this?

480
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,626
That's odd.

481
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:14,727
It won't turn on.

482
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,528
You cheapskate!

483
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:17,997
I'll bet you picked
that up from the dump,

484
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,798
and made up that whole
story to cover it.

485
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,433
What the hell is the
Earth Defense Army?

486
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,002
Your story was way too long!

487
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,003
You big liar!

488
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,571
You big, fat liar!

489
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,207
What did you use the money
you took with for?

490
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,675
‐Gambling?!
‐Wait a minute!

491
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,010
It really is the truth!

492
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:32,978
I destroyed an evil organization!

493
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,215
Listen, I really did save
the world, it's the truth!

494
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,879
Stop going to the
Cabaret club so often!
