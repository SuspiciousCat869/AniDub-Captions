1
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:03,770
Remember to keep
the lights on,

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,405
and don't sit too close
to the screen.

3
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,873
Hey, just a minute there.

4
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,875
You on the bicycle,
stop for a second.

5
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,979
Your lantern should be
lit at night.

6
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,247
It's against the law
to ride without it...

7
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,416
Let's see...

8
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,386
Now tell me, sir,
is this bicycle registered?

9
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,655
Uh, I'm not sure, officer.

10
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,423
I borrowed this from a friend.

11
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,358
I see.

12
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:05,726
Doing a little shopping, then?

13
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,362
You get yourself some porno
magazines or something?

14
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,163
Uh, can I go now, officers?

15
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,231
I have stuff to do.

16
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,468
We've had lot of panty thieves
around here recently.

17
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,803
Have you heard of the
Masked Loincloth?

18
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,839
He broke out of prison again.

19
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,607
Well, I prefer boxers.

20
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:21,708
Good bye.

21
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,710
Hey, Hang on a second, buddy,

22
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,679
I need to see your
identification!

23
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,514
Hey!
Hey, buddy!

24
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,818
Hey, Captain Okita.

25
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:32,986
That long hair must be...!

26
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,221
Found you at last!..

27
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,756
Katsura!

28
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,898
Farewell to you, Katsura.

29
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:49,836
Damn!

30
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:54,508
Farewell to you.

31
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,812
Damn!

32
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:00,480
Get him!

33
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,349
It's Katsura of the
exclusionist rebels.

34
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,184
He's somewhere nearby!

35
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,285
Keep looking!

36
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,887
We have to find him
no matter what!

37
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,526
I'm not letting you get away, Katsura.

38
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,529
That is...

39
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,900
Katsura, come out already!

40
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,535
We're not letting you get away.

41
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,335
Give it up!

42
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,804
We know that he's injured.

43
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,305
He couldn't have gone too far!

44
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:30,644
Damn it.

45
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:31,678
It doesn't look like he's here.

46
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,213
‐Keep moving!
‐Sir!

47
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,691
<i>He's got to be around here!</i>

48
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,692
<i>Find him!</i>

49
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,594
This isn't looking good...

50
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,529
They have me surrounded...

51
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,667
Looks like the end of
the line for me...

52
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,048
Good evening, madam.
I am Santa Claus.

53
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,354
Good grief...

54
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,822
Talk about misleading, huh?

55
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,091
It's your own fault
for sneaking around

56
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,993
when there's a panty thief
on the loose...

57
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,028
Have a bowl of ramen
and we'll call it even.

58
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,997
I run a ramen shop, so...

59
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,933
it's the best I can do for you
to make up for everything.

60
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,307
Ah.
My name is Ikumatsu.

61
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,375
I'm the owner here.

62
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,743
I am Katsura.

63
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,378
My favorite food
is soba noodles...

64
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,579
Why are you telling me that!

65
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,214
Would you prefer soba
noodles instead?

66
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,582
Is my ramen not good enough?

67
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,919
Anyway, why don't you tell me,

68
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,687
what were you
doing up on the roof?

69
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,422
Hm, oh you know how it goes...

70
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,558
I took a wrong turn somewhere.

71
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,762
Ohhh, so you got lost and somehow
ended up on the roof?

72
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,298
Were you trying to find
your way to heaven?

73
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,600
No, no, no, that's not it at all.

74
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,369
I made a wrong turn in life.

75
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,538
So then you are a panty thief,
aren't you?!

76
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,641
Everyone has a skeleton
or two in their closet.

77
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,110
But let me say this to you.

78
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,879
There's nothing suspicious
about me at all.

79
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:13,980
Go look in the mirror.

80
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,149
You'll see a suspicious guy
with long hair.

81
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,426
Are you...

82
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,961
No way.
I'm just, you know,

83
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,129
just checking the weather.

84
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,297
Honest to God...

85
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,269
Shoot, what awful weather.

86
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,973
Ikumatsu, may I stay here for a little
while until it stops raining?

87
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:41,808
Rain?

88
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,310
Since when has it been raining?

89
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,548
Alright, I'm going be completely
honest with you...

90
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,218
I pursue the Way of Ramen,

91
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,620
traveling to study the Ramen
from every region...

92
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,388
Your ramen is exquisite.

93
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,057
Please teach me how to make it.

94
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,026
Didn't you just tell me that
you preferred soba noodles?

95
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,329
Ramen and soba noodles are
basically the same thing.

96
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,597
They're both long and skinny.

97
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,765
You don't have the right
to talk about ramen!

98
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,270
Besides, there's nothing
you can learn from here...

99
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,572
Unfortunately, I don't get
many customers,

100
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,441
and the few that I do
get here are...

101
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,545
Ikumatsu!

102
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,714
Lookin' good!

103
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,284
Don't be so cold, baby!

104
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,754
Your dear little brother just dropped
by to see what's up.

105
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,822
What a joke!

106
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,156
You're not my brother, you know!

107
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,291
Now that Daigo is dead,

108
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,227
you and I are not related
to each other whatsoever.

109
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,863
Don't be like that, come on!

110
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,366
I've been taking the time
to come all the way here

111
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:42,469
just to see how my big bro's
widow is doing...

112
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,538
This used to be my
brother's shop, you know.

113
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,008
When he died, I was supposed
to get the shop,

114
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,378
but you said you wanted
it so badly, so I let you keep it,

115
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:55,115
but I think I should get a little
paycheck for my generosity, huh?

116
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,216
You want money again?!

117
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,417
I don't have a dime to...!

118
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,452
Greetings to you, gentlemen.

119
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,388
May I please take your order?

120
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,423
Hey!
Who are you trying to be?

121
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,724
Is this a French Restaurant?

122
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:05,492
Hey, hey!

123
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,427
Where'd you get the money
for a waiter?

124
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,663
My name is Katsura,
and I'm not a waiter.

125
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,298
What would you like to eat?

126
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,999
Did I hear three plates of fried rice?

127
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,302
Who said anything about
plates of fried rice?

128
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,405
We didn't come here to eat, so why
don't you just leave us alone?

129
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,572
Beat it!
Beat it!

130
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,242
Then may I recommend
our Full Course Meal?

131
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,443
Was that course "B"?

132
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,012
I don't care if it's a full course
meal or a full horse meal,

133
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,047
just shut the hell up!

134
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,783
I've got something very important to
discuss with Ikumatsu!

135
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,219
All right then, Ikumatsu,
three fried rice plates, please.

136
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,654
‐What's with the fried rice?!
‐What's with the fried rice?!

137
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,658
Today's appetizer is fried rice

138
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,494
and our Full Course Meal also comes
with a main dish and dessert.

139
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,395
‐Today's appetizer?
‐Today's appetizer?

140
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,230
‐That's a huge plate of fried rice!
‐That's a huge plate of fried rice!

141
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,099
Just shut up!
Ignore him.

142
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,302
Ikumatsu, hurry up and
hand over the money, baby.

143
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,837
I really need it.

144
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:54,808
The last time I gave you
any money,

145
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,276
I told you that was the end of it.

146
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,411
Besides, I heard that
you guys claimed to be...

147
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,581
exclusionist rebels to gain
the trust of people

148
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,650
and then broke into a
grocery store's safe.

149
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,286
You wouldn't understand!

150
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,687
It's a small sacrifice to make

151
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,556
for the big task
of saving our country!

152
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,459
Now we have a huge responsibility
and need money for the cause!

153
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,763
You three are no rebels,

154
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,098
you're just a bunch of broke thugs

155
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,899
that just want to take my hard
earned money!

156
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,701
Even the Shinsengumi
roaming outside

157
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,604
wouldn't even bother with little
insignificant brats like you!

158
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,128
This is why I hate people like you!

159
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,596
If it wasn't for people like you.

160
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,732
If it wasn't for people like you,
Daigo might still be alive!

161
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,833
What did you say to me?

162
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,502
Your main dish is now served, sir.

163
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,137
Shut up!
Beat it!

164
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:58,772
Fried rice again?

165
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,307
‐The main dish is fried rice?
‐It's shrimp fried rice.

166
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:04,244
And for dessert, we have a
nice bowl of ice cold fried rice.

167
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,179
What? Don't you have anything
other than fried rice!

168
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,981
What is this obsession
you have with fried rice?

169
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,616
Are you some kind of
fried rice maniac?

170
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:13,620
What the?

171
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,921
My stomach!

172
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,222
I don't feel so good...

173
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,824
‐Mine, too.
‐I feel...

174
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,627
a murderous intent from
my stomach I gotta go.

175
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:21,694
The john....

176
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,996
Is occupied.

177
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,531
You bastard!!

178
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,502
My stomach...

179
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,470
I can't hold it...

180
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,505
You put something in the
fried rice, didn't you?

181
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,406
Dammit!

182
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,407
We'll remember this!

183
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,442
Oh no!

184
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,810
It's coming.

185
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,623
What kind of a freak is that?

186
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,365
You did a really
good job with them.

187
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,967
What are you talking about?

188
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,803
All I did was provide a service,
just as all waiters do.

189
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:08,108
So then, weren't you seeking
the Way of Ramen?

190
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,712
Well, I did...

191
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,348
Let's just say I'm a waiter
seeking the Way of Ramen,

192
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,282
and leave it at that.

193
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,650
You're an odd fellow.

194
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,153
Sticking your nose into
other people's troubles.

195
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,560
Well, never mind.

196
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,130
Whether it's until
the rain stops,

197
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,600
or until you master
the Way of Ramen,

198
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,435
or until your leg heals...

199
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,005
I will let you stay here,
and learn from me...

200
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,175
Ikumatsu.

201
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,510
But listen, up...

202
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,178
I'm making you work your ass off.

203
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,721
What are you waiting for?

204
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,824
Weren't you going to watch and
learn to master my recipe?

205
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,360
It's just, I think there are
many things in this world

206
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,395
that people are better
off not seeing...

207
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,163
Like behind the scenes of
a Host Club,

208
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,065
or a boyfriend's
smart phone messages.

209
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,869
What is it you're trying to say?

210
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,071
N‐No, never mind.

211
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,008
All right, listen.

212
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,343
Speed determines
the taste of ramen.

213
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,114
Here.

214
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,456
Say, you're pretty good at this.

215
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:40,867
Hey, could you...

216
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,435
take care of a delivery for me?

217
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,007
Oh, my stomach hurts!

218
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,642
And it's raining really hard.

219
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,944
It's not raining!

220
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,011
What are you?

221
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,781
A little kid who doesn't
want to go to the dentist?

222
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,518
<i>Oh boy...</i>

223
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,220
<i>She trusts me far too much.</i>

224
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,027
So you haven't found him yet?

225
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,795
Don't worry, Hijikata.

226
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,831
We have everything
under control.

227
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,066
The Katsura dragnet
is closing in on him.

228
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,536
It's only a matter of time before
he has to give himself away.

229
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,238
I hope you're right, Okita.

230
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,574
Katsura injured his leg
pretty badly.

231
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,242
He isn't getting away.

232
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,379
What?
What is it?

233
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,181
Nothing, I just thought it
was unusual...

234
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,718
This is the first time I've ever seen
you take your work so seriously.

235
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,587
Like I said, it's just unusual.

236
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,956
You're the one
that's unusual, Hijikata.

237
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:10,923
What?

238
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,326
No other creature
on the entire earth...

239
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,061
eats sweet dumplings
with mayo.

240
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,496
Really?

241
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:20,633
You wanna try some?
It's delicious.

242
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,802
Absolutely not,
no thank you.

243
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,038
Remember, we're up
against Katsura.

244
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,506
Don't let your guard down.

245
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,474
You don't need to
remind me of that.

246
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,648
Excuse me, sir...

247
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,383
What is that right there?

248
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,055
What... What the hell...!

249
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,794
Remember, don't let your
guard down, Vice‐chief.

250
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,202
That damn long‐haired freak,
making a fool of us, like that.

251
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,104
I'm not letting him
get away with this.

252
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,482
Yeah, but, bro, he really seemed
strong to me, really, really strong.

253
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,852
Yeah, I don't know if we would be able
to win even if we ganged up on him.

254
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,920
Relax, you two.

255
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,589
Who ever said we're gonna be
taking that kind of risk...

256
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,258
Because I have an idea.

257
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,910
Mommy, I want him!

258
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,146
Don't look into its eyes.

259
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,547
You'll be possessed!

260
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,452
<i>Wow, this looks amazing!</i>

261
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:47,754
<i>How thoughtful of you.</i>

262
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:48,921
It's nothing...

263
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,023
everyone can use a treat
from time to time,

264
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,693
so it's just a little something
for all your hard work...

265
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,027
Good work today.

266
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,598
‐Oh! Is this...?
‐Can you tell?

267
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,600
I splurged a bit and
got a good bottle...

268
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,769
It's delicious.

269
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,537
YohÃ©i brews great sake.

270
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,938
It tastes delicious.

271
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,406
Speaking of taste...

272
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,675
I've been thinking
about this for a while.

273
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,277
Your ramen, Ikumatsu...

274
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,112
There's something missing
isn't there?

275
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,280
What?

276
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,384
I already know it...

277
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,419
I know that there's
something missing.

278
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,256
Then you'll have to add
whatever is missing.

279
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,424
The problem is that
it's not that simple...

280
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,162
to make up for what's
missing, that is.

281
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,867
It's a heavy task.

282
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,878
If you already know what's missing,
then I have nothing more to say...

283
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,880
But be careful,
because you know...

284
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,016
Ignorance is bliss.

285
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,484
Wrong phrase
for the situation!

286
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,452
That's definitely not
the right saying...

287
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,189
and besides, didn't you just say that
you have nothing more to say.

288
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,824
It's like water off a duck's back.

289
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,125
What's that supposed to mean?

290
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,693
Are you calling me a duck?
What's that mean?

291
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,696
‐And Rome wasn't built in a day.
‐Oh really, so was it built in a nigth?

292
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,031
Every time you say something,

293
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,666
you're getting further
from the point.

294
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,238
Listen, all that I'm trying
to say is just that...

295
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,506
Yes, I know...

296
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,275
I can't leave things the way
they are, right?

297
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:28,621
Ikumatsu...

298
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,122
My husband Daigo...

299
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,692
He was murdered by the
Exclusionist Rebels...

300
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:35,628
We made a vow...

301
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,965
that we would become the
top ramen shop in Edo City...

302
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,601
but he got involved in a
terrorist attack...

303
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,336
and that was it...

304
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,874
"Saving the country" by hurting
innocent people is total bullshit...

305
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,010
Spinning their noble‐sounding words,

306
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,945
and then destroying
whatever they want...

307
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,180
How many of them,

308
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,016
I wonder, truly care about
saving their country at all?

309
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,720
If they can't even save the people
right in front of them,

310
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,822
there's no way they can
save this country...

311
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,590
Patriots my ass...

312
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,392
Samurai my ass...

313
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:10,796
<i>I hate them all.</i>

314
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,604
Listen, I already told you I can't
hire someone like you.

315
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,242
Look...

316
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,245
there's nobody who would want
anything to do with you at all...

317
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,581
Ikumatsu, two pork
broth ramen, please.

318
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:29,782
Coming right up!

319
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,118
Tell us, tell us, Ikumatsu...

320
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,185
Tell what?

321
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,487
Who's the handsome
new waiter?

322
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,755
And are you two together?

323
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,658
<i>You never let any men get near</i>
<i>you since your husband died.</i>

324
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,393
But you did really well
with this one.

325
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,262
<i>It's not like that at all!</i>
<i>He's just helping me out!</i>

326
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,231
<i>And what's so handsome</i>
<i>about him, anyway?</i>

327
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,199
I mean, look at his long hair!

328
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,935
Men always look best in crew cuts.

329
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:52,471
That's what you say, but I bet you
have the hots for him anyway.

330
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,839
No way.

331
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,042
‐Really?
‐Really.

332
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,183
Ikumatsu, we need to talk
for a minute...

333
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,723
Ikumatsu is not here?
Where did she go?

334
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,575
Hey, listen, bro, you really sure you
want to sell off your sister‐in‐law?

335
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,645
Yo, my brother died a
very long time ago.

336
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,547
We ain't even related anymore.

337
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:41,320
She definitely trusts me
far too much.

338
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:47,593
I thought she would be a good cash
dispenser so I left her alone...

339
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,195
but looks like she's run dry.

340
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,696
It's better to trade her for cash,

341
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,265
and then I can sell that
ramen shop too.

342
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,878
<i>I can't stay here anymore...</i>

343
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,516
<i>I can't risk hurting</i>
<i>Ikumatsu anymore...</i>

344
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,119
<i>And more importantly...</i>

345
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,221
<i>she makes my determination sway.</i>

346
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,123
<i>I hate them all!</i>

347
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,993
Oh, look a new guy, eh?

348
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,728
Do you want some
bread crust?

349
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,798
<i>We can party with</i>
<i>the money, huh?</i>

350
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,901
What are you talking about?

351
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,837
We're going to use the money for
the rebellion, remember?

352
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,838
Yeah, right, bro.

353
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,774
You're just going to
lose it all gambling!

354
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,717
Why is her delivery bike
still here...?

355
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,354
Stop!
Just a minute, guys.

356
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,089
Hold on just a minute!

357
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,357
Yeah, just a minute.

358
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,225
We're looking for
an Exclusionist Rebel

359
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,760
who's been spotted around here.

360
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,329
We'd really appreciate your
cooperation in this matter.

361
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,697
What are you guys doing?

362
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,099
Are you on the job?

363
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,534
And that?
What's in there?

364
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:02,868
Porno mags?

365
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,805
Do you guys mind if we take
a look inside of it there?

366
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,140
Yikes! What are the
Shinsengumi doing here?

367
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,608
Wait!
Stop right there!

368
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,911
If they find out what we're doing,
they'll arrest us! Hurry!

369
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,045
There's no doubt about it!

370
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,580
Katsura must be hiding in there!

371
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,815
After them...

372
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:20,352
Katsura!

373
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,787
But how?!

374
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,622
Die now, Katsura!

375
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,757
Katsura?

376
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,258
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

377
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,560
<i>that was The Katsura?!</i>

378
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,095
The Kotaro Katsura?!

379
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,964
The real deal rebel fighter!

380
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,466
The Prince of Madness...

381
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,800
Kotaro Katsura?

382
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,534
We're in trouble!

383
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,369
Ditch the palanquin and run!

384
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,739
Greetings Sirs,
I am bringing you...

385
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,375
Your Full Course desserts!

386
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,416
I have just two things to tell you.

387
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,019
One; Don't ever pose as a
rebel fighter again.

388
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,590
Two; Never set a foot in
that ramen shop again...

389
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,027
Violate either of these rules,
and I promise that I,

390
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:05,064
Kotaro Katsura, will come to
collect your lives!

391
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,299
This is Unit One reporting.

392
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,268
We have found Katsura!
Send backup immediately.

393
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,170
Katsura!

394
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,806
It looks like we don't have
time to chat...

395
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,009
But Ikumatsu, thank you
so much for everything.

396
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,210
And listen to me...

397
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,179
I'm very sorry...

398
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,580
I knew the whole time...

399
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,750
I'm just like you, I guess...

400
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,720
I can't just ignore someone
who's in trouble

401
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,255
when they're right
in front of me...

402
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:30,990
I'm a fool...

403
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,859
and that's why you
shouldn't apologize.

404
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,429
I see.

405
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,398
Then let me just say this...

406
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,801
‐Thank you so much.
‐Thank you so much.

407
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,405
Katsura!

408
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,740
Huh?

409
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:07,593
Hm?

410
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,795
Good mor‐!

411
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,964
Oh, hello, Gin, long time no see.

412
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:12,965
Hey...

413
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,100
I got paid for the first time
in a while, so...

414
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,636
Let's see, what shall I have...?

415
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,338
Huh?
Wait!

416
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,574
I don't remember soba noodles
being on the menu?

417
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:24,977
Care to try some?

418
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,408
<i>A humid city where it rains</i>
<i>constantly all year long...</i>

419
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,576
<i>That was our little nest...</i>

420
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:08,781
<i>It may have seemed like</i>
<i>a dirty sewer to others...</i>

421
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,183
<i>but it was a great place to</i>
<i>live for rats.</i>

422
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:14,953
Papa!

423
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,526
The parasitic alien will take
over any organism,

424
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,428
from humans to dogs
and cats, as its host.

425
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:24,596
Ready!

426
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:29,902
If I don't stop it,
then who will?

427
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,904
G‐Gintoki...

428
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,038
I'm going with you!

429
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,541
Aliens just ain't shiiit!

430
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,418
Just tell them that it's from
Umibozu the Exterminator.
