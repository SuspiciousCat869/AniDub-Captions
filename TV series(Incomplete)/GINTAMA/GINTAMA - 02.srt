1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,011
You're not a bad fighter.

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,180
You must be a
ex‐exclusionist rebel.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,382
And you're a former gangster,
aren't you?

4
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,185
Did you dye your hair to look tough
because your hairline's receding?

5
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,320
You're one to talk with
that weird curly hair of yours?

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,855
That's pretty heartless!

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,925
I didn't choose to be born with my hair
doing somersaults, and stuff like that!

8
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,927
This is the end
of the line for you.

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,495
Prepare to die!

10
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,797
Shishimura, you should look
behind you.

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:31,865
Do you take me for a fool?

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,634
I'm not falling for... huh!

13
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,369
Hey! We're still under
the Sword Ban!

14
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,103
What are you doing?

15
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:37,971
Uh, well, nothing, this is... uh...

16
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,273
‐Huh?
‐Oh!

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,941
That was a nice catch.

18
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:43,310
Oh, so you're practicing
for a sideshow?

19
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,314
Yes, exactly, sideshow!
Right buddy?

20
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,883
Well then...

21
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,612
‐Oh?
‐Whats this?

22
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:26,446
What are you doing?

23
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,016
Sitting like a pair of girls
who've just been heart broken,

24
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,451
wanting to run dramatically
toward the sunset?

25
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,586
Hey, Gin!

26
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,488
I'm so sorry, Gin.

27
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,189
Kato has left us.

28
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,758
Kato who?

29
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,493
Oh, the client we had.

30
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:42,129
Hey, Gin!
Just help me aready!

31
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,964
Well, I expected as much.

32
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,966
We're all getting used
to working for nothing.

33
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,101
There's no point in
being down about it.

34
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:48,802
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

35
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,638
Honestly, I didn't think it
would work out to begin with.

36
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,506
Come on.

37
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,874
Gin, wait!

38
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,610
<i>What a day.</i>

39
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,980
I didn't know that Gin could possibly
be this cold hearted and unfeeling.

40
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,715
He's always been this way.

41
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,683
He doesn't do anything
when you ask him for help.

42
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,453
Kagura, what are you doing here?

43
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,754
Why are you in my house?

44
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,090
And why are you eating up
all of my rice?

45
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,792
I'm here to pimp your rice.

46
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,026
What does that even mean?

47
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,395
Is this really something
to be upset about?

48
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,663
Oh, hi, sis.

49
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,467
<i>Otae, Shinpachi's big sister.</i>

50
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:24,337
<i>She's working part‐time in order to</i>
<i>protect the dojo her father left behind.</i>

51
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,972
Gin relies on you
more than you know,

52
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,408
and if you can't believe in him,
then who will?

53
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:32,379
Well, I think you give him
far too much credit, Otae.

54
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,183
Like I've been saying,
you can't trust a man like him,

55
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,785
one who has the eyes
of a dead fish.

56
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,356
You're the one that can't be trusted,
you filthy stalker!

57
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,158
I can't believe Kondo
is still stalking her.

58
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,361
Yeah, I'm way beyond
being tired of it at this point.

59
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,998
I wonder what Gin
is doing right about now.

60
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,938
<i>The Hiccup Bar</i>.

61
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,583
‐Do you want some?
‐Oh...

62
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,019
What... what is that?

63
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,822
Rice with sweet red beans,
tossed in chocolate syrup.

64
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,924
I'm... I'm good thanks.

65
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,835
This stuff is great.

66
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,771
It helps you forget your worries,
for just one moment.

67
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,375
But once tomorrow comes,
everything comes back to you

68
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,079
and when it does, everything will be
harder to cope with, isn't that right?

69
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:44,151
There are some things in the world
you just can't run away from.

70
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,554
Especially, the things you want
to forget the most.

71
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,262
Maybe I just wanted
an excuse to forget.

72
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,429
An excuse?

73
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,270
I told you about
how I lost my job,

74
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,940
my house, my family, and
everything that mattered, didn't I?

75
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:13,313
<i>Up until then, I used to be just a</i>
<i>regular salesman for a regular company.</i>

76
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,449
<i>I kept working day after day</i>
<i>to make my family happy,</i>

77
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,085
<i>and we were finally able</i>
<i>to afford our own house.</i>

78
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,687
<i>Things were really great.</i>

79
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,923
<i>If it was for the sake</i>
<i>of my family,</i>

80
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,358
<i>I thought I could do anything.</i>

81
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,628
<i>Everything happened so suddenly.</i>

82
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:32,732
<i>One day I was fired from my company,</i>
<i>and it was totally out of the blue.</i>

83
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,467
<i>I was upset, so I got drunk,</i>

84
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:39,139
<i>and then these guys took advantage</i>
<i>of that to stamp my seal on a contract.</i>

85
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,076
<i>They waved the contract I don't even</i>
<i>remember signing in my face,</i>

86
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,744
<i>telling us to leave our home.</i>

87
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,381
<i>Eventually, my wife decided she</i>
<i>had had enough of their harassment</i>

88
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,184
<i>and so she left and took</i>
<i>my daughter with her.</i>

89
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,594
I said that something happened
to me every week, remember?

90
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,596
What do you think
happened last week?

91
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,364
I don't know.

92
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,935
‐Is that a letter?
‐Yes.

93
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,904
My daughter sent me a letter

94
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,073
right before my eviction from home.

95
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:20,747
<i>"Daddy, I want to come</i>
<i>back home to you soon."</i>

96
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,794
By then, I had already
given up on everything.

97
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:39,132
But after reading her letter, I really
wanted to give things another try.

98
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,535
Isn't it stupid?

99
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,638
Hoping that if I got
my house back,

100
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,406
everything would go back
to the way it was.

101
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,340
It's so silly.

102
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,177
But now I understand.

103
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,213
I'm a total failure.

104
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,615
Even though I worked so hard.

105
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:56,616
Let's go.

106
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,318
But... but...

107
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:00,687
Thank you very much!

108
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,225
Hey, aren't you
forgetting something?

109
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,493
Um...

110
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:24,277
Hey, so... I'm actually
unemployed right now.

111
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,012
So can we at least split the bill?

112
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,147
We are going now, Kato!

113
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,515
Going? Go where?

114
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:29,916
Huh? Come on.

115
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,785
Don't you want to get
the contract back?

116
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,753
Do... does that mean...?

117
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,388
I am Odd Jobs Gin.

118
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,923
I'll do anything for...
Brrp...

119
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,460
I don't feel so good.

120
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,164
Can we postpone the raid
until tomorrow?

121
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:47,434
‐Ehh?
‐I think I drank too much.

122
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,303
It feels like the whole world
is shaking beneath my feet.

123
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,606
No, this is an earthquake.
At least I think.

124
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,175
It is one.

125
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,210
‐Eh?
‐I can't hold it in.

126
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,780
Oh, no, I feel like
I might also... urgh...!

127
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,650
You don't have to be
that sympathetic. Oh God!

128
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,623
Man, what a headache!

129
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,093
This is a such a bad hangover.

130
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,994
I need some water.

131
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,529
Gin is the greatest.

132
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,399
I knew things would end up
this way from the beginning.

133
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,834
What are you talking about?

134
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,837
You were just complaining
about how cold hearted Gin was!

135
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,405
Oh! What about you, then?

136
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,774
Didn't you say he doesn't do
anything to help at all?

137
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,476
Can the two of you
just shut up?

138
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,111
Shut up, that's enough.

139
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,779
Are you trying to do my head in?

140
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,883
Oh, well, here it is.

141
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,887
So we're here to get Kato's
contract back, isn't that right?

142
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,089
But how are we going
to sneak in there?

143
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,291
Sneak?
We're not sneaking in there!

144
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,826
‐What?
‐We're going to break in there!

145
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,328
And you know what that means.

146
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,364
It means that we can just storm on in
through the front gate!

147
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,999
Wait! No, Gin!

148
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,768
Here's Gintoki!

149
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,071
‐There he goes!
‐Jack Torrence?

150
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,373
You're impersonating Jack Torrence
from "The Shining?"

151
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,242
Hello!
Is there anyone there?

152
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,944
You don't need to let them
know we're here.

153
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,579
This is very strange.

154
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,249
There doesn't seem to be
anyone here at all.

155
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,627
‐Oh.
‐Oh.

156
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,166
Oh, the food is still warm.

157
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,468
Someone must have been here
until a moment ago.

158
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:29,736
You're very right.

159
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,404
‐It's piping hot.
‐Huh?

160
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,472
Is this really meat?

161
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,240
I mean, It's just so tender!

162
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,676
Hey, guys!
What do you think you're doing?

163
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,113
Come on, we're not supposed
to waste food, are we?

164
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,548
Yeah, you gotta enjoy the process!

165
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,049
You guys are a bunch of pigs!

166
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,751
What if the food's poisoned?

167
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,885
Did you think of that?

168
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,921
<i>Relax.</i>
<i>Of course, it isn't poisoned.</i>

169
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,589
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

170
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,857
‐Oh!
‐Oh!

171
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,125
‐Huh?
‐Oh!

172
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:58,098
So these are the mice, the ones that
have been snooping around this house?

173
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,532
Yes, Mr. Kariya.

174
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,267
Is that Kato I see?

175
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,836
What are you doing here?

176
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,370
Well, I...

177
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:09,242
Hey, listen guys, aren't you embarrassed
for laying such a predictable trap as this?

178
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:12,745
Says the person that got caught
by such a predictable trap as this?

179
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,216
I wouldn't have minded if the food
had a little more seasoning!

180
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,917
Enough, will you just listen to us?

181
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,018
No, you listen to us!

182
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,221
Give us Kato's contract back or else!

183
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,288
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

184
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,389
The contract?

185
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,125
You mean to say you came
all this way just for that?

186
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,861
So... what if we did?

187
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:34,100
Shishimura, it looks like you
overestimated them now, doesn't it?

188
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,869
My apologies, Mr. Kariya.

189
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,737
Let's go.
We don't have much time.

190
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,239
But, what about the intruders?

191
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,607
Leave them here.

192
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,611
Oh, Kato, don't you worry.

193
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:48,248
Soon, your house will be
the very least of your worries!

194
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:52,051
Not that it matters cause you fools
are going to be buried alive.

195
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,853
‐Buried alive?
‐Buried alive?

196
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,190
<i>Launch sequence initiated.</i>

197
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,895
<i>Jackson Hole One,</i>
<i>preparing for take off.</i>

198
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,199
This is extreme drone piloting!

199
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,333
Yeah, dude!

200
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,476
Oh! Oh!

201
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,019
Feast your eyes
upon this view of the Capital,

202
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,154
because this is the last
time you’ll ever see it.

203
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,661
It's no use!

204
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:35,762
Help me, you guys!

205
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,330
Why are you all still eating?

206
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,666
Hey, Kagura!
You need to go help him.

207
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,234
You're from the Yato clan!

208
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,468
I'm not falling for that!

209
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,271
I'm not moving an inch until
we finish all of the food.

210
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,140
These people...
Uh...

211
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,142
Hey, Elizabeth!

212
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,743
What are you doing here?

213
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,379
Ah, then Cobra
must be here too, right?

214
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,782
My name is Katsura, not Cobra.

215
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,384
Gintoki while you guys
were living it up in here,

216
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,420
we snuck in the back
and found something.

217
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,222
We came across this
when we were searching the safe.

218
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,557
What's that?
You found it?

219
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,059
You found Kato's contract?

220
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,163
I don't know what you're talking about,
but here, take a look at this.

221
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,465
Well, I would, but the thing is...

222
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,767
I'm not very good
at reading the small print.

223
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,937
So what do you think
this all means, Gintoki?

224
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,306
I honestly have no idea.

225
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,141
Then let me enlighten you.

226
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,545
The plan is to raze
the Capital to the ground.

227
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:26,713
‐What?!
‐What?!

228
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,580
A rave in the Capital?

229
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,616
He said "raze," idiot!

230
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,785
Let me give you
a brief explanation.

231
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:37,824
<i>They're looking for a fault line</i>
<i>in the earth's crust,</i>

232
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,694
<i>which they will stimulate</i>
<i>using the Amanto made device</i>

233
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,263
<i>to trigger a giant artificial earthquake.</i>

234
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,500
<i>And with it they will level</i>
<i>the entire capital!</i>

235
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,535
Oh, oh, no.

236
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,005
Its as if they're some kind
of villains from some anime.

237
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,674
But why would they want
to do something like that?

238
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,443
Those people who were
with Kariya are land sharks.

239
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:02,181
Their evil plan is to force people
to sell their land for mere pennies.

240
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,517
And their goal is the old city?

241
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,987
Buildings that weren't constructed
by Amanto are not very strong.

242
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,357
In the event of a large earthquake,
they likely won't stand a chance.

243
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,993
We have to do something to
stop them, or the Capital will...

244
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,664
But the main problem is, we have
no idea where the fault line is located.

245
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,666
Didn't you find any clues, though?

246
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,834
Well, unfortunately, we didn't.

247
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,336
So what are we going to do?

248
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:27,273
We don't have time to run around the
entire Capital looking for the land sharks

249
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,108
who want to destroy it
with an earthquake!

250
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,244
‐Oh!
‐Kagura!

251
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,445
You've had enough food!

252
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,213
Stop eating and break us out now!

253
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,181
You got it!

254
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,184
Hi‐yah!

255
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,421
I don't believe it!
Why didn't you do that earlier?!

256
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,189
‐Hey, Kato!
‐Yes... yes!

257
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,090
Where is your house?

258
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,091
Take us there!

259
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,228
Hey, Gintoki!

260
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,430
Where are you going?

261
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,799
It's very dangerous
to go on your own!

262
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,501
I know that, but we still have
to go there and stop them!

263
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,836
See you later, Cobra.

264
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,905
My name is Katsura, not Cobra!

265
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,174
Hey, Gin! Why are we going
to Kato's house?

266
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,409
Basically, their goal is to clear the land
in the capital and then take it all

267
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,746
for themselves to sell
for high prices, I am right?

268
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,081
I believe that's right!

269
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,615
Then why do you think
they tricked Kato

270
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,651
and took his house
first before the rest?

271
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,953
Well, I guess it was...

272
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,521
Ah! I get it!

273
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,090
It must be where
the fault line is!

274
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,191
That's exactly right!

275
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,127
So then Kato getting fired
and losing his house was all...

276
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,730
It was all a part
of their evil plan.

277
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,931
That's terrible.

278
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,233
‐Now, enough of this chit chat!
‐Hurry!

279
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,001
Uh, hey, excuse us!

280
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,036
What's up?

281
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,672
If you have something to say,
Kato, you better say it now!

282
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:33,539
He's right!

283
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,374
There's absolutely no time to lose!

284
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,809
The thing is that...

285
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,045
We're going the wrong direction.

286
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,913
‐What's that?
‐What's that?

287
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,798
<i>This right here is the earthquake</i>
<i>machine that was developed</i>

288
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:02,301
<i>utilizing the technology</i>
<i>of Drifting Star!</i>

289
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,105
This is the device of our dreams that will
realize Mr. Kariya's ambitions!

290
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,908
This will mark the very
beginning of our reign.

291
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,144
‐Start the machine!
‐Yes!

292
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,721
Excavation beam
has been activated!

293
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,690
The ETA is ten minutes
to reach the target!

294
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,094
Onward! No one can possibly
stop us now!

295
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,429
<i>Intruders!</i>
<i>Get them! Get them!</i>

296
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,064
‐What?
‐What?

297
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,767
We're here for an inspection!

298
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,102
We're the Shinsengumi!

299
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,570
Lay down your arms!

300
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,606
Government mongrels!

301
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,213
Oh, so you intend to resist
the Shinsengumi?

302
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,247
Interesting!

303
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,349
Isao Kondo, ready!

304
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,952
Toshiro Hijikata, ready!

305
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,721
Sogo Okita, ready!

306
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,490
Attack!

307
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,459
Hold it right there!

308
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,595
Have you gone mad?

309
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:05,231
Don't you know we're here
to take you down, you villain!

310
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,099
Let me spell it out for you.

311
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,869
This land right here is
in Drifting Star territory.

312
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:14,207
If you take a single step into this house,
it'll be an intergalactic incident.

313
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,844
‐Extraterritoriality, huh?
‐No way!

314
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:21,047
Uh, what was extraterritoriality again?

315
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,382
If any of you want
to enter this house,

316
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,752
you need to do so through
the official procedures.

317
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,357
Okita, what are you doing?

318
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,794
Well, if I blow this house to bits,
then we don't have to go inside it.

319
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:35,795
Isn't that right, sir?

320
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,030
Who do you think you are,
Michael Bay?

321
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:39,732
Heh! Now that you understand,

322
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,200
why don't you go
ahead and leave?

323
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,773
Thank you for your attention!

324
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,475
Now make way
for the main event!

325
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,777
‐Is that...?
‐Odd Jobs Gin?

326
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,412
He's here.

327
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,147
‐Leave the rest to us!
‐Oh ah!

328
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,752
Odd Jobs Gin is here and he will
take care of all your problems!

329
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,223
He's a civilian so he can do
whatever he likes!

330
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,025
This is starting to feel good.

331
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,397
Mr. Kariya, we should go inside.

332
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,532
Hold on!

333
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,702
It's time that you and I
finally settled this.

334
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,171
Huh, stop playing the role
of my rival.

335
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,908
‐You're just Mr. Sideshow!
‐You!

336
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,116
‐ETA is five minutes to target!
‐Good.

337
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,818
We'll escape as soon as
it reaches the epicenter!

338
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,354
‐Right!
‐Machine, to the surface!

339
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,460
‐Earthquake?
‐No! Did they already...?

340
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:44,997
What?

341
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,511
What the heck
is this contraption?

342
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,846
Does this really belong
in this anime show!?

343
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:04,016
This is too much, even for
a special two part episode!

344
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,819
So this is the device that
Cobra was talking about.

345
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,424
You get an A for effort,

346
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:15,328
but our plan is already on the verge
of reaching ultimate success.

347
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,130
No! The Capital is going to be...

348
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,934
Shinpachi!

349
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,004
I'm not letting you
get away this time.

350
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,439
You...

351
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,576
ETA is three minutes to target!

352
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,616
‐My... my poor house.
‐What?

353
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:37,917
‐Kato!
‐Kato!

354
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,219
Idiots! Why didn't you
take care of him?

355
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,688
Well, he didn't seem very relevant.

356
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:43,823
Go, Kato!

357
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,458
I know that you can do it!

358
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,159
But... but how?

359
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,866
Hm, I'll cut you down.

360
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:59,739
I... I don't think I can.

361
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,507
Don't run away, Kato!

362
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,010
You know what to do!

363
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,312
You have to change,
or nothing else will!

364
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,780
To change?

365
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,349
You'll never be able to run away!

366
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,453
Especially from those things
that you really want to forget!

367
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,140
<i>Dearest daddy...</i>

368
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:39,779
I will change.

369
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,793
I will change!

370
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,728
I will change!

371
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,697
Yeaaaaaah!

372
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,368
If I clear my mind, I can channel
John Cena's spirit!

373
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,269
What's this?

374
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,437
You can't even see me!

375
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,504
There is no way!

376
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:09,341
Keep my elbows close
to my body and just strike!

377
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:15,448
I will strike hard!
Yaaaaaah!

378
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,483
No way, really?

379
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,986
‐He did it!
‐He did it!

380
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,022
‐Mr. Kariya!
‐Mr. Kariya!

381
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,257
We have to get him
medical attention!

382
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,695
I'm so proud of my student!

383
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,063
He's learned so much from me!

384
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,067
Kagura, you taught him to jab,
not strike head on with a sword.

385
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,402
What are you doing, Kato?

386
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,003
Now go and stop
the earthquake machine!

387
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,605
All right, yeah!

388
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,674
Um... um...

389
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,077
Is this it?
Where is it?

390
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:54,120
Eeeek, fifty seconds left?

391
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,988
But the speed was doubled!

392
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,924
Hurry up!
I don't care how, just stop it!

393
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:00,693
Ahhh! This is it.

394
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,428
Um... is this... or this one?

395
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,096
This must be it!

396
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,266
Come on!
It just broke!

397
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,735
‐It just broke?! This is so cliche!!
‐Nooooo!

398
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,139
Stop right there!

399
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,874
I'm not finished with you...!

400
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,041
Shut up, you plebian!

401
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,743
I don't have time to waste on you!

402
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,211
Just one kick, man?

403
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,984
Oh!

404
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,886
Time to end to this!

405
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,792
It... it has stopped.

406
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,694
Hey, let's get out of here!

407
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,962
All... all right!

408
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,902
‐Yahoo!
‐They did it!

409
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,774
Hey you guys, you know if you take
a single step across that line,

410
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,076
you're no longer
on foreign soil, right?

411
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:56,415
You know... Gintoki never
ceases to impress.

412
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,050
My side hurts.

413
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:07,393
This was our home...
our home.

414
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,031
What do I do now?

415
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,867
Kato, you shouldn't worry
so much about your house.

416
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,268
But it...

417
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,538
You are a changed man
now, aren't you?

418
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,674
Oh, yes!

419
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,847
‐Oh!
‐Oh!

420
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,217

Kato's been gaining popularity in
the entertainment industry recently

433

as a dancing samurai singer.
