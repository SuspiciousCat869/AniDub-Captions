1
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,908
<i>Hey guys, I'm home.</i>

2
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,644
Gin's back home, you guys.

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,081
I feel like shit.

4
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,653
Somebody... somebody bring me
some strawberry milk.

5
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,989
Wait, what's this?

6
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,657
Is nobody up yet?

7
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:26,193
Man, those useless lazy bums.

8
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,630
Hey, where's my strawberry... mi...?

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,536
I guess I really had
way too much to drink.

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,738
Sadaharu looks awfully huge today.

11
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,807
Hey, Shinpachi, get your head
out of there right away

12
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,110
and bring me
my strawberry milk, please.

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,478
Are you stupid or something?

14
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,380
Can you not see
the situation that we're in?!

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,180
It's Sadaharu!

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,983
Sadaharu suddenly turned
giant overnight!

17
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,451
Keep your voice down.

18
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,320
Men and dogs are just the same.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,354
Give them two or three days,

20
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,556
and they grow so quickly
you won't be able to recognize them!

21
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,458
Although you're still just
as useless as ever

22
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,460
no matter how many days go by!

23
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,758
Sadaharu really loves strawberry milk.

24
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,261
He's gotten bigger,
but his personality hasn't changed.

25
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,497
How in the world did he
end up like this though?

26
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,298
It's because the two of you
just gave him

27
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,067
too much calcium
without a thought.

28
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,536
Don't underestimate
the power of calcium.

29
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,471
Calcium solves just
about everything!

30
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,408
But it doesn't seem
to solve your laziness.

31
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,109
Anyway, what are we going to do?

32
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,911
He's gotten so huge.

33
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,413
Ah, leave it to me, Shinpachi.

34
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,214
I've got just the thing.

35
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,183
Ta dee da da ta‐daa!

36
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,986
"The Bow wow Translator!"

37
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,954
With this device,
we can understand

38
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,691
what the dog is trying to say
whenever it barks!

39
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,959
Where did you get
such a cool device?

40
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,828
From an old man
at the bar last night.

41
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,030
I traded my edamame beans for this.

42
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,533
Did you tell them they were
magic beans or something?!

43
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,303
With this device, we might be able
to figure out why he became so big

44
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,671
and how to revert it.

45
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,941
Sadaharu, tell me how
did you get so big?

46
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,911
Hey, say something!

47
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,985
I think this device really works.

48
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:39,853
Damn dog!

49
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,122
That's no way
to treat your master!

50
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,357
It's my turn to try next!

51
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,161
I'm always taking good care of Sadaharu,
so he'll be really nice to me.

52
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:53,133
Sadaharu, you can now thank me for
everything that I've done for you!

53
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,571
Damn it! How the hell
do you know about that?

54
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,338
Calm down, Kagura.

55
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,107
I ranked 8th, you know.

56
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,510
I guess it's up to me now.

57
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,180
I mean, I'm the one who has taken care
of Sadaharu the most after all.

58
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,850
Sadaharu, you're going
to listen to me, right?

59
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,185
What?

60
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,988
How can such a white dog
have such a black heart?!

61
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,456
And what's with the long comment?!

62
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,325
That one bark
holds this much meaning?

63
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,427
Damn! I can't stop
commenting on everything!

64
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,896
This thing is a piece of junk!

65
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,532
Give me back my beans,
you stupid old man!

66
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,237
<i>It hurts?</i>

67
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,139
Maybe it's broken.

68
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,008
Well, my hangover's also killing me!

69
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,243
<i>Help me?</i>

70
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:38,044
We're the only ones who need help.

71
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,379
What are we going to do?

72
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,314
And what's with all that noise
and shaking?

73
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,350
Is some kid throwing
a tantrum or something?

74
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,558
What is that?

75
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,226
A dog?
Is that a dog?

76
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,829
<i>Moving on to our next story...</i>

77
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,332
<i>we just found out that Maya Sizitzy,</i>
<i>a popular weather forecaster,</i>

78
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,768
<i>filed for divorce last month.</i>

79
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,504
<i>‐Her marriage lasted...</i>
‐See, I knew it wouldn't last.

80
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,741
I knew she would end up
getting divorced from the start.

81
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,709
Difference in values, she says?

82
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:13,380
Bullshit, a difference in values
makes marriage interesting.

83
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,848
Right, Komako?

84
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,150
Oh, really?

85
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,118
Look who's talking!

86
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,953
You haven't even experienced love!

87
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:23,590
What's wrong with a shrine maiden
keeping her virginity, huh?

88
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,660
Anyways, I'm not a big flirt
like you are, big sister.

89
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,962
Hey, what was that,
you little brat?!

90
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,431
Who do you think keeps
the bread on the table?!

91
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,267
The only thing a shrine maiden does
is lie around and pray all day.

92
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,337
If I can just make money come
raining down by just praying,

93
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,638
I'd pray all day too!

94
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,106
We're not shrine maidens anymore!

95
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,042
We have to get on with our life
as a strong, independent,

96
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,410
and respectable women.

97
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,845
Respectable?

98
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,514
What's respectable about a shrine
maiden who ditched God's child

99
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,615
to work at a hostess bar?

100
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,917
You know I had
no choice back then!

101
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,819
I gave up my life
as shrine maiden

102
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,522
and decided to live
as a hostess bar maiden.

103
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,857
You haven't given it up though.

104
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,892
You're just using it
to your full advantage.

105
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:02,162
Foolish men flock to me just because
I dress up like a shrine maiden.

106
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,097
Be quiet Komako,
keep that down.

107
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,966
<i>And now, we take you to Kabukicho,</i>

118
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,457

119
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,192

00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,231
<i>I apologize to everyone in the world!</i>

123
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,401

129
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,647
<i>That's what the media does!</i>

130
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,316

<i>Go away!</i>

131
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:59,119
<i>‐Hurry up and go away!</i>
<i>‐We're not leaving.</i>

132
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,655

00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,359
I never thought my fly
would be wipe open

149
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,828
on a national television broadcast.

150
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:42,962
That's what you're worried about?

151
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,930
What will you do?

152
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,266
It's become a huge incident.

153
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,035
The Sadaharu cookies
aren't selling at all either.

154
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,070
Get out of here.

155
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,872
Who gave you permission
to make Sadaharu products?

156
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,910
Well, we've put you
through a lot of trouble.

157
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,045
Maybe it's time for us to leave.

158
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,649
People who can't mind their manners
have no right to keep a pet, do they?

159
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,250
But Gin...

160
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:09,789
You know, abandoning such an
enormous pet isn't going to be easy at all.

161
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:10,957
Abandon him?

162
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,859
Don't be ridiculous.

163
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:17,297
<i>If I intended to abandon him, I wouldn't</i>
<i>have taken him in from the start.</i>

164
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,366
I'm so sorry, Sadaharu.

165
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,801
This umbrella's a bit small,
but bear with it.

166
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,939
Sadaharu, you don't have
to worry about anything.

167
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:29,109
No matter what anyone says,
I will never abandon you.

168
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,511
Sadaharu, no matter
how huge you become,

169
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,913
I will protect you,
Sadaharu, always.

170
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,048
Understand?

171
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,585
Sadaharu!

172
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,653
Get out of town, you freak!

173
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,089
What the hell are you doing?

174
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,358
I'll report you to
the Animal Protection Group!

175
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,626
That's not an animal!

176
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,695
It's a monster,
a giant monster!

177
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,929
Stop it everyone!

178
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,532
Sadaharu has a bigger body
than the average dog,

179
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,300
but he also has a very big heart!

180
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,736
Shut up, you monster keeper!

181
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,992
I told you it was a freak!

182
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,161
We should've killed it
while we had the chance!

183
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,555
Sadaharu, please just stop!

184
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,789
Stop! No! Down!

185
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,224
Shake! Beg! Sit!

186
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,625
Stay! Pee!

187
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:53,993
It's no use.

188
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,829
He doesn't even hear me at all!

189
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,797
How did this happen?

190
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,066
Gin, what should I do?

191
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,368
Gin!

192
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,071
‐How do you intend to take....?
‐We really need you to start talking...

193
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,106
<i>...from the heart. We want to know</i>
<i>exactly what happened.</i>

194
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,241
Please get out of the way!

195
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,643
We don't have time
for this nonsense!

196
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,744
Everyone...

197
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,379
please settle down.

198
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,583
I will expose everything,
the entire truth, in the studio.

199
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,650
Damn you!

200
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,320
<i>Why are you selling out</i>
<i>your friends?</i>

201
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,221
<i>Look at them!</i>

202
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,755
<i>This is the kind of people they are!</i>

203
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,958
<i>Is the camera on?</i>
<i>Are you getting this?</i>

204
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,893
Damn! We're not getting
anywhere like this, Gin!

205
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,995
If this continues,
Sadaharu is gonna be...

206
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:33,633
<i>Rock‐a‐bye‐reporters</i>
<i>with the cameras.</i>

207
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:39,706
<i>When the flute blows,</i>
<i>the reporters will sleep.</i>

208
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:44,344
<i>‐And down goes the reporters...</i>
‐I feel so sleepy all of a sudden.

209
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,581
‐Hey, hey, what's going on?
‐What the...?

210
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,051
Whoa! What's this?

211
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,354
Sadaharu?
It's a mini Sadaharu!

212
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:55,889
How unusual.

213
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,591
Komako is rarely friendly
to anyone other than us.

214
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,362
How do you do today, gentlemen?

215
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:06,199
We are the lovely shrine
maiden sisters, Ané and Moné.

216
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,637
We are the ones who entrusted
that huge dog to you.

217
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,515
<i>‐You there, monster, pull over!</i>
‐What?

218
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,051
<i>Do you have any idea how fast</i>
<i>you're walking that dog?</i>

219
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,553
<i>Stop right there and pull over!</i>

220
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,055
Does it look like I'm walking
my dog, asshole?

221
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,124
I'd have stopped a
long time ago, if I could.

222
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,625
You really are an idiot, aren't you?

223
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,827
<i>Okay, we'll arrest you</i>
<i>for obstruction of justice.</i>

224
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,863
<i>You have just hurt</i>
<i>a police officer's feelings.</i>

225
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,631
You're an idiot,
a real idiot!

226
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,866
Then you leave me no choice.

227
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,734
I'll just stop you by force.

228
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,169
Don't do it!

229
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,871
<i>Hasta la vista.</i>

230
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,148
Hasta la vista to you!

231
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,583
Oh, that was close.

232
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,517
What's this?!

233
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,653
Hey! Let's go, you sadist!

234
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,288
No, you're the sadist.

235
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,325
Hey, Okita... look out now!

236
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,527
‐No!
‐Hijikata?

237
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,797
Fire!

238
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,334
Hijikata, you bastard!

239
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,404
Things are really getting
out of hand, Gin!

240
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,006
Don't you worry, Shinpachi.

241
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,508
We're just good citizens who
took care of an abandoned dog.

242
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,810
We've done nothing wrong.

243
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,945
The Dog Deity
is a servant of the gods

244
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,248
and the guardian of
the Golden Dragon Hole.

245
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,483
The Dragon Hole is the largest
of the sacred holes

246
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,685
where the power
of the earth flows out.

247
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,854
Hey, hey, why did you
show up out of nowhere

248
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,723
and start talking all this nonsense?

249
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,791
You can go talk about
butt holes somewhere else.

250
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,493
No one's talking about buttholes!

251
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,030
<i>We are the shrine maidens</i>
<i>who have guarded</i>

252
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,332
<i>the Golden Dragon Hole</i>
<i>for generations.</i>

253
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,735
<i>But</i> <i>the</i> <i>Amanto</i> <i>drove</i> <i>us</i>
<i>out</i> <i>of</i> <i>our</i> <i>sacred</i> <i>land</i>

254
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,036
<i>and built the Sky Terminal</i>

255
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,971
<i>over the Golden Dragon Hole.</i>

256
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,409
So, we lost our jobs and couldn't afford
to look after God's Child,

257
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,177
and we had to give him away.

258
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,279
You dumped God's Child
because you were broke?

259
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,314
We had no choice!

260
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,849
We were dirt poor!

261
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,852
But why did he change size
all of a sudden?

262
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:08,421
The Dog Deity is
a calm creature by nature,

263
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,156
but once its strength is unleashed,

264
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,126
it transforms into
the horrific Deity Beast.

265
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,695
But it's hard to believe
it was awakened without ceremony.

266
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,963
What ceremony?

267
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,266
A crimson fruit and the blood
of a mountain goat

268
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,670
shall release the power
of God's Child.

269
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,905
A crimson fruit and blood
of a mountain goat?

270
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,075
"Blood of a mountain goat"
refers to the breast milk.

271
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,410
"Crimson Fruit" means...

272
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,545
we were feeding him strawberries,
weren't we?

273
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,781
Cheap, nearly rotten ones.

274
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,116
‐Strawberries.
‐And milk.

275
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,619
‐Strawberries.
‐And milk.

276
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,988
Lots of strawberry milk!

277
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,956
I'll give you strawberry milk!

278
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,192
So please just calm down!

279
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,761
<i>Now, it appears that</i>
<i>the evil giant dog</i>

280
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,698
<i>has climbed onto the top</i>
<i>of the Edo City Dome</i>

281
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,866
<i>and today's scheduled</i>
<i>baseball game,</i>

282
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,569
<i>Aliens versus Gangsters,</i>
<i>will be cancelled.</i>

283
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,871
<i>‐The fans are furious.</i>
<i>‐Hijikata, die!</i>

284
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,074
<i>‐You're the one that will die.</i>
<i>‐Those aren't fans.</i>

285
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:05,011
<i>The giant dog's owners will be responsible</i>
<i>for the huge financial losses</i>

286
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,346
<i>resulting from the cancellation</i>
<i>of today's...</i>

287
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,329
<i>The giant dog's owners will be responsible</i>
<i>for the huge financial losses</i>

288
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,665
<i>resulting from the cancellation</i>
<i>of today's...</i>

289
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,167
This is just crazy!

290
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,902
We can't have him
causing any more damage!

291
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,904
All the money I saved by working
at the hostess club!

292
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,273
I'm gonna lose the house
my sugar daddy bought me!

293
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,242
Hey, Gin!

294
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,977
Sadaharu!

295
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,448
Right... okay, listen to me.

296
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,916
We need you to buy us
some time

297
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,953
until we complete the spell
to undo his transformation.

298
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,021
One minute.

299
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,189
We just need one minute.

300
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,624
Hey, Gin!

301
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,094
Sadaharu... Sadaharu is suffering!

302
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,330
Please don't hurt Sadaharu!

303
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,065
He wants us to help him!

304
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,199
Don't go easy on him.

305
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,835
Attack him as if you were
trying to kill him,

306
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,004
or else, he'll... kill you.

307
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,610
No way, no way,
no freakin' way!

308
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,312
One minute?
I won't last ten seconds!

309
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,581
Come on, no one warned me
about this!

310
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,849
Who are those people?!

311
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,751
‐Those sisters are so self‐centered!
‐Hey, man!

312
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,553
Are you really chanting
the magic words?!

313
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,021
Looks like a complete joke to me!

314
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,623
Hey don't talk to us!

315
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,225
Now we have to start over
from the beginning!

316
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,294
How did the beginning go again?

317
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,930
I forgot.
Eeny, meeny... no...

318
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,005
What?!

319
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,375
‐What?!
‐Shinpachi!

320
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,281
Gin!

321
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:52,785
Sadaharu... that's enough of this!

322
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,254
Gin, stop, don't do it!

323
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,125
Sadaha...

324
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,994
‐Gin!
‐Gin, no!

325
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,733
Damn it...

326
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,102
now I'm seeing things!

327
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,643
Look out!

328
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,047
Gin!

329
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,583
Come on!
You interrupted the spell again.

330
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,521
You idiots!
This is an emergency,

331
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,690
not a time to play
a party game!

332
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,759
What? What are you trying to say?

333
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,495
Don't tell me you can't get
that flute out of your mouths.

334
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,165
Which is it,
"yes" or "no"?

335
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,933
I'm asking you which one it is!

336
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,307
It's going to get us!

337
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,443
On no, we forgot
those two back there!

338
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,510
Mone!

339
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,945
They can run like that?!

340
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:56,215
Gross! They look like some new
freaky species of animal!

341
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,651
But the thing is, they're only
exchanging carbon dioxide.

342
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,553
They're going to suffocate
each other!!

343
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:01,621
They're about to die.

344
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:02,989
They're gonna die.

345
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,759
Hey, clench your teeth!

346
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,296
‐It came out!
‐It came out!

347
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:11,397
So did my teeth!

348
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,199
Why did you tell me
to clench my teeth?!

349
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,101
Don't worry about it.
They'll grow back.

350
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,906
Hey, what are you
going to do now?

351
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,807
The flute's broken!

352
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:23,910
Komako!

353
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,646
Now that it's come to this,
our only chance is to awaken Komako

354
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,248
and pit her against Sadaharu!
Moné!

355
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,685
It's time for Abracadabra!

356
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,358
Awaken the Dog deity!

357
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,236
So tiny?!
What's with this?!

358
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,605
It's just a small mutt
with a really scary face!

359
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:53,472
What?

360
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,376
Komako is the Dog Deity of Protection!

361
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,945
No one can get past her!

362
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,618
‐Is that a sacred barrier?
‐Now!

363
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,119
Let's get out of here!

364
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,289
Now all of you have to play
catch with me.

365
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:11,857
‐Play catch?!
‐Play catch?!

366
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,494
I transferred a sacred power
into this baseball.

367
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,931
By throwing this to each other
and tracing a five‐pointed star,

368
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,534
we can make a huge magical
formation on this field.

369
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,770
The five‐pointed star represents the
relationships of Yin and Yang.

370
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,908
It's a powerful charm that cleanses
calamity from all things in the Universe.

371
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:33,045
And, if we can seal him inside, it may
revert the awakening of the Dog Deity.

372
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:37,083
Teacher, I think your lecture
has put Kagura to sleep.

373
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,487
The problem is that we'll have
to trap him within the five pointed star.

374
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,356
So that means, we'll have
to surround Sadaharu

375
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,690
and create a five‐pointed star

376
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,125
while running away
from his attacks?

377
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,493
That seems insane!

378
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,863
But if it's the only way to save
Sadaharu, we'll have to do it.

379
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,532
So, how do I play catch?

380
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,301
Yeah it's definitely insane.

381
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,125
This is no time for discussion!

382
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,093
Everyone, take your positions!

383
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,934
Okay, play boy!

384
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,138
Hey, watch where you're throwing!

385
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,673
If you drop the ball,
the sacred power will disappear!

386
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,542
You absolutely must not drop it!

387
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,577
You tell me that now?!

388
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,714
I got it!

389
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,917
Shinpachi!

390
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,920
I always knew you could do it
if you really tried!

391
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,761
Moné, catch!

392
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,435
What are you doing?!
Damn you!

393
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,136
I can make it!
I can make it!

394
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,304
I can make it!

395
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,406
Wow, Gin, way to go!

396
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,642
Kagura, heads up!

397
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,248
Shinpachi, what are you
even doing over there?!

398
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,184
It's no use.
I can't get to it!

399
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,653
What?!

400
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:21,754
She kicked it!

401
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,756
It's heading to the fifth player!

402
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,459
Hey, aren't you the fifth player?

403
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,227
‐Uh, was it me?
‐Oh, no!

404
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,628
Nobody's there!

405
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,266
Moné, you can't!

406
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,502
There's no way a dimwit like you
can handle such a fastball!

407
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:37,970
Get out of there!

408
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,105
Big sister...

409
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,073
let's put an end to this.

410
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,075
We have to finish this now.

411
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,978
<i>We're the ones who let</i>
<i>that puppy become a monster.</i>

412
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,513
<i>It's our fault.</i>

413
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,082
<i>Whatever the reason...</i>

414
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,651
<i>it was wrong of us</i>
<i>to neglect our responsibility</i>

415
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,687
<i>to look after his valuable life.</i>

416
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,289
<i>But these people</i>
<i>never abandoned him</i>

417
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,024
<i>no matter what he turned into.</i>

418
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,960
<i>They cared for him</i>
<i>and protected him...</i>

419
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,029
<i>with all their life</i>
<i>as a member of their family.</i>

420
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,232
<i>It may be too late</i>
<i>at this point...</i>

421
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:11,303
but I want to become
that puppy's family too.

422
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:14,473
That's why I won't run away
anymore, ever again!

423
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,277
I will accept
all my responsibilities.

424
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,613
I will accept that puppy
with these two hands...

425
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,282
And it still hits you
in the face!

426
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,850
Ack, the ball!

427
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,586
It's all over!!

428
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,056
It's no use.
There's no time!

429
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,530
You did very well.

430
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,733
Now leave the rest to me.

431
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,701
Sadaharu!

432
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,337
Time to wake up!

433
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,856
What's that over there?

434
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,658
A strange light is on the ground.

435
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,359
What is that?

436
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,594
Sadaharu!

437
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,964
Sadaharu!
I'm so glad...

438
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:15,434
so glad you're safe again,
Sadaharu!

439
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,038
She sure seems relieved.

440
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,307
So they truly are a real family.

441
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,443
Although it's probably
all over now.

442
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,413
There's no way they'll let him stay
after going through all this.

443
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:28,314
There's no way.

444
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:33,485
Big sister, do we have any right
to say anything after what we did?

445
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,624
Yeah, yeah, I know, even I'm not that
much of a shameless woman, after all.

446
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,360
Do as you want to.

447
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,495
If you don't want to keep him
we'll take him with us.

448
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,397
We won't abandon him anymore.

449
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,866
No worries.

450
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,402
I make quite a lot these days
at the hostess bar.

451
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,439
Oh, that's so stupid.

452
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,473
You think you need
to say all that

453
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,508
after everything we've
gone through for him?

454
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,377
You should really know better.

455
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,678
<i>Sadaharu is...</i>

456
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,283
What a really stupid show.

457
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,485
They're censoring everything now.

458
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,355
We still haven't thrown away
this piece of junk?

459
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,925
<i>Gin, hurry up or</i>
<i>we'll leave without you.</i>

460
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,059
Coming...

461
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,629
Hey, did you bring it?

462
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,864
The poop bags.

463
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:22,434
Irresponsible owners have
absolutely no right to keep a pet.

464
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,771
What? Don't woof at me.

465
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,241
You're seriously such a handful.

466
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:06,105
<i>The next episode...</i>
