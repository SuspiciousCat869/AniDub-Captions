1
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:36,797
It was a hot and humid night with lots of
mosquitoes, very much like tonight.

2
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:41,335
I was playing with some fireworks with
my friends and before we knew it,

3
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,936
it was pitch black outside.

4
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:46,073
<i>We were like, "Crap,</i>
<i>our Moms are gonna kill us!"</i>

5
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,875
So we decided to hurry back home.

6
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,445
We gathered up all of
the remaining fireworks

7
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,081
and glanced towards
our school nearby.

8
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,085
Then, it's the middle of
the frikking night right?

9
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,588
But theres a woman in a red kimono
looking right at us

10
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,090
from the window of the classrooms.

11
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,992
I was seriously freaked out.

12
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,896
but curiosity got the best of me,
so I went over and gingerly asked her,

13
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,732
"What are you doing up
this late, ma'am?"

14
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,700
And then she gave me...

15
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,169
an eerie grin and she said...

16
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,539
We have completely
run out of mayonnaise!

17
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,378
Hey, vice‐chief, what the heck‐?

18
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,580
You ruined the ending
of the ghost story, man!

19
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,282
As if I care, we're completely
out of mayonnaise!

20
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,617
Didn't I tell you to buy more?

21
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,986
What good are fried noodles
without mayo?

22
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,489
You have so much mayo
on there already!

23
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,591
They barely resemble
fried noodles anymore!

24
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,226
It's just a bunch of yellow snot!

25
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,360
Oh, no!

26
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,097
Chief?

27
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,232
My goodness!

28
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,166
Hey chief!

29
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,201
The mayonnaise made him faint!

30
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,603
This is terrible!

31
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,774
It's so stupid!

32
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,711
They're all obsessed with ghost stories
like a bunch of little snot nosed brats.

33
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,216
I'll be damned if ghosts
really existed.

34
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,357
Man, there're so many
mosquitoes these days.

35
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,259
<i>Die...</i>

36
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,261
<i>Die...</i>

37
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,197
<i>Just Die, Hijikata...</i>

38
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,333
<i>Please, just die...</i>

39
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:21,835
Die...

40
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,442
What are you doing out here
at this time of night, Okita?

41
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,142
I'm...

42
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,211
‐I'm Jogging.
‐Don't you lie to me!

43
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,281
If you ran around looking like that,
your head would catch on fire!

44
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,149
You were holding some
kinda voodoo ritual

45
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,018
to curse and kill me, weren't you?

46
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,054
You are such a self‐conscious person.

47
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,457
If you keep thinking like that, you're
gonna have a nervous breakdown.

48
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,624
Don't mock me!

49
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,363
What's the matter
with you, Hijikata?

50
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,567
Okita, did you just see
something over there?

51
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,303
No.
Nothing.

52
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,472
I'm sure I just saw...

53
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,885
This is absolutely sickening.

54
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,488
Hey, how many people
affected so far?

55
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,457
That's the eighteenth one so far.

56
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,461
So that means over half the
squad has been hit by this.

57
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,831
I've got to admit, Vice Chief,
this is getting kind of eerie.

58
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,666
No kidding, this is very strange.

59
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,436
The almighty Shinsengumi,
brought to its knees by a ghost,

60
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,238
and now everyone's
flat on their backs.

61
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,039
It's beyond embarrassing,
you know.

62
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,108
Damn it all.

63
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,109
Hijikata...

64
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,211
I wasn't taken out by a ghost.

65
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,913
I was taken out by mayonnaise!

66
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,581
That's even worse.

67
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,720
Everybody affected deliriously mentions
the woman in the red kimono.

68
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,823
Is that the same ghost Inayama was
talking about the other night?

69
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,024
Idiot!

70
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,792
There's no such thing as ghosts.

71
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:56,296
Don't underestimate the power of ghosts,
or you'll be in real trouble, Hijikata.

72
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,732
This place is obviously cursed.

73
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,468
It must be possessed
by a horrible spirit.

74
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,604
What are you talking about?

75
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,007
No, It couldn't be.

76
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,742
Hey Chief, here they are.

77
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,577
Oh, Yamazaki!
Thanks!

78
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,748
I found these three
exorcists downtown.

79
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,751
Hello.

80
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,753
Who are these weird guys?

81
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,788
Is the circus in town or something?

82
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,624
No, Hijikata, they're
here for an exorcism.

83
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,027
Hey, hey!
Are you kidding me?

84
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:28,962
These guys look so suspicious.

85
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,498
Mister, I see behind you.

86
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:32,732
What's that?

87
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,100
You see something behind me?

88
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,672
Heheh, yeah, he's done for.

89
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,141
Can I tear these bastards apart?

90
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,576
Can I, please, sir!

91
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,878
Reverent ones, do you think
can you help us?

92
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,015
I'm too scared to even go to the
bathroom by myself right now.

93
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,551
We shall take care of it, gorilla.

94
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,486
Hold on, did you just say
"gorilla" right now?

95
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,288
You just said gorilla, didn't you?

96
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,092
We were gorilla‐round
the house to check things out,

97
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,796
and I felt a very powerful spiritual
presence located here, gorilla.

98
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:03,997
No!

99
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,732
You definitely just said "gorilla"!

100
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,402
Well, why don't we gorilla‐head
and see if we can exorcise the spirit?

101
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,972
This is going to cost you a lot of
bananas though, gorilla.

102
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,507
Are you trying to coin "gorilla"
as a new catchphrase, gorilla?

103
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,910
By the way, what kind of
spirit is here, gorilla?

104
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,111
It's contagious!

105
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,480
It's um...mmm..

106
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:21,648
A factory foreman.

107
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,785
Yes, well it's the spirit of
a factory foreman

108
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,687
who died after getting stuck
in a conveyer belt.

109
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:28,788
Yes but...

110
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,424
everyone said they saw the
spirit of a woman in a kimono.

111
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,959
Sorry, what they meant was...

112
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,794
It's the spirit of a woman
who killed herself

113
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,363
because someone told her she
looked like the foreman

114
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,331
who got stuck in
a conveyer belt the factory.

115
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,466
Are you done yet?

116
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,067
Why'd you even mention
the foreman, then?

117
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,103
What was your name?
Yamazaki, isn't it?

118
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,107
We're going to use your body
as a vessel to draw

119
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,842
the spirit in and then exorcise it.

120
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,777
Wait a minute, hold on...

121
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,680
How exactly does
this "exorcism" work?

122
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,016
We'll just hit you really hard.

123
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:56,983
Hit me?

124
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,785
But anybody could do that,
how is that...!

125
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,055
Yes!

126
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,490
The spirit went into him.

127
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,624
The spirit went into him!

128
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,728
That looked more like a punch than
a spiritual possession to me.

129
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,097
No, no, I'm the spirit inside him.

130
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:15,035
Well gentlemen, this factory
will be shutting down as of today,

131
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,603
but I will take full responsibility...

132
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,405
Hey!
That's the factory foreman!

133
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,907
Wait, what was the story again?

134
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,642
You idiot!

135
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,878
It's about a woman who died after
getting stuck in a conveyer belt.

136
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:25,945
No!

137
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,548
There's no way someone would
get stuck in a conveyer belt.

138
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,050
It was a woman who...

139
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,885
what was it?

140
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,120
Never mind!
Just act like a normal woman!

141
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,088
Are you kidding!

142
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,956
Playing a normal woman
might sound easy,

143
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,758
but it's the most difficult
thing to play!

144
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,861
Nobody expects that level
of realism on this show!

145
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,363
Shut up, mummy man!

146
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,099
Your outfit is what
totally lacks realism!

147
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,400
Say that again?

148
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,302
I thought I look
mysterious like this.

149
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,405
Hey! Cut it out, you guys!

150
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,474
We’re still on the job!

151
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,043
Hey, are you even listening
to me? Both of you!

152
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,233
We didn't have any malicious intent.
We also didn't have a job.

153
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,168
We just thought exorcism

154
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,737
might be a good way to make
some quick cash

155
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,039
because we've been getting
a lot of tourists recently.

156
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,440
Isn't that right, Gin?

157
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,142
Yeah, that's right.

158
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,077
I've been able to see spirits
since I was little,

159
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,079
and I wanted to use my gift
to help people.

160
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,484
And now I see a super angry old granny
standing right behind you.

161
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,152
Really, an old granny?

162
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,121
She must be the granny
from the candy store.

163
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,357
She must be mad at me because I kept
buying candy with monopoly money.

164
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,326
What should I do.

165
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,661
Don't worry about it.

166
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,730
She said if you let us all down
and give us some water,

167
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,766
she'll rinse her grudge down the drain.

168
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,100
All right.

169
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,168
Good to know.

170
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,070
Then drink this up through your nose.

171
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:00,707
Hey!
What...

172
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,509
What's this nostalgic feeling?!

173
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,378
It's like that time I almost drowned
in the swimming pool as a kid!

174
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:08,915
Listen, Gin.

175
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,184
I feel like my head is going to explode
right now.

176
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,719
Help me, please...!

177
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,586
Hey there!

178
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,423
An innocent girl is saying her head
is going to explode right now!

179
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,024
Are you okay with that?

180
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,626
This show will end if you
let that happen!

181
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,962
And then a brand new show
will start "Shinsengumi...

182
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,998
Wind of Blood Chronicles"!

183
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:25,965
Don't miss it!

184
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,802
Oh, so then they're totally
going to kill us off.

185
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,904
Somebody, help me!

186
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,840
Hey, Hijikata, I think they've had enough.

187
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,410
If we don't cut this out, Okita's gonna
awaken to the joys of sadism.

188
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:38,978
What are you talking about?

189
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,781
He's practically the prince
from the Planet of Sadists.

190
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,650
It's too late to stop him.

191
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,921
I don't feel so good.

192
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,091
Now, normally,
we'd cut you three up...

193
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,760
and stuff you in a body bag,

194
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,962
but we don't have the time
or the energy to waste on

195
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,564
idiots like you right now.

196
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,631
Get lost!

197
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,603
Ah, they're so afraid of ghosts that they
can't raise a finger to us.

198
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,804
Poor babies.

199
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,340
Do they want mommy to stand guard
while you go to the potty?

200
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,175
You dare ridicule a warrior?

201
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,711
Please come to the bathroom
with me, right now!

202
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,313
I can't believe you're asking them!

203
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,715
Well. I've actually had
to go for a while but,

204
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,717
it's just so scary in there.

205
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:19,819
Come on, let's go.

206
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,753
Yes, ma'am!

207
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,423
Hey, are you really okay with that?

208
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,024
Is this how you wanna live your life?

209
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,125
Hey!

210
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,128
Okay, guys...

211
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,498
I'm asking you to keep this
to yourselves, alright?

212
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,932
I'm begging you.

213
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,902
This looks pretty serious,
to be honest.

214
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,670
Are you guys really all right?

215
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,239
It's pretty embarrassing...

216
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,909
<i>To think our squad could come to</i>
<i>shambles like this over some ghost...</i>

217
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,212
If it's something with a material form,
we'd have no trouble dealing

218
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,614
with it with our swords...

219
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,949
but I honestly have no
idea where to even start

220
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,784
against something that
doesn't have a body.

221
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,419
Huh, but wait, what?

222
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:54,988
Do you really believe
in ghosts, dude?

223
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,358
I'm cringing so much!
It hurts!

224
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,325
Help, Mommy!

225
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,728
There's a man who's injured
his head, over here!

226
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,597
I swear I am going to kill you one day.

227
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,533
Don't tell me that you also saw...

228
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,535
the woman in the red kimono.

229
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,770
I couldn't tell for sure.

230
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,673
But I do know that I saw
something strange.

231
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,409
And I don't think it was human.

232
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,113
‐Help me! Daddy! Helpe me!
‐Help me! Daddy! Helpe me!

233
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:25,852
Hurry up and call 911, this person needs
an ambulance because he's really ill!

234
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,954
Did you guys rehearse
this or something?

235
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,589
A woman in a red kimono...

236
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,126
It reminds me of a ghost
story that I once heard.

237
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,828
At the school that
I used to go to...

238
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,398
this ghost story got passed
around a lot...

239
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,167
<i>Let me see if I remember it...</i>

240
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:46,773
<i>One evening, a student was playing at</i>
<i>the school after classes were over.</i>

241
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:51,978
Wait for me here!

242
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,413
Please just wait for me here!

243
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,582
Okay, don't miss your mark!

244
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,185
<i>Nobody was supposed to be in</i>
<i>the school building, but...</i>

245
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,523
So many mosquitoes around today.

246
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,760
<i>Then</i> <i>a</i> <i>woman</i> <i>in</i> <i>a</i>
<i>red</i> <i>kimono</i> <i>appeared.</i>

247
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,597
And so he asked her
what she was doing.

248
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,035
Gorilla, what's wrong in there?

249
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,704
Did you get it caught
in your zipper?

250
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,539
Kagura, what happened?!

251
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,908
I think he got it caught
in his zipper.

252
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,509
Get out of the way!

253
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,787
How did he end up like that?

254
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,259
The woman in the red kimono...

255
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,862
She's coming!
She's coming, she‐she's coming.

256
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,464
She's coming!

257
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,667
Kondo!
Pull yourself together!

258
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,471
Talking in your sleep at
your age is kinda pathetic.

259
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,439
This must be that...

260
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,142
He's probably having nightmares
about a girl he once dumped.

261
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,313
Kondo has never had anybody to dump,
so it can't be about that.

262
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:04,517
So then it must be the girl that you
dumped that came back for revenge.

263
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,121
I've never been with a girl
who had bad personality.

264
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,390
I see.

265
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,158
‐Then what?
‐Heck if I know!

266
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,629
<i>But there's something in this building</i>
<i>that is not ordinary, that's for sure.</i>

267
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,931
Do you think it's a ghost after all?

268
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:20,667
No way, man.

269
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,835
I don't believe in unscientific
things like ghosts...

270
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,972
Though I do believe in tooth fairies.

271
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,277
This is stupid.

272
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,545
It's too much for me.

273
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,080
Let's go back home.

274
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:35,581
Hey, Gin...

275
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,718
Can you tell me
what're you doing?

276
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,119
Have you got a problem with it?

277
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,990
I thought you guys might be frightened
so I was just trying to be thoughtful.

278
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,060
Gin, but your hands are all
sweaty and gross.

279
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,662
But what are you talking about?!

280
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,265
It's the woman in the red kimono!

281
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,969
Now what are you doing, Gin?

282
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,842
Oh, well, I.
I thought I saw a tooth fairy...

283
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:06,345
Say, tough guy, are you
actually afraid of ghosts...?

284
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,613
What, no way!

285
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,116
Hijikata, take a look this guy is...

286
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,824
Hey Hijikata, what are you doing?

287
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,461
Well, I, I thought I saw a
Mayonnaise fairy, okay...

288
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,032
Wait, wait, wait!

289
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,233
Don't get me wrong!

290
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,435
He might be afraid, but not me.

291
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,038
You're the one who's afraid, not me!

292
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,274
I just got an urge to return
to the womb, that's all!

293
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,043
All right then, all right then.

294
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:41,280
You just go chasing tooth fairies or
mayonnaise fairies or whatever you want.

295
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,950
‐Don't stare at me with those pitying eyes!
‐Don't stare at me with those pitying eyes!

296
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,818
What's wrong with you guys?

297
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,721
If you're trying to scare us again,
forget about it.

298
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,790
The same trick doesn't work twice.

299
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,260
Hey, you're taking this too far.

300
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,230
Ahhhh!

301
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,532
Wow, man, they really put a lot of
effort into their pranks.

302
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,334
This is why I hate kids.

303
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,703
‐You aren't fooling us at all.
‐You aren't fooling us at all.

304
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,877
‐G‐Good evening.
‐G‐Good evening.

305
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,324
I saw it!
It really exists!

306
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,626
It really exists!

307
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:27,960
Hey, Gin!

308
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,562
Just forget about them.

309
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:30,930
They're all doomed anyway.

310
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:35,768
Th...

311
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,303
they made it out.

312
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,137
Wait a minute.

313
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,438
The ghost is haunting them!

314
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,773
They're bringing it towards us!

315
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,875
No!

316
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:44,977
Get away from us!

317
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,245
Hey, guys!

318
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,980
Why are you running from us?

319
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,615
Hold on.
Wait a minute!

320
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,951
Don't you feel something
strange behind us?

321
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:53,386
I don't know!

322
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,387
I have no idea!

323
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,089
I'm sure someone is behind us;
I felt a chill.

324
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,024
Shut up.

325
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,625
Why don't you check
behind us then?

326
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,461
Why the hell can't you just
take a look behind us?

327
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,230
Hold on.
Let's do this.

328
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,432
We'll both turn around and
look at the same time.

329
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,834
Just make sure you do it!

330
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:08,801
Don't cheat!

331
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,902
You better look back!

332
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,637
‐Here we go!
‐Here we go!

333
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,909
‐G‐Good evening.
‐G‐Good evening.

334
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:21,848
Theres no hope.

335
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,216
This time they're gone for sure!

336
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,317
That's awesome!

337
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,385
I'll finally be promoted to Vice‐chief now.

338
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,221
If we make it out alive!

339
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,656
Hey, does anybody have a light?

340
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,659
Oh, there's a mosquito
coil right here.

341
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,127
What the hell was that?

342
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,029
How could something
like that even exist?

343
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,665
Shinpachi, do you think
that Gin died?

344
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,500
Do you think that Gin died?

345
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:46,138
A little while back, I was testing out
some black magic to try to

346
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,708
summon an evil spirit
to get rid of Hijikata.

347
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,777
Maybe that thing is from
what I did back then.

348
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,014
Just how dark can your
soul possibly be, man?

349
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,916
Are you the root of all this evil?

350
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,051
You bastard!
I'll avenge Gin!

351
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,920
Hey, hey!
Stop it!

352
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,989
This place is too small for that!

353
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,691
Why do you have to fight every time
you see each other?

354
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,969
We‐We're goners!

355
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,805
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry if I did
something to upset you,

356
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,041
I don't know what
for but I'm sorry!

357
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,509
You guys apologize to it, too!

358
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,711
Apologizing by bowing your
head transcends race,

359
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,414
religion, creed, species and
even dimensions, you idiots.

360
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,450
Seriously! We'll even lick the soles
of your shoes, so please forgive us.

361
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,519
I don't taste very good so
don't try to eat me,

362
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,421
I don't taste very good so
don't try to eat me...

363
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,225
She's she's gone?

364
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,694
Why though?

365
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,238
‐Stop it with the annoying sound effects!
‐Stop it with the annoying sound effects!

366
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,109
Wow, you're still alive?

367
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,513
And you must have
the devil's luck.

368
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,849
Where did the thing go?

369
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,519
I don't know...

370
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,554
Chasing after the others, probably.

371
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,223
It ran away...

372
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,359
You know something...

373
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,930
while I was being chased by it, I was
giving it my most scariest of looks.

374
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,032
I guess it must have worked.

375
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,134
Yeah, right.

376
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,905
It left because I was pinching it the
entire time it was chasing us.

377
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,774
Wow you were pinching it how ama...

378
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,784
Okay. Well...

379
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,288
now that I'm all refreshed after a
quick swim, it's time for a counterattack.

380
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,923
Don't try to act so tough.

381
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,191
Your voice is quivering...

382
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,959
I'll take care of that thing.

383
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,328
You go ahead and lay down, princess.

384
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,732
I think you're the one
who's frightened.

385
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:56,669
And I bet you hid in the pond to hide
the fact you wet your pants!

386
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,238
What was that?
Shall I exorcise you before

387
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,373
I get to the ghost!

388
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,509
Well, you know what?
I do owe you quite a lot...

389
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,913
so I think it's time for me to
pay you back with interest!

390
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,515
Did I lend you something?

391
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,983
Don't worry, you can keep it!

392
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,019
I already bought a
new Game Cube anyways.

393
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,454
‐Shut up, already!
‐Shut up, already!

394
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:51,991
Just as I expected...

395
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:53,993
This man...

396
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,795
and this man, as well as this one...

397
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,131
All of these men, who were
attacked by ghosts,

398
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,434
have huge mosquito bites...

399
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,203
<i>That thing...</i>

400
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,839
<i>is not a ghost at all.</i>

401
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,546
Hey!
How is that fair?

402
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,581
It's flying!

403
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,517
Hey, wh‐wh‐what's wrong?

404
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,152
Are you s‐s‐scared or what?

405
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,788
No way am I scared!

406
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,157
Who do you think I am?

407
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,359
Well said then!

408
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,328
Alright.

409
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:30,696
You can be the bait for it...

410
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,399
Then we'll do the thing...

411
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,301
Hey, wait!

412
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,569
What does "do the thing" mean?

413
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,170
Escape?
So what?

414
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,039
Are you trying to use me
as bait to dip?

415
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,941
No way, man.

416
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,110
Um, I'm going to shoot it
with a bazooka.

417
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,245
Yeah, and where's
the bazooka then?

418
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,048
Everyone has a bazooka
hidden deep within their heart.

419
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,884
I'm not letting you run off
on your own, idiot.

420
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,586
Hey, let go!

421
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,520
What are you doing?

422
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,969
Running from an enemy goes
against the warrior code.

423
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,972
You had better study the ways
of the samurai from scratch.

424
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,841
What the hell...

425
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,079
is your problem, you jackass?

426
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:27,953
You're a hundred years too young to
tell me about the way of the samurai.

427
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,457
What?

428
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,429
Uhh, I'm really sorry for everything
that I did to you guys.

429
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,367
I'm an Amanto that's in a form like
what you call "mosquitos" on earth...

430
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,537
I got pregnant with my
boss at work not very long ago...

431
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:48,140
And I needed energy for the
delivery, that's all...

432
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:52,811
He's married and has a family, so I
decided to become a single mom.

433
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,881
So I was looking for blood
and found the perfect place

434
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,484
full of hot‐blooded men, so...

435
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,820
I'm really sorry about that.

436
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,356
I just wanted to be strong
for my baby.

437
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,560
I wanted to be strong enough
to raise my baby by myself!

438
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,431
I'm sorry, but can you at least stop
making that horrible face?

439
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,235
It doesn't matter whether it's
a ghost or a mosquito.

440
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:18,604
They're both a pain in
the butt to everyone.

441
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,339
You're the one that's
a pain in the butt!

442
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,908
I told you I'm not giving you
a reward for this.

443
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,043
Get lost.

444
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:24,910
Hold on.

445
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,013
Did you forget that it was my final blow
that solved everything.

446
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,915
What are you talking about?

447
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:33,786
I made the final blow long before
you did anything at all.

448
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,890
I was doing fine on my own whether
you were there or not.

449
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,759
Yeah, you sure talk big for
someone who wet their pants.

450
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,662
Who would believe the formidable
"demon" is scared of ghosts?

451
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,364
It's totally ridiculous!

452
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,067
Even the man upstairs
would be surprised about it.

453
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,836
Hey, I was not scared at all.

454
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,174
I was just startled, and there's a huge
difference between the two, you know.

455
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,010
You were obviously petrified though.

456
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,413
Hey, listen, up, I was just going
along with the script.

457
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,215
I actually like ghosts in stuff.

458
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,384
We should do this every week.

459
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,853
Hey, Gin, it's time for us to go!

460
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,759
What are you two doing
down there, huh?

461
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,096
‐I'm just looking for my shoes.
‐I'm just looking for my shoes.

462
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,757
<i>It's hot! It’s hot, it’s hot!</i>

463
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:55,094
<i>Why do I have to get drenched</i>
<i>in sweat just to buy a fan?</i>

464
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,196
<i>I'm here to get something</i>
<i>to cool down,</i>

465
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,897
<i>but I'm just getting hotter!</i>

466
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,499
<i>The next episode...</i>

467
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,946
I finally have enough mayonnaise!
