1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,270
<i>In the previous episode.</i>

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,173
<i>Shinpachi saved a cat‐eared girl</i>
<i>from a drunk man on the train.</i>

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,942
<i>And so, this and that happened.</i>

4
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,311
<i>and he's been invited</i>
<i>to the girl's house</i>

5
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,647
<i>which is an incredibly</i>
<i>suspicious‐looking place.</i>

6
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:14,648
<i>And...</i>

7
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:15,649
<i>that pretty much sums it up!</i>

8
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,851
<i>What exactly is</i>
<i>"this and that happened"?</i>

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,319
<i>Could you explain in more detail?</i>

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,922
<i>Don't forget to mention why we're</i>
<i>following Shinpachi.</i>

11
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,357
<i>And so...</i>

12
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,992
<i>it just kinda happened, probably.</i>

13
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,895
<i>I've</i> <i>never</i> <i>heard</i> <i>such</i>
<i>an</i> <i>irresponsible</i> <i>recap.</i>

14
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,197
<i>And</i> <i>so,</i> <i>I</i> <i>can't</i> <i>really</i>
<i>be</i> <i>bothered</i> <i>anymore.</i>

15
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,932
<i>Nobody</i> <i>cares</i> <i>how</i>
<i>you're</i> <i>feeling!</i>

16
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:33,500
<i>Big Sis.</i>

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,603
<i>It's impossible for a lazy bum like</i>
<i>him to remember the details.</i>

18
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,704
<i>I'll do it...</i>

19
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,540
<i>And so, the cake was delicious.</i>

20
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,407
<i>‐And so...</i>
<i>‐And so...</i>

21
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,842
<i>‐you're just talking about yourself.</i>
<i>‐you're just talking about yourself.</i>

22
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:42,843
<i>You two think you can get away</i>

23
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:45,913
<i>with it if you just tack "and so"</i>
<i>onto anything, don't you?</i>

24
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,549
<i>And</i> <i>so,</i> <i>the</i> <i>cake</i> <i>was</i>
<i>definitely</i> <i>delicious.</i>

25
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:49,983
<i>Fine.</i>
<i>I get it.</i>

26
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:50,951
<i>I'll do it...</i>

27
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:52,986
<i>The land of the samurai...</i>

28
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,821
<i>There was a time,</i>
<i>a long time ago...</i>

29
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,390
<i>when our country was called</i>
<i>by that name.</i>

30
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,624
<i>Hey, that's too far back!!</i>

31
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,326
<i>How many episodes</i>
<i>are we going to recap?</i>

32
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,262
<i>And so, I'm explaining</i>
<i>things in order.</i>

33
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,197
<i>And so, you just keep quiet then.</i>

34
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,766
<i>And so, I will not!</i>

35
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,234
<i>You keep quiet then.</i>

36
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,337
<i>And so, let's just get to</i>
<i>the opening song already.</i>

37
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,485
So,
what is this?

38
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,422
Your wife has said that she didn't
want a molester for a husband.

39
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,425
She said that you're probably
too scared to commit harakiri,

40
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,294
so you should really just blow
your head off with this, yeah?

41
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,997
That woman doesn't
understand anything at all.

42
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,232
I'm such a complete
and total coward

43
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,134
that I jump at the
slightest noise.

44
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,271
I certainly don't have the guts
to molest anyone.

45
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,440
That's pathetic, Pops.

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,042
You should die with honor as
becomes a true Samurai...

47
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,745
rather than shamelessly
living in disgrace.

48
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,247
You're the type to jump
of a cliff yourself

49
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,049
whenever something bad
happens aren't you?

50
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,652
Life is not about living
with honor, no.

51
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,654
It's about enduring everything
from embarrassment

52
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,656
to eating dirt to whatever
else goes on.

53
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,127
Why did you shoot him?

54
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,328
I'm so sorry.

55
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,064
I couldn't bear to see Pops
like that anymore, Hijikata.

56
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,834
Hijikata...

57
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:15,769
why are...

58
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,437
people always so...

59
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:20,807
Why did you shoot him?

60
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,276
Why did you edit the scene
to make it look as if I did it?

61
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,411
And why are you sweating?

62
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:25,812
That's really pissing me off!

63
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:29,082
Everyone, come here!
Hijikata has gone mad.

64
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,550
Hijikata has gone crazy!

65
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,618
I don't know what to do anymore!

66
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,453
‐I just don't know!
‐No, no! Shut up!

67
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,122
‐Oh I think he's going to kill me!
‐It's not like that! It wasn't me!

68
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,189
‐Everyone, come!
‐Cut that out!

69
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:36,957
‐He's going to kill me!
‐Okay?

70
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:37,891
Oh, come os, now!

71
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,827
I can't find my police ID since
the day of that incident.

72
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,730
Ever since the
so‐called molestation,

73
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,600
my police ID and my wallet
completely disappeared.

74
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,538
<i>And so, this and that happened,</i>
<i>and now we're following Shinpachi.</i>

75
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,305
<i>Good enough?</i>

76
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,341
<i>I</i> <i>mean</i> <i>the</i> <i>episodes</i>
<i>already</i> <i>started,</i>

77
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,643
and so, the recap doesn't
really matter anymore.

78
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,811
Yeah.
And so.

79
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:58,645
Hey!

80
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,313
What do you mean it doesn't
matter anymore?

81
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,915
You're the one who
told me to re‐do it!

82
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,550
And I did my very best!

83
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,658
Hey, Erowitch?

84
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,660
I wonder where she went?

85
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:16,963
What's that?

86
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,131
What's this card?

87
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,668
So, what's this card?

88
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:22,736
Hey stop that!

89
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,237
It's not funny, you two!

90
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,240
The girl set me up on the train and
made me look like a molester!

91
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:31,545
I was drinking at a bar alone,
when the girl approached me.

92
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,747
<i>She was a good listener man,</i>

93
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,916
<i>and even listened to my problem</i>
<i>with my daughter.</i>

94
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,684
<i>Oh, well, that doesn't matter,</i>

95
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,753
<i>anyway, I talked with</i>
<i>her for a while...</i>

96
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,256
<i>We got along really well, and she</i>
<i>told me that she knew a good place,</i>

97
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,125
<i>so I followed her and</i>
<i>when we got on the train,</i>

98
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:45,859
<i>she started making a fuss.</i>

99
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:46,560
Stop!

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,095
Help me, somebody!

101
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:51,865
Somebody, help me!

102
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,068
<i>When I woke up, I find myself</i>
<i>labeled a molester,</i>

103
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,237
<i>my police ID and wallet</i>
<i>had disappeared,</i>

104
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,905
<i>and all I had left</i>
<i>was this card.</i>

105
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,109
<i>I've taken both your heart</i>
<i>and your wallet.</i>

106
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,145
<i>Phantom Thief "Cat Ears"</i>
<i>XOXO</i>

107
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,947
<i>I really fell for it.</i>

108
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,281
<i>And at my age, too.</i>

109
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,549
<i>But let me say this.</i>

110
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,951
<i>She didn't steal my heart.</i>

111
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,920
<i>Oh no! My heart had</i>
<i>already been stolen</i>

112
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,922
<i>by my wife thirty years ago.</i>

113
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,064
Wait up!
You bastard!

114
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,734
I told you...

115
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,269
to wait!

116
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,942
Who are you, huh?

117
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,245
Are you one of that
boy's family members?

118
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,113
Oh, his older brother?

119
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,615
What are you doing here?

120
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,984
So tell me, why did you
follow us?

121
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,486
Because you were worried
about him?

122
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,854
You really didn't need to worry.

123
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,556
I haven't done anything
at all to him.

124
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,092
Your little brother's virginity
is completely safe.

125
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,193
Because...

126
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,162
the only thing that
I want is love.

127
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,030
I am the Phantom
Thief "Cat Ears".

128
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,768
I steal love because love is
the most beautiful thing.

129
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,837
But you cannot see love, can you?

130
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,938
And therefore...

131
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:07,007
I borrow their wallet from them...

132
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,043
as a proof that I have stolen
someone's love away.

133
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,379
You BORROWED
Shinpachi's wallet?

134
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,948
What nonsense are you
talking about?

135
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,751
You're just a petty thief
as far as I can tell.

136
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,587
Your little brother was amazing,
you know...

137
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,590
I'm surprised that such an innocent
boy exists these days.

138
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,425
<i>He completely fell for it.</i>

139
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,728
<i>He even wore those cat ears</i>
<i>I gave to him as a joke.</i>

140
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,197
<i>It was hilarious...</i>

141
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:34,968
It made my heart beat like I was
in love for the first time again.

142
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,437
This is why I can't
stop doing this.

143
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,538
Hey, hey!

144
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,507
Where'd your fake
cat girl act go?

145
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,776
I mean, I kind of liked it a little,
you know.

146
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,178
Men are really stupid,
aren't they?

147
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,748
They can only care about what
they see on the outside.

148
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:49,850
Oh!

149
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,619
I just said my true feelings
out loud.

150
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,920
Silly meow!

151
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,056
Enough with that stupid
silly meow!

152
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,125
Because you smell like
disgusting cat litter!

153
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,594
And you are cat litter!

154
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,533
Women who can say
"silly meow!"

155
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,835
with a straight face
are good for nothing.

156
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,370
Silly meow!

157
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:11,838
Wow...

158
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,039
she's right...

159
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,104
Shinpachi!

160
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,373
Everyone, stop this already!

161
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,509
They say...

162
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,511
that all is fair in love and war,
don't they?

163
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,013
Let's stop all this.

164
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,683
Listen, I don't despise you for
what you did to me Erowitch.

165
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,619
In fact, I'm kind of grateful
for what you did.

166
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,288
It was short, but...

167
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,123
It felt like.

168
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,293
I had an actual girlfriend,
at least for a little while.

169
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:08,461
So then...

170
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,563
let me just say one thing.

171
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,368
Just kidding, you asshole!

172
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,607
What a bad ass!

173
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:39,693
<i>Tragic or not...</i>

174
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,428
<i>love apparently helps</i>
<i>you grow up.</i>

175
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,630
<i>I've become stronger</i>
<i>since then.</i>

176
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,637
<i>I've learned a lot about</i>
<i>my heart.</i>

177
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,173
<i>It is no longer swayed</i>
<i>by little things.</i>

178
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,709
<i>I can stay strongwilled</i>
<i>in the face of beauty.</i>

179
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,410
<i>People's attractiveness,</i>

180
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,512
<i>doesn't come from</i>
<i>superficial things.</i>

181
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,514
<i>Things like being cute,</i>
<i>or having cat ears.</i>

182
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,116
<i>Rather, it comes...</i>

183
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,151
<i>from deep within their hearts.</i>

184
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,089
Hey!
You guys, shut up!

185
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:09,823
Be quiet!

186
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,658
You're bothering the
other passengers!

187
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,660
But Captain, look!

188
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,261
Take a look at this!

189
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,996
It's Otsu's new single!

190
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,867
She's gone for the cat‐eared
look on the album jacket!

191
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,105
<i>What a CAT‐astrophe!</i>

192
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,499
<i>Hey, Pops, is it true that</i>
<i>he's on the move?</i>

193
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,734
<i>You picked us up when</i>
<i>we had nowhere to go...</i>

194
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,770
<i>so we're prepared to</i>
<i>do anything for you!</i>

195
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,004
<i>The next episode</i>...

196
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,308
<i>Right after the opening song!</i>

197
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,575
<i>I called you all here</i>
<i>for one reason.</i>

198
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,977
The guy finally decided
to make a move.

199
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,147
Hey, Pops, are you really
sure about that?

200
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:58,251
There's no mistake, our spies
always have an eye on that guy.

201
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,121
He seems to have been aware
of that and laid low for a while,

202
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,991
but his patience has reached its
limit and he's made a move.

203
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,427
<i>I don't plan to be playing</i>
<i>reactive anymore.</i>

204
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,396
If our superiors have
complaints about it,

205
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,198
<i>I'm prepared to</i>
<i>commit harakiri.</i>

206
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,835
This is a battle to the death.

207
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,271
I'm going to crush the guy
and all of his evil plans.

208
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:20,406
All right.

209
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,976
If you're that committed
to this to this action...

210
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,611
then so are we, Pops.

211
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:27,914
I'm counting on you.

212
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,420
Hijikata...

213
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,421
Okita...

214
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,757
There's just one thing I want
to check with you two.

215
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,258
What is it?

216
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,761
Exactly who is this "guy"?

217
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,996
You mean you don't know?!

218
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,973
Oh, Kuriko.

219
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,543
Sorry, sorry, I'm late, I know.

220
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,045
Did you wait long for me?

221
00:12:59,045 --> 00:12:59,746
No.

222
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,914
I just got here, too,
same as you did.

223
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,350
I actually didn't have to wait
long at all, honey.

224
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,486
Oh, great.
That's good.

225
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,122
It's just that the train was delayed,
you know how that goes...

226
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,724
That bastard, who is he kidding?

227
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:15,762
Kuriko's been here for over
an hour waiting for you to arrive.

228
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,831
That's one hour of my
daughter's precious time.

229
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,568
You're going to pay for that
attitude with your remaining life.

230
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,003
Hey, Hijikata!

231
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,371
Get over here, I need a mount!

232
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,440
Just hold on!
This is the guy we're after?

233
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,908
Your daughter's boyfriend?

234
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,576
Shut up!
He's not her boyfriend!

235
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,012
I would never approve
such a shallow bastard!

236
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,180
Just shut up, Pops!

237
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,050
I don't acknowledge you as
a police chief either huh!

238
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,317
Hijikata, now that you mention it,

239
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,385
I'll never acknowledge you

240
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,621
as vice‐chief of the
Shinsengumi either!!

241
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,956
You shut up, Okita!
This is ridiculous!

242
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,391
I took off work to come here.

243
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,727
And you just want us to interrupt
your daughter's date?

244
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,262
I can't do this.

245
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,097
I'm going to be leaving now!

246
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,365
Hey, wait there!

247
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,367
I never asked you to
break up her date.

248
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,469
No, what I want...

249
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,571
I want to assassinate that guy.

250
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,139
That's even worse!

251
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,275
Do you really think
a pimp like that

252
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,243
is going to be able to make
my daughter happy?

253
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,246
Of course, I want Kuriko to be able
to make her own decisions

254
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,548
and love who she loves.

255
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:09,816
So I thought about it,

256
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,018
and I came to the conclusion
that I have no choice,

257
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:12,719
but to kill him.

258
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,587
I think you're overthinking
this whole thing!!

259
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,524
Hey Kondo, talk some sense into this
doting daddy here, will you?

260
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,293
My name's no longer Kondo.

261
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,828
My name is now...

262
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,096
Gorillo O Seven.

263
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,465
What are you doing exactly?

264
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,168
What's the O seven for too?

265
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,536
It's my unlucky number.

266
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,539
This year, I've been dumped
by Otae seven times...

267
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,975
Hey, look Pops, I'll help, too.

268
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,377
I can't stand guys
who cover themselves

269
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,446
in jewelry to hide
their insecurities.

270
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:41,948
Thanks for that Kondo...

271
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,850
I've known Kuriko since
she was a little girl,

272
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,951
she's like a sister to me.

273
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,619
I can't give her away to that loser!

274
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,221
Let's do it, Pops!!

275
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:49,789
‐Okay!
‐H‐Hey stop!!

276
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,525
This is very bad, they might
actually kill him.

277
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,727
Okita, we've got to stop them...

278
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,129
The name is Okito...

279
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,132
My name is now Okito O Seven.

280
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:00,967
Hey!!

281
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,002
This looks like fun, so see ya!

282
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,711
And so I told him that I was...

283
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,997
What a clever bastard.

284
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,565
He picked his spot well!

285
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,200
I can't get a clear shot...

286
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,668
and I'm feeling kind of sick...

287
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,803
Hey, Kondo,

288
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,405
how far do we have to ride
until we catch up with him?

289
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,440
We're not getting any closer,
you know.

290
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,943
Oh, for god's sake, you're on
a merry‐go‐round!!

291
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,977
You're just going to keep going

292
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,014
around and around and
around, you morons!

293
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,350
I've never been to an amusement
park, so I had no idea.

294
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,287
Although I've been to plenty
of adult amusement parks...

295
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,422
Don't be reckless, Pops.

296
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,891
You just want to break
the two of them up, right?

297
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,027
There are tons of
other ways to do that.

298
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,695
What was that?

299
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,063
You wanna join us now?

300
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,465
You wanna join the
assassin alliance?

301
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,969
I just came to make sure you
lot don't do anything stupid!

302
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,738
Unlike you guys, I'm not about
to judge that guy

303
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,775
just by his looks and make
assumptions about his character.

304
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,045
He looks like a bad guy
no matter how you look at him.

305
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,379
He's full of holes.

306
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,748
Aren't people born with
enough holes already?

307
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,817
Why go through the trouble
of making more?

308
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,053
Body‐piercing isn't
a capital offense.

309
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,255
Girls of that age are all like that...

310
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,458
always attracted to the bad boys,
the dangerous type...

311
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,162
Then they get burned and
grow up just a little bit.

312
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,898
Since when did you become
an expert, Okita?

313
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,200
Hey, I know I look
super dangerous,

314
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,169
but I've never been popular
with the girls.

315
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,670
What are you going
to do about it?

316
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,472
Well I guess it means,
for better or for worse,

317
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,474
both love and romance
are nothing but illusions.

318
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,045
It seems like your daughter's
created a false image

319
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,347
of that guy in her head.

320
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,383
But if she sees his true colors,
I'm sure she'll wake up.

321
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,886
Luckily, this is the perfect
place for that.

322
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:04,991
My sweet Shichibee,

323
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,926
I want to ride that
one next, honey.

324
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,061
Hey, hey, are you serious?

325
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,863
I can't go on rides like that.

326
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,432
Why not, are you afraid, honey?

327
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,536
I'm not afraid, but they make
me feel sick, you know.

328
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,771
So you're actually afraid,
then, honey!

329
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,072
No, I'm not!

330
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,908
Just go and ride it by yourself.

331
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,809
No, I don't want
to go by myself.

332
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,045
I want to go on a ride
with you, honey!

333
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,447
Wow...

334
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,050
Well, I'll be watching you
from here.

335
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,718
Quit blubbering and
get on the damn ride,

336
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,120
you snot ringed bastard!

337
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,658
Make a fuss, and I'll give
you a new piercing.

338
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,227
My sweet Shichibee?

339
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:41,961
Well...

340
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:42,762
Umm...

341
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,864
So I guess I will ride with you,
after all.

342
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,899
Really, are you serious, honey?

343
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,510
Hey, are you really sure
this plan will work or what?

344
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,178
Absolutely!

345
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,414
Okita's a sadist, and he's
good at torturing

346
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,349
people by pressuring
them into a corner.

347
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,318
Now crap!

348
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,054
Crap your pants!

349
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,757
If she doesn't smell poop by the time
this ride is over, I'll kill you.

350
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,627
My sweet Shichibee?

351
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,196
Tell me, what is the matter, honey?

352
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,698
You don't look well.

353
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,334
Let's get off the ride, if you
don't like it, honey.

354
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,935
I'll kill you if you get off!

355
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,570
I'm riding, so shut up!

356
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,238
I told you I'm going to ride it!

357
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,007
Shichibee...
Whoa!

358
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,512
This is tougher than
I'd expected.

359
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:35,581
How's it going over there?

360
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,016
Aaaah!

361
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,384
What?!

362
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,952
What are you doing
back there?

363
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,654
I forgot to fasten my seat belt.

364
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,389
I forgot to fasten my seat belt!

365
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,392
Hey, what's wrong with him?

366
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,760
He's acting completely different.

367
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,095
He's getting all panicky.

368
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,098
I'm a sadist, I'm not used to being
on the receiving end.

369
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,899
I'm a glass cannon.

370
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,801
H‐H‐H‐Help me, Hijikata!

371
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,169
Damn you!
Help me!

372
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,371
You idiot!

373
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,679
Ah I was so scared, but it was fun!

374
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,148
Are you all right over there,
my sweet Shichibee?

375
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:09,982
Oh.

376
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,251
My sweet, Shichibee.

377
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,552
How come...

378
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,888
you're sitting high in your seat?

379
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,558
This is bad.

380
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,293
You'll probably be disgusted...

381
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:22,561
But, um I...

382
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,430
I kind of...

383
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,065
crapped my pants.

384
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,647
Sorry about all that.

385
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,583
I don't have anything against
you or anything.

386
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,018
Thank goodness!

387
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,221
Actually, I, did too, honey.

388
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:53,759
I feel less embarrassed knowing
I'm not the only one, honey.

389
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,363
Really?
That's amazing!

390
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,398
We've got matching craps!
It's a miracle!

391
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,033
Yeah, we really are connected

392
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,002
by something that
we can't see, honey.

393
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,637
What?
Like we're...

394
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,039
connected by our intestines
or something?

395
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,709
Oh, wow!
You're so silly, honey!

396
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,210
Hey, what the hell
is wrong with you?

397
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,112
They've gotten
even closer now!

398
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,014
What the hell is wrong
with your daughter?

399
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,882
What kind of girl
craps in her pants?

400
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,551
Did you not potty train her?

401
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,153
Oh no.

402
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,488
They're moving to
their next ride!

403
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:23,189
What?!

404
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,690
With crap in their pants?

405
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,225
Hey, Kondo.
Hurry up!

406
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,127
Kondo...

407
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,897
Why's he sitting so high
in his seat?

408
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,132
Don't tell...

409
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:35,701
anybody about this, honey.

410
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,475
I can't believe this.

411
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,610
How could she still want
to be with him after that?

412
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,645
My daughter is
totally unbelievable.

413
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,681
She really is unbelievable.

414
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,750
I'll kill you if you tell anyone
about this, Hijikata.

415
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,853
Hey Pops, don't you worry.

416
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,722
Come on, your daughter hasn't
really crapped her pants.

417
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:57,590
Look.

418
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,891
That guy changed his pants,

419
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,327
but your daughter is wearing
the same clothes.

420
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,063
Is she walking around with a
crap between her butt cheeks?

421
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,297
Of course not, Pops!

422
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,333
Don't you know your own
daughter better than that?

423
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,801
Don't you realise?

424
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:12,037
Your daughter lied about crapping
so that guy wouldn't feel bad.

425
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:12,905
What did you just say?

426
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,807
Hijikata, are you saying that...

427
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,676
Kuriko isn't disgusted at all
by him crapping his pants?

428
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,913
You guys were disgusted
when I crapped my pants,

429
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,249
but Kuriko accepts the guy
for who he really is,

430
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,750
including all the filth.

431
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,352
Is that what you're saying?

432
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,554
Hey, Kondo, I'm disgusted
with you, too.

433
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:29,889
Yeah.

434
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,792
It looks like she really loves
that guy, doesn't she?

435
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,361
Hey, Pops, look at that there!

436
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:37,663
This doesn't look good.

437
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,365
They're headed to
the Ferris wheel.

438
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,599
There's no mistake.

439
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,901
They're planning on kissing.

440
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:42,902
Really?

441
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,237
Riding on the Ferris wheel
means they're going to kiss.

442
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,872
That thing was created
for kissing.

443
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:47,840
K‐Kiss?

444
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,241
Really?
Oh my god!

445
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,242
I never knew that!

446
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,744
Kuriko is in danger!

447
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,445
‐Let's go!!
‐Okay!

448
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:00,786
<i>Mr. Hijikata.</i>

449
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,321
<i>Mr. Hijikata...</i>

450
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,924
<i>Mr.</i> <i>Hijikata,</i> <i>you're</i> <i>so</i>
<i>handsome</i> <i>and</i> <i>cool.</i>

451
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,625
<i>You must be so popular.</i>

452
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,093
<i>Not really.</i>

453
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,328
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

454
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,696
<i>You're being modest...</i>

455
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,599
<i>Mr. Hijikata, Mr. Hijikata.</i>

456
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,734
<i>What are you eating?</i>

457
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:21,106
<i>It's a bowl of rice,</i>
<i>Hijikata Special.</i>

458
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,007
<i>You want some?</i>

459
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:32,251
I thought there was no
such thing as true love.

460
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:41,060
<i>My gosh, Kuriko,</i>
<i>you really are amazing.</i>

461
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:42,962
Most people would be
totally disgusted

462
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,864
if their boyfriend crapped
his pants.

463
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,465
I thought it was all over for us.

464
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,102
Of course not,
my sweet Shichibee,

465
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,071
I would never hate you
for that, honey...

466
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,774
After all, you weren't disgusted
when I crapped in my pants,

467
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:56,609
were you, honey.

468
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:57,309
What?

469
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,944
That's because, well I...

470
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,180
Because you?

471
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,881
Because you what, honey...?

472
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,350
Well, uh...

473
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,218
That's, that's because I...

474
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,188
lo...

475
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:10,256
Lo?

476
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,257
Lo...

477
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:12,992
‐Lo...?
‐Lo...

478
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,764
Wh‐What the hell is that?

479
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,433
Assassin Samurai O seven...

480
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,869
‐And we are taking your life!
‐And we are taking your life!

481
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,038
What in the world are they doing...

482
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,740
Somebody, help...

483
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,210
What's that?!

484
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,378
‐Noooo!
‐Nooo!

485
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,014
Hijikata?

486
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,382
Hijikata?

487
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,983
Who is that person?

488
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,487
I'm the warrior of love,
Mayo O seven!

489
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,556
Those who dare stand in
the way of love...

490
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,592
begone!

491
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,535
Mayo O Seven?

492
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,237
He's so cool!

493
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,308
Don't ever let anyone
come between you two.

494
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,644
Farewell.

495
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,880
Hey, Wait up!

496
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,682
I'll dump this poopy pants.

497
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:13,419
So would you go out with me,
Mayo O Seven, please?

498
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,321
Whoa!

499
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,427
<i>What is love?</i>

500
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,806
<i>Next episode...</i>

501
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:38,510
<i>Dream...</i>

502
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,646
<i>Catcher!</i>
