1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,603
<i>The princess of Norsteinberg,</i>

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:03,904
<i>a small country</i>
<i>in Europe,</i>

3
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>Francesca finds herself bored</i>
<i>during her travels abroad.</i>

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,877
<i>She manages to slip past</i>
<i>her butler's watchful eyes,</i>

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,712
<i>and escapes into town alone.</i>

6
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,915
<i>There she meets a small‐time</i>
<i>thief named Don Pierre.</i>

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,185
<i>At first, Francesca was constantly</i>
<i>at odds with this playboy</i>

8
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,519
<i>but then she accidentally discovers</i>

9
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,688
<i>that he is in fact</i>
<i>her long lost brother.</i>

10
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:24,024
<i>Now, the militia group</i>
<i>"Black Rose Squad"</i>

11
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,692
<i>is coming after them</i>
<i>to kill them!</i>

12
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,661
<i>Can Francesca adjust</i>
<i>herself to society</i>

13
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,363
<i>after being a slacker</i>
<i>for so long?</i>

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,299
<i>And what will become of</i>
<i>Marco and Diego's forbidden love?</i>

15
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,134
<i>All of this is completely wrong!</i>

16
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,169
<i>This has got nothing to do</i>
<i>with this show at all!</i>

17
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,373
<i>Anime is such</i>
<i>a wonderful thing, isn't it?</i>

18
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,440
<i>Hey!</i>

19
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,503
<i>The stage where</i>
<i>we actors have amassed</i>

20
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:20,707
<i>is home to brilliant lights,</i>
<i>and the shadows cast.</i>

21
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:24,611
<i>And as there are songs,</i>
<i>for the flowers which bloom.</i>

22
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,814
<i>There too are songs for</i>
<i>those stuck in their tomb.</i>

23
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,753
<i>Here, two lonely souls,</i>
<i>both under the weather.</i>

24
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:38,125
<i>Follow the flow of the river,</i>
<i>like birds of a feather.</i>

25
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,696
<i>And to hide their tears</i>
<i>in the bottom of a glass.</i>

26
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,999
<i>Approaching a bar,</i>
<i>they exchange a quick glance.</i>

27
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,569
<i>From the glow of the door</i>
<i>escapes the hum of a tone.</i>

28
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:52,806
<i>A song which warms the heart</i>
<i>for reasons unknown.</i>

29
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,355
<i>Stop, you bastard!</i>

30
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,858
Man, I'm so drunk.

31
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,263
Watch your step on your way
back there, Mr. Mu.

32
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:19,099
You've had quite
a lot to drink.

33
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,937
Nah, it's nothing,
you can't even call that drinking.

34
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,273
I'll come again soon!

35
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,509
After all, you're the only one
who'll listen to my stories, Otose!

36
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,144
What are you talking about?

37
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,547
Penniless customers
are not really welcome!

38
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,749
Yeah, I know.

39
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:44,858
<i>Meow!</i>

40
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,161
Oh, it's only a stray cat.

41
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,564
Are you hungry, little cat?

42
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,599
Come on in.

43
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,835
If the bar's leftovers
are okay with you,

44
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,303
then I'll let you have
some to eat.

45
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:06,613
What's that?

46
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,915
Can't you say anything
other than "wait on the rent"

47
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,717
with that stupid mouth of yours?

48
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,752
I'm so sick and tired
of hearing that.

49
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,588
At least once in a while
you should try saying something like,

50
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,490
"advance payment,"
or "thank you so much,"

51
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,291
or "you're looking
beautiful as usual."

52
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,626
You're such a witless brat!

53
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,062
If all I have to do is say it,
I'll say it all you want.

54
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,065
"You're looking...
beautiful as usual."

55
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,368
I can't do it. My mouth
is saying "No, no, no!"

56
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,303
Such an useless mouth
you've got.

57
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,671
You should just sew it shut!

58
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,775
Shall I do it for you with a kite
string and a big fat needle, hm?

59
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:35,675
What do you say?

60
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,810
Oh, shut up!

61
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,545
My mouth exists
for the sole purpose

62
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,348
of drinking strawberry milk
and eating chocolate parfaits.

63
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,550
If you have the money
to get baby stuff like that,

64
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,685
then cough up some
of the rent you owe me!

65
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,487
Even a cent would be
an improvement!

66
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:51,024
I'm telling you that my life
is more important than the rent.

67
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,959
You are a complete idiot!

68
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,396
An idiot with brainless on top!

69
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,032
And I'll add moronic to it
while I'm at it.

70
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,034
You moronic brainless idiot!

71
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,202
Oh yeah?

72
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:05,338
Well everyone knows it takes one
to know one, you shitty idiot!

73
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,940
Idiot, idiot, idiot!

74
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,608
It's not only your taste buds.

75
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,044
Do your brain cells
belong to a baby, too?

76
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,349
Please, ma'am,
may I have some more?

77
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,052
‐Stop drinking your food!
‐This ain't no lunch counter, little girl!

78
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,086
‐For a while now,
‐Look, this is a place

79
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,087
‐you haven't been eating your rice,
‐that serves drinks

80
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,189
‐you've been drinking it!
‐and healthy eroticism!

81
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,724
‐A meal isn't a competitive sport?!
‐A "Hostess Bar", if you catch my drift!

82
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,994
If you cook it with charcoal inside,
the chlorine smells goes away.

83
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,996
It's a pearl of wisdom
from my grandma.

84
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,699
Are you trying to suck up
to me with that advice?

85
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,502
You're indirectly complaining
about it tasting bad, huh?

86
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:39,339
Normally, people eating sound like
"nom nom" or "munch munch"

87
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,774
but in your case...

88
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,243
No, you dummy!

89
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,744
The most expensive thing
in this bar

90
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,280
isn't the phony smile of
the hostesses who work here!

91
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,182
It's those nuts
you're holding!

92
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,621
I'll make sure to add it
separately to your rent.

93
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,158
No... no, no way, man...

94
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,261
For idiots like you who can't even
wipe your own backsides,

95
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,697
the idea of helping
other people is ludicrous.

96
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,033
I was born with a stiff body
so I can't see it all.

97
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,003
I never really mind
if there's a little bit unwiped.

98
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,504
Go study some metaphor.

99
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,541
Eating these nuts
makes me thirsty.

100
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,243
‐Oolong tea!
‐Sure thing.

101
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,178
Hey! Why drink oolong tea here

102
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,646
for a lot of money
when you can get it

103
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,682
at the supermarket in a plastic
bottle for a couple bucks!

104
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,051
That's as insane as some
rich guy who burns a wad of bills

105
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,387
like a torch in the foyer
looking for his shoes!

106
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,256
Do something about her,
Gintoki!

107
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,724
At this rate, all the money
in the world

108
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,759
isn't going to be enough
to pay her debt!

109
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,395
Not that we had
any money to begin with.

110
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,431
‐Yeah, sure.
‐We could work honest jobs!

111
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,267
Uh‐huh.

112
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,402
Or we could seriously
just dine and dash!

113
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:43,803
Yeah.

114
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,373
I'm desperate enough
to do anything!

115
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,275
I'll kill you and take
my own life, too!

116
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,076
Just calm down.

117
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,414
For crying out loud!

118
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,915
Just how lazy are you?

119
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,385
You can't even make up your mind
to run away from a problem,

120
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,920
much less have the guts
to stand up to something!

121
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,590
This must be a product of
poor education and bad parenting!

122
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,624
Aw, shut up, man!

123
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,826
Once you've grown up,
it isn't your parents' fault anymore.

124
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,628
Do something about it yourself.

125
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,398
You haven't done anything
about the rent!

126
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,200
Pipe down, kid.

127
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,307
Even if your parents die,
you still have to eat and rest.

128
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,376
‐You're kidding.
‐There's blood! Blood!

129
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,512
I'm bleeding!

130
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,547
Hey there.
Are you all right?

131
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,785
Please press on
the wound with this.

132
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,688
What's this?
I haven't seen your face before.

133
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,222
‐So, are you new here?
‐Yes.

134
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,223
My name is Catherine,

135
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:40,260
and I just started working
at the hostess bar the other day.

136
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,730
Catherine has migrated to earth
to make some money.

137
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,433
She works hard to send
money back to her family.

138
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,868
I am very pleased
to meet you.

139
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,504
She's very good
with the customers,

140
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,173
and does a good job
at the bar.

141
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,009
Thank you so much,
but I am no match for you.

142
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,845
How impressive.

143
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,247
And she clearly even has
a great sense of humor.

144
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,249
Really?
You think so?

145
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,884
Unlike a certain someone

146
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,454
who doesn't have a funny bone
in his entire body.

147
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,857
Or the other one, who lives
only to satisfy her hunger.

148
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,360
No, thank you.

149
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,495
I can't eat another bite.

150
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,197
‐Of course not.
‐Of course not.

151
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,999
Well, I'm sure
there will be difficult times,

152
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,901
tough times and
unbearable times, kiddo.

153
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,737
But hang in there.

154
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,472
Thank you so much, mister.

155
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,006
You might think
things are hard now,

156
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,476
but in the future, it's gonna get
a whole lot worse.

157
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,711
And if you keep that in mind,
you'll learn to endure it.

158
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,013
What are you,
the king of the masochists?

159
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,556
Come back here soon!

160
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,992
<i>Alright, have a good night.</i>

161
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,161
Oh, that rotten bureaucrat!

162
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,973
<i>The money is gone!</i>

163
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,544
All the money...

164
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,350
No, where's the money?
It was right here!

165
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,059
<i>The money is gone!</i>

166
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,749
I am starving.

167
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,517
I am dying.

168
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,119
Shut up, man.

169
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,588
Why don't you just
go home if you're hungry?

170
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,024
You can probably find
some food there anyways.

171
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,960
Because my sister
is at home cooking today.

172
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,628
Huh?

173
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:59,365
I said my sister is at home,
and she's cooking up something.

174
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,942
Look Shin, today
we're having fried egg

175
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,312
with some fried egg
and a side of more fried egg.

176
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,350
Eating my sister's fried eggs
makes me hallucinate

177
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,385
and see things
I shouldn't imagine.

178
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,023
Hey, Gin, did you know?

179
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,926
There's a kind of fermented
herring called SurstrÃ¶mming

180
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,630
that smells so bad that even
cats run away for their lives.

181
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,866
But they say really
smelly things taste good.

182
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,603
Hey Gin, did you know?

183
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,438
After hunting down a reindeer,

184
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,673
the inuit people will eat
all of its parts,

185
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:44,444
all of it, all the way down to
the gunky insides of its stomach,

186
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,512
they waste nothing.

187
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:50,517
It must be so steamy and
so soft and so delicious.

188
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,254
Hey Gin, did you know?

189
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,823
When an owl catches
a baby mouse,

190
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,926
it brings the baby mouse back
to its nest and feeds it

191
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,828
to fatten it up
before eating it,

192
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,197
because it's gotta be
plump and juicy!

193
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:09,669
This world is filled with so many
wonderful and delicious things!

194
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,307
You know, now that I think about it,

195
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,976
the rent for this place
isn't really all that low, is it?

196
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,945
There's gotta be
a ton of other places

197
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,513
that are cheaper
than this place, right?

198
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,148
Don't you think, Gin?

199
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,318
What the...?

200
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:26,819
Oh no!

201
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,755
Our emergency funds!

202
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:33,359
That pre‐diabetic bastard!

203
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,728
<i>You see?</i>
<i>So that's why.</i>

204
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,531
<i>I thought I got into a</i>
<i>really great company</i>

205
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,833
back then anyway.

206
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,604
Where're my cigarettes?

207
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:45,705
Silly man.

208
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,041
You just sent Catherine out
to buy some, remember?

209
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,310
Did I really?
I don't remember.

210
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,277
Yes, you did.

211
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,545
You are too much.

212
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,084
She sure is taking
her time, though.

213
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,253
Where could that little girl
have run off to?

214
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,029
<i>Hey.</i>

215
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,498
<i>Running an errand?</i>

216
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,234
Oh, man, that old hag
is a real slave driver.

217
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,637
Y... yes, I am.

218
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,739
I'm buying cigarettes
for a customer.

219
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,574
I see, yeah.

220
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,644
I am sorry, very, very sorry.

221
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,881
Well... anyway, this place here is...

222
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,152
it's pretty much like a garbage dump
piling up and rotting with trash.

223
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,789
What I'm trying to say is,
we're the same, you and I.

224
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,458
The two of us,
we're both trash.

225
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,728
No wait, trash isn't
the right word for us.

226
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,864
We're boogers in the same...
in the same nostril.

227
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:45,965
In the same pot...

228
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,734
not, pan... spoon.

229
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,102
I understand.

230
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,169
You're a good person.

231
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,804
All of you are good people.

232
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,812
Are you two from
around these parts?

233
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,147
What's it to you?

234
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,384
I'm part of an investigation.

235
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:06,886
So?

236
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,622
I'd like to ask the two of you
a few questions.

237
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,860
Is this... everyone?

238
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,662
So did something happen?

239
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,830
Yeah, you could say that.

240
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:21,968
Recently there's been a series
of robberies all targeting shops

241
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,103
and businesses in this vicinity.

242
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,306
We've counted sixteen
since the start of this month.

243
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,610
That's a pretty troubling situation.

244
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,212
Says the thief who stole
the money himself!

245
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,981
And what the heck
is that sweet looking breath?

246
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,282
You obviously ate!

247
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,986
We believe the perp is an Amanto,
but it's still under investigation.

248
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,055
Have you heard any rumors
that might give us a lead?

249
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,657
Well officer, I have something.

250
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,592
This girl here is the criminal!

251
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,331
Hey you!

252
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,767
What in the hell
did you do that for?

253
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,904
Men who make bad jokes
are to have their fingers broken.

254
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,272
Oh really?

255
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,075
I was just trying to do you a favor
by getting you a free ticket

256
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,676
back to your homeland,
that's all.

257
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,180
Actually, the thing is,
deportation isn't free at all.

258
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,481
No, thank you.

259
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,517
I'd rather die than return home
in disgrace as a criminal.

260
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,419
Beggars can't be choosers!

261
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,353
If worse comes to worst,

262
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,489
I'll just hitch a ride
on the side of the ship.

263
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:23,629
<i>‐Five, four, three, two, one, zero!</i>
‐Oh no!

264
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,935
<i>I made it alive coming here!</i>

265
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,070
I'm sure it'll work out!

266
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,840
That was just dumb luck,
I'm telling you!

267
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,241
It'll be fine.

268
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,642
Even if she's thrown out
into space,

269
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,144
she'll have no problem surviving.

270
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,679
I'm not a cockroach!

271
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,381
How dare you insult
cockroaches like that?

272
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,149
Watch what you say!

273
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,485
Apologize to the cockroaches now!

274
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,487
They're the greatest survivors
known on Earth!

275
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,621
‐Never!
‐Apologize right now!

276
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,557
‐Is this a bad time?
‐Let's just put it this way.

277
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,892
We don't have money
to be stolen

278
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,294
and we don't have anyone
bad enough to steal.

279
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,864
Well, if anything happens,
we'll let you know.

280
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,132
Please do, ma'am.

281
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,299
<i>Yeah, whatever.</i>

282
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,844
The inside of my mouth
is so disgusting!

283
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:15,248
Drinking sweet milk just before
bed was a bad idea after all.

284
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,551
Alright, I've taken another step up
towards adulthood.

285
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,821
But wait! I'm literally
going down steps.

286
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,891
Look at me doing stand‐up comedy
out here by myself.

287
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,127
Huh? What are you...?

288
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,395
Are you still working?

289
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,031
Oh, well I guess not.

290
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,900
Huh?

291
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,701
I am so hungry.

292
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:40,540
I'm s‐s‐s‐sooooo sorry!

293
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,042
I didn't mean to interrupt your romantic
sensual midnight rendezvous!

294
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:43,943
I'll make myself disappear.

295
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,712
Please indulge yourselves in the carnal
pleasure to your hearts content!

296
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,780
Hey.

297
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,449
You ignorant peasants.

298
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,486
Bow down before
my almighty power!

299
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,023
You're sleepwalking?

300
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,724
What kind of dream is that?

301
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,760
A mob with a Cuban cigar
and cognac?

302
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,030
Human life is but an instant
in the grand scheme of....

303
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,031
‐Hey!
‐What are you?

304
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:08,434
‐Mimicking a movie villain?
‐What?

305
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,171
Hey that... that looks a lot
like my motor scooter.

306
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,907
You are all good people,
you know.

307
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,509
Now that you mention it,

308
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,812
the umbrella she has in the back
looks exactly like mine.

309
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,415
‐That's the bar's cash register!
‐It's almost 3 a .m.

310
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,583
What's going on?

311
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,467
What's this, Catherine?

312
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,736
See ya, you rotten old hag.

313
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,305
Morons!

314
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,543
‐That ugly pig faced cow, I'll kill her!
‐I swear, there will be blood, I swear it!

315
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,350
What the...?

316
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,320
‐Help! Help, Chad!
‐Give me a break, come on!

317
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,158
Wait! What are you guys doing?

318
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,860
Where are you going?

319
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,264
Wait for me!

320
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,500
They are gone.

321
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,636
They took my taxi!

322
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:17,970
Oh, Chad,
I'm so scared!

323
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,071
Shut the hell up, lady!

324
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,172
Don't yell at me!

325
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,553
Whoa! What was that?

326
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:39,759
Not the cat!

327
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,734
Hey you guys, at this rate we're gonna
have more felony charges

328
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,503
on our record
than Catherine!

329
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,638
There!
Catherine!

330
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:56,142
Prepare to die!

331
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,744
<i>Catherine!</i>

332
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,923
Now Die!

333
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,008
<i>‐What?</i>
<i>‐What?</i>

334
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,387
Such a pity.

335
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,857
To think that I was just
starting to really like you.

336
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,928
That story about you supporting
your family back home.

337
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,629
Was that a lie, too?

338
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,199
Ms. Otose, you are
a good person.

339
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,867
But you're way too naive.

340
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,405
You wanna help people?
Fine.

341
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:03,409
But if you overdo it, then bad guys like
me will take advantage of you.

342
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,478
It's part of my character.

343
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,013
Too late to change it.

344
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:15,921
But, thanks to that, I've managed
to meet some interesting guys.

345
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,891
You want to hear about it?

346
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,327
No, just hear me out.

347
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,928
It's the least you can do.

348
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,768
One day there was
a man, you see...

349
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,241
<i>It was cold</i>
<i>and snowing that day.</i>

350
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:40,880
<i>On a whim, I decided to go out</i>
<i>and visit my late husband's grave.</i>

351
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,326
<i>Hey, Granny!</i>

352
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,862
Can I eat those dumplings?

353
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,998
I'm so hungry I could die.

354
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,034
These dumplings aren't for me.

355
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,569
I gave them to my husband.

356
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,937
You'll have to ask him.

357
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:06,639
Oh yeah?

358
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,773
Okay, then.

359
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,980
<i>So you're wondering,</i>
<i>what did my husband say?</i>

360
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,617
<i>When I asked him that,</i>
<i>do you know what he said?</i>

361
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,088
<i>Don't know.</i>

362
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,024
I'm not interested in
your sentimental reminiscing.

363
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,227
He made a one way
promise to him.

364
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,228
That's what he did.

365
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,166
<i>"I won't forget this debt.</i>

366
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,771
<i>Your old lady, she's probably</i>
<i>going to kick the bucket soon,</i>

367
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,907
<i>but until that happens...</i>

368
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:46,278
<i>I promise that I will watch</i>
<i>over her for you."</i>

369
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,604
You're going to watch
over me, huh?

370
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,310
Well let's see what you
can do then, young man.

371
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,450
What a way to show thanks
for being given an honest job.

372
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,886
People who have no
moral code are just terrible,

373
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,053
don't you think, old hag?

374
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,958
Like a certain someone
who's squatting

375
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,794
in the second floor of someone's
house without paying rent?

376
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,598
I guess this world
is just full of terrible people.

377
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,535
You know what?
You're always talking nonsense.

378
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,703
Thanks for your help
with our investigation.

379
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,874
Some stray cat
you turned out to be.

380
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,014
But cats, they are creatures
that claw at things by nature.

381
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,051
You hit the nail
right on the head.

382
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,586
It's too late for you
to change now.

383
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,454
But if you're ever
out and hungry,

384
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,923
come back to the shop.

385
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,792
I'll let you have some
of the bar's leftovers.

386
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:12,131
Ms Otose, you're so naive.

387
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,167
But...

388
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:21,140
I've never seen you not get angry
when someone calls you a fool.

389
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,309
Well, I have my moments
now and then.

390
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,612
And while I'm at it, why don't I let you
have this month's rent for free.

391
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:27,379
What do you say?

392
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,448
Are you serious?!
Thank you, granny!

393
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,383
I'll be sure to pay
the month after next!

394
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,520
<i>Heck, I'm writing off your rent</i>
<i>for all these months.</i>

395
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,021
<i>You won't pay next month!</i>

396
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,623
<i>Yippee! Yippee!</i>

397
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,058
<i>Stop playing the innocent.</i>

398
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,729
<i>Kindness is ephemeral,</i>
<i>impossible to clutch</i>

399
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:47,066
<i>but is definitely obtainable</i>
<i>and warm to the touch.</i>

400
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,035
<i>Thawing the ice on</i>
<i>your frosty fingertips</i>

401
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:54,406
<i>is a song which warms the heart</i>
<i>for reasons as such.</i>

402
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:55,875
<i>The end.</i>

403
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,137
<i>We seem to have gotten</i>
<i>ourselves into a tight spot</i>

404
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,206
<i>while</i> <i>looking</i> <i>for</i> <i>a</i>
<i>ham</i> <i>for</i> <i>our</i> <i>client.</i>

405
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,909
<i>What? The greatest pirates in</i>
<i>the universe, "Harusame"?</i>

406
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,400
<i>Hey! Who do you think</i>
<i>you are, Frieza, you jerk!</i>

407
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,570
<i>The next episode...</i>

408
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,553
Wow, I'm such a cute little kitty cat too, huh?
