1
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:03,270
So then cherish her...

2
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:04,938
Remember that always.

3
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:36,630
<i>I see...</i>

4
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,634
So that little glutton really
went back home to her planet.

5
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:41,401
Yeah...

6
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,070
I tried to stop her, but...

7
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,506
Gin said it's probably best
for her to be with her father.

8
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,275
Yeah, that's right.

9
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,311
It's much better than staying with
a drifting wanderer like Gin.

10
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,916
She was always noisy and
very annoying, but I think...

11
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,018
I'm gonna miss her
now that she's gone.

12
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,759
You all look so sad, don't you?

13
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,996
You're all so sad because
you miss me so much, huh?

14
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,465
<i>I'm just going to hide</i>
<i>out for a while.</i>

15
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,667
<i>That way, you'll keep</i>
<i>believing that I'm gone</i>

16
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,970
<i>and you'll truly realize just</i>
<i>how important I was to you!</i>

17
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,074
Anyway, I don't see the guy who
deserves to be feeling the saddest...

18
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:22,376
Where is he?

19
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,710
Where is that mop top...

20
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,145
Oh...

21
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,251
<i>In the restroom...</i>

22
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:32,619
<i>I see now...</i>

23
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,023
<i>Gin must have gone in there so no</i>
<i>one can see him crying over me.</i>

24
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,991
Ah!

25
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,093
Gee, it's all swollen!

26
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,697
<i>Swollen eyes from crying</i>
<i>too hard?</i>

27
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,298
This is terrible...

28
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,668
My important parts
are evidently swollen!

29
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,469
Seriously, this is awful!

30
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,246
Really?

31
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,915
It's probably because you've been
touching it with your filthy hands!

32
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,283
I'm nothing like you.

33
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,152
How old do you think I am?

34
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,221
So then, did you get a disease
from someone?

35
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,623
I'm not like you, either.

36
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,792
I don't skate on thin ice
the way you do.

37
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,193
<i>That bastard!</i>

38
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,129
<i>I'm gone but all you can talk</i>
<i>about is your stupid crotch?</i>

39
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,065
Maybe you're just imagining it?

40
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,200
Maybe it was just that size
to begin with.

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,802
<i>Get back to the original topic!</i>

42
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,236
No way, man.

43
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,338
He was more of a
modest kind of guy.

44
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,907
<i>Hey, that's enough of that!</i>

45
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,310
Do you remember if you peed
on a worm somewhere, huh?

46
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,245
They say it swells up if you do.

47
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,281
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,982
That's just an old wives' tale.

49
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,086
Come on.

50
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,187
Did you really...

51
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,154
No, no, no.

52
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,191
It wasn't a worm, it was
more like a worm‐like alien...

53
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,593
So you went and pissed
on an alien, then?

54
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,329
Alright, rest in peace, buddy.

55
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,166
My friend did that one time and
he became a shooting star.

56
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:53,900
What's that?

57
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,268
He became a shooting star?

58
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,303
What does that mean?

59
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,304
What's going to
happen to me?

60
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,005
Rather, what's going
to happen...

61
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,240
to the other me!

62
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,509
<i>I</i> <i>said</i> <i>that's</i> <i>enough</i> <i>about</i>
<i>that</i> <i>subject</i> <i>already!</i>

63
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,978
All they're talking about
is his crotch.

64
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,346
Come on!

65
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,048
Do they always talk about
their crotches

66
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,250
whenever I'm not around
or what?

67
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:11,885
Huh?

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,354
Good evening everyone!

69
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,455
<i>Big sis!</i>

70
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,091
Hey, Sis, what's with
the Chinese dress?

71
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,161
Well, it happens to be
Chinese Dress Booster Month

72
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:24,564
at the bar I work at, so everyone's
wearing these dresses to work.

73
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,534
What is a Chinese Dress
Booster Month, huh?

74
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,469
What's being boosted by that?

75
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,438
Well, Men's fantasies, Shin...

76
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,240
How do I look, Gin?

77
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,441
This is not good.

78
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,710
I don't wanna be a shooting star,
I'm still too young.

79
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,980
It's useless to try to speak to him
right now, and don't ask why.

80
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,682
Oh, you miss Kagura so much...

81
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,152
I'm so sorry, did I make you
remember her?

82
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,988
<i>Yes, Sister!</i>
<i>We're back on track.</i>

83
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,322
<i>You're the best, big sis!</i>

84
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:50,757
<i>I think this might</i>
<i>cheer you up...</i>

85
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,361
<i>Have some drinks and</i>
<i>forget about her!</i>

86
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,762
<i>‐Oh? Big sis?</i>
<i>‐Wow, this is expensive sake!</i>

87
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,064
<i>‐That's not, that's not right...</i>
<i>‐I swiped...</i>

88
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,499
<i>‐Forget about me?</i>
<i>‐er got it from work.</i>

89
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,268
<i>‐Are you guys trying to forget?</i>
‐Forgetful Wife...

90
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,237
Some things you just have
to forget to be able

91
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,405
to move on in life.

92
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,608
Let's rinse away the bad memories
with a glass of this, huh?

93
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,576
Right, Gin?

94
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,278
<i>Bad memories?</i>
<i>Am I a bad memory?</i>

95
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,812
No, I can't forget about it.

96
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,515
It's always hanging in
between my legs, isn't it.

97
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,518
<i>Can't you think of anything</i>
<i>other than your crotch, man?</i>

98
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,188
Well, I'm sure Kagura's doing
just fine back home.

99
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,356
As long as she's alive,
we'll be able to see her again.

100
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,058
<i>No</i> <i>one's</i> <i>listening</i>
<i>to</i> <i>you,</i> <i>granny!</i>

101
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,128
If you ask me, I'm very happy
that she's gone...

102
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,429
<i>What did you say, pig shit?!</i>

103
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,630
I've always thought
she and I were

104
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,833
too similar for the both of us
to be in the same show...

105
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,600
<i>As if!</i>

106
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:37,504
I'm like the cute oriental chick
from a foreign planet.

107
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,806
Nah.
You're not cute at all...

108
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,640
Meow!

109
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,921
I really miss her, to tell the truth...

110
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,458
I was starting to think of Kagura
as something like my real sister...

111
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:00,827
Because...

112
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,696
I've actually always wanted
a little sister.

113
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:03,997
Big sis...

114
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,932
When Shinpachi was little,

115
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,068
I used to force
him to dress up like a girl.

116
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,403
Our dad always scolded
me for doing that...

117
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,005
Right, Shinpachi?

118
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,041
<i>Your father's Bleep‐bleep,</i>

119
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,011
<i>Your father's bleep‐bleep,</i>

120
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,513
<i>‐Listen to her!</i>
<i>‐Your father's bleep‐bleep!</i>

121
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:21,848
‐Oh why...
<i>‐Father's Bleep‐bleep,</i>

122
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,284
Why did you have to die
and leave us alone, Dad!

123
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,920
<i>You're</i> <i>just</i> <i>crying</i> <i>about</i>
<i>your</i> <i>father</i> <i>now?</i>

124
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:30,357
Personally speaking, do you know
any good urologists around here?

125
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,492
<i>Yeah that's personally</i>
<i>speaking all‐right.</i>

126
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,428
Actually, there's a urologist
across from the grocery store...

127
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,798
on third Street, and I heard there's
a hot doctor working there.

128
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,599
Really, man?

129
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,067
That'll make my swelling
even worse.

130
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,802
<i>Get lost, you dirty old men!</i>

131
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,237
Well, maybe so.

132
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,740
But if I had to see a doctor,
I'd prefer it if they're hot.

133
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,442
But I guess you'd feel
a little embarrassed...

134
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:50,744
You idiot!

135
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,312
That's what's good about it, man.

136
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,147
Can you imagine
being examined

137
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,982
by a hot doc in that
kind of situation?

138
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,417
That's something
to look forward to!

139
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,652
I guess so, but listen,

140
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,589
if you have a stone, it'll be a
completely different story.

141
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,057
Stones are really nasty.

142
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,392
I mean, it really hurts.

143
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,493
The pain is out of this world.

144
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,928
It won't matter whether the doc is
beautiful or butt ugly.

145
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,096
Is that so?

146
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,565
But I heard you feel great
once it's finally out...

147
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:13,933
Well that's true.

148
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,070
It's a sign that your suffering
is finally over with...

149
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,307
I can't even describe
how painful it is.

150
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,143
It hurts so bad you can do a
somersault and win the Olympics!

151
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:24,477
So you actually experienced it?

152
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,679
Well I...

153
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,914
<i>What the hell are you</i>
<i>guys talking about now?</i>

154
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,417
Besides, a barbaric glutton
in a Chinese dress

155
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,485
in this day and age
is so last century!

156
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,020
I bet she was
faking everything!

157
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,356
She was probably sticking a finger
up her throat behind the scenes.

158
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,725
Hey, you're forgetting
your accent aren't you?

159
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,494
<i>You were faking your</i>
<i>accent all along?!</i>

160
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,697
Hey, Catherine,
you're way out of line!

161
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,299
That's no way to speak about
a dead person you know!

162
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,702
Have some respect at least,
would you please?

163
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,170
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>I'm not dead!</i>

164
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,940
Besides, if you ask me,
your accent is totally outdated!

165
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,809
I can't understand
what you're saying!

166
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:56,710
Tell her, Shin!

167
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,179
<i>Your father's Bleep‐bleep,</i>

168
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,414
<i>Your father's Bleep‐bleep,</i>

169
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:02,916
<i>I told you to listen!</i>

170
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,084
I wonder what it's
gonna be like

171
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,985
to have a hot chick doctor
check this out.

172
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,387
Should I go, or should I not?

173
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:08,955
<i>Please go, straight to hell!</i>

174
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,390
Anyway, what about Odd Jobs?

175
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,059
What are you two planning
to do with just two dudes?

176
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,029
Do you even think you can
keep it running without her?

177
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:16,930
Huh?

178
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,199
It doesn't matter how many people
there are at Odd Jobs.

179
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,068
I used to run it all by myself
in the first place.

180
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,803
No no, that's not what I meant...

181
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,305
Actually...

182
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,742
A while back this girl came by
saying she wanted to join you...

183
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,711
I guess she must have thought
I was the boss of Odd Jobs,

184
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,480
and left her picture and her resume.

185
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,048
Huh?
She what?

186
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,384
I mean was the Odd Jobs
ever that famous?

187
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,853
I feel a little "ticklish" hearing that...

188
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,389
Your mean your crotch
feels ticklish, right?

189
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,995
This picture looks more like...

190
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,930
a mailorder bride ad to me.

191
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,866
Oh, wow, she's very pretty!

192
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,501
Oh, I can't see...

193
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,069
Ayame Sarutobi...

194
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,971
She's has an impressive career.

195
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,739
She served the Spy Agent
for a good while

196
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,307
and then transitioned
into an assassin.

197
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,375
An assassin?

198
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,710
Whoa!

199
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:05,879
A thief!

200
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,813
And a spy girl!

201
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,314
Just Who the hell are you?

202
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,184
Like the fading echo
of a Temple bell...

203
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,052
all things in life are temporary...

204
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,488
Like the flower that
blossoms and wilts...

205
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,358
thus marks the change of heroine.

206
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,927
Good evening,
Odd Jobs Sacchan is here.

207
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,543
Good evening,
Odd Jobs Sacchan is here.

208
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,144
Huh?

209
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:38,978
Sacchan?

210
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:41,948
Life isn't that easy.

211
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,084
The thing is, you can't
succeed in business

212
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,585
with just a bunch of dull guys...

213
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,187
Like Adam and Eve,

214
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,255
the CEO and his
beautiful secretary,

215
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,958
a master and his maid,
and Lady and the Trumpet...

216
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:56,162
In every circumstance, you need
to have a real heroine.

217
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,532
<i>I think she's missing the point</i>
<i>in some of these instances...</i>

218
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,569
That being said, violent little girls
are so last epoch...

219
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,805
and a cat‐eared middle‐aged
bonesack is totally out!

220
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:09,042
As for granny, I can't even tell if she's
a dude, or human...

221
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,277
Do you understand?

222
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,712
Things are gonna be different...

223
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,449
Starting today is the age of the ninja
girl four‐eyes!

224
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,284
Wait, Four‐eyes ninja girl?

225
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,652
Right, let's go with that.

226
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,321
It's time for three eyes ninja...

227
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,089
Oops, my mistake!

228
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,357
<i>She's such a mess.</i>

229
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,025
And thusly, to conclude...

230
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:26,926
um...

231
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,595
Gin, please take me...

232
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,830
as your bride, no, I mean...

233
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,565
Let me join the Odd Jobs team...

234
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,701
We've already got a four‐eyes
named Shinpachi, so no...

235
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,272
This is a team and we all need
our own distinct personality...

236
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,275
And your appearance expresses
your personality the most.

237
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,176
You don't want fans to say,

238
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,245
"Hey, she's just copying
Shinpachi's look,"

239
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,779
so maybe you can change
your hairstyle...

240
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,948
like to a Mohawk, or try to look
more like Choda

241
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,917
or Chewcocka or
R2‐D2F or something.

242
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:51,918
You have to have a stand out

243
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,821
look so that people can tell who
you are just from your silhouette,

244
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,523
and then you can come back
for another round.

245
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,958
<i>He's trying to talk</i>
<i>like he's an editor</i>

246
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,560
<i>from some</i>
<i>comic book publisher.</i>

247
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,330
You've got nothing to complain
about now, do you?

248
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,665
Are you happy now?

249
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,268
You can bully me all you want,
but just so you know...

250
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,070
I'm a masochist,
so I'm enjoying it too!

251
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,707
I'm a masochist and you're
a sadist, and that's enough.

252
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,109
What else do we need?

253
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,345
Uh, sorry, but I am kind of
an masochist too...

254
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,715
<i>That's the DORK</i>
<i>that you're talking to!!</i>

255
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,219
Hey, listen newcomer!

256
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,989
You pop up out of nowhere and
think you can be a heroine?!

257
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,225
This world ain't so easygoing!

258
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,126
<i>Catherine, you...</i>

259
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,461
I don't know who you think you are,

260
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,064
but I've been working here
or an eternity,

261
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,066
way before you
ever showed up.

262
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,935
I'm the new heroine
of this show!

263
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,670
That's definitely not how it works!

264
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,904
Shut up, you middle‐aged woman!

265
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,739
Those cat ears are completely
wasted on you!

266
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:47,941
If I had your ears,

267
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,809
I'd be a ninja with
glasses and cat ears.

268
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,345
I'd have all three elements
of the triforce of cuteness!

269
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,914
A middle aged woman
with cat ears.

270
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,816
This gap is what draws
in the fans!

271
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,051
<i>Oh yeah, what fans?</i>

272
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,886
That's enough,
knock it off now, you two!

273
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,688
How do you think Kagura
would feel if she saw

274
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,289
you two fighting
like this right now?

275
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,158
And besides...

276
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,759
don't you think
this Chinese dress

277
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,761
looks much better on me
than on Kagura?

278
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:09,729
<i>Big sis?</i>

279
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,298
<i>Are you also trying to become</i>
<i>the new heroine of the show?</i>

280
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,736
Why are you acting like
you're suddenly so special,

281
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,937
meow bow wow!

282
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,807
You have the least personality
of all of us, meow bow wow!

283
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,342
<i>What's with the</i>
<i>"meow bow wow"?</i>

284
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,110
<i>Is that her new gimmick?</i>

285
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,812
<i>Is</i> <i>she</i> <i>trying</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i>
<i>a</i> <i>dog</i> <i>or</i> <i>a</i> <i>cat?</i>

286
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,547
Just being unique
doesn't make you a heroine.

287
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,382
Your face is too unique,
in an ugly way!

288
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,850
‐What?!
‐And as for you,

289
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,218
don't act so high and mighty,

290
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,987
just because you've known
Gin longer than me,

291
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:34,954
four‐eyes beam!

292
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,956
<i>She doesn't even have</i>
<i>her glasses anymore.</i>

293
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,791
But I've known him
the longest, Kung Fu!!

294
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,027
<i>What does Kung fu have</i>
<i>to do with anything?</i>

295
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,861
What's that?!

296
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,330
Listen, it's not about
how much time you spend.

297
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,165
It's all about the quality
of that time,

298
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,734
and the truth is
I've already done

299
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,002
a whole lot of this
and that with Gin!

300
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:49,702
Oh?

301
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,205
And what exactly is "a whole
lot of this and that"?

302
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,041
I bet they're all fragments
of your sick delusions.

303
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,643
You should go see
a mental doctor.

304
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,012
Cat woman's stronger than
ninja girls, meow bow wow!

305
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,346
A cat woman who's dog ugly!

306
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,115
What are you, kindergarteners?

307
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,416
Just back off, you two!

308
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,251
You don't love Gin
as much as I do,

309
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,120
and I'm the one who deserves
to be with him.

310
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,554
I do like him.

311
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,323
He ranks right next
to my nail clippers.

312
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,258
How far down the list is that,
meow bow wow?!

313
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,293
What I really love
most is myself.

314
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,730
So the thing is I hate losing
to anyone, and that's that.

315
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,098
Let me tell you something.

316
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,167
I don't give a shit
about that useless Gin!

317
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,036
I just want to be
on the show longer!

318
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,003
Meow bow wow!

319
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,005
Get lost, or take my
four‐eyes cannon!

320
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,574
Hey, everyone, just relax,
just calm down!

321
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,745
If you keep this up,
we won't be able to decide.

322
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,014
You should listen to the opinions
of us men.

323
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,649
<i>What are you trying to decide?</i>

324
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,951
Us men firmly believe...

325
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,588
that a girl has to be three requirements
to become a heroine...

326
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,592
The three are...

327
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,927
Good Looks.

328
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:48,961
Good figure.

329
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,129
Personality.

330
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,699
I don't have any of those!

331
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,380
I don't have any of those!

332
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,850
So that being said, you can
go home now, cat ears.

333
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:11,984
Screw you.

334
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,486
But you two can stay.

335
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,887
Listen...

336
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,322
A heroine needs to look...

337
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:17,490
very good...

338
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,926
But it doesn't mean
just having a pretty face,

339
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,260
no, not at all...

340
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,029
because a face
that beats the crap

341
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,464
out of people with a smile...

342
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,799
And someone who gets
excited over things

343
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,234
that might cause a
kids relationship

344
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,369
with their parents to get awkward
are out of the question...

345
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:31,504
What I'm saying...

346
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,439
It's all about your
facial expressions!

347
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,675
<i>You have to make</i>
<i>expressions the fans</i>

348
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,810
<i>expect according</i>
<i>to each circumstance...</i>

349
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,412
<i>Smile when you should smile...</i>

350
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,347
<i>Getting angry from</i>
<i>time to time.</i>

351
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,616
I'm so angry now,
fume fume...

352
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,650
<i>Can blossom flowers</i>

353
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,219
<i>in your background</i>
<i>anytime you want.</i>

354
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,688
It's one day late,
but Happy Birthday!

355
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,857
<i>Being</i> <i>able</i> <i>to</i> <i>tear</i>
<i>up</i> <i>instantly.</i>

356
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,191
Oh, oh, uh...

357
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,094
<i>You have to be able to</i>
<i>cry whenever necessary.</i>

358
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,498
I'm so happy, I'm just
so overwhelmed by it ...

359
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,600
And therefore,
the heroine will be Otsu...

360
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,768
Enough of that!

361
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,035
You heard him.

362
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,203
So you go first.

363
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,404
Cry now.

364
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,542
Then...

365
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,043
Please use this.

366
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,645
<i>You got it wrong from the start!</i>

367
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,013
She's out of the question.

368
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,048
You try.
Cry now.

369
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,017
Well now, that'sway too easy.

370
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,023
Come on, cry!

371
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,626
I won't stop until I see your tears!

372
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,628
Um...
But, why?

373
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,532
But this kinda feels good...

374
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,367
How you like that?

375
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,669
Hey, Otae!

376
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,738
I didn't tell you to make
someone else cry!

377
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,573
‐I told you to cry.
‐I think I like this.

378
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,542
<i>You really are a dork!</i>

379
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,110
Oh, God.

380
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,279
Seriously, what is wrong with you all?

381
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,547
Hey,

382
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,415
you haven't given me a chance yet...

383
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,585
So how do I look?
Purr‐fect?

384
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,790
What is wrong with you all?

385
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,058
I'll kill you, bastard!

386
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,794
<i>Oh,</i> <i>why</i> <i>don't</i> <i>you</i> <i>just</i>
<i>give</i> <i>up?</i>

387
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,433
We‐well, let's leave your
"looks" for now.

388
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,468
<i>What's more important</i>
<i>is your figure.</i>

389
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,271
<i>A heroine's gotta be, you know,</i>
<i>"Bang! Pow! n Boom!"</i>

390
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,040
<i>Like a juicy ripe fruit,</i>

391
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,242
<i>she must be</i>
<i>plump, but not fat.</i>

392
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,177
<i>From the moment</i>
<i>you see them,</i>

393
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,912
<i>the faces won't matter anymore.</i>

394
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,649
<i>They move up and down,</i>
<i>and side to side.</i>

395
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,352
<i>And your sleazy eyes keep</i>
<i>following those movements.</i>

396
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,454
<i>Those jiggles that a heroine,</i>

397
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,690
<i>a real heroine,</i>
<i>should always possess...</i>

398
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,659
<i>That's what I'm talking about</i>
<i>when I say figure...</i>

399
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,229
<i>An erotic hourglass figure</i>
<i>that's thick in parts</i>

400
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,797
<i>but tight where</i>
<i>it needs to be!</i>

401
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,867
<i>He's just talking to himself</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

402
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,203
<i>So of course, that excludes</i>
<i>the monster cat lady...</i>

403
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,139
<i>Now let's compare</i>
<i>the two of you...</i>

404
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,175
<i>Bang.</i>

405
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:49,876
<i>Pow...</i>

406
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,612
Boooooom!

407
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,484
Well then, you both pass...

408
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,819
The last thing is...

409
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,387
Um?
Huh?

410
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,688
Was it "personality"?

411
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:03,589
Well, uh...

412
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,591
Both of you are totally
perfect, so...

413
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,393
I just can't pick a winner...

414
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,728
you know...

415
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,264
You had better
pick one, asshole!

416
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,666
You chumps are the ones
who started this,

417
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,034
four‐eyes bazooka.

418
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,303
Shi‐Shinpachi...

419
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,372
Wake up, Shinpachi.

420
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,474
You're the one who
suggested "personality,"

421
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,842
so you should be the judge of this.

422
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,212
A heroine?

423
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,014
The heroine is...

424
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,182
It's Otsu then.

425
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,951
I would say it's Otsu.

426
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,223
<i>‐I'm the heroine!!!!</i>
<i>‐I'm the heroine!!!!</i>

427
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,199
Come with me to the riverbank.

428
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,567
We'll settle this ourselves!

429
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,369
You asked for it!

430
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,773
‐Gi‐Gin, man...
‐What now?

431
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,411
Why can't we just ever have
nice ordinary girls around us?

432
00:17:58,778 --> 00:17:59,879
I agree.

433
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,214
When it comes right down to it,

434
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,717
Kagura was the best of
them all, wasn't she?

435
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:07,587
I agree...

436
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,189
You guys are so pathetic.

437
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,658
You're the one that
told her to leave,

438
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:13,926
and you already miss her?

439
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,069
This is how selfish men are and why I
don't like them.

440
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,070
Right?

441
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,438
Why don't you say something?

442
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,376
Sorry I don't have
an hourglass figure.

443
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,114
All right, don't say anything.

444
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,349
Don't say a word.

445
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,652
Everyone knows that I'm the only
one who can handle you jerks...

446
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,721
So that means I'm the heroine.

447
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,762
<i>Don't you mean a mascot?</i>

448
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,598
<i>Come inside already!</i>

449
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,233
<i>Let's have another drink.</i>

450
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,072
What's this,
you're not going to eat?

451
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,207
Don't worry about the money.

452
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,942
It's on me today,
I assure you.

453
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,977
Don't you guys
dare eat one bite!

454
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,113
His face tells me
he's plotting something.

455
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,749
And it says he's going to ask us
to do something impossible.

456
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,817
No need for groundless suspicions.

457
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,886
Even if we really
were really hungry,

458
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,354
you can't buy us
off with food.

459
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,522
We're not that cheap...

460
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,557
Don't think you can sweet
talk us either, Katsura...

461
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,226
It's so sweet I can't talk!

462
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,393
This chocolate just
melts in my mouth!

463
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,295
Excuse me!
Can I have a refill?

464
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,832
<i>I should've been</i>
<i>more careful...</i>

465
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,501
<i>Elizabeth was always</i>
<i>with me.</i>

466
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,703
<i>So I should've known</i>
<i>she would attract</i>

467
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,204
<i>the attention of the authorities.</i>

468
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,240
<i>So, who do you think did it?</i>

469
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,643
<i>Chintaro Toyama,</i>
<i>the evil magistrate.</i>

470
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,812
<i>He's a corrupt judge</i>
<i>who takes any bribes</i>

471
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,814
<i>to satisfy his evil desires...</i>

472
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,917
<i>Elizabeth's</i> <i>head</i> <i>will</i> <i>definitely</i>
<i>roll</i> <i>if</i> <i>I</i> <i>don't</i> <i>do</i> <i>something...</i>

473
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,088
I'm begging you, Gintoki.

474
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,991
Please help me to rescue
Elizabeth from that place.

475
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:38,964
What?!

476
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:41,634
You're going to sneak into the
magistrate's office, nin nin?

477
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,537
Well, this idiot here, he just
won't take no for an answer.

478
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,272
And I thought you're a ninja,

479
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,940
so that means you're good
at that kind of stuff.

480
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,975
‐So, please.
‐What are you asking for, nin nin ?

481
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,710
Can you turn him
into a ninja, too?

482
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,913
Are you underestimating
the ninja, nin nin?

483
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,782
Do all ninja have to say "nin nin"
at the end of each phrase?

484
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:57,750
My name's not "nin nin."

485
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,784
It's Katsura.

486
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,887
But you can't possibly become
a ninja overnight, no way.

487
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,124
We girls shed blood, sweat,
and tears to become ninjas!

488
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,059
Don't you underestimate us, nin nin!

489
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,594
Manager, aren't you a man?

490
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,964
Then, I ask you, could you at
least come with us, Thatcher!

491
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,732
I'm not the iron lady!

492
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,534
I wanna be just like you, snatcher!

493
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,637
Stop calling me a snatcher,
I'm Sacchan, dumb‐ass.

494
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:19,872
I'm terribly sorry,

495
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,907
but I have past connections
with the government,

496
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,709
so I can't do anything stupid...

497
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,277
See, look here.

498
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,612
I've got a call for work...

499
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,586
Are you insulting us?

500
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,755
Stop messing with your phone
while you are with a customer!

501
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:39,491
You're awfully harsh with me.

502
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,659
Why are you blushing?

503
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,094
Why are you smiling?

504
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:44,330
You don't have connections
with the government anymore.

505
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,799
‐So you can help us Hey!
‐Hey! What are you doing?!

506
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,467
‐Hurry up and bring my damn tea!
‐Yes, sir!

507
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,635
I'll be right with you, nin‐nin.

508
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,204
I'm very sorry, but like I said,
I can't come with you.

509
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,973
I'm too busy with
my daytime job.

510
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,074
See ya!

511
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,642
Here's your tea, nin nin!

512
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,779
Here's your cake, too, and it's
on the house now!

513
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,482
Hey, Sacchan!
What are you doing to him?!

514
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,517
That's enough from you.
Now you are fired.

515
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:06,752
But...!

516
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,387
‐Manager!
‐I'm over here.

517
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:11,957
Oh!
My glasses...

518
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:13,659
Oh, when did that happen?

519
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,494
‐Hey, over here.
‐Oh?

520
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,763
You left your glasses here...

521
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,300
Oh, Sacchan, you're so careless,
aren't you?

522
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,969
But now that you don't have
any restraints...

523
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,137
Let's go.

524
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:26,038
Uh so...

525
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,206
Look, Sacchan...

526
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:28,440
I'm very sorry...

527
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:29,842
Ah...

528
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,010
I just want to be bullied
some more.

529
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,045
What?!
You're such a freak!

530
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,314
Well, I'm going to pound
into your little heads

531
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:37,916
everything that there is to
know about being a ninja...

532
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:38,851
First.

533
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,886
A ninja must be
like a shadow.

534
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,354
They do their work
so discreetly

535
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,889
that no one ever know
they are there...

536
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,325
Whatever you do,
you must be inconspicuous!

537
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,028
Inconspicuous?
Just look at us!

538
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,729
What are we, the Power Dudes?

539
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,466
Well, it doesn't matter, anyway,
I can't tell your faces apart.

540
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,868
Everyone but Gin looks
all the same to me.

541
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,102
We're like pebbles
on the ground?

542
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,772
Oh, Gin, your scarf
isn't tied right.

543
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,206
You're so careless,
you know.

544
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,675
You can't do anything
without me.

545
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,510
You can't tell anyone
apart period!

546
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,178
And you still can't recognize
anyone, come on!

547
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,313
Put your glasses on!

548
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,581
By the way,
why is my color yellow?

549
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,517
The leader is supposed
to wear red.

550
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:12,551
I wanna wear red.

551
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,053
Don't fight me on this, Cobra.

552
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:15,654
Red is my symbolic color.

553
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,555
So I'm the captain.

554
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,558
It's not very convincing, but it's
fine if I have no other choice.

555
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,293
As the captain,
I make the orders.

556
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,295
Yellow ninja, your favorite
food is curry,

557
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,030
so you must always
carry curry with you.

558
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,199
Hey, Shinpachi, can you
trade your outfit with me?

559
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,001
It's so white that
I'm sure I'll stain it

560
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,169
when I eat my curry noodles.

561
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,404
Who gives a crap about
curry or curry noodles!

562
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,139
What did you come here to do?!

563
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:37,509
<i>Thus it happened,</i>

564
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,078
<i>we teamed up as</i>
<i>the Power Ninjas</i>

565
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,679
<i>to sneak into the</i>
<i>Magistrate's office</i>

566
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,214
<i>where Elizabeth</i>
<i>is being held...</i>

567
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:45,084
<i>But there were powerful foes</i>
<i>waiting for us in the path ahead!</i>

568
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:45,951
<i>The next episode...</i>
