1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,812
Lucky voodoo dolls
from Planet Wheeler, man!

2
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,914
They make any wishes
come true.

3
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:16,984
You make the wish and then,
you give it as a gift too!

4
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,819
Hey, man, is that for real?

5
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,088
Yeah, yeah, it is so for real.

6
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:21,955
You tell me, man.

7
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,724
What is the wish
you want to make?

8
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,692
‐I would wish for eggs.
‐For eggs?

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,061
I wish that she would get better
at cooking eggs.

10
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,667
Thanks for the purchase, man!

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,470
You know, this doll looks
awfully familiar to me.

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,871
What was it?

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:42,075
Huh? Why does a lucky charm doll
have a space monster tag?

14
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,710
Excuse me.

15
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,178
Run away!

16
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,206
Hey, sis, I'm home!

17
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,074
Oh, well.

18
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,310
Things like these
are all about believing.

19
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,312
Maybe a miracle
will occur today

20
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:29,016
and my sister's omelet will actually
be much better, even edible.

21
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,918
It's not like
I was cheated.

22
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,422
It's not like
I got ripped off!

23
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,660
Hey, sis, I'm home.

24
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,230
Hey, sis?

25
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,932
But wait, she's not here?

26
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,039
Die, scum!

27
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,978
Wh... wh... wh... what the heck
are you doing, sis, huh?

28
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,113
Are you trying to kill
your own brother?

29
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,748
Oh, it's you, Shinpachi.

30
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,283
Oh, no! Stefan!

31
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,318
There's a hole
in Stefan's stomach!

32
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,054
You shouldn't come back
home at a time like this.

33
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,922
It's very confusing.

34
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,857
Don't... don't come back home?

35
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,027
But... but how can you say that
to your dearly beloved brother?

36
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,663
Listen up, I had a lot of trouble
while you were away.

37
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,732
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

38
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,868
Your... your personality
has totally changed, sis.

39
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,670
What... what happened to you?

40
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,473
What happened to me,
he asks, huh?

41
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:30,143
Ah! Just thinking about
what happened pisses me off!

42
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,746
No! Stefan!

43
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,982
Wait, was that not a
key part of today's story?

44
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,925
<i>A panty thief, huh?</i>

45
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,761
‐Yeah, that's right.
‐A chocolate sundae?

46
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,396
‐That's mine.
‐...during the days I stayed over...

47
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,363
‐The hamburger steak...
‐...at your place.

48
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,466
‐...spaghetti Neapolitan...
‐Can't we do anything about it?

49
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,868
Can't we do anything
about what?

50
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,938
About the panty thief
I was talking about!

51
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,773
A panty thief, huh?

52
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,274
That's right, I said.

53
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,576
She got hit twice
during the days

54
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,611
I stayed over at your place.

55
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,613
Can't we do anything
about it?

56
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,149
Can't we do anything
about what?

57
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,250
I keep telling you!

58
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,519
The panty thief!
The panty thief!

59
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,392
Yeah, what about it?

60
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,829
I swear this guy is totally
doing that on purpose!

61
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,499
You know, they say that
back in the old days,

62
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,434
women didn't wear panties
under their kimonos.

63
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,304
Young ladies, gals, girls,
princesses, all of them, no panties!

64
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,807
You're only referring
to a single age group.

65
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,275
Shouldn't you be saying
something more like,

66
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,944
grannies, women,
young women, and girls?

67
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,279
You fool!

68
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,649
When you talk about underpants,
panties, and no panties,

69
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,051
it can only refer
to young women!

70
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,721
Yeah, but only
old guys say panties.

71
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:48,855
What? For real?

72
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,891
Scanties are also no good.

73
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,893
Nobody says that
these days, Gin.

74
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,562
The one that I can't stand
are those thongs.

75
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,265
They took away
girls' modesty

76
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,133
as well as the pleasure
from men.

77
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,335
I'm wearing
a g‐string right now.

78
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,237
You're lying!
Theres no way!

79
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,539
No, I'm not lying.

80
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,807
I've been wearing
the same pair for years.

81
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,277
It's so worn out,
only the strings are left.

82
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,778
What kind of panties
are those?

83
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,314
In a way,
these are vintage panties.

84
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,183
It's worthless,
not even worth a cent.

85
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:16,950
Just dump it.

86
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,352
Anyway, women in the old days
didn't put on underwear,

87
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,854
they were perpetually
commando.

88
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,657
Wow, just thinking about it,
though you're a princess,

89
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,193
under that dress
you're a wildcat.

90
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,727
That's kind of hot,
kind of like...

91
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:31,498
She has this calm demeanor,
but whoa, look out secretly.

92
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,767
She's a beast,
like Rocky, right?

93
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:34,768
I mean...

94
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,805
Now is not the time for
your weird fantasies and lectures.

95
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,508
There is a thief who stole
my lucky panties, damn it!

96
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,376
Stole your lucky panties?

97
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,612
Are you planning
on going to Vegas, sister?

98
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,247
Hell, yeah.
Of course I am!

99
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,682
As a matter of fact,
I'm planning on it

100
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,117
being a high roller night,
you fool!

101
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,385
Don't underestimate me.

102
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,020
So, what exactly do you want?

103
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,323
Do you want it back
just for your gambling run?

104
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,858
Or would simply getting it
back satisfy you?

105
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,794
I want my panties
back regardless,

106
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,230
and then I want to slowly break
every bone in the thief's body.

107
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,664
Uh, really, sis?

108
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,266
Your statements aren't
those of a modern,

109
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,201
panty wearing person anymore.

110
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,736
It's more of a naked
jungle warrioress

111
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,305
from 20,000 years ago
type of statement.

112
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:16,276
A panty thief is the enemy
of all women, uh‐huh!

113
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,144
Big sis, I'm with you
on this one!

114
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,747
Oh, Kagura, my dear friend!

115
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,682
Well said, my sister!

116
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,418
Come with me! Let's pledge
our sisterhood with a drink.

117
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,553
‐Yes, ma'am!
‐Wait, wait!

118
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,587
Someone will die!

119
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,190
You two together
are way too dangerous!

120
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:30,991
This is so bad!

121
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:34,127
The deadliest combatants
in the world have joined forces.

122
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,328
Forget about it.

123
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,564
We already know
who the culprit is, don't we?

124
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,033
And who could it be?

125
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,738
Am I caught then?

126
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,972
No, damn it!

127
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,173
But maybe I am not caught?

128
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,975
Whoa, I really am caught?

129
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,243
What is this?!

130
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,912
Are you suspecting me of
being the thief, you bastards?

131
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,848
No, there's no way!

132
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,684
There's no way that a samurai
would ever do something so vile

133
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,552
and so low as stealing panties.

134
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,455
There's no way a samurai
would be stalking a girl either.

135
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,358
I may be a stalker, sure,
but I would never steal panties!

136
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,893
I am going to sue you
for slander!

137
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,995
You're the one
who will be getting sued!

138
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,531
So this is it for
the Shinsengumi, eh?

139
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,166
What a joyous occasion!

140
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,467
Wait, wait, wait!

141
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,236
Take a look
at this right here!

142
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,204
What is this about?

143
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,608
<i>Masked loincloth bandit</i>
<i>strikes again?</i>

144
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,878
This guy is the petty thief
that's been terrorizing the city recently.

145
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,881
As the name might suggest,
his costume is pretty peculiar.

146
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,131
<i>He wraps a red loincloth</i>
<i>around his face</i>

147
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,667
<i>and he runs through</i>
<i>the darkness in his briefs...</i>

148
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,271
<i>stealing all the pretty</i>
<i>girls' panties.</i>

149
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,240
<i>And then he tosses them</i>
<i>to guys who can't get dates.</i>

150
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,543
<i>A very unusual fellow.</i>

151
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,052
What the hell is this?

152
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,254
Some perverted version
of Robin Hood?

153
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,691
I see. So, that's the story
behind these panties.

154
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,260
I thought it was a present
from Santa himself.

155
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,129
You got a pair of panties?

156
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,797
And you thought
it was from Santa?

157
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,132
It's totally out of season!

158
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:22,635
Shut up! Kabukicho's Santa works
24/7 all year round!

159
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,138
That means the panty thief

160
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,940
thinks you're a loser
who can't get girls.

161
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,375
Oh, how pathetic!

162
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,710
Oh, but take a look
at your own costume!

163
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,346
Because it looks like Santa
paid you a visit too, pal!

164
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,516
This isn't... this isn't a charity
panty from the Masked Loincloth!

165
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,418
That makes it worse,
doesn't it?

166
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,019
Eh... uh... what?! Oh!

167
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,454
So, what you're trying
to say to us now

168
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,923
is that it's this guy who
stole Otae's panties?

169
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,227
That's right!
Precisely.

170
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:50,096
Almost every girl in the Edo City
has been his victim,

171
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,798
but due to his public popularity,

172
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,600
especially from
the unpopular men,

173
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,135
the police seem
to be having a hard time

174
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,936
capturing this panty thief.

175
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,873
So, the pervert thinks
he's a benevolent thief?

176
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,341
I can't stand it.

177
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,709
I can't stand it one bit!

178
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,377
How the hell does he know
I can't get girls?

179
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,879
‐No! The panties!
‐No! The panties!

180
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,183
<i>The 35th Wacky Mission</i>

181
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:13,653
<i>capture the Masked Loincloth!</i>

182
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,822
‐Yeah! Yeah!
‐Yeah! Yeah!

183
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,057
35th Wacky Mission?

184
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:22,028
And now a brief word
from Mr. Isao Kondo,

185
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,897
the committee chief executive.

186
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,436
Uh, the Shinsengumi exists
to keep peace in this city.

187
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,037
What exactly is peace?

188
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,339
It's the right to live
in this city safely

189
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,141
for people to live
in happiness.

190
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,676
The small happiness
of each person

191
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,012
will create peace
for the entire city!

192
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,915
And therefore, Shinpachi.

193
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,216
Protecting your sister's panties

194
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,552
is also the mission
of the Shinsengumi.

195
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,456
Boy, when it comes to making up
stupid excuses for missions,

196
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,491
our commander is really
the best at it.

197
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:52,892
Hey!

198
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,529
By the way, what exactly is
the Shinsengumi doing here?

199
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,331
We're here for revenge.

200
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,200
Right, Hijikata?

201
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,073
What an idiot
to give Hijikata

202
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,742
a pair of charity panties,
isn't that right?

203
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,118
There will be no mercy!

204
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,720
His eyes are totally serious!

205
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,056
<i>Okay, our new mission is...</i>

206
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:26,092
<i>capture the Masked Loincloth</i>
<i>featuring pretty women.</i>

207
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,727
‐Yeah! Yeah!
‐Yeah! Yeah!

208
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,063
What do you mean
"featuring pretty women"?

209
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,665
Well, let's get started again.

210
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,702
This time, we've decided
to use a decoy operation

211
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,371
with the full cooperation
of Miss Otae Shimura.

212
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,573
Decoy operation? Oh!

213
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,177
I will offer my lucky panties.

214
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:47,113
It's gonna knock you out
like Mickey Rourke's cat punch.

215
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,081
Cat punch?

216
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:50,517
Just hold on!

217
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,751
That's too hardcore!

218
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,253
Normal boys can't handle it.

219
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,587
They'll run their ass off.

220
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,723
Then, how about this?

221
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,358
This packs the same punch

222
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,693
that knocked the famous
sumo wrestler down.

223
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,729
Knocked...?

224
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:04,864
No, no, no, no!

225
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,099
That's way too maniacal!

226
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,167
Hey guys, can you think
a little more about the brother

227
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,602
who has to see
his sister's panties

228
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,271
over and over again?

229
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,039
It's even worse than
watching a sex scene

230
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,275
on TV with your whole family.

231
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,811
And that's how a little boy
climbs up the ladder to adulthood.

232
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,581
You there, don't just dismiss
the situation!

233
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:24,651
I'm sorry to say, but seeing
your sister's panties is nothing!

234
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:28,121
For example, Hijikata once saw
his father wearing a bra.

235
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,190
Now, I get it.

236
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,493
It was so shocking that his pupils
are still wide open to this day.

237
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,261
Like hell they are!

238
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:39,399
I'm risking my life
as well as my panties here!

239
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,467
Stop messing around
and get to work right now,

240
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,802
you freaking idiots!

241
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,737
‐Y... yes, ma'am.
‐Y... yes, ma'am.

242
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,941
Big sis, you are so cool!

243
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,677
Listen up!

244
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,447
This thief is a genuine pervert
who prefers quality over quantity

245
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,382
when it comes
to girls' panties.

246
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,618
Therefore he'll definitely
sneak in here again.

247
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,386
That's when we can catch him.

248
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,288
I don't care if he is
the Masked Loincloth

249
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,523
or Masked Panty thief.

250
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:04,857
We cannot forgive
the way he tramples

251
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,595
over a girl's innocence
as well as a man's pride.

252
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,097
All pumped up and ready
to kick some ass,

253
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,366
we'll bring him down
with a single blow!

254
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:16,302
We'll stain his white briefs red
with his own blood!

255
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,137
‐Yeah!
‐Yeah!

256
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,625
Excuse me!

257
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,328
Aren't you all becoming a little
too psychotic over a panty thief?

258
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:45,999
What I mean is, do we really need
the Shinsengumi for this?

259
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,400
What are you saying?

260
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,568
Even I can...

261
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,104
attack!

262
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,408
Now, now...

263
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,143
I thought something
like this would happen,

264
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,611
so I brought these
from the warehouse.

265
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,613
Wait, what is all of this?

266
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,415
How should I put it?

267
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,717
Something like... land mines?

268
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,585
Not "something like"!

269
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,387
That's exactly what it is!

270
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,555
I had a hard time sneaking
them out of the castle,

271
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,057
with all the security there.

272
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,725
Takes a thief
to catch a thief.

273
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,227
Something like that?

274
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,496
<i>Place these mines</i>
<i>in the surrounding area,</i>

275
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,164
<i>and I guarantee this old dojo</i>

276
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,867
<i>will become an invincible</i>
<i>and totally secure fortress.</i>

277
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,935
<i>I'm fine with it staying</i>
<i>as an old dojo!</i>

278
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,504
<i>Besides, isn't this illegal?</i>

279
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,639
<i>It's totally against</i>
<i>the Geneva Convention!</i>

280
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,508
Well, they have their rules,
and we have ours.

281
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,543
Don't you talk to me
like some mom would!

282
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,513
A land mine is nothing more
than a weapon of war!

283
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:34,380
No, it's not.

284
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:39,185
The official name is
something like a land mine.

285
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,420
What?

286
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,456
Hey, Shin...
this here is a battlefield.

287
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,991
If this is too much
for you to handle,

288
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,759
then I think you should
just go home.

289
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,594
But, sis, this is my home.

290
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,096
So, how can I just go home?

291
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,832
It takes a real samurai
to call the battlefield home.

292
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,334
Well, that's not exactly
what I meant!

293
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,636
Accusing someone as suspicious

294
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,871
and cutting them into bits
without a second thought.

295
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,973
I've missed this.

296
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,543
Accusing? Whoa!

297
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:06,345
No, if anything we should
skewer them with a spear.

298
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,748
Even better would be
to crush them into paste.

299
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,583
How about we tear them up
and pluck them out?

300
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,686
Twisting, breaking,
rolling, and boiling?

301
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,189
Hey, you two are scaring me!

302
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,125
My back really hurts.

303
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,127
We're not working
on a farm here!

304
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:24,163
This is the most dangerous
landscaping work in the world!

305
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,233
<i>Quit being annoying, Yamazaki!</i>

306
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,210
How come I always get...?

307
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,079
It's because your blood
is so sweet.

308
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:40,913
The sugar?

309
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,649
We really don't care about
your blood sugar levels, Gin.

310
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,953
More importantly, I don't see
any signs of the thief appearing.

311
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,157
Maybe the panty thief
is not coming today.

312
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:54,227
I mean, not only today,
but never again!

313
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,329
Don't worry,
I know that he'll come.

314
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,931
What do you mean? On what basis
are you saying that?

315
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,868
Look at those panties just
hanging out in the open like that.

316
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,570
What panty thief could
resist such a target?

317
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,639
But the thing is,
it's too obvious!

318
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,441
You can totally tell
it's a trap!

319
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,275
Shin...

320
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,311
The thing about thieves is
that the more difficult the task is

321
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,947
the more encouraged
they get to actually do it.

322
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,083
Now, how the heck
would you know that?

323
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,418
And what if he is
a totally wussy thief?

324
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,088
Does it really even matter
who we catch?

325
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,891
Let's just grab someone
and say that he's the thief.

326
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,160
Well, if we can agree
on a story, it'll work.

327
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,394
Someone, as in who?

328
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,428
Agreeing on what?

329
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,998
Hey, hey, stop yelling,
Shinpachi.

330
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,734
If the crook hears you,
it'll ruin the surprise.

331
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,402
What I want to ruin is you!

332
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,272
‐This heat is enough to deal with, damn it.
‐What did you say, you bastard?

333
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,606
How about I ventilate your face?!

334
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,508
‐If you think I'm gonna even let you...
‐Hey, don't push me.

335
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,511
‐...then you are utterly mistaken, you idiot!
‐It's too hot!

336
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,046
You think we should
help them out?

337
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,981
If you're gonna fight,
then go hard.

338
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,984
Make sure your opponent
wont ever be able to walk again.

339
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,587
My fist wants to join
in the fight too!

340
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,623
Somebody, let my fists
taste your blood!

341
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,593
Hey, stop it, stop it now!

342
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:01,794
No more fighting!

343
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,064
You guys are just getting irritated
because of the heat.

344
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,550
All right, why don't we
take a break?

345
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,100
Shut up mite beards!

346
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,400
Shut up, ass hair!

347
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,536
Shut up, Mr. Tangle.

348
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,005
‐Shut up, you stalker!
‐Shut up, Gorilla.

349
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,575
It's just the heat, right?

350
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,044
That's gotta be it,
that is all.

351
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,813
Okay, why don't I go
and get something cold?

352
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,249
It'll help calm everyone down,
don't you think?

353
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,550
I'll be right back!

354
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,550
Ice cream!

355
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,200
A parfait or something!

356
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,000
Bargain Dash Ice Cream!

357
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,150
Seafood vinaigrette!

358
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,720
Beef bowl and spaghetti with
500 ml bottle of mayonnaise on the side!

359
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,727
Oh, some tea!

360
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,062
Alright, enough already.

361
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,964
I'll go get them.
Just chill out.

362
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,499
Good grief, unbelievable!

363
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,842
Oh, no, Kondo just blew
himself up!

364
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,944
Well, it was very hot after all.

365
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,446
I guess that would
blow you away.

366
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:54,413
No, that's not it!

367
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,250
He just stepped on a land mine
that he planted himself.

368
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,018
They could be anywhere
around this place.

369
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,119
What an idiot!

370
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,123
Uh... uh, wait a second, guys.

371
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,225
Please, don't tell me
none of you remember

372
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,194
where you set up
the land mines?

373
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:10,963
Oh my goodness!

374
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,866
The mailman is going to get
blown to bits tomorrow morning!

375
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,202
Is that what we're worrying
about right now?

376
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,672
Th... that man...

377
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,408
Where there's light,
there is shadow.

378
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,810
Where there's men,
there is a baldie

379
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,480
pulled by the elastic
bands of panties.

380
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,016
Tonight, I run the path
of men's dreams!

381
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:33,552
I am the Masked Loincloth Bandit

382
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,787
and here I come!

383
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,489
Hysterical!

384
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:37,723
You guys are priceless!

385
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,092
It appears you've prepared
a warm welcoming for me,

386
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,761
but I fear it's all in vain!

387
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:42,995
No, this sucks!

388
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,364
He came at the worst
possible moment ever!

389
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,768
Did you really think that I'd fall
for such childish tricks?

390
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,836
You've underestimated
the Masked Loincloth,

391
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,872
the greatest bandit
of this land!

392
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,107
If you come up here,
I'd fight you!

393
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,711
Or you can sit there
biting your fingernails

394
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,781
and watch as your panties
are handed over to perverts,

395
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:06,152
dweebs, cherry boys,
and delusional horny S. O. B.'s!

396
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,755
Here I come!

397
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,461
It's what you'd call,
taking extra measures.

398
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,540
Go, Yamazaki!

399
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,908
Beat him up!

400
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,810
You got it, Vice‐chief!

401
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,814
Get ready to die...!

402
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,803
What the hell
did he show up for?

403
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,741
You useless Shinsengumi.

404
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:19,558
There was a land mine placed
under the floor boards too, huh?

405
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,893
It sure looks like it.

406
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,628
Hey, that is...

407
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:32,938
You fools!

408
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:37,209
You can't defeat me
with something like this.

409
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,248
Perverts, dweebs, cherry boys,
and delusional horny S. O. B.'s

410
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,517
across the country
await my return!

411
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,685
Their voices give me power!

412
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,586
Can you hear that?

413
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,788
Their voices?

414
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:52,925
<i>Masked Loincloth,</i>
<i>please, give us hope!</i>

415
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,927
<i>Rough nylon panties,</i>

416
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,896
<i>smooth silk panties,</i>

417
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:59,498
<i>fluffy cotton panties,</i>
<i>anything is fine!</i>

418
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,567
<i>Just one pair of panties</i>

419
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,270
<i>is enough for us</i>
<i>to live another day.</i>

420
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,306
<i>Enough for us to stand tall</i>
<i>and keep on going!</i>

421
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,709
<i>Can you hear?</i>

422
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,278
<i>Can you hear all</i>
<i>of their silent cries?</i>

423
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,481
Failure is never an option!

424
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:19,952
For the honor of the Masked Loincloth,
I will return to them all!

425
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,187
Wait there!

426
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,658
Keep your filthy paws off
of Otae's panties!

427
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,360
Come on, I haven't even gotten
to touch them yet, damn it!

428
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:29,862
‐Let me go!
‐It's your turn!

429
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:33,332
You gorilla with a butt hair
growing from your chin!

430
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,100
You're the missing link
in human evolution!

431
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,804
Do you think such descriptive abuse
would make me flinch?

432
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,240
Odd Jobs!
What are you waiting for?

433
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,309
Hurry, I'll let you
have this one!

434
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,577
Hurry up!
It's your turn!

435
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,248
No need to tell me that.

436
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,016
Hold on tight, Kondo!

437
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,985
Don't let go of his hairy legs!

438
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,697
No!

439
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,945
It looks like I get
the last laugh, after all!

440
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,951
Don't...

441
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,690
‐What is that?!
‐...underestimate us women!

442
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,271
There's no way
I'll ever give my panties

443
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:47,106
to someone who
won't even show his face.

444
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,477
If you really want this,
approach me directly,

445
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,845
naked from head to toe.

446
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,847
I mean with an open
naked heart.

447
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,430
I have no panties
in my hands!

448
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:19,371
Hey, sis!

449
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,808
Big sister, you're the best!

450
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:36,989
Hijikata, it was actually me
that gave you the charity panties.

451
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,157
What was that?

452
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:40,226
It was a joke, a joke!

453
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:41,760
You wanna die?

454
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:43,329
You wait here!

455
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,197
Stay right there!

456
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,831
<i>The beach? Nah, no can do.</i>

457
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,232
<i>Apparently the beach is closed off</i>

458
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,567
<i>because of a man‐ eating alien.</i>

459
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,602
<i>But, There's a bounty on that alien?</i>

460
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,139
<i>All right! This summer weâ€™re going</i>
<i>to be fly fishing for aliens!</i>

461
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,274
The next episode...

462
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,693
I have a fabulous gift
for you unpopular folk

463
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,829
watching anime alone
at such an hour!

464
00:24:57,363 --> 00:25:00,232
Send us a postcard addressed
below with your address,

465
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,635
name, age and the reason why
you think you can't get a girl.

466
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:05,904
We're looking forward
to hearing from you...

467
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,539
No, we are not!
