1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:02,836
<i>"Dear Kagura.</i>

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,671
<i>I hope you're doing well.</i>

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,507
<i>Beside the fact that all</i>
<i>my hair follicles have died,</i>

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,276
<i>your papa's doing just fine.</i>

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,080
<i>I'm still flying through</i>
<i>the galaxy chasing Aliens</i>

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,648
<i>as I always have been.</i>

7
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,483
<i>I've been quite busy</i>
<i>lately though,</i>

8
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,051
<i>getting mixed up</i>
<i>in a battle between</i>

9
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:21,688
<i>the Earth Federation and</i>
<i>the Principality Force of some planét."</i>

10
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,490
So tell me,
are you ready to fight?

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,958
Just how bold can you be?

12
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,327
Until a while back,
I was bald only on the top,

13
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,762
but now I'm all bald!

14
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,664
<i>"I wasn't asking about your hair.</i>

15
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,799
<i>Anyway, now that I'm here,</i>

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,636
<i>I'm sure the Principality Force</i>
<i>will win."</i>

17
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:38,405
As of today,
I will be in command!

18
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,474
Everyone must shave
their heads!

19
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:44,077
Anyone who grows hair
will be publicly spanked!

20
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,414
<i>"Anyway, are you enjoying</i>
<i>yourself, Kagura?</i>

21
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,917
<i>Is that silver‐haired guy</i>
<i>bullying you?</i>

22
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,919
<i>Is that four‐eyes</i>
<i>giving you dirty looks,"</i>

23
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>as all teenage boys would?</i>

24
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,758
My daughter is studying
abroad over on Earth.

25
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:58,926
Seriously?

26
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,527
You must be worried about her.

27
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,830
<i>"If anything happens,</i>
<i>just let me know.</i>

28
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,832
<i>Papa will come</i>
<i>slaughter everybody.</i>

29
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:06,667
<i>Good‐bye."</i>

30
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,068
<i>I'll write again soon.</i>

31
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,838
<i>"P.S. I forget to say one thing.</i>

32
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:15,042
<i>It's about that big dog</i>
<i>you're keeping.</i>

33
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,777
<i>It's actually a terrible monster,</i>

34
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,779
<i>so you should get rid</i>
<i>of it immediately."</i>

35
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,348
It's too late
to tell me that, baldy.

36
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:24,318
And besides, no matter
what anyone says,

37
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,987
I'm never leaving you,
right, Sadaharu?

38
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,048
<i>So you see, the game scheduled</i>
<i>for the dome was cancelled,</i>

39
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,384
<i>and to compensate for all</i>
<i>the financial damage that was caused,</i>

40
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,852
<i>we had to sell our shrine.</i>

41
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,489
<i>I can't believe we have to go through</i>
<i>all this because of a damn dog.</i>

42
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,025
<i>‐Oh, my!</i>
<i>‐And now, my sister and I...</i>

43
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,361
<i>are back to living</i>
<i>in an apartment.</i>

44
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,763
That's why men
are just like dogs.

45
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,732
You dump 'em without
a second thought,

46
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,700
and they eventually
come back to bite you.

47
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,802
Oh, don't worry about men.

48
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,403
They're more stupid than dogs.

49
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,539
Ms. Ané, you've been requested.

50
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,707
You have a customer
at table 3.

51
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,242
Coming.

52
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,311
Is it Mr. Kikuya again?

53
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,413
That pervert's really into you.

54
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,849
Well, like I said,
they always come back.

55
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:36,817
They're so stupid.

56
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,352
They get so worked up
just because I'm a shrine maiden.

57
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,789
Nurses, shrine maidens,
and flight attendants.

58
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,859
These men must have
insAné fantasies about women.

59
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,763
Women are all born
from piles of shit.

60
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:53,100
We're all just battling
the flies buzzing around us.

61
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,484
Hi, Sir, your Ané is here!

62
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,052
I'm so glad you came to see...

63
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,493
Your Ané is here, Mr. Kikuya.

64
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,730
What the hell are you doing?

65
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,266
I was filling in for you
until you showed up, Ané,

66
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,634
but the jerk grabbed my butt.

67
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,735
I was shocked, and...

68
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,903
I'm the one who's shocked!

69
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,172
What are you doing
to my customer?

70
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:35,275
I'm sorry, since he's not my customer,
I figured it would be okay.

71
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,910
You know damn well it isn't!

72
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,479
It's my way of welcoming
a customer. Sorry.

73
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,915
Look here, just because
that stalker gorilla of yours

74
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,316
doesn't mind being beaten up,

75
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:47,020
that doesn't mean you can
treat everyone else that way!

76
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,922
Who are you calling
a stalker gorilla?!

77
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,257
That's so rude of you!

78
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,893
Otae, you should really
say something too!

79
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,060
All right then.

80
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,595
Please get lost, gorilla.

81
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,564
No, that's not what I meant!

82
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:58,465
I wish you would disappear

83
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,168
without leaving a single
ribosome behind, gorilla.

84
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,936
No, that's not what I meant!

85
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,437
And while you're at it,
erase all the memories

86
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,174
of your existence from anyone
you've ever encountered, gorilla.

87
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,009
No, that's not what I meant.

88
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,179
Come on, calm down, Ané.

89
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,181
You're alarming the other customers.

90
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,717
Otae definitely went too far,
but Mr. Kikuya is also to blame.

91
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,152
He keeps trying
to turn this place

92
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,254
into an all‐you‐can grope buffet.

93
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,356
The other hostesses
don't like him either.

94
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,491
Your butt?

95
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,327
What's the big deal
about getting your butt groped?

96
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,763
Do you know why
your butt is split in two?

97
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,499
It's so that you won't mind
if someone touches one half of it.

98
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,034
No, that's definitely not why.

99
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,468
If he touches
your left butt cheek,

100
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,404
then let him touch
your right butt cheek!

101
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,371
Everyone knows that!

102
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,539
You're wrong!

103
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,742
Our butt cheeks are vestiges
of when we were all angels.

104
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:43,910
They used to be wings.

105
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,412
I don't think that's right either.

106
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,179
What's with that?

107
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,447
Are you trying
to be romantic?

108
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,317
You just sound like
an idiot out of this world!

109
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,352
Then how about boobs?!

110
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,587
Boobs are also off limits.

111
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,991
They're vestiges of when humans
used to be living arsenals.

112
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,425
They were missiles.

113
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,228
Just what do you think
humans used to be, Otae?

114
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,199
Okay, I'm not running a
Touchy Touchy Pub over here,

115
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,003
you know, but it's not an
S&M bar either, okay?

116
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:46,439
This isn't the place for
enjoying sadistic shows, right?

117
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,674
‐Aye, aye, captain!
‐Aye, aye, captain!

118
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,542
Aye, aye, captain?
Hang on a second.

119
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,945
Are you two girls playing
a pirate game or something?

120
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,246
‐Aye, aye, captain!
‐Aye, aye, captain!

121
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,016
Oh, man, you two
are really getting on my nerves.

122
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,851
Okay then, listen, Otae,

123
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:01,788
I aware that I put you on bouncer duty
to take care of any customers

124
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:02,989
that cause some trouble,

125
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,493
but in my honest opinion, I think
you've been taking it too far lately.

126
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,895
I'll try not to throw them too far.

127
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:13,466
No, I'm not really talking about how far
you can throw the guys, Otae.

128
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,703
And as for you, Ané,
I realize that you need money,

129
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,439
but your methods
are a bit unscrupulous.

130
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,408
I've received many complaints
from customers

131
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,342
that you've dumped them

132
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,412
after they'd given you
every cent in their wallets.

133
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,913
I haven't dumped them.

134
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,016
I tend to recycle men who
can save up enough money

135
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,551
and crawl back to me.

136
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:36,656
Yes, well I've never heard of such
environmentally unfriendly recycling.

137
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:44,798
Now then, the two of you are a couple
of the best selling girls here.

138
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,200
I'd really like to be
patient with you two...

139
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,869
but this business
is not going to survive

140
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,672
with two nuclear warheads
here at the same time.

141
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:56,443
And that is why I'm going
to need one of you to quit.

142
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,310
What?!

143
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,920
<i>The one who'll remain is...</i>

144
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:10,256
<i>Well, tomorrow is the day</i>
<i>we tally this month's profit,</i>

145
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,325
<i>so I think the one who brings in</i>

146
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,661
<i>more profit tomorrow will stay.</i>

147
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,896
<i>He can't be serious.</i>

148
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:20,066
<i>At a time when I'm already</i>
<i>struggling to make a living</i>

149
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,801
<i>and have to work even harder.</i>

150
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,703
<i>Damn that annoying girl.</i>

151
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:27,374
<i>How many of my customers</i>
<i>have fallen victim to her barbarism?</i>

152
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,345
<i>She's never sold nearly</i>
<i>as many drinks as I have.</i>

153
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,080
<i>And yet everyone likes her.</i>

154
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,250
<i>I've never liked that</i>
<i>about her at all.</i>

155
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,955
<i>This is the perfect chance</i>
<i>to drive her out of the bar!</i>

156
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:42,889
Ané.

157
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,329
It seems like things
have gotten a little out of hand.

158
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,430
I'm very sorry.

159
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,065
I got us into this whole mess.

160
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,968
I see what you're trying to do, girl.

161
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,370
Don't worry about it at all.

162
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,572
Let's just both
try our best tomorrow.

163
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,042
<i>You're just trying to drop</i>
<i>my guard, aren't you?</i>

164
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,245
About our competition...

165
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,115
‐I would like to withdraw from it.
‐What?

166
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,051
I heard from everyone, Ané.

167
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,455
I heard how you had to sell off
all the properties of your shrine,

168
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,992
and I also heard that you're having
a really hard time right now.

169
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,329
And on top of that, you're looking
after your sister, who can't go outside.

170
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,200
I can't compete with you, Ané.

171
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,170
I know that you're working harder
than everyone else here.

172
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,440
Good luck, Ané!

173
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,841
I'm rooting for you.

174
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,114
<i>What just happened?</i>

175
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,686
<i>That caught me</i>
<i>totally off guard.</i>

176
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,588
<i>That girl doesn't make any sense.</i>

177
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,557
<i>But...</i>

178
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,226
<i>I think I understand</i>
<i>just a little bit...</i>

179
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,628
<i>why everyone likes her.</i>

180
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,547
<i>Welcome gentleman!</i>
<i>Is it just two of you?</i>

181
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,617
This is the place, huh?

182
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,519
You're sure this is the right place?

183
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,055
Hey, hey, isn't this place expensive?

184
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,423
You sure it's okay?

185
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,360
Oh! You're from the Odd Jobs!

186
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,195
Oh, the shameless shrine maiden.

187
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,263
You're working here, too?

188
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,498
Who're you calling shameless?

189
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:34,000
What're you doing here anyway?!

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,369
I know someone who works here.

191
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,371
Sir, shall I call a particular girl?

192
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,106
Call Otae for me, please.

193
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,608
O...!

194
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,043
Hi, Gin, how is it going?

195
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,578
Right this way.

196
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,413
‐Dirty player!
‐It's hot, hot, hot!

197
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,649
She's been making
sales calls behind my back!

198
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,352
It's been so long since
I've been in a place like this.

199
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,154
Hey, you're gonna give us
a deal, right?

200
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,890
We haven't got much money.

201
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:01,461
<i>Ané, I heard that you are</i>
<i>really struggling to pay back</i>

202
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,062
<i>what you borrowed.</i>

203
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,999
<i>I can't... I can't compete</i>
<i>with you, Ané.</i>

204
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:12,071
<i>As if... I couldn't care less</i>
<i>about your shrine.</i>

205
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:16,109
<i>I have my own oath to keep</i>
<i>to restore my father's dojo.</i>

206
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,579
<i>She tricked me!</i>

207
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,414
<i>How could I have been</i>
<i>so stupid?</i>

208
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,485
<i>That freaking liar!</i>

209
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,469
<i>She... she tricked me!</i>

210
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,605
<i>How could I have been so stupid?!</i>

211
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,077
<i>That freaking liar!</i>

212
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,981
<i>Shoot! Do I still have time</i>
<i>to catch up?</i>

213
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,251
Hi, I'm Oryo.

214
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,486
Hey, you've got cool sunglasses!

215
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,754
What? You can tell?

216
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,489
They were really expensive, actually.

217
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,291
So what do we do?

218
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,926
Can I touch your butt?

219
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,829
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

220
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,831
I mean it, totally kidding.

221
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,701
I'd rather knead dough
than grab your flat butt.

222
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,235
Yeah right, Gin.

223
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,937
You're so excited
your nose is bleeding.

224
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,172
She's incredible.

225
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,441
She already forgot what happened
three seconds ago.

226
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,443
Oh, you're just so funny!

227
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,345
Would you like some champagne?

228
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,281
We have Dom Perignon, the finest
and most expensive champagne.

229
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,516
Dom Perignon, Dom Perignon,
and Dom Perignon as well!

230
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,285
I'll have a scotch and water.

231
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,720
You got it, Gin.

232
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,555
A Dom Perignon, please!

233
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,690
Somebody, call an interpreter!

234
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,793
Dom Perignon brings back memories
of when I worked for the government.

235
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,129
I often had Dom whenever I met
with my business partners.

236
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,298
It's too expensive to pay out
of my own pocket, though.

237
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,367
We'll be fine with
something cheaper, like beer.

238
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,434
Let's see.

239
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,570
Uh, Dom Perignon.

240
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,605
Dom Perignon mixed
with Dom Perignon.

241
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,574
Beer but actually Dom Perignon,
The Big Dom,

242
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,843
Nothing but Dom Perignon,
Dom Perignon after all,

243
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,311
Just Say Dom Perignon.

244
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,146
Wait, what was Dom Perignon?

245
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,614
I'm starting to get confused.

246
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,050
Dom Peri... Dom Pe...
Dom Peri...

247
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,253
‐It's all Dom Perignon!
‐It's all Dom Perignon!

248
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,655
They're ripping us off.

249
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,689
No doubt about it.

250
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:10,957
This is a rip‐off joint!

251
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:11,658
That's ridiculous.

252
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,159
Otae wouldn't do
a thing like that.

253
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,029
Then what's a Dom Perignon
mixed with Dom Perignon?

254
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,198
My feelings are all mixed up in the sea of
Dom Perignon.

255
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,667
Gin, Sweetie...

256
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,370
you haven't bought me
Dom Perignon in quite a while.

257
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,172
Dom? Are you talking
about yourself?

258
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,075
I've never gotten you any Dom Perignon,
ever!

259
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,011
Mr. Hasegawa, I think your sunglasses,
and your sunglasses,

260
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,581
and your sunglasses would
perignon so well with Dom Perignon!

261
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,616
Perignon?!
What are you saying?

262
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,886
Are my sunglasses the only thing
you can complement me on?!

263
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,054
Oh, please, Dom...

264
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,256
‐I want to drink Perignon.
‐All right, Dom?

265
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,457
Okay, Perignon?

266
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,625
‐Dom‐Perignon! Dom‐Perignon!
‐Hey, hey, hey.

267
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,728
Put it together and
it's just Dom Perignon!

268
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:51,531
It's subliminal, like a subliminal
advertising!

269
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,299
They're manipulating
our subconscious minds.

270
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,968
Cover your ears, don't
let them get into you!

271
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,805
Excuse me. Five bottles
of Dom Perignon, please.

272
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,945
‐Big Papa! Big Papa!
‐Big Papa! Big Papa!

273
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:06,879
Big Papa!

274
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,982
I'm so happy
you actually came at last!

275
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,617
I'm so sorry.

276
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,386
You were busy at work, right?

277
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,455
It's all right. I was just
at some boring meeting.

278
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,790
It's not like Edo City's going
to be destroyed or anything.

279
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,660
But if I can't come here,
Big Papa will be destroyed.

280
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,895
Oh, you make me so happy!

281
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:26,165
‐That's Big Papa Matsudaira!
‐Oh, really?

282
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,000
Otae, that man is famous for

283
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,470
the outrageously extravagant
way he parties.

284
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,371
Hey, Big Papa!

285
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,641
I haven't had Dom Perignon
in quite a while.

286
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,510
‐Can I have some?
‐Oh, Ané!

287
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,312
That stuff's just like juice.

288
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:42,014
Big Papa would like
to drink something stronger,

289
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,616
but... ah, well, you know...

290
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,519
Five bottles of Dom Perignon
coming right up!

291
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,356
I'll serve it right away.

292
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:51,891
What a waste!

293
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,025
It's spilling all over.

294
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,861
Thousands right down the drain!

295
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,496
‐Cheers!
‐Cheers!

296
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,803
‐Dom Perignon, Dom Perignon!
‐Dom Perignon, Dom Perignon!

297
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,573
‐Dom Perignon, Dom Perignon!
‐‐Dom Perignon, Dom Perignon!

298
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,310
‐Big Papa! Big Papa!
‐Big Papa! Big Papa!

299
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,279
Big Papa, you're the best!

300
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,814
My gosh, five bottles at once.

301
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,783
There's no way
you can win against that.

302
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,051
What's that?
You want to beat him?

303
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,586
Don't you worry, it's easy!

304
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,655
We can mix 80% water
and 20% scotch,

305
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,524
and still get more
drunk than him.

306
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,259
That's not what
this battle is about.

307
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,861
Nobody wants to win
such a sad victory.

308
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,931
<i>See the difference</i>
<i>between you and me?</i>

309
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,001
<i>Your loser customer</i>
<i>is no match for Big Papa!</i>

310
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,437
Otae, what will you do?

311
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,472
At this rate...

312
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,074
Are you just gonna let her
act like a queen?

313
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,045
Hey, hey, you guys,
what's with the glum faces?

314
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,129
Bring 10 bottles
of Dom Perignon right away.

315
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,864
Mr. Kondo!

316
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:08,334
We have an order
for 10 Dom Perignons!

317
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,870
Wow! Awesome!

318
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,710
Good work, girls!

319
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,146
Amazing!

320
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,583
‐Otae jumped ahead of Ané all at once!
‐What?!

321
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,721
I heard about what's going on
from the hostesses.

322
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,457
Otae, you could've just come to me.

323
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,694
You know I've been saving up
money in our joint bank account

324
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,863
for when we get married someday.

325
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,667
So, you can relax now.

326
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,904
I may not look it,
but I've made quite a lot.

327
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,539
Oh, Mr. Gorilla.

328
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,908
Don't... don't call me Gorilla,

329
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,810
especially when I came
to save you!

330
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,180
‐Okay, Mr. Gorilla.
‐It's the same thing!

331
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,615
Kondo!

332
00:16:55,615 --> 00:17:00,419
You're about 100 years too early to
try and outshine me in Kabukicho!

333
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,154
Shut up, you perverted old man!

334
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,891
From tonight on,
I am the King of Nightlife!

335
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,325
Don't be ridiculous!

336
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,362
I won't allow even the Shogun
to take away what I live for!

337
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,631
15 bottles of Dom Perignon!

338
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,533
Yeah! You're so cool,
Big Papa!

339
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,769
Otae, Dom Perignon
over here too.

340
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,572
Excuse me, another round
of Dom Perignon with this.

341
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:22,742
You mean you already ordered?

342
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,010
That's my wallet!

343
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,112
Aren't you going to mention
how cool I am or something?

344
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,249
No, you're a really cool guy.

345
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,984
We all know that, of course.

346
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,489
It's not easy to spend that
much money on a girl, Gorilla!

347
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,324
You're one heck of a guerilla!

348
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:41,093
All you did was change
the spelling of the word!

349
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,261
And why are you guys
drinking that?

350
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,230
Those are for the hostesses?

351
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:47,500
‐Don't worry about the details!
‐Of course I will!

352
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,970
‐More Dom Perignon here!
‐Don't!

353
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,608
This is the highest record!

354
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,411
Another round of Dom Perignon!

355
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,246
Another round of Dom Perignon!

356
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,847
Keep the Dom Perignon coming!

357
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,849
More and more Dom Perignon!

358
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,585
They're neck to neck!

359
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:07,720
Drink up!

360
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,789
Bottom's up!

361
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:16,329
Boy, you put up
a pretty good fight, Kondo,

362
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,365
but isn't your wallet starting
to be a little malnutritioned?

363
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,600
Don't underestimate me.

364
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,103
I withdrew my entire
marriage savings.

365
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,273
There's nothing left.
What's going on?

366
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,410
You never ordered Dom
Perignon in your life

367
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,113
so you didn't know that
it's seriously expensive!

368
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,183
Like really expensive!

369
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,653
A few dozen glasses of it
can wipe out all your savings!

370
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,055
"Oh, what did I do?

371
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,423
My wife's gonna kill me!"

372
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,525
So you're in big trouble, too!

373
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,328
Uh... oh, Otae, look.

374
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,098
Mr. Kondo, that's enough.

375
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,133
What you've done
is quite enough.

376
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,035
But Otae...

377
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,439
Now all you have to do is
sell this and that'll be enough.

378
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,243
Um... sell that?

379
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,813
But, that's a Samurai's soul,
just so you know.

380
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,948
Soul? Come on.

381
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,950
Why don't you just go
and buy a new one?

382
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,085
‐I don't think it works like that.
‐Come on!

383
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,920
Let me see you throw in
some big money!

384
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,355
She's right, go all in!

385
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,391
If you need a sword,
buy it at a pawn shop!

386
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,359
I bought mine
from a shopping channel!

387
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,694
What, no way?

388
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,230
You told me you got it
from a hermit or something!

389
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,498
Well, I lied!

390
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,599
That's an awful lie!

391
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,933
I went to the main store,

392
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,803
and pondered and pondered
whether to buy these beauties.

393
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,738
You go and sell your sunglasses.

394
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,941
I said, go sell your sunglasses.

395
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,310
And buy me a drink!

396
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,547
They're expensive, right?

397
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,381
Now go!

398
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,352
That's what you get
for trying to act cool

399
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,421
when you're totally dirt broke!

400
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:49,822
Look at me!

401
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:53,626
I live simply, so then
I've got nothing to lose.

402
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,027
You go borrow money.

403
00:19:55,895 --> 00:20:00,766
I said, if you guys don't have
any money, go borrow some!

404
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,544
That's why I said
you punks are 100 years

405
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,245
too young to be playing at night.

406
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,749
Kids who don't know when
to quit can't survive in this town.

407
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:21,787
Oh, my wallet's empty,
so Ané, the bill, please.

408
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,556
What are you talking about?

409
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:27,426
Your wallet may be empty,
but your bank account isn't, is it?

410
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,161
Go get some more cash...

411
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,597
or I'll tell your wife everything.

412
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,299
Wow!

413
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,743
Wow, wow, wow, wow!
Lord, huh?

414
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,445
You were both fantastic!

415
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,514
Ané, Otae, I have to say

416
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:51,250
you both win the competition
this time around!

417
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,522
That was a great match.

418
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,357
It's you and me Ané.

419
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,426
Let's go out there
and kill it again.

420
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,336
<i>Hey, what's with the cheesy</i>
<i>poem type thing over our heads?</i>

421
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,238
<i>Don't try to brush it off like that!</i>

422
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,241
<i>That's doesn't settle anything at all!</i>

423
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,336
<i>Holy crap. One hell of</i>
<i>a freak show's moved in!</i>

424
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,171
<i>My next door neighbor Hedro?</i>

425
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,373
He looks scary!

426
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:28,907
<i>He said he's a florist by day,</i>

427
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,510
<i>but he has to be plotting</i>
<i>world domination by night!</i>

428
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,145
<i>The next episode...</i>
