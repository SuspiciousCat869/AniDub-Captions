1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,269
Happy New Year...

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:04,504
and please keep watching
the show!

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:05,405
Whoa!

4
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:36,830
<i>What happened?</i>

5
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,598
<i>The sky is all white...</i>

6
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,104
<i>I'm the one all white, but why....</i>

7
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,008
<i>Why am I sleeping...</i>

8
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,943
<i>in a strange place like this?</i>

9
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,613
<i>Has something like this</i>
<i>happened before?</i>

10
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:01,922
<i>We might be having...</i>

11
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,491
<i>abnormal weather this winter or</i>
<i>something...</i>

12
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,326
But when raindrops fall...

13
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,528
you wash yourself
in an outdoor tub!

14
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,131
And when spears fall,
you'd do a bamboo dance,

15
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,033
you have fun no matter
what the situation...

16
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,368
That's the Edo spirit!

17
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,569
On that note...

18
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,039
let the First Wacky Kabukicho
Snow Festival begin!

19
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,441
Look, Gin!

20
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,043
I brought you some snow.

21
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,611
Oh, leave it right there.

22
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,748
Wow, everyone is making
great sculptures.

23
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,816
They're all pretty naughty looking,
though.

24
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,518
I guess that's Kabukicho, for you...

25
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,187
As for the Odd Jobs team,
we are...

26
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,822
Well, this looks very good...

27
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,824
Now I just have to erect
the rod in between them...

28
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:38,658
Whoa!

29
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,193
Our show is gonna
end right now!

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,328
Hey, hey...

31
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,662
what are you doing, huh?

32
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,197
I can't believe you just did that?

33
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,933
Do you know how hard I worked
to make that left ball?

34
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,368
Speak for yourself!

35
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,836
Don't you know how much
trouble the producer

36
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,605
will have to go through if
you do something like that?

37
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,540
Hey, Gin, I finished the rod.

38
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,843
What are you holding,
Kagura, oh no?!

39
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,679
Shinpachi, what's the big fuss?

40
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,914
I don't know what you think
this is, but look...

41
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,082
we are building...

42
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:06,186
the Neo Armstrong Cyclone
Jet Armstrong Cannon.

43
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,888
You said Armstrong twice!

44
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,724
There's no way such an
erotic cannon exists!

45
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,025
Damn teenagers!

46
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,627
They're mind is filled
with dirty thoughts...

47
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,796
Whenever you hear "rod" or
"balls" you immediately assume

48
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,130
we're talking about something dirty.

49
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,865
Yeah, you're really disgusting.

50
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,767
Don't talk to me for a while, okay?

51
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,269
Then, what is it, huh?

52
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,770
Oh, what do you know?

53
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,138
You guys are here, too?

54
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,540
Oh, Hasegawa.

55
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,442
Please stop these guys.

56
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,310
Those two are making
something filthy...

57
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:31,912
Hey, isn't that...

58
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,749
a Neo Armstrong Cyclone
Jet Armstrong Cannon?

59
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,717
Wow, it looks so authentic!

60
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,252
How do you know what that is?!

61
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,353
Does it really exist?

62
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,189
Seriously? Am I the only one
who doesn't know anything?!

63
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,591
It was the Dog Star System's
ultimate weapon.

64
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,994
They used it to blow up Edo Castle Tower
and force Japan to surrender.

65
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,196
What?

66
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,832
Our country lost because of
this stupid looking cannon?

67
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,935
So, Hasegawa,
what are you doing here?

68
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,604
Well, I've created my own
sculpture for the contest...

69
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,073
I heard the winner gets
a big cash prize.

70
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,209
Wow!

71
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,710
It looks so amazing.

72
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,379
I have no idea what it is,
but it looks amazing!

73
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,614
Well, yeah...

74
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,082
it's nothing really.

75
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,320
I tend to put in a lot of effort when
making something, so I couldn't stop...

76
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,921
I call it "Flight."

77
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,357
Wow, it's really fantastic!

78
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,359
Are you the model for this,
Hasegawa?

79
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:22,562
Huh, Well, I put my heart
and soul into it,

80
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,830
so it ended up looking like me.

81
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,566
This statue is too muscular
to be you.

82
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,268
Let me scrape some
off around here.

83
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,169
Hey!

84
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,403
What are you doing?

85
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,471
Give me a break!

86
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,607
This thing's actually really
delicately balanced!

87
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,708
Oh?

88
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,544
So then it even
resembles your life.

89
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,846
I wonder if that part looks
like dork's too.

90
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,549
No! Stop pointing your finger at that!

91
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,218
Hey, hey, don't show our
Kagura a dirty thing like that!!

92
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,620
Hold on!

93
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,755
You see things like this in
museums all the time!

94
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,290
I mean, it's not dirty, it's art!

95
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,158
Bastard!

96
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,093
Are you trying to get this
show cancelled?

97
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:54,661
Hey!

98
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,329
Watch where you're throwing
that snowball!

99
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,064
Hey!
Take that!

100
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,633
Whoa!

101
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,635
My Dandy Outstanding Refined Knob.

102
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:02,936
In short, my Dork!

103
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,641
‐It got stuck!
‐It got stuck!

104
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,242
Hey!

105
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,379
How could you stick that dirty
thing onto our masterpiece?!

106
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,413
They're coming!

107
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,182
Do something, Shinpachi!

108
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,563
This is really great work.

109
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,031
Oh, really?

110
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:31,998
Hey, you guys!

111
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,567
You two are really so mean!

112
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,734
I bet you did that on purpose.

113
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,436
No, I didn't mean it.

114
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,604
But if we left it as it was,
I'm sure

115
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,506
we would have got angry
calls from the PTA.

116
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,375
That thing you're making is
barely safe, you know.

117
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,711
Hey, I just came up
with a great idea.

118
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,012
Let's add some wings.

119
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:46,813
Some wings.

120
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,648
Yeah, Gin, that sounds great!

121
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,650
How did you come up
with such a great idea?

122
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,286
Well, I don't know, but it
suddenly just came to me.

123
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,488
Oh?
You guys are here, too?

124
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,623
Katsura.

125
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:01,895
I suppose this is the Neo Armstrong
Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon...

126
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:03,763
It looks so authentic!

127
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,398
Why does everyone know
what this is?

128
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,734
Another name for it is
"Running Thunder."

129
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,302
It is a deadly weapon that caused

130
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,105
"The Seven Days of Flames"
during the Balkans Campaign.

131
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,241
That's not the story that
I heard earlier...

132
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,710
So what are you
doing here, huh?

133
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,012
I'm participating in this
contest just for fun.

134
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:20,347
Wow!

135
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,414
That's amazing!

136
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,083
It's like an amusement
park attraction!

137
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,753
You know, events like this should
be fun for children, as well...

138
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,389
You are welcome to play on it,
if you want to...

139
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,026
Hey, that's not the right way
to play on it.

140
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,095
So this is kinda like
for rock climbing?

141
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,062
No way!

142
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,964
This is a slide, Kagura!

143
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,799
Zoom!
Don't slide with those on!

144
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,571
Hey, Cobra, where are
the stairs on this?

145
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,207
Why do you guys have to obsess
over rock climbing?

146
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:50,343
Besides, I can see you used the
stairs half way up, you idiot!

147
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,246
Geez, the slide is all
scratched up now.

148
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,448
I'll have to smooth it
out with my spit.

149
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,618
You bastards!

150
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,321
I know what you're up to,
you're trying to ruin my work

151
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,989
so that you can win
the grand prize!

152
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,591
I won't let you win that easy!

153
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,345
Hey, isn't it amazing?

154
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,180
You must really be a genius.

155
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,949
How did you come up with
attaching a slide to this?

156
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,785
I don't know, but it just
came to me,

157
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,953
like I was suddenly hit
with some expiration.

158
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,322
You mean, inspiration.

159
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,089
Oh, hi.

160
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,457
Gintoki, hello there.

161
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,625
What a surprise...

162
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,827
I swear I had no idea
that you were here...

163
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,330
It's not like I was following
you or anything.

164
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,264
It's just that...

165
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:45,965
Nobody even asked you if...

166
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,103
This is a Neo Armstrong Cyclone
Jet Armstrong Cannon.

167
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,671
It really looks so authentic!

168
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,507
How can you even tell, it doesn't
look like a cannon anymore!

169
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,644
During the interstellar war,
between the planets Tom and Jeromy,

170
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,614
unlike the "Method Cannon" that
ultimately led the Jeromy's to victory,

171
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,883
this cursed weapon
was put in a storehouse,

172
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:04,818
and abandoned for ages.

173
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:05,752
Whatever!

174
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,087
That's such a long story!

175
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:08,488
So are you...

176
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,156
making a snow sculpture, too?

177
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,559
Well, yes, I am,
but it's nothing really...

178
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,361
Oh, seriously?

179
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,463
I see something over there
that could obviously

180
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:17,797
only have been made by you.

181
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,332
Don't get me wrong.

182
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,734
That‐That's not Gin at all.

183
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,635
Um... It is fictitious,

184
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,338
and any resemblance to real
persons is purely coincidental!

185
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,507
Yeah, its legs are far too long.

186
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,576
Gin's are much shorter than those.

187
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,678
It's a reflection of her fantasy.

188
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,346
Well, that's about right...

189
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,882
Wow, it really looks
exactly like me...

190
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,550
I bet this will win
the grand prize...

191
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,853
I can't possibly destroy
this snow statue.

192
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,054
What's that?

193
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,389
Really, are you complimenting me?

194
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,058
I'm just saying what I am thinking
out loud, nothing more.

195
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,494
Why are his arms all stretched
out like that?

196
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:48,828
Oh, well that...

197
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,630
is for this!

198
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,532
And now it's compleee...

199
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,100
Impossible!

200
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,235
What are you doing?

201
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,536
Gin's arms are broken!

202
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,871
Fix them quickly!

203
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,072
I'm so sorry!

204
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,673
Oh, my glasses, my glasses...

205
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,275
I'll put them right back on!

206
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,246
Hello there...

207
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,983
‐What're you doing, you dirty old geezer!
‐Oh, why me?

208
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,619
How strange.

209
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,854
I thought that you really
were touching me, Gin.

210
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,222
I'm so sorry.

211
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,924
Hello, Sis, what are you doing here?

212
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,025
Well...

213
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,461
the bar I work at is participating
in the competition.

214
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,529
Oh?

215
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,198
It's the Neo Armstrong Cyclone
Jet Armstrong Cannon.

216
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,533
It looks so authentic!

217
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,534
That's enough!

218
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,235
It obviously looks nothing like it!

219
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,236
It looks so stupid.

220
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,738
What a pitiful Armstrong, right?

221
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,972
What are you talking about?

222
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,207
What is this Armstrong Cannon?!

223
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,810
Anyway, do you want to come
and see our sculpture, Shin?

224
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,312
We all worked incredibly
hard on it...

225
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,650
See?
Isn't it great?

226
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,219
So tell me...

227
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,821
what did the Odd Jobs
team make?

228
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,656
Oh, well...

229
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,326
I'm too embarrassed...

230
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,028
to say what we're making, I mean,

231
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,096
what the hell is a
Neo Armstrong Cyclone

232
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,531
Jet Armstrong Cannon, anyway?

233
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,800
It's just some porny thing, come on.

234
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,002
Ah.
The truth at last.

235
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,704
There's no way we'd
win the grand prize,

236
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,272
or even a prize for participating.

237
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,375
Let's go home, before we publicly
humiliate ourselves.

238
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,444
Where are you two going?

239
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,880
Don't you want to stay just
to enjoy our snow statue?

240
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,017
What's that?

241
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,986
There's something weird
on the snow statue!

242
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,089
Who cares about the grand prize!

243
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,292
I've decided, that if I can't win this
contest, then nobody can win it!

244
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,396
And besides, all these statues
are gonna melt, anyway...

245
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,499
Into oblivion!

246
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,068
It's a pervert!!

247
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,135
Help us!!

248
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,804
All our efforts are futile!

249
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,840
Even if we made a new slide,
they'd simply destroy it again!

250
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,010
I don't want the slide anymore, anyway!

251
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,779
I wish all the slides in the
world would just collapse!

252
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,182
Oh, my!

253
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,750
Everybody is fighting now!

254
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,051
What a total mess!

255
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,653
What should we do, Otae?

256
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,222
We'd better give up on winning,
don't you think?

257
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,424
Otae?

258
00:10:58,725 --> 00:10:59,959
Hey, what are you doing?

259
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,761
Who do you think you're kidding?

260
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,297
There's no way I'm giving
up on this grand prize!

261
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,901
We promised to share the 100 cups
of Bargain‐Dash ice cream,

262
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,302
and I'm going to win!

263
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,207
Bargain‐Dash?

264
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,142
The winner gets 100 cups
of ice cream?

265
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,744
Hey, you've got to be kidding me.

266
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,313
I worked so hard, and
on a very cold day...

267
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,348
because I heard there would
be a cash prize

268
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,151
for the winner of the contest,
I can't believe this...

269
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,519
Damn you...

270
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,455
you rotten granny,
you tricked me!

271
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,558
How dare you treat
us like fools!

272
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,366
Hey, Otose...

273
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,734
what were...

274
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,703
we doing again here again?

275
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,073
Is this a snowball
fight competition?

276
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,277
Nope...

277
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,346
It's a festival.

278
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,229
Hey, you see that?!

279
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,265
You see that,
I made those fireworks!!

280
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,300
You know, it's a little bit lopsided...

281
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,704
Oh, quit nitpicking
all the small things.

282
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,407
<i>Fireworks sparkling</i>
<i>in the summer sky.</i>

283
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,543
<i>Like a flower...</i>

284
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,379
<i>that blooms for a small</i>
<i>moment in time...</i>

285
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,282
<i>and then fades away...</i>

286
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,516
<i>just like us...</i>

287
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,851
<i>human beings.</i>

288
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,390
Uh...
Uhh...

289
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,992
What is this?

290
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,994
This just looks like a snail
to me no matter what.

291
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,629
Is this some kind of harassment?

292
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,063
This has to be that...

293
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,065
escargot thing we hear
legends about.

294
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,233
It's really expensive..

295
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,267
Is it really?

296
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,236
Hey, listen, this job
might pay really well!

297
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,305
After all, we haven't
even met them yet...

298
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,574
and they're treating us
to this kind of food!

299
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,143
Don't get so excited,
you simpleton!

300
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,479
We'll be laughing stocks
if we eat this!

301
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,048
They're testing our manners,
I mean look at the butler.

302
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,317
Right, he's smirking at us,
isn't he?

303
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,087
You're right...

304
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:08,788
What?

305
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,423
But, then what are we
supposed to do with...

306
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,557
this snail?

307
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,426
It's obviously a plate!

308
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,828
We put food on top of it
and then we eat it...

309
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,563
A plate?

310
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,632
But it's already on a plate!

311
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,568
Yeah, but coffee cups
come on plates, don't, hey?

312
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,804
It's more classy that
way or something.

313
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,973
You two are both real hicks.

314
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,474
Watch how I use it...

315
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,510
Excuse me!

316
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,278
More water, please.

317
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,346
Now, I see...

318
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,214
We use it to summon the butler.

319
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,816
That's why it's disk‐shaped.

320
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:37,650
Hey, butler!

321
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,018
Can I have some chopsticks, please?

322
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,687
Hey, Gin, I don't think that's
how you use escargot.

323
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:41,854
Yes, it is.

324
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:42,822
Because he stopped smirking.

325
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,856
Wait?
Is he crying?

326
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,328
Who's that guy?

327
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,164
What?
A snail fairy?

328
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,533
Look, he's got a snail on his head.

329
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,635
Do you think...

330
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,370
that's what we're supposed
to do with this?

331
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,306
I'm so sorry I'm late,
Mr. Odd Jobs.

332
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,408
My mother is sick and I...

333
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,912
What in the world are you
guys all doing?!

334
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:08,715
I'm sorry.

335
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,350
You see, we're not exactly
used to this kind of thing...

336
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,220
That's quite all right.

337
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,323
I'm just glad to see you've gotten
acquainted with my father already

338
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,125
and are getting along properly.

339
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,460
Your father?

340
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,562
Yes, believe or not...

341
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,263
That's actually my father...

342
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,599
You see, I called you over here today...

343
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:29,102
to ask you if you would
take care of him for me.

344
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,503
You old escargot fart!

345
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,904
That's my...

346
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,240
Who are you calling
escalator or cart?!

347
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,076
I'm so sorry...

348
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,778
but you see, my father...

349
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,680
hasn't exactly been himself lately...

350
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,516
<i>He used to be a master of fireworks..</i>

351
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:47,453
<i>the greatest pyrotechnician in the</i>
<i>Capital and built up our household...</i>

352
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:50,556
<i>But ever since he retired to</i>
<i>take care of my ill mother,</i>

353
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,825
his dementia has really set in.

354
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,894
Flute Sky Walker, look at you.

355
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,263
You're very hairy today, aren't you?

356
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,333
Hoot Slime Walker is cute.

357
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,567
That's a cute name.

358
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,136
‐No, no, he's Shoot Shit‐Stalker...
<i>‐He often wanders around</i>

359
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:06,139
<i>in the middle of the night,</i>
<i>and sometimes disappears for days.</i>

360
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,174
<i>‐He's getting to be a handful...</i>
‐Hoot Shit Lover is a pretty name.

361
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,108
Right, right.

362
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,010
But it's really Michael J. Dogs.

363
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,845
They seem to be getting along.

364
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,881
Though their conversation
is completely incoherent...

365
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,583
Men sure are delicate, aren't they?

366
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,786
Women are able to live their lives...

367
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,522
fairly well even after
their husbands die...

368
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,524
But when the wife dies first...

369
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,093
men start shriveling up and
they can't survive on their own,

370
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,795
and It's a pitiful sight.

371
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,197
Excuse me, but his wife
isn't dead yet...

372
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,033
<i>She fell ill three years ago...</i>

373
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,968
<i>and has been bedridden</i>
<i>ever since...</i>

374
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,037
<i>He stopped making fireworks...</i>

375
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,639
<i>in order to take care of her...</i>

376
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,908
<i>and now he's like this...</i>

377
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,811
He must have really
loved his fireworks...

378
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,147
It makes me feel sorry for the
old man when I think about...

379
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,550
You old fart!
What are you doing?!

380
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,220
He said he's going to
meet his mistress.

381
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,689
As if that exists!
He's just trying to run away!

382
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:57,723
Get down now!

383
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:58,758
What?

384
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,092
‐Stand aside!
‐What?

385
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,297
There!

386
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,337
We can't take our eyes off
of him for one second...

387
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,405
Hey, Gin...

388
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,840
wasn't that a bit too much?

389
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,075
You realize we're supposed
to take care of him...

390
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,677
not take his life from him, right?

391
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,111
Yahoooo!

392
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,981
Whoa!
He hasn't given up yet!

393
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,815
What?

394
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,619
Why is he so energetic?

395
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,020
Is he really an old man?

396
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,093
Hey, guys!

397
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,062
You're destroying
the entire house!

398
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,633
‐There!
‐There!

399
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,136
Oh.

400
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,710
Father, I'm sick of your
ridiculous behavior!

401
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,745
Don't you realize
how sick mother is?

402
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,147
There are some things that
are just not okay to do!

403
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,182
I'm sorry.

404
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,184
I'm afraid we got
carried away, too.

405
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,052
No, don't you worry about it.

406
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,988
You guys did your very best!

407
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,056
Why are you talking, you old fart!

408
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,691
Listen, Father, but...

409
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,928
the doctor said mother will have
to be hospitalized...

410
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,730
She's gotten a lot worse.

411
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,633
We simply can't take care
of her at home anymore.

412
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,202
But so then he's going
to be separated...

413
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,937
from his wife then?

414
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,472
Father...

415
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,742
Don't you have anything
to say concerning this?

416
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,212
I'm going to see my mistress.

417
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,214
‐Oh.
‐Oh.

418
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,384
This is just awful...

419
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,220
I wonder if he even
remembers my mother at all.

420
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,656
Please excuse me.

421
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,292
No, please don't go...

422
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,729
Please don't go after him,
and just let him be,

423
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,565
I'm the one who made
him that way...

424
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:49,335
I'm the one that took away his
beloved fireworks from him...

425
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,003
So please...

426
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,905
Just let him be free...

427
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,244
<i>He's done more than enough</i>
<i>for me when I became ill...</i>

428
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,381
<i>He gave up his entire career</i>
<i>that he loved so much</i>

429
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,151
<i>and did everything he could</i>
<i>to take care of me...</i>

430
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,686
<i>But...</i>

431
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,988
<i>I can't stand to see him</i>
<i>so miserable</i>

432
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,757
<i>because he can't do what</i>
<i>he loves to do anymore...</i>

433
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:16,462
<i>I want him to forget about me</i>
<i>and return to his love...</i>

434
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,633
<i>His mind was always filled with</i>
<i>his love for his fireworks,</i>

435
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,435
<i>ever since the day I met him...</i>

436
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:25,504
<i>There</i> <i>was</i> <i>no</i> <i>place</i> <i>for</i> <i>me</i> <i>in</i>
<i>his</i> <i>heart</i> <i>from</i> <i>the</i> <i>very beginning...</i>

437
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,576
<i>But</i> <i>that</i> <i>is</i> <i>the</i> <i>man</i> <i>that</i>
<i>I</i> <i>fell</i> <i>in</i> <i>love</i> <i>with.</i>

438
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,645
Oh, Mother...

439
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:47,893
Hey, so...

440
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,862
this is the place where
he hides his lover.

441
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,664
That's right...

442
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,067
And she's quite a beauty,
as well.

443
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:58,304
Please be a gentleman and
not disturb them, Mr. Sakata.

444
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,440
You're the butler...

445
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,977
So tell me, exactly what
are you doing here?

446
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,148
Whoa!

447
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,183
The old man's been really
pent‐up hasn't he!

448
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,251
What kind of fetish is that?

449
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,438
I did good...

450
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,608
There we go...

451
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,178
Fireworks, huh...

452
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,579
Just as I thought...

453
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,416
How long have you known
about this, Mr. Butler?

454
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:44,617
For..

455
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,085
quite a long time now...

456
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,722
I heard that he leaves the house
for a couple of days at a time

457
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,323
but it was to come here, huh?

458
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,958
What a man he is!

459
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,493
He forgets most things...

460
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,095
but not his fireworks, huh?

461
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,200
Fireworks are his entire life.

462
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,935
They are a part of his soul...

463
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,840
Even as his memory fades,
his great skills never will.

464
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,842
I feel bad for his wife in saying this,

465
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:13,379
but Master is an artisan before
he is a husband or a father...

466
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,449
I beg you, as a favor,
please leave him alone,

467
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,351
and let him die as the
great craftsman that he is.

468
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,053
He's forgotten everything...

469
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,589
including his very
own wife and all.

470
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,826
But the skills that are
hardwired into his body...

471
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:28,727
they'll never disappear, huh?

472
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,630
What a sad story that is, but I think.

473
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,333
I think humans are far
better than that...

474
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,036
Even if your memories
flee from your noggin...

475
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,406
the memories that are ingrained
deep within your heart,

476
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,675
within your soul,
they never disappear...

477
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,579
<i>And that's what I'd like to believe.</i>

478
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:50,783
Hey!

479
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,985
Are you watching?

480
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,820
Oh, just shut up!
Yes, I'm watching...

481
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,657
God, why do I have to watch
fireworks on such a cold day?!

482
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,293
Fireworks in winter are
something very special!

483
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,862
I've told you that before.

484
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,432
Keep your eyes propped
wide open, all right?

485
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,035
You say you've developed
some new techniques but...

486
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:13,105
why do I have to come and
watch your test fireworks?

487
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,983
<i>I'm sure that he was trying</i>
<i>to say "Marry me,"</i>

488
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,553
<i>but he misspelled and it said</i>
<i>"Carry me" instead.</i>

489
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,289
My goodness!

490
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,325
Father hasn't changed at all,
not a single bit.

491
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,127
It's as you say...

492
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,328
You're not cold are you, Mother?

493
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,897
I'm alright...

494
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,198
<i>Yes...</i>

495
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,368
<i>that was fifty eight</i>
<i>years ago today and...</i>

496
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,470
<i>I</i> <i>wonder</i> <i>if</i> <i>he</i>
<i>still</i> <i>remembers...</i>

497
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,138
<i>No...</i>

498
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,907
<i>There's</i> <i>no</i> <i>way</i> <i>he</i>
<i>would</i> <i>remember...</i>

499
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:49,708
<i>Matsu!</i>

500
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,546
<i>Every year on this date,</i>
<i>I'll light up the sky for you!</i>

501
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,082
<i>He's such a liar.</i>

502
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,618
<i>That was the very first</i>
<i>and very last time</i>

503
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,854
<i>he ever made fireworks for me.</i>

504
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,356
<i>Matsu, you once said to me...</i>

505
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:09,428
<i>that both people and fireworks</i>
<i>bloom like beautiful flowers</i>

506
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,431
<i>for just a brief moment</i>
<i>and then they fade away...</i>

507
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,333
<i>That may be true...</i>

508
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,169
<i>But Matsu, even if it's only</i>
<i>for just a brief moment,</i>

509
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,804
<i>I want you to bloom by my side...</i>

510
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,840
<i>And when you fade away,</i>
<i>do so at my side...</i>

511
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,409
<i>and in return...</i>

512
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:28,214
<i>I will make flowers bloom</i>
<i>by your side again and again.</i>

513
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:30,916
Hey, Mother, look!

514
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,184
Look over there!

515
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,220
Fireworks at this time
of the year!

516
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,821
How beautiful they are...

517
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,523
Fireworks in the winter...

518
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,092
sure are something
incredibly special.

519
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,294
Yes indeed...

520
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:47,099
It's a little bit lopsided as always,
but it's beautiful.

521
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,202
Gin!

522
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,070
Look!
Look!

523
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,871
Wow!!
It's amazing!

524
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,907
Was there a firework
festival today?

525
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,250
Hey, are you watching?

526
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,044
<i>My name is Katsura...</i>

527
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:42,214
<i>I travel across the country to visit</i>
