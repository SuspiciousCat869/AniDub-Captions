00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:24,967
Come on, gimme a break!

6
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:26,504
Ah!
He's getting away!

7
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:28,340
This guy's actually running
for his life!

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,476
After him!

Sorry...

16
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:49,784

23
00:01:03,545 --> 00:01:04,647
Hey Shinpachi...

24
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,751
the program just started,
why are you being chased?

25
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:07,953
I don't know!

26
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:10,391
Nobody actually wants
to be chased!

27
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:11,661
Anyway, we should run for it!

28
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:12,963
Stop right there!

29
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:34,305
We've got you now, there's...

30
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:35,107

31
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:36,811

37

<i>Sadaharu Sadaharu, Kagura's pet.</i>

00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:54,379
Geez, would you read the room!

41
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:56,817
I think these guys are
pissed off.

42
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,723
Ka‐Kagura, you'd better get out
of here with us!

43
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:07,371
Hurry up, because I'll have to
walk my neighbor's hamster...

44
00:02:07,873 --> 00:02:11,179
which takes one whole day to
walk around the house!

45
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:14,553
<i>Guys, wait!</i>
<i>Wait for me!</i>

46
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:17,659
<i>Wait!</i>

47
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:22,603
A dead end...

48
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,082
It's the end of the line
for you!

49
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,484
What are you talking about?

50
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,321
Truth is we purposely
let you catch us.

51
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:33,925
Yeah, you should be thankful!

52
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:35,494
What do you mean, you losers?

53
00:02:35,494 --> 00:02:38,066
You should talk, you're the ones
running all over town!

54
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:39,302
Who hired you?

55
00:02:39,302 --> 00:02:42,643
We know that you're the spies
who came to steal our secret!

56
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:45,214
Before we cut you down,
I'll ask you again...

57
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:47,552
Who are you and
what do you want?

58
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:49,823
You ask who we are?

59
00:02:49,823 --> 00:02:52,428
All right then,
since you asked us...

60
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,204
We do anything from housework
to finding missing persons!

61
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:59,977
If you're ever in trouble,
just come to us!

62
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:03,918

66
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,632
You mean to say, you'll do
anything for money?

67
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,301
Now I see.

68
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:15,374
That's why you snuck into our
factory facility and...

69
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,719
There it is!

70
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,821
That must be it!

71
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:23,558
That's the cat

72
00:03:23,558 --> 00:03:25,127
Kuromi of Yamatoya!

73
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:26,329
Come on now, Kitty.

74
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:28,133

Just Wait!

78
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:36,316

for a cat?

<i>Gin Tama.</i>

80
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:08,166
THE PLOT THUS FAR

81
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,107
<i>The land of the samurai...</i>

82
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:14,011
<i>There</i> <i>was</i> <i>a</i> <i>time,</i>

83
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:16,482
<i>when</i> <i>our</i> <i>country</i> <i>was</i> <i>called</i>

84
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,854
<i>But</i> <i>with</i> <i>the</i> <i>arrival</i>
of the "Amanto"

85
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:22,328
<i>or sky people from outer space</i>
<i>and their rise to power,</i>

86
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:25,434
<i>they enacted sword ban</i>
<i>to samurais twenty years ago...</i>

87
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:27,806
<i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>samurai</i> <i>class</i>
<i>fell</i> <i>into</i> <i>decline...</i>

88
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:28,841
<i>In such hard times,</i>

89
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:31,814
<i>there was one man left with</i>
<i>the spirit of the samurai...</i>

90
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:33,818
<i>His name is Gintoki Sakata.</i>

91

<i>by this very same guy.</i>

94
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:42,234

98
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:00,905
<i>Mr. Kariya has just arrived,</i>

99
00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:02,809
I greet you!

100
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,113
‐I greet you!
‐I greet you!

101
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:06,382
I can't hear you!

102
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:07,685
Once again!

103
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:10,457
‐I greet you!
‐I greet you!

104
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:11,527
That's still not enough!

105
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:13,396
Would you care to try it again?

106
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:16,135
No, sir, there's not really
enough time for that.

107
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:17,271
I see...

00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:17,972
KARIYA, SHISHIMURA
SHIMOMOTO, PUU

<i>they're definitely not regulars.</i>

113
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,022
Oh, hello there, Mr. Kariya.

114
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:28,661
And thank you for coming
all this way to see us.

115
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:30,330
Dispense with the intros...

116
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,936
So, how are things going with
that matter we talked about?

117
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:33,336
Fine.

118
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:35,842
Everything is going very well,
Mr Kariya.

119
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:38,179
First, please take a look
at this Powerpoint.

120
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:41,385
The goal of the project.

121
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:44,091
"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls, children of all ages,

122
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:46,329
all these papers aren't
telling me a thing!

123
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:50,303
Is this a presentation for the
spring anime season or what?!

124
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:53,677
Please forgive me, Mr. Kariya.

125
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:06,537
SHINSENGUMI, TOSHIRO HIJIKATA,
SOGO OKITA

126
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:07,539
<i>The Shinsengumi.</i>

132
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,930
Yamazaki, situation report?

133
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,467
They're in a private meeting
in a second floor back room.

134
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,806
There are four of them:
one is an amanto alien,

135
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:25,808
two businessmen,

136
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:28,046
and then there's one
tough‐looking ronin...

137
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,583
That's just perfect...

138
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,818
Let's go!

139
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:32,722
Speaking of the device
we obtained

140
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:34,158
with Mr. Kariya's support...

141
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:36,195
We just finished assembling
the amanto device

142
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:37,599
at our secret factory.

143
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,504
All we need to do now is get it
into position.

144
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:43,510
If this project succeeds,

145
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,915
then all of the capital
will fall under my control.

146
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:48,687
Yes, that is exactly right,
Mr. Kariya.

147
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:55,601
This is a police raid!

148
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:56,703
It's the Shinsengumi!

149
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:58,373
‐Everyone stay still!
‐Okita! Come on!

150
00:07:58,373 --> 00:07:59,441
Okay!

151
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:06,455
Freeze, Shinsengumi!

152
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:12,969
<i>Good‐bye, Vice‐chief.</i>

153
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:15,608
<i>Hope you enjoy sucking on</i>
<i>mayonnaise in the next world.</i>

154
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,555
Hey, Okita, can't you even
recognize who your enemies are?

155
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:25,528
I could kill you at any time
before killing our enemies!

156
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,064
No way, it was a joke.

157
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:28,333
A joke, you know?

158
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,437
Come on, I'm always doing that.

159
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:34,579
Do you mean to say that you're
always trying to kill me?!

160
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:36,482
Anyway, the thing is,
Hijikata.

161
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,522
It seems that all of our efforts
end in failure.

162
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:41,560
Well...

163
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,630
Not really all of our efforts.

164
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:46,469
<i>Odd Jobs Gin.</i>

165
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:52,013
You know, I'm really too old
to be reading comic books

166
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:53,884
like this, but oh well.

167
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:56,322
I just can't quit buying
them every week!

168
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:57,859
That's right, Gintoki.

169
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:00,931
Reading comics like that
won't fill your stomach at all,

170
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:03,504
and your blood‐sugar level
will not get lower.

171
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:06,977
I know, I know, I know, but
I'm seriously addicted to it.

172
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:08,714
I keep thinking that I won't buy
the next one,

173
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,887
‐but then here i am...
‐Gin, we've got a problem here.

174
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:13,557
I know.
It's a problem.

175
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:15,460
Someone my age shouldn't be
reading these.

176
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,801
Yeah, this onigiri's got a
problem too, it's rotten!

177
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,470
That's not what
I'm talking about!

178
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,340
Look at this!
Take a look!

179
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,679
A bank account statement?

180
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,015
You can't fool me.

181
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,720
You know you can't eat
a bank account statement.

182
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,223
We'll have nothing to eat,

183
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:34,364
get anemia and end up turning
like those blue folks in avatar

184
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:38,206
because we have no money left
and I'm feeling blue already!

185
00:09:38,507 --> 00:09:40,143
Calm down, Shinpachi.

186
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:42,013
You're the little punk who
didn't get the comics,

187
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:42,715
aren't you?

188
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,088
The thing is, having no money
is just a chronic condition..

189
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:48,292
like a nasal infection,
know what I mean?

190
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:49,294
So get used to it!

191
00:09:49,294 --> 00:09:51,600
Being poor's nothing new
and it's our destiny.

192
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,508
You've given up already?!

193
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,162
Your life is not on comic,

194
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:54,551
and being poor is not
a chronic condition.

195
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:57,424
Even bread crust would look
like a feast tomorrow for us!

196
00:09:58,826 --> 00:09:59,328
What the...

197
00:09:59,328 --> 00:10:00,063
Nasal infection?

198
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,934
It's an earthquake, moron!

199
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,309
The earthquake just stopped.

200
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:09,148
We're having a lot of
earthquakes lately, so it seems.

201
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:10,016
Yeah.

202
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:11,419
Like when a young boy's
heart trembles

203
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:12,888
when he has to confront
five girls

204
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:14,758
who asked him out
at the same time.

205
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:17,431
Oh, come on!
That would never happen!

206
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:19,936
Yeah but, it does happen
in comic books.

207
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:22,240
A customer?

208
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:23,109
It can't be.

209
00:10:23,109 --> 00:10:25,013
It's probably a door
to door salesman.

210
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:27,384
Shinpachi, if he's from
an insurance company,

211
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:29,923
tell him everybody's
got cancer.

212
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:32,294
And if he asks for donation,
tell him the only papers

213
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:33,763
we've got are comics.

214
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:35,867
Yes!

215
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:39,074
I'm coming!
Sorry we've all got cancer...

216
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:42,781
<i>‐You can't catch me.</i>
<i>‐No, I'm over here.</i>

217
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:45,587
<i>‐Come hurry.</i>
<i>‐Pass it to me.</i>

218
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,393
<i>‐Come on.</i>
<i>‐Oh, no.</i>

219
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:53,269
I came here because I heard that
you guys will take any job,

220
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:55,106
no matter what.

221
00:10:55,106 --> 00:10:56,442
No...

222
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:58,413
Shinpachi, what are you doing?

223
00:10:58,413 --> 00:11:01,185
We gotta go pick up the hamster
in a few minutes!

224
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:03,991
I came because I heard
that this is Odd Jobs Gin.

225
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,593
...frigging...

226
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:06,829
What's wrong?

227
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:08,666
Was it a big mouth politician
promising employment

228
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,868
for 100 billion people?

229
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:12,040
In that case, you could resort
to violence and just rob the...

230
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,776
This is Odd Jobs Gin, right?

231
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:15,313
No way!

232
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:16,782
‐No...
‐...frigging...

233
00:11:16,782 --> 00:11:17,919
...way!

234
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:21,592
Hello?

235
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:22,294
Hello?

236
00:11:22,294 --> 00:11:23,362
Hey, guys.

237
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:24,631
You...

238
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:26,502
no, you can't be...

239
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:27,738
Are you a client?!

240
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:31,712
<i>Ken Kato.</i>

241
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:32,547
<i>Ronin.</i>

242
00:11:32,547 --> 00:11:34,284
<i>Or a jobless samurai.</i>

243
00:11:34,284 --> 00:11:35,921
Let me introduce myself.

244
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:38,326
My name is Ken Kato,
it's nice to meet you.

245
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:40,630
I've been a ronin
for a few days now.

246
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:43,703
Hey, Kagura, what do you
think is going on lately?

247
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,273
We've had clients two days
in row.

248
00:11:45,273 --> 00:11:47,945
Probably cause it's the first
episode, typical storyline.

249
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:51,552
Here's some tea for you...

250
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:53,924
It's hot!

251
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:56,862
You're really in for it
if this is a joke!

252
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:58,566
What's that?
Now you're shocked

253
00:11:58,566 --> 00:11:59,801
and getting uppity?

254
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:02,274
So what can we do for you?

255
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:03,242
Well...

256
00:12:03,242 --> 00:12:04,611
The thing is...

257
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:06,983
I want to get something back
that I lost.

258
00:12:07,284 --> 00:12:10,490
It is something that is very,
very important to me.

259
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:15,300
Well then, what did you lose,
what's this important thing?

260
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,135
Well the truth is...

261
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,873
I need about thirty million yen
to get it back.

262
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:20,009
Listen, Baldy!

263
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:23,349
I told you, you were in for it
if this was a joke, remember?!

264
00:12:23,349 --> 00:12:25,420
What's an easy way
to earn money?

265
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,961
Every time I grab it, it slips
right through my fingers...

266
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:29,996
That's it!

267
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:31,899
Every time you move your hand
on the gambling machine,

268
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:33,002
we go further into the red!

269
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,306
But I heard that you would take
any kinds of jobs

270
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:36,709
for troubled people.

271
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,314
We can't even afford to pay
our rent right now!

272
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:41,619
There's no way we can take care
of someone's business!

273
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:43,289
So leave and don't come
here again!

274
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:45,827
Calm down, both of you,
calm down!..

275
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:49,701
So, now tell me, what would you
do with the money if you had it?

276
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,641
I've been a deadwood
my whole life,

277
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,013
and finally got laid off
last month..

278
00:12:56,282 --> 00:12:59,721
And three weeks ago, I was
swindled out a lot of money

279
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:02,060
and I ended up
losing my house.

280
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:04,559
Then two weeks ago, my wife
and daughter left me,

281
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,165
and they didn't even
leave me a note.

282
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:10,338
And one week ago...

283
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:19,289
Why did you stop talking?!

284
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:20,224
Spit it out!

285
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:21,794
This really sounds like
an anime story!

286
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:23,197
Do things like this befall you
every week?!!

287
00:13:23,197 --> 00:13:25,001
‐Just Finish the story!
‐Tell us what happened

288
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:26,804
to you last week right now!

289
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:28,741
Would you like...

290
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,478
to hear the rest of the story?

291
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:35,788
Why will he tell us the rest
of the story only

292
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:37,525
after we complete the job?

293
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,129
Whatever, the truth is...

294
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:41,366
I'm sure we won't be able
to complete this job.

295
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:44,272
Hey...
So now, where are we going?

296
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:46,043
Well, I'll tell you.

297
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:48,481
The point is that we get the
money as quickly as possible,

298
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:49,416
right?

299
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:51,286
Welcome.

300
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:53,557
Oh, it's just you three guys.

301
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,626
<i>Otose.</i>

302
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:58,767
<i>Proprietor of Hostess Bar Otose</i>
<i>and also Gintoki's landlord.</i>

303
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:02,108
Oh, now I see.

304
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,079
All you guys are such idiots.

305
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,381
If you could make money
that quickly,

306
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:07,385
then there would be no thieves
in the world!

307
00:14:07,552 --> 00:14:08,888
Didn't you ever think
about that?

308
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:10,024
You're so dumb!

309
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:12,061
So says an ex‐thief like you!

310
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:13,097
Yeah, that's right.

311
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:14,633
<i>Catherine...</i>

312
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:16,703
<i>works for Hostess Bar Otose.</i>

313
00:14:16,703 --> 00:14:19,409
<i>She</i> <i>came</i> <i>to</i> <i>Earth</i> <i>as</i>
<i>a</i> <i>migrant</i> <i>worker.</i>

314
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:23,918
Well, there might be one way
to get money...

315
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:26,857
So, what'll it be?

316
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:27,959
Donate your kidney?

317
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,763
Well...
I don't...

318
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:32,502
You've got two of those, so
why don't you sell one of them?

319
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:34,806
You'd sell one kidney
if you were a real man!

320
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:36,577
This isn't gonna work.

321
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,047
So disappointing.

322
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:39,616
You're just a big talker.

323
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:40,918
It's not going to happen

324
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:43,657
if you're not prepared to take
risks, you know that, right?

325
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:46,463
Forget it, that'll be
a crime anyway.

326
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:53,410
Hello, everyone.

327
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,379
What a surprise!

328
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:55,348
<i>Ayame Sarutobi Ayame Sarutobi.</i>

329
00:14:55,348 --> 00:14:56,049
<i>Nickname: Sachan.</i>

330
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:58,120
<i>An elite ninja and a former a</i>
<i>member of the government spy</i>

331
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,191
<i>organization directly</i>
<i>reporting to the Shogun.</i>

332
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:01,126
What?

333
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:04,099
You need a way to get a lot
of money very quickly?

334
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,405
Hey, Sachan, why don't you put
your glasses back on?

335
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:10,144
You gotta face this way, I'm the
one talking to you right now.

336
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:12,248
And I don't care if your
character looks like mine.

337
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:13,717
What are you talking about?

338
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:15,354
I really couldn't care less
about you

339
00:15:15,354 --> 00:15:17,291
or what you think about me.

340
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,462
There's only one I care about.

341
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:23,704
All I care about is...

342
00:15:23,971 --> 00:15:25,174
you, Gin.

343
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,078
Didn't you hear me?

344
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:29,149
I told you it would help to put
on your back glasses!

345
00:15:29,616 --> 00:15:30,451
So...

346
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,522
I take it that the money you
were talking about isn't

347
00:15:32,522 --> 00:15:34,392
to purchase of our little
love nest, then?

348
00:15:35,094 --> 00:15:37,265
What love nest are you
talking about, Sachan?

349
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:39,302
I can't even bear to think
about sitting next to you

350
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:40,337
at the diner.

351
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:43,343
Always so cold to me,
and I'm used to it.

352
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,081
But I don't give up so easily.

353
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:47,518
And why the natto?
The smell's spreading.

354
00:15:47,518 --> 00:15:49,756
Put it away, everyone watching
the show already knows

355
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:51,126
you're extraordinary.

356
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:51,960
Oh, yeah?

357
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,966
Do you think that pushing me
away is going to make me happy?

358
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:56,570
‐Stop blabbering, you idiot,
‐Here we go! That's it!

359
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,273
‐Do something with the natto,
‐Just like that! More!

360
00:15:58,273 --> 00:15:59,876
‐you natto woman!
‐More!

361
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:02,815
That's it!
Just like that!

362
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,951
That's it!

363
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:05,321
Just keep blasting away at me!

364
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:06,690
You're really turning me on!

365
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,592
Just a little more!

366
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,994
You're turning me on!

367
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:11,299
What's this?
It stinks!

368
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:12,235
What's that smell?

369
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:15,207
Smells like natto and
a little touch of masochism.

370
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:18,447
‐Kato.
‐Kato.

371
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:25,027
Well, well, Kato.
How's it going?

372
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:25,995
Well...

373
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:30,971
I bet that was hard on you?!

374
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:32,975
You put your seal on
a bad contract,

375
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:35,648
but you should be more careful
as to what you agree to.

376
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:39,956
That's just too bad, I mean, we
know you're hard up for money.

377
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,593
How did you know that?

378
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:46,102
Anyway, what have you
been doing lately?

379
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:49,442
Well, I'm trying to work hard
and buy my house back...

380
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,146
Buy your house back, Kato?

381
00:16:51,146 --> 00:16:52,615
That'll never happen, man.

382
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:55,087
‐No it won't because...
‐Hey...

383
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:57,491
Well that's right...

384
00:16:57,825 --> 00:17:00,497
Well, let us know, Kato,
when you find a house.

385
00:17:00,664 --> 00:17:03,303
We'll at least send a New Year's
card when you do.

386
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,178
‐Call your folks!
‐Pack your bags!

387
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:08,981
Don't forget to write!

388
00:17:09,315 --> 00:17:10,284
Hey, so you...

389
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:12,088
Yes?

390
00:17:12,088 --> 00:17:13,991
Maybe you should rethink
your request.

391
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:17,598
Let's kill all of them, you know
I'm a professional killer.

392
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:20,237
Yes, let's kill them!
Why don't we roll them up

393
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:22,208
and throw them into
the sewer right now?!

394
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,012
Wait.
I'm changing my request.

395
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,084
But it's not going to be
an assassination.

396
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:28,520
I want...

397
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,457
The thing that
I really want is...

398
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:35,534
I just want..

399
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:37,305
to be stronger!

400
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:40,010
‐Okay, then we got it!
‐Okay, then we got it!

401
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,112
Hey, everyone.

402
00:17:42,214 --> 00:17:44,953
Jack up his hit points
another hundred or so,

403
00:17:44,953 --> 00:17:47,458
and avoid his life
ending up as game over.

404
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:48,721
So, now where
are you going, Gin?

405
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:50,602
I have something
that I need to take care of.

406
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:54,743
That's all I got.

407
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:59,253
Oh, so I see that
this is a blueprint...

408
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:01,858
<i>Isao Kondo Isao Kondo.</i>

409
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:03,261
<i>Commander of the Shinsengumi.</i>

410
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,265
<i>Strikes</i> <i>fear</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>hearts</i>
<i>of</i> <i>others.</i>

411
00:18:05,265 --> 00:18:06,534
By the way, Hijikata...

412
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,408
I have no idea what
this blueprint says...

413
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:14,216
I've been trying to explain
to you that this is a blueprint

414
00:18:14,216 --> 00:18:16,520
for an amanto device, Kondo!

415
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,124
Oh, I see.

416
00:18:18,124 --> 00:18:19,994
Some sort of device.

417
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:23,467
Yes, and someone seems to be
planning to use that device

418
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:26,273
to commit some heinous deed
here in the capital.

419
00:18:27,944 --> 00:18:29,546
Oh, Hijikata.

420
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:34,056
What does "heinous deed" mean?

421
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:37,897
You haven't heard
a single word I said!

422
00:18:51,724 --> 00:18:54,429
<i>Drifting star embassy.</i>

423
00:18:58,204 --> 00:18:59,439
<i>An embassy?</i>

424
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,775
Gintoki.

425
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,279
"Cobra?"

426
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,449
My name is Katsura.
Not Cobra.

427
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:06,988
<i>Kotaro Katsura.</i>

428
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:09,126
<i>Member of the exclusionist</i>
<i>rebels.</i>

429
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:12,900
<i>An activist trying to rid</i>
<i>the capital of amanto aliens.</i>

430
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:14,938
Elizabeth.

431
00:19:14,938 --> 00:19:16,340
What the hell is this?

432
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,613
Gintoki, what are you doing
here in front of the Embassy?

433
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:20,715
Well, you know...

434
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:23,654
I was just jogging, taking a
walk, something like that...

435
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:26,126
I'm not really sure, you know,
but it brought me here...

436
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:27,830
That's not a good idea.

437
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,702
What do you mean?

438
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:34,376
Only I heard some rumors about
something dangerous around here.

439
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:35,445
Some rumors?

440
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:36,680
Yes, Gintoki.

441
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,885
I've heard rumors about an
amanto who's hatching a plot

442
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:40,688
to destroy all of the capital.

443
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,463
But why would an amanto want
to destroy the whole capital?

444
00:19:44,864 --> 00:19:46,133
I don't know...

445
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:49,039
But if it's true, we must punish
them for this evil plot...

446
00:19:50,943 --> 00:19:54,016
Gintoki, I don't know
what you are going to do,

447
00:19:54,016 --> 00:19:55,785
but you'd better
be very careful.

448
00:19:55,785 --> 00:19:59,059
The Embassy, as you know,
is considered foreign soil.

449
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:01,130
The Embassy is
on foreign soil...

450
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,835
Yes, I should really be careful,
then.

451
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,538
Later, Cobra.

452
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:08,945
My name is Katsura, not Cobra.

453
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,407
You know that hat is
so out of style.

454
00:20:29,152 --> 00:20:31,023
Okay!
Why don't you give it a try now?

455
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,459
But he can't do that!

456
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:33,862
What are you talking about?

457
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:35,331
It's incredibly easy!

458
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:38,370
Clear your mind, and you can
look like "John Cena."

459
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,741
Yeah, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

460
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:45,485
Okay, Kato, you can start
whenever you are ready.

461
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:47,722
Okay...

462
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:56,908
Why are your eyes so bloodshot,
what happened?

463
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,814
Were you up all night
playing video games?

464
00:21:00,014 --> 00:21:02,485
No, the game is just about
to begin.

465
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,289
Oh, give it a rest.

466
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:05,258
Something bad could happen

467
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:07,295
if you swing that toy
around like that.

468
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:08,865
What?

469
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:11,270
Did he actually notice
my sword cane?

470
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,942
Whatever, let's get on
with this,

471
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:16,613
but can you at least tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

472
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:18,784
Don't play dumb!

473
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:21,590
We already know that you've been
nosing around this place.

474
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,828
No, you're wrong about that.

475
00:21:23,828 --> 00:21:24,931
That was Cobra.

476
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:26,066
It wasn't me.

477
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,735
No more discussions!

478
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:34,015
Again?

479
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:41,697
You're leaving yourself
wide open!

480
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:44,135
You think you'll become
stronger like that?!

481
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,206
You are such an idiot!

482
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:49,479
Oh, you're so aggressive!

483
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:51,116
I'm sorry, Kato.

484
00:21:51,116 --> 00:21:52,385
Are you all right?

485
00:21:52,385 --> 00:21:53,721
I don't know.

486
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,260
Get up!
Stand up, Kato!

487
00:21:57,095 --> 00:21:58,430
Listen!

488
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,772
Keep your elbows close to your
body, aim to the inside corner,

489
00:22:02,772 --> 00:22:05,077
and strike, strike, and strike!

490
00:22:05,077 --> 00:22:07,181
Wait, Kagura!
That's a jab, not a strike.

491
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:09,286
and that won't work
for tomorrow.

492
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,891
It doesn't have anything
to do with swordsmanship!

493
00:22:11,991 --> 00:22:13,327
Impossible.
It's temporary.

494
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:14,629
Impossible.
It's nothing.

495
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:18,437
It looks like
it's my turn now....

496
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:22,312
Let me make you a real man!

497
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:24,716
Tighter!

498
00:22:24,783 --> 00:22:26,586
Like this then?

499
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:27,856
More!...

500
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:28,959
Much more!

501
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:30,728
Oh yes!

502
00:22:30,795 --> 00:22:31,463
That's it.

503
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:32,800
Yes, so good!

504
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,302
How about this?!

505
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:37,008
You've got talent.

506
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:38,979
What is this training for?

507
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:41,416
What kind of talent
does it have?

508
00:22:41,683 --> 00:22:42,785
As a dominatrix...

509
00:22:42,785 --> 00:22:43,922
But he's a man!

510
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:46,326
Anyway, that's not the point,
Sachan!

511
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:48,497
Oh, you're very patient!

512
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:50,501
As a reward,
you can have it tighter

513
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:52,705
‐if you'd like!
‐Stop it! Just untie me now!

514
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,942
Hello!

515
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,446
Thank you so much
for everything,

516
00:22:56,446 --> 00:22:57,715
but that's really enough.

517
00:22:58,684 --> 00:23:01,690
I don't think that I'll ever get
any stronger, Im sorry.

518
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:03,627
It's time that I give up...

519
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:05,498
But...

520
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:07,635
So now, I'll just leave.

521
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:10,474
Kato...

522
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:18,157
Those were my very
best clothes.

523
00:23:18,157 --> 00:23:20,829
My mom is going to be
really mad, you bastard!

524
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:23,133
You should worry more
about your own life

525
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:24,569
than about your clothing!

526
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:33,587
<i>Who</i> <i>is</i> <i>Shishimura,</i>
<i>Gintoki's</i> <i>mysterious</i> <i>attacker?</i>

527
00:23:33,587 --> 00:23:37,195
<i>And what heinous deed is</i>
<i>Kariya the sky person planning?</i>

528
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:39,098
<i>Did Kato really give up?</i>

529
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,115
<i>Hey people at HULU!</i>

530
00:23:47,115 --> 00:23:49,352
<i>If</i> <i>you'd</i> <i>like</i> <i>to</i> <i>know</i>
<i>what</i> <i>happens</i> <i>next,</i>

531
00:23:49,352 --> 00:23:51,523
<i>you gotta buy this show!</i>

532
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:54,864
