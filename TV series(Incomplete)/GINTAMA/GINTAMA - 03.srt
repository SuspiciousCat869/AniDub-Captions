1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,637
<i>So we kicked off</i>
<i>the Gin Tama anime series</i>

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:06,306
<i>with two episodes full</i>
<i>of laughs and excitement.</i>

3
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,342
<i>This time, we'll be taking</i>
<i>a trip back in time</i>

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,344
<i>to tell the story when</i>
<i>Gin and I first met.</i>

5
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,573
<i>The sword of the samurai</i>

6
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,209
<i>is not something to be kept</i>
<i>within a sheath.</i>

7
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,745
<i>It's something that you hold</i>
<i>within your soul.</i>

8
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,249
These days, samurai aren't
even really needed anymore.

9
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,186
But no matter how much
times change,

10
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:02,022
there are things that
we must never forget.

11
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,792
Even if the time comes when
you must give up your sword,

12
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,329
you must never lose the
unwavering sword held within your soul.

13
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:11,932
‐Father!
‐Father!

14
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,236
The cloudless sky of Edo City.

15
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,339
I wish I could've seen it
one last time.

16
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,009
<i>The land of the samurai.</i>

17
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,877
<i>There was a time,</i>
<i>a long time ago,</i>

18
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,013
<i>when our country</i>
<i>was called by that name.</i>

19
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,382
<i>But the skies that</i>
<i>the samurai gazed upon,</i>

20
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,317
<i>are now filled with ships</i>
<i>from other galaxies,</i>

21
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,486
<i>and no longer filled</i>
<i>with dreams and clouds.</i>

22
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,287
<i>And the towns where</i>
<i>the samurai once walked,</i>

23
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,923
<i>are now filled with insolent</i>
<i>and arrogant aliens</i>

24
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,459
<i>who walk with more pride</i>
<i>than the samurai ever did.</i>

25
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,894
<i>This is our world today.</i>

26
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,764
<i>This is our city today.</i>

27
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,333
No, you stupid idiot!

28
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,334
That's not the right one!

29
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,535
It's right there, right there!

30
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,538
Nowadays, even a stupid
chimpanzee could do this job!

31
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,508
You're human being, and you've been
working here for more than a year!

32
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,510
Why can't you do this, huh?

33
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,411
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,414
Swordsmanship is the only thing
I've ever had experience with.

35
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:01,581
You idiot!

36
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,550
You're still going on
about your sword?

37
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,887
Samurai and their swords
are all ancient history!

38
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,689
How long are you going to keep
acting as if you're still a samurai,

39
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,525
as if the samurai
were still around?

40
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,826
Aw, come on now.

41
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,694
Just leave it at that,
alright boss?

42
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,363
Hey, you there, kid.

43
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,698
Don't worry about the register,
just give me some milk.

44
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,600
Oh, sure thing!
Right away.

45
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,336
Ugh! No, Sir, you mustn't go
so easy on him.

46
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,271
He's an idiot.

47
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:28,341
Nah, it's just that lately whenever
I see whats left of the samurai...

48
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,911
I feel kind of sorry for them,

49
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,680
because when we got here,
the samurai were always spoiling

50
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,749
for a fight whenever
they got the chance.

51
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,751
But, now, it's as though
we've lost a very irritating friend.

52
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,885
It's lonely.

53
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,890
So I end up wanting
to mess with them a little.

54
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,662
<i>Twenty years ago aliens came</i>
<i>to our Capital of Edo.</i>

55
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,564
<i>The Amanto, or Sky People,</i>
<i>took over</i>

56
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,200
<i>and led to the decline of the</i>
<i>samurai and our way of life.</i>

57
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,569
<i>We were stripped of everything.</i>

58
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,271
<i>They took our swords,</i>
<i>our status, and our honor...</i>

59
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,306
<i>and everything else.</i>

60
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,874
<i>No, it wasn't just the samurai.</i>

61
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,776
<i>Every human living in this country</i>

62
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,111
<i>has probably already...</i>

63
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,679
‐Hey.
‐Huh?

64
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,683
A samurai?

65
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,857
Who do you think you are?

66
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,525
You think you can strap
on a wooden sword

67
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,594
like a samurai in the age
of the Sword Ban?

68
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,129
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

69
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,363
Shut your trap.

70
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,766
Are you in heat right now
or something, Amanto?

71
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:26,900
Look at this here.

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,637
Look at what happened to my chocolate
parfait because of all your fussing.

73
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,206
All of it spilled out onto the floor!

74
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,543
Hey you, what do you think
you are doing?

75
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,678
Don't you even know
who we are, you fool?

76
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,613
You know what?

77
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,149
My doctor told me that my blood sugar
level was too high,

78
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,317
and now I can only eat
a parfait once a week!

79
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,520
This was that one time!

80
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,829
<i>He was... far too barbaric</i>
<i>to ever be called a samurai,</i>

81
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,999
<i>but he was also too honest</i>
<i>and honorable...</i>

82
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,433
<i>to ever be called a thug.</i>

83
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,402
Hey listen, kid,
tell your manager,

84
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,070
the parfait was really great.

85
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,915
<i>What's going on?</i>

86
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,082
<i>Did you see what happened?</i>

87
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,218
All right, all right,
everyone out of the way!

88
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,853
Oh! There he is!

89
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,390
So you're the one waving around a
wooden sword and causing a riot!

90
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,659
‐Wait. No, you've got it all wrong!
‐You're not going anywhere.

91
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,595
Hey, Yashichi,
take a look inside!

92
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,596
Yes, sir!

93
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,833
Uh‐oh! It's the ambassador
from Planet Chatoran.

94
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,669
This is an intergalactic incident, man.

95
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,137
Do you realize what you've done?

96
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:37,938
Aren't you listening?

97
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,673
I already told you,
it wasn't me!

98
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,741
The man who did it
already ran off!

99
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,244
Yeah, yeah, that's exactly
what the culprit would say.

100
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:47,714
Next time hide your weapon
before you try to make your excuses.

101
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,150
Now, I'Im taking you to
the station to file a report.

102
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,917
Come along.

103
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,152
A sword?

104
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,787
A sword?

105
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,658
I just doesn't feel right.

106
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,127
I get all cranky if I don't have
enough sugar in me.

107
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,262
Hey, you!

108
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,832
How dare you make me take
the blame for what you did?

109
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,668
Everything is a complete mess
because of what you did!

110
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,072
What a conscientious kid to chase me
to give me my wooden sword?

111
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,406
Don't worry about it.

112
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,842
It's just something I bought
on a school trip totally on a whim.

113
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,143
That's not it!

114
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,713
I just barely managed
to get away from the police!

115
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,348
I keep telling them
they've got it wrong,

116
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,184
but nobody wants to listen
to what a samurai has to say!

117
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:27,020
In the end, even my own manager
began to say I was the murderer.

118
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,655
So you got fired, finally?

119
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,491
Well, you know a cashier
who can't use a register

120
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,293
is as useless as a mom
who can't make lasagna.

121
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,961
Yeah, yeah! Really?

122
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,863
So, is that how you treat
your own mother?

123
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,198
Oh, you're getting all worked up

124
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,300
just because you got fired
from a part time gig.

125
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,603
Don't you realize that nobody at all
hires samurai anymore?

126
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,672
How am I supposed
to survive from now on?

127
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,173
You idiot!

128
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,780
Why don't you quit
your whining, will you?

129
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,115
You four‐eyed idiot!

130
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:58,018
Don't even think that you're the only one
who's got problems in this world.

131
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:14,801
There are samurai who call cardboard boxes
on the streets their home these days!

132
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,371
Can't you try to be a little more
positive like they are, huh?

133
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,907
I doubt that you even know
what it means to be positive.

134
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,342
Hello.
Shinpachi?

135
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,510
Huh?

136
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,213
What are you doing here
at this time of day?

137
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,082
Tell me what happened
to your job.

138
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,184
Ack, It's my sister!

139
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,752
Oh, hello dear.

140
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,387
What are you doing
messing around out here

141
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,423
instead of working,
you little punk!

142
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,926
Do you know what kind of
financial trouble we're in this month?

143
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,329
Even your pitiful little paycheck
is crucial income!

144
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,830
We need to pay our bills!

145
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,265
‐Stop it!
‐I don't believe you!

146
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,467
This is all because of him!
I'm innocent!

147
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,436
Wait! Don't you dare!

148
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:50,704
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,606
I've gotta catch a rerun
of a TV show this evening.

150
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,449
Uhhh, I'm so sorry.

151
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,052
It's just that that was
my big intro scene,

152
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,787
so I got a little carried away.

153
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,589
I kinda went overboard.

154
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,257
I'm really sorry!

155
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,592
I'm really very sorry!

156
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,162
If "sorry" was enough, we wouldn't need
to have swords in this world.

157
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,966
Thanks to you, our dojo may not
be able continue to exist anymore.

158
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,637
<i>It's been 20 years since</i>
<i>national isolation was lifted.</i>

159
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,874
<i>The Amanto began to travel</i>
<i>here from far off planets</i>

160
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,910
<i>and Edo City has grown</i>
<i>beyond recognition.</i>

161
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,612
<i>But samurai and swords,</i>

162
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:36,483
<i>all those who once held power here</i>
<i>are now perishing one by one.</i>

163
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,019
The same goes for our dojo.

164
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,156
Because of the ban on swords,
all of our students have left.

165
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,725
Now the two of us are both
working part time jobs,

166
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,728
and the honest truth is
that we're barely scraping by.

167
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,899
We've been doing everything we can to
protect the dojo that our father left us,

168
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,168
no matter how difficult
the situation becomes.

169
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,170
But because of you...

170
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,672
it's all over, you idiot!

171
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,708
Calm down, sis!

172
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,610
Tell me something here.

173
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,512
Was your sister brought up
by gorillas?

174
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,615
Hold on, wait!
Just calm down.

175
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,417
I can't go around
committing sudoku,

176
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,452
but I do work hard
to clean up my own messes.

177
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,821
What is this? A business card?

178
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,757
Odd Jobs ‐ Gintoki Sakata.

179
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,028
Well, the thing is you can't be too picky
about jobs these days, right?

180
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,532
Because of that my business is
to do whatever I'm asked to do.

181
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,301
I am called Mr. "Odd Jobs" Gin.

182
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,304
If you've got problems, I'll solve them,
no matter what they are.

183
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,074
You're the one who's causing
us problems, you baboon!

184
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,475
‐And find me a job! And fast!
‐Alright, alright!

185
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,143
Calm down! Calm down!

186
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,012
<i>I can't find you a job,</i>

187
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,248
<i>but I can teach you a chant that'll help you</i>
<i>be less nervous at job interviews.</i>

188
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,416
<i>‐No thank you!</i>
<i>‐No thank you!</i>

189
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,717
<i>But wait!</i>

190
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,020
Hey, sis...

191
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:50,790
I just don't think it's possible to keep
running a sword fighting dojo

192
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,225
in this day and age.

193
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,762
I really can't imagine swordsmanship
ever being revived again,

194
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,800
and the truth is... we gain nothing
by protecting this dojo so desperately.

195
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,769
This isn't about profit or gain.

196
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:07,907
Does a child really need a reason to protect
the things that its parents cherished

197
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,476
after they are gone?

198
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:10,844
But, listen, sis!

199
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,713
Tell me this, what did father
ever do for us?

200
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:14,948
Greetings!

201
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:20,353
Today is the day that you're paying me
back for every last cent that you owe!

202
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,921
I simply can't wait any longer!

203
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,823
This debt is pissing me off!

204
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,693
Hey, so wait, you're in debt?

205
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,830
Seems like the two of you are leading some
pretty hairy lives for a couple of kids.

206
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,999
It's not even our debt.

207
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,100
It was our father's!

208
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,134
Shin, hush!

209
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,303
What are you blabbering about?

210
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,806
Hurry up and bring me
my money right now!

211
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,443
I need to get home to watch the rerun
of my favorite TV show tonight!

212
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,979
‐Wait a minute, today is...
‐Shut up, you moron!

213
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,682
I've been waiting for my money
since before you were even born,

214
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,885
and I'm starting
to go bald already!

215
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,853
You promised me
that you'd sell the dojo

216
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,355
if you couldn't pay me
back what you owe,

217
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,824
and I'm going to see
that you keep that promise!

218
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,292
Hold on, wait just a moment.

219
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,126
Why should I?

220
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,394
Haven't you had enough?

221
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,130
You don't need to feel obligated
to your stupid father,

222
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,733
the man who left you nothing
but debt when he died!

223
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,935
Just sell this awful dojo.

224
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,938
Stop it you little brat.

225
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,039
What do you think you're doing?!

226
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,307
Sis!

227
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,742
You little fool.

228
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,444
Did you think that I wouldn't hurt you
just because you're a woman?

229
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,747
Are you that stupid?

230
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,382
What?

231
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,985
That's quite enough of that.

232
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,821
Even though she was raised
by gorillas, she's still a lady.

233
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,662
And just who are you?

234
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,564
Is this dojo still in operation?

235
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,599
It cannot possibly
still have students!

236
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,268
Honestly, all of you,
listen up!

237
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,836
Forget about the dojo!

238
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,805
I have a better idea.

239
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,908
I'm going to make you work
to pay off your family's debt.

240
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,146
As you can see,
I happen to have started

241
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,847
a new business recently.

242
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,350
It's called High‐Leg Hot‐Pot Heaven.

243
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,519
What?!
High Leg, what...?

244
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,254
Why... why High Leg?!

245
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,057
Because I like girls
in high‐leg outfits, of course!

246
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,660
<i>Look, it's a flying nightclub</i>
<i>where we serve hotspots.</i>

247
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,064
<i>Technically, nightclubs are prohibited</i>
<i>in Edo City right now,</i>

248
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,434
<i>but if it's in the sky, it'll be out of</i>
<i>sight from government officials,</i>

249
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,435
<i>and I can do what I want!</i>

250
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:19,272
<i>It'll be a literal hotpot filled to the</i>
<i>brim with girls in high‐leg outfits!</i>

251
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,274
We'll ensnare our customers
with our sides

252
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,509
of rump steaks
and hamburger buns!

253
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,946
I've gathered so many beauties
from so many worlds,

254
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,948
and you'd be more than welcome.

255
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:33,186
Now, It comes down to either
selling this dojo or selling yourself.

256
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,721
Which will it be?

257
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:35,822
There's no way!

258
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,257
She'd never do
something like that.

259
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,191
All right, I agree.

260
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,126
‐I'll go with you.
‐Huh?!

261
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,363
Oh, my, what a devoted
daughter you are.

262
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,666
Wait! Hold on now!

263
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,935
Sis, why would you do this?!

264
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,770
We've done enough, haven't we?

265
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,704
Hey!

266
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,673
Hey, wait, sis!

267
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,710
Shinpachi, the truth is,
it's just as you were saying.

268
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,879
Nothing good will ever
come from this dojo,

269
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,614
no matter how hard
we try to save it,

270
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,116
only suffering.

271
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,117
But the truth is...

272
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,719
it's also painful to let go of.

273
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,322
Things that you can never
regain once you let go

274
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:12,225
are both painful
to keep and to discard.

275
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,227
And if it's going to be
painful either way...

276
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,665
then I would rather suffer trying to protect
what the two of us still have.

277
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,954
What is her problem, huh?

278
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,589
What a stupid sister I have!

279
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,258
She's always talking
about father.

280
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,759
And what did baldy
ever do for us?

281
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,627
Nothing!

282
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,929
He played chess with us
once in a while and that's it!

283
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,298
Hold on.
Your dad was bald?

284
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,734
Well, he was mentally bald, or...

285
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,736
Hey, why are you still here now?

286
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,739
And why are you baking something
so elaborate in my house?

287
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,140
What is this?

288
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,578
Well, I just can't go on without eating
something sweet periodically.

289
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,114
Then why not make something simpler
and easier and less messy!

290
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,951
Sweet, sweet.

291
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,121
Listen, shouldn't you go
after your sister?

292
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,890
I really don't care.

293
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,359
It was her decision
to leave here.

294
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,896
It's clear now, she really is
my father's daughter.

295
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,998
She's just like him.

296
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,367
<i>Father was a good</i>
<i>natured person</i>

297
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,204
<i>who always talked about</i>
<i>duty and compassion.</i>

298
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:35,842
<i>Because of that nature, he got taken</i>
<i>advantage of, and he died in debt.</i>

299
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,111
How could he have been
so careless?

300
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:42,048
I don't want to die with nothing but a
bunch of ideological virtues to my name.

301
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,051
<i>No matter how much</i>
<i>times change,</i>

302
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,887
<i>there are things that</i>
<i>we must never forget.</i>

303
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,722
Does a child really
need a reason

304
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,924
to protect the things
that its parents cherished,

305
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,693
even after they're gone?

306
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,163
That kind of thinking only
gets in the way nowadays.

307
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,966
I swear I'm going to do
better than they ever did.

308
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,400
Is that so?

309
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:05,738
But to me, you don't seem to be
doing very well at all, to be honest.

310
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:12,211
Samurai don't need any
complicated reasons to act.

311
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,747
If they have something
they want to protect,

312
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,582
they should draw their sword.

313
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,752
Tell me, kid,
do you love your sister?

314
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,024
"Watch the beautiful
sunset from heaven.

315
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,593
The first boat leaves
this afternoon at four."

316
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,494
This is bad!

317
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,562
The ship's about to leave!

318
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,564
Can't you go any faster
on this thing?!

319
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,567
Hey, its always safety first
when I'm driving,

320
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,402
and it'll hurt if we crash.

321
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,271
Now's not the time
to be saying that!

322
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,107
Remember, my sister is
in high‐leg hotpot danger!

323
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,175
Hey, you, without the helmet!

324
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,010
I need you to stop right there!

325
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,912
What do you want, officer?

326
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,048
If this is the feudal period, then
there are no traffic regulations yet.

327
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,584
I mean that's true, but it's going to hurt
if you crash, man.

328
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,786
I'm just telling you this
because I'm concerned.

329
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,321
It's okay, I'll be alright.

330
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,722
I'm pretty hard headed, thanks.

331
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,690
Hey, really?

332
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,259
I'm only trying to be considerate here,
and that's how you act?

333
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,229
It really hurts my feelings,
and it's really a big deal!

334
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,430
Just shut up.

335
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,765
Didn't I tell you
that I'm hard headed?

336
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,533
Ahh, that hurt!

337
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,736
I've got a nose bleed!

338
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,371
Look!

339
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,574
Hot Pot Heaven
is already taking off!

340
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,276
What are we going to do?
It's so high up!

341
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,412
Aaah! Sis!

342
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,515
He'll pay for mocking me like that!
After him!

343
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:23,983
Yes!

344
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:29,989
Hey, you little punks!

345
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,191
Did you really think
you can outrun the police?

346
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,464
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

347
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,399
Please allow me
to serve you tonight.

348
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,135
I already told you,
that's not how you do it!

349
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,606
You're supposed to show more
cleavage when you say that, stupid!

350
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,977
Unfortunately, I have never had any
cleavage at all in my entire life!

351
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,445
Oh, sorry.

352
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:55,181
I didn't realize you couldn't show
any even if you wanted to.

353
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,485
Fine then, next we'll work
on your technique!

354
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,054
It's time to put on your high‐leg outfit
for some hot pot heaven!

355
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,123
Hold on, that's a bit...

356
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,626
But this is how we please
our customers, honey.

357
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,962
Put it on or have you
lost your nerve, ah?

358
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:15,635
It's way too late to be having second
thoughts about this job, dear!

359
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,938
If you think I'll go easy on you just
because we're on mainstream media,

360
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,306
you're very mistaken!

361
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,342
Remember, this is for your dojo,
so buck up, little soldier!

362
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,487
What is that? Ah!

363
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,124
Hold on, hold on,
what's going on?

364
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,727
Hey, boss!
Whats going on?

365
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,428
Are you alright?

366
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,665
A car just...
A car just crashed into us.

367
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,733
Wait, this is bad!
It's a police car!

368
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,669
That means that the cops
are onto us!

369
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,737
Don't worry, guys.

370
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,773
It's just a rental car,
I'm not the police!

371
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,944
Hello, my name is Odd Jobs Gin.

372
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,011
Tell me right now, sis!

373
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,147
They haven't forced you into
that high‐leg outfit yet, have they?

374
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,214
Shinpachi?

375
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,884
What are you two imbeciles
doing in my nightclub?

376
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,286
We've come to get
my sister back!

377
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,387
You idiot!

378
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,489
Don't any of you understand
that it's too late?

379
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,724
Are you stupid?

380
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,795
Listen! You lot can expect your dojo
to be destroyed after all of this!

381
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,331
I don't care about the stupid dojo.

382
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,835
I want a dojo where my sister
is always happy and smiling.

383
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,638
If that dojo is going
to cause my sister to cry,

384
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,873
then the hell with the dojo!

385
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,942
Oh, Shin...

386
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,344
You idiots!

387
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,846
What do you think you can accomplish
with just the two of you?

388
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,381
Tell me that!

389
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,695
Hey listen, here's the plan.

390
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,897
I'll distract them while you two
find an escape pod

391
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,466
or something and get out of here.

392
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,934
What... what about you?

393
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:57,470
You just focus on protecting
your sister right now.

394
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,773
I'll protect what
I want to protect.

395
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,242
Just what are you
going on about, you moron?

396
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,543
Die!

397
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,814
All right!

398
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,249
Who's next?

399
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,083
Oh wow!

400
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,052
But his style is ridiculous.

401
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,254
But crazy strong!

402
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,024
Shinichi!
Get out of here!

403
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,059
It's Shinpachi, you idiot!

404
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,664
Shinpachi, will that man
be all right?

405
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,799
Why is he doing
all this for us?

406
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,868
I don't know,
but I know he'll be back,

407
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,503
because I sense it in him!

408
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,905
The thing that father
always talked about,

409
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,774
that samurai sword
in the soul.

410
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,013
See, he really
did come back for us!

411
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,314
That was really tough!

412
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,350
It was far tougher
than I thought!

413
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,818
Then try a little harder!

414
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,753
You didn't even last
a minute against them!

415
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,921
Don't be stupid!

416
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,891
Do you know how tough it is to make
a whole minute of anime?

417
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,560
Just keep looking
for an escape pod right now!

418
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,529
This is...

419
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,130
This is...

420
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,032
The engine room?

421
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,836
It's a dead end for you!

422
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,306
Now, it's time to finish
this game of tag.

423
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,208
How pathetic you are.

424
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,611
The samurai who once protected
the country with their swords

425
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,146
are now good for nothing losers

426
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,449
who can't even protect
a single little girl.

427
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:20,086
There's nothing at all left for
you to protect in this country.

428
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,154
The sky, the ground,
the Capital,

429
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,223
they all belong to us,
the Amanto.

430
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,792
The country, the sky
and ground?

431
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,861
I couldn't care less
about any of that.

432
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,831
Because I'm busy protecting the things
that are right in front of me.

433
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:36,168
I don't know how many things I've tried
and failed to protect in the past.

434
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,438
I don't have anything left
to lose anymore,

435
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,274
but if I find something laying
in the dirt in front of me...

436
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,810
I swear, I'm going to pick it up!

437
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,413
What a sappy warrior
spirit you have.

438
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,148
I'm tired of all of this!

439
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,416
Just die!

440
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,151
Hold on, sir!
No!

441
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,253
What will happen if
we hit the you know what?

442
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,489
We'll go crashing into the earth
along with the ship.

443
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,924
Oh no, I forgot all about that.

444
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,026
Wait, is he... is he climbing it!?

445
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,495
Hey, hey, hold on!

446
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:03,496
That's not okay at all!

447
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:06,232
That's the beating heart
of this ship!

448
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,736
What's important to my clients
is also important to me.

449
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,938
And if it's for the sake
of that, I'll do...

450
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,475
absolutely anything!

451
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,213
No, I don't believe it!

452
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,716
I don't believe that idiot!
He really did it!

453
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,459
What is this floating sensation?

454
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,527
I feel sick!

455
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:35,928
Is this thing falling?

456
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:36,896
Are we all falling?

457
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:40,799
<i>I feel sick!</i>

458
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,275
<i>Luckily, we were over</i>
<i>the ocean when we fell, but...</i>

459
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:51,810
<i>who knows what</i>
<i>would have happened</i>

460
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,646
<i>if we had been over</i>
<i>the city when we fell.</i>

461
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,415
I've never seen such
a crazy samurai before.

462
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,684
Yeah but...

463
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,654
in the end, he managed
to save us, right?

464
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:03,756
Hey, what's your problem?

465
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,559
Look, man, I helped you
arrest a bunch of ruffians

466
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,561
who were disturbing
the peace in Edo City!

467
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,096
You can at least let the fact that
I borrowed a police car slide!

468
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,064
You call it "borrowing"?

469
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,166
Both my car and I
are a complete wreck!

470
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,367
You've always been a wreck!

471
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,969
In fact, you actually look
better like that.

472
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,604
Seriously?
Which part?

473
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,040
<i>‐Or are you insulting me...</i>
‐Hey, sis, listen.

474
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:22,908
‐You should go.
‐Huh?

475
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:26,412
I can already tell that there's something
that you see in him, right?

476
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,714
You should go with him
and find it.

477
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,482
Go find your sword.

478
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,618
And I'll look for mine
in my own way.

479
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,487
Don't worry.
I won't do anything rash.

480
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,256
Because the truth is,

481
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,792
I don't want to see you crying
as a fully grown man either.

482
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:41,961
Oh, sis.

483
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:45,364
<i>Even if there comes a time</i>
<i>when you must give up your sword,</i>

484
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,767
<i>you must never lose the unwavering</i>
<i>sword kept in your soul.</i>

485
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,337
You are a terrible officer!
Admit it!

486
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:52,071
I am a hero!

487
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:55,040
<i>Father, It's very difficult for me</i>

488
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,077
<i>to determine the nature</i>
<i>of this strange man's soul,</i>

489
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,147
<i>but although it's dim, I think it's</i>
<i>definitely glistening in darkness.</i>

490
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,851
<i>And I really think,</i>
<i>I'd like to stay beside him</i>

491
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,621
<i>to watch it shine for a while.</i>

492
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,684
<i>Oh no! I forgot my comic books</i>
<i>go on sale today!</i>

493
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,520
<i>Should I use this opportunity</i>
<i>to grow out of them?</i>

494
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,254
<i>No...</i>

495
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,757
<i>Men are boys at heart until</i>
<i>the day they die!</i>

496
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:52,725
<i>The next episode</i>

497
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,833
Uh... I wish I could shoot a
Getsuga Tensho from my sword.
