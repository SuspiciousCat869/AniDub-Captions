1
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:05,038
Please keep the lights on and
don't sit too close to the TV.

2
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,967
Why do I have to come all the way
out here on such a freezing night?

3
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,903
How many stores do I have to
visit to find meat buns...

4
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,405
Oh, I should've bought
sweet buns for myself.

5
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,807
I don't really like meat buns.

6
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,715
Oh, Man, now they're
all messed up.

7
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,484
Oh, Man, now they're
all messed up...

8
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,220
How could you do this to me,
it's all your fault!

9
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,622
Look, you completely
wrecked my sleigh!

10
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,057
Now this year is done for!

11
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,692
And it is all thanks to you!

12
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,527
Screw you, it's your own fault!

13
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,162
You old fart, we agreed
that you'd get off

14
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,931
the sleigh whenever
we went downhill!

15
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,799
I should be the one
pulling the sleigh,

16
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,735
I was running from it
for my life!

17
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,403
It kept bashing against
my Achilles tendon!

18
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,371
Now I'm bloody!

19
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:21,141
All you have to do is outrun the speed
of the sleigh, that isn't so hard.

20
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,909
You're a reindeer, aren't you?!

21
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,079
Your dad was awesome, and he
pulled the sleigh like a real pro,

22
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,714
even when we were going downhill.

23
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,549
He was an excellent reindeer!

24
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,085
Yeah well, you may have
really liked my dad...

25
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,389
but he was always saying bad things
about you whenever he got home.

26
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,456
You are a liar!

27
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,025
Carl and I were like brothers!

28
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,526
He would never do that!

29
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,094
Seriously, he hated your guts!

30
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,597
His last words were, "His white beard
is actually brown"!!

31
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,766
Don't you dare say that out loud,
you bastard!

32
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:49,069
We can't let anyone find out I dye
my beard white every Christmas!

33
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,471
Well, you're the one announcing
it to the world!

34
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:52,906
Hey, come on you guys!

35
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:53,874
‐Settle down.
‐Shut up!

36
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,108
What are you guys doing?

37
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,476
‐Shut up!
‐Shut up!

38
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,744
Ow!
Damn it!

39
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,279
What the hell is your problem?!

40
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,356
Just cut the crap, you two.

41
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,924
It's the middle of the night.

42
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,093
People are trying
to sleep right now.

43
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,128
Now look, I don't know what
happened with you, but...

44
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,130
Well, you beat us up
is what happened...

45
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,332
Come on, guys,
let's have a drink.

46
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,901
Who the hell are you?

47
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,437
Drinks help facilitate communication
between people,

48
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,005
like a kind of like
a social lubricant.

49
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,673
I think Napoleon said
something like that,

50
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,941
but I could be wrong...

51
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:31,411
Hey buddy, get us three more bottles
and some assorted food.

52
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,913
The beardo will cover the check.

53
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:33,847
Yes, sir.

54
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,215
The Beardo will pay?

55
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,550
‐Are you talking about me?
‐Here.

56
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,453
I ought to shave this stupid beard off
already.

57
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,187
So tell me...

58
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,755
why were you two arguing?

59
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,256
Who are you guys anyway?

60
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,159
Do you guys deliver evening
mail or something?

61
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,027
I uh...

62
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,862
eh, I thought it was kinda obvious...

63
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,898
Well, it's against regulations
so I really can't tell you,

64
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,334
but I ride a sleigh and give kids
something to dream about.

65
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,702
You mean like Peter Pan?

66
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,471
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sort of...

67
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,372
‐And my name starts with "Sa."
‐"Sa"?

68
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,041
Satan?

69
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,342
Its close!
But it has...

70
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,710
a far better meaning!

71
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,413
Hm, okay, sorry to cut into
your conversation,

72
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,981
but I think I have the answer.

73
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,916
It is pretty obvious actually.

74
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,485
The hint is hanging
between his legs.

75
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,120
What are you saying?
What kind of hint is that?

76
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,122
What kind of answer is
that gonna lead to?

77
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,023
I don't give a damn if it's
Sandwich or Santa.

78
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,925
That's it!
You just got it right!

79
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,693
Yeah, you just got it right!

80
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,929
So, you're a wild old man who
rides a sleigh at midnight

81
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,865
and sneaks into people's homes
through chimneys, right?

82
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:25,799
Well, yeah, but...

83
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,634
you just described
me like a burglar.

84
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,335
I got it!

85
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,836
Sorry to interrupt your
conversation again,

86
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,438
but I think I have the answer now.

87
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,974
These are the guys who ride
around in a sleigh stealing

88
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,942
undies from the rich
to give to the poor.

89
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,444
That's not what I'm doing at all!

90
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,178
You look like a gentleman,

91
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,213
but you sure
have a twisted mind, you know!

92
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,054
Presents!
It's all presents, okay?

93
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,524
I ride a sleigh and deliver presents
to all the good children.

94
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,858
That's my job!

95
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,261
But my sleigh is completely wrecked,
you see?

96
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,595
And now it's just...

97
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,631
You don't need a sleigh
to do your job do you?

98
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,733
I absolutely do; the sleigh,
the reindeer,

99
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,735
and the red outfit are my
three trademarks!

100
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,304
It would shatter the children's
image of me if I didn't have them!

101
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,238
A reindeer?

102
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,940
But he looks more
like a monster...

103
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,743
I don't really get it but...

104
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,078
it seems like you're in a fix,
do you need some help?

105
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,747
Here's my business card.

106
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,650
I do everything and anything,
a jack of all trades...

107
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,852
And I'll help you out,
if you pay me.

108
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:19,686
What?!

109
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,154
What can you possibly do?

110
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,423
Can you get us a sleigh right now?

111
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,891
No problem at all.

112
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,095
Come on, hop in.

113
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,065
Hop in my ass!

114
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,568
Someone is actually inhabiting
the thing right now!

115
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,603
You can actually see him?

116
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,638
What you're seeing is
the cardboard fairy.

117
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,274
He's a fairy that only people
with pure souls can see.

118
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,109
It's obvious you can see him too!

119
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,145
I mean, he's glaring right at you!

120
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,013
We said we needed a sleigh!

121
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,081
That is a cart.

122
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,516
It's not a cart.

123
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,784
It's my home!

124
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:51,885
Oh, I'm so sorry.

125
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,987
Don't worry about the little details...

126
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,922
Sleigh, cart, it's all the same thing.

127
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,057
They even sound almost the same.

128
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,225
It's not a cart.

129
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,126
It's my home sweet home, man!

130
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,094
Oh, I'm sorry fairy...

131
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,363
Your mission is to make
children's dreams come true.

132
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,198
Remember what got you here
in the first place...

133
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,266
Remember those days...

134
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,767
when your eyes were still
glistening with joy,

135
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,236
back when you first started
this job.

136
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,371
What do you know
about me and my job?

137
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:14,107
Oh, besides, if you're going to worry
about your stupid image...

138
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,842
you ought to start by
addressing this gut, man.

139
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,010
Any kid who sees it will think,

140
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,546
"Oh, he's just like my dad,"
and be so disappointed.

141
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,248
It's supposed to be like that.

142
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,415
I'm a legend, man.

143
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,051
I'm an inspiration to all
those fat comedians.

144
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,087
Also, red isn't the right color
for you.

145
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,955
It makes you look fatter
than you actually are.

146
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,490
Ditch the outfit.
It's totally wrong.

147
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,258
‐No, let me go...
‐You'd look better

148
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,192
in something more chic.

149
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,995
I already told you, this is one
of my three trademarks!

150
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:35,895
No!
Stop!

151
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,032
Hey, if I take off my outfit,
I'll just be a regular old man.

152
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,433
Hey!

153
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,154
Now this is just...

154
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,422
Isn't right.

155
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,457
No, you both look good and chic.

156
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,860
Just as I thought, black makes
you look slim and cool.

157
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,262
It also makes me nervous
for some strange reason...

158
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,398
like I should go home
and lock the door.

159
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,033
That's because we look
like thieves!!

160
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,635
Nah, you're more like one of
those wild looking dads.

161
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,937
Just throw on a leather jacket
and it'll make you look sexy,

162
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,973
and you'll draw the girls like
a magnet for sure!

163
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,641
There's nothing sexy
about this look!

164
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,276
Look at me, I look like
a grave robber!

165
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,045
Not to mention this
homeless dude...

166
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,646
is wearing my outfit now!

167
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,215
Hey, listen up, can you
give my suit back!

168
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,318
But I wanna be a fashion icon!

169
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,752
But you're already an icon.

170
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,887
You don't need to wear that.

171
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,855
You're an icon for all the guys
on the streets!

172
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,425
Let's start here, alright?

173
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,428
This is a poor residential area,
we should help them out.

174
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,897
Oh, man, if we get caught in
these clothes, it's over,

175
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,565
we'll be immediately reported.

176
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,634
Why does my heart have
to beat so fast...

177
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,502
when I'm not even
doing anything bad...?

178
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,971
So, which child should we start with?

179
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:55,108
I'm not visiting spoiled kids
who ask for video games.

180
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,244
Let's start with the kids who just
ask for a yoyo or something.

181
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,914
Do you really think you're qualified to
make children's dreams come true?

182
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,149
Kids these days don't want
simple toys like...

183
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,385
I found someone, Yuri Tsukishima...

184
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,454
It's hard to find a kid like her these.

185
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,759
A‐A loving mom, that might be difficult...

186
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,094
Yuri...

187
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,995
I wonder if her mom died...

188
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,832
Ben, it's none of our business,
and you can't make two wishes.

189
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,600
Let's skip her.
How about the other kids?

190
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,868
Is there anyone who wished for...

191
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,069
something like a yoyo?

192
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,838
Why are you so obsessed
with yoyos?

193
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,806
Well, I brought lots of yoyos

194
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,541
because I thought they would
be popular again,

195
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,309
but I was wrong.

196
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,145
I was right about last year's Korean
pop star boom in Japan though.

197
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,613
What kind of presents
did you give to kids

198
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,914
during the Korean
pop star boom?

199
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:36,516
Oh!

200
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,152
Hey, heh, there might be
a yoyo boom after all.

201
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,287
Yoyo and wings to fly
to the future.

202
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,056
I want a pair of those too...

203
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,791
Who's next?
Who wants a yoyo?

204
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:45,959
Just forget about the yoyos!

205
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:46,793
You shut up.

206
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,129
Hey, I don't have anything
else but yoyos this year!

207
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,197
We have to find kids
who want yoyos!

208
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,298
Are you kidding me?

209
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,834
You're just an old man who
hands out yoyos to kids!

210
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:55,935
And nothing else.
All right...

211
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,170
let's see here...

212
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,671
‐Here we go!
‐Here we go!

213
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,309
Is this a wish list or a diary?!

214
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,811
How old is this kid...

215
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,815
Damn it!
We were being too loud!

216
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,550
And you're still being too loud!

217
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,551
And now so am I!

218
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,819
Let's get out of here!

219
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:13,520
Look there!

220
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,721
It's Yuri!

221
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,957
Yuri who wished for a
"yoyo and a loving mom."

222
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,726
And she's waiting for you guys...

223
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,261
She believes that you guys
are going to make

224
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,529
her Christmas wishes come true.

225
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,898
She wrote "a yoyo" next to
"a loving mom."

226
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,100
That means she
really wants a yoyo.

227
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,668
She might have some
memories of her dead mother

228
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,303
attached to that yoyo.

229
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:33,139
We can't do anything about her mom,
but a yoyo we can get her.

230
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,308
You should visit her ...

231
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,179
‐Yuri!
‐Yuri!

232
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,814
Mom, there are thieves!

233
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,248
Thieves outside!

234
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,250
Huuuuh?
Huuuuh?

235
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,091
Um...

236
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,126
Loving Mom?!

237
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,894
Loving Mom.
What?

238
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,500
Please go back to being
a loving mom!

239
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,174
The sun is rising, Ben.

240
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,010
We haven't made a single kid's
wish come true yet

241
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,580
but the sun is already
trying to come up, Ben...

242
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,048
This year's Christmas...

243
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,483
was the very worst.

244
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,452
It's our last chance, Ben.
We can't go home like this...

245
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,955
Let's pick a kid whose family
is so poor

246
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,390
that the only toys they get
are from the Dollar Store,

247
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,359
and then we can grant their
wish.

248
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,562
Then we can go home with
that child's smile in our heart...

249
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,664
Odd Jobs, help us, please.

250
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,100
I already told you that
there's no such kid

251
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,436
in this age where there's
practically everything they...

252
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,171
Hey!

253
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,745
Thanks for coming, Santa.

254
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,081
No problem, no problem at all.

255
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,152
You know you're very lucky to have
a child who is so low maintenance.

256
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,554
‐I finally feel like
‐Where is she?

257
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:58,491
I'm doing my work as
Santa.

258
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,393
You should really look at
yourself in the mirror...

259
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,529
You don't look like anything
other than a thief.

260
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,032
Hey, look!

261
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,535
Look! It seems like she fell
asleep in the living room.

262
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,504
What are you two doing??

263
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,406
Are you guys here to pull
a prank or something?

264
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,175
She's got a snot bubble!

265
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,147
What are you old farts getting
so excited about?

266
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,516
Hey, my turn, my turn.
Let me try this.

267
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,090
What are you doing here?

268
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,793
Where is my meat bun?!

269
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,397
She's half asleep!

270
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,131
Half‐asleep!

271
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,666
Shoot!
Gotta get out of here.

272
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,200
I've gotta feed the dog!
Let go!

273
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,244
Let me go!

274
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:52,879
No you let me go!

275
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,236
Hm, I fell asleep under the table!

276
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,538
Oh!

277
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,041
Meat buns!

278
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,277
Gin actually went and got
me meat buns!

279
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,720

on New Year's Eve is there?

293

You're right.

When our dad was still alive,

we'd used to always have a blast

Gin sure is late, though...

297
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,839
He went out to buy his comics
and hasn't come back since...

298
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,343
I wonder if he had an accident and lost
his memory again.

299
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,212
He's probably just having an
accident with some random girl.

300
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,714

Good grief.
There's only one left...

311
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,240
So...
what should we do?

312
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,241
Well, I've...

313
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,577
already been to seven or eight
convenience stores already.

314
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,313
Everyone's got time to shop
so they're already sold out.

315
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,548
Oh yeah? I think I've been about

316
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,049
to ten convenience
stores, too.

317
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,785
If I include those ones, I've actually
been to 15.

318
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:13,986
Well this sure is.

319
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,889
This sure is a pickle, Teddy really
wants to read these comics...

320
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,691
Oh, Teddy is my son.

321
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,859
He's 5 years old.

322
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,095
Well, my mom really wants it, too.

323
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,563
And she's very sick,

324
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,231
I wonder if she's going to
make it through the new years.

325
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,799
She's probably not going to...

326
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,168
Oh, my Teddy is going to die, too.

327
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,636
Teddy is going to die?

328
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,972
Well... I think you understand.
Sorry buddy.

329
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,006
Wait a minute.

330
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,742
What? Does Teddy really
want the comics?

331
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,577
Comic books these days
have really gone downhill,

332
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,145
I think he'll like this better.

333
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,615
Uh, Teddy is only five years old...

334
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:43,583
Yeah...

335
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,685
but Teddy might like this, uh, well.

336
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,153
Maybe I should buy it...

337
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,888
It's not for me, it's just for Teddy...

338
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,289
Yes, can I help you?

339
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,390
Hey, wait a minute!

340
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,458
That's not fair!

341
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,927
No, no, I think Teddy is really
too young to read comics.

342
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,028
That's definitely better for him.

343
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,830
He's way too young
for this if anything!

344
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,832
Besides, there is no
such person as Teddy.

345
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,968
Teddy doesn't exist in reality, idiot!

346
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,002
You're the idiot!

347
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,904
I don't have a dying mom either!

348
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,239
You stupid moron!

349
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:07,707
‐Here's the money!
‐Here's the money!

350
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,108
Hey!
You're killing me!

351
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,544
You ought be ashamed of yourself
reading comics at your age!

352
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,147
Do you have Peter Pan
syndrome and never grow up?

353
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,848
‐No fairy will come near you!
‐Excuse me?

354
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,717
They're probably talking crap
about you right about now!

355
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,786
Look whose talking,
you pathetic comic freak!?!

356
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:20,753
Don't you have
anything better to do

357
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,921
than. reading comic books
on New Years?!

358
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,256
Excuse me...

359
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,793
Excuse me, but neither of you
have enough money for this...

360
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:27,660
‐What?
‐What?

361
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,629
Yeah, it's not enough money...

362
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,965
You have just enough if you
combine your funds.

363
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:33,933
What do you wanna do?

364
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,538
So, normally, New Year's Eve is a
time to loosen up and celebrate.

365
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,340
But we have a duty
to defend Edo City.

366
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,743
So tonight let's limit
ourselves to one glass.

367
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,679
Just know that I'm proud of each
and every one of you...

368
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,048
and of your showing
restraint tonight.

369
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,684
Thanks to all of you, for your
hard work this year!

370
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:52,485
Cheers!

371
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,854
You really have no limits, do you?

372
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,490
They're all totally helpless...

373
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,592
Aw, come on!
It's New Year's!

374
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,928
Nothing wrong with having
a little fun once in a while.

375
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,030
You're having fun
every single day...

376
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,364
Oh, well.

377
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,299
I'm not going to drink tonight,

378
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,900
but you guys go ahead
and have a good time.

379
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,168
Is there anything you're
worried about that

380
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,937
you're not saying, you bastard?

381
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,106
Some of the Viper's gang is still
out there, and apparently

382
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,276
a bunch of the explosives have
gone missing from that warehouse.

383
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,246
It's like a pesky snake
that still lives on...

384
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,215
even after its head is cut off.

385
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,518
Like I said, I'll read this today,
and you can borrow it tomorrow.

386
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:26,519
What do you mean "borrow it"?

387
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,654
I paid for it as well, you bastard,
and let me ask..

388
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,223
Which part of these comics
do you read?

389
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,859
I bet you just read two or three
episodes, and then dump it,

390
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,327
right, but I read all the episodes.

391
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,761
I love comics more than you do.

392
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,629
What do you know?

393
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,431
I'm not satisfied with reading
only the episodes,

394
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,366
so I even read the comments
from the writers at the end.

395
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,168
I even read the lousy
editor's comments!

396
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,103
Hey I even read
the survey results

397
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,738
and then I answer all
the questionnaires

398
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,974
and then I send them in to
the editors every week!

399
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,075
That's no big deal!

400
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,077
I even read those sketchy
ads on the back page,

401
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,912
you know, those phony
looking lucky charm ads.

402
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,146
Sometimes I even order them.

403
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,115
Hey, if you don't cut it out,
the comics

404
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,450
are gonna tear into two,
damn it!

405
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,584
Let's take a timeout.

406
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,919
Take your hands off it for now,
and I promise

407
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,053
I won't run off with it.

408
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,488
You take your hands off it first.

409
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,656
Then I'll do it.

410
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,523
Grow up!!

411
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,758
Grown ups would consider
the safety

412
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,661
of the comic books first and foremost,
don't you think?

413
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,297
It'll be safe as long as you
take your hands off it.

414
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,899
Then let's take our hands off
it at the same time,

415
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,300
counting, one, two and three.

416
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,067
Wait a sec!

417
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,203
Do we take our hands off at
the "t" or the "e" of three?

418
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,804
At the "e."
No, after the "e."

419
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,007
At the moment you say "e,"
or right after you say "e"?

420
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,608
I'm getting so confused now...

421
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,545
Oh wait, let's ask that old lady
to hold it for us.

422
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,014
I'll bet that bent up
old lady is your spy.

423
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,016
You probably paid her to give
it right back to you.

424
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,952
If I could pay an old lady, I'd have
bought the comics myself already!

425
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,153
Excuse me, old lady,

426
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,255
but could you hold onto
this for us for a moment?

427
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,692
Well, I understand that you're a bit
surprised, but please?

428
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,764
Hey.. Are you guys going to
take your hands off it or what?

429
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:45,831
Hey, hey, cut it out.

430
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,301
You're still refusing to
take your hands off it?!

431
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,302
What are you saying?!

432
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,703
I'm all loose and everything.

433
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,038
You're the one squeezing
it too hard!

434
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:55,975
Whoaaaaahhh!

435
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,210
Hey!
Take your hands off it!

436
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,912
Gee!
You're gonna kill the old lady!

437
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,580
Hey old lady, that's enough!

438
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,382
Don't push yourself!

439
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,352
‐Crap!
‐Crap!

440
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,142
I see...

441
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,711
Viper's gang got away...

442
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:33,646
And then...

443
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,514
What might their plan be?

444
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,950
Rumor is they're going to
attack the sky terminal.

445
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,985
Let's see...

446
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,121
I heard they'll attack the
sky terminal with a truck...

447
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,590
one full of justa
something bombs...

448
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,293
I can't believe they're going
to do it on New Year's Eve...

449
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,327
What do you think?

450
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,595
Do you think they'll do it?

451
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,297
No way.
Not a chance.

452
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,365
Why is that?

453
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,966
Barbarians who can't enjoy
a New Year's

454
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,701
will never accomplish anything.

455
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,770
Edo is a sophisticated city.

456
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,543
Hey, wait there!

457
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,178
Those comics are mine!

458
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:07,880
No way!

459
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,416
Those are my comics!

460
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,585
Is he...
a monster?

461
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:13,919
He's so acrobatic!

462
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,389
Sorry, brother!

463
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:19,592
I may not look it, but I actually
used to be a secret agent.

464
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,862
Hey! Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait!

465
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,206
If you want to die, then do it
on your own!

466
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,708
I thought it was over for me.

467
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,310
I even came close to crying,
you bastard!

468
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,079
I'm the one who thought
it was all over!

469
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,580
My life flashed before
my eyes.

470
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,549
Hell, it's still flashing
before my eyes!

471
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,018
Just keep flashing for the
rest of your life, idiot!!

472
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,255
All right!
It's mine!

473
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:52,992
I won't let you have it!

474
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,527
You don't even understand
the superhero comic's

475
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,561
three key principles,

476
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,996
"Friendship," "Hard Work"
and "Victory."

477
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,864
You don't deserve to read it!

478
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,002
‐It's mine!
‐I won't let you have it!...

479
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,106
"Friendship, Hard Work and Victory?"

480
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,642
You think you can master those
just by reading comic books?

481
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:10,910
Pathetic!

482
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,345
You're just trying to fill the
void in your life by reading

483
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,580
those comic books.

484
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,982
You're just reading comics
to make yourself feel better.

485
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,752
Comics should never be
used for that purpose!

486
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,828
Alright...

487
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,764
This is the best way for men to
communicate at the end of the day.

488
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,066
We'll settle this just as they
do in the comic books!

489
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,770
I prefer love‐comedy manga
over battle manga.

490
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,838
But I have no choice.

491
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,140
Sometimes a man must fight
for his true love!

492
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,741
Gintoki Sakata.

493
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,243
Zenzo Hattori...

494
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,611
‐Now!
‐Now!

495
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:48,881
What was that?

496
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,683
Did you just hear a
weird noise out there?

497
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,686
I wonder if the cops know that
we're here in this truck.

498
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,187
Don't worry about it...

499
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,723
it's New Year's Eve and even
cops are partying tonight.

500
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,260
Besides, this looks like a
perfectly ordinary truck,

501
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,396
so no one will ever guess it's
equipped with a ton of deadly bombs.

502
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,167
Edo City will soon be a sea of fire.

503
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,438
What?

504
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,441
Give me back...

505
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,376
My comics!

506
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,878
Hey!

507
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,381
Give me back...

508
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,151
My comics!

509
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:31,924
<i>"Friendship...</i>

510
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,058
<i>Hard Work...</i>

511
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,326
<i>Victory"...</i>

512
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,895
<i>I don't quite get it, but...</i>

513
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,664
<i>Those are important principles...</i>

514
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,833
Who gives a shit!!

515
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,035
This JUMP comic book
is all mine!

516
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,277
Big sister, what's that gong,
gong, gong?

517
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,145
Is it the sound of some
high school kid...

518
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,481
banging his head against the
wall for not getting any dates?

519
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,082
No, that's not it, Kagura.

520
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:58,617
That's the sound of a businessman

521
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,420
who's been laid off banging his fist
against rocks, swearing revenge.

522
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,589
Hey, sis, what are you
teaching her, anyway?

523
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:04,390
It's all right.

524
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,491
You have to lie
once in a while

525
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,293
to give a kid something
to hope and dream of.

526
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,794
Well, there's no hopes
and dreams

527
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,296
in that revenge story
you just told her...

528
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,965
Kagura, listen to me, that's
the New Year's Eve bell.

529
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,902
They ring that bell 108 times on New
Year's Eve every year.

530
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:17,970
108 times?

531
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,272
<i>That's gonna make everyone bang</i>
<i>their head against the wall!</i>

532
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,575
The number 108 symbolizes...

533
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,977
the number of a person's
earthly desires.

534
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,946
Each time the bell is struck,

535
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:29,548
another desire is struck out
from your soul,

536
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,417
so you can start the
new year fresh.

537
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,221
Kagura, dear, your soul is already
clean because you're young...

538
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,023
so that mean you don't
really need to clean it,

539
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,525
but as soon as people
grow up,

540
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,994
they become more
and more greedy...

541
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,463
<i>Kagura, Shinpachi,</i>

542
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,465
<i>I hope you two don't</i>
<i>grow up to be like that.</i>

543
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:50,269
<i>Because pursuing your material</i>
<i>desire will only ruin you.</i>

544
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,137
The JUMP...

545
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,239
comics...

546
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,307
are all mine...

547
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,045
Looking at it up close...

548
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,683
it's HUMP comics.

549
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,350
<i>Is that heavy snow?</i>

550
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,386
<i>The spirit of Edo City is to</i>
<i>enjoy every occasion!</i>

551
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,054
<i>The next episode,</i>
