1
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:45,072
Echigoya, you are quite an evil rascal!

2
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:48,008
Omiya must be cursing your name
from the afterlife.

3
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,343
Surely you just...

4
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,747
You were the one who set up his murder
in the first place, Nezumiya, Sir.

5
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,283
I mean, after all, that was you,
wasn't it?

6
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,117
Really?

7
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,552
Is that how it went?

8
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,387
There you go, playing the innocent again!

9
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,408
To our prosperous future!

10
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:24,945
What is it?

11
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,313
Is someone there?

12
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,183
Who...
Who are you?

13
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:37,324
Like the fading echo of a temple bell,
all things in life are temporary.

14
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,061
The end of another day
marks the end

15
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,765
of another villain
and his tyranny.

16
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,466
Good evening.

17
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,136
Sacchan, the assassin has come...

18
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,638
Black market merchant Nezumiya...

19
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,674
You preyed on the weak common folk
to line your own pockets.

20
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,144
An act deserving of ten thousand deaths.

21
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:00,547
I, assassin Sacchan,
shall bring you to justice!

22
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,784
Hey, hey, hey,
I'm over here!

23
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,987
Now, prepare to die, Nezumiya!

24
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,389
What the hell did you come here for?

25
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,124
Oh, I'm so sorry.

26
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,760
But I seem to have dropped
my glasses earlier.

27
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,996
Would you mind helping
me locate them?

28
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,564
Here.

29
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,832
Oh, thank you so much.

30
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,502
Ah, now then I can see where I am...

31
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,871
being blind was better.

32
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,640
Intruder!

33
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,111
My plan has failed!

34
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,279
Retreat!

35
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,947
‐What?!
‐She's getting away!

36
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:34,915
Hey!

37
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:35,982
After her!

38
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,691
I messed up.

39
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,193
I have no choice.

40
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,327
I'll return later.

41
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,076
<i>Good morning!</i>

42
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,278
Oh, Shinpachi, eh?

43
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:06,446
Good morning.

44
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,982
Good morning.
You're up so early today.

45
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,152
You feel that way because you guys
are nothing but a bunch of slackers.

46
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:16,256
Furthermore, you lot promised that
you would pay last month's rent by today.

47
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,259
Relay that message to my
good‐for‐nothing tenant, please.

48
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,460
Uh... right.

49
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:21,561
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,898
Ah, honestly it's about
time that he got married

51
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:28,201
and started to learn a thing
or two about responsibility.

52
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,203
Yes, you're right.

53
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,472
<i>Gin getting married?</i>

54
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,142
<i>No way that could ever happen.</i>

55
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,611
Good morning everyone.

56
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,647
Where is everyone, Sadaharu?

57
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,219
They really are a bunch of slackers,
aren't they?

58
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,056
Okay, time to get up.
It's morning.

59
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,725
Hey, Gin!

60
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,528
Maya Sizitzy's morning Weather Alert
is about to...

61
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,934
What're you doing, Shinpachi?

62
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,536
Stay away!

63
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,671
Did something happen to Gin,
or what?

64
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,239
Ah, you're stopping me?

65
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,208
Does he have a straight hair now
or something?

66
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,109
Stop, Kagura!

67
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:12,179
Nothing but a world of filth awaits you
behind that door!

68
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,324
What do you want?

69
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,193
You're way too noisy.

70
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,708
Well, who is this person?

71
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,777
Well, you're the one
who brought her here!

72
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,712
Yesterday, I...

73
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,714
Oh, it's no use.

74
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,150
I can't remember anything that
happened after I went drinking.

75
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,253
Don't even try to play dumb
about the ninja cosplay part.

76
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,354
Is she a ninja?

77
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,822
Or did you role‐play that?

78
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,057
Would you just cut it out?

79
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,658
I wouldn't do something like that!

80
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,860
And if I had to choose,
I'd pick a nurse costume!

81
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,962
Are you telling the truth?

82
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,230
Shinpachi...

83
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,932
Men should have to mess around
while they're still young,

84
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,300
because if they don't

85
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,436
when they're older, they'll be
deceived by younger women,

86
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,972
or become obsessed
with weird fantasies.

87
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,506
That's what my Mommy told me.

88
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,342
Your Mommy went through a lot,
huh, Kagura?

89
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,812
I... I don't really
remember last night.

90
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,615
So tell me, did I do
anything strange?

91
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,283
No, nothing at all.

92
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,518
I see, that's really good to hear.

93
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:29,389
I thought for sure I might have done
something truly awful while I was drunk.

94
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,125
There is nothing "awful"
between husband and wife.

95
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,961
I promise I'll go along with any
of your wild desires.

96
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,963
‐What?
‐Now, my dear...

97
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,532
Look how perfectly sticky
the natto has become.

98
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,734
Say "aah."

99
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,670
That's not my mouth.

100
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,273
I don't think this is what they mean
by a feast for the eyes.

101
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,275
What do you mean,
"husband and wife"?

102
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,143
You will take responsibility,
won't you?

103
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,645
After doing what you did.

104
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,146
What do you mean "what I did"?

105
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,048
I didn't even do anything,
you said so!

106
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,283
What're you talking about?

107
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,451
We were entwined together
just like this natto.

108
00:06:58,985 --> 00:06:59,953
It hurts!

109
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,188
Like I said, that's not your mouth!

110
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,425
Hey Gin, you can't change what you did.
Just accept it.

111
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,827
Marriage is more about knowing
each other than love.

112
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,629
What are you guys talking about?

113
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,766
Your beloved Gin's about to be taken away
by some crazy natto girl!

114
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,134
This is ridiculous!

115
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,670
You're trying to trick me because
you know I don't remember anything!

116
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:17,804
Right?

117
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,105
To start with, we don't even
know each other's names,

118
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,308
so how can we talk about marriage?

119
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,312
You talk as if you don't remember
but your body cannot forget.

120
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,514
Hey, will you stop talking like that!

121
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,215
And also that's not even me!

122
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,752
If your eyesight is that bad,
put your glasses on!

123
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,454
They fell off.
Here!

124
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,056
So, that's what happened.

125
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,357
Well, my name is Sacchan.

126
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,693
Please make me a happy wife,
my husband.

127
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,094
I beg you.

128
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,429
Likewise.

129
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,897
Please be good to us, too.

130
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,399
I like having fish over meat
for dinner, okay.

131
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,435
Wait!
You're too quick to accept her in!

132
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,936
And once again, I'm over here!

133
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,640
<i>I'll lay low here for a while.</i>

134
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,242
<i>This should give me enough time</i>
<i>to throw off my pursuers.</i>

135
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,931
Looks like she's serious
about living here, huh?

136
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,733
What are you going to do then, Gin?

137
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:24,070
A serious woman like her is harder to get
rid of than the stinking smell of durians.

138
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,338
Oh, good grief.

139
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,642
In times like this, all I can do is calm
myself down with something sweet.

140
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,313
<i>He simply listens to whatever I say.</i>

141
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,048
<i>Men are such stupid creatures right?</i>

142
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,718
<i>All</i> <i>I</i> <i>have</i> <i>to</i> <i>do</i> <i>now</i> <i>is</i> <i>play</i> <i>the</i> <i>part</i>
<i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>cute,</i> <i>obedient,</i> <i>young</i> <i>wife.</i>

143
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:43,056
Hey, has anyone seen the pudding
that I put in the fridge?

144
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,361
Hey, there was some pudding
in the fridge.

145
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,963
Oh come on!

146
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,865
And I tried to hide it, too!

147
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,167
I guess I have no choice,
you little piggy!

148
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,636
What day is it today?

149
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,072
What is it?
Garbage day?

150
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,041
The expiration date on some food?

151
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,909
Oh my, you forgot?

152
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,879
It's the anniversary of when you
and I started going out!

153
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,480
But we just met a little while ago.

154
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,383
Plus, didn't your personality
just change or something?

155
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,785
Ta‐da!

156
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,953
Natto pudding for our anniversary!

157
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,690
Am I being punished for something?

158
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:21,928
Today, I've made a very special
combination of our two favorite things.

159
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,364
And now, open up.

160
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,866
Enough of this already!

161
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,372
You, after pushing yourself
on me as my wife,

162
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,774
you're going to harass my precious
pudding too?

163
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,444
The hierarchy in this
household starts with me.

164
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,978
And after that, it's sweets.

165
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:39,846
You understand me?

166
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,382
Hey!
Sweets are number two over us?

167
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,419
<i>I didn't play my hand right.</i>

168
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,088
<i>Bear it.</i>

169
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,389
<i>Bear it, Sacchan.</i>

170
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,662
You don't have to be shy about it.

171
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,197
Now eat some!

172
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:58,731
Like hell I'm eating this!

173
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,568
It's okay.
This is actually pretty good.

174
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,236
Hey, Kagura, don't eat that!

175
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,806
You're not going to eat it, so don't try
to create some kind of collaboration

176
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,708
between pudding and natto, moron!

177
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,076
Are you trying to be a producer?

178
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,744
I'll whack your head with a megaphone!

179
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,514
‐I can't believe how disgusting that is.
<i>‐This is humiliating.</i>

180
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,916
‐I want my sweets, not natto.
<i>‐I was once one of the elite spy agent,</i>

181
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,284
‐Who would mix the two, anyway!
<i>‐why should I be subjected to</i>

182
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,752
‐It's disgusting! I'll have nightmares!
<i>‐this verbal abuse.</i>

183
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,553
Now, listen to me.

184
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,957
Hey, if you can't abide by these rules,
then get out, you worthless idiot!

185
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,426
<i>But what is this?</i>

186
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,660
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

187
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,062
Now!

188
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,530
I'm going out to buy
something sweet.

189
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,432
Wait up!

190
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,133
Seriously.

191
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,635
How the hell did you end up like that?

192
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,071
Help me!
I'm trapped in natto!

193
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,708
Why are you following me?

194
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,510
And what's up with that outfit?

195
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,479
Don't you like my old fashioned good
housewife look?

196
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,448
You wanna play the typical
husband and wife game?

197
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,184
Then I'll play a jobless husband
who forgets to take out the trash.

198
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:52,785
That's not a typical husband!

199
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,589
<i>My</i> <i>pursuers</i> <i>won't</i> <i>recognize</i> <i>me</i>
<i>at</i> <i>all</i> <i>in</i> <i>this</i> <i>disguise.</i>

200
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,159
<i>Now all I have to do is play the part</i>
<i>of the cute, obedient, young wife.</i>

201
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:01,728
What's the matter?

202
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,496
Nothing at all.

203
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:06,266
Hey!

204
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,568
You were looking at that
woman just now, weren't you?

205
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,770
I want you to tell me now,
is she your type?

206
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,672
Absolutely not, moron!

207
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,175
Are you trying to make me out
to be a weirdo, or something?

208
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,544
What in the world are you
doing out here?

209
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,279
And who might you be?

210
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,747
Who might I be?

211
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,649
I should ask you who you are?

212
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,117
Gintoki?

213
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,185
You just called him "Gintoki".

214
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,620
It's not a big deal.

215
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,891
By the way, Gintoki, you said that by
today, you'd pay me the last month's...

216
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:32,859
Just a minute!

217
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,028
Don't talk to him as
if you're part of his family.

218
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:39,065
I'm sorry, but Gin already belongs
to me and me alone!

219
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,001
What's with that girl?

220
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,737
All I did was ask you to pay me
the money that I'm owed!

221
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,439
So it's alimony you want?

222
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,207
You already had your fun with him!

223
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,009
You don't deserve any money!

224
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,312
What on earth is that girl talking about?

225
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,414
You're nothing but an old flame.

226
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,716
‐Go drown yourself in your old memories.
‐Hey!

227
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,885
You really think this
is my ex‐girlfriend?

228
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,120
Then you must think that
I'm a weirdo among weirdos!

229
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,356
Listen, I'm going to kick
both of your asses!

230
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,959
Don't tell me
she's your mother?

231
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,260
Is she your mother?

232
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,363
Hey, if my mother were like this,
I'd get a big tattoo on my forehead

233
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,198
that says SHOOT ME and
put me out of my misery!

234
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,300
Do you want me to shoot
you right here and now?

235
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,704
For everything rude I've done,
please forgive me...

236
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,105
dearest Mother.

237
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,940
What is with this weird girl?

238
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,241
She, well you know...

239
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,577
she hit her head when she tripped
chasing a stray cat

240
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,745
that ran off with a fish.

241
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,982
She's a little bit of an airhead and
likes to cosplay as a random wife.

242
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,617
<i>To be treated this rudely...</i>

243
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,485
<i>and in front of everyone...</i>

244
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,520
<i>Yet why, again...</i>

245
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,990
<i>do</i> <i>I</i> <i>feel</i> <i>this</i> <i>stirring</i>
<i>in</i> <i>my</i> <i>heart?</i>

246
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,459
<i>I want more!</i>

247
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,227
<i>I want him to torment me more!</i>

248
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,031
What' in the world is wrong
with this girl?

249
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,035
Man!

250
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:52,338
You didn't put your foot down, so now
she really does plan on staying here,

251
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,106
doesn't she!

252
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,409
Isn't it about time that you showed her
how much a man you really are?

253
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,978
But I really did try to show her that.

254
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,749
<i>That man has already fallen</i>
<i>under my spell.</i>

255
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,118
<i>Men are such stupid creatures,</i>

256
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:10,123
<i>but what is this occasional throbbing</i>
<i>of my heart I'm feeling?</i>

257
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,327
I'm back everyone!

258
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,729
Oh?
Gin, do you think that she's...?

259
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,930
No don't tell me?

260
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:18,765
What?

261
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:19,666
Me?

262
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,167
No there's...

263
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,268
there's just no way.

264
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:27,507
Hello, who is it?

265
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,208
This is Sacchan speaking.

266
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,444
<i>Hello there, Miss Assassin.</i>

267
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,578
Who are you?

268
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,447
<i>Nice to meet you last night.</i>

269
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:37,116
<i>I'm so glad to hear your voice again.</i>

270
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:41,821
I think that I've fallen in love with the
beautiful assassin who paid me a visit.

271
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:43,923
Nezumiya?

272
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,127
I procured your cell phone number
from your friends

273
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,297
the ones who were sneaking
around my estate last night.

274
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,232
<i>I'd really like to see you again.</i>

275
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,701
<i>You will come, won't you?</i>

276
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:58,971
<i>The</i> <i>stars</i> <i>may</i> <i>change,</i> <i>but</i> <i>the</i> <i>importance</i>
<i>of</i> <i>one's</i> <i>friends...</i>

277
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,773
<i>well, that never changes.</i>

278
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,742
<i>Well, I'll be waiting.</i>

279
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,345
Hey.

280
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,414
I've made up my mind.

281
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,083
I'm a man, after all.

282
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,784
Even though I can't remember
any of it,

283
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,720
I can't ignore you after
what I did to you.

284
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,623
If you'll settle for a guy like me,
then, please marry me.

285
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,004
What?
Are you serious, Gintoki?

286
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,273
I see.

287
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:35,942
Then come with me.

288
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,111
Are we going to the wedding hall?

289
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,378
I don't have a lot of money.

290
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:41,681
Just a minute.

291
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,117
<i>This is my first time,</i>
<i>so please be gentle!</i>

292
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:44,984
Oh, boy.

293
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,853
I'd better watch out for women, too.

294
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,287
Shinpachi!

295
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,456
What's wrong?

296
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,491
That there!

297
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,492
What the...?

298
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,093
How long has that
hole been here?

299
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,096
Maybe Sacchan is an angel
who came down from the heavens.

300
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,902
First off, I need you to meet my father.

301
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,970
An introduction, huh?

302
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,706
Well, I've come this far,
so I might as well keep going.

303
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,675
But tell me, why do we have
to get there like this?

304
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,079
Well, I was raised in a very strict house,
so I have a curfew.

305
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,982
Wow, you guys sure have a nice,
big house.

306
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:17,517
Wait, what?

307
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:18,785
Is your father a scary guy?

308
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,052
What kind of person is he?

309
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,756
He's a dishonest, buck‐toothed loan shark
with hair all over his body.

310
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,057
What's with that?

311
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,294
Are you at that age when you don't want
to wash your undies in the same load?

312
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,897
Every girl reaches that age eventually.

313
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:35,735
But listen, try to remember, I mean,
wasn't your father your first love after all?

314
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,907
Hey, once we're newlyweds, I'm going to
change these bad attitude habits of yours!

315
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,341
I'm asserting my dominance!

316
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:43,709
Be quiet.

317
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,211
Who is that?

318
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,913
Our butler, Mr. Smith.

319
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,082
He's on the lookout because
I'm late coming home after curfew.

320
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,018
Let me go ahead and tell you.

321
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,619
I'm the type of guy
who's pretty restrictive.

322
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,855
If we get married,
I'll bind you to my rules.

323
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:57,824
Bind me...?

324
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,325
<i>What is this?</i>

325
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,128
<i>Why</i> <i>does</i> <i>the</i> <i>sound</i> <i>of</i> <i>his</i> <i>words</i>
<i>cause</i> <i>my</i> <i>chest</i> <i>to</i> <i>tighten</i> <i>so...?</i>

326
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,896
<i>I want to be bound!
Bind me!</i>

327
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,531
<i>Bind me!</i>
<i>Bind me tighter!</i>

328
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:08,968
You said that you'll...

329
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,503
you'll bind me, you said?

330
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,671
Damn straight, girl.

331
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:15,241
Staying out all night with the girlfriends
and mixers will be strictly forbidden!

332
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,176
Mr. Smith saw us.

333
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,781
Wha... What's that?

334
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:22,915
It's the assassin!

335
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,250
The assassin has returned!

336
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,185
Mr. Smith!

337
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,020
That's going too far!

338
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,756
Mr. Smith was just doing his job,
for crying out loud!

339
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,892
Looks like a lot are coming.

340
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,026
Who are they this time?

341
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,495
It's Mr. Smith B, Smith C,
and Smith D!

342
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,231
Isn't that way too many Mr. Smiths?

343
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,799
It's begun already.

344
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,167
Father is testing the groom.

345
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,102
I need you to fight hard
for the both of us!

346
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,371
Say what?

347
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:50,910
Let's go now!

348
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,479
Hey!
Don't leave your husband behind!

349
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:55,882
My report, sir.

350
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,451
The assassin woman has broken
through our security

351
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,486
and appears to have entered
the mansion.

352
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,090
Then set the traps for them!

353
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,260
And when you find them,
make sure you kill them!

354
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,427
Yes, Sir!

355
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,998
They're just like poor moths flying
into a flame.

356
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,938
They won't make it here without getting
past all the traps I've set for them.

357
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:24,043
And on the small chance they make it
we have hostages to use as leverage.

358
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,046
And then we will finish them off.

359
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,551
Your father must be really strict
for all of this.

360
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,186
I'm practically unemployed.

361
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:34,954
Think that's all right?

362
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:35,821
It will be fine.

363
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,957
As long as he can trust you
as a person,

364
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,058
I'm sure that....

365
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:43,829
Cliché!

366
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,698
‐This is so cliché, but it's coming!
‐What?

367
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,534
What the hell is going on
at your house?

368
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,869
It's a son‐in‐law test!

369
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,570
He's trying to see if we can
make it together

370
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,372
even if the path is closed off.

371
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,807
If the path is closed off?

372
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,509
But that thing is coming right at us!

373
00:17:59,145 --> 00:17:59,879
Step!

374
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:00,947
And jump!

375
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:02,415
Go!

376
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,685
It would seems he wants to test
whether or not

377
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,487
you can withstand the pressure
of taking over our house.

378
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,090
Yeah, but I think all I was doing
was running away.

379
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,493
I've been expecting you.

380
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:15,661
Who's this Smith?

381
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,629
My ex‐boyfriend.

382
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,431
He's working in tandem
with my father

383
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,466
for the purpose
of getting in our way.

384
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,635
Hang on.
You're still seeing your ex‐boyfriend?

385
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,003
I seriously can't allow that.

386
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:26,072
I said you I'd bind you to my rules.

387
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,006
I know that.

388
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,274
He's a bit of a stalker.

389
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,675
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby!

390
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,010
Hey, ex‐boyfriend.

391
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,746
Men who cling on forever
without letting go...

392
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,782
are totally unsophisticated!

393
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,318
We need to hurry from here.

394
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,319
Okay!

395
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,858
What's going on here?

396
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,060
Who the hell are those guys
chasing us?

397
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,996
‐All my ex‐boyfriends.
‐Wait, what's that?

398
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,330
You're serious?
All of them?

399
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,499
‐Are you trying to make ex‐ball team?
‐This isn't good.

400
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,035
We need to get to father quickly
and explain the situation to him.

401
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,970
All right, in that case,
you go on first!

402
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,472
And I'll catch up later on.

403
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,741
But then, what about you Gin?

404
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:04,677
In this kind of situation what kind of
husband would leave his wife behind?

405
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,879
Geez, this is hard to run in!

406
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,881
I really should've worn a suit today!

407
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,417
Well, I'll leave it to you, then!

408
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,952
Give my regards to your father!

409
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:17,023
Sure are persistent bastards.

410
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,127
Starting right now,
I won't allow you to take...

411
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,963
One more step.

412
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,766
On second thought, there's no way
I can do this!

413
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,213
Mr. Ratface!

414
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,782
There's trouble, Mr. Ratface!

415
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,284
The assassin woman has bested
each of our traps,

416
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,386
and she appears to be
heading in this direction.

417
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,422
Most of the assassins
we sent after her

418
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,356
have already been defeated.

419
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,358
That woman doesn't know
when to quit, does she!

420
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,760
Doesn't she care what happens
to the hostages we have?

421
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:58,197
Now that it's come to this deploy
every last man to stop her!

422
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,131
Get rid of them!

423
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,299
‐Yes, Sir!
‐Yes, Sir!

424
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:02,802
Mr. Ratface!

425
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,372
Their objective is clearly
to rescue the hostages.

426
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,908
I think we should tie
their friends to a post

427
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,910
and spear them to death in
order to keep them away.

428
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:12,878
Now, then, I will...

429
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,481
Oh my goodness, my glasses.

430
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,017
Hey, where the heck are
you going?

431
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:19,485
Be quiet.

432
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,088
It is only me, Sacchan is here.

433
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,157
I'll be rescuing you now,
so just play along for a while.

434
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,526
There she is!

435
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,561
It's the assassin!

436
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,129
Kill her!

437
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,230
‐Sacchan!
‐Sacchan!

438
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,398
‐Run away!
‐Run away!

439
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,366
‐Sacchan!
‐Sacchan!

440
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:43,509
Who is there?!

441
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,722
The Deadly accurate assassin!

442
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,290
Gin the groom has arrived!

443
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,558
Gin the groom!

444
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:00,726
Gintoki!

445
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:04,864
Father!

446
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,635
Let me have your daughter's hand
in marriage!

447
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,050
<i>Gin?</i>

448
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:26,819
<i>Hey, Gintoki!</i>

449
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,692
Can you forgive me Gin?

450
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,595
You see the truth is...

451
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,498
Nothing happened between us.

452
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,167
Yet you...

453
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,769
You still let me use you like this.

454
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:45,671
Hey, what're you doing?

455
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,373
I'm not even injured right there.

456
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,608
Are you listening to me at all?

457
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,143
That's enough.

458
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,077
Don't touch me.

459
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,546
You reek of natto.

460
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,650
If you can't even treat wounds like this,
no man will ever marry you.

461
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,686
You'll never be someone's wife.
See you.

462
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,655
Oh, and one more thing...

463
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,857
The next time you want my help

464
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,692
don't do all this roundabout stuff,

465
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,627
and just come over to Odd Jobs.

466
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,135
I wonder if Sacchan
has fallen in love.

467
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,238
Hard to say, isn't it?

468
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:27,780
Men really are
such stupid creatures.

469
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,051
<i>Good morning!</i>

470
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,552
Hey, Gin!

471
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:36,755
You're going to miss Maya Sizitzy's
morning Weather Report...

472
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,127
Now then, Gin, please bind me up
very tightly.

473
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:43,963
That's not what I meant.

474
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,189
<i>Oh! If it isn't Kintoki!</i>

475
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,591
<i>It's me, Tatsuma Sakamoto!</i>

476
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,027
<i>What? A spaceship is</i>
<i>about to crash?</i>

477
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,763
<i>That's certainly terrible!</i>

478
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:25,831
<i>Next time...</i>
