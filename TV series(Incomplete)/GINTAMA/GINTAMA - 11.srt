1
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,370
What?

2
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,772
So what if you're a little
bit different from others?

3
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,708
Haven't you heard the phrase,
"everyone's a little different,

4
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,076
and everyone's special?"

5
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,345
"Better to be a nerd
than one of the herd!"

6
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,914
So now quit complaining, man!

7
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,049
You are mistaken if you think
you can get by in this world

8
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,751
by blaming everyone else,
you know.

9
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,420
The truth is the world
is full of demons!

10
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,688
Look here!

11
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,256
This is what's important!

12
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,525
Yes!
That's right, calcium!

13
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,161
Just drink strawberry milk to increase
your calcium intake!

14
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,162
Cramming for exams?

15
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,330
Fighting with your parents?

16
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,499
That girl you really like?
Your smelly crotch?

17
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,235
It doesn't matter, just get your calcium
and it'll all work out!

18
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,303
No, it will not!

19
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,438
It doesn't matter how
much calcium you drink!

20
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,941
If you get hit by a car,
your bones are still gonna break!

21
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,311
I got hit too, but look at me,
I'm just good as new.

22
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,313
And it's all because
I drink this every day.

23
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,516
Who do you think you are when the
only thing you drink is strawberry milk?

24
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,751
Don't make fun!

25
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,719
I can drink coffee flavored milk too!

26
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,856
Eight hundred kilo calories a day,
plus reduced sodium.

27
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,959
It's really not that bad
for a 3 dollar meal, you know.

28
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,662
Hey that's my hospital meal, Kagura!

29
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,930
Just drink this strawberry milk,
I'll feed it to you.

30
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:44,664
Yuck!
Your breath!

31
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:45,899
It's so sweet!

32
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:46,933
What was that?

33
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,169
Gin uses his "sweet breath" attack!

34
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,973
Shinpachi sustains 99 points
of damage from it!

35
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,541
You guys shut the hell up!

36
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,244
You're bothering the other patients
on this floor!

37
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,013
There are patients here teetering
on the verge of dead or alive,

38
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,481
understand, you idiots?

39
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,418
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I'll try to keep him quiet.

40
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,820
You really are rotten to the core,
you know that?

41
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,458
<i>Doctor Gregory Home</i>
<i>will be making his rounds.</i>

42
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:21,501
Come on, you're a grown man, so
just please start acting like one.

43
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,171
You're making my stay here
harder than it needs to be.

44
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,874
No matter how old people get, the
search for their place in life never ends.

45
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,577
Would you stop quoting
inspirational posters, man!

46
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,813
<i>Daddy‐yo!</i>
<i>Mommy‐yo!</i>

47
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:33,914
<i>Hey‐hey‐ho!</i>

48
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,550
<i>Looking‐for‐ my‐own‐home in‐a‐manhole</i>

49
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,952
<i>Life's a long journey,</i>
<i>don't fall on your knees</i>

50
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,720
‐Rapping doesn't make anything better!
<i>‐Where is my house?</i>

51
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,055
‐What kind of half‐assed lyrics
<i>‐Where is my house, yo!</i>

52
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,789
are those anyway?

53
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,857
Yeah, it's true in the end..

54
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,126
Everyone thinks they can make it
big these days, you know.

55
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,863
I chalk it all up to calcium deficiency.

56
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,433
Drinking strawberry milk, huh?

57
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,670
I drank a lot of it myself back
when I was a young man.

58
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,139
Back when I had all the gals.

59
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,942
What do you think you're doing!

60
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:05,112
Yeah, there was Sara,
now she was a very good girl.

61
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,848
"Drinking so much strawberry
milk isn't good for your health.

62
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,851
Why don't you drink coffee
milk instead once in a while?"

63
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,486
Is what she'd say.

64
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,787
And then there was Anna.

65
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,155
She was totally in‐your‐face.

66
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,324
But she worried about me, too...

67
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,628
<i>It's been a very long time since I've</i>
<i>seen a "Strawberry Milkster" like you!</i>

68
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,096
<i>A Strawberry Milkster?</i>

69
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,830
Right.

70
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,234
A man who puts his pride on the line
and drinks strawberry milk like his life

71
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,670
depends on it is known far and
wide as a Strawberry Milkster!

72
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,708
No, man, I'm just the Odd Jobs guy
in a poor little town.

73
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,510
The Odd Jobs guy?

74
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,011
Well, we'd better get going now.

75
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,379
We've got work to do.

76
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,981
The Odd Jobs guy?

77
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:45,218
Man, we're such busy little bees.
After all, we do take all the odd jobs.

78
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,954
The Odd Jobs guy!

79
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,059
This is bad!

80
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,495
I think we might have just
triggered some kind of PTSD!

81
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:59,266
Just like how Hamaad didn't flinch when
he was called "Crater‐face," or "Zitzilla,"

82
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,468
but had a total freakout when
someone called him "Pocks"

83
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,737
that autumn during our second year
in middle school.

84
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,272
Who the hell is Hamaad?

85
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:08,875
Did you...

86
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,244
just say that you're the Odd Jobs guy?

87
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:15,015
That means you'll do any kind
of odd job for anyone, right?

88
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:18,251
Well, anything doesn't mean that we can
bring people back from the grave,

89
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,452
or anything like that!

90
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,423
For that, you have to request
resurrection at a church using gold.

91
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,926
There's places where they'll do it
for free but Great‐grandma told me

92
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,093
I'm not allowed to say where...

93
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:28,562
No wait, I lied, I'm sorry.

94
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,831
I shouldn't have joked around about
resurrection like this is a video‐game!

95
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,933
Oh man, I don't want my final words
on this show to be about games.

96
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,267
Oh my Gosh!

97
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,555
<i>Once again...</i>

98
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,258
<i>Doctor</i> <i>Gregory</i> <i>Home</i> <i>is</i> <i>making</i>
<i>his</i> <i>rounds.</i>

99
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:08,068
I want you to find the owner
of this hair ornament for me.

100
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,136
Why do you want to find her?

101
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,375
L‐O‐V‐and E, She was my first.

102
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,346
Hey, what's with the pickled seaweed?

103
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,881
When I have to listen to a story
I couldn't care less about,

104
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,618
eating pickled seaweed
is what calms my uneasy heart.

105
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:29,656
I've spent my whole life until now as a
bachelor, doing nothing but chasing tail.

106
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:33,860
But for some reason, the only thing
I can remember now in my old age is

107
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,362
that woman's smile.

108
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,330
Give some pickled seaweed.

109
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,431
No, not you, too!

110
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,899
Have some respect!

111
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,636
You can laugh if you want,
I don't mind.

112
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,139
An old man like me yearning
for love on his deathbed.

113
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,674
It's cliche.

114
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,843
Don't be so hard on yourself.

115
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,748
Oh, she was such a beautiful
person, both inside and out...

116
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,085
<i>She always wore this hair ornament,</i>
<i>and and she worked hard every day.</i>

117
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,954
<i>She was the talk of the entire town.</i>

118
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,956
<i>‐Hey there, Ms. Ayano!</i>
<i>‐Hey there, Ms. Ayano!</i>

119
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,126
<i>All</i> <i>the</i> <i>men</i> <i>were</i> <i>in</i> <i>love</i> <i>with</i> <i>her,</i>
<i>and</i> <i>they'd</i> <i>go</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>shop</i>

120
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,794
<i>where she worked just to see her</i>

121
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,530
<i>and</i> <i>they</i> <i>got</i> <i>fatter</i> <i>than</i>
<i>pigs</i> <i>eating</i> <i>dumplings.</i>

122
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:14,534
<i>I</i> <i>wanted</i> <i>to</i> <i>join</i> <i>them,</i> <i>but</i> <i>I</i> <i>had</i> <i>no</i> <i>money</i>
<i>and</i> <i>besides,</i> <i>I</i> <i>was</i> <i>way</i> <i>too</i> <i>shy.</i>

123
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:19,272
<i>All</i> <i>I</i> <i>could</i> <i>do</i> <i>was</i> <i>lurk</i> <i>behind</i> <i>corners</i>
<i>to</i> <i>catch</i> <i>glimpses</i> <i>of</i> <i>her</i> <i>while</i> <i>she</i> <i>worked.</i>

124
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,810
<i>Then one day...</i>

125
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,551
<i>I see you've come to visit again.</i>

126
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:33,553
<i>Come on out.</i>

127
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,322
<i>There's no need to be shy!</i>

128
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,993
<i>I</i> <i>know</i> <i>you're</i> <i>always</i>
<i>hiding</i> <i>over</i> <i>there...</i>

129
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,496
trying to catch a little glimpse.

130
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,003
<i>Those were the very first...</i>

131
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:53,306
<i>that</i> <i>Ayano</i> <i>ever</i> <i>spoke</i>
<i>to</i> <i>shy</i> <i>young</i> <i>me...</i>

132
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,709
<i>But right after that...</i>

133
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,578
I know that you're in love...

134
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,550
with these dumplings.

135
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,153
You really love them, don't you?

136
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,556
But don't tell anyone
I gave them to you?

137
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,760
<i>I</i> <i>know</i> <i>now</i> <i>that</i> <i>she</i> <i>had</i> <i>no</i> <i>idea</i>
<i>how</i> <i>I</i> <i>felt</i> <i>about</i> <i>her.</i>

138
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,762
<i>But it was probably for the better.</i>

139
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:19,899
<i>After</i> <i>all,</i> <i>I</i> <i>thought</i> <i>I</i> <i>would</i> <i>pass</i> <i>out</i>
<i>just</i> <i>being</i> <i>next</i> <i>to</i> <i>her.</i>

140
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,403
<i>Of</i> <i>course,</i> <i>I</i> <i>couldn't</i> <i>even</i> <i>swallow</i>
<i>the</i> <i>dumplings.</i>

141
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,481
Are you all right?

142
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,281
What's wrong?

143
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,016
Are you okay?

144
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,585
<i>‐As I lay there choking on the dumpling,</i>
‐What's the matter with you?

145
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,054
<i>‐it wasn't my death that I thought about.</i>
‐Say something, please...

146
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,089
<i>‐The only thought going through my head</i>
‐Say something.

147
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,491
<i>was that I didn't want her to see me</i>

148
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,393
<i>in this pathetic state ever again.</i>

149
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,761
Somebody, help!

150
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:52,232
<i>I</i> <i>pulled</i> <i>myself</i> <i>up</i> <i>and</i> <i>ran</i> <i>away</i>
<i>as</i> <i>fast</i> <i>as</i> <i>I</i> <i>could.</i>

151
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,375
<i>When I regained my senses...</i>

152
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:06,846
<i>I was lying in some alley weak,</i>
<i>tired, and covered in my own vomit...</i>

153
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,919
<i>I realized that while running away</i>
<i>in pain and panic,</i>

154
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,088
<i>I'd somehow grabbed her hair ornament.</i>

155
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,125
What I want is for you to find her for me.

156
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,860
It's gonna cost you, old man.

157
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,196
We're a top‐class operation, after all.

158
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,798
I have plenty of money...

159
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,936
I've spent all I wanted on women,
and still have some left.

160
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,908
I have no family, so I've been wondering
what to do with all of my wealth anyway.

161
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,478
If you decide to accept my request,

162
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,281
I'll promise I will leave you
my entire fortune.

163
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,049
Alright then!

164
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,754
We couldn't possibly turn down an old
man's dying request, can we?

165
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:48,555
What's with you?

166
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,824
And what's with that
crazy smile on your face?

167
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,358
Shut up, Shinpachi!

168
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,627
You're gonna take good care
of our client right here!

169
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,030
You will completely devote
your heart and soul to this!

170
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,098
What?

171
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,700
Have you already forgotten that
I am still a patient here?

172
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,202
Silence, you fool!

173
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,505
The sole purpose of Odd Jobs is
to help people in need, am I right?

174
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,208
What's truly important in
life isn't money or education!

175
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,542
It's love!

176
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:13,012
This is the problem with young people today,
they have no love or kindness.

177
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,481
What's that?

178
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,750
Since when did I become the model
of the troubled youth of today?

179
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,921
Is "fortune" better than pickled seaweed?

180
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,857
Better than a family
pack of pickled seaweed.

181
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,426
‐Wow!
‐Hey!

182
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,795
<i>A Dumpling Shop here?</i>

183
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,331
No, I don't remember it.

184
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,766
Well I heard it used to be around
here a long time ago.

185
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,901
Don't remember.

186
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,470
I can't remember nothing more
than three days ago.

187
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,305
You have the memory of a chicken.

188
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,007
Never mind that, Gintoki...

189
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,843
How about paying your outstanding
tab for once?

190
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,046
The last time you paid
was 219 days ago.

191
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:51,651
Since then, you had soy sauce dumplings
207 days ago, and syrup dumplings,

192
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,686
and tricolored dumplings
202 days ago...

193
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,854
And so what?

194
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,557
You're like one of those kids who
memorize the name of every dinosaur

195
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,626
and recite them until
the sun comes up.

196
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,194
That's not important now.

197
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,996
We're just looking
for a girl named Ayano

198
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,398
who used to work at
a dumpling shop near here.

199
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:10,537
Well, it was over 50 years ago, so
the girl's probably a granny by now.

200
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:11,971
No, no good.

201
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,908
I got no interest in chicks
over forty years old.

202
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:16,843
But never mind that, Gintoki.

203
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,978
Pay your outstanding tab
for once, will you?

204
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,916
‐The last time you paid was 219 days ago.
‐I heard that chicks think it's hot

205
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,450
when guys memorize pie.

206
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,752
For real?

207
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,455
Wait!

208
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,858
How about if I could name
all the successive Shoguns?

209
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,060
Tell me, do chicks find that hot, too?

210
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,596
Okay, here they are.

211
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,364
Your Comics and Playboy Mags.

212
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,466
Also, I couldn't reach
either Karen or May,

213
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,403
because their phone numbers have been
changed or disconnected or something.

214
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,771
I see.

215
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:48,041
Then please try calling June
and Julie next.

216
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,443
Then I want you to buy me
some fruit‐flavored milk

217
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,011
and a fried shrimp sandwich.

218
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,313
Huh?

219
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,316
A fried shrimp sandwich is best enjoyed
with fruit‐flavored milk.

220
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,884
Don't you know how anything works?

221
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,085
Apparently not!

222
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,355
Because everyone around me just
makes up all their own rules anyway!

223
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,457
So I'm waiting.

224
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,527
Well, I see three options here.

225
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,796
The first.
I read your palm.

226
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,831
Two.
I hold your hand.

227
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,033
Three.
I show Scissors.

228
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,201
So, which is it?

229
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,637
The money!
C'mon, cough it up, old man!

230
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,772
Do you know how much
I've spent on you so far?

231
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,274
Good grief, good grief.

232
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,310
All you youngsters ever think about
is money, money, money!

233
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,579
Such a very sad life you lead.

234
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,381
Money‐grubbing parasite!

235
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,086
I can't take it anymore!

236
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,354
Who does he think he is?

237
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,100
And you know what t
the most ridiculous thing of all is?

238
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,759
The Playboy magazine consists
of all type of girls!

239
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,260
So why doesn't he go
through them all?

240
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:44,263
What kind of lunatic skips pages
in Playboy magazine?

241
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,533
My God, I really can't stand
that old pervert.

242
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,535
Just spill his brains next time.

243
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,672
Some nurses might be angels,
but he makes me wanna kill!

244
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,907
It'd be a different story
if we got tips.

245
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,242
Not gonna happen.

246
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,178
His hospital bills have been piling up
for how many months now?

247
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,381
He's famous for being dirt broke.

248
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,083
Why that no good dirty, old bastard!

249
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,221
‐Why that no good dirty, old bastard!
‐Why that no good dirty, old bastard!

250
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,737
‐The money!
‐The money!

251
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,674
Well, you got me!

252
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,610
How dare you?

253
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,778
Wait, wait, wait!

254
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,948
You would stomp all over an old man's
only reason to live for a little bit of money?

255
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,451
How dare you say that
with this wrinkled face!

256
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:41,054
When the money runs dry,
so does our relationship.

257
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,955
We’re ending this agreement now.

258
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,924
And I'm taking back the comics, too.

259
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,126
I'm curious about the latest issue.

260
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,661
This hospital food, too.

261
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,064
I'm curious about the lightly
sweetened desserts.

262
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,268
So that's it then.

263
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,636
No hard feelings, eh?

264
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,814
<i>So now, you know the truth</i>
<i>about me, Odd Jobs man...</i>

265
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,551
<i>I'm not just some old pervert,</i>
<i>but I'm a very sick old pervert...</i>

266
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,855
Hannah told me that my hollow
cheeks are simply irresistible.

267
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:20,660
And who was it that said the way I sink
into the bed was very tempting?

268
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,162
Oh yes, that was Naomi.

269
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,264
You look really pale.

270
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,667
Tell me, are you about to…?

271
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,070
There's more to that dumpling story
that I was telling you.

272
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,739
Will you listen?

273
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,542
Later, I heard from some people
around town

274
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,946
that she got fired from
the dumpling shop that day.

275
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,915
<i>But it wasn't just me.</i>

276
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,352
<i>She had been secretly handing out</i>
<i>dumplings to poor kids,</i>

277
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:50,590
<i>and</i> <i>hungry</i> <i>stray</i> <i>dogs</i> <i>and</i> <i>cats,</i>
<i>every</i> <i>time</i> <i>she</i> <i>came</i> <i>across</i> <i>them.</i>

278
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,393
<i>But</i> <i>that</i> <i>time</i> <i>she</i> <i>gave</i> <i>me</i> <i>free</i>
<i>dumplings</i> <i>was</i> <i>when</i> <i>her</i> <i>boss</i> <i>found</i> <i>out,</i>

279
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,596
<i>and she was fired on the spot.</i>

280
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,033
I did a really terrible thing.

281
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,871
It's too late to apologize
after all this time...

282
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:10,243
but I wanted to at least return her hair
ornament to her before I died.

283
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,181
Actually, to tell you the truth,

284
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,918
I probably just want to see
her smiling face one more time.

285
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,687
‐Let's go.
‐What?

286
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:22,855
We're leaving then?

287
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,358
We're going to keep looking for
the owner of the hair ornament.

288
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,926
‐What?
‐What?

289
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,127
Listen!

290
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,796
Let's say you drink too much
strawberry milk

291
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:32,365
and wake up in the middle of the night
wanting to go to the bathroom.

292
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:35,234
But it's cold outside and you don't want
to leave the comfort of your bed,

293
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,236
but the urge to pee gets stronger!

294
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,071
Anguish!
Worry!

295
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,072
Struggle!

296
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,741
You make up your mind
and go to the toilet!

297
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,075
You whip it out!
And you shoot!

298
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,877
Man, that feeling of release!

299
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,647
In this very moment, you feel more
alive than ever before!

300
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:48,781
But then you realize...

301
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,584
you're not in front of the john,
you're still under the covers!

302
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,922
That warm feeling spreads between your
thighs, but it won't stop, you can't stop!

303
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,089
That's what it's all about!

304
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,958
That's a Strawberry Milkster!

305
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,127
Do you guys even understand
what I'm saying?

306
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,495
Do you understand?

307
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,096
Strawberry Milkster!

308
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,398
What the...?

309
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,399
‐Strawberry Milkster!
‐Strawberry Milkster!

310
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,700
‐Strawberry Milkster!
‐Strawberry Milkster!

311
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,068
‐Strawberry Milkster!
‐Strawberry Milkster!

312
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,236
‐Strawberry Milkster!
‐Strawberry Milkster!

313
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,437
‐Strawberry Milkster!
‐Strawberry Milkster!

314
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,672
‐Strawberry Milkster!
‐Strawberry Milkster!

315
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,006
‐Strawberry Milkster!
‐Strawberry Milkster!

316
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,708
‐Strawberry...!
‐Strawberry...!

317
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:24,951
So then, how are we gonna track down
the owner of such a basic hair ornament?

318
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,953
I have a really good idea!

319
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,890
Sadaharu, if you find her,
you can chew them up all you like.

320
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,025
Hey, thats ridiculous, Kagura!

321
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,061
What do you mean
"chew them up all you like"?

322
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,000
Who's "them"?

323
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,520
Who?

324
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,564
Don't smile at me like that!

325
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,134
It's been fifty years, though!

326
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,303
There's no way there's
any scent left on it.

327
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,471
But you never know.

328
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,041
Maybe Ayano had
some really bad B. O., it's possible.

329
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,744
Hey, now!
Could you not?

330
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,013
You're totally shattering
my youthful dreams of women,

331
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,715
you pickled seaweed girl!

332
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,551
It's okay, don't worry so much,
Shinpachi.

333
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,088
Pretty girls always smell good
by definition, no exceptions.

334
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,992
Although, a pretty girl with strong body
odor wouldn't be so bad.

335
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,227
‐Is that a fetish?
‐No, no, no.

336
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:11,998
It'd be somehow more exciting and
appealing compared to the perfect woman,

337
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,266
you know?

338
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,401
What the heck!

339
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,737
You just led us right back home, idiot!

340
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,306
Did you think you were just out
for a walk, moron?

341
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,643
What is it?

342
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,811
I told you you're supposed
to pee outside!

343
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,214
Life is a series of hit‐and‐runs, man!

344
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,251
Hey, you don't think?

345
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:33,486
There's no way...

346
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:49,769
What do you want?

347
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,071
You come to pay the rent at last?

348
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,874
Listen up fellas, I'm a creature
of the night.

349
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,810
I told you I don't work
during the daytime hours.

350
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,578
Come back when it's dark, morron!

351
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,914
No way, there's no way that she's...

352
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,449
‐Nope, no way!
‐Nope, no way!

353
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,518
She doesn't really look like an Ayano.

354
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,286
‐Nope, no way!
‐Nope, no way!

355
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,288
Hey now!

356
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,756
How do you guys know my real name?

357
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,360
What is this sudden pain in my head!

358
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,829
I can't understand what she's saying!

359
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,531
Don't you mess with me, granny!

360
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,032
No way are you the real Ayano!

361
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:23,336
Even if that was your name, it would come
with the prefix Space Battleship!

362
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,537
Hey!

363
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,739
You think that I'm made of metal?

364
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,845
"Otose" is an alias.

365
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,647
The name I go by at night.

366
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:38,017
My real name is actually Ayano Terada.

367
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:42,555
Little ants, are you out
for a nice little walk?

368
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,124
Stop trying so hard
to escape from reality!

369
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,926
Would you pay attention to me!

370
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,932
Yes, Otose here.

371
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,835
What?

372
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,436
The Odd Jobs guy?

373
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,605
Call for you from the Hospital.

374
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,207
Huh?

375
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,276
Something about an old man
taking a turn for the worse.

376
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,015
Is someone that you know in the hospital?

377
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,253
He is in critical condition.

378
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,455
I would say that he's nearing his end.

379
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,192
So doctor, he did have an untreatable
heart condition after all.

380
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:21,927
Well, you know, nurse...

381
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,797
I understand he was quite
the ladies man in his day,

382
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,999
but not a single one of them
has come to his bedside.

383
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,567
What a lonely fate.

384
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,337
In any case, as far as
the hospital is concerned,

385
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,073
we'll have one less problematic
patient to worry about.

386
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,076
Doctor Gregory Home,
his pulse is weakening.

387
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,211
Runaway horse!

388
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,883
Runaway horse!

389
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,418
Look out!

390
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,788
So sorry.

391
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,932
Your mother...

392
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,468
Hey wait, I think we ran
over something!

393
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,036
It was nothing to worry about.

394
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,107
In our honorable mission to save lives,
a few small sacrifices are nothing!

395
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,742
But I think that was a person!

396
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,776
I'm pretty sure it was!

397
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,445
‐Yeah, it was!
‐No, don't think so.

398
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:16,515
I think it was something more along
the lines of a pebble or a cotton ball.

399
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,717
You guys suck.

400
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,222
It's almost time.

401
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,459
Oh, doctor, it seems that no one
came to his deathbed, after all.

402
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,200
Old man!

403
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,602
Who are you people?

404
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,371
It's a promise between
Strawberry Milksters.

405
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,173
Here she is, old man.

406
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:51,517
Dr. Home!

407
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,585
He's conscious!

408
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,686
What?

409
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,822
Hey old man, are you listening
to me or what?

410
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,858
Hey there, what do you think
you're doing?

411
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:01,827
Every dog bites.

412
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,162
Doctor!

413
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,800
I returned the hair ornament to Ayano.

414
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,368
Can you see, old man?

415
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,373
Yes, I can see.

416
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,747
Oh, Ms. Ayano...

417
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,721
You look great...

418
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,057
with your pulled hair up like that...

419
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,426
you are really beautiful.

420
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,971
<i>Thank you so much...</i>

421
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,540
<i>for returning this to me.</i>

422
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,530
Well the truth is, I wondered where
you were taking me all of a sudden.

423
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,500
He looked really happy, didn’t he?

424
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,402
Uh‐huh.

425
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:17,803
Listen, granny?

426
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,800
Huh?

427
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,707
You didn't actually...

428
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,576
remember him at all, did you?

429
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,311
Remember what?

430
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,779
I mean you didn't...

431
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,314
Who knows.

432
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,183
Anyway,

433
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,019
why don't we stop to
get some dumplings?

434
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,357
Yeah.
Yeah.

435
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,959
A cat‐eared character
debuts! What?

436
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:23,395
<i>Are our ratings so bad that</i>
<i>we need to resort...</i>

437
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,998
<i>to cute character tropes to get</i>
<i>them back up? What?</i>

438
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,068
<i>You're supposed to be that cute</i>
<i>character? Are you serious?</i>

439
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,336
<i>The next episode...</i>

440
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:36,909
Space Battleship.
Ayano!
