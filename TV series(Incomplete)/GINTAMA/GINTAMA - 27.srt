1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:02,669
<i>And in the red corner...</i>

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,438
<i>The housewife who gave</i>
<i>up her marriage</i>

3
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,273
<i>for a life on the battlefield.</i>

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,675
<i>The Demoness Haruna!</i>

5
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,544
<i>And in the blue corner.</i>

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:13,080
<i>A former pop singing star</i>
<i>turned fighter,</i>

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,648
<i>the battling diva!</i>

8
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,283
<i>Dynamite Otsu!</i>

9
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,821
Just bring it to me from any
warehouse sales!

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,224
Hey, Otsu, go for it!

11
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,192
Go for it?

12
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,560
That's a bad idea.

13
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,528
No, she'd better stop this now.

14
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,564
Her career's going off on a tangent.

15
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,967
Otsu has been reborn as a
fighting diva whom we love!

16
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,168
Let's go!

17
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,938
If you try to do everything, you're
going to be mediocre at everything.

18
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,874
My favorite ramen shop decided
to try adding curry

19
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,710
to their menu one day and within
a week, the shop had to close.

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,546
What a bad example, Gintoki!

21
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,582
That won't be the case for Otsu.
She'll keep singing!

22
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:52,152
I can tell just by looking at her she's
going to have a very unhappy life.

23
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,754
On the other hand, Kagura...

24
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,523
you look like you don't even
care about your life at all.

25
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,426
Why do we all go after our dream?

26
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,696
It's only painful to have a dream
yet pitiful to be without.

27
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,832
Yet you try to find your way
through a difficult road

28
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,701
to make your dream come true.

29
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,603
I'm so moved and inspired!

30
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,173
What the‐ there's an intruder
in the ring!

31
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,776
‐Who is she?
‐My name is John Cenagura!

32
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,245
I'm Otsu's sidekick!
And I'm...

33
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:20,447
‐Come on!
‐Oh, no, wait!

34
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,349
Whatever happens, it's not my fault.

35
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:23,650
It's not mine, either.

36
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,018
You need to discipline her better!

37
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,420
She's off the walls.

38
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:27,688
What are you talking about?

39
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:28,655
They say a kid's personality

40
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,791
‐is set by the age of 3.
‐Haruna! Come on and fight!

41
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,759
You dumped your husband
because you...

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,028
wanted more excitement,
didn't you?

43
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,892
Wow, what a surprise this is.

44
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,561
I didn't know you guys liked
watching fighting sports too.

45
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,397
I especially like seeing
women fight each other.

46
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,299
Seeing women make
those ugly faces

47
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,735
as they grab each other
makes me crack up!

48
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,638
That's a hell of a sadistic way
to enjoy watching fights!

49
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:28,075
You shouldn't laugh at someone
who's trying their best!

50
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,743
People who interrupt matches
with their laughing

51
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,578
shouldn't be allowed to
watch fighting sports.

52
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,313
You were obviously
the only one interrupting

53
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,415
the match there, speak for yourself.

54
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,684
Anyway, why don't you
tag along with me...

55
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,519
if you've got nothing else
to do now?

56
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,089
I'll take you to a more
entertaining show than this.

57
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,091
A more entertaining show?

58
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:44,991
Yeah.

59
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,726
Come and see what
I'm talking about.

60
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,599
Hey, hey, where the hell are we?

61
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,335
It's a meeting place for the
inhabitants of the underworld.

62
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,137
There's a whole bunch
of things ordinary people

63
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,939
would never get a to see down here.

64
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,278
This is...

65
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,014
an underground fighting arena?

66
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,783
This is the Purgatory.

67
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,018
What you see before you...

68
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,926
is an honest‐to‐god...

69
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,363
Death Match!

70
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,632
And the winner is...

71
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,100
The Butcher Demon!

72
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,635
It's hard to believe.

73
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,939
How often do you get the chance to
see a real fight with real swords?

74
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,175
And when you add gambling to it...

75
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,843
damn, that's entertainment!

76
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,546
What a pleasant show to watch, huh.

77
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,881
This is sickening!

78
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,984
What are you gonna do if I can't sleep
tonight because of what I saw?

79
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,952
This is undoubtedly illegal.

80
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,455
Okita, aren't you a
government official?

81
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,857
That's why I can't do
anything about it.

82
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,559
These things always have
extremely powerful

83
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,928
political figures pulling
strings from the shadows.

84
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,164
You mean to say the government
is involved in this?

85
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:00,000
One wrong step, and it's
goodbye Shinsengumi.

86
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,435
I'm envious of freelancers like you.

87
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,572
I'm going to tell you now,
you have to understand

88
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,041
I have no intention of working
for you or your friends.

89
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,109
That's funny.

90
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,845
I thought you and I were
the same type of people...

91
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,649
The type of people to be sickened
to the core by crap like this.

92
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,450
Look over there.

93
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,755
The Butcher Demon is the
Purgatory's strongest fighter.

94
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,291
We might find something
if we investigate him.

95
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:25,859
Hey.

96
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,494
Don't worry, bossman.

97
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,329
This is my personal
favor to you.

98
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,098
But absolutely has nothing to do
with the Shinsengumi.

99
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,935
I'm the only one that knows
about this place here.

100
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,836
So, please don't dare
breathe a word...

101
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,706
to Kondo and Hijikata about
any of this stuff.

102
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,245
So what do you think?

103
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,446
Do you think is he really here?

104
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:47,814
Yeah.

105
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,516
I saw him going in.

106
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,019
I'm a bit surprised to learn that Okita
is such a virtuous man.

107
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,688
To be angered by wrong doings.

108
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,456
It doesn't matter, I hate that guy.

109
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,325
He holds a high rank within
the Shogunate police.

110
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,726
We can expect a big reward.

111
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,494
Are you just in it for the money?

112
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,431
Did you just hear someone scream?

113
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,600
You guys just stay right here!

114
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,068
Hey, Gin!

115
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,138
Huh?

116
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,676
What's going on here?

117
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,278
Thief!

118
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,679
Take this!

119
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,485
My deepest apologies.

120
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,387
I really shouldn't have done that.

121
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,324
It was such a suspicious looking ass,
and my fingers just kinda.

122
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,325
You idiot.

123
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,561
How can buttocks look suspicious?

124
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:35,996
This is bad!

125
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,497
My ass is splitting into two halves!

126
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,366
Gin, just calm down already.

127
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,834
It's always been like that.

128
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,203
And still, you're also at fault...

129
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,972
for peeking into someone
else's home like that.

130
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,775
I'm sorry, sir, we were
just looking for someone.

131
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,543
Well, sir...

132
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,479
have you seen a man
wearing a very scary

133
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,814
looking demon mask
walking around here?

134
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:55,982
A demon?

135
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,884
That's a strange thing to ask me.

136
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,953
You must be Hellboy,

137
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:03,156
here to slay the demon like
in the movie, aren't you?

138
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,792
I'm not interested in
some petty demon.

139
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,627
My target is his boss.

140
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,764
Unless he has a lot of treasure,
that's a different story then.

141
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,232
A lot of treasure.

142
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,767
The only treasure here...

143
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,602
would be those children over there.

144
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,903
‐Whoa!
‐Whoa!

145
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:17,804
Y‐Y‐You!

146
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,339
What's the big idea here?

147
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,175
No you tell me what's
your big idea here?

148
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,844
You followed me from the
fighting arena, didn't you?

149
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,413
What?

150
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,481
Then you're really the man called...?

151
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:33,119
I am Doshin, also known
as the Butcher Demon,

152
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,588
the champion of the Purgatory.

153
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,605
Hey, are you okay with this?

154
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,207
Serving us tea and all.

155
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,976
We could be Hellboy here
to slay the demon, right?

156
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,144
Are you okay with this?

157
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,047
You're having tea with a blood thirsty
fighting demon.

158
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,351
How could someone surrounded
by all of these chidren...

159
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,353
possibly be a blood thirsty demon?

160
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,954
And who are these kids?

161
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:08,888
They are...

162
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,590
all of my children, of course.

163
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,424
Oh, my!

164
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,793
You had a lot of fun when
you were younger didn't you?

165
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,061
No...

166
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,830
They were all abandoned children.

167
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,731
Orphans?

168
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:21,101
Don't tell me you're doing all that
fighting just to take care of these kids.

169
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,003
Do I look like such an
honorable human being?

170
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,339
With all this blood on my hands.

171
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,675
What are you saying right now...

172
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,743
I'm a murderer.

173
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,711
Always been, always will be.

174
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,114
Fighting was the only talent I had,

175
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,417
<i>and before I knew it, everyone</i>
<i>called me the Butcher.</i>

176
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,620
<i>I was eventually sent to jail</i>

177
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,490
<i>and had nothing to do but</i>
<i>to wait for my head to roll.</i>

178
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,160
<i>But someone had their eye on</i>
<i>me and paid to get me out of jail.</i>

179
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,195
<i>You can probably guess the rest.</i>

180
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,399
It seems like you guys are
planning to destroy the Purgatory.

181
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,001
But I would suggest that you
don't get involved.

182
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,437
Are you implying we'll just end
up as the demon's dinner?

183
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,272
That might be interesting too.

184
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,610
A demon won't attack unless someone
tries to touch his treasure.

185
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:07,113
Although, he'll do anything
at all to protect his children.

186
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,351
There's no way a demon would
say something like that.

187
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,420
You just look like a
regular father to me.

188
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,155
Could you really say
that when I'm raising

189
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,190
my children with dirty money?

190
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,592
It's not like you want
to do what you do.

191
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,928
The first time I took a child in,

192
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,497
I was just trying to
repent for my sins

193
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,400
and wash away my feelings
of guilt and remorse.

194
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:31,738
It takes more than guilt and remorse
to continue to raise a kid.

195
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,940
Isn't that right, you little brat?

196
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,410
‐Daddy, hey Daddy!
‐Give those back to me, you little brat!

197
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,111
How do I look?

198
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,146
Hey, are you listening to me.

199
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,382
Daddy?
What's the matter, Daddy?

200
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:43,550
Hey, you there!

201
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,118
What did you say to my Daddy?

202
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,120
If you hurt his feelings,
I'll kick your butt!

203
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,955
Sorry about that, kid.

204
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:51,958
Give those back!

205
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,694
I'm Odd Jobs Gin.

206
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,960
If you ever get into trouble, come see me.
I'll give you a discount.

207
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,165
Hey, Kagura.

208
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,133
Let's go.

209
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,634
Yeah.

210
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:02,902
Bye!

211
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,573
What strange people they were.

212
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,043
They were the first guests we've
ever had visit, weren't they, Daddy?

213
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,078
That's right, son.

214
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,048
They're the first and the last guests
we'll ever have.

215
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,385
The big fish just isn't
sticking its nose out.

216
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,088
All I get are the little minnows here.

217
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,024
I wonder if I went a little
overboard with it?

218
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,727
You're working hard on
your day off, I see.

219
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,366
I didn't know that you were
such a workaholic, Okita.

220
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,238
Here, here.
Please help yourself and eat up.

221
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,372
What's this?

222
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,507
Sorry, bossman...

223
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,075
but he's found out everything.

224
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,076
Not that.

225
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,244
Not that, I mean.

226
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,144
What is this?

227
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,880
Do you have some kind
mayonnaise fettish?

228
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,015
It's Hijikata Burrito Bowl Special.

229
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,951
Nobody in their right mind
wants this kind of "special"!

230
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,419
Hey, waitress!

231
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,088
Can you get me a
chocolate sundae?

232
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,390
Fine, keep eating your
sugar until you die.

233
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,324
How is it, Okita?

234
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,225
It's amazing, right?

235
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,860
What's amazing is Hijikata.

236
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,463
He can turn burrito bowl
into dog food.

237
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,664
What's this?

238
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,400
Why do I feel so defeated
after buying your meals.

239
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,802
Oh, well.
Let's get to the main issue.

240
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,438
I heard that Okita talked to you into
doing something.

241
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,907
But I want you to forget about it.

242
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,008
Huh?

243
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,645
Well it sounds as though you've heard
the whole story then, Hijikata.

244
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,580
What a responsible
government official.

245
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,983
Ignoring a crime that's being
committed right under your noses?

246
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,818
We'll take care of it eventually.

247
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,987
Hey did you just put a booger
in the Hijikata's Special?

248
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,956
You better apologize, dammit!

249
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,497
Listen, not just you but all of us will
get in trouble if we get involved.

250
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,065
Hijikata, then tell me,

251
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,634
do you already know
who's behind all of this?

252
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,571
Have you guys heard
of the Tendo sect?

253
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:48,908
<i>They're a bunch of crooks that</i>
<i>control the Shogun like a puppet,</i>

254
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,178
<i>reforming this country</i>
<i>for their own benefits.</i>

255
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,614
<i>They hold the real power</i>
<i>in this country.</i>

256
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,182
<i>The blood soaked arena...</i>

257
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,418
<i>is the Tendo Sect's Playground.</i>

258
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,353
I don't see our star fighter today.

259
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,188
Anybody seen the Butcher Demon?

260
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,289
The thing is...

261
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:07,193
he keeps finding excuses not
come to fight in lately.

262
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,063
I would guess that he's
reached his limit.

263
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,397
That's all right.

264
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,300
We've got someone new
already lined up.

265
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,637
Detective Watson.

266
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,339
I got the donuts you asked for.

267
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,040
What do you mean
Detective Watson?

268
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,909
And since when
am I called Watson?

269
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,545
Elementary, my dear Watson!

270
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,747
And you can call me Sherlock!

271
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,715
Sherlock?

272
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,950
And that makes you
my assistant, Watson.

273
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,286
I've got no time to play
detective games!

274
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,455
Anyway, how's our target, Watson?

275
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,123
Nothing's happening in there, Kagu...

276
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,524
I mean, Sherlock.

277
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,127
Gin said he'd probably make a
move within a couple of days.

278
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,895
Hey, where is Gin anyway?

279
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,964
Our boss was caught
by those creeps

280
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,566
and now he can't do anything.

281
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,167
It's totally up to us, Watson.

282
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,036
I wonder if he's...

283
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,071
getting interrogated by them.

284
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,940
Oh man, I'm getting sick of donuts.

285
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,541
I haven't had anything
but donuts for days.

286
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,277
Hey, my ass is huge!

287
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:58,945
You're fattening up, Watson.

288
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,446
You should really
watch your weight!

289
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,215
Yes, Detective Sherlock!

290
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,584
Excuse me, but I think you
should also watch your back!

291
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,520
Calm down, Watson!
Capture him!

292
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,254
Get him!

293
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,023
The donut's stuck in my throat!

294
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,792
Doshin, you...
what is this?

295
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,928
I've decided to leave the city of Edo.

296
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,731
I don't know what your intentions
are for watching me...

297
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,000
but I'd like you to let me go...

298
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,069
I know that this is a selfish thing

299
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,071
for me to ask of you.

300
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,939
but I don't want to kill
anyone anymore.

301
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,642
I don't know how many years
it'll take, but...

302
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,911
I want to become the father...

303
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,181
the father that those kids
can be proud of.

304
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,450
Doshin, I...

305
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,118
Shhhhh!

306
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,122
You should get out of here, fast!

307
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,491
Our boss told us to keep
an eye on you...

308
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,427
but he didn't give any reason to.

309
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,829
I never know what
the hell he's thinking.

310
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,231
So, we're doing whatever
we like is well.

311
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,733
I don't know what the right thing,

312
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,668
or the wrong thing to do
in this situation...

313
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,304
but I'm sure Gin would do
the same thing we would.

314
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,507
Thank you!

315
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,577
Butcher Demon!

316
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,579
Don't let him get away!

317
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,114
Kill him!

318
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,017
Let's go, Watson!

319
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,418
Right behind you, Sherlock!

320
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,959
Daddy!
Why are we in such a hurry?

321
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,427
Daddy, what is it?

322
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,664
Daddy, why are you crying?

323
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,200
I wish I could've met...

324
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,602
people like them sooner than now.

325
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,405
How naive of you.

326
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,441
Did you really think you could run
away from me, Butcher Demon?

327
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,049
It's over now!

328
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,820
I guess even The Butcher Demon
was no match against a real demon.

329
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,791
Now you're the new king of the
Purgatory...

330
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,160
Behemoth.

331
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,162
Hey, Daddy!

332
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,663
Where are we going?

333
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,833
We'll go anywhere in the world,
as long as it's with you.

334
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,402
I'd go anywhere...

335
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,604
if it's with you guys, too.

336
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:06,739
But, the truth is...

337
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,975
It doesn't seem like...

338
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,577
I can go much further
than this with you.

339
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,013
Daddy?
What's the matter, Daddy?

340
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,182
Are you crying again, Daddy?

341
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,951
Did something happy
make you cry again?

342
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,254
You cry so easily, you know!

343
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,222
You are right.

344
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,658
As always you are right.

345
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,794
I am truly blessed...

346
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,796
by all of you.

347
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,946
Man, I really hate this rain.

348
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,081
Did you really have to bring
me such depressing news

349
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,217
on a rainy day like this, you guys?

350
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,388
I'm sorry, bossman, but I figured
you should know about Doshin.

351
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,224
Sorry, Gintoki.

352
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,626
If only we'd stuck with him all the way.

353
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,995
It wasn't your fault at all.

354
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,697
He was a murderer.

355
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,934
And I'm sure he didn't expect
his life to have a happy ending.

356
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,171
I'm so sorry I got you mixed up
in this crap, bossman.

357
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,040
Let's leave things where
they are for now,

358
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,176
because nothing good will come out
of getting involved any deeper.

359
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,112
You guys!

360
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,981
Didn't I tell you not to come in here?

361
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,382
Hm?

362
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,218
Hey big bro...

363
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,854
You'll do anything for the
right price, isn't that right?

364
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,423
You're the Odd Jobs,
that does anything, right?

365
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,759
Please, avenge our Daddy!
Please avenge him!

366
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,194
Oh.

367
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,230
This is...

368
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,898
my treasure to pay you.

369
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,267
We don't have any money...

370
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,202
but we'll give you all of our treasures.

371
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,871
So, please do something!

372
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,272
Big brother!

373
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,608
That's enough, children.

374
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,042
You should go home now.

375
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,078
I already know, though.

376
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,012
Daddy...

377
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,815
<i>he was doing something bad</i>
<i>behind our backs, right?</i>

378
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,317
<i>That's why he died, isn't it?</i>

379
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,854
But he was our Daddy that
we all loved so much.

380
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,923
He was a great Daddy, you know!

381
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,293
Hey, there, little kid...

382
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,396
Is this one of those
Lucky Monster Stickers?

383
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,898
That's right, sir.

384
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,366
How do you know that?

385
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,167
Why do I know about these?

386
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,404
Because I've been collecting these
Lucky Monster stickers, too.

387
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,707
I'll do anything for
one of these stickers.

388
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,210
It'll be too late even if you
tell me you want it back.

389
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,846
‐Big Brother!
‐Wow!

390
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:27,880
<i>Hey, wait!</i>

391
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,682
Hey, Gin, are you serious?

392
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,218
I always thought you
were a whimsical guy...

393
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,320
but I guess you're just
downright crazy.

394
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,756
They're not a bunch that
a small fry like you

395
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,724
can go up against on their own.

396
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,226
You're going to die.

397
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,762
I won't cause you any
trouble on my behalf.

398
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,230
Get out of my way.

399
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,732
The truth is, I don't care if you die.

400
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,367
But I don't understand.

401
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,670
You're just going to throw
your life away?

402
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,372
If I don't go, I'll die anyway.

403
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,440
You see.

404
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,510
I have an organ that's even
more important than my heart.

405
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,145
It's invisible...

406
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:03,082
but I can tell you that it runs straight
from my head through my balls,

407
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,283
and it holds me up.

408
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,254
It's all thanks to that organ
that I can stand up straight.

409
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,257
That I can walk straight, even when
I'm bleeding and dizzy.

410
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,226
And if I stop now, that organ.

411
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,631
My soul, will tear in half.

412
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,269
My heart stopping is nothing to me..

413
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,471
nothing at all compared to that.

414
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,074
Even when I get old and
my spine is all bent...

415
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,042
my soul's gotta be straight.

416
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,979
You're gonna die just to
uphold your values?

417
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,147
Keep on dreaming, man!

418
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,850
What are you saying, then?
Aren't all men dreamers?

419
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,019
That's right, and so are all women.

420
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,321
Wouldn't society fall apart
if that were the case?

421
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,624
What will happen if all men and
all women become stupid?

422
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,425
Well I think we should go find out.

423
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,794
H‐Hey, you guys!

424
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,730
Idiots!

425
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,331
What's the matter with
all of these people?

426
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,332
Actually, I think...

427
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,934
they're all a bunch of crazy fools.

428
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,036
I mean, risking their lives
for something like this?

429
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,371
How stupid are they?

430
00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:59,438
That is so true.

431
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,273
Hey, what are you doing, man?

432
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,342
I'm sorry, Hijikata.

433
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,145
I guess I'm just another
idiot like them.

434
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,187
What fearsome strength he has!

435
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,623
It's just as we'd expect from
Behemoth of the Dakini clan!

436
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,693
No wonder he was able to take
care of Butcher Demon so easily.

437
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,897
<i>He makes samurai look like a</i>
<i>bunch of babies with knives.</i>

438
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,034
The Butcher Demon was more
foolish than I had anticipated.

439
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,604
He should have just remained
our pet and lived, am I right?

440
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,406
Huh?

441
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,740
Is that...

442
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,009
the Butcher Demon?

443
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,344
No way!

444
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,079
He was definitely killed!

445
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,381
<i>This is very interesting.</i>

446
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,183
<i>The Butcher Demon.</i>

447
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,285
<i>He's come back from the grave...</i>

448
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,254
<i>to get his revenge upon us.</i>

449
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:49,622
Human...

450
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,123
what is the meaning of this?

451
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,093
There was no mistaking that I
ended your life that night.

452
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,728
So you're the one?

453
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,996
You killed me, huh?

454
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,199
I've been so pissed off that
my soul couldn't find rest!

455
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,001
What are you going to do about it?

456
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:05,004
This is no longer a place for
a weakling like you.

457
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,472
This is my stage, now.

458
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,706
Be gone, human!

459
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,241
No, I will not.

460
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,977
The spirit of a man who lived
honest to his values...

461
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,847
lives on even if his body
turns to ashes!

462
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,048
Oh?

463
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,783
Well, then in that case...

464
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,086
I'll extinguish that soul of
yours here and now!

465
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll extinguish that soul of
yours here and now!

466
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,549
It's over.

467
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,823
He did pretty well for a human.

468
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,558
Hm.

469
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,064
Hey there, big fella...

470
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:06,999
It'll take more than that...

471
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,101
to break my samurai soul!

472
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,170
Those eyes he has...

473
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:12,605
are the real deal.

474
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:14,974
Those are the eyes of
a true samurai!

475
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,184
Hey, you!

476
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,352
Look what you've done!

477
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,954
You completely blew up
our new show, you idiot!

478
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,724
Do you have any idea where
you're standing right now?

479
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,225
Who are you, anyway?

480
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,364
What?

481
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,066
Shinpachi!

482
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,669
The Shining Shimmering Samurai!

483
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,171
Kagura!

484
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,406
The Kick‐ass Karate Killer!

485
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,841
‐Gin!
‐Gin!

486
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,209
Gin, the...

487
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,578
The, the Gambler Getting
Great Girls!

488
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:54,313
‐No way!
‐No way!

489
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,949
It's Gin the Green
Grizzly Gummybear!

490
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:57,783
No, no!

491
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,352
It's Gin the Great
Galactic Gladiator!

492
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,122
One for all and all for one,

493
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,658
the Odd Jobs Three Musketeers!

494
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,359
I've heard enough from them!

495
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,161
Go and finish them off!

496
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,097
Don't blame me if you guys get killed.

497
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,600
Following me to a dangerous
place like this!

498
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,634
As if I'd die!

499
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,070
I haven't received this
month's paycheck yet!

500
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,839
Not only for this month,
but also last month!

501
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:23,642
We didn't even have any work
last month, you guys!

502
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:26,178
Well then, we'll definitely
get paid this month!

503
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,381
Who are these guys?

504
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,019
You don't understand, do you?

505
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,121
<i>This is what you call...</i>

506
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,790
<i>a battle of vengeance.</i>

507
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,326
<i>Avenging a killer of all people.</i>

508
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,161
<i>There's nothing to</i>
<i>gain out of this.</i>

509
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,330
<i>We</i> <i>know</i> <i>that,</i> <i>but</i> <i>if</i>
<i>I</i> <i>were</i> <i>to</i> <i>do</i> <i>nothing.</i>

510
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,966
<i>I</i> <i>would</i> <i>never</i> <i>be</i> <i>able</i>
<i>to</i> <i>live</i> <i>with</i> <i>myself.</i>

511
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,767
Y‐You iditos!

512
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,136
You won't get away with this,
you realize?

513
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:54,039
Do you have any idea who's
standing right behind us?

514
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,076
Who knows, I can't even begin
to make a guess.

515
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,481
What...
These guys are...?

516
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,850
The people behind you.
That would be us, right?

517
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,586
The Shinsengumi are
always behind you!

518
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,021
Wow, you guys...

519
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,990
those are some really scary
people behind you.

520
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,258
Damn!
It's the pigs!

521
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:13,425
Let's get out of here!

522
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,194
Those monkeys are
getting cocky.

523
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,663
Oh well, in the end.

524
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,865
At least it was entertaining to watch.

525
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,004
So in the end...

526
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,106
<i>the biggest fish got away as usual.</i>

527
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,042
<i>The bad always sleep well,</i>
<i>don't they?</i>

528
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,946
It would be great if you guys
went to sleep as well forever.

529
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,415
Playing us like cards,
the nerve of you!

530
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,951
Yeah, but I came here
to help you out though.

531
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,452
Right, Hijikata?

532
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,088
I don't remember coming to help
any of these bastards.

533
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,791
But if the Shinsengumi gets
burned because of this,

534
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,193
it'll be on you guys,
you're all going to commit...

535
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,828
harakiri, cool?

536
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:50,996
‐What?
‐What?

537
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:51,864
No way!

538
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:54,566
I'd have to be high on adrenaline
to do something crazy like that.

539
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:55,634
Don't worry, you guys.

540
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,903
I'll be your second and behead
you so you won't suffer.

541
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,106
My sword might actually slip
in your case, Kagura.

542
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,409
Eww, I really think he likes me.

543
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:04,777
How annoying!

544
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,379
Okita, that also includes you,
you know?

545
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:08,881
Seriously?

546
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:09,748
Well...

547
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,417
it's time we start heading home too.

548
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,552
What are you doing with that?

549
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:14,787
Hm?
Oh!

550
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,690
I guess I won't be needing
this anymore.

551
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:29,200
It really doesn't suit you anymore, my friend.

552
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,838
You ought to live your life
smiling on that side.

553
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,067
<i>Hey, Gorilla!</i>

554
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,336
<i>Why did you and your boys have</i>
<i>to get involved with the Purgatory?</i>

555
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,439
<i>My head could roll</i>
<i>because of you guys!</i>

556
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:15,908
<i>The next episode...</i>

557
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:29,388
The sign of the Virgo,
you're dying today!
