1
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:24,825
<i>It's a d‐d‐dream...</i>

2
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,095
<i>I can't move.</i>

3
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,700
<i>It's no use.</i>

4
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:34,968
<i>Could it be?</i>

5
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,236
<i>Is this what they call...</i>

6
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,371
<i>"sleep paralysis"?</i>

7
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,672
<i>Sleep paralysis.</i>

8
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,841
<i>WhWh‐What's going on?</i>

9
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:41,875
<i>Nah, can't be.</i>

10
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,410
<i>Th‐th‐they.</i>

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,913
<i>They say this happens when a ghost</i>
<i>pins you down or something...</i>

12
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,148
<i>Ohh, I don't believe in that.</i>

13
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:49,783
<i>I absolutely don't</i>
<i>believe in that!</i>

14
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,351
<i>I'm not afraid at all.</i>

15
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,486
<i>How can I be?</i>

16
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:53,921
<i>I'm the star of the show.</i>

17
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,789
<i>People used to call me</i>
<i>the White Knight,</i>

18
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,091
<i>and crap themselves from</i>
<i>just hearing my name!</i>

19
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,493
<i>I can't be afraid of a ghost.</i>

20
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:00,661
<i>No way!</i>

21
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,298
<i>Hey, Kagura!</i>

22
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,033
<i>What happened to my voice?</i>

23
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,801
<i>I'm talking, but nothing's coming out.</i>

24
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,003
<i>Hey!</i>

25
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,806
<i>Hey,</i>

26
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,908
<i>I'm having trouble breathing.</i>

27
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,610
<i>I'm struggling to breathe.</i>

28
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,145
<i>Is it really a ghost?</i>

29
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,980
<i>Is it the ghost paralyzing me?</i>

30
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,782
<i>I take back everything I said.</i>

31
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,383
<i>I do believe in ghosts!</i>

32
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,018
<i>Hey, is someone there?</i>

33
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,386
<i>Mr. Ghost, are you there?</i>

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,688
<i>I was wrong.</i>

35
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,189
<i>So please release me</i>
<i>from the paralysis.</i>

36
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:29,990
<i>Please!</i>

37
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,158
<i>I'm begging you!</i>
<i>Help!</i>

38
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,893
<i>Just please, help me please!</i>

39
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,795
<i>Somebody help!</i>

40
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,198
<i>Oh man...</i>

41
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,700
<i>it's morning already...</i>

42
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,134
<i>I still can't move.</i>

43
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,669
<i>I can't even budge...</i>

44
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,739
<i>Am I going to be like this</i>
<i>for the rest of my life?</i>

45
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,575
<i>Mr. Ghost, please answer me!</i>

46
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,043
<i>Mr. Ghost!</i>

47
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,945
<i>Mr. Ghost!</i>

48
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,413
<i>Good morning!</i>

49
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,581
<i>Oh, it's Shinpachi!</i>

50
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:55,782
<i>Shinpachi!</i>

51
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,750
<i>Help me, please!</i>

52
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,451
<i>Shinpachi.</i>

53
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,386
<i>Shinpachi!</i>

54
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,254
<i>I'm yelling at the</i>
<i>top of my lungs,</i>

55
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,256
<i>but nothing's coming out</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

56
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,792
<i>Morning, Shinpachi.</i>

57
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,960
<i>Kagura...</i>

58
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,495
<i>‐I don't care whoever it is...</i>
<i>‐You look sleepy.</i>

59
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,396
<i>‐just save me!</i>
<i>‐Morning, Kagura.</i>

60
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,130
<i>Please...</i>

61
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,264
<i>‐save me!</i>
<i>‐Where's Gin?</i>

62
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,933
<i>‐Save me!</i>
<i>‐Is Gin still asleep?</i>

63
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:13,767
<i>Please.</i>

64
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:14,468
<i>‐Save me!</i>
<i>‐Yeah.</i>

65
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,836
<i>Hurry and get over here!</i>

66
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:19,106
<i>‐Shall I go wake him up?</i>
<i>‐Kagura, get over here!</i>

67
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,240
<i>No, don't worry.</i>

68
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,976
<i>Gin's suffering from</i>
<i>"sleep paralysis" right now.</i>

69
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,311
<i>Don't bother.</i>

70
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,312
<i>What?!</i>
<i>How did you know?</i>

71
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,246
<i>How did you know?</i>

72
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,348
<i>And why the hell won't you save</i>
<i>me even though you know?</i>

73
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,683
<i>"Sleep paralysis"?</i>

74
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,785
<i>What is "sleep paralysis" huh?</i>

75
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,154
<i>It's when you're paralyzed in your</i>
<i>sleeping position.</i>

76
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,423
<i>You're awake, but your</i>
<i>body can't move.</i>

77
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,959
<i>It's a very convenient state</i>
<i>for the animators.</i>

78
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,527
<i>Convenient?</i>

79
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:44,031
<i>It seems like all the animators are</i>
<i>taking a vacation to a hot spa,</i>

80
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,500
<i>so they are planning to do the</i>
<i>whole 30 minute episode of</i>

81
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,368
<i>"Gin Suffers from</i>
<i>Sleep Paralysis."</i>

82
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,737
<i>What?</i>

83
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,945
You can't do that!

84
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:00,981
Oh, wow!

85
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,682
I'm free from the
sleep paralysis...

86
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,085
Listen, animators!

87
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:08,088
Did you really think you can get
away with this you lazy bums!

88
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,491
Now you guys, to do your
jobs more seriously!

89
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,955
Ahh Ahh Ahh choo!

90
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,823
Ahh choo!

91
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,525
Achoo‐choo train!

92
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,294
A choo choo train is kinda
pushing it...

93
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,495
That was a sneeze.

94
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,296
A chewing gum!

95
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,164
A chihuahua!!

96
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,131
Cut it out!

97
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,900
Sneeze normally!

98
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,501
My nose won't stop itching!

99
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,804
This pollen this year is worse than
the last few years combined...

100
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,875
<i>All the people in the city are turning</i>
<i>into snot balls from the hay fever.</i>

101
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,744
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

102
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,679
It's not the cedar pollen this year.

103
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,814
They say...

104
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,950
<i>it's a pollen from a nasty plant</i>
<i>that's growing on some planet.</i>

105
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,151
<i>A Chewbaccall!</i>

106
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:18,852
Hey, Gin!

107
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,787
That doesn't even sound
like a sneeze!

108
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,789
They say you gotta watch out for...

109
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,191
‐A Chupacabra!
‐A Chupacabra!

110
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,061
A legendary creature that sucks
the blood of farm animals.

111
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,864
I don't need to know about
some urban legends right now.

112
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,932
Urban legend, you say?

113
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,100
I heard that even the
old hag downstairs

114
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,269
closed the shop up
and is bed ridden.

115
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,704
Otosé in bed?

116
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,239
The invincible Otosé in bed,

117
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,474
Otose, who would more likely
have pollen for cereal

118
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,175
every morning?

119
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,443
That old hag Otosé?

120
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,711
I know it's shocking,

121
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,846
but that's how nasty
the pollen is this year.

122
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,082
We should all probably
stay indoors then.

123
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,850
Oh, we're out of tissues...

124
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,452
Shinpachi, go and buy some more.

125
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,688
Hey!
Were you even listening to me?

126
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,089
Just shut up and go buy some.

127
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,391
Buying boxes of tissues is the
only thing you're good at.

128
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,026
What did you say,
runny nose brat!

129
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,328
Go home to your planet!

130
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,565
Staying inside or going outside,
it doesn't seem much different.

131
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,168
Where the hell is this
pollen coming from?

132
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,104
It might be coming
from someplace nearby.

133
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,506
But there aren't many plants in
Kabukicho...

134
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,843
Whatttaaaaaaaa!

135
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,649
Hey, are you still alive?

136
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:28,855
What?

137
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:29,823
What's that?

138
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,124
I'm seeing things?

139
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,527
Shinpachi, someone's here.
Get the door.

140
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,462
Are you crazy?

141
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,397
You can't order me around
like that!

142
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,665
Just get the door.

143
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,934
Greeting guests is the
only thing you're good at.

144
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,302
You piss me off!

145
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,604
You can win the Miss
Piss Me off Contest!

146
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,705
Nobody's home.

147
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,374
We're pretending we're not home.

148
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,842
What an attitude.

149
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,511
<i>Coming, coming,</i>
<i>I'll be right there...</i>

150
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,146
Damn, why is it always me?

151
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,494
Hello, how do you do?

152
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,064
I just moved in next door
behind your house...

153
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,633
My name is Hedro.

154
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,905
Yes, my name is short for
"Heads will Drop and Roll."

155
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,274
Hedro!

156
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,816
I've come here today
to introduce myself.

157
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,952
I run a flower shop
called Hedro's Forest

158
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,122
so please accept this as,
a token of my goodwill.

159
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,992
I may cause you some
trouble sometimes,

160
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,661
but I really hope that
we can get along...

161
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,397
Alright, sorry to bother you.

162
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,456
<i>Scary!!!</i>

163
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,024
<i>Scary!!!</i>
<i>I'm shaking!</i>

164
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:11,858
<i>What was that?!</i>

165
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,660
<i>Our neighbor Hedro is</i>
<i>freaky scary!</i>

166
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,129
You think, maybe, that's Hedro's
Forest over there?

167
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,063
What's with that?

168
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,632
It's releasing all kinds
of pollen into the air...

169
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,236
Well, this explains why Edo City's
having the worst hay fever ever.

170
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,305
And no wonder no one's doing
anything about it.

171
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,273
If you complain, your head
will drop and roll!

172
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,643
Hey, hey, why did that monster
have to move in next door?

173
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,445
But he said he was a florist.

174
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,047
Don't be ridiculous!

175
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,415
Just look at his evil face!

176
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,517
Anyone can tell he's come
to take over the earth!

177
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,219
<i>During the day, he's a florist.</i>

178
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,187
<i>But at night, he's plotting</i>
<i>to take over the world.</i>

179
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,424
<i>He's much worse than a "good girl</i>
<i>during the day, party girl at night."</i>

180
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,293
He intends to conquer the
Earth after weakening

181
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,795
everyone with his pollen.

182
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:49,996
Seriously?

183
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,031
Oh!

184
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,534
<i>Come</i> <i>to</i> <i>think</i> <i>of</i> <i>it,</i> <i>didn't</i> <i>he</i> <i>leave</i>
<i>a</i> <i>potted</i> <i>flower</i> <i>right</i> <i>over</i> <i>there?</i>

185
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,007
Sadaharu!

186
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:03,810
Sadaharu!

187
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,011
Come here quickly!

188
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:05,712
It's going to explode!

189
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,080
What?
It's gonna explode?

190
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,782
Forget about Sadaharu.

191
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,150
If we don't hurry,
the poison gas will...

192
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,684
What?
Poison gas now?

193
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,052
Sadaharu!

194
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,422
I can't let him just die like that!

195
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,290
Just like flowers in a storm.

196
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,758
Life is full of goodbyes.

197
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,064
I brought the
Neighborhood Newsletter.

198
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,100
For god's sake, Catherine!

199
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,169
This is no time to be reading
Neighborhood Newsletter!

200
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,604
The earth's about to be taken
over by that monster!

201
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,607
Did your runny nose go
up into your brains...

202
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:35,909
you morons?

203
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,312
What?

204
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,147
Gin, this is so bad!

205
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,784
The next house on this list
is our neighbor Hedro!

206
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,020
You're kidding.

207
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,331
He really is a florist.

208
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,000
Who'd come to such
a scary flower shop?

209
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,203
But he seems to be having
so much fun.

210
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,072
He doesn't look at all like he's
here to conquer the Earth.

211
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,440
Of course he's happy.

212
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:08,908
He's growing devil flowers

213
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,511
that will be the vanguard troops
to conquer the Earth.

214
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,513
More importantly, how are
we gonna pass him

215
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,814
the Neighborhood Newsletter?

216
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,216
‐Rock!
‐Paper!

217
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,250
‐Scissors!
‐Scissors!

218
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,986
No way, on me?
Come on!

219
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,322
You don't have to hand
it to him personally.

220
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,324
You don't have to risk
your life for this.

221
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,526
Act like Passerby A...

222
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,795
and leave the Newsletter
as you walk by.

223
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,396
Uh, wait.
Wait a minute!

224
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,566
There's no Passerby A,
or B or C or D.

225
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,735
Everyone's too scared
to pass by that shop.

226
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,404
Passerby A will clearly stand
out big time.

227
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:39,973
Don't sweat it.

228
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,908
There will be other passersbys.

229
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,512
Wawa!

230
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,248
Wawa!

231
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,016
Wawa!

232
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,485
Hey, you guys are too outstanding
for a passerby!

233
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,420
Oh crap!
Hedro's watching.

234
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,722
Hedro's looking right at them!

235
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,625
B C, he's watching you,
Passerby B and C!

236
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,262
Oh God, please save us!

237
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,098
After losing my wife,
my son only says.

238
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,032
Wawa!

239
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,067
And no other words at all...

240
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,102
Wawa.

241
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,204
When he says "Wawa," he actually
means daddy.

242
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,073
After losing his mother, he has
no one but me to rely on...

243
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,542
It can't be helped.

244
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,077
But what will I do if he doesn't
learn any more words?

245
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,412
When he grows up and says...

246
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,515
Wawa!
Wawa, Wanna Chihuahua?

247
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,951
What?
Say‐say‐say that again?

248
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,186
It's impossible to get
by at this rate.

249
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,489
But I wonder if
I should fix it.

250
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,558
It feels good to be called "Wawa."

251
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,293
But he must think I'm wonderful!

252
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,761
The one and only Wawa!

253
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,262
<i>Father didn't know.</i>

254
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,131
<i>Daijiro's only word,</i>

255
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,399
"Wawa,"

256
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,535
<i>did not mean "daddy," but actually</i>
<i>comes from words his</i>

257
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,072
Mother had often said to his Father,
"What a Worthless Worm!

258
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:46,873
<i>Work!"</i>

259
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,708
<i>That's what "Wawa" meant.</i>

260
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,611
<i>It has nothing to do with</i>
<i>Daijiro loving his father</i>

261
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:52,645
or anything like that...

262
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,746
Wawa!

263
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,249
We don't need any of that
superfluous storyline!

264
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,151
Is Hedro crying?!

265
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,820
I can't quite tell,
but now's my chance!

266
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,790
Here's the
Neighborhood Newsletter!

267
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,396
We're in big trouble,
huge trouble, mega trouble.

268
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,597
He's sharpening his knife.

269
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,599
Our heads will drop
and they'll roll...

270
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,834
Wawa.

271
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,136
Will we be swallowed up, Wawa?

272
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:55,008
My, I appreciate all three of you
coming all the way out here

273
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,076
just to bring the
Neighborhood Newsletter...

274
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,546
Please make yourselves
at home while I

275
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,116
just prepare something
for you to snack on.

276
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,318
<i>Making a snack?</i>

277
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,986
<i>He's going to snack on us!</i>

278
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,588
<i>He's definitely going to</i>
<i>snack on us!</i>

279
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,089
Uh...er...um...

280
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,025
Mr. Hedro , I mean,
Master Hedro...

281
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,327
No, just plain Hedro is fine.

282
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,094
Uh...

283
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,596
I'm so sorry about earlier.

284
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,031
When I hit you
with the newsletter.

285
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,066
My sandal thong
suddenly broke and,

286
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,068
I know this sounds like an excuse,
but it's the truth.

287
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,503
No, forget it.

288
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,138
It was an accident.

289
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,439
An accident.

290
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:27,640
More importantly,

291
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,044
don't they say a sandal
thong breaking is a bad omen?

292
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,981
I truly hope that nothing at all bad
happens to you because of that.

293
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,183
<i>He's about to do</i>
<i>something bad to us.</i>

294
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,686
<i>‐He's about to bring us bad omens.</i>
<i>‐He's about to bring us bad omens.</i>

295
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,688
Uh, uh, Master Hedro?

296
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,423
I mean your highness Hedro!

297
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,525
No, just Hedro will do.

298
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,394
Uh, well, we appreciate you
welcoming us,

299
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,196
but I just got a call
that my father

300
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,298
is in critical condition, so we have
to leave immediately...

301
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,466
What is that?

302
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,535
Why didn't you say so sooner?

303
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,204
I'm concerned about him now, too.

304
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,039
Would you mind if I come along?

305
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,708
<i>He plans on coming with us!</i>

306
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,409
<i>He plans to follow us to hell...</i>

307
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,411
<i>and put us all in critical condition.</i>

308
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,313
Uh...
no, it's all right.

309
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,881
He was a rotten father anyway.

310
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,316
What?

311
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,484
Is that so?

312
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,786
And just when I thought I'd bring
some of my flowers

313
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,054
as a get‐well gift.

314
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,823
No, really, it doesn't matter.

315
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,592
In fact, I'm rather looking forward
to his funeral.

316
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,827
Is that so?

317
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,730
By all means, please use
my flowers for the funeral...

318
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,734
I grew these flowers with all
my heart and soul.

319
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,570
And so I'm sure they'll
lead your father to Heaven.

320
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,271
<i>He will definitely lead us!</i>

321
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,241
<i>Not just his father,</i>
<i>but this entire planet.</i>

322
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,909
<i>Will be lead to Heaven!</i>

323
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,880
Umm, Mr. Hedro, why did you
become a florist?

324
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,616
It doesn't suit me, right?

325
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,418
No, that's not what I meant...

326
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,620
It's all right.

327
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:48,955
I'm fully aware of it!

328
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,491
Especially because
of the way I look...

329
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,228
I've always wished
I could be a flower.

330
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,163
‐Oh?
‐Oh?

331
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,134
People always feared me because
of the way I look.

332
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:06,305
So I wished at least for my heart will
be as beautiful as a flower...

333
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,077
That's why I want to be as
close as possible to flowers.

334
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,114
But it seems it doesn't
suit me, after all...

335
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,683
I haven't had a single
customer yet...

336
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,987
Mr. Sakata,
you and your friends

337
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,990
are the only ones around
who aren't afraid of me.

338
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,458
<i>Sorry, but...</i>

339
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,026
<i>We're actually terrified of you...</i>

340
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,461
Gin...

341
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,397
Do you think maybe Hedro
is actually a nice person?

342
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,665
No way.

343
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,333
This is the "Gap Rule."

344
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,434
The "Gap Rule"?

345
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,738
Whenever a guy always
trying to look bad

346
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,773
does somethingnice
once in a while,

347
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,575
his impression
shoots straight up.

348
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,243
On the contrary,

349
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,280
when someone who is normally
nice does something a little bit bad,

350
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,915
he seems like a great villain...

351
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,484
That's the "Gap Rule".

352
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,319
Really Is that what
you think of me?

353
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,822
That makes me look like
a devil in human skin!

354
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:59,225
That means that
Hedro is actually...

355
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:01,994
Wrong!

356
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,596
<i>He looks so hungry!</i>

357
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,665
<i>He's having a Meow Burger</i>
<i>for dinner tonight!</i>

358
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,733
You guys are too easily fooled

359
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,569
when his appearance
doesn't match his actions.

360
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:10,937
You need to be smart!

361
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,072
"You can't trust a book
by its cover"

362
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,974
is something that
only stupid people say.

363
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,009
But you need to believe
in your first impressions...

364
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,245
Trust in your inspiration!

365
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,113
Stimulate your imagination!

366
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,715
Okay, Kagura!

367
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,451
What do you think will be in
that pot in just a few hours?

368
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,454
Uh...It will be filled with
delicious steamed rice?

369
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,622
You're wrong!

370
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,657
This is why I'm telling
you you're so naive!!

371
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,992
I'll show you the answer!

372
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,165
Oh!
I think it's just about ready.

373
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,237
Now, did you see it?

374
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,338
Could you see it?

375
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,706
What did our future look like?

376
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,607
It's pitch black.

377
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,342
Headlights will do
you no good!

378
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,344
Forgive me for keeping
you waiting.

379
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:52,778
I'm not very good at this.

380
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,081
No, no, no take your time.

381
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,482
Take forever if you want.

382
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,619
Well then, feel free to
lie down and rest...

383
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,589
Just relax and make yourselves
right at home here...

384
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,692
When I'm ready,
I'll wake you up.

385
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:07,927
<i>Shinpachi!</i>

386
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,096
<i>You know what'll happen</i>
<i>if we fall asleep?</i>

387
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,666
<i>If we fall asleep, we'll be attacked</i>
<i>and end up in the miso soup!</i>

388
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,101
‐Hey!
‐Hey!

389
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,738
The more you say not to fall asleep,
the sleepier I become...

390
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,307
It's like the study night before
a big exam!

391
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,309
If you're aware of it,
don't fall asleep!

392
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,245
We have no time to lose at all.

393
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:30,216
I'll create a diversion to draw his
attention while you run like hell!..

394
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,250
But Gin...

395
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,351
Look at that.

396
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,253
That is...

397
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,557
He's using the comic to adjust
the height of his fridge?

398
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:42,528
A comic stirs the dreams and
adventurous spirit of all men...

399
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,598
Anyone who treats
comic books like that...

400
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,400
is definitely evil!

401
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,335
What kind of analysis is that?!

402
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,837
Yaaaaaaaaaah!

403
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,954
is definitely evil!

404
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,655
What kind of analysis is that?!

405
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,804
Are you all right, Mr. Sakata?

406
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,540
That was very close.

407
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,676
You were just about to step
on a ladybug.

408
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,511
Killing is wrong.

409
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,018
Oh, watch where you're going,
you two...

410
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,822
You two nearly knocked over
these potted flowers...

411
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,458
I told you that Killing is wrong.

412
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,228
Give me inner strength...

413
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,764
Give me inner strength...

414
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,834
Hedro!

415
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,603
We're not letting you
take over the Earth!

416
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,441
Gin, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

417
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,142
I'm a coward.

418
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,112
All I can think of is sacrificing
you so I can survive.

419
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,880
Get out of my way!

420
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:12,051
I can't be worrying about others
when my own life is at stake!

421
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,653
That's totally cruel!

422
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:17,890
Just tell him, "Gin, I'll live your
share for you, so rest in peace"!

423
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:19,658
You're sinister.
Sinister, I say!

424
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,495
He's coming!

425
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,462
He's coming!

426
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,498
Which means that
Gin is already...

427
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,034
Gin ?

428
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,668
What about the Earth?!

429
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,137
Weren't you going to
protect the planet?

430
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,571
My life comes before Earth!

431
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,773
What's with that?!

432
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,279
What's with this house?!
Where's the exit?

433
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,749
It's a trap.
The entire house itself is a trap!

434
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:44,717
Over there!

435
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:45,951
Head over there!

436
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,488
Ow ow...

437
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,091
What's the matter, Shinpachi?

438
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:53,492
Look over there.

439
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,197
An altar!

440
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,331
It's an altar is, isn't it?

441
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,801
It's an altar to make sacrifices,
right there.

442
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,236
No way!
I don't want to die yet!

443
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,238
But why is there an altar here?

444
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,640
It's so obvious, you idiot!

445
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,509
It's to make a pact with the Devil
and gain eternal life.

446
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:11,544
That's right.

447
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,379
To gain an eternal wife!

448
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,883
Mr. Sakata, where did you go?

449
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,619
That's very odd.

450
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,122
I thought I heard noises
from around here...

451
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,460
I guess I was wrong.

452
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,994
I have to find them quickly.

453
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,363
So if they're not here...

454
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,208
I found you three at last.

455
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,676
Run!

456
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,211
‐No!
‐No!

457
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,947
I don't want to die a virgin!

458
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:49,281
Shinpachi!

459
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,984
If you sacrifice yourself,
everything will be okay!

460
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,186
What?!
You don't get to decide what I do!

461
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,088
We'll live your life for man!

462
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,124
You're saying the same thing,
you prick!

463
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,525
Wait!
He's coming!

464
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:03,062
Climbing up, climbing up, climbing up!

465
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,897
‐Then go down!
‐Go by yourself!

466
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,465
You guys are like the devil!

467
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,235
‐That's the real devil back there!
‐Please just wait!

468
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,270
‐The devil!!
‐The devil!!

469
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,074
Look there!

470
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,175
A way out!

471
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,781
Where are we?

472
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,985
Was‐was the tower always
this high?

473
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,553
Mr. Sakata!

474
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,992
Well, I finally caught up with you.

475
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,499
Shinpachi.
Kagura.

476
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,568
It's been nice knowing you...

477
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:43,669
Gin

478
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:44,904
But Gin...

479
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,040
If the three of us team up,
then we'll have a chance.

480
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,775
Let's end this right.

481
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,510
Let's protect the city of Edo...

482
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,878
and the Earth.

483
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:53,946
You're right.

484
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:56,582
That's the one last thing
the three of us can do.

485
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,552
‐Let's go!
‐Okay!

486
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,522
Oh, a drone beetle...

487
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,607
Thank goodness!

488
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,409
Are the three of you okay?

489
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,345
‐Yes.
‐Yes.

490
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,147
<i>‐Thank you very much.</i>
<i>‐Thank you very much.</i>

491
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:33,052
<i>And from that day on...</i>

492
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,187
<i>the Earth continued</i>
<i>not to be taken over...</i>

493
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,655
<i>and peace remained...</i>

494
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,325
<i>And in the streets of Edo City,</i>

495
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,360
<i>the pollen continued</i>
<i>to swirl about...</i>

496
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,396
<i>If there was one thing</i>
<i>that did change...</i>

497
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,999
Ahh, Ahh, Achoo!

498
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,834
‐Anchovy!
‐A chocolate!

499
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,536
‐Achoo!
‐A choice!

500
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,770
A charity!

501
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,005
Bless you!

502
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,640
Press you!

503
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,641
<i>‐Achoo!</i>
<i>‐For a while,</i>

504
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,476
<i>the only sound that</i>
<i>could be heard...</i>

505
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,744
<i>from noisy Odd Jobs...</i>

506
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,379
<i>was the sounds of sneezing.</i>

507
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:08,420
May I help you?

508
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,014
Uh, it's so annoying!

509
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,850
<i>Why do I keep running into that</i>
<i>jerk everywhere on my day off?</i>

510
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,251
<i>The next episode...</i>
