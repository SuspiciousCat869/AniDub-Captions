1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,637
<i>The land of the samurai.</i>

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:05,472
<i>There was a time,</i>
<i>a long time ago</i>

3
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,574
<i>when our country</i>
<i>was called by that name.</i>

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:11,011
<i>With the arrival of the "Amanto",</i>
<i>or Sky People from outer space</i>

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,413
<i>and the Sword Ban</i>
<i>enacted 20 years ago</i>

6
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,549
<i>the samurai class fell into decline.</i>

7
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:20,254
<i>In these hard times there was one man</i>
<i>left with the spirit of the samurai.</i>

8
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,356
<i>His name is Gintoki Sakata,</i>

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,891
<i>a reckless jack of all trades</i>

10
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,959
<i>with a serious sweet tooth</i>
<i>and big heart.</i>

11
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,061
<i>Due to some rather</i>
<i>unexpected events,</i>

12
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,831
<i>I, Shinpachi Shimura,</i>
<i>ended up working with him,</i>

13
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,165
<i>for a while at least.</i>

14
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,968
<i>What is the true nature</i>
<i>of this man's soul?</i>

15
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,671
<i>It's very difficult to tell,</i>
<i>but though dim,</i>

16
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,540
<i>I think it's definitely glistening.</i>

17
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,534
<i>Hey, Gintoki!</i>

18
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:19,239
It's about time that you pay off
the accumulated rent that you owe me!

19
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,474
Hey, Otose!

20
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,442
The other day I fixed
your VCR, remember?

21
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,877
That oughta be enough
to square us!

22
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,045
Square us?
As if!

23
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,180
That's not even close
to being enough for five months!

24
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,050
And the VCR broke again, so I couldn't
finish watching all the episodes

25
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,251
of "The Ed Sullivan Show!"

26
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,352
You idiot, don't ever give up!

27
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,987
I'm sure they'll air it on TV again!

28
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,057
You'd better just shut your yapping
and pay me the rent that you owe,

29
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,392
you mop headed oaf!

30
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,593
Get off my back!

31
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,494
You don't understand
the suffering

32
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,162
that people with mop tops
have to go through!

33
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,797
As if I care, moron!

34
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,899
‐If you don't have any money to pay me...
‐They're at it again

35
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,567
...then sell one of your kidneys or
your testicles or something!

36
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:51,238
<i>Sometimes I wonder if it's a good idea</i>
<i>to continue hanging around this man.</i>

37
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,507
‐You're borrowing money from this dirty old hag!
‐Hey come on, stop it, you two.

38
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,175
So then, what does that make you?

39
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,177
Aaaaaagh!

40
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,312
Uh?

41
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:04,284
‐Hiyeah!
‐Whoa!

42
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,324
<i>"Sometimes" is an understatement.</i>

43
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:32,379
Inoue, I hear that you've been making
quite a mess of things lately, huh?

44
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,381
Is that so?

45
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,584
I'd go on a real rampage,
but I've been holding back lately,

46
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,921
because there's this annoying bunch
that's always in my face crying.

47
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,289
Listen up, moron.

48
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,459
There is only one thing that's waiting
for the people who don't understand

49
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,228
what it means to show
respect in this world.

50
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,529
Hold back a little.

51
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,998
I'm telling you
for your own sake, man.

52
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,500
I don't think I understand.

53
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,204
Tell me, what exactly are you saying
is waiting for me if I don't hold back?

54
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:00,707
You'd better know your damn place,
you little tight permed nuisance.

55
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,844
Don't you know what kind of
damn situation you're in right now?

56
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,480
I don't expect some chump
like you with a crew cut

57
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,949
to understand the artistry
of these tight perms.

58
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,718
You clean cut cretin should just
stay on the sidewalks

59
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,853
and stay out of the way,

60
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,088
and then maybe you wouldn't
have to get hurt!

61
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,958
What the hell you said?

62
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,926
You got a problem
with crew cuts, dirtbag?

63
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,662
Master, please, if you will.

64
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,903
Sorry to say.

65
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,271
You are all dead.

66
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:54,494
Wow, someone really made a mess
of things here, didn't they?

67
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,595
That's true.

68
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,932
I don't really care what happens
to a bunch of crooks like these.

69
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,102
But I do wonder
who did them like that.

70
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,612
Oh, darn it!

71
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,482
Today's the day the new
comic book comes out!

72
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,118
I totally forgot that this week
it comes out earlier than usual!

73
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,486
Should we turn back?

74
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,687
No, forget it, man.

75
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,923
We've already got the groceries
to make our hotpot.

76
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,357
Yeah, you're right,

77
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,860
and this might be a good chance
to give up this crazy habit.

78
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,196
I mean, reading comic books
at my age...

79
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,935
No, but men are always boys
at heart until they die.

80
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:38,672
I'm sorry, but could you keep your
embarrassing emotional problems to yourself?

81
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,307
‐Hey, look out!
‐Huh?

82
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,717
Oh my God,
you ran her over!

83
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,785
What're we gonna do
about this?

84
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,920
Why weren't you
paying attention to the road?

85
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,355
Don't get so worked up.

86
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,225
Chill out and help me
find a t... time machine.

87
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,926
No, you chill out!

88
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,828
It... it should be okay,
you know?

89
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,931
A fortune teller I saw on TV said
people with my horoscope

90
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,433
would be lucky this weekend.

91
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:10,103
I'm sure that she is
miraculously unharmed, okay?

92
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,472
Hey there, young lady, hello.

93
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,010
Oh, those freaking psychics!!!
Liars!

94
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,812
I'm never watching
any of their shows again.

95
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,948
Darn it! Why do they always
have to be so convincing?

96
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,650
Hey, how is she doing
back there?

97
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,353
She's not even twitching at all.

98
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:29,055
Darn it, then we need
to get her to a doctor!

99
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,091
Huh?

100
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,228
Wait, what in the world...?

101
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,799
Huh... ooooh!
Huh?

102
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,805
You guys stupid
or something?

103
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,941
I'm not going to die just from
getting run over by motor scooter!

104
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,110
This scar's from getting shot
by those guys.

105
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,279
‐Already closed up, see?
‐How come?

106
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,682
Did you eat glue with all of
your meals or something?

107
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,517
Whatever.

108
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,619
You seem all right,
so we'll be on our way.

109
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,087
Get well soon!

110
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,193
Huh? Shinpachi, did you suddenly
put on some weight?

111
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,761
How could a grown up
man like you

112
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,930
abandon a girl who's being hunted
by the mafia?

113
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,100
Because I'm still a boy
at heart, ask him.

114
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,636
And besides, in this country
we don't call people strong enough

115
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,238
to stop a scooter
with one hand "girls".

116
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,107
We call them mountain gorillas.

117
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,409
Hey! There they are!

118
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,644
Over here!

119
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,979
Oh, no!
This is bad!

120
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,781
Wait! Who are they?

121
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,816
Are they pedophiles?

122
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,017
What, potato pies?

123
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,287
Stop right there!

124
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:12,992
Hey, who are you?

125
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,927
And what are you?

126
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,396
What did you do with your super
strength to make them so angry?

127
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,498
I heard that...

128
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,700
I heard that

129
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,203
I could earn some sick cash
if I came to the Capital.

130
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:26,639
And so traveled all the way to
Edo City from a distant planet.

131
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,442
<i>My family...</i>
<i>well, they're very poor.</i>

132
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,679
<i>Nothing but white rice</i>
<i>for every meal.</i>

133
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,684
I mean, I'd like to at least be able
to eat an egg with my rice.

134
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,919
Well, that's not much better.

135
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,654
But then one day,

136
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,157
<i>the mafia made me an offer.</i>

137
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,565
<i>Care to change your life</i>
<i>by coming with me?</i>

138
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,836
<i>If you do, you can have some soup</i>
<i>with your rice three times a day.</i>

139
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,608
Well, I heard that and
jumped at the opportunity.

140
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:02,642
Why in the world?

141
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,445
I mean, at least eat something
different for each meal!

142
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:11,818
The thing is, I'm actually really sturdy
compared to Earthlings.

143
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,487
<i>So of course I took their offer</i>

144
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,923
<i>and I had rice with soup</i>
<i>every single day.</i>

145
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,425
<i>I was so happy.</i>

146
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,902
But recently, their demands
have been "escalator."

147
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,670
Uh, you mean "escalating."

148
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,272
The last assignment
they gave me,

149
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,340
they told me to get
someone's testicle balls.

150
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,010
No, not testicle balls,
just balls is fine.

151
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,344
Just balls.

152
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,213
I don't like being here anymore.

153
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,315
Edo City is very dodgy.

154
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,850
I want to go back home.

155
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,453
Boy, are you dumb, girl?

156
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,722
In this country there are two things
you cannot trust at all,

157
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,725
and that is guys with perms
and girls in red clothing.

158
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,328
No, you got yourself
into that world.

159
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,063
And so, you need
to get yourself out,

160
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,398
so see ya around.

161
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,099
Hey, wait up!

162
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,336
‐I wonder if my comics are still on sale.
‐Oh.

163
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,808
Don't worry, I'm sure
things will work out.

164
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,112
‐Oh!
‐Well, you want to go home, don't you?

165
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,447
So, then I'm going
to help you get home.

166
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,615
You will?

167
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,151
I may not look it,
but I'm a jack of all trades.

168
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,553
So I'm used to dealing
with situations like this.

169
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,988
A jack of all trades?

170
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,624
I'll do absolutely anything
that you ask.

171
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,026
Simply put,
I'm a kind of handyman.

172
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,628
Oh!

173
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,166
<i>If</i> <i>you</i> <i>want</i> <i>to</i> <i>leave</i> <i>Earth,</i> <i>you'll</i> <i>first</i>
<i>have</i> <i>to</i> <i>go</i> <i>to</i> <i>a</i> <i>Sky</i> <i>Terminal.</i>

174
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,934
<i>Right, let's go then!</i>

175
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,004
Are you guys idiots or what?

176
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,073
How can it be so hard
to bring back one girl?

177
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,075
You call yourselves gangsters?

178
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,043
Do you think it's fitting
for my employees?

179
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,946
Do you think it's fitting for someone
with a tight perm like I have?

180
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:50,416
But bossman, we're up against
a member of the Yato clan.

181
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,052
Even all of us together
are no match for...

182
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,489
Is there anything inside
that skull of yours?

183
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,390
That's why we need her!

184
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,626
If we use that monster girl's
mighty strength,

185
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,829
the tightly permed mob could finally
reach heights never seen before!

186
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,030
Okay, okay, let me go.

187
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,732
Okay, relax guys.

188
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:11,070
But if she refuses to come back,
I'm finished going easy on her.

189
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,841
You must kill her.

190
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,543
Otherwise, she'll become
a serious threat

191
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,745
if she goes and joins
a different gang.

192
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,680
It's best to get rid of any tools
we're finished using,

193
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,315
or they could get in the way.

194
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,024
Are you ready?
Let's go!

195
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,663
Look! Look there!

196
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,131
There she is!
Over there!

197
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,999
Really?
They found us already?

198
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,435
Gee, you're so useless,
four eyes.

199
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,771
That's why I said
I wanted a helicopter.

200
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:45,939
Wait, what helicopter?

201
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,273
You were the one
who told me

202
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,842
that we could outsmart them
by staying outside of the alleys!

203
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,348
You better stop running!

204
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,851
Do you have any
of the new comics?

205
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,520
We just sold out earlier.

206
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,423
I see, well, thank you anyways.

207
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,429
Do you finally feel
like using a helicopter?

208
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,599
Well, we don't have
that kind of money.

209
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,368
‐Huh?
‐Oh! It wasn't a joke after all!

210
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,870
Hey, look over here!

211
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,686
Do you have any comic books?

212
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,522
I have the latest issue
of "Youngblood".

213
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,591
The latest issue of "Youngblood"?

214
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,465
It stinks in here!

215
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,666
Now's not the time for that.

216
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,934
You just need to deal with it!

217
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,702
God, this is so bad!

218
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,237
But it stinks!

219
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,439
<i>Oh, comics.</i>

220
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,512
Comics... comics...c...

221
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,451
<i>Comics...</i>

222
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,392
<i>Comics!</i>

223
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,995
Lucky me!

224
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,704
They really are persistent.

225
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,373
So how long do you think
they plan on following us?

226
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,374
Well you tell me.

227
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,009
How did you plan
on helping me,

228
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,845
when you can't even
get us a helicopter to use?

229
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,780
You know it's not that easy.

230
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,848
I don't think I could even
afford an RC helicopter.

231
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:40,119
Stop making excuses and get us a
helicopter, you good for nothing kid.

232
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,754
You are getting mad at me?

233
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,822
I'm the one helping you out!

234
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,157
How can you be that way?

235
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,826
You're really just getting in the way,
so don't get cocky!

236
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,895
If you don't have money,
then give me some ideas!

237
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:49,929
What's with that?

238
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,498
Your demands were
the cause of all this! Uh!

239
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,310
What the...?
Where on earth did they go?

240
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,580
There's no way that
they could've gotten far. Uh!

241
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,617
All right, that way!

242
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,275
<i>We managed to get this far.</i>

243
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,444
<i>Any sign of the perm boys</i>
<i>anywhere?</i>

244
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,146
<i>No sign.</i>
<i>We are all good.</i>

245
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,750
If you catch the train from here,
you'll go straight to the Sky Terminal.

246
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,384
Then you'll be able
to go home.

247
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,855
I just can't help but think
about how heartless Gin is

248
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,224
looking for comic books
at a time like this.

249
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,892
It doesn't faze me.

250
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,462
<i>Everyone in the Capital</i>
<i>is like that.</i>

251
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,166
<i>They're cold hearted and</i>
<i>unsympathetic at least towards others.</i>

252
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,235
<i>But that's a very smart</i>
<i>way to live.</i>

253
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,605
<i>Unlike meddling folk who always</i>
<i>stick their noses in...</i>

254
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,006
<i>they're stupid.</i>

255
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:14,213
<i>And in the end, stupid people just</i>
<i>end up being taken advantage of.</i>

256
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,985
But I think it's much better
to be stupid than be a jerk.

257
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,554
‐Although I really hate you.
‐Huh?

258
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,023
That's weird, it sounded like you
just said something really nasty

259
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,091
with a straight face!

260
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,527
Honestly, I really hate
dorks with glasses.

261
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,961
Hey, what on earth
do you mean by that?

262
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,663
Are you bipolar or something?

263
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,632
What's with all of the insults?
After all that I've done for you!

264
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,834
‐Huh?
‐What's the matter?

265
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,406
I'm totally stuck.

266
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,242
No way... me too.

267
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,111
Oh no!
I want to cry!

268
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,048
The train's leaving!

269
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,249
We don't have a choice.

270
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,784
‐We have to roll!
‐Whoa!

271
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:59,692
Hey, hey, this isn't good, running into
an oncoming train is dangerous.

272
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,627
This is just too bad
for you, Kagura.

273
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,496
And you were so close
to escaping.

274
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,797
Inoue!

275
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,968
How cold of you to run away
without even saying goodbye to me

276
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,404
and after I treated you so well.

277
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:14,106
What happened to all
of your money problems?

278
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:18,644
Don't tell me you're about to go back to a
lifestyle of eating nothing but white rice.

279
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,980
I refuse to make money
off the suffering of others!

280
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,081
I refuse!

281
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,050
Nothing tastes good
when you earn it that way!

282
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,221
Even plain rice tastes good
after a day of hard, honest work!

283
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,856
That's funny coming
from someone

284
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,391
who doesn't know how to do
anything but fight, huh?

285
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,026
Isn't that right, Miss Yato Clan?

286
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,194
Yato Clan?

287
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,429
Oh dear, oh dear.

288
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,232
You've been helping her without
knowing who she really is, huh?

289
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,702
But of course you've heard
of them before, haven't you?

290
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:46,172
The mightiest and nastiest
of the mercenary races, the Yato.

291
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,342
<i>They don't look all</i>
<i>that different from humans</i>

292
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,577
<i>but they boast</i>
<i>phenomenal strength,</i>

293
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,980
<i>and with it they have destroyed</i>
<i>countless planets.</i>

294
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,916
<i>They're a warrior race</i>
<i>that simply loves to fight.</i>

295
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,054
It seems like you were hiding it, but
the proof is your white translucent skin

296
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,023
and that parasol you carry.

297
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,392
They say the Yato
hate sunlight,

298
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,728
so they always have to carry
their parasol on them.

299
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,162
Hey, Kagura!

300
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:14,033
You've covered your instincts with a
paper thin layer of morals,

301
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,802
but you were enjoying yourself
when you were fighting.

302
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,205
Deep down you crave blood.

303
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,440
‐This is your true nature, Kagura.
‐You're wrong, though!

304
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,009
Because I have...

305
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,810
<i>Because I have...</i>

306
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,615
<i>I have traveled across the galaxy and came</i>
<i>to Edo City in order to reinvent myself.</i>

307
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,285
<i>I will ask you again, Kagura.</i>

308
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,922
<i>There's this really, really bad guy</i>
<i>who's been picking on us lately.</i>

309
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,024
<i>Is he really a bad guy, Inoue?</i>

310
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,126
<i>Uh‐huh.</i>

311
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,028
<i>I guess I have to fight him.</i>

312
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,129
<i>That's why...</i>

313
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,197
<i>That's why I was so foolish.</i>

314
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,604
<i>Having rice with soup</i>
<i>is the very best!</i>

315
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,240
<i>I believed your words</i>

316
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,409
<i>and you manipulated me.</i>

317
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,910
You used me!

318
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,517
You're useless to me
if you're not gonna fight.

319
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,552
Goodbye, then.

320
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,254
Wait, hold on a second!

321
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,323
Hold on!
Please don't leave us!

322
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,160
Oh, no way!

323
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,662
The set up is right out
of an anime or comic book!

324
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,141
<i>Dreams are like trees.</i>

325
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,412
<i>It's more fun to climb them</i>
<i>than to watch them.</i>

326
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,385
<i>And there are things you only learn</i>
<i>when you climb them.</i>

327
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,022
<i>For example, I sweat a lot.</i>

328
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,795
<i>Fountain pens are</i>
<i>a real pain in the butt!</i>

329
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,032
<i>It's a pain in the butt drawing</i>
<i>backgrounds, too!</i>

330
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,901
<i>Comic books are such a pain</i>
<i>in the butt to draw.</i>

331
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:59,405
<i>Come to think of it, just living</i>
<i>is a pain in the butt.</i>

332
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,408
<i>I want to become</i>
<i>steamed cheese bread!</i>

333
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,324
Oh, no way!

334
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,160
The set up is right out of
an anime or comic book!

335
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,537
You guys are nothing
but a lot of trouble!

336
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,738
It's Gin!

337
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,842
Hey, the two of you
better clench your teeth!

338
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,577
Huh? Hold on!

339
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,681
Hold on!

340
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,216
Go, you're free!

341
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,393
What?
What happened?

342
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,995
What's going on?

343
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,197
I like to fight.

344
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,332
‐I really like to fight.
‐Huh?

345
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,503
That is the Yato's true nature

346
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,138
and I won't deny it.

347
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,440
But from now on

348
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,710
I want to fight against the Yato
nature that's within me.

349
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,314
And I'm going to kill you,
so I can change!

350
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,850
You... you Yato idiot!

351
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,251
Come on, now, men, right now.

352
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,753
Come and get them!
Alright?

353
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,123
Huh... I can't do this anymore!

354
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,926
‐Get them yourself, you permed moron!
‐Hey, come back here!

355
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:28,594
‐Inoue!
‐Ye... ye... yes.

356
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,262
How can I help you?

357
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,964
You remember, don't you?

358
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,500
The first thing
you told me that day?

359
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,207
Care to change your life
by coming with me?

360
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,847
Did I really say something?

361
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,019
Inoue, there's something I've been
meaning to say to you.

362
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,157
That afro hairdo just isn't
a good look for you at all!

363
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:01,260
Hey it's not an afro,
it's a tight perm!

364
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,695
Who cares!

365
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,832
Oh! I hate this.

366
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,907
I found one!

367
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,045
If you were gonna help us,

368
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,047
you should have just come
with us from the beginning.

369
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,983
I don't understand you at all.

370
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,417
Are you shy?

371
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,487
Oh, I didn't exactly come here
to help you out.

372
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,755
I was only looking
for my comics,

373
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,191
and I just happened
to come to the station.

374
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,328
Our lives are worth less than a couple
of dollars and a comic book?

375
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,599
Oh, look, the train's here.

376
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,669
Get on quick and don't come back
here again, nightmare girl!

377
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,871
Well, I'd really like to do that,

378
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,373
but when I think about it,

379
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:50,409
I don't have any money to pay
the fare for my way home.

380
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,312
So, I'm going to stay here a
little longer and save money.

381
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,982
So with that being said, I'm going
to ask you to let me work for you.

382
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,519
No! You... you've got
to be kidding!

383
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,055
Why would I hire a girl
as violent as you are?

384
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,125
I'm sorry, did you say something?

385
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,194
‐No, ma'am, not a word.
‐No, ma'am, not a word.

386
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:13,799
<i>And so, our workplace</i>
<i>got a lot livelier yet again.</i>

387
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,967
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

388
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:15,968
<i>Let's go get them.</i>

389
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,372
May I have some extra helpings?

390
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,042
Just how many bowls
do you think you've had?

391
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,176
This isn't a restaurant.

392
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,078
This is a place that serves drinks

393
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,481
along with a helping
of healthy eroticism, not food.

394
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,384
It's a hostess bar,
a haven for old men!

395
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,787
If you just want to eat,

396
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:38,023
then why don't you go order
a kid's meal at a fast food restaurant!

397
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,159
I have no interest
in fancy food.

398
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,560
Pickles are just fine.

399
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,129
You've sure got simple taste
for such a little pig!

400
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,333
Hey, Gintoki, tell me,
what's with this little girl?

401
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,301
She's already had five
bowls of rice!

402
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,469
Where's she from?

403
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,670
Five bowls, huh?

404
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,173
She's still got a lot more to go.

405
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,576
And all we have left at home
is a little sugar and salt now.

406
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,845
What's with those two?

407
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,047
All skinny and worn away like that.

408
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,216
Huh?

409
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,886
<i>Hey, you're still eating?</i>

410
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,022
<i>Somebody, stop her!</i>

411
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:13,092
<i>Somebody!</i>

412
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,856
<i>We're mistaken for terrorists and</i>
<i>are chased by the Shinsengumi.</i>

413
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,392
<i>But Gin's friend, Katsura, helps us out.</i>

414
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:56,495
<i>Hey, Cobra, it's been a while.</i>

415
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,730
<i>The next episode...</i>

416
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,403
Umm... Do you have a copy of Bleach?

417
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:06,205
We only have Gin Tama.
