3
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:09,209
<i>But we didn't know that it was</i>

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,644

5
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,179

6
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,637

7
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,374
<i>it seems like we will see a clear</i>

8
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:49,810
<i>However...</i>

9
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,413

10
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,915

11
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,917

12
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,719

What a downer to start the day.

18
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,308
<i>Especially, any Virgos</i>

24
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,621
What kind of luck is that?

25
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,256
There's nothing lucky about that at all!

Oh, like hell I will!

29
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,895
That damn show!
It's so stupid.

30
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:45,232
I mean, there's no way
that it's accurate.

31
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,602
If all Virgos disappeared,
then we'd be left with a society

32
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,104
filled with nothing but a
bunch of blood thirsty men.

33
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,506
Right, Okita?

34
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,374
Here, take this.

35
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,610
I wore this red loincloth
when I was a kid.

36
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:57,644
Don't you worry.

37
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,945
I washed it.

38
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,118
What do you mean,
"Don't you worry I washed it?"

39
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,154
Should I be worrying
about something?

40
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,456
Can you believe him, Hijikata?

41
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,323
Take this.

42
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,959
I used to wear this red scarf
a long time ago.

43
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,697
Hey, stop it.

44
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:18,732
What is this?

45
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:19,833
I mean, what happened?

46
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,502
Or rather, what's gonna
happen to me?

47
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,705
Ta‐ta‐ta‐ta‐taya!

48
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,975
You stinking Gorilla!

49
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,216
What?

50
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,885
Ma‐Matsudaira, is that you?

51
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,788
Get up, you gorilla bastard!

52
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,358
Get up before I count to three,
or I'll blow your balls off!

53
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:46,760
Ready?

54
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:47,694
One...

55
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,262
What happened to two and three?

56
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,031
"Number one" is the only number...

57
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,199
that a man needs.

58
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,568
To be truthful, I don't need
any other numbers in my life.

59
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,369
You just said "THREE" seconds!

60
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,671
What the hell?
Come on, now!

61
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,372
You can't just do anything you want

62
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,275
just because you're the
commissioner of police, you know!

63
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,010
Shut your trap, Kondo.

64
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,579
Because of you...

65
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,514
this old man's...

66
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,183
this old man's head might roll,
as they say.

67
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:14,454
Huh?!
What are you talking about?

68
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,824
I picked you guys up off the street,
how many years ago was that?

69
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,893
Well, I wish I could start over.

70
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,394
Uh.

71
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,297
I should never let a lot like
you into the organization,

72
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,932
and I wish I could redo all this.

73
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,434
Ah.

74
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,071
And if I had the ability to do so,
I'd like to start again...

75
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,775
from scratch, from back when you were
still in your dad's ball sack.

76
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,011
What's that supposed to mean?

77
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,346
I told you.

78
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,181
I said to stay out of trouble.

79
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,782
I already knew you guys were morons,

80
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,653
but I never thought you'd get involved
with the Purgatory, that's for sure.

81
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,420
Huh?

82
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,321
Pervert Story?

83
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,358
I mean I love adult flicks, but I don't
remember getting involved with one.

84
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,160
No, you, moron!
‐Don't shoot!

85
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,862
I would've promoted you
if that was the case!

86
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,864
<i>My goodness!</i>

87
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,699
I still have a mortgage to pay!

88
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,903
So say goodbye to my
daughter studying abroad

89
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,571
and my wife's beauty salon!

90
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,439
What are you gonna
to do about this, huh?

91
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:15,882
What?

92
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,417
The Tendo sect?

93
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,920
I, I heard a rumor that the
Tendo sect controls the,

94
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,923
Shogun and that it is the real secret
power behind the government!

95
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,124
Is that really true?

96
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,492
Don't talk so damn loud!

97
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,760
And yeah, that's right!

98
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,861
They control the Shogun...

99
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,497
and yes, they are real power
behind the Government!

100
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,665
Now who's being loud?

101
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,633
So you're confirming the rumor.

102
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,203
I'm saying that you were
causing a ruckus...

103
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,572
and that it was deep in
their territory! Huh?

104
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,073
What?

105
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,841
You're telling me
right now we caused

106
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,944
a ruckus deep in the
Tendo sect's territoy?

107
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,545
Hey, hey, you're so transparent.

108
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,147
I know you're pretending that you don't
know.

109
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,648
How 'bout I shoot you, huh?

110
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,650
Should I?

111
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,285
Th‐They did this.

112
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,154
They did it while I was gone.

113
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,126
So, you mean, that we were
called in by the Tendo Sect...

114
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,528
to be punished?

115
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,930
I bet we're an eyesore for them,

116
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,433
but I don't think they'd
do that to us right now.

117
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,502
Doing anything to us publicly

118
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,871
will be the same as admitting
they were involved

119
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,707
with the Purgatory and
that whole mess.

120
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,676
We're in great danger more than
that at this moment.

121
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,078
They might be calling us
to the castle

122
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,714
in order to get the two of us
together and then...

123
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,449
Boom!

124
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,084
It would be a perfect opportunity.

125
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,588
<i>The sign of the Virgo.</i>
<i>You're dying today!</i>

126
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:32,759
And...

127
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,962
then, they can just blame it
all on the Exclusionist Rebels.

128
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,798
I wanna go home now!

129
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,166
What do you think you are you doing?

130
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,034
Let go!

131
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,503
I don't want to die with an
ugly old coot like you!

132
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,039
No, I want to die on Otae 's lap!

133
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,173
You idiot!

134
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,876
You know the way of Samurai
is found in Death!

135
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,212
No way!

136
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,215
I would rather live my hairy life,
because I love my hairy ass!

137
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,082
Listen!

138
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,752
If we work together, we might
be able to reach the castle alive.

139
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,220
If we can do that, we win!

140
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,089
They can't kill us publicly if
we get to the castle first.

141
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,125
‐We'll survive!
‐We'll survive?

142
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,159
Maybe.

143
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,528
Mommy, I'm coming home!

144
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,697
Calm down!

145
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,299
We're all gonna die eventually.

146
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,367
But the important thing
is how you live your life!

147
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,502
No way!

148
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,304
I want to live a fun and kinky life!

149
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,339
It all depends on your fortune.

150
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,474
So believe in your fortune.

151
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,844
Fortune...
Hey old man...

152
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,547
Tell me, what's your horoscope sign?

153
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,448
Huh?

154
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,616
I'm a Virgo, why?

155
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,018
Oh God, we're doomed!

156
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,020
It's 100 percent certain
that we're all going to die!

157
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,889
‐It's a death drive!
‐Calm down!

158
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:36,856
‐It's hopeless!
‐Calm down!

159
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,625
‐If you don't, I'll snag a booger
‐It's hopeles!

160
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,160
‐from your big nose and shove it...
‐I wanna go home!

161
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,127
‐back up into your stupid brain!
‐Shut up!

162
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,796
I can't believe you're a Virgo!

163
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,564
You don't act like a virgo at all!

164
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,933
Your horoscope must be a
mobster or something.

165
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,668
Yes, you're definitely a mobster!

166
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,637
I don't want to hear
that from you, Kondo!

167
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,739
Why don't I shoot you
into space right now?

168
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,275
Then you can be a brand
new horoscope, Gorilles!

169
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,377
‐No, no way!
‐You two, please calm down...!

170
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,244
Let me go!

171
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,713
Let go!

172
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,130
Hey, hey, hey!

173
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,299
Look where you're going when you're
driving!

174
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,534
Give me a break!
All right?

175
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,870
You are an assassin, aren't you?

176
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,573
Yes, you're an assassin, right?

177
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:27,474
Say it!

178
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:28,541
I bet you're an assassin.

179
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,076
What?!
What are you talking about?

180
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,311
I'm.

181
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,515
Hey, you pops!

182
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,750
Are you crazy?

183
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,451
Come on, what the hell
are you thinking?

184
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,397
Hey, let me drive now.

185
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,265
It's a war zone from here on out.

186
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,600
You go on home now.

187
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,934
A‐a‐all right.

188
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,237
Hey, Boss, but what are you doing?

189
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,406
He looked like a normal man to me!

190
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:00,407
You idiot!

191
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,776
The guy was wearing sunglasses,
wasn't he?

192
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,177
Definitely an assassin.

193
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,311
Huh?

194
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:09,382
Anyone who wears sunglasses is
an assassin, 99% of the time.

195
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,284
But you're wearing sunglasses, too!

196
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,987
This secret is just between you and me.

197
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,256
<i>You know Stevie Wonder, the singer?</i>

198
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,891
He's also an assassin.

199
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,893
So is the world‐famous Kurosawa,

200
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,095
Michael Jackson,
and also John Lennon.

201
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,830
But don't tell anyone this.

202
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,265
I couldn't tell anyone!

203
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,001
It's just a delusional old man's
stupid imaginations!

204
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,235
Hey.
He's still alive!

205
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,404
Hello.

206
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,739
Excuse me.

207
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,541
I'm late because.

208
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,543
I dropped my glasses
on the way over.

209
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,077
Who the heck are you?

210
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:38,978
I don't know.

211
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,080
Without my glasses on,
I can't see anything,

212
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,616
I can't see where I'm standing
or where I'm heading to.

213
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:44,517
Hey...

214
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,119
now get a hold of yourself!

215
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:46,820
Oh!

216
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,254
Are you the driver's pet?

217
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,556
Like a gorilla?

218
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,857
What kind of gorilla are you?

219
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,725
Like that car, Gorilla Mark II?

220
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,793
Oh, you like that?

221
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,761
Good boy.

222
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,996
I'm a human being, not a gorilla.

223
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,265
Don't you worry, she's on our side.

224
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,900
This is Sacchan.

225
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,602
Here, hold onto this, Saccchan.

226
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,003
She's my old friend.

227
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,873
She's a freelance contract
killer right now...

228
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,609
but she used to be an elite
secret agent.

229
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,110
Because as everyone knows.

230
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,681
To kill an assassin, one needs
to use an assassin!

231
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,216
Matsudaira, what's this?

232
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,518
I can't see clearly, what is it?

233
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,620
Hey, watch out with that!

234
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,388
Oh?
A peppermint dispenser?

235
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,057
Peppermint is great for
reducing sleepiness

236
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,258
and preventing bad breath, here!

237
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:25,959
Stop!

238
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,595
That's not going to stop bad breath,
it'll stop your breath period!

239
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,296
It's such a weird shape, isn't it?

240
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,432
How do I get the peppermint out,
do I press here?

241
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:34,501
Stop that!

242
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,936
I'll give you something better than
a peppermint, so please!

243
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,238
Stop!
Don't touch me!

244
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,405
Don't touch me!

245
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,307
My heart already belongs
to another man!

246
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,375
‐Let me go!
‐Geez!

247
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,110
Why is this person
even here with us?

248
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,312
Shut up!
Enough yelling!

249
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,213
You're distracting me!

250
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,448
W‐Watch out!

251
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,091
H‐Hey, Pops!

252
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,259
Did we hit something?

253
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,126
Hey, Boss!

254
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,127
You just hit something!

255
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,529
It just went flying!

256
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,564
Yeah, that was an assassin as well.

257
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,367
No way, you liar!
You just made that up!

258
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:08,768
You know what they say...

259
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,337
you can't make an omelette
without breaking an assassin.

260
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,139
You there, just shut up!

261
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,674
Who is this guy?

262
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,476
Why is he ordering me around?

263
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,578
There's only one person
in the world

264
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,580
who can order me around
or tie me up.

265
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,881
But how strange.

266
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,250
I find I'm beginning to love hearing
his harsh words.

267
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,685
Please just shut the hell up!

268
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,386
Pretty please!

269
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,086
Now what is this?

270
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,121
"Pretty please?"

271
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,689
You shifted your gear to reverse?

272
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,024
You're too complicated.

273
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,259
But I'll try to understand.

274
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,495
You're not even close!
You're totally clueless!

275
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:38,298
Like a teenage girl trying on
make up for the first time!

276
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,972
You have hurt Elizabeth!

277
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,308
And I will not forgive you.

278
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,276
No!

279
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,013
So you've come for me
at last, assassin!

280
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,384
We're scraping the wall!

281
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,786
Sparks!
On both sides of the car!

282
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:00,853
Do you see...

283
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,855
my special driving technique?

284
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,190
That's no technique!

285
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,225
All I'm hearing is squeak and shriek!

286
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,061
Come on, Kondo, and shut up.

287
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:08,795
Hey!

288
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,530
Look!
Look out ahead!

289
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,932
Don't worry, I'm Schumacher, you know!

290
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,272
That was close.

291
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,707
The assassin totally wrecked the car!

292
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:21,808
Assassin?
Where is he?

293
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,609
Where's the assasin?

294
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,644
You totally crashed the car yourself!

295
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,080
You know, a kind person
takes all the blame,

296
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,581
and ends up hurting himself.

297
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,984
What are you going to do now?

298
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,052
Because now we don't have
any transportation.

299
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:33,987
Huh?

300
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,656
Hee, hoo, hee, hoo, hee, hoo, hee, hoo,
hee, hoo, hee, hoo, hee, hoo, hee, hoo,

301
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,293
hee, hoo, hee, hoo, hee, hoo, hee, hoo,
hee, hoo, hee, hoo...

302
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,394
That is a...

303
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,895
This is an emergency.

304
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,631
We should commandeer that bicycle.

305
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:46,899
Wait, where are you going!

306
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,402
I have a bad feeling about that bicycle.

307
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,771
It's punishment!
It's punishment, right?

308
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,439
Because I want to be punished!

309
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,208
I love Punishment!

310
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,410
Cut it out, already, crazy lady!

311
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,029
What a mess this whole situation is!

312
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,831
For the sake of those poor innocent
people who gave us this bike,

313
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,334
we have to get to the
castle alive, no matter what!

314
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:25,838
Hee hoo, hee hoo, hee hoo,
hee hoo I wonder why?

315
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:29,242
All of a sudden, I can see nothing
but darkness ahead.

316
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,144
Is this a reflection of my soul?

317
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,478
When did it become so dark?

318
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,446
Huh?
No!

319
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,381
Sacchan don't give in
to the darkness!

320
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:36,883
If you can't find a backdoor,

321
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,418
you have to
make one for yourself!

322
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,152
You have to!

323
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,420
Right there!

324
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,789
Aaaaah!

325
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,426
It disappeared!
It disappeared!

326
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,894
My darkness disappeared!

327
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:51,597
I'm done.

328
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,066
I am so done.

329
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,567
I should've just gone home.

330
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,673
Hm?..

331
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,642
What the heck is that over there?

332
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,278
It's just a sad bunch of
edgy attention seekers

333
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,914
who think they're on a
vacation riding a bike.

334
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,117
At least they aren't causing
anyone any trouble.

335
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,287
I really don't know what to do about
those losers living above my bar.

336
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,223
They come up with so many
excuses to not pay their rent!

337
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,293
But my patience is wearing thin
and is about to reach its limit!

338
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,628
You're acting as if they
owe you the rent!

339
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,797
Hey, Kondo.

340
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,232
Do you see them?

341
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,167
They are assassins.

342
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,369
What?
There's no way, come on!

343
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,905
Can't you see it, Kondo?

344
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,741
Look at their dark auras.

345
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,109
There's no doubt.

346
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,877
Yes, I can see it as well.

347
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:38,811
What?

348
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,046
Their postures.

349
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,914
Only those who carry
the deepest sorrows

350
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,649
within can strike that kind of pose.

351
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,118
What the hell are you talking about?

352
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,320
I can't see it, so come on, guys!

353
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,655
Let's kill them before they kill us!

354
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,068
This is..

355
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,603
a pedestrian road!

356
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,438
Yes, Ma'am.

357
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,744
Well, things like this happen.

358
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,079
No way!

359
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,181
I was just so scared of them!

360
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,717
I thought I might piss my pants
at this old age you know.

361
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,586
Yeah, well, your eyes are certainly
pissing alright.

362
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,960
There, there, fluffy things!

363
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,463
How many of them would you like,
Mr. Amanto?

364
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,765
G, all of them.

365
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,634
Get every last one of them.

366
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:38,204
You manage to act like a jobless loser
who never leaves his mommy's nest.

367
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,539
Well done, Prince!

368
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,808
They're so fluffy!

369
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,209
So cute!

370
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,848
I finally found you, assassin.

371
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:49,782
Seriously.

372
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,317
I can't keep up with this crap.

373
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,919
W‐What are you doing?!

374
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,687
Don't you know, I'm Prince Hata!

375
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,789
‐Prince Kaka?
‐Not Kaka!

376
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,524
It's Prince Hata.
Hata!

377
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,159
G! Do something!

378
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,093
Sir!

379
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,796
Umm so...

380
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,198
I'm so sorry!

381
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,433
You can take him,
but please spare me!

382
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,101
All right.

383
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,330
But in exchange, can I take your car?

384
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,872
Of course, if you let me live!

385
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,006
Hey!

386
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,308
Wha?

387
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:16,909
We don't have time.
Hurry up!

388
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:17,710
All right!

389
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,079
Why did you let those two go?

390
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,314
I thought they're assasins.

391
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,282
Well, they were just small fries.

392
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,820
Hi, fancy seeing you here!

393
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,955
You're shopping here, too?

394
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,990
What a surprise to see you
in this kind of place.

395
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,160
As I thought, you and I are
destined to be together, Otae!

396
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,328
Oh,my goodness.

397
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,663
Looks like a gorilla has
escaped from the zoo.

398
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,167
I should call the Exterminators
and have it shot dead ASAP.

399
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,269
Let's see, their catch phrase is.

400
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,606
"Call us and they're dead
as a Dodo, we promise!"

401
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,740
Otae, please!

402
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,609
Are you kidding me right now?

403
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,610
It's me, Kondo!

404
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,111
It's your Kondo!

405
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,279
Such a bad gorilla!

406
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,747
He's threatening me!

407
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,283
You should know your place, gorilla!

408
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,252
Now I'm going to show you!

409
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,728
Today's unluckiest horoscope is.

410
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,162
The sign of a Virgo.

411
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:11,998
You're dying today!

412
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,100
I die today...

413
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,701
Stop it Sis!

414
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,370
He's not a gorilla!
He's Kondo!

415
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,838
Not a gorilla at all!

416
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,375
Oh my, if it isn't Kondo
all of a sudden.

417
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,777
It was always him, Sis.
It was Kondo from the start!

418
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,661
I'll shoot you if you don't start driving
by the time I finish counting to ten.

419
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:42,695
Ten.

420
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,030
You didn't even count!

421
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,464
You just missed me!

422
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:46,532
So close!

423
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,200
Otae, what did you just say?

424
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,502
Do you really wish I was dead?

425
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,636
No way!

426
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:57,710
I've got it!

427
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,312
This breadstick is
from Olive Garden!

428
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,847
This barbeque sauce is
from Outback Steakhouse.

429
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,116
And this dip is from Red Lobster.

430
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,785
I see they've changed the recipe.

431
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,121
You're so amazing, Kagura!

432
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,090
Call me "Ultimate Tongue."

433
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,828
Running out of gas?

434
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,530
I bet you're an assassin, too!

435
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,230
Yeah.

436
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,865
We'll be replaced by this gorilla before

437
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:20,833
‐we knew it.
‐B‐Boss!

438
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,301
Please calm down, I beg you.

439
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,404
It's my last wish!
My last wish!

440
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:26,339
Really?

441
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,774
Just how many "last wishes"
do you have, then?

442
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,276
It's my first wish!
My first wish!

443
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,544
Hey!

444
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,512
That's it!

445
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,647
Whoa!

446
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,521
Let's go, amazing gorilla power!

447
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:43,689
Oooh.
Oh, no.

448
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,891
And now he's admitted
that he is a gorilla.

449
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:49,528
Well, I guess it's better for him to
realize who he really is.

450
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,331
Hey! How can you guys
just relax back there?

451
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,005
You can't run from your sins,
you know.

452
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,073
Face your death!

453
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,409
Oh, my!
What a giant peppermint.

454
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,512
With a size this large, it can save
the entire city from bad breath.

455
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,147
Whoa!
It's a bomb!

456
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,515
Throw it!
Hurry!

457
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,150
Where are my glasses?

458
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,518
I need my glasses.

459
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,920
‐I need my glasses to.
‐Just throw it already!

460
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,022
Here we go!

461
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,590
Get down everyone!

462
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,693
Huh?

463
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:21,861
Oh! it's you.

464
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,298
‐OH!
‐OH!

465
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,034
Holy.

466
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,504
Eh?

467
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,438
What?

468
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:33,706
Was that my booger?

469
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,508
Did my booger just do that?

470
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,015
It's time, Kondo.

471
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:05,404
Commissioner of National Police,
Katakuriko Matsudaira.

472
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,507
And Shinsengumi chief, Isao Kondo.

473
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,310
Here, at your service, sirs!

474
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:14,980
Yes.
Very good.

475
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,983
Today, I've called you here
because of the incident

476
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,953
that occurred the other day
regarding the underground arena,

477
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,588
the Purgatory.

478
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,559
Did something happen to you two?

479
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,493
Nothing.

480
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,929
Just some trouble baking
some pecan pies.

481
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,400
So you got into another fight,
did you?

482
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,336
All Samurai are very brave, after all.

483
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,539
I've heard it only took
thirty of your men

484
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,541
to take down the Purgatory.

485
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,644
There're so many cowardly samurai

486
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,848
around these days, but you
did an awesome job.

487
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:49,915
Yes...

488
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,750
you and your men were
quite impressive.

489
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,018
Thanks to you,

490
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,121
we have maintained
a serene balance

491
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,356
between the Amanto
and the Earthlings.

492
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:58,891
I commend you both.

493
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,262
But you'd better not rush too
fast to obtain victory.

494
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,532
I understand your sense of justice,

495
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,801
but if you start biting at everything,

496
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,170
you might end up biting tails of wolves

497
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,406
and get your head chewed off,
do you understand what I'm saying?

498
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,878
Piss off the big guys,
and they'll wipe you all out,

499
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,880
so you'd better take our advice.

500
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:26,051
If you want to live a long life,
you'd better learn to be smart.

501
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,059
Well, it seems we survived somehow.

502
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,094
Well yeah.

503
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:38,330
I think we had been misunderstanding
their intentions all along.

504
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,166
That was a really fierce fight.

505
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:43,669
One of the top five closest
calls of my entire life.

506
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,737
Hey, Pops,

507
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,840
I feel like I would've made it to the
castle with no problems whatsoever

508
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,141
if I hadn't been with you.

509
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:53,479
Yeah, well let's make sure this is the
last time we're in this situation, huh?

510
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,514
I have enough problems at home,
you know.

511
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:59,150
My daughter has a new boyfriend
who cross dresses and it's messing with my head.

512
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,387
This will be the last chance
for you because...

513
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,690
if something like this
happens again, you are..

514
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,525
Yeah... I understand.

515
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:10,162
I'm sorry I caused you
so much trouble, Boss.

516
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,599
We'll make sure we won't
get caught the next time.

517
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,335
Heh...

518
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,039
As long as you understand.

519
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,614
Oh, yeah right, the horoscope.

520
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,984
Just as I thought, that was
a phony horoscope!

521
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,786
"Virgos will die" bullshit!

522
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:34,954
Oh!

523
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,655
There she is!

524
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,023
‐Otae!
‐Oh, Big Sis! Come on!

525
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,024
What a coincidence
to see you again!

526
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,926
I'd never expected
to find you here.

527
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:49,501
You're right, Kondo.

528
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:50,936
What a coincidence!

529
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:56,108
Ahh!

530
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,069
<i>Health, health me!</i>

531
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,704
<i>What's the matter, Kagura?</i>

532
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,306
<i>Something black and shiny</i>
