1
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,910
"The promising young
pop star, TAMA.

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,979
Her cat ears are so cute..."

3
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,648
Hey, isn't she's the one who
topped Otsu with her hit song,

4
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:15,916
who pushed her to eighth place

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,018
on the Edo City's
Hot Hundred Chart?

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,052
This makes me sick.

7
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,254
What's so great about her?

8
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:23,223
If she lost those ears, she'd be
just like any other girl!

9
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,324
Tell me about it.

10
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,226
Cat ears are so superficial!

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,929
But if Otsu had her
own set of cat ears,

12
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,864
I bet her popularity
would soar through

13
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,866
the roof because
they are so cute!

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,468
What are you saying, Sergeant?

15
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,069
Otsu doesn't need cat ears!

16
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,705
Right now, she's at her very
best and her very cutest!

17
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,973
Come on, Tucker.

18
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:44,011
It's a fact that a large number of
people are attracted to cat ears.

19
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,647
In other words,
you've got to admit that fact

20
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,849
in order to have
constructive discussions.

21
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:52,819
Indeed, Otsu is cute and has
a very beautiful voice, sure.

22
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,355
But it's an undeniable fact
that these qualities

23
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,259
alone are not enough to keep running
as the top idols in the pop industry.

24
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,661
Look here, man!

25
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,530
Aren't you the one who's running
on the wrong track, Sergeant?

26
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,100
In fact, I'm pretty sure I saw you
buying TAMA's photo collection.

27
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,169
Th‐That was just a...

28
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,574
Captain!

29
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:15,575
Sergeant!

30
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,879
Tell me Rule Number 14 of the Otsu
Terakado Fan Club Regulations!

31
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:23,016
M‐Members of the
Otsu Terakado Fan Club

32
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,352
shall worship no other
idols but Otsu!

33
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,820
That's exactly right!

34
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:30,157
Sergeant! You were one of the club's
top officials, but you broke the rule!

35
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,526
Therefore, you will be punished
with a Nose Hook Destroyer!

36
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,028
A Honestly.
Young people these days.

37
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,197
What in the world
are they thinking?

38
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,733
Hey, stop!
Stop it, leave me alone.

39
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,435
Come on!

40
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,136
Come and have
a drink with me, toots.

41
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,471
‐Yeah.
‐Stop.

42
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:45,572
Hey, let go of me!

43
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:46,673
Stop!

44
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,141
Don't ignore me, sweet cheeks...

45
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,043
‐I just want you to listen to me.
‐Stop it...

46
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:50,744
Come on.

47
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,413
A Honestly.
A drunk old man now?

48
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,382
What is this world coming to?

49
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,317
It's a real shame.

50
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,853
I'm really in a jam.
I just want to talk please.

51
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,788
I have bunch of
idiots working for me

52
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,956
and they're all so useless.

53
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,391
And now even my daughter is...

54
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,726
‐You stink!
‐What, I stink?

55
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:06,727
Stop!

56
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,563
Come on, little lady, isn't that
a bit much to say to me.

57
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,531
No, stop!
Get away from me!

58
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:12,432
Hey, listen...

59
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,168
Somebody!!
Somebody, please help!

60
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,914
Who cares about cat ears?

61
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,017
There's also a woman with cat ears...

62
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,719
living a floor beneath us but
she's more like a mountain lion!

63
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,788
I don't give a crap about cat ears!

64
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,024
And those losers drooling over them!

65
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,259
As far as I'm concerned,
all cat ears should be burned!

66
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,193
Excuse me.

67
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,061
What is it?

68
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,896
I'm very busy right now!

69
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,899
Excuse me, I just want to
thank you for saving me!

70
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,901
What you did was
just so amazing.

71
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,169
Thank you.

72
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,771
You are very brave!

73
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,008
Cat ears are...

74
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,277
Cat ears are...

75
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,281
Cat ears are...

76
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,651
purr‐fect!

77
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:39,946
<i>Hey, Shin?</i>

78
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,049
Shin, those are your nostrils.

79
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,484
What is that?

80
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,852
Is that your silent way
of telling me

81
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,687
you don't want to eat
what I've cooked for you?

82
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,523
No...
It's not like that.

83
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,323
Sorry, Sis.

84
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,792
I was just spaced out.

85
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,360
What's wrong, huh, Shin?

86
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,328
You've been acting a
little strange lately.

87
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,963
And I heard from Gin that lately...

88
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,266
your follow‐ups on everyone's
shitty jokes have been weak.

89
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,834
You've got to get a hold of yourself.

90
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,035
If you don't play the straight man,

91
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,904
then this world will be filled
up with stupid jokes

92
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,705
and everything will
blow up in the end.

93
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,340
I'm sorry, Sis.

94
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,175
No‐ho.

95
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:11,077
You're not supposed to apologize
to me, you're supposed to react!

96
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,812
You should've said
something like

97
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,748
"Your stupid jokes are what's
destroying the world!"

98
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,016
I'm sorry, Sis.

99
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,317
Sorry, I'll say it now.

100
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,286
Your stupid jokes are...

101
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,488
Who are you calling stupid?

102
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,895
<i>What is wrong with me, huh?</i>

103
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,066
<i>Ever since I saw her, that girl's face</i>
<i>won't leave my head.</i>

104
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,801
<i>And now my heart aches...</i>

105
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,303
<i>It's painful...</i>

106
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,805
<i>I can only think of</i>
<i>that cateared girl.</i>

107
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,107
<i>I never thought I would have</i>
<i>feelings for any girl...</i>

108
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,009
<i>other than Otsu, but Cat ears...</i>

109
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,444
<i>They have a strange power,</i>

110
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,079
<i>to cast you</i>
<i>under their spell.</i>

111
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,581
No, no, no, no, no!

112
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,850
<i>Otsu is the only girl that matters.</i>

113
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,651
<i>I would never cheat on her, never!</i>

114
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,153
Umm...

115
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,155
I'd like to repay you
for your kindness.

116
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,323
Could you please
give me your address

117
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,058
so that I can send you
a thank you letter?

118
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,593
<i>She said that, I'm sure...</i>

119
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:00,827
<i>but did she really mean it?</i>

120
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,362
<i>How is she going to repay me?</i>

121
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:03,863
<i>Does she want me to marry her?</i>

122
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,999
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

123
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,337
<i>I am Captain Shinpachi Shimura</i>
<i>of the Otsu Terakado Fan Club!</i>

124
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,205
<i>I can never be unfaithful!</i>

125
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,409
<i>I have to stop having</i>
<i>such silly daydreams.</i>

126
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,278
<i>Nothing that sweet has</i>
<i>ever happened to me.</i>

127
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,547
<i>Not, in the last sixteen</i>
<i>years of my life.</i>

128
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,550
<i>I've gotta know where</i>
<i>I'm standing.</i>

129
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,352
<i>I shouldn't be dreaming</i>
<i>above clouds.</i>

130
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,087
<i>There's no way a girl like that</i>

131
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,922
<i>would ever fall for</i>
<i>a dull guy like me.</i>

132
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,259
Good morning, everyone!

133
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,439
Meow!

134
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,807
How do I look, Gin?

135
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
Aren't they cool?

136
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,177
Hey, hey, you shouldn't
mess around with those.

137
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,912
They're for Shinpachi,
you know.

138
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,714
Put them back in the box,
right away.

139
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,518
But you're eating the cake that
was also in the box for Shinpachi,

140
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,286
aren't you?

141
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,854
Eating food is okay.

142
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,957
No one can tell it even existed
once it's in your stomach.

143
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,058
Oh, oh no.

144
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,359
Shinpachi's gonna be
here any minute.

145
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,193
I'd better put it away.

146
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,762
Hey!
That's not fair!

147
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,264
You can't because I haven't
had a single bite of it!

148
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,201
Oh wow!
This is good.

149
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,270
That's not good.

150
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,271
Now look.

151
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,139
You've ruined my plan

152
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,473
to eat it in a way
that would make it seem

153
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,808
as if it was always like this.

154
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,443
Look what you did, Kagura.

155
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,011
We need to fix this.

156
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:25,912
Oh well.

157
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,480
I'll take a little bit off of here.

158
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,748
You help, too.

159
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:29,849
Make it round.

160
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,985
Make it a small round cake.

161
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,755
No, not round like that,
make it cylindrical!

162
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,525
Hey, Gin, this is bad.

163
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,859
It more like candle
than a cake.

164
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,961
That's the sad thing
about candles.

165
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,797
The more you use them,
the more they shrink.

166
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,032
That's why Shinpachi's
always short,

167
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,400
you're always using him!

168
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,336
Exactly, and we must never
let him know.

169
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,037
So let's just put this all away.

170
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,572
I'll put you away!

171
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,941
What are you two doing,
opening other people's mail, huh?

172
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,877
Don't you know there are things
people should and shouldn't do!

173
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,779
Ow‐ow‐ow‐ow‐ow, Shinpachi.

174
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,915
If you are here
you should say so.

175
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,850
Were you enjoying
secretly watching us

176
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,051
and eavesdropping, huh?

177
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,086
That's very sneaky.

178
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:06,820
You're disgusting!

179
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,222
You're the ones who are sneaky
and disgusting, not me!

180
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,857
Well, we didn't really.

181
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,292
We really didn't look
at anything,

182
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,294
we just ate your cake, man.

183
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,596
We didn't read the letter
or anything.

184
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,597
‐Kagura!
‐A letter?

185
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,665
Um, here.

186
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,867
It's a little ripped,
but we didn't do it.

187
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,403
It was like that in the first place.

188
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,105
We never opened it or anything.

189
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:25,805
Yeah.

190
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,507
We don't know anything
about a date.

191
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:28,775
‐A date?!
‐Hey!

192
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,512
<i>"Thank you for your kind</i>
<i>help the other day.</i>

193
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,346
<i>I've sent you...</i>

194
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,382
<i>a gift that I believe</i>
<i>will look good on you.</i>

195
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,883
<i>It isn't much at all, but I'd...</i>

196
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,818
<i>be happy if you wore it.</i>

197
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:39,986
<i>And If it's at all possible...</i>

198
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,421
<i>I would love to see you again.</i>

199
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,257
<i>If I could see you again</i>
<i>I could properly thank you</i>

200
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,859
<i>for everything you did for me.</i>

201
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,295
<i>Contact me when you feel like it,</i>
<i>and I'll be waiting for your call.</i>

202
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,431
<i>From Erowitch"</i>

203
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,666
<i>No way!</i>

204
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,035
<i>That girl!</i>
<i>No way!</i>

205
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:55,935
<i>She wants to meet me?</i>

206
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:56,803
<i>Is this a date?</i>

207
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,139
<i>W‐W‐W‐WWhat should I do?</i>

208
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,907
<i>I've never been</i>
<i>on a date before.</i>

209
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,075
<i>I don't know what to do...</i>

210
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:02,842
<i>No way!</i>

211
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,477
<i>To begin with,</i>
<i>is this even really a date?</i>

212
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,046
<i>Okay!</i>

213
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,747
<i>Assuming that this</i>
<i>is really a date,</i>

214
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,815
<i>should I go on a date?</i>

215
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,384
<i>I'm the captain of the</i>
<i>Otsu Terakado Fan Club.</i>

216
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,020
<i>Wait a second, Otsu Terakado's</i>
<i>totally beyond my reach!</i>

217
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,524
<i>Am I going to give up on a date</i>
<i>with a real girl for a pop idol?</i>

218
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,859
<i>Wait, is this even really a date?</i>

219
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:21,728
<i>No, way!</i>

220
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,363
<i>I'm not cheating on Otsu!</i>

221
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,864
<i>This is just research.</i>

222
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,900
<i>The Sergeant was bewitched</i>
<i>by those cat ears,</i>

223
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,468
<i>so I must investigate</i>
<i>and experience</i>

224
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,836
<i>its frightening power</i>
<i>first hand</i>

225
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,405
<i>so such a tragedy will</i>
<i>never happen again!</i>

226
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,306
<i>Yes!</i>

227
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,441
<i>This is only research!</i>

228
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,143
<i>Unfortunately, my experience</i>
<i>in love is ZERO!</i>

229
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,279
<i>There's a strong possibility...</i>

230
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,749
<i>that I'll be shot down before</i>
<i>I fully experience the cat ears.</i>

231
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,718
<i>I need a "How to" book!</i>

232
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,021
<i>But,</i> <i>it's</i> <i>not</i> <i>as</i> <i>if</i> <i>I</i> <i>want</i> <i>her</i>
<i>to</i> <i>like</i> <i>me.</i>

233
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,389
<i>This is just a research!</i>

234
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,458
<i>I need, I need some</i>
<i>"How to" advice</i>

235
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,560
<i>from someone who has</i>
<i>a lot of experience!</i>

236
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,063
<i>But</i> <i>Gin</i> <i>looks</i> <i>like</i> <i>he's</i> <i>never</i> <i>had</i>
<i>a</i> <i>healthy</i> <i>relationship</i>

237
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,298
<i>with anyone in his life...</i>

238
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,767
<i>and Kagura is still just a</i>
<i>little girl who eats a lot.</i>

239
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,003
<i>My sister works at a hostess bar,</i>

240
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,072
<i>but she's a complete amateur</i>
<i>when it comes to love.</i>

241
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,707
<i>She says that she's</i>
<i>going to protect</i>

242
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,242
<i>her virginity until she</i>
<i>gets married...</i>

243
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,077
<i>but</i> <i>she'll</i> <i>probably</i> <i>never</i>
<i>be</i> <i>able</i> <i>to</i> <i>get</i> <i>married!</i>

244
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,479
<i>Aside from them...</i>

245
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,516
<i>Someone</i> <i>close</i> <i>to</i> <i>me</i> <i>that</i>
<i>I</i> <i>can</i> <i>confide</i> <i>in...</i>

246
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,686
There isn't a single person!

247
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,399
<i>I saved a girl from a drunken</i>
<i>molester on the train,</i>

248
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,035
<i>and I'm meeting her because</i>
<i>she says she wants to thank me.</i>

249
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,070
<i>Is this a date?</i>

250
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,906
<i>And what exactly goes</i>
<i>on during a date?</i>

251
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,877
<i>In this case, it's better to get advice</i>
<i>from normal strangers from afar...</i>

252
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,578
<i>than idiots I know nearby.</i>

253
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,715
<i>I'm not good with computers,</i>
<i>but I have no choice.</i>

254
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,451
<i>I can ask for advice from</i>
<i>all sorts of people here,</i>

255
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,753
<i>and I'm too embarrassed to talk</i>
<i>about love to someone I know.</i>

256
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:55,388
Oh!

257
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,823
<i>A message came up already!</i>

258
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:57,724

337
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,436
<i>Are you that afraid of</i>
<i>getting hurt, Train Samurai?</i>

338
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,104
<i>Gin!</i>

339
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,005
<i>Why?</i>

340
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,673
<i>How do you know about this?</i>

341
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,075
<i>Can it be?</i>
<i>Are you here?</i>

342
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,579
<i>There are two things people</i>
<i>are afraid of in life...</i>

343
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,514
<i>death and embarrassment...</i>

344
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,284
<i>Only</i> <i>real</i> <i>fools</i> <i>try</i>
<i>to</i> <i>overcome</i> <i>death...</i>

345
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,219
<i>but...</i>

346
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,655
<i>It takes real guts to conquer</i>
<i>embarrassment.</i>

347
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,257
<i>But I like fools who</i>
<i>take the challenge...</i>

348
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:19,992
<i>So you have to go for it!</i>

349
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,027
<i>Tackle it head‐on!</i>

350
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,962
<i>You have to go for it!</i>

351
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,464
<i>Train Samurai!</i>

352
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,733
<i>Every time you make a</i>
<i>fool of yourself...</i>

353
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,134
<i>it will only make you stronger.</i>

354
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,036
<i>Just go!</i>
<i>Train Samurai!</i>

355
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,277
<i>By the way, I, Gintoki,</i>
<i>got a cute girlfriend that way.</i>

356
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:39,946
<i>‐She's an assassin...</i>

357
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,482
<i>She wears glasses and is</i>
<i>incredibly cute, too.</i>

358
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,283
<i>Seriously, she's by my side...</i>

359
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,451
<i>begging me to feed her...</i>

360
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,853
<i>right at this moment.</i>

361
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,821
<i>Xoxoxoxo...</i>

362
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,125
<i>By the way...</i>

363
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,693
<i>anyone who sees this message</i>

364
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,262
<i>has to make 10,000 post</i>
<i>in the thread titled</i>

365
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,864
<i>"Sacchan is going out with Gin."</i>

366
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,800
<i>If not, Sacchan will kill you</i>
<i>four days later at midnight.</i>

367
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,002
<i>This is no joke.</i>

368
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,270
<i>One of my friends went missing</i>

369
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,472
<i>on the fourth day after</i>
<i>reading this message.</i>

370
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,474
‐Is this for real!?
‐Is this for real!?

371
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,176
<i>Hey!</i>

372
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,611
<i>Fruit Punch, did you see that?</i>

373
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,247
<i>If you did, well, maybe</i>
<i>we can work together.</i>

374
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,616
<i>We could split and each</i>
<i>write 5,000 messages!</i>

375
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,450
<i>Good idea...</i>

376
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,118
<i>We need to discuss the details.</i>

377
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,653
<i>Why don't we meet in person.</i>

378
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,054
<i>Tomorrow at 1 PM.</i>

379
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,190
<i>I'll</i> <i>be</i> <i>waiting</i> <i>in</i> <i>front</i> <i>of</i>
<i>Statue</i> <i>of</i> <i>Slippery.</i>

380
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:25,691
<i>All right.</i>

381
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,660
<i>I'll</i> <i>have</i> <i>a</i> <i>fruit</i> <i>punch</i>
<i>in</i> <i>my</i> <i>left</i> <i>hand.</i>

382
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,496
<i>You</i> <i>wait</i> <i>there</i> <i>with</i> <i>a</i> <i>fruit</i> <i>punch</i>
<i>in</i> <i>your</i> <i>right</i> <i>hand.</i>

383
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,398
<i>All right, let's do it!</i>

384
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,201
‐Oh, no!!
‐Oh, no!!

385
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,945
Hey, hey, does he think
he's going into

386
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,280
a warzone or something?

387
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,715
He sure is giving
off a weird vibe.

388
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:50,883
Well, now I get it.

389
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,619
So this is why he was
acting so strangely lately.

390
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,887
According to the letter,

391
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,689
the girl should be showing
up any minute now.

392
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,124
And so that's that.

393
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,592
Everyone feeling better now?

394
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,961
Let's go and let them
have their date already.

395
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,296
No way.

396
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,299
That girl may be Shinpachi's
future bride, and I want to see...

397
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,201
if she's right for him
with my own eyes.

398
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,802
Don't get so ahead of yourself.

399
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,271
You're acting like a
sister‐in‐law already.

400
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,141
This girl had better not try anything
funny when she meets him!

401
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,777
What if she tries to hold his
hand or gaze at him?

402
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:18,978
Come on!

403
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,079
That's what you do on a date!

404
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,114
Oh! Look there,
here she comes!

405
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,384
Shinpachi!

406
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,724
I'm very sorry.

407
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,960
Did I make you wait for long?

408
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,162
Hey...

409
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,296
What is that?

410
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,031
She actually has cat ears!

411
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,933
I never heard anything
about that!

412
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,235
Well, you know, they say...

413
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,036
love transcends even the stars.

414
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,338
No way, mister!

415
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,639
I absolutely hate cats!

416
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,907
‐I like dogs much better!
‐Wait! Wait!

417
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,476
Dogs and cats are pretty similar.

418
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,479
Those might actually be dog ears,
you never know, Otae.

419
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,616
If she's a dog, then that means
they're going to have a dog baby.

420
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,351
The baby would be dog ugly!

421
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,319
Who knows, it might be
cute as a Chihuahua!

422
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,487
Did you ever think of that?

423
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,789
You know you're way too
attached to your brother!

424
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:05,791
I always thought it
was Shinpachi

425
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,827
who depended on you
too much, but no!

426
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,395
He's a grown up man!

427
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,162
Give him some privacy!

428
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,797
I respect his privacy!

429
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,700
I just enjoy reading his diary
and chats from time to time.

430
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,335
That is going way too far!

431
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,840
Excuse me, are you
Fruit Punch Samurai?

432
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,176
Oh, wow, you were
right next to me.

433
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,679
Well, you told me you were going
to hold your fruit punch

434
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,414
in your left hand, but you
were holding it in your right.

435
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,782
Oh, I'm sorry.

436
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,951
I meant "left" from
your perspective.

437
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,288
Well, I'm sorry for being
so rude in cyber space.

438
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,623
I am the Fruit Punch Samurai.

439
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,792
This is going to be a nightmare.

440
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,929
How can we possibly write
10,000 letters in three days?

441
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,997
Oh, by the way, I am Fruit Hump.

442
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,916
And here is your lemon tea.

443
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,451
Enjoy.

444
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,153
Don't you think...

445
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,188
following them to a
place like this...

446
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,623
is kind of nosy?

447
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,058
We shouldn't be
sticking our necks

448
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,492
into someone
else's love life.

449
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,193
‐Be quiet!
‐Be quiet!

450
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,494
‐You can't capture a scandal
‐The future of the Shimura

451
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,395
‐without a little sweat!
‐family is at stake.

452
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,196
Shut up!

453
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,231
Can you to stop talk
at the same time?

454
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,567
What's up with
those people, Shinpachi?

455
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,437
Oh, Shinpachi!

456
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,272
That's your eye, Shinpachi...

457
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,142
Shinpachi!

458
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,613
Are you all right?

459
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,847
What's the matter?

460
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,649
You haven't burned yourself,
have you?

461
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,950
N‐No.

462
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,151
I'm all right.

463
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,587
<i>No, I'm not all right at all.</i>

464
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,223
<i>‐Your fervent gaze..</i>
<i>‐What's wrong Shinpatchi?</i>

465
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,092
<i>has scorched my</i>
<i>heart to charcoal.</i>

466
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,961
<i>Crap!</i>
<i>That's dirty, damn cat‐ears!</i>

467
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,231
<i>Why are such cute things</i>
<i>on such a cute girl?</i>

468
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,233
<i>They're like a secret weapon.</i>

469
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,603
<i>Well, that's a weapon as well</i>
<i>but in a different kind of way.</i>

470
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,571
<i>Sergeant!</i>

471
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,674
<i>Right now, I understand why</i>
<i>you fell for those cat ears.</i>

472
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,509
<i>Cat ears are amazing!</i>

473
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,910
<i>Praise the cat ears!</i>

474
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,278
<i>I am such an idiot!</i>

475
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,014
<i>I didn't understand anything.</i>

476
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,916
<i>I was the one who needed to be</i>
<i>taught a lesson, Sergeant.</i>

477
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,919
<i>I'm such a coward.</i>

478
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,254
<i>I really...</i>

479
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,890
<i>have</i> <i>no</i> <i>right</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>with</i>
<i>a</i> <i>girl</i> <i>at</i> <i>all.</i>

480
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,959
Umm, Shinpachi.

481
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,028
Thank you very much
for the other day.

482
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,162
I didn't...

483
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,730
I didn't think you would
really come,

484
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,232
so I'm really happy...

485
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,234
I just wanted to meet you
and thank you...

486
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,735
Or rather, I actually...

487
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,404
I wanted to meet you and...

488
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,238
Once more...

489
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,073
I just can't believe
you're even here.

490
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,941
Hey, uh...
that's your eye...

491
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,076
Oh no!

492
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,477
What am I doing?
I didn't mean to.

493
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,546
Oh, I'm sorry.

494
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:41,881
What's gotten into me?

495
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:43,716
That's so odd.

496
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:47,453
My heart is just racing so fast
right now, silly meow!

497
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,156
Sto‐op!

498
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,657
Please stop...

499
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,859
<i>Stop making such cute gestures!</i>

500
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,361
<i>It's getting to me...</i>

501
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,464
You're hitting all my pressure
points just like a chiropractor.

502
00:19:58,464 --> 00:19:59,632
What are you doing?

503
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,133
I notice that you're wearing...

504
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,868
the cat ears that I gave you.

505
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,136
And I'm so glad!

506
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,905
I took the time to pick
them out myself.

507
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,706
It's always been my dream
to walk with someone

508
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,742
I admire wearing
matching cat‐ears...

509
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:10,676
Oops!

510
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,078
<i>I actually said it.</i>

511
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,747
What are you two doing?

512
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:15,981
Hey, cut it out.

513
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:17,383
Are you lis...

514
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,252
What is this?
What is this feeling?

515
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,488
That girl is really getting
on my nerves!

516
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,190
What do I do?
What should I do?

517
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,158
There's something
black in my heart!

518
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,059
Get rid of it!

519
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,028
Purge the darkness!

520
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,330
Uh.

521
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,632
It's not such a big deal,
taking a walk together.

522
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,835
So, why don't we go
do that right now?

523
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:36,902
Really?

524
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,304
Is that all right?

525
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,506
Thank goodness
I gathered up my courage.

526
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,907
Oh my!

527
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,410
I'm so happy my sight
is getting blurry.

528
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,179
‐Shall I make you blind forever?!
‐Why are you beating me?

529
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,614
Go attack her!

530
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,715
Attack her, not me!

531
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,318
Umm...
Is it okay if I hold your hand?

532
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,752
Oh...
Well...

533
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:54,553
Uh, yeah.

534
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,488
Here.

535
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,829
<i>No matter how I look at this,</i>
<i>this is a date.</i>

536
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,132
<i>We're holding hands...</i>

537
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,700
<i>and my heart is racing.</i>

538
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,837
<i>We ended up wandering</i>
<i>down an awkward street.</i>

539
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:12,938
<i>On no...</i>

540
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:15,474
<i>She might think that I want</i>
<i>to be alone with her...</i>

541
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,910
<i>or that I want to go somewhere</i>
<i>private or something.</i>

542
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:22,815
U‐Umm, hey, Erowitch,
this street isn't very interesting.

543
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,884
Why don't we go down
a main road?

544
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:30,022
Shinpachi, I think I got a little too
excited, I'm feeling a bit tired now.

545
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,525
My house is really close by.

546
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,559
Would you...

547
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,194
care to go there to rest?

548
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,662
My parents...

549
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,264
aren't home,
it'll be just us.

550
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,167
<i>Really?</i>

551
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,735
<i>No way!</i>
<i>What?</i>

552
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:43,869
<i>This already?</i>

553
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,504
<i>We've just met.</i>

554
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:46,972
What should I do?

555
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,407
<i>‐Is that what's going on?</i>
‐I said it... Oh dear...

556
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,976
<i>I've heard that young people</i>
<i>these days are wild,</i>

557
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,812
<i>but this is as wild as the battles</i>
<i>between feudal lords!</i>

558
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,115
<i>I can't do it!</i>
<i>I can't do it!</i>

559
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:59,185
<i>I'd</i> <i>be</i> <i>glad</i> <i>if</i> <i>I</i> <i>can</i> <i>do</i> <i>it</i>
<i>with</i> <i>a</i> <i>cute</i> <i>girl</i> <i>like</i> <i>her.</i>

560
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,153
<i>But I'm still just a boy...</i>

561
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,222
<i>and</i> <i>kids</i> <i>are</i> <i>also</i>
<i>watching</i> <i>this</i> <i>show!</i>

562
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,724
<i>The</i> <i>show's</i> <i>ratings</i>
<i>are</i> <i>already</i> <i>in danger.</i>

563
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,328
<i>If</i> <i>the</i> <i>Parent</i> <i>Teacher</i> <i>Association</i>
<i>sends</i> <i>in</i> <i>flood</i> <i>of</i> <i>complaints...</i>

564
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,597
<i>that</i> <i>will</i> <i>be</i> <i>the</i> <i>end</i>
<i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>show</i> <i>forever!</i>

565
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,934
What?

566
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,168
What's the matter?

567
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:17,903
Is there something wrong
with my house?

568
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,972
N‐No!
Not at all!

569
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,240
Well then...

570
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:26,178
Oh no!

571
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,580
This is bad!
Not good!

572
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,782
The show's going to end
if I don't do something.

573
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:33,719
The...

574
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,920
shower's open.

575
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,488
I'll be waiting...

576
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,656
in the bed for you...

577
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:38,824
Forever.

578
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,995
I don't care about
the show ending!

579
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:45,464
I won't back down
after coming this far!

580
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,566
Who cares if kids are
watching this show!

581
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,501
The staff will probably
just cover the scene

582
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,238
<i>with a simple illustration</i>
<i>of a stamen and a pistil!</i>

583
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:53,372
<i>It'll be all right!</i>

584
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,807
It'll definitely be all right!

585
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,276
Because I...

586
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,777
<i>Shinpachi Shimura...</i>

587
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,547
<i>will at last become a real man!</i>

588
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:37,976
<i>Oh no!</i>

589
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,044
<i>We've run out of time!</i>

590
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,280
<i>We're going to continue</i>
<i>this in the next episode!</i>

591
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,615
<i>It's disgraceful for a man</i>
<i>to turn down a woman!</i>

592
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:44,583
<i>You wanna know the details?</i>

593
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,818
<i>I can't tell you now!</i>
