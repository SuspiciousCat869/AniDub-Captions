1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,037
Go home.

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:04,872
Huh?

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,476
The Earth seems way too
small for you, Kagura...

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,211
This is a good opportunity.

5
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,946
Go home with your father...

6
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,582
Let's make this a good‐bye.

7
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,586
But why?

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,655
Why are you saying that to me?

9
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,891
I'm never going back home,
I'm staying...

10
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:27,227
Staying here forever
with you and the others...

11
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,329
Oh.
Wait, don't go!

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,464
Stop it!

13
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,066
Think about it, Kagura...

14
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:36,203
This isn't where you belong,
and you know that it's true.

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,411
Why, Gin...?

16
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,146
Why, Gin...?

17
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,448
But why...?

18
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,732
Hey little girl...

19
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,402
what are you doing in a
place like this?

20
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,837
Why don't you
come with us, huh?

21
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,506
We take good care...

22
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:55,275
of little kids like you
who have nowhere to go,

23
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,177
and then we sell you
to new parents.

24
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,346
We're very kind like that,
little girl...

25
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,583
Hey, little girl.

26
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:11,925
Hey young lady...

27
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,727
what're you doing in a
place like this?

28
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,329
Without an umbrella
on a day like this.

29
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,965
It's raining, so I don't need it.

30
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,967
Don't be ridiculous.

31
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,236
Umbrellas are supposed
to be used for rainy days

32
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,304
so you won't get wet.

33
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,373
If I use my umbrella
on rainy days,

34
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,642
I won't ever be able
to see the sky...

35
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,045
I want to be able to see the sky,
even if it's raining.

36
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,082
You'll catch cold.

37
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,051
Papa!

38
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:44,391
<i>It was a humid city where it rained</i>
<i>constantly all year long...</i>

39
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,226
<i>That was our nest...</i>

40
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,263
<i>A district where</i>
<i>only the vigilant</i>

41
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,998
<i>and unscrupulous</i>
<i>could survive...</i>

42
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,103
<i>It may have seemed like</i>
<i>a dirty sewer to others...</i>

43
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,040
<i>but it was a great place</i>
<i>to live, for sewer rats.</i>

44
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,679
Papa, when will you come
home next?

45
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,582
I just got home and you're
already asking me that?

46
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,252
Don't leave me anymore, Papa...

47
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,421
I don't want...

48
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,457
to see Mama always
being so sad anymore.

49
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,759
Big brother won't come home,

50
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,628
and you rarely
come home either...

51
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,763
And I'm very lonely.

52
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,135
<i>Your mama will get better...</i>

53
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,569
<i>very soon, I'm sure...</i>

54
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,105
<i>Your big brother will be</i>
<i>back soon too...</i>

55
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,074
<i>Until then, I have to make money,</i>

56
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,775
<i>and you have to watch</i>
<i>over your mama...</i>

57
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,944
<i>We made a promise, remember?</i>

58
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,747
<i>How many times...</i>

59
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,682
<i>did</i> <i>I</i> <i>tell</i> <i>her</i> <i>that</i> <i>only</i>
<i>to</i> <i>leave</i> <i>her</i>

60
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,417
<i>in</i> <i>that</i> <i>hellhole</i>
<i>again</i> <i>and</i> <i>again?</i>

61
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,386
<i>And even so...</i>

62
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,955
<i>she always waited for me</i>
<i>to come back home</i>

63
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,724
<i>with a smile for her</i>
<i>no‐good father...</i>

64
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,325
<i>In the end...</i>

65
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,462
<i>we</i> <i>just</i> <i>kept</i> <i>repeating</i> <i>this</i> <i>scene</i>
<i>until</i> <i>her</i> <i>mother</i> <i>died...</i>

66
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,598
<i>I</i> <i>was</i> <i>never</i> <i>able</i> <i>to</i> <i>make</i>
<i>a</i> <i>warm</i> <i>nest</i> <i>for</i> <i>her...</i>

67
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,104
<i>That's why you must have come</i>
<i>to this distant planet...</i>

68
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,072
<i>to find your own nest.</i>

69
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,642
<i>All passengers, please check...</i>

70
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,809
We're taking off very soon.

71
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,645
Get ready to go, Kagura.

72
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,550
How cold of them, right?

73
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,151
You were with them
all the time,

74
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,819
and they don't even
come to see you off...

75
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,922
I guess you were the only one...

76
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,256
who felt close to them.

77
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,325
But they didn't feel the
same way about you.

78
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,398
Listen, the Earth seems way
too small for you, Kagura....

79
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,967
Letâ€™s make this a good‐bye.

80
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,806
Well, that's how
it always goes...

81
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,474
When it comes to
beasts like us,

82
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,476
people either use us,
or they hate us,

83
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,644
it's one or the other...

84
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,146
It seems that...

85
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,748
they saw us fighting and
they just chickened out.

86
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,919
<i>I'm sorry, Kagura...</i>

87
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,689
<i>I never wanted to see that look</i>
<i>on your face again...</i>

88
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,991
<i>This is all my fault...</i>

89
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,127
<i>Please let me make amends...</i>

90
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,831
<i>I won't ever let you feel</i>
<i>lonely ever again...</i>

91
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,801
Even if we cannot live
under the sunshine..

92
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,303
<i>we can still live under</i>
<i>the light of the moon...</i>

93
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:12,572
Kagura...

94
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,974
I will protect you...

95
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,443
And make this up to you,
and your mother.

96
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,645
You stink.

97
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:19,813
<i>Huh?</i>

98
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,214
<i>You fired her?!</i>

99
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,449
Keep it down, will you?

100
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,017
Stop talking so loud...

101
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,386
Ah!
Now look what you did.

102
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,221
I clipped my toenail too short!

103
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,056
You actually fired Kagura?

104
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,958
Uh, does that mean Kagura...

105
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,426
went home with her father?

106
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:34,728
How should I know?

107
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:35,962
I guess she went home?

108
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,365
It's already been a long day,
so good for her.

109
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,667
She always said she was saving
up money to go home,

110
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,269
so this saves her the trouble...

111
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,338
And another thing,
she may be a little girl,

112
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,307
but she still shouldn't be living
in some house

113
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,842
with two random guys...

114
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,877
She's lucky that
I was a gentleman.

115
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,479
Because nowadays
you never know

116
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,748
when you're gonna meet some
sleaze ball whose a pedophile...

117
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:55,915
If I was her father,

118
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,917
I'm sure I'd kill the
guy she was living with.

119
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,453
I'd stick my fingers up his nose
and throw him across the roo‐‐.

120
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,636
Owowowow!

121
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,704
You broke it off!

122
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,571
You tore my nose off!

123
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,439
What'd you do that for?

124
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,441
I'm so disappointed in you Gin!

125
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,142
Seriously!

126
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,244
Haven't you even thought
about Kagura's feelings?

127
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,178
Huh?

128
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,947
What's so bad about returning
a runaway girl to her father?

129
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,016
You really are stupid!

130
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,352
Hopeless!
Truly hopeless!

131
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,920
Hey, you hopeless four eyes!

132
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,289
Shall I bust those specs of yours
and make you just hopeless?

133
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,258
You don't understand
anything at all!

134
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,227
You have no idea how much
Kagura cherished this place!

135
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:44,531
Even if the wind blows and all
the other branches break off.

136
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,833
I'll stick with the tree until
the very end!

137
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,668
Kagura really...

138
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,403
thought so much of you...

139
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,839
You don't have to tell us that.

140
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,108
We are already living
the way that we want to.

141
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,610
We came here because
we wanted to.

142
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,812
‐We came here because
‐We came here because

143
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,180
‐we want to be with you.
‐we want to be with you.

144
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,148
Forget it...

145
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,517
If that's how you feel
about us, Gin...

146
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:05,919
then I'm quitting, too...

147
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,689
Seems like we were
the only ones...

148
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,458
who thought that
we were friends.

149
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,460
If you want to quit, then quit...

150
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,794
I don't remember...

151
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,764
ever asking you or Kagura
to come here anyway.

152
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,036
Ow‐ow‐ow‐ow‐ow...

153
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,204
my back...

154
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,373
What is it, what's the deal
with you all of you?

155
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,145
What's that,
got a problem, too?

156
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,980
Be good or I won't
feed you, huh?

157
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,885
If you want to leave,
you can go right ahead then...

158
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:41,888
What?

159
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:42,989
You won't find her there....

160
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,427
you're a sharp one, aren't you?

161
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,964
It was better this way wasn't it?

162
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,265
I don't really know much about

163
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,768
father‐daughter relationship
kind of things...

164
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,604
But it must be better this way.

165
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,908
<i>Please be aware that this craft</i>
<i>may rock or sway during transport...</i>

166
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,344
<i>Please fasten your seatbelts securely</i>
<i>around your waist</i>

167
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,413
<i>and please remain seated</i>
<i>until the light goes off</i>

168
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,448
<i>letting you know</i>
<i>it's safe to get up.</i>

169
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,884
Sir, you can't,
you have to sit down!

170
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,419
This ship will be leaving shortly,

171
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,420
and you must remain seated

172
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,688
until we reach
stable airspace, please!

173
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,056
No, no, no, Listen...

174
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,060
there's a Titanic in my stomach
that's about to leave too!

175
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,595
‐Bon voyage!
‐No, sir, that's not funny at all.

176
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,564
I'm gonna crap in
my pants right now!

177
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:25,565
Attention please!

178
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,766
Going through poopoolance!

179
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,868
Sir, please stop trying to be funny!

180
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,537
Unbuckle my butt belt!

181
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,074
ahh...it came out.

182
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,241
Get on with it!

183
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,477
Move it, you good for
nothing assholes!

184
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:38,578
That container goes here!

185
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,580
That goes there!
That goes there!

186
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,348
And that one there!
What is this place?

187
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,350
Uh...
This is the luggage bay.

188
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,086
Who is that bossy old man?

189
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,823
He's, you know,
a butler of that prince.

190
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,858
The idiotic prince
of the Midland Star.

191
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,128
So all this creepy cargo belongs
to that idiot prince?

192
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,830
He has terrible taste doesn't he?

193
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,232
No wonder everyone calls him
Prince Caca.

194
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,134
Be very careful with that!

195
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,570
These are all the Prince's
precious treasures.

196
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,605
If you put so much as
a scratch on them,

197
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,907
I, G the great will make sure
you'll be torn up

198
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,409
both physically and mentally.

199
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,710
‐Yes, sir.
‐Okay,

200
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,612
I'm going to go back
to my seat now.

201
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,647
If you talk shit about me
behind my back,

202
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,216
I swear I'll break your necks!

203
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,250
So watch out.

204
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,585
Whoa!

205
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,385
What?

206
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,787
What the hell man?

207
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,722
What've you done to the
Prince's treasure?!

208
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,725
Who put this junk
right in my way!

209
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:26,893
Did you just say junk?

210
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,095
You just called your Prince's
treasure junk!

211
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,830
Stop making such a scene!

212
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,066
It's not like he's not going to notice
one piece of junk missing,

213
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,267
you asshole!

214
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,836
Old fart, you know you're
really out of your mind!

215
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,404
Just shut up and clean this up!

216
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,473
It'll be a pain in the ass
if that idiot finds out.

217
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,641
Go get a mop and bring it here.

218
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,909
Huh?
That's odd.

219
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,778
Hey, where is the thing
that was inside this thing?

220
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:46,679
What?

221
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:47,647
How would we know?

222
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,549
Are you sure there was
something inside?

223
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,418
There should've been something
similar to those things in there.

224
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:53,520
What?

225
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:54,988
A monster like these?!

226
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:55,989
That's very odd.

227
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,359
How could a corpse
disappear by itself, huh?

228
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,695
Just stop it right there.

229
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,097
You can't go in there.

230
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,399
Sir, you can't go through
here without a ticket!

231
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,301
‐Stop, or we'll call the police!
‐Wait up! Listen to me!

232
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,669
Just listen to me, please!

233
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,237
My, uh, it's my girlfriend!

234
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,207
My girlfriend was kidnapped by
an old guy with a comb‐over...

235
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,043
and the two of them are trying
to run off on their honeymoon.

236
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,144
There's no way!

237
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,814
You look like you never had a
girlfriend for sixteen years!

238
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,416
And what the hell is that
supposed to mean?!

239
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,918
How do you even know
my age?

240
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,085
Okay, I lied, I lied.

241
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,654
I was just trying to make
myself look good.

242
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,422
The truth is, the comb over
is my father.

243
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,357
He was tricked by a young girl
looking for a sugar daddy,

244
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,359
dumped his family, and now he's
about to commit suicide with her.

245
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,294
Don't lie to me!

246
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,396
You look like your father
already died!

247
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,864
How in the world
did you know that?

248
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,232
How come you know that?

249
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,368
<i>Kagura...</i>

250
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:43,937
<i>I don't know...</i>

251
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,972
<i>what kind of life</i>
<i>you led before...</i>

252
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,075
<i>And I don't know how you feel</i>

253
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:50,810
<i>But...</i>

254
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,880
<i>I</i> <i>do</i> <i>know</i> <i>how</i> <i>much</i> <i>you</i>

255

<i>I</i> <i>know</i> <i>how</i> <i>much</i> <i>you</i> <i>think</i>
<i>about</i> <i>Gin,</i> <i>too,</i> <i>I</i> <i>know...</i>

256
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,687
<i>I know, because...</i>

257
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,654
<i>because...</i>

258
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,490
I feel the same way!

259
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,093
I'm so sorry!

260
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,763
<i>The three of us, together forever...</i>

261
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,999
<i>I know that isn't possible...</i>

262
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,768
<i>Someday...</i>

263
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,404
<i>Someday,</i> <i>I</i> <i>know</i> <i>we'd</i> <i>have</i>
<i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>apart...</i>

264
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,306
<i>But right now...</i>

265
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,609
Man, that was an
awful experience...

266
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,444
Let me tell you about it, Kagura...

267
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,145
Kagura?

268
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,181
<i>Right now, I still...</i>

269
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:31,851
Hey...

270
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:32,619
Hey!

271
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:33,720
What is that?!

272
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:35,488
It's a man!

273
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,557
There's a man climbing
the ladder!

274
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,228
Hold on!
Hold on, please!

275
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,397
Kagura, tell me,
where are you going?

276
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,933
Odd Jobs is all about the three
of us working together!

277
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,768
Whatever Gin said to you,
ignore him!

278
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,670
He's a moron, you know that!

279
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,672
He doesn't even pay you
a decent salary!

280
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,008
I can't handle that idiot
all by myself!

281
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,576
I need you back
at Odd Jobs!

282
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,311
Please come back, Kagura!

283
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,646
That hopeless four eyes!

284
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,180
He really is so stupid!

285
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,549
Shinpachi...

286
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,652
Shinpachi...

287
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,955
Shinpa...

288
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:13,926
Papa!

289
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,328
This is bad...

290
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,529

291
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,664

What the hell is that?!

296
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,393
Wait, is it coming this way?!

297
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,695
Don't tell me it's
coming this way!?

298
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:49,896
It's coming this way,
isnt't it?

299
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,764
Oh God! It's coming
this way!

300
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,400
Alien?

301
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,568
Never heard the word.

302
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,537
It sounds like it's some
kind of exotic fruit.

303
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,072
Is that a Durian, huh?

304
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,573
There's no way...

305
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,742
we're handing Earth over to
the likes of you, bozos!

306
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,111
Earth belongs strictly
to us gangsters!

307
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:07,980
What, you'll what?

308
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,015
Uh then, I'll do...

309
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,283
something terrible!

310
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,384
You're, you know what...

311
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,585
don't you dare...

312
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,320
if you do that sort of thing, uh?

313
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,389
You naughty boy!

314
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,424

Who'd want to come inside with
this crappy advertisement, man?

321
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,505
Look at you losers!

322
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,174
Were you even listening to me
when we went over the script?

323
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:35,908
What's up with!

324
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,276
"You naughty boy"?

325
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,614
You think standing there frozen
is gonna impress me?

You guys only take the parts that
don't matter seriously don't you!

Forget it, you guys.

329
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,559
Just shut up and hold
the damned flags.

Hey, there, Gin, what happened
to the others anyway?

333
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,103
That dull four‐eyes
that Super human girl?

334
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,671
With their help, it would be...

335
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:06,639
How would I know?

336
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,575
I can do anything myself even
if they aren't around here...

337
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,210
And why is that?

338
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,912
Because I'm a Jack of all trades!

339
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,783
Hey, hey, it's more like Jack of no
trades, if we're being honest...

340

Hey, Hasegawa, the boss
is calling for you.

341
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:20,620
What?

342
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,487
This isn't good.

343
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,924
He said if we didn't show results,
that he'd fire us on the spot.

344
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,427
No point bringing in a crowd today,
anyway, you see?

345
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:32,064
Nobody's gonna want to come and
see fake aliens in the movies...

346
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,533
Look there.

347
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,736
We got a very real alien
to worry about in Edo City.

348
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,371
Hey, hey, where is that?

349
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,572
Is that the sky terminal?

350
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,108
It seems like a huge alien
took over a ship

351
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,443
at the sky terminal and
caused an accident.

352
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,580
<i>Come</i> <i>on!</i> <i>Can't</i> <i>the</i> <i>camera</i>
<i>get</i> <i>any</i> <i>closer?</i>

353
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,281
<i>I'm sorry, uh.</i>

354
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,515
<i>Please take a look at this!</i>

355
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,551
<i>A mysterious creature</i>
<i>has caused an accident</i>

356
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,553
<i>involving a ship inside</i>
<i>the terminal.</i>

357
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,655
<i>You can see the nose of</i>
<i>the crashed spaceship</i>

358
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,789
<i>is crashing through</i>
<i>the terminal wall.</i>

359
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,224
It's so frightening.

360
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,359
<i>There is concern for the</i>
<i>safety of the passengers.</i>

361
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,029
<i>But</i> <i>what</i> <i>exactly</i> <i>is</i> <i>this</i>
<i>sinister</i> <i>creature?</i> <i>Huh?</i>

362
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:03,996
<i>Just a minute...</i>

363
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,431
<i>Is, is that a person?</i>

364
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,766
<i>I'm positive it is.</i>

365
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,534
<i>It is a man!</i>

366
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,735
<i>A man!</i>

367
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:10,536
<i>Huh?</i>

368
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:11,904
<i>A young girl?</i>

369
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:12,605
<i>Oh my gosh.</i>

370
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,573
<i>It's a young girl!</i>

371
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,374
<i>A young girl is on the</i>
<i>spaceship's hull,</i>

372
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,543
<i>and it looks as if she's</i>
<i>fighting all by herself!</i>

373
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,111
<i>‐I don't believe it...</i>
‐H‐Hey...

374
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,513
<i>‐I don't believe it.</i>
‐Gin is... Is that...!

375
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,315
<i>How is she doing that?</i>
<i>Is she really human?!</i>

376
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:24,984
Hey...

377
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,018
Hey...

378
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,253
Pull yourself together...

379
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,054
boy...

380
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,355
Hey.

381
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,758
Hang on, am I in heaven?

382
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,293
I don't see any flower garden.

383
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,728
All I see is a burnt hilltop.

384
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,696
Burnt hilltop?

385
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,897
Are you describing my hair?

386
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,998
You want to go to heaven?

387
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,467
Would you rather live happily
ever after in the flower gardens?

388
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,702
Mr. Umibozu.

389
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,337
If you've come to your
senses, then...

390
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,005
get outta here, boy...

391
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,608
Or you'll be killed
by that creature...

392
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,977
Who'd have thought
it'd still be alive?

393
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,479
And where'd it get the nutrients
to get that big...

394
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,314
I should've made sure
he was dead.

395
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,750
It'll engulf this place very soon...

396
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,018
Get going now.

397
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,286
Mr. Baldy?

398
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,556
Who the hell are you calling
"Baldy", huh?

399
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,759
I still have few hairs left!

400
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,861
I don't see Kagura anywhere...

401
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,063
Knowing her she probably
remained on the ship

402
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,098
in order to rescue people.

403
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:12,798
Hang on...

404
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:13,699
I'm coming too...

405
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,234
I just can't leave...

406
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,536
Kagura up there.

407
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:19,672
Go home!

408
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,606
Go!

409
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,608
You'll just get in the way here.

410
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,543
From this point on,
it's a battlefield,

411
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,646
and weak life forms like you
only get in the way...

412
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,381
This is where..

413
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,849
we truly belong.

414
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:31,817
Those eyes...

415
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:33,419
But wait, look, I...

416
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,077
I already told you that we live
in a different world!

417
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,614
Forget about Kagura, now.

418
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,616
You'll only torment Kagura...

419
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,619
Do you think people can
change so easily?

420
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,522
No way...

421
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,090
people can't change...

422
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:13,993
<i>We struggled and struggled,</i>

423
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,728
<i>but in the end,</i>
<i>we couldn't change...</i>

424
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,431
<i>We tried so hard but couldn't</i>
<i>change anything...</i>

425
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:21,367
<i>If it causes only pain,</i>
<i>it's better to...</i>

426
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,075
‐Help us!
‐Please help us!

427
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,177
Quickly!
Come this way!

428
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,717
There it is, there is the alien!

429
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,219
It has swelled into an
enormous giant being

430
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,554
and seems to be growing!

431
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:42,622
This is dangerous.

432
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:43,623
Way too dangerous!

433
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,625
I must evacuate
right this minute.

434
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:46,892
Hey!

435
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:47,693
It's dangerous.

436
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:48,694
Clear out of here!
Oh!

437
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,396
It's the Shinsengumi.

438
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,331
The guardians of Edo City,

439
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,033
the Shinsengumi
armed police force

440
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,268
have arrived on the scene,
oh thank God!

441
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,437
<i>Alien!</i>

442
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,606
<i>You are completely surrounded...</i>

443
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,775
<i>so just give up and surrender.</i>

444
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,543
Wait, but, what‐what are you doing?

445
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,612
<i>Your</i> <i>mother</i> <i>from</i> <i>your</i>
<i>home</i> <i>planet</i> <i>is</i> <i>crying!</i>

446
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,181
<i>She's saying she didn't raise</i>
<i>you to be this kind of alien.</i>

447
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,483
Right, mother?

448
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,184
Say something to your child.

449
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,519
Wait?
Seriously?!

450
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:16,889
Listen here!

451
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,492
Do you know what your daddy
said just before he died?

452
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,128
You know your daddy cared
about you until the very end.

453
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,399
What the hell are you
guys doing?!

454
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,768
The government specified

455
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:31,470
this Sky Terminal the "Architectural
Landmark" of the Capital.

456
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,607
If we shoot at it without permission,
we'll all lose our jobs.

457
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,175
This is no time for that!

458
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,711
You'll lose millions of lives
if you don't do something!

459
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,646
Hey! If you don't
get away quickly,

460
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,248
you'll get killed!
What is it with you?

461
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,783
You're going to leave
the citizens to die

462
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,017
while you escape
in a patrol car?!

463
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,252
What's with you people?!

464
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,721
I never imagined that thing
would still be alive.

465
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,489
I don't know how it
even ended up here,

466
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,992
but it's sure turned into
a major disaster...

467
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,961
Seems it's tougher than
we ever imagined,

468
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,365
and it seems like it gets bigger
and bigger the more it eats...

469
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,200
What makes it worse is

470
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,803
that it's taken over
the sky terminal this time.

471
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,138
Incredible amounts of energy

472
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,808
pump through the terminal
in order to teleport ships...

473
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,343
The thing sucked up
immense energy

474
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,345
flowing through the terminal,
and suddenly

475
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,481
expanded into gigantic size!

476
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,383
This is very bad.

477
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,052
At this rate, the entire
City of Edo will be devoured.

478
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,887
Uh!
Dammit, what are you shooting?!

479
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,392
Oh, I'm so afraid!

480
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,561
What's going to happen
to Edo City?

481
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,663
What's going to happen to me?

482
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,364
I'm unemployed again.

483
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:33,666
Why should I care

484
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,367
‐if Edo City gets destroyed?
<i>‐What's that over there?</i>

485
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,203
<i>Something's coming this way...</i>

486
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,071
<i>flying past the fleeing crowd...</i>

487
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:41,841
<i>Is that a...</i>

488
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,075
a dog?

489
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,343
No...

490
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:45,578
a samurai?!

491
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,446
Bossman?!

492
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,881
What are you... doing?

493
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,282
Oh! Is this a camera?

494
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,417
A TV camera?

495
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,418
Okay.

496
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,453
Come see,
"Aliens vs. Gangster".

497
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:55,988
<i>Playing in theaters now.</i>

498
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,056
<i>Don't miss it.</i>

499
00:20:58,491 --> 00:20:59,458
What just happened?!

500
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:00,893
Who is that mysterious man?!

501
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,929
<i>Wait!</i>
<i>It's dangerous over there!</i>

502
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:06,031
Oh, Gin, you're too late.

503
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,900
We've already been fired.

504
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,202
Kagura!

505
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,270
Where are you?

506
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,771
You're Papa's right here!

507
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,442
This is very bad...

508
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,178
This is the most life
threatening situation

509
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,147
since the battle with the
giant cocker‐oach.

510
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,882
No wait, since the fight
I had with my wife

511
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,183
when we just got married...

512
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,654
Oh, you're that guy that
looks like a manager,

513
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,089
the one who
was taking a dump...

514
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,957
Hang in there,
assistant manager...

515
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,193
Hey, what's with the
sudden demotion?

516
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,194
Are you all right?

517
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,629
How'd you get that thing
on your forehead?

518
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:37,830
Did the alien do that to you?

519
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,632
What kind of injury
would do this, huh?

520
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,033
What would make us
look like this?

521
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,636
These are the marks of our
exalted people!, you fool!!

522
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,039
Her umbrella...

523
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,474
Hey, have you seen Kagura?!

524
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,642
You saw her, didn't you?

525
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,278
A cute girl with big round eyes
that look exactly like mine!

526
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:53,479
I'm not responsible!

527
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,346
I'm not responsible!

528
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,314
It's not my fault!

529
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,515
It's the Prince's fault!

530
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,617
It's because he keeps a collection
of dangerous monsters!

531
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,352
What, it's not my fault!

532
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:01,887
The customs people
should have checked

533
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,522
to make sure that
the alien was dead!

534
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,723
It's not my fault!

535
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,360
No Bossman!

536
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,428
That fool!

537
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,629
Does he want to get killed?!

538
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,499
Sadaharu, time for your walk...

539
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,836
Today, you're free to poop or play
wherever you want.

540
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:18,704
You can go wild all you like...

541
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,307
Now let's go!

542
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,742
What?

543
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:31,217
She's a girl with refined facial
features who looks just like me.

544
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,318
Have you seen her?

545
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,419
I have actually.

546
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,488
I while a girl I saw a cute little
girl who looks just like you!

547
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,557
Is she a princess of some planet?

548
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,125
She was a truly cute girl, honestly.

549
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,260
That's what I'm talking about!

550
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:45,231
Please, now I'm an old man
and I'm very impatient here.

551
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:46,932
Yeah, uh.
Over there.

552
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,400
But it's too...

553
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,236
She rescued us,
but the monster...

554
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,940
Oho, no.

555
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,509
Kaguraaaaaa!

556
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,471
<i>What do we do!</i>

557
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,106
<i>Gin has been eaten by the alien!</i>

558
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:37,376
<i>And Mr. Baldy is getting hurt</i>
<i>trying to protect injured Kagura.</i>

559
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,445
<i>Isn't that the</i>
<i>government's battleship?</i>

560
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,013
<i>Wait, If they use</i>
<i>all that firepower,</i>

561
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,048
<i>everyone in Edo City</i>
<i>will get killed...</i>

562
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:44,416
<i>The next episode...</i>
