1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,372
Is anybody home?

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,241
It's me, Katsura.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,211
I guess nobody's here,

4
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,946
and they had to be gone
when its urgent.

5
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,054
Ex... excuse me.

6
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,756
Is Gintoki at home right now?

7
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,027
Well then, I'll just leave
these sweets here with you.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,363
I hope you enjoy eating...

9
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:14,868
Well, it's not unlike her to disappear
for a couple of days,

10
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,037
but she's been missing
an entire week.

11
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,106
There's been no word from her,

12
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:22,409
and I've spoken to her friends,
but no one knows where she is.

13
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,013
Pull yourself together, Gintoki!

14
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,382
This is why I told you
not to drink too much.

15
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,685
Because I'm her father,
I am being humble,

16
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,487
but she's so beautiful
and attractive

17
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,222
that I'm worried she might
have gotten caught up

18
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,557
in something
unspeakably dreadful.

19
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,861
Yeah I'd say
there's a good chance

20
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,596
that she got caught up

21
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,798
in some sorta huge
ham processing machine

22
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:45,932
or something like that.

23
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,501
No, it's not like that.

24
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,568
I'm talking about
being caught up

25
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,570
in some sort
of criminal activity.

26
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:51,772
Criminal?

27
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,907
Oh, like unlicensed
ham processing?

28
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,876
Hey, you should stop
messing around.

29
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,812
Or are you trying to ruin
our chance to get this job?

30
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,983
<i>But, are you sure you want us</i>
<i>to handle this?</i>

31
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,484
Huh?

32
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,987
It sounds like something
better fit for the police.

33
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,656
I can't afford
a public scandal!

34
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,325
Our family is of an ancient
and honorable lineage

35
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,295
that has served the
Tokugawa Shogun family.

36
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,997
The entire clan will be
shamed if it gets out

37
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:20,000
that my precious darling daughter
is a club hopping skank.

38
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,403
Please, Odd Jobs, bring her back
home to me before word gets out.

39
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,947
Never seen anyone like her.

40
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,616
Someone told us that
she parties here all the time.

41
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,952
Maybe that's what someone
told you, young lady,

42
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,955
but you see, all Earthlings
look alike to me!

43
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:43,990
She got a name?

44
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,860
Um, it's... Ha... Hamilda!

45
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,128
Quit screwing around with me!

46
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,830
You obviously just made
that name up!

47
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,065
What kind of parent would give
their kid a name like that?

48
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,534
Why would I remember
her name?

49
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,404
Hey! Are you really
trying to find her?

50
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,907
Hey Gin, you know that
we'll never finish this job

51
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,909
if we leave it
all up to Kagura.

52
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,178
Man, whatever,
I don't care.

53
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,780
That ungrateful joke
of a daughter

54
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,015
is probably just camping out
at some dude's house.

55
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,383
This is so stupid.

56
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,986
Let's just give the father
some ham.

57
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:16,256
I honestly doubt that he'd ever
know the difference anyways.

58
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,024
There's no way he won't!

59
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,760
How long are you going to keep
milking that dumb ham joke!

60
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,365
Look, listen, I've got a "hamover"
and I feel like crap.

61
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,068
Just take care of it,
will ya, Shin? Thanks.

62
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,603
Hey, wait!
Gin, hey!

63
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,405
Oh, I'm sorry.

64
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:37,844
Young man, I suggest you learn
to pay a bit more attention.

65
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,283
Are you not embarrassed at all,

66
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,719
walking around with dust
on your shoulder?

67
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,222
You really oughta pay a bit more
attention to your appearance.

68
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,063
Now who the heck
was that guy?

69
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,298
Shinpachi!

70
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,302
I really can't be bothered, so I'm just
gonna bring this guy with us.

71
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,872
Oh my God, is anybody taking
this job seriously, damn it?

72
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:09,009
There's no way you can pass
this guy off as her!

73
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,277
That's not a "Hamilda."

74
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,678
Thats more like "Hamilton"!

75
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,749
Come on, ham are all the same,
you stupid piece of crap.

76
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,551
Is this your re‐deli‐ous phase?

77
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:20,887
Hamilton!

78
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,658
Hey, buddy, can you not waste
our screen time like this?

79
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,061
Hamilton, this is because
you drank so much.

80
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:31,565
This dude...

81
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,033
he's not drunk at all.

82
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,902
Hey, guys, guys,
don't bother with him.

83
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,070
I'll take it from here.

84
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,105
You two just go
enjoy yourselves.

85
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:39,940
Good grief.

86
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,474
The only thing anyone
ever thinks about

87
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,476
is smack, smack,
smack these days.

88
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,744
Smack, smack?

89
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,147
Did he get into a fight?

90
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,984
There's been a drug epidemic
going around in this place recently,

91
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:54,287
and it's real nasty stuff,
let me tell you.

92
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,356
Just say no, seriously.

93
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,727
<i>I swear I'm never</i>
<i>drinking again.</i>

94
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,464
Yeah, I know I always say that,
but this time, I mean it.

95
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,267
Who should I swear to?

96
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,736
I'll swear to that
hot weather forecaster.

97
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,872
Hey, I'm in here
taking a dump.

98
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,007
<i>Give me the usual.</i>

99
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,709
Huh?

100
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,210
<i>I said hurry up</i>
<i>and give me the stuff!</i>

101
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,813
<i>I'm telling you, I can't go on</i>
<i>without it anymore!</i>

102
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,082
Well...

103
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,417
You say that you want
the usual,

104
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,586
but it's a little more
watery than usual.

105
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,421
<i>Stop screwing around</i>
<i>with me, idiot!</i>

106
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,423
<i>Am I not welcome now</i>
<i>that I'm broke, is that it?</i>

107
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,958
<i>Fine, just be that way!</i>

108
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,793
<i>I'll just go and talk</i>
<i>to the cops.</i>

109
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,863
Hold on, wait a minute.

110
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,632
What the hell?
Talk to the cops?

111
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,000
Wait, hold on a second.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,901
You can if you want,
but about what?

113
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,602
What do you mean?

114
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,604
<i>Who the hell are you</i>
<i>talking to in there?</i>

115
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,708
<i>I told you to get the hell</i>
<i>out of my sight, bacon face!</i>

116
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,199
The hell do you want?

117
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,803
Gin sure is taking long.

118
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,539
I've got a really bad feeling
about this place, you know.

119
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,542
We should leave here
as soon as we can.

120
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,544
I'll go and find him now.

121
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,881
I take it you're the scumbags

122
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,883
who've been snooping
around this place.

123
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,152
Wh... what's this all about?

124
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,087
Don't you play dumb with us.

125
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,555
You've been poking your noses

126
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,991
where they don't belong,
haven't you?

127
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,227
If you're so interested
in our business,

128
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,295
we'll show you
how frightening

129
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,631
the Harusame Space
Pirates can be!

130
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,337
Give it to me, hurry!
Give it to me!

131
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,272
Oh, poor Hammy!

132
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,574
‐Sorry for thinking you were just basic.
‐Please, I need it.

133
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,043
‐All the men to get mixed up with...
‐Please.

134
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,946
...it looks like you got caught
up with the worst of them all.

135
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,516
<i>Daraku, it looks like we've got</i>
<i>a weird one here.</i>

136
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,684
<i>What should we do?</i>

137
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,786
<i>Hey, are you listening to me?</i>

138
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,488
Damn it!
I Can't get it off.

139
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,423
What are you going
to do about this?

140
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,459
I just got this jacket tailored.

141
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,626
This is disgusting!

142
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,862
It's all sticky
and it won't come off!

143
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,631
Hey, there, Daraku,
are you listening...?

144
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,767
I told you to shut
the front door

145
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,736
while I'm attending
to my appearance!

146
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,171
If you've got a problem
with someone,

147
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,507
just get rid
of the problem.

148
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,943
Lets cut the crap
and get out of here!

149
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,946
There's a rerun of a show that
I really want to watch tonight.

150
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,348
Yeah, me too.

151
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:40,553
I'm not really the violent
misanthrope that I seem to be,

152
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,723
but there are three things
that I simply can't abide.

153
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,727
First are people who interfere
with my work.

154
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,598
Second, people who don't wash
their hands after using the bathroom.

155
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:55,168
And third, scuzzy looking people
with ugly mop tops.

156
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,670
And you are...

157
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,172
three for three!

158
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,608
I admit I'm honored.

159
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,376
And while we're sharing,

160
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,279
how about I tell you the three kinds
of people that I can't stand?

161
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,984
First, girls who get hysterical
while preparing for school festivals!

162
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,252
Second!

163
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,522
Desperate guys who pretend
to be excited about festivals

164
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,956
to try to connect
with those girls!

165
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,358
And third!

166
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,029
Hypocrite teachers who noddingly
embrace these previous idiots!

167
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:30,136
So then in other words, you just
really hate school festivals.

168
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,772
You must have had
a depressing adolescence.

169
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,941
Better than yours,
I'm sure of it.

170
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,011
Aren't you a little too old
to be sneaking a J in the John?

171
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,750
Although it seems
like you guys

172
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,519
are now into dealing
some serious poison.

173
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,488
Since you Sky People arrived,

174
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,824
there've been a lot more
dangerous things in the world.

175
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,327
Well, I can't have you pushing drugs
on our innocent children.

176
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,029
Pushing drugs?

177
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,165
That little pig is the one
who came running to me.

178
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,767
I just got her
what she asked for,

179
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,969
and then she starts
making a scene?

180
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,604
She's the one
causing me trouble.

181
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:05,905
Is that right?

182
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,775
Well I'm sorry this silly little girl
caused you trouble.

183
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,777
I'll take her home and
give her a good lecturing!

184
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:16,616
Oh, come on.

185
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,718
Are you all here
to take a leak or what?

186
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,588
There aren't enough toilets.

187
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,823
Hey, don't make this difficult!

188
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,125
Shinpachi! Kagura!

189
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,293
Hey! What're they doing?

190
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,461
You bastards!

191
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,696
What did you do to them?

192
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,665
You totally disgust me.

193
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,459
I got dirty again.

194
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,427
This thing is now ruined.

195
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,463
I'll just have to buy
a new one.

196
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,853
Hang in there, man!

197
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,988
I won't let you die on me.

198
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,158
I'm going to get you through this,
I promise. You'll see.

199
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,594
You really should just
get rid of that.

200
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,330
<i>He ain't going</i>
<i>to make it, anyway.</i>

201
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,867
<i>You don't have what it takes</i>
<i>to rescue anyone, you know.</i>

202
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,136
<i>When have you ever managed</i>

203
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,805
<i>to protect anything</i>
<i>that matters to you?</i>

204
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:50,043
<i>All you do is lash out at</i>
<i>whatever's in front of you.</i>

205
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,680
<i>You slew them all,</i>
<i>and what did that leave you?</i>

206
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,815
<i>Nothing but a mountain</i>
<i>of corpses.</i>

207
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,984
<i>You're powerless.</i>

208
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,752
<i>Just get rid of it all.</i>

209
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,387
<i>Take the easy road.</i>

210
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,924
<i>There's nothing in this world</i>
<i>that you'll ever be able to protect!</i>

211
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,837
It's unlike you to be
having a nightmare.

212
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,040
Were you dreaming about
the past just now?

213
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,843
Cobra?
What in the hell are you doing?

214
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,880
I remember!

215
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,117
Better not to strain yourself.

216
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,052
You're incapable of using
your left arm,

217
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,455
and I'm told that you've also
broken several ribs.

218
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,957
Your friend is doing
even worse.

219
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,592
She looks okay
on the outside,

220
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,394
because you thankfully
broke her fall.

221
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,631
But her body is rotting
from the inside out.

222
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,300
It's lucky you found her
before it got any worse

223
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,369
but it's unclear whether
she'll recover.

224
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,671
Oh, what a stupid kid.

225
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,440
So tell me, what were you doing
in a place like that?

226
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,143
Never mind that, tell me how
did you manage to save me?

227
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,647
And before that, apologize
for last time, you bastard.

228
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,449
Speaking of which...
are you at all familiar with this?

229
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,885
‐No.
‐It's an illegal substance...

230
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:09,555
...called "Paradise" that has been
going around all over the city lately.

231
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,226
<i>It's made from a flower that</i>
<i>grows only on a remote planet,</i>

232
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,961
<i>and it's extremely addictive.</i>

233
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,731
Everyone who uses it, without exception,
meets a very tragic end.

234
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,837
Us exclusionists have been gathering
information on the matter recently

235
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:28,074
in an attempt to rid the city
of Edo of this growing evil.

236
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:31,010
<i>That's apparently where</i>
<i>you fell into all of this.</i>

237
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,247
Who knows what
would've happened to you

238
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,349
if my men
hadn't found you.

239
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,086
So tell me, what were you doing
in a place like that?

240
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,955
More importantly,
who were all those guys anyway?

241
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,024
The Harusame Space Pirates.

242
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:48,227
They're the largest organized
crime syndicate in the Milky Way.

243
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,364
<i>Their primary source of income</i>

244
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,567
<i>is their profits</i>
<i>from selling illicit drugs.</i>

245
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,103
<i>The very tips of their tentacles</i>
<i>have reached Earth,</i>

246
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,238
<i>and we can't rely</i>
<i>on the government police.</i>

247
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,808
They're totally corrupted
by the Amanto,

248
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,910
so we hoped we could do
something on our own.

249
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,213
But these space pirates were able
to corner even you, Gintoki.

250
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,316
They seem to be
a formidable adversary.

251
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,552
We may have
underestimated them.

252
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,754
We might need
to rethink our strategies.

253
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,856
Hey, man,
are you even listening?

254
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,159
They kidnapped my friends,

255
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,061
and I can't just afford
to leave them there.

256
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,597
You really think you can
beat them in your condition?

257
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:29,936
"A man's life is like traveling a long
road with a load on his shoulders."

258
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,941
This is our family motto that we've
cherished for centuries, Cobra.

259
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,743
That is total bullshit!

260
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,011
It's the motto
of the Shogun family!

261
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,248
The first time I heard that motto,
I remember thinking of myself,

262
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,816
what a lame thing to say.

263
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:44,951
But what do you know?

264
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,285
That old guy had a point.

265
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,521
It's not really
a burden after all.

266
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,791
<i>But everyone's got</i>
<i>both hands</i>

267
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,227
<i>full of something</i>
<i>that truly matters to them.</i>

268
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,530
<i>You just don't realize it</i>
<i>when you're carrying it.</i>

269
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,533
<i>It's only later you realize,</i>

270
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,535
<i>after it slips out of your hands.</i>

271
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:06,172
<i>How heavy it was to carry</i>
<i>in the first place...</i>

272
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,274
<i>so many times.</i>

273
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,010
<i>I thought I'd never carry</i>
<i>a load like that ever again.</i>

274
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,848
And yet, before I realized it
I was carrying it again.

275
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,651
I'd feel so much better
if I got rid of it.

276
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,487
But I just can't bring
myself to do it.

277
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,323
Without those guys around,
I just can't enjoy life as much.

278
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,693
There's no point in arguing.

279
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,596
I still owe you that favor
from the bomb incident.

280
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:31,864
Let's go.

281
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,065
Huh?

282
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,835
You can't carry any baggage
with just one hand, can you?

283
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,671
For the time being,
I'll have to be your left arm.

284
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,644
<i>Where is this place?</i>

285
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,679
<i>Where am I?</i>

286
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,648
<i>What am I doing right now?</i>

287
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:52,685
Are these the idiots who were caught
snooping around and asking questions?

288
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,920
That's right.

289
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,355
<i>They were becoming</i>
<i>a bit of a nuisance to us</i>

290
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,724
<i>so we set a trap</i>
<i>and they fell right into it.</i>

291
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,329
I believe these are the exclusionist
rebels that hate the Amanto.

292
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,297
Ribbit, ribbit.

293
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,099
There was one other
odd samurai with them,

294
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:11,337
but we got rid of him along with
an annoying loud mouthed customer.

295
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,973
I warned you not to attract
too much attention.

296
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,642
There's a limit to how much we can
keep the government officials

297
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,911
under control and
looking the other way.

298
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,580
Of course, I understand.

299
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,217
We are only able to do business
thanks to your magnanimity, my lord.

300
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:27,620
So, how are you going to dispose
of these two pests?

301
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,056
I'll get the location of
their headquarters out of them

302
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:30,756
and destroy it.

303
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,959
I don't want them interfering
any further with our work.

304
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,629
I presume their leader is that man
named Katsura, I've heard about.

305
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:40,066
They're bunch of mad dogs, even
baring their teeth at the government.

306
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,467
Don't take them lightly.

307
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,270
Daraku, a moment please.

308
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,607
I'm sorry, there are some
weirdos outside.

309
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,208
Some weirdos outside?

310
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,444
I'll leave it up to you
to handle it.

311
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,012
I'm very busy right now.

312
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,420
I'm telling you again,
we don't need any crap like you!

313
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,889
Aw come on.

314
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,957
Can't you guys
just take us with you?

315
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,026
I mean, we want
to become pirates, too.

316
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,694
Ain't that right, Cobra?

317
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,464
My name's Captain Katsura
not Cobra.

318
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,066
You know, ever since we were
little punk ass kids,

319
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,569
we've always dreamed
of becoming pirates like you.

320
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,739
We wanna go out and search
for the lost treasure "One Punk."

321
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,073
Isn't that right, Cobra?

322
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,175
My name's Captain Katsura
not Cobra.

323
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,543
Never heard of this treasure.

324
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,678
Go find it yourselves.

325
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,046
Come on, don't be like that.

326
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,714
After all, my hand is a hook,

327
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,550
which means I can only be
a pirate or a coat hanger.

328
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,718
Not my problem.

329
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,687
I'm sure you can be
whatever you want to be.

330
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:35,988
Just go home!

331
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,691
This isn't a place
for the likes of you.

332
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,510
At the very least
you could give us an interview.

333
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,712
We even brought
our resumes with us.

334
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,183
Hey, are you awake now, kid?

335
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,385
Yeah, sleepy time's over, kid!

336
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,120
Oh, look at you.

337
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,588
You're so young.

338
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,558
It's such a shame
you got captured by pirates!

339
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,260
Oh, yeah, that's right, pirates.

340
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,129
I've been actually
kidnapped by pirates.

341
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,634
Kagura!

342
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,203
You know, I hate filthy people

343
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:28,274
and I hate filthy people who try
to interfere with my business.

344
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,311
It's about time I exterminate
all you filthy rats.

345
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,413
Tell me where your nest is.

346
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,917
If you try to hold out,
then she dies.

347
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,418
What are you talking about?

348
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,486
Don't play dumb with me.

349
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,122
We know you're in league
with exclusionist rebels.

350
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,793
I said tell us where your base
of operations is!

351
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,929
Where is that scumbag Katsura?

352
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,265
What're you guys
talking about?

353
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,468
We're not exclusionist rebels

354
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,670
nor do we know
where Katsura is!

355
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,472
Let Kagura go, right now!

356
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,040
This is the land
of the samurai!

357
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,042
It's not your backyard!

358
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,045
The land of the Samurai,
you say?

359
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,280
There's no such thing
in this country anymore.

360
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,154
Kagura, no!

361
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,290
I don't want to get
in your way for this battle.

362
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,259
‐Bye‐bye.
‐Hold on!

363
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,896
Hold on!
Wait, wait, wait, wait...!

364
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:25,698
I've got you!

365
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,640
My wound just opened.

366
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,844
Is this where the interview
is being held?

367
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,381
Hi guys, I'm Gintoki SaKata,

368
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,250
and I'd like to try out
for captain, please.

369
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,119
My hobby is consuming sugar.

370
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,922
My special talent is being able
to sleep with my eyes open.

371
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,190
‐Gintoki!
‐Gintoki!

372
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,692
You bastard,
you were still alive?

373
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,694
What the...?

374
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,632
Daraku, there was an explosion
in the storeroom!

375
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,935
Our Paradise!

376
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,705
And now my work here
is done,

377
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,076
which means that it's now
your turn, Gintoki!

378
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,844
Go ahead and
trash the place.

379
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,679
I'll take care of anybody
who gets in the way!

380
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,614
You're that damn Katsura!

381
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:16,916
You're wrong!

382
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,151
My name is Captain Katsura!

383
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,689
Look, it's Katsura!

384
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:24,457
Let's get him!

385
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,358
Off with Katsura's head!

386
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,895
You guys are in for it.

387
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,699
You've made an enemy of
the entire Harusame gang!

388
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,235
Soon, Harusame scattered
across the universe

389
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,903
will come here to kill you.

390
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,573
And so what?

391
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,074
You won't be around
to see it.

392
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:43,809
Listen...

393
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,513
I don't care what you do
somewhere else in the universe,

394
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:51,650
but anywhere within the reach
of my sword, is my country!

395
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,686
Anyone who comes here...

396
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,654
and messes with my people,

397
00:20:55,654 --> 00:21:00,359
whether he's the Shogun, space pirates,
or an effin' meteorite,

398
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,495
I'll cut 'em all down!

399
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,463
Let's go!

400
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,844
Hey... you bastard...

401
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,313
you may not wash your hands
in the bathroom...

402
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,016
but your moves
are pretty clean.

403
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,132
Uh, I'm so beat,
everything's spinning.

404
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,567
I can't even walk.

405
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,470
Yeah, I'm feeling dizzy
from too much sun.

406
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:46,105
Carry me.

407
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,607
Why are you complaining,
you little brats?

408
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,809
Do you know who's
the most exhausted one here?

409
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,979
I fought my way over here
even though my body is a mess

410
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,347
and I have a hangover, too!

411
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,784
Both of us are feeling
pretty woozy too, you know!

412
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,120
That's right!
We're feeling woozy, boozy!

413
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,189
You know, I really
can't stand you guys.

414
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:04,990
I'm going home now.

415
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,634
Oh, come on,
knock it off already!

416
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,369
Okay, fine!
You want me to carry you?

417
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,704
I'll carry you!

418
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,175
What a miraculous recovery
they've made!

419
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:28,180
Gintoki, I feel like eating ramen.
I'm hungry.

420
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,216
Me too, but I'd be fine
with Sushi.

421
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,417
Don't be stupid!

422
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:34,353
Don't think we can go eat out
when its not your Birthday, man.

423
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,390
Oh, God, both of you guys
are heavy, dammit.

424
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,294
You better hold on,

425
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,797
and make sure you hold on
tightly this time.

426
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,042
Kimiko! Kimiko!

427
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,245
I'm so glad you're safe
and sound!

428
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,081
‐Kimiko!
‐Hey, old man.

429
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,682
You're hugging the wrong one!

430
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,317
Hey, I know how it is, pops.

431
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,886
There are some things in this world
you just don't want to see.

432
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,756
No, but isn't this happening
because he can see her?

433
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,251
<i>This is Gintoki.</i>

434
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:49,288
<i>The other day, I was chasing after</i>
<i>a stray cat that stole my fish,</i>

435
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:51,390
<i>but I was naked and</i>
<i>everyone under the sun,</i>

436
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,425
<i>even a little dog,</i>
<i>was laughing at me</i>

437
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,127
<i>Anyway, the next episode...</i>

438
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,328
<i>Three episodes including</i>

439
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,901
My name is Captain Katsura, not Cobra!
Believe it!

440
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,870
Did I get that right?
