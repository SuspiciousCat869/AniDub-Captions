1
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,386
<i>What's that?</i>

2
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:22,522
<i>You mean even Chat‐man and</i>
<i>Robby and the others were arrested?</i>

3
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,260
<i>Damn those Shinsengumi!</i>

4
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:27,494
<i>From what I've heard,</i>

5
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,097
even Katsura and Takasugi
left Edo City

6
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,698
in order to escape
their pursuit.

7
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,400
Such cowards, all of them.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,102
Have they forgotten
the Samurai spirit

9
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:36,503
that drives us
to save our country

10
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,238
without fearing any death?

11
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,174
Yes, but this may be
a good opportunity.

12
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:44,244
If we, The Three Scrooges
Brothers, act now,

13
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,346
we could surpass
Katsura and Takasugi,

14
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,282
and lead the Exclusionist Rebels.

15
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:50,417
They may be called
the special police,

16
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,887
but they're just a bunch of samurai
from the countryside.

17
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,355
If we take out their leader,

18
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,126
they'll be just a bunch of wandering
sheep without a shepherd.

19
00:00:59,126 --> 00:00:59,826
‐Right!
‐Right!

20
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,296
Our first target is the brain
of Shinsengumi,

21
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:05,299
the demon vice‐chief,
Toshiro Hijikata.

22
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,439
<i>‐Hey, Pops, give me the usual.</i>
‐Okay.

23
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,508
Oh, this is the first time
I've seen you

24
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,577
without your uniform, Mr. Hijikata.

25
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,278
Today is my day off.

26
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,883
It's hard to find things to do
when you're single.

27
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,285
Better than having a wife
nag at you all day long.

28
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,421
‐Is that so?
‐I heard that, honey!

29
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,291
<i>The demon vice‐chief</i>
<i>is totally off his guard.</i>

30
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,261
<i>It would be so easy</i>
<i>to get rid of him.</i>

31
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,196
<i>Shall we do it?</i>

32
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,667
Here you go,
the Hijikata special!

33
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,074
What the hell is he eating?

34
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:50,210
It makes me sick
just watching him eat.

35
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,747
Here you are,
the Gintoki Sweet Bowl!

36
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,518
What?! Is that sweet
red beans on rice?

37
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,721
What kind of diner is this?!

38
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,122
Are there only weirdos here?!

39
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,157
Hey, hey, brother, excuse me.

40
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,625
You with the mayonnaise
over there,

41
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,661
could you do everyone
a favor and leave?

42
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,096
Seeing you slurping
that in your mouth

43
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,931
is gonna ruin our appetite.

44
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,866
‐Right, buddy?
‐What, me?

45
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,136
If that's the case, then I think
it would be best if you left.

46
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,005
Anyone with taste buds
so messed up

47
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,541
that they put sweet red beans
on rice has no right to eat at a diner.

48
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,644
‐Right, buddy?
‐Well, I...

49
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,480
Don't you know that since
the ancient times, it has been said

50
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,782
that carbohydrate go great
with sweets?

51
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,517
Like donuts and cakes.

52
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,718
Right, buddy?

53
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,320
I have no idea.

54
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,356
Don't you know that
the most sophisticated way

55
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,860
<i>of enjoying the taste is</i>
<i>to have contradicting elements?</i>

56
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,728
<i>Adding salt or tartness</i>
<i>is the best way</i>

57
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,296
<i>to bring out</i>
<i>the original flavor.</i>

58
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,798
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>you need tons of mayo.</i>

59
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,200
‐Right, buddy?
‐No, and stop asking me.

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,102
I don't want to be part of this.

61
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:53,173
Don't compare my Gintoki Sweet Bowl
to your dog food.

62
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:57,177
This is a historic dish created
by General Sandwich,

63
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,782
who was too lazy to eat
rice and dessert separately.

64
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,517
‐Right, buddy?
‐Who is that?

65
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,886
And wouldn't General Sandwich
be inventing sandwiches?

66
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,587
‐What's with the rice?
‐Oh, yeah?

67
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,090
Well, mine was created
by General Barbarossa

68
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,391
who grew tired of eating rice

69
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,760
and mayonnaise separately
and created...

70
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,796
Who the hell are those Generals?!

71
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,798
And mayo isn't
some essential nutrient

72
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,533
you have to have
with every meal!

73
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,867
All right then,

74
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,969
let's compare them
to see which tastes better,

75
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,639
the Gintoki Sweet Bowl
or your dog food special.

76
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,841
‐Right, buddy?
‐What do you mean, "buddy"?

77
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,076
‐Hold it!
‐Well, bring it on.

78
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,078
‐Right, buddy?
‐Wait, hold on, it's not right!

79
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:31,778
What is this?!

80
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,481
Why should I have to eat it?
Oh, no!

81
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,183
We need an objective opinion.

82
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:39,119
That's why it has to be done
by a complete stranger, right, dummy?

83
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,287
Yeah, we're counting on you.
Right, dummy?

84
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,788
You just called me dummy!

85
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,657
Is that a way to ask a favor?

86
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,326
<i>How is it, dummy?</i>

87
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,828
<i>Isn't mine a lot tastier?</i>

88
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:48,795
<i>Right dummy?</i>

89
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,564
<i>Hey, dummy!</i>

90
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,533
Thank you very much.

91
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,370
Damn it, we didn't anticipate
such interference.

92
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,140
Big Brother, who was
that silver‐haired guy?

93
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,208
No idea.

94
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,509
Never mind, Jiro.

95
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,944
It's your turn now.

96
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,178
Don't blow it.

97
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,948
<i>How annoying!</i>

98
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:11,518
<i>Why did I have to run into that jerk</i>
<i>of all people on my day off?</i>

99
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,087
I was thinking
of catching a movie,

100
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,022
but it's for children.

101
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,125
I don't feel like watching it.

102
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,461
<i>Oh, Pedro, help me!</i>

103
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,664
<i>My younger sister,</i>
<i>Oshizu, is lost,</i>

104
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,900
<i>and she must be crying</i>
<i>by herself somewhere.</i>

105
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,668
<i>Please help me, Pedro!</i>

106
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,771
<i>Why don't you try</i>
<i>calling the cops?</i>

107
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,673
<i>Please help, Pedro!</i>

108
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,609
<i>Listen, they cut my phone off.</i>

109
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,377
<i>Please help, Pedro!</i>

110
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,580
<i>You're just like all the rest.</i>

111
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,651
<i>You only come asking, " Pedro, Pedro"</i>
<i>whenever you need help.</i>

112
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,853
<i>The other day,</i>
<i>you rang my doorbell...</i>

113
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,522
It's really getting to me.

114
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:51,024
This kid movie captures
the heart of adults, too.

115
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,193
It's a movie all adults should see.

116
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,129
<i>Just what scene</i>
<i>is he crying over?</i>

117
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,532
<i>But this darkness</i>
<i>will make my job easier.</i>

118
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:01,802
<i>Just one blow</i>
<i>right from behind.</i>

119
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,370
Hey, you over there!

120
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,572
Your sobbing is way too loud.

121
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,940
I couldn't hear a thing.

122
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,375
What did Pedro just say?

123
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,910
What about ringing his doorbell?

124
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,547
I'm sorry. The girl rang
Pedro's doorbell and...

125
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,248
You again!

126
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,349
What's with you, man?

127
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,119
Why are you showing up
everywhere I go?

128
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,654
You just stole my line, stupid!

129
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,589
What? Are you that desperate
to make a friend?

130
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,890
You wanna be friends?

131
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,891
You idiot!

132
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,960
I was wondering who the hell
was the annoying guy

133
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,728
munching on popcorn behind me!

134
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,796
Get out!

135
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,931
‐Get out now!
‐Shut up!

136
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,399
I was just trying to get
the popcorn kernel

137
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,167
that got stuck behind my teeth!

138
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,303
Now you've made me
lose track of the whole story!

139
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:39,339
I don't know what the hell
is going on anymore!

140
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,142
The popcorn is the only thing
I've got now!

141
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,379
That's what happens when a
samurai eats such frivolous foods.

142
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,048
Are you an idiot or something?

143
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,349
You popcorn head!

144
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,952
I think your brain
just popped out, didn't it?!

145
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,654
I don't want to hear that
from a mayo samurai!

146
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,523
How do you set that
slicked‐down hair of yours?!

147
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,426
With a glob of mayonnaise
or something, huh?

148
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,361
Why don't you step outside!

149
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,330
What offering do you want me
to put on your grave?

150
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,698
Sweet beans? Popcorns?

151
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,765
What do you say?!

152
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,135
‐That hurts!
‐Hey! Keep it down, you guys!

153
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,704
If you're gonna fight,
take it outside.

154
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,738
You're bothering people!

155
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,273
Yeah, I can't see!

156
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,509
What's the matter
with you, losers?

157
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,979
Watching this crappy movie
in middle of the day.

158
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,347
"Go to work, lazy bums!"

159
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,349
Says the guy
with the braided hat.

160
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,717
"I'm so pissed off.

161
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,718
Come up here and fight!"

162
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,286
Says the guy
with the braided hat.

163
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,887
Wait, no!
Why would I...

164
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,422
All right!
You wanna fight?

165
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,657
Let's get him!

166
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:31,858
<i>Go him!</i>

167
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,293
What?!

168
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,229
Just a minute!

169
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,364
<i>Now's my chance.</i>

170
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,566
If I can use this racket
to finish him off.

171
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,008
Hey, everyone!

172
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,711
Let's be quiet
when watching the movie.

173
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,916
This movie makes me cry.

174
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,968
Damn that Hijikata
and that silver‐haired guy.

175
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,103
I'll get them for sure next time.

176
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,039
<i>I will avenge my brothers.</i>

177
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,442
<i>Why do I have to be</i>
<i>so exhausted on my day off?</i>

178
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,978
<i>Everywhere I go,</i>
<i>I run into that jerk.</i>

179
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:29,616
<i>I hate to admit it, but it seems</i>
<i>the two of us think alike.</i>

180
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:38,792
<i>Hey, I feel like taking a hot bath</i>
<i>and a nap in a massage chair,</i>

181
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,293
<i>but I won't be tricked.</i>

182
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,695
<i>The fact that I'm thinking this now</i>

183
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,264
<i>means he's probably thinking</i>
<i>the exact same thing.</i>

184
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,665
<i>So should I just do the opposite</i>

185
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,367
<i>and go where he</i>
<i>doesn't want to go?</i>

186
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,002
<i>But he's probably</i>
<i>thinking that too,</i>

187
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,905
<i>so today, I used reverse psychology</i>

188
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,773
<i>and headed straight</i>
<i>for the Spa Land.</i>

189
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,608
<i>He must be thinking, "Wait!</i>

190
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,711
<i>Is this a diary</i>
<i>or something?"</i>

191
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,580
So I'll do the opposite
of the opposite!

192
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,552
Hii‐jii‐ka‐taaaaaa!

193
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,487
Cut it out already.

194
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,056
I thought you'd show up again

195
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,391
at the place
where I wanted to go,

196
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,526
so I thought of going
where I didn't want to go,

197
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,295
but then I didn't like
the idea of going

198
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,097
where I don't want
to go because of you,

199
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,366
so I'll be true to myself today
and then, I thought, "Wait!

200
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,967
Is this a diary or something?"

201
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,602
So I ended up here.

202
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:26,005
Dammit. Only the "Wait,
is this a diary?" part matched.

203
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,475
I was a fool to try to read
your mind too deeply!

204
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,809
Well, never mind.

205
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,512
It must be some kind of fate
that we keep meeting like this.

206
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,880
So get outta here.

207
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,916
Why on earth do I have
to take orders from you?

208
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,952
If someone's leaving,
it should be you.

209
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,654
Hey, hey, are you
in elementary school?

210
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,923
If we keep meeting like this,
we'll get into a fight,

211
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,493
so it'd be best if we don't
see each other at all.

212
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,495
It's my very mature opinion.

213
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,830
So you should be
the one to leave.

214
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,032
Hey now, don't you say that!

215
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,501
I was actually
thinking of leaving,

216
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,169
but if I leave
after you tell me to,

217
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,937
then it's as though I'm
following your orders!

218
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,005
Now I can't leave!

219
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,440
Consider my feelings.

220
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,175
Shut up!
You're the brat!

221
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,243
Let me make this clear.

222
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,878
I'm not leaving until you do.

223
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,578
Who are you kidding?!

224
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,946
I'm not leaving either.

225
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,016
<i>Their stupidity is so alike.</i>

226
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,652
<i>‐Never mind. Just get out.</i>
<i>‐</i> You can both keep on arguing in there.

227
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,289
<i>I'll wrap a chain</i>
<i>and put on a sign here.</i>

228
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,324
<i>And you two</i>
<i>can just shrivel up!</i>

229
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,528
Hey, enough already.

230
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,797
You're drenched with sweat.

231
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,932
You'll collapse from dehydration.

232
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,400
I'm doing just fine, though.

233
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,902
You think you're so tough, huh?

234
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,937
I can see your smile twitching.

235
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,239
I can see it in your eyes,
you're screaming for water.

236
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,574
Though I'm doing just fine.

237
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,444
Hey, I'm much more okay
than you are, huh?

238
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,947
No way, my okay is much more
thorough than your okay.

239
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,751
That's what you say, but I know
you're actually suffocating.

240
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,786
I can see right
through you, man.

241
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,055
Don't be ridiculous.

242
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,624
I love saunas,
I love to steam.

243
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,927
In fact, the other day,
I got a little carried away

244
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,663
and steamed buns for
Shinpachi and Kagura.

245
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,732
Shall I raise
the temperature in here?

246
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,868
I like it hotter, you see.

247
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,204
<i>What?!</i>

248
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,207
<i>He raised the temperature</i>
<i>even higher!</i>

249
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,441
Not enough steam!

250
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,643
Pour the entire bucket in.

251
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,712
<i>Are you guys stupid or something?</i>

252
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,347
<i>You're sealed in there, you know!</i>

253
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,381
<i>You can't get out!</i>

254
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,518
It's such a Paradise!

255
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,986
I can feel my adrenaline surge!

256
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,056
Now, you're ready
to take off to Paradise.

257
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,959
Don't be so hard on yourself.

258
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,894
It's about time you're gonna
lose your conscience.

259
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,262
Give it up, you.

260
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,297
Just so you know,
I'm not giving up.

261
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,365
‐Never!
<i>‐Hey!</i>

262
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,566
<i>Who do you think</i>
<i>you're talking to?!</i>

263
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,068
<i>Who the hell</i>
<i>are you talking to?!</i>

264
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,304
Looks like you've reached
your limit.

265
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,040
‐This cigarette has no flavor at all.
<i>‐Wait wait!</i>

266
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,876
<i>That's not a cigarette!</i>
<i>That's not a cigarette!</i>

267
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,645
Seriously, man, you should
just give up already.

268
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,647
What? What is it with you?

269
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,249
You plan on dying in here?

270
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,384
Because of your stupid stubbornness?

271
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,520
Oh, even a guy like you
would have people

272
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,188
who would mourn your death!

273
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,857
If you still won't give up,
it's just your ego!

274
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,626
You're an idiot, you know!

275
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,494
For your own sake,
give it up!

276
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,230
Please.
I'll give you three bucks.

277
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,699
Who would give up
for just three bucks?

278
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,134
<i>They are such fools.</i>

279
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,369
<i>So why... why am I...?</i>

280
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,205
<i>Why am I so moved</i>
<i>by these fools?</i>

281
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:16,109
<i>We samurai of the Exclusionist Rebels</i>
<i>risk our lives for our country.</i>

282
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:20,013
<i>These men who can put their lives</i>
<i>on the line for something this stupid.</i>

283
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,048
<i>Maybe we aren't so different.</i>

284
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,150
Hey.

285
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,688
Man, you really are
a piece of work.

286
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,691
I have to say...
I give up.

287
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,294
Looks like you win this match.

288
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:37,530
Hey!

289
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,170
S‐Sorry, but could you take
a message to Odd Jobs?

290
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,239
Tell them bye‐bye.

291
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,176
You bastard.

292
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,312
I don't like taking messages.

293
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,447
Go tell them yourself.

294
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,883
<i>I can't do it.</i>

295
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,252
<i>I can't kill such courageous men.</i>

296
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,321
<i>I just can't.</i>

297
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,990
Hey, come out of there,
you morons!

298
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,826
‐What?
‐I was just kidding, sucker!

299
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:07,760
What?!

300
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,431
I told you I can read
you like a book!

301
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,837
Oh, damn, let's call it even.

302
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,540
No way, you totally got
out first, it's not even!

303
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,109
No, you got out first, moron!

304
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,479
Wait. Who is this guy?

305
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,464
I found you, Kagura!

306
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:50,903
Yo!

307
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,741
‐Get a hold of yourself, Yo!
‐Hey, you dummy!

308
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:58,645
The rule is no kicking if one of us
is within one meter of the can!

309
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,414
I have never heard
of such a wimpy rule.

310
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,482
Oh, forget it!

311
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,984
She doesn't know
how to hold back at all!

312
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,119
I'm sick of this too.

313
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,987
You take this way
to seriously, dummy!

314
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,123
We won't play games
with you anymore.

315
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,624
Idiot!
Moron!

316
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,760
‐Let's go.
‐What a bunch of wimps.

317
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,596
Giving everything you've got
is what makes a game fun.

318
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,865
Very well said.

319
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,500
That's exactly right.

320
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,834
Because when you give your best,

321
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,737
your performance level
will go above your abilities.

322
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,340
If you try as hard as you can
at everything you do,

323
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,175
even boring things will be fun.

324
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,011
Everything in the world
is just one big game.

325
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,846
Little girl, how about it?

326
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,682
Want to play
"kick the can" with me?

327
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:39,585
Well Gin always says I shouldn't
play with guys I don't know.

328
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,621
But it's okay if it's
an old guy you don't know?

329
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,390
No, because all men
are beasts.

330
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,926
You're young,
but very street smart.

331
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,162
I like you even more.

332
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,731
Then how about we ask
your folks to join us, eh?

333
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,100
Don't treat me like a kid,
you old fart!

334
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,202
Hey, isn't that Kagura over there?

335
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,738
Yeah, there she is.
Hey!

336
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,575
I was so shocked.

337
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,545
He seemed so healthy
just a while ago.

338
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:08,247
He suddenly collapsed
two nights ago.

339
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:12,085
We were surprised, but I think
that he was even more surprised by it.

340
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,386
So true.

341
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:17,356
None of us know what tomorrow
will bring, that's for sure.

342
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,326
Please don't let this
depress you too much, Zen.

343
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,260
Yes.

344
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,462
Thank you very much.

345
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,531
Man, this is such a drag.

346
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,668
Why do I have go through all
these suffocating formalities

347
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,236
for my crappy old man?

348
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,539
‐Kick the can?
‐Yeah.

349
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,808
The old fart wants us
all to play together.

350
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:36,743
Let's do it.

351
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,377
What are you saying?

352
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,613
I told you over and over
until my tongue shriveled up

353
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,148
to not talk or play with strangers.

354
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,016
You're a fool.
Do you want to get kidnapped?

355
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,986
I'm not a stranger,
I'm just a strange old man!

356
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:47,920
Be quiet.

357
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,655
Men are all beasts, let's go.

358
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,291
Better an old woman you know
than an old man you don't know.

359
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,993
She's treating us
to barbecue,

360
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,262
and that doesn't happen
too often.

361
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,132
In times like this,
old ladies are far better.

362
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,566
Old ladies are awesome!

363
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,935
Heart‐Warming, almighty.

364
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,004
Granny, in short...
she is a...

365
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,140
That spells "HAG", you idiot!

366
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,174
Hey!

367
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,277
I'll be the it,
so let's just play!

368
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,712
Just kick the can!

369
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:13,846
I told you we're not playing...

370
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,281
‐...you old fart!
‐Hey, leave him alone!

371
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,417
Do you want me to kick it?

372
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,186
I'll kick it for ya!

373
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,924
Bring that back
within twenty seconds,

374
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,126
and we'll play with you,
you old fart.

375
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,861
You're evil, pure evil!

376
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,931
Catherine, you shouldn't
bully the elderly!

377
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,366
Shut up, I've got to eat.

378
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,434
I'm having a craving
for protein.

379
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,437
Come on, let's go before
the old hag changes her mind!

380
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,873
Catherine, get lost
and watch the shop.

381
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,542
If you can't be nice
to the elderly,

382
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,278
then don't expect the elderly
to be nice to you.

383
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,412
What are you saying?

384
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,314
You're not an elderly,
Miss Otose.

385
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,550
You're still so young
and energetic!

386
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,252
Okay, I got the can!

387
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,921
Let's start the game!

388
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,593
It's a pity we lost
such a great man.

389
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,829
Even the most formidable warrior
of the Spy Agent

390
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,163
could not defeat old age.

391
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,298
What are you talking about?

392
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,333
He was nothing more than a
good‐for‐nothing old pervert

393
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,968
who was playing around
all year long.

394
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,270
You don't know how much
trouble he caused me.

395
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,539
No, no, no mere pervert

396
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,542
could be a great master
of the ninja school.

397
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,078
All of the renowned ninja
in Edo City these days

398
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,581
were brought up and
trained by your father.

399
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,251
You may call him
a good‐for‐nothing,

400
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,287
but I loved that
mischievous side of him.

401
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,122
Master!

402
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,727
I got here as fast as I could

403
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,896
when I heard
he was in critical condition.

404
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,265
Dad has already died.

405
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,701
‐The critical state was two nights ago.
‐What?

406
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,703
That can't be!
Master!

407
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,438
Damn the critical condition!!

408
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,406
Hey, the guy being bent
in half under your feet

409
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,108
seems to be
in critical condition too.

410
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,343
He's in a V‐shape.

411
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,714
Just get it over with already!

412
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,384
I just love this tension.

413
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,454
I feel like I'm a little kid again.

414
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,256
Are you ready, boys and girls?!

415
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:06,158
Here comes the old man!

416
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,326
Where are you headed?

417
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,461
To the afterlife?

418
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,630
Man, why do we have
to play kick the can

419
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,265
with an old geezer
we don't even know?

420
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,267
All I wanted was
to eat barbecue.

421
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,468
I'm starving for meat.

422
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,836
I'm sorry for the old man,

423
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,504
but I'll just let myself
get caught

424
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,406
so we can end
this game quickly.

425
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,807
How dare you say
such a thing?!

426
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,876
You're choosing to lose
without even trying?

427
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,611
You call yourself a soldier?

428
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,848
We call whimpy people
like you losers!

429
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,884
Sergeant, refer this loser
to the court‐martial?

430
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,186
Stop your yapping,
Private Chihuahua.

431
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,455
If we have to play,
then we're not gonna lose.

432
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:40,059
Barbecue tastes way better after
a win than a defeat, Sergeant.

433
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,395
You said it right,
Private Chihuahua.

434
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,031
Kick the can
is just a kid's game.

435
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,401
You win if you topple that can
before you're spotted by "It".

436
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,504
You need a strategy to knock it over
without being detected.

437
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,105
With that in mind,
get ready to fire.

438
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,106
Aye, aye, sir!

439
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,208
Is that what you call
kick the can, Sergeant?

440
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,411
It's kick the can
in its purest form.

441
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,314
Remember your childhood days.

442
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,582
<i>How you cried when</i>
<i>the wind toppled the can over</i>

443
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,384
<i>and all the captives were freed.</i>

444
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,553
It's basically the same thing.

445
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,423
No way, man! You can't throw,
that's cheating!

446
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,558
You're way too soft, loser!

447
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,360
The whole joy of kick the can

448
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,596
is to knock the can over
in the dirtiest way possible

449
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,801
and enjoy in a devilish way
watching "It" cry in despair!

450
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,903
<i>It's all over if you</i>
<i>end up as "It"!</i>

451
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,472
<i>I don't know how many times</i>
<i>the can got knocked over,</i>

452
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,606
<i>and how many times I cried</i>

453
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,344
<i>as I pretended to count to 100</i>
<i>while everyone else hid from me.</i>

454
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,814
It's a game
of triumph and tears.

455
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:37,049
That's kick the can!

456
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,872
That's kick the can!

457
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,482
Hey, guys!

458
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,684
This isn't kick the can,
it's murder!

459
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,586
It's pure murder, you guys!

460
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:14,553
Private Chihuahua!

461
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,389
Who ordered you
to hit the old man?

462
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,924
Sergeant!
With all due respect sir,

463
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,559
but that grenade
was thrown by you!

464
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,294
This is a matter
for the court‐martial!

465
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,496
We'll all be sued!

466
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,231
You've literally killed him!!

467
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,599
Wait a minute!

468
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,134
Up we go now.

469
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,902
He got up
like nothing happened!

470
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,070
Damn it!

471
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,005
Why don't you die, old man?!

472
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,874
You're not playing
kick the can anymore!

473
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,178
He's guarding the can
with his cane!

474
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,180
‐Damn it!
‐How is he moving like that?

475
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,682
I found you.

476
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,783
There you are.

477
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,384
‐Yikes!
‐Ninja knives!

478
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,287
What? Who is he?

479
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:50,990
What? Kick the can?

480
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,692
Oh, have you forgotten, Sacchan?

481
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,061
We played it a lot
in Master's class.

482
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,663
Kick the can demanded
the ability to hide yourself

483
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,765
and make instantaneous decisions.

484
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,934
It's similar to our spy work.

485
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,702
So as part of our ninja training,

486
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,872
we played kick the can
quite a bit, remember?

487
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,041
Oh, yes, we did.
That's right.

488
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,176
Now that you mention it.

489
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,777
It was really fun.

490
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,481
If you can't remember,
don't pretend like you do, okay?

491
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,883
And why did you come to the funeral
dressed like that?

492
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,353
I thought tonight was the crucial night
so I dressed up for the occasion.

493
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,655
I thought we could all
go for a drive

494
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,091
after Master got through
the critical condition.

495
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,526
That outfit was for critical condition?

496
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,596
Anyway, I can't forget
the smile on Master's face

497
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,265
whenever he played
kick the can.

498
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,335
I think he had more fun
playing than we did.

499
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,471
He really was like a big kid.

500
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,740
I'm sure that's why
all the kids loved him.

501
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,778
You guys compliment him
far too much.

502
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,618
You're wasting your time!

503
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,753
Did you think you could
beat me with your legs?

504
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,555
Found you, four‐eyes!

505
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,024
You fell for my trap.

506
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,961
A classic error
in kick the can...

507
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,996
over pursuing one target!

508
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,000
‐Dang!
‐That can is wide open!

509
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:10,970
I scraped my head!

510
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,571
My head's been grated!!

511
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,973
You fools!

512
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,407
Found you too, Silver Hair!

513
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,210
‐Shinpachi!
‐Here! I got it!

514
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,048
Goooo!

515
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,517
I'm gonna get the can!

516
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,418
Over my dead body!

517
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,290
Found you, four‐eyes
and silver hair.

518
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,792
I stepped on the can.

519
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:38,330
My father loved
playing kick the can.

520
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,799
When I was little we often
played it together,

521
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,603
and I always thought
"what a great father he was."

522
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,173
I was also worried
it might interfere with his job,

523
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,674
because he played
with me so much.

524
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,477
I was very much grateful
when I was a kid.

525
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:55,548
But even after I became an adult,
he still asked me to play.

526
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,583
So I realized "Wait a minute!

527
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,818
I thought he was playing
for my sake,

528
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,221
but he was playing
for his own sake."

529
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,856
Really, it's like he went straight

530
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,991
from being a kid
to being an old man.

531
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,860
He was always having fun,

532
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,197
<i>which used to annoy me</i>
<i>when I was a teenager,</i>

533
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,832
<i>but I also envied him</i>
<i>on the other hand.</i>

534
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,468
Kagura, I found you!

535
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:22,508
<i>It's rather easy for kids</i>
<i>to become adults,</i>

536
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,912
<i>but it's not so easy for adults</i>
<i>to keep the spirit of a kid,</i>

537
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,515
<i>where you can enjoy everything.</i>

538
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,518
And for that,
yes, I admire him.

539
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,323
There is just one thing, however,
that I can never forgive.

540
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:40,426
That bastard sold all my comics
to a used book store

541
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:43,162
and bought a shit‐load
of porno DVDs!

542
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:45,231
That makes me so angry!

543
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:49,368
Oh, forgive me for losing it.

544
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,671
But it still makes me angry,
and brings tears.

545
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,640
I've said many things,

546
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,109
but in summary,
he was a crappy father.

547
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,511
That's how he always was,

548
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:03,148
so don't be surprised if
he comes to visit you as a ghost.

549
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:06,785
<i>If he does, please play</i>
<i>kick the can with him.</i>

550
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:15,894
What is it?

551
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:19,265
Well, I thought I just
saw him smile a little bit.

552
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,300
What are you talking about?

553
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,669
He's always had
a smiley face.

554
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,305
It always annoyed me.

555
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,131
