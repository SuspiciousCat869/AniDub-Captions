<i>The land of the samurai.</i>

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,272
<i>There was a time,</i>
<i>a long time ago</i>

3
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:07,307
<i>when our country</i>
<i>was called by that name.</i>

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,677
<i>With the arrival of</i>
<i>the "Amanto" or Sky People</i>

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,946
<i>and the Sword Ban</i>
<i>enacted 20 years ago,</i>

6
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,115
<i>the samurai class</i>
<i>fell into decline.</i>

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:21,655
<i>In these hard times there was one man</i>
<i>left with the spirit of the samurai.</i>

8
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,024
<i>His name is Gintoki Sakata,</i>

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,193
<i>a reckless jack of all trades</i>

10
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,262
<i>with a serious sweet tooth</i>
<i>and a big heart.</i>

11
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:29,730
<i>Due to some rather</i>
<i>unexpected events,</i>

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,666
<i>I, Shinpachi Shimura</i>
<i>and Kagura work here now.</i>

13
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,202
<i>The three of us working together</i>

14
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,970
<i>fight the corruption on the planet!</i>

15
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,740
<i>Is this that kind of anime?</i>

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
♪Your Father is Bleep Bleep♪

<i>Hey, hey, haven't you had</i>
<i>enough already?</i>

21
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,391
I've told you a hundred million times
that we had nothing to do with it!

22
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:40,127
There are some things
in the world that never change.

23
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,629
The culprit is always the one
to claim they're innocent

24
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,197
and being falsely accused.

25
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,932
How stubborn are you going to be?

26
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,702
I've explained everything from
the beginning to the very end.

27
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,338
Yeah, yeah, like I haven't heard
that one before,

28
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,839
because people are always like,

29
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,342
"My kid would never!"
or "I don't remember!"

30
00:02:55,675 --> 00:03:00,000
You're just as hard to believe as the
people who say things like that.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,300
Come on, and just confess already.

32
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,600
We're not running a charity here.

33
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,150
Or what do you guys think?

34
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,000
Do you think you'll get off the hook
if you keep holding out,

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,620
because that ain't gonna happen.

36
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,695
I've had enough of this,
you balding idiot!

37
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,065
We've already told you
that we're innocent,

38
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,500
so quit wasting your breath

39
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,068
and open the damn door
right now!

40
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,303
We have places to go
and things to do!

41
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,340
Violence has four eyes.

42
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,443
Hey, you're out of character, bro.

43
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,012
What?

44
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,347
I risk my life getting rid
of that bomb for them

45
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,516
and they rake us over the coals
for three entire days,

46
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,784
those rotten cops!

47
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,453
Hey, at least we got out.

48
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,988
And thanks to me, we're not
their prime suspects anymore.

49
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,391
That's true, but why
they released us after Shinpachi,

50
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,826
of all people, freaked out?

51
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:49,129
Because they know someone who's
normally docile is more of a pain in the butt

52
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,464
to deal with when they snap.

53
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,032
These cops piss me off.

54
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,867
So I think I'm going
to piss on them.

55
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,002
All right, I'm going
to go puke on them.

56
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,170
Stop that!

57
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,473
We're on a show!
Control yourselves!

58
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,075
There'll be no end to the number
of times I'm going to be arrested

59
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,477
if I hang around
with you guys.

60
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:04,978
That's it,
I'm going home.

61
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,215
Don't get lost on the way home,
you morons!

62
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:11,551
Hey, hey, we can't have a comedy
anime without a straight man.

63
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,353
I suppose I don't have a choice.

64
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,388
I'll be the straight man
in this episode.

65
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,891
You... watch where you're puking!

66
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:19,793
Gross!

67
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,000
What's that gross smell?

68
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,503
Hey, just a second!
Stop that man!

69
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,304
He's an escaping convict!

70
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,340
Huh?

71
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,207
Damn!

72
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,610
Stay back!

73
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,778
Take one step closer
and barf babe gets it!

74
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,913
Oh, you scum!

75
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,848
Just for one day.

76
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,284
Hey, you there
with the mop top.

77
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,119
Do you know
how to drive a car?

78
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:46,987
Yeah.

79
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:52,926
Hey, don't think you can get away
with defying the authorities!

80
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,594
He's got me
and I'm scared.

81
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,862
I'm so scared!

82
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,665
I guess I have no choice
but to do as he says.

83
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,401
Come on, get out of my way!

84
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,916
After him!
Do not let him get away!

85
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,024
Well, it sure felt good
to defy those officers,

86
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:27,027
but do you honestly think that you
can get away with this or what?

87
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,296
Just turn right
and keep driving.

88
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:32,065
These days, successfully escaping
from prison is tougher

89
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,634
than getting six matching
numbers in the lottery.

90
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,506
I have no desire
to escape for good.

91
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,474
This is just for one day.

92
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,344
I'll be happy enough
if I can be free for just one day.

93
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,720
Today is a special day.
Today.

94
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,389
Today is a special day, huh?

95
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,326
I mean, if you're captured immediately
after breaking out of prison,

96
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,295
it'll definitely be a special day
that you'll never be able to forget.

97
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,299
Step on it, will you?!

98
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,134
I can't afford
to get caught right now!

99
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,002
Move it!

100
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,870
As you wish, old man.

101
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,372
Let's go!

102
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,080
<i>Look over here.</i>

103
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:27,988
We've just opened a new maid themed
teahouse you should check out.

104
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,189
That's so cute.

105
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,361
Move, move!
Get out of my way!

106
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,764
<i>Pull over, you scumbag!</i>

107
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,399
<i>You can't get away from us!</i>

108
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,967
Can't get away from you,
you say?

109
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,070
When you say that, it only makes me
want to prove you idiots wrong!

110
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,643
<i>The suspect is headed southbound</i>
<i>toward the Sky Terminal Tower.</i>

111
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,379
<i>Requesting</i> <i>an</i> <i>immediate</i> <i>barricade</i>
<i>at</i> <i>the</i> <i>intersection.</i>

112
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,179
<i>Ten four.</i>

113
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,450
What?

114
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,987
The road, it's...
We're not done yet!

115
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,665
Here...

116
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,400
goes...

117
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,704
Go!

118
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,645
We did it!

119
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,695
And here we...

120
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,293
We actually did it!

121
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,733
What? A stroller?

122
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,478
‐Pa!
‐Listen, my son and I already walked...

123
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:32,779
...a path of demons.

124
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,682
We are in a hurry, so please
allow us our leave.

125
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,251
That damned wolf and cub.

126
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,287
Doesn't he know that cars
can't simply stop so quickly?

127
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,890
<i>I see them!</i>
<i>There they are!</i>

128
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,360
Oh, damn it!

129
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,762
Hey, old man.

130
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,296
This way.

131
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,933
Damn it.
Where did they go?

132
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,101
Find them!

133
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,836
They couldn't have gone that far.

134
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,010
Hey, Kagura!

135
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,311
Come on, wake up already!

136
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,614
It stinks!

137
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,383
So tell me,
why are you helping me?

138
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,485
I'm not sure.

139
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,187
It doesn't make any sense.

140
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,823
Now you're all wrapped up
in this mess and yet...

141
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,158
Well, that's true.

142
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,660
But part of it is for
selfish reasons of my own.

143
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,196
I hate the police, and maybe...

144
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,397
Huh?

145
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,833
I just want to see you
through your special day.

146
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,705
Well, we're almost there,
let's hurry!

147
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,240
Right!

148
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,476
<i>Hey, everybody!</i>

149
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,847
<i>Thank you all for coming</i>

00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,225
Some fungus!

155
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,660
<i>Okay then, you guys.</i>

156
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,962

♪Even though everybody seems to be...♪

160
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,179
What the hell is this?

161
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,314
It's the first live performance

162
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,550
by today's up and coming
pop idol, Otsu Terakado.

163
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:18,885
You idiot!

164
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,387
Is life just some kind
of game to you?

165
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,823
You broke out of prison
for a pop idol?

166
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,627
You'd ruin your entire life just for
a moment's pleasure at a concert?

167
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,797
That's the kind of the mentality that
got you thrown in jail in the first place.

168
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,735
It's precisely because I ruined
my entire life for a moment's pleasure

169
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,704
that I realize that there are
moments in life

170
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,006
that you just can't miss
no matter what.

171
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,474
So let's just have fun!

00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,245

‐L‐O‐V‐E...
‐Come along.

174
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,883
We're going home, Kagura.

175
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,752
Aww, but I wanna see more.
I wanna stay‐ke sauce!

176
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,587
Stop letting it influence you!

177
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,392
Look, this is practically a cult.
It's so bad.

178
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:04,163
The air is just rank
with human stank. Hm?

179
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:08,134
‐Hey!
<i>‐L‐O‐V‐E Otsu!</i>

180
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,336
Louder, can't hear you!

181
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,407
<i>Sir! L‐O‐V‐E Otsu!</i>

182
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,642
You over there!

183
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:16,643
Where is your energy?

184
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,144
Shout like a man,
you maggot!

185
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,779
I'm so sorry, Captain!

186
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,749
Hey, since when did you become
the Captain of anything?

187
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:26,486
I've been a Captain of Otsu's fan club
from the day I was born, huh?

188
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,955
Gintoki, what the hell
are you doing here?

189
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,523
That's what I'd like to know.

190
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,993
I didn't think you were one to go
for this teeny bopper crap too.

191
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,930
How am I going to explain this
to your sister, after all?

192
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,399
What do you care what
I do in my spare time?

193
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,034
I'm not a little kid!

194
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,735
Excuse me, you there.

195
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,905
Please don't walk around the concert
hall during the performance.

196
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,741
You're spoiling it for the rest
of the audience of fans.

197
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,944
I'm very sorry, Miss Manager.

198
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,712
I'll throw this intruder out.

199
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,647
Oh, you're from the fan club?

200
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,149
I'll leave it to you then.

201
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,685
Today is the girl's
first live show

202
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,653
and we have to make sure
it's a success.

<i>"Your Father is Bleep Bleep"</i>

<i>I see.</i>

216
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,688
<i>So you're the one who is</i>
<i>managing Otsu, is that so?</i>

217
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:13,192
So the two of you, mother and
daughter, made it this far together.

218
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,761
That's impressive.

219
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,030
Hearing that from you
doesn't make me happy.

220
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,866
Not in the slightest.

221
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,402
I'm surprised you have the nerve
to show your face after all this time,

222
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,603
and now that I think about it,

223
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,438
aren't you still
supposed to be in jail?

224
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,340
Why are you even here?

225
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:35,048
I'm honestly amazed and I can see you
haven't changed one bit in 13 years.

226
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,285
You're free to live your life
however you please, you know,

227
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,520
but do you ever stop to think

228
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,056
that there might be people who
have to suffer for your actions,

229
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,757
people like your daughter and I?

230
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,327
For no other reason
than being your daughter,

231
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,763
Otsu has had to endure so much.

232
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,537
Hey, Otsu, what would you say is the key
selling point of your second single,

233
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:58,971
"Your Father is Bleep Bleep"?

234
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,940
I'd say it has to be
like the hidden meaning

235
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,742
behind the words
bleep bleep, you know.

236
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,878
What would make me the most happy
is if people would appreciate

237
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,747
it's more mature implications!

238
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,583
Otsu, tomorrow is your first
solo concert, right?

239
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:11,718
How are you feeling?

240
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,187
I'm feeling excited
to do my very best!

241
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,688
Come to think of it, Otsu.

242
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,690
Your mother is your manager,
isn't she?

243
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,524
Yes.

244
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,394
What does your father have to say
about your concert tomorrow?

245
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,863
My father...

246
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,201
Her father is not here
because he died 13 years ago.

247
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,636
Oh, is that true, Miss Otsu?

248
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,138
<i>She doesn't know what to say.</i>

249
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,511
It's nobody else's fault
but yours, you know,

250
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,646
that Otsu has had
to suffer like that.

251
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,615
Just go away, please.

252
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,418
And please never show up
in our presence ever again.

253
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,590
And don't force her to relive
any more painful memories...

254
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,794
like the fact that her father
is a murderer.

255
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,939
Hey, man, you want some gum?

256
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,308
What do I look like,
a teenage kid to you?

257
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,344
You know, the secret
to enjoying life

258
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,746
is to hold on
to the kid inside of you.

259
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,484
Well, busting out of jail just to see
your daughter's big moment on stage

260
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,120
is something you can't do
unless you're a childish idiot.

261
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,489
That's not how it is at all,
you idiot!

262
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,026
I once made a promise
to her a long time ago.

263
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:32,598
<i>♪I want to be a music idol.</i>
<i>La‐la‐la‐la...♪</i>

00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,207
<i>I'm gonna practice</i>
<i>and get better,</i>

268
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,209
<i>and one day become</i>
<i>a real idol singer.</i>

269
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,077
<i>If you could become</i>
<i>a professional singer,</i>

270
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,280
<i>then there's hope</i>
<i>for even the crickets.</i>

271
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,681
<i>Oh shut up, you meanie!</i>

272
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,950
<i>If I say I'll be</i>
<i>an idol singer, I will!</i>

273
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,485
<i>How about that,</i>
<i>my little girl?</i>

274
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,620
<i>Well, listen, if you ever</i>
<i>do go pro,</i>

275
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,088
<i>then I'll bring a million roses</i>

276
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,925
<i>and be the first to be</i>
<i>at your concert, alright, baby?</i>

277
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,726
<i>You absolutely mean that?</i>

278
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,329
<i>Yeah, I promise you I will.</i>

279
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,435
She's probably forgotten it by now.

280
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,170
That was 13 years ago.

281
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,574
Even if she did remember,
she'd probably want to forget it.

282
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:18,277
Not when she knows her stupid father
is a convicted murderer.

283
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:22,381
I can't even begin to imagine how much
she's had to suffer because of me.

284
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,483
She probably doesn't even
want to see my face.

285
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,887
I'm going back.

286
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,289
I forgot to buy the roses, anyway.

287
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,828
‐Sorry for all the trouble.
<i>‐Gintoki!</i>

288
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,097
What's up?

289
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,599
The venue has gone
off the walls

290
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,902
because some skitzo suddenly
went kablooey and...!

291
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,103
Speak normally.

292
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,972
I can't understand
a word you're saying.

293
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,707
What I was saying is...

294
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:49,942
there was this Amanto
in the concert hall.

295
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,778
<i>And the problem is, he is apparently</i>
<i>one of those nut jobs</i>

296
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:56,582
<i>from the Love‐Cannibal Clan</i>
<i>that eats the objects of their desire!</i>

297
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,087
<i>L‐O‐V‐E Otsu!</i>

298
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:08,828
I can't control myself anymore!

299
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,064
And that's why I came here
to report it to you, Gintoki.

300
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,901
So apparently, you can speak
normally, huh?

301
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,706
Hey, Captain!

302
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,809
Member number 49
has gone totally berserk!

303
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,177
Wait, he was one of us?

304
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,546
I thought he was some kind
of inflatable mascot!

305
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,548
Stop it, you big balloon!

306
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,151
Otsu!

307
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,991
I'm so hungry!

308
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:43,863
Otsu, my dearest,
become one with me...

309
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,165
inside my stomach!

310
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,267
Oh no, Otsu is in danger!

311
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,504
Oh! We have to get out
of here now, Otsu!

312
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:52,972
I can't.
My legs won't move.

313
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,440
What do I do?

314
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,261
Who... who on earth is that?!

315
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,697
Otsu, quickly make a run for it!

316
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,073
Hurry up and get him!

317
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,141
It's our duty to defend
Otsu as well, come on!

318
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:34,680
<i>Hey!</i>

319
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,283
Hang in there
and open your eyes!

320
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,921
Oh, look, he's awake.

321
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,556
You are crazy,
you know that?

322
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,324
Pulling a mad stunt like that.

323
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,960
But um... tell me,
who are you?

324
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,396
Just a very big fan of yours.

325
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,343
Kagura!

326
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,411
That's right, it's me!

327
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,880
I came to help
"you've got mail"!

328
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,415
What are you doing?

329
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:12,251
Just like in mine‐ority report!

330
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,588
Gintoki!

331
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:19,125
You better stop getting
in Duh‐way‐ne Johnson, then!

332
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,628
Well I think it's about time
you got lost‐ar is born!

333
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,339
Hold it right there!

334
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,809
I'm the one that's going to
protect Otsu girls one cup!

335
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,125
He went there?

336
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,094
Hey, old man.

337
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,137
Sorry, but that was
all I could find.

338
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,040
It's not quite a million roses,

339
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,576
but you can make up
for the rest with your affection.

340
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,547
You idiot.

341
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:19,852
<i>There's no way that she'd remember</i>
<i>that promise I'd made.</i>

342
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,559
<i>But at this point,</i>

343
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,695
<i>I guess it doesn't matter whether</i>
<i>she remembers the promise or not.</i>

344
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,831
<i>I'll keep my promise</i>
<i>for my own sake.</i>

345
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,907
<i>Otsu...</i>

346
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,410
<i>you'd better take it to the top.</i>

347
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,848
Hey there!

348
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,218
Next time, you'd better
bring roses, okay?

349
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,822
Until then, I'll always be waiting
for you on the stage, Dad.

350
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,724
I promise you!

351
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:10,236
Yo... you done with your emotional
farewells, pops?

352
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,170
You idiot.

353
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,640
This ain't a permanent farewell.
I swear.

354
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,575
I'll come back
to see her again.

355
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,647
Hey, everyone!

00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:25,451
