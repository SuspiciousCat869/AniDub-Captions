1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,704
Uh, to all you
boys and girls,

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,272
turn on the light
and sit up straight

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:06,506
when you're watching.

4
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:09,877
Be careful not to become
an adult like me or else.

5
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:10,577
That's all.

6
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,585
How's the time?

7
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,655
Uh, he should be
arriving very soon, sir.

8
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,690
He's very late.

9
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,293
I swear, Sakamoto had better
not be planning

10
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,128
to stand us up or else.

11
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:10,964
<i>Katsura, sir!</i>
<i>There!</i>

12
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,300
Looks like he's here.

13
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,067
Sakamoto is not with you?

14
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,403
<i>Well, he's wandered off</i>
<i>like he always does.</i>

15
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,304
He's one very troublesome boss.

16
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,507
Oh, of course.

17
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,242
And so then,
why did you call us out

18
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,710
to a place like this?

19
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,712
I brought you out here
because of this.

20
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,651
<i>It's some kind of present</i>
<i>from our boss.</i>

21
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,354
<i>And Katsura, it's addressed to you.</i>

22
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,588
<i>To me?</i>

23
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,320
<i>Th... this is...</i>

24
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,433
No way!

25
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,406
No way, you can't drop
your load here!

26
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,141
Your excrement is enormous!

27
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,276
It's bigger than the dreams
of a little kid, damn it!

28
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,544
There's no way!

29
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,312
Damn!

30
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,247
This is why I didn't want
to walk you!

31
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,282
She said: "I promise
to take care of him,"

32
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,685
but in the end
it's always the mother

33
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:15,622
who winds up taking care
of the dog every single time!

34
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,458
Hold on...
am I the Mom now?

35
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,962
You can't even train a pet,
can you, Gintoki?

36
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,132
How pitiful, if you can't
handle just one animal,

37
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,367
how do you intend to move
an entire nation?

38
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,970
And you dare to call
yourself a samurai?

39
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,938
Cobra!
What is that thing?

40
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,273
It's disgusting!

41
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:34,841
It's not disgusting.

42
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,042
It is Elizabeth.

43
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,278
Yeah, it wouldn't be so bad
if it was on its own,

44
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,047
but the sight of it standing right
next to you gives me the creeps.

45
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,516
Primarily because of you.

46
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,886
<i>That idiot Sakamoto dropped</i>
<i>by my place the other day</i>

47
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,454
<i>and left it behind.</i>

48
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,557
<i>He probably picked it up on</i>
<i>some foreign planet he visited.</i>

49
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,792
<i>It seems like he's gotten</i>
<i>himself totally caught up</i>

50
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,095
<i>with space travel as always.</i>

51
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,768
Hey man, aren't you supposed
to hate all kinds of aliens?

52
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:05,472
How could anyone possibly hate
an innocent creature like this?

53
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,740
And besides...

54
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,143
she's kind of cute,
don't you think?

55
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,613
Okay, let's go, Elizabeth.

56
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,782
Why don't we go
check out the riverbank?

57
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,585
Cobra, what the heck are you...?

58
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,290
Hey, I told you
not to do that!

59
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,826
Oh, holy crap!
It's huge!

60
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,727
And this smells like hell!

61
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,300
Good grief.

62
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,069
<i>Wow, Katsura of all people?</i>

63
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,538
<i>I'd never have expected</i>
<i>that from him.</i>

64
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:42,442
Yeah, well, I guess he's sort of
mellowed out these days.

65
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,644
I wonder if he would
take ours, too.

66
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,347
We don't need a roommate
who doesn't contribute anyway.

67
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,449
The only things he contributes
to this house

68
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,084
is feces and suffering!

69
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,920
That's not very nice of you
to say to Sadaharu!

70
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,122
Sadaharu, go ahead
and tear him a new one.

71
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,391
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

72
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,993
All right, I'm sorry.

73
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,028
Feces, suffering,
and also urine!

74
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,231
Okay, Sadaharu,
you can let him go now.

75
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,365
Let him go?

76
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,667
He didn't add anything
positive to that list!

77
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,371
Either way, pets are supposed to
be there to provide stress relief.

78
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,773
You shouldn't expect any other
compensation from them.

79
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,777
<i>Hello everyone, we're looking</i>
<i>for unusual pets for our show!</i>

80
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,580
<i>Ever since our country</i>
<i>opened up to the galaxy,</i>

81
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,116
<i>many different animals have</i>
<i>arrived with the Amanto.</i>

82
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,519
<i>Is there a strange pet living in your</i>
<i>neighborhood?</i>

83
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,256
<i>We'll be gathering all of the strangest</i>
<i>and cutest pets in Japan</i>

84
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,992
<i>on our show to crown one of them</i>
<i>the greatest pet of them all!</i>

85
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,928
<i>The winner will receive</i>
<i>a fabulous grand prize.</i>

86
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,232
Stress relief or a
fabulous prize?

87
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,667
Which would you rather have?

88
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,881
<i>You want one week?</i>

89
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,617
<i>Yeah, for sure.</i>
<i>If you wait a week,</i>

90
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,186
<i>I'll pay you the money</i>
<i>gift wrapped, so don't worry.</i>

91
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,389
I already feel like
an oil tycoon!

92
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,758
I'm gonna have all the pickled
seaweed I want!

93
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,128
Those are some pretty small
ambitions for an oil tycoon.

94
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,030
You three sure seem confident.

95
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,165
Well, do you have
some sort of a plan?

96
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,335
‐I do.
‐Unusual for him!

97
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,770
Sort of unusual for us.

98
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,806
I'm getting the feeling that
this plan is something fishy.

99
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,509
Ms Otose, you must not trust
what these guys say.

100
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:23,777
It's all just big talk!

101
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,111
You know it's all B. S.!

102
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,479
Because it always is.

103
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,014
Hey, you!

104
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,149
What are you doing
back here

105
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,950
as though nothing
ever happened, huh?

106
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,620
Aren't you supposed to be
behind bars right now?

107
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,260
Catherine was released
from prison on bail recently.

108
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,528
She had nowhere else to go,

109
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,930
so she came back here,
and I let her in.

110
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,966
You sure are an
eccentric old lady,

111
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,236
hiring this thief who ran off
with all of your shop's money.

112
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,706
Are you trying to reform her
or something?

113
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,407
It's nothing like that.

114
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,776
I just needed the help
in the shop.

115
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,413
Well, It's your store.

116
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,882
You can steal from others
but not from me,

117
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,484
you cat eared alien!

118
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,119
You don't even have
anything worth stealing,

119
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,288
you bird brained alien
who eats all day!

120
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,725
Be careful of what you say,
you old alien hag!

121
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,727
Want me to let some fish
rot in your mailbox?

122
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,729
If you don't wind up
eating it first,

123
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,864
you bottomless fat ass alien!

124
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,200
She has a point.

125
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:24,237
Well, you've all had the chance
to meet Catherine, then...

126
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,172
I'll wait one week.

127
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,141
If you don't pay me by then...

128
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,211
well, I shouldn't need
to tell you the rest.

129
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,590
Okay, Elizabeth, shall we go
and visit the park today?

130
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,260
Alright, let's go now.

131
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,463
Come on, bring it!

132
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,531
That's right, come on!

133
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,766
Whenever you're ready!

134
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,036
Okay, Sadaharu,
you just do your best.

135
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,242
Okay, go on, Sadaharu!

136
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:07,947
Sadaharu!

137
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:09,649
Right paw!

138
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:12,852
Sadaharu!

139
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,320
The left paw!

140
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,991
Sadaharu, sit now!

141
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,593
Hey, we can do this!

142
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,429
He's getting so much better!

143
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,964
Uh, could you tell him...

144
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,666
to be a little bit more gentle

145
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,768
before we get killed
during all this training?

146
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:30,603
He's right, Kagura.

147
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,907
We're risking our lives to teach him
the most basic of tricks.

148
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,209
What are you three doing?

149
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,279
Oh, it's you, Cobra.

150
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,548
My name is Katsura,
not Cobra.

151
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:44,217
But more importantly, I asked you
what you're doing here.

152
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,019
Can't you see,
or are you blind?

153
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,221
We're teaching Sadaharu
some brand new tricks.

154
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,923
Oh, is that so?

155
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,625
So you had a change of heart
and decided to take my advice?

156
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,627
Is that what happened,
Gintoki?

157
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,995
Don't be an idiot!

158
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,497
Who would ever have
a change of heart

159
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,265
just because of something
you said?

160
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,701
No, Sadaharu's going to be
on television.

161
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,702
Television?

162
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,904
That's why we're doing
some special training.

163
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,741
Not that it would concern anybody
with a bounty on their head.

164
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,578
Okay, now stand, Sadaharu!

165
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,082
Television.

166
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,421
<i>Don't worry about</i>
<i>being strange!</i>

167
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,923
<i>Being strange just means</i>
<i>that you're more original!</i>

168
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:29,062
<i>Welcome to our 7th Annual</i>
<i>Weird Cosmic Pet Grand Prix!</i>

169
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,436
<i>I am home!</i>

170
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,104
Hi, welcome back.

171
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,039
How did it go, Ms Otose?

172
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,574
Not good.

173
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,543
They all ran off again.

174
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,680
They run away every time
I go to collect the rent.

175
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:52,719
If I ever catch them,

176
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,621
I'll beat the living
daylights outta them.

177
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,557
Nothing you say is going to work
with people like that.

178
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,459
One rotten apple
spoils the batch.

179
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,395
The best thing to do is chase them
out before they ruin everything.

180
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,531
It's funny you should say that,

181
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,901
especially considering that you were
just released from prison.

182
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,470
Well, that was that,
and this is this.

183
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,039
You've sure got some nerve,
don't you, girl?

184
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,607
What?

185
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,543
Ms Otose, Ms Otose!

186
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,810
Look there, look there!

187
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,846
Shut the hell up!

188
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,981
Do you want to get thrown back
into a cell again?

189
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,384
No, look there,
look there, at the TV!

190
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:29,155
<i>From Kabukicho, Shinjuku,</i>
<i>a space creature named Sadaharu</i>

191
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,991
<i>and his owners,</i>
<i>the Sakata family.</i>

192
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,726
The Sakata family, is it?

193
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,596
What the hell are those
morons up to now?

194
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,898
This must be what
they were talking about

195
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,200
when they said
that they had a plan.

196
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,569
<i>The team that gets past</i>
<i>the preliminary round</i>

197
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,604
<i>will earn the right to face</i>
<i>our previous champion,</i>

198
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,507
<i>the Masked Mu family and</i>
<i>their pet, Miss Garter Belt!</i>

199
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,509
<i>Good luck, everyone!</i>

200
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,477
<i>Bring it on, challengers!</i>

201
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,515
I can't believe
we're actually doing this.

202
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,250
Remember that
we're playing to win.

203
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,518
Better get pumped up!

204
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,688
Uh, so... is Sadaharu
the thing that's clamped

205
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,289
onto you and won't let go?

206
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,825
Tell me Mr. Sakata,
are you all right?

207
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:06,693
I'm just fine.

208
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,561
Sadaharu is a very bright pup,

209
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,363
and he knows
how to hold back.

210
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,099
But it looks like
you're bleeding, sir.

211
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,969
Gintoki, the judges
are getting worried.

212
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,570
Stop the bleeding quickly!

213
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,973
Kagura, hurry up
and stop Sadaharu!

214
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,308
He won't listen to
anybody but you, Kagura.

215
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,509
Great!

216
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,116
Sadaharu, stop,

217
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,985
or you get no dinner
for tonight!

218
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,187
Do you want me to take
away your dinner, too?

219
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,458
Come on and
pull yourselves together!

220
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,194
There's no way we will make it
into the finals like this!

221
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:42,595
You think?

222
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,964
The judges can't seem
to take their eyes off of me.

223
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,799
Of course they can't take
their eyes off of you!

224
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,668
Go look at yourself
in a mirror!

225
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,004
But you both are just so stiff!

226
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,072
We need to use
the entirety of this stage!

227
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,074
Move your bodies
a little more!

228
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,543
You're the one
that's as stiff as a rock!

229
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,581
Uh, it seems like the owners
are more unusual than their pet.

230
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,317
I think we should cut
to a commercial break.

231
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,240
Alright, let's welcome
our next contestants.

232
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,378
Our next unusual pet today is...

233
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,580
the space creature Elizabeth,

234
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,383
and her owner,
the Space Captain Katsura!

235
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,654
What in the hell is he up to?

236
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,689
Unbelievable!

237
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:46,225
A wanted man disguising himself
just to get on television.

238
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,628
Well, I guess he really
loves his pet, then.

239
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:49,762
He likes his pet, alright,

240
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,098
but I think he just likes
wearing that costume.

241
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,200
So Katsura, tell us all.

242
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,335
What exactly is a Space Captain?

243
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,971
Of course, it is a captain,
but in space.

244
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,143
So you'll be facing
Sadaharu over there,

245
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,879
and the winner will be
advancing to the final round.

246
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,481
How confident are you?

247
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,051
That is just a regular
oversized dog.

248
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,221
My dog Taro back home
is about the same size.

249
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,756
What was that, Cobra?

250
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:19,992
Well, something like that penguin
monster of yours comes out of

251
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,662
the faucet whenever I turn it
on back at my place, too!

252
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:25,098
Could you not make up
such transparent lies!

253
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,133
It's time to appeal
to our judges!

254
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,502
Come on everyone
and give it up for them.

255
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,671
It's time for the first round.

256
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:35,007
Go ahead and show the judges
your pet's most attractive features!

257
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,510
As we always mention,
the judges will assign scores

258
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,146
according to their own
arbitrary judgment.

259
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,282
All right, let's begin
with the Sakata family.

260
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,618
This is your time to shine,
the stage is yours!

261
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,652
Sadaharu!

262
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,788
Let's show them the results
of your special training!

263
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,623
Oh, she's damn right we will.

264
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,292
We can't let all the blood we spilled
this past week go to waste.

265
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,327
Can we, Shinpachi?

266
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,863
I think spilled is
a big understatement.

267
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,531
Are you both ready for this?

268
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:01,167
Gintoki? Shinpachi?

269
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,102
Are you ready, Sadaharu?

270
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,171
It's okay.

271
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,739
Remember, just believe
in yourself.

272
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,409
Mommy knows that you're actually
incredibly talented, okay?

273
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,345
Gintoki, who are you talking to?

274
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,614
Okay, Sadaharu!

275
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,682
Let's go!

276
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,453
Sadaharu, right paw!

277
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,722
<i>Now the left paw!</i>

278
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,592
And for the final trick,
sit down!

279
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,495
Yes, that was just perfect!

280
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,698
It's no different than
the last time we saw this trick!

281
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,267
As if brute force and blood

282
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,302
are all it takes
to call something a trick.

283
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,672
My Elizabeth doesn't perform
such tasteless tricks as these.

284
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,809
Now, it's Elizabeth's time
to appeal to our judges.

285
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,377
It's all yours!

286
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,579
And now watch this!

287
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,983
Paper and paintbrushes?

288
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,985
What is she going
to do with... huh?

289
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,655
Now, show them
what you can do, Elizabeth!

290
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,633
<i>Oh, Elizabeth's painting.</i>

291
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,303
<i>She's painting like crazy</i>
<i>all of a sudden, look!</i>

292
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,210
Whoa!

293
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,444
What's that?

294
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,414
It's a peculiar
but spectacular painting!

295
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,983
It's as though a human being
had painted it!

296
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,019
Hey, announcer, what kind
of description is that?

297
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,088
You're being incredibly rude
to Elizabeth!

298
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,790
Uh... oh, yes, my bad.

299
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,327
I could paint way better
than that garbage painting!

300
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,395
No, that's not the point, Kagura.

301
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,563
Hey, it's all right, guys.

302
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,799
We win when it comes
to leaving a strong impact.

303
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,267
Don't worry about it at all.

304
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,603
The only winning quality
is blood spilled.

305
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,372
This is very fine work here.

306
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,142
I think this talent will achieve
quite a high score.

307
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,713
All right, judges, let's see
your scores for the first round.

308
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,120
Oh my God!

309
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,156
We've got quite a gap in points
straight from the very get go!

310
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,426
Will it be possible to turn
the tables of this contest?

311
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,496
Yeah... that's honestly
what I'd like to know.

312
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,899
This match is over.

313
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,840
Well, everyone, now it is time
to move on to round two.

314
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,709
I will toss
this fried chicken bone,

315
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,113
and the first pet that fetches
this bone back to its master

316
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,382
will be the winner of
this round of the game.

317
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,917
If you win this event,

318
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:34,787
you will receive 30,000 points
and win the game!

319
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,955
Hey, announcer!

320
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,491
Then what the hell was
the purpose of the first round?

321
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:42,762
Well, as a show, we needed
to build up the anticipation first.

322
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,330
Said who?
This is idiotic!

323
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,365
I demand you change
the rules right now!

324
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,767
Hey man, Cobra.

325
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,469
Would you quit whining at
the producers and play the game!

326
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,305
If you've got a problem,
then just go home!

327
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,205
What's that?

328
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,208
Now, now, this event
is going to determine the winner.

329
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,177
I wish the both of you
the best of luck.

330
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,246
Why don't we just skip
the boring ass contest,

331
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,914
and just duke it out
like real men?

332
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,582
I was hoping
that you'd say that!

333
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,284
No, this isn't your fight!

334
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,553
Cut it out, both of you,
damn you!

335
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,122
Hey, maybe we can win
this game, after all!

336
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,725
Elizabeth looks like
she's pretty slow on her feet,

337
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:13,926
doesn't she, Kagura?

338
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,232
Why don't you just
go home?

339
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,153
Okay, here we go,
everyone!

340
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,288
On your mark...

341
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,823
get set...

342
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,227
and.....

343
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,564
Go!

344
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,400
What do we have here?

345
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,002
You Idiot!

346
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,169
No, no, no!

347
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,239
No, come on!

348
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,577
It's over there, you idiot!

349
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,947
Sadaharu is starting
in the wrong direction

350
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,849
and is chasing
after his owner!

351
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:10,983
Stop, idiot!

352
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,319
I'm telling you,
it's the other way!

353
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,062
What's this?

354
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,564
Mr. Sakata charged
into the judges' table!

355
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,166
Hey stop that, you two!

356
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,635
Please don't destroy
the game show set!

357
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,638
Now, as for the unusual Elizabeth...

358
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:34,840
What speed!

359
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,977
Elizabeth was thought to be at
a disadvantage at first glance,

360
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,112
but she's running
at breakneck speed!

361
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,681
Are my eyes playing
tricks on me?

362
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,417
For an instant, I thought I saw what
looked like an old dude's leg.

363
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:45,184
There it is again!

364
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,552
It's a dude!

365
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,355
Enough with your false accusations!

366
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,924
Elizabeth trained very hard
just for today's game.

367
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,326
Don't call her an old dude.
Do you understand?

368
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,062
I'm... I'm so sorry.

369
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,363
Gintoki!

370
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,033
If you're going to run anyway,
just run toward the bone!

371
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,803
Hey, Kagura, you have
to call Sadaharu back!

372
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,273
Who are you talking to?

373
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,475
Don't come this way!

374
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,710
Stop, you stupid dog!

375
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,178
Look out!

376
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,213
Get out of the way!

377
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,882
I'm not moving
from this chair

378
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,820
as the owner of the Annual Weird
Cosmic Pet Grand Prix champion.

379
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,927
I can't just run away from you!

380
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,296
I'll take you on!

381
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:33,499
Miss Garter Belt,
execute Plan C!

382
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,010
Oh, wow!

383
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,113
Our champion seems
to have been defeated.

384
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,815
How are we going
to hold our final round?

385
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,828
Sadaharu seems to have finally
caught and pinned down Mr. Sakata!

386
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,564
What on earth is your
relationship, anyway?!

387
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,968
Hey, Gin, what will we do?

388
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,035
We're about to lose!

389
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,738
Sadaharu, it's time
for you to move.

390
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:17,109
Hey, look what I have!

391
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,944
Do you want
this piece of crap?

392
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,447
Come on, come on,
put me down, you damn brat!

393
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,650
And go!

394
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:26,952
Go?

395
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,934
<i>It appears Mr. Sakata</i>
<i>is using himself as bait</i>

396
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:44,670
<i>to lure Sadaharu</i>
<i>to the bone!</i>

397
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,706
<i>Sadaharu is charging,</i>
<i>he's like a rhino!</i>

398
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,875
<i>But Elizabeth is already</i>
<i>reaching for the bone.</i>

399
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,443
<i>She's almost there!</i>

400
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,882
There is no way in hell
I'm letting you have the prize.

401
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,652
You let go of Elizabeth
right now, Gintoki!

402
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,588
The prize belongs to me
and Elizabeth, you hear me?

403
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:07,726
Well, after everything
is said and done,

404
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,728
I guess you still
love your master.

405
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,331
But bite me any harder,
and I'll snap his neck.

406
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,832
So, what are you gonna do?

407
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,301
He's not gonna do anything!

408
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,936
He doesn't understand you!

409
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:20,206
You bastards, stop changing
the format of the contest!

410
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,441
We can't broadcast this if
you don't follow the rules!

411
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,375
Come on, man.

412
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,477
To hell with
your damn broadcast!

413
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,383
Oh, just screw it.

414
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:33,752
I'm sick of this crap.

415
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:36,889
I'm going home.

416
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,258
Can you just get off me?

417
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,570
Oh my God!
What on earth is going on?

418
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:55,908
That can't be.

419
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,443
Elizabeth...

420
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,490
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

421
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,225
<i>What happened to Elizabeth?</i>

422
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:17,563
<i>Hey, Elizabeth!</i>

423
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,789
<i>Until just a while ago, I was</i>
<i>headed up the highway to success</i>

424
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,392
<i>but I did that thing on a whim,</i>
<i>and I lost everything.</i>

425
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:54,626
<i>On the next episode...</i>

426
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,669
All I have now are my sunglasses.
