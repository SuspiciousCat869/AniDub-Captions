1
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:03,871
It's kind of depressing...

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:07,341
when your day ends just as the
sun has begun rising, isn't it?

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,711
I know this is the fate of a bar hostess,
but it's not healthy.

4
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:11,778
Really?

5
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,614
I actually think it's pretty nice...

6
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,449
While's the sun is down
we become the stars

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,417
that light up the darkness
of the night.

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:22,155
Besides, Bargain Dash ice cream
tastes so good after hard work!

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,459
Otae, I really envy how easy
going you always are.

10
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:26,693
I can't take it anymore.

11
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,397
Some samurai named Sakamoto was
all over my butt again tonight.

12
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,200
Honestly, just get used to it, Oryo.

13
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,036
I also told you to break their fingers
whenever they try to do that.

14
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,638
You're actually breaking fingers?

15
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,039
I thought we're the stars?

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,474
You're more like a black hole!

17
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,810
If only the new girl, Hanako,
could be as tough as you are.

18
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,979
She took off from work today, too.

19
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,447
I wonder what's wrong.

20
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:48,549
Who knows?

21
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,651
It's not all that unusual
in our line of work.

22
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:51,885
It's a pretty tough job.

23
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,189
Isn't that Hanako?

24
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,125
I wonder what she's doing over there.

25
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,629
Hey!

26
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,031
What are you doing, Hanaako?

27
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,999
D‐Don't come any closer!

28
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,467
Hanako, don't!

29
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,568
You aren't.

30
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,272
I was wondering what you were doing,
taking time off work, but this...

31
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,175
If you want to catch crayfish,
you need to find a shallow river!

32
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:16,476
What are you talking about!

33
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,111
Look at this situation, would you!

34
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,780
I just can't take it anymore.

35
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,281
I've had enough.
It's over...

36
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,583
Goodbye!

37
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,817
Look out!!

38
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:31,925
That was dangerous.

39
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,194
You're the one that's
really dangerous!

40
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,157
My sister sure is late.

41
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,293
And after I prepared a hotpot
now that I finally got paid.

42
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:16,563
She's probably spending time with
one of her customers after work.

43
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,964
The hotpot is ready.

44
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,400
Hey, what did you put in there?

45
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,701
It looks really dangerous,

46
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,204
like an evil witch's
bubbling cauldron.

47
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,572
I went ahead and
threw everything

48
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,607
that was in the
refridgerator in here.

49
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,444
Hotpots taste better the larger
the variety of ingredients.

50
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,045
How's it taste, Kagura?

51
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,082
I think it tastes like
the bottom of your feet.

52
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,084
Hey, hey, that's not good.

53
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,318
You've got WMD!

54
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,053
That's your own feet
you're talking about.

55
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,822
Now what are you going
to do about this?

56
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,957
I suppose I could try taking
more showers.

57
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,392
I'm not talking about your feet!

58
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,460
I'm talking about the hotpot!

59
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,627
I'm home.

60
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,096
Oh no.

61
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:49,996
She's back.

62
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,031
‐Sis is back...
‐Do we have any

63
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,300
ingredients left that can
save this thing?

64
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,101
That's it!

65
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,469
‐I'll put my feet in inside it!
‐She is back.

66
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,803
That should fix it!.

67
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,572
Two negatives make
a positive, right?

68
00:03:59,272 --> 00:03:59,973
‐Hm?
‐Hm?

69
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,209
Kagura, what are you
putting in there?

70
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,610
It's Bargain‐Dash ice cream.

71
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,446
Big sis said she loves
Bargain‐Dash ice cream,

72
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,448
so she's bound to love this.

73
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,650
Kagura, listen, you may as well.

74
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,320
just be flushing that ice cream
down the toilet.

75
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,921
Let's clean up.

76
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,289
It's better if we get rid of this!

77
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,858
Destroy all the evidence!

78
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:18,925
Stop that.

79
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,160
Don't give up.

80
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,262
‐It's only game over when we give up!!
<i>‐Hey, Shinpachi,</i>

81
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,064
<i>have you seen my</i>
<i>Bargain‐Dash?</i>

82
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,265
<i>I had it in the freezer.</i>

83
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:26,633
This is bad.

84
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,402
She's already noticed that the
Bargain‐Dash ice cream is missing.

85
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,837
Where's the ladle?!

86
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,005
‐It's hot hot hot...
‐Forget it!

87
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,573
‐It already melted away.
‐It's burning!

88
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,915
<i>How can I help you?</i>

89
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,416
‐One hundred cups of
‐One hundred cups of

90
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,618
‐Bargain‐Dash, please.
‐Bargain‐Dash, please.

91
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,785
Okay, sirs, you do know,

92
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,088
even if you collect a hundred
cups of Bargain‐Dash,

93
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,290
your wishes won't magically
come true.

94
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,160
Just bring me a hundred cups
already, baldy.

95
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,629
I'm so sorry.

96
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,030
I wanted to cheer
you up with some

97
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,299
Bargain‐Dash ice cream,
but I'm afraid...

98
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,934
I did my best to
stop them, Big sis,

99
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,036
but they're a really
hopeless bunch.

100
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,038
Well, at least we have
a hotpot going.

101
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,073
Hanako, dear,
help yourself to some.

102
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,175
Oh...

103
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:09,976
Oh wait.

104
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,478
You don't like hotpots?

105
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,980
You came here from Osaka,
didn't you?

106
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,349
Would you prefer Osaka
style cuisine instead?

107
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,584
Old Sucker?

108
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,785
Are you a migrant worker?

109
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,619
Me too.

110
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,720
We're alike.

111
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:22,989
Hanako...

112
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,257
Oh no, I'm sorry.

113
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,259
Ever since I came to Edo City,

114
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,828
I haven't experienced the kindness
of others like this.

115
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,766
I never knew such a kind person
like you existed here.

116
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,501
My dear Hanako...

117
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,069
Old Sucker, what's wrong with you?

118
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,537
Cheer up!
Have a drink!

119
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,905
Drinking makes everything better!

120
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,840
Don't let the city get the best of you!

121
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,211
<i>Hanako, listen you can</i>
<i>tell me what's wrong.</i>

122
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,348
I would like to do what every
is possible to help you out.

123
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,518
We both live in similar circumstances,
after all.

124
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,820
Otae, wow...

125
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,455
Really?

126
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,691
Are you really going
to help me out?

127
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,592
Sure.

128
00:05:58,592 --> 00:05:59,893
If there's anything I can do.

129
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,661
Umm, in that case...

130
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,530
This is difficult to say,
but will you.

131
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,532
I won't lend you any money.

132
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:08,935
Of course not.

133
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,871
But will, will you listen to my story?

134
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,176
Dream catcher?

135
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,077
That's right.

136
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,012
I fell for something pretty nasty.

137
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,116
I came to Edo City to fulfill my
dream of becoming a dancer...

138
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:27,120
but they seized all the money
I'd saved up for my dream.

139
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,888
What do you mean Hanako?

140
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,190
I was tricked!

141
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,626
They took advantage
of my weakness.

142
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,661
<i>Oh?</i>

143
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,463
So you want to become a dancer.

144
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,164
So that's why you're
saving up your earnings

145
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,532
working as a waitress.

146
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,767
That's very admirable.

147
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,602
I never knew there were
such respectable youths

148
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,703
in this day and age.

149
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,006
Yes but, you aren't
able to achieve

150
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,941
your dream with just ambition.

151
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,210
If you could, then the
world would be filled

152
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,880
with pilots and baseball players
and other winners as well.

153
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,283
Ambition is the power
to pursue your dreams.

154
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,250
But you need another power

155
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,185
in order to reach the
unreachable dream.

156
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,022
We call this incredible power
a dream catcher,

157
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,224
have you ever heard of it?
Have you?

158
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,192
A dream catcher?

159
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,360
That's right.

160
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,829
Most people would say that you
either have the power

161
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,364
to catch dreams or you don't.

162
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,701
That some people are born with
it and others are born without.

163
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,137
But the Dream Faith shows us
how to overcome

164
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,539
our innate handicaps in
order to achieve our dreams

165
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,107
and make everyone happy.

166
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,677
Do you know the one
thing that people

167
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,880
who achieve their dreams in this
world all have in common?

168
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,548
Tell me, do you?

169
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,185
Julius Caesar, Napoleon,
the soccer player Donaldo,

170
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,722
and the baseball player Chichiro
were all born with this power.

171
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,324
And while we were not,

172
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,460
we have succeeded
in producing it artificially.

173
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:42,729
And here...

174
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,097
it is!

175
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,480
What is that thing?

176
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,148
They said that all of the people

177
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,283
who achieved their dreams

178
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:06,052
had a mole with a hair growing
out of it on their body.

179
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,922
I spent a whole lot of money
for this stick‐on mole.

180
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,657
But nothing at all happened...

181
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,659
I was completely duped.

182
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,495
Are you totally stupid or what?

183
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,298
Are you going to let that tiny
bean dictate your life?

184
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,367
Were you planning on
dancing on the stage

185
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,868
with that dirty‐looking
mole on your face?

186
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,403
‐A hair growing mole
‐Come on, Old Sucker!

187
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,438
‐on a dancer?!
‐Get up from the bottom of the pit!

188
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:28,942
So now tell me...

189
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,310
What else happened to you?

190
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,044
There, there.

191
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,879
You did great, old sucker.

192
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,181
Next time, let's try
for thirty‐seconds.

193
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,917
I was forced to convert to
the Dream Faith Cult.

194
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,920
Also, I couldn't turn down
newspaper salesmen,

195
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,456
so I ended up subscribing
to nine newspapers,

196
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,592
and I bought 20 fire
extinguishers.

197
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,093
Edo City is so scary!

198
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,597
I just can't survive this
concrete jungle, I can't do it!

199
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,000
You wouldn't be able to survive in a
jungle filled with nothing but sloths.

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,102
Osaka is a heart‐warming town.

201
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,304
Naturally, there are
bad‐tempered people,

202
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,206
but everyone has a
certain warm spirit

203
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,641
you'd never expect
from a stranger.

204
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,810
But everyone in Edo City is so cold.

205
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,912
People treat each other like strangers.

206
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,615
I just...
I don't think I can get by here.

207
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:12,485
If you're suffering that badly, then
shouldn't you just go back home?

208
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,788
After all, you can dance anywhere,
you know...

209
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,357
As long as you keep
depending on others,

210
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:18,925
I didn't think you'll get
very far in life

211
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,160
no matter where you go.

212
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,561
But...

213
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,297
If you still want to pursue your dream
of becoming a dancer

214
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,199
in Edo City, then I'll help you out.

215
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,868
The Capital has its own way
of showing compassion.

216
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,236
Right...

217
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,204
Gintoki ?

218
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,383
Fellow believers!

219
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,651
Do you have a dream?

220
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,419
<i>We dream like crazy!</i>

221
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,422
And are you running towards
your dreams?

222
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,458
<i>We run like crazy!</i>

223
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:55,628
Well, everyone, what a joy it is
to see you all so full of faith!

224
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,597
If you continue chasing
your dreams here,

225
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,333
you might be able to catch
those dreams pretty soon.

226
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,070
So today, Hanako, who dreams
of becoming a dancer,

227
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,706
has brought us some
new dream chasers.

228
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,675
Let me introduce them to you all.

229
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,143
Hello there, guys!

230
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,845
Do you all have dreams?!

231
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,746
<i>‐We dream like crazy!</i>
<i>‐We dream like crazy!</i>

232
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:17,717
Otae Shimura, now tell us,
what is your dream?

233
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,085
My father's dojo.

234
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,520
I would like to rebuild it.

235
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,690
Hanako, dear, we all know
that your dream is to...?

236
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,925
To get my money back from
a phony relig...

237
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,728
<i>My dream is to eat</i>
<i>a giant bowl of rice</i>

238
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,664
<i>that has been covered with a</i>
<i>whole jar of seaweed jam.</i>

239
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,899
<i>But if it comes true,</i>

240
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,934
<i>I won't have anything</i>
<i>else to dream about,</i>

241
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,135
<i>so I'll keep it to myself!</i>

242
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,437
Is that so?

243
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,805
And you...

244
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,442
you probably just want better
eyesight or something boring.

245
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,110
Hey!
At least ask me!

246
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,346
And what is your dream?

247
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,313
My dream?

248
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,216
The thing is, I've misplaced that
a long time ago already.

249
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,318
Then what did you
come here to do?

250
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,021
Look, I just don't have what
I just don't have, okay?

251
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,191
How about "I want silky straight hair,
or something like that?"

252
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,093
Sure, I'll go with that, then.

253
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,694
Get out of here!

254
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,764
Those are the lamest dreams
I've ever heard of in my life,

255
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,999
so what are you after?

256
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,534
Are you really followers?

257
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,669
Maybe I still need
to be convinced.

258
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,571
After all, I hear that
you've got the power

259
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,907
to grant any dreams at all, so...

260
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,943
I wanted to see it with
my own eyes, of course.

261
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,278
Hey, Gin!

262
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,613
Aren't you forgetting why
we're here right now?

263
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,714
Just wait a second.

264
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,916
Before we get her money back,

265
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,652
shouldn't we reveal just
how phony this guy is?

266
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,287
Who are you guys, anyway?

267
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,756
We are not going to let
you make fun of Tom!

268
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,090
‐Get out!
‐Get out!

269
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,792
‐Get out!
‐Get out!

270
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,462
How amusing.

271
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,498
You really want
to see my power?

272
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,434
This is a utopia where
your dreams can come true.

273
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,904
If you can train here, I'll teach
you how to gain the power...

274
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,807
and the ability to grant
dreams just like me.

275
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,412
Dream...

276
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,717
Catcher!

277
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,388
What are you doing?

278
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:03,756
You said...

279
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,759
your dream is to have silky
straight hair, isn't that right?

280
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,695
Take a look at your hair now.

281
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:09,929
Oh!

282
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:10,930
But it's impossible.

283
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,165
Gin's mophead is...

284
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,901
Is silky straight!

285
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,946
Your hairstyle is
totally different, too!

286
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,448
Really?
You're joking, right?

287
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,449
Hey!

288
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:30,984
Wow!

289
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,452
It's all silky and straight!

290
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,054
It doesn't stick together
or stand up!

291
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:35,989
Yahoo!

292
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:39,258
Now it won't get all tangled
on rainy days!

293
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,594
Before you start celebrating,
grieve over that hair style!

294
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:43,630
Now do you see?

295
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,331
This is the power of
the Dream Catcher!

296
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,267
Those who believe in the
Dream Faith can gain this power.

297
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,004
The power to grant
everyone's dreams.

298
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,206
What is the meaning of this?

299
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,408
There must be some
sort of trick to it.

300
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,676
Right, Gin?

301
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:57,577
So...

302
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:01,614
I am a believer, I am yours
to command, Master Ham.

303
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,683
It's not Ham, it's Tom.

304
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,617
Hey!

305
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,819
It's not like Gin to bow
down to someone.

306
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,354
You need to get a grip, Gin!

307
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:09,656
Hey, you!

308
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,457
Give us the old Gin back, now.

309
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,160
What are you talking about?
This is my true self.

310
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,496
An evil priest put a curse
on me that turned my hair

311
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,064
into an ugly curly mess.

312
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,565
Don't say that, please!

313
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,501
Have confidence in yourself!

314
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,337
You're nothing if you lose
your mop‐top head!

315
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,241
Young lady, your dream was
to have a bowl of rice

316
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,777
with a mountain of seaweed
jam on it, wasn't it?

317
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,378
Okay, okay.

318
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,815
Dream.

319
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,920
Catcher!

320
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,855
Whoa!!
It really appeared!

321
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:47,126
I am a believer and I am yours
to command, Ham Man.

322
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,327
What do you mean "ham man"?

323
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,829
I told you, it's Tom!

324
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,265
He's got her too!
And so easily!

325
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:56,069
Everyone, let's celebrate!

326
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,605
We have recruited brand new
members into our Dream Faith!

327
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:03,176
Let's all achieve our dreams
and be truly happy!

328
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,211
Praise the Dream Faith!

329
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,447
Praise the Dream Faith!

330
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,682
Praise the Dream Faith!

331
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,921
<i>Dream...</i>
<i>Dream...</i>

332
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,556
<i>Catcher!</i>
<i>Catcher!</i>

333
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,324
You don't do it like that!

334
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,060
You are focusing too much
on the pronunciation.

335
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,929
You're not putting
any feeling into it.

336
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,598
Put feeling into it?

337
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,933
All right, then, I get it!

338
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,367
I think I can do it now!

339
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,470
Die, ugly man!

340
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,408
<i>That's</i> <i>just</i> <i>a</i> <i>bunch</i>
<i>of</i> <i>murderous</i> <i>intent!</i>

341
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,244
They forgotten why we came here
and fallen right into their trap.

342
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,113
Let's just leave those idiots.

343
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,750
Anyway, I'm beginning to understand
why he has so many followers.

344
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,052
They think they were
shown some miracle.

345
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,320
I wonder how he did it.

346
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:51,858
But Shinpachi, we didn't come here to
prove that he's a fraud or anything.

347
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,626
If you lose sight of your objective,

348
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,062
you'll end up just like those
idiots over there.

349
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:57,997
You're right.

350
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,599
We've got to get
Hanako 's money back

351
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,301
from that phony religious leader
and cut her a break.

352
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,970
No, that's not it.

353
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,972
We're here so we can
extort money from that

354
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:09,642
phony religious leader so that we
can rebuild our father's dojo.

355
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:10,576
What are are you saying?

356
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,878
I don't remember agreeing
to that objective!

357
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,312
Where did that plan come from?

358
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,914
Are you planning to use
the money stolen

359
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,849
from all these innocent people
for your own selfish purposes?

360
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,553
There's nothing wrong with taking
a little reward money, after all.

361
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,488
We're going to save
the rest of the money.

362
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,223
You're planning to take all of it!

363
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,059
So then, this was your plan
all along wasn't it?

364
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,861
Don't make me sound
like a corruption.

365
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,264
I intend to give Hanako's
money back to her.

366
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,367
Oh, wait, come to think of it,
where is Hanako?

367
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,370
Dream Catcher!

368
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,641
Seriously...

369
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,010
How many times are you going
to be fooled by them,

370
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,111
don't you ever learn?

371
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,879
Come on, take us to Jam's room.

372
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,148
‐It's Tom, Sis.
‐No, it's Tim.

373
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,617
I'm getting confused.

374
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,521
So tell me, what do you
plan to do, Otae?

375
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,490
We shouldn't stay here
for too long.

376
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,592
Let's go after the safe
in Tim Burt's room.

377
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,160
Tim Burt's room?

378
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,429
Since when did he become
a phony guru?

379
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,765
Breaking into his safe,
that's like stealing.

380
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,333
It doesn't feel right!

381
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,469
Hey, Hanako, exactly where
did you get those clothes from?

382
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,240
But if it's for the sake of
my dream, it can't be helped!

383
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,542
Hanako, try not to stand
out too much.

384
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,682
Hanako, just go back
to Osaka already.

385
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,518
Honestly, what fools they all are.

386
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,054
They can't even figure out
such a simple trick.

387
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,856
Are they completely blind?

388
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,924
Well, dreams do
make people blind.

389
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,393
Thanks to that,
I make quite a killing.

390
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,896
I can't quit being a
religious leader now.

391
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,937
This is all thanks to your power.

392
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,807
Why don't you come down from
time to time and have a drink?

393
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,009
Hey, you're up there, aren't you?

394
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,378
Owowow...

395
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:55,848
Oh, no.

396
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,184
Hanako, this is because
you moved around too much.

397
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,152
What are you three doing?

398
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:01,587
Ummm....

399
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,789
Owowowow.

400
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,325
This is going to make
me bald, definitely bald!

401
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,694
That hurt!

402
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,364
There's wig glue all over
this damn thing.

403
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,100
How did this guy manage to
do this in that one instant?

404
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,268
Hey Gin.

405
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,170
You look a whole lot better that way.

406
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,172
Hey, this is the men's bathroom.

407
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,375
So then he really was a fraud.

408
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,311
I thought you had completely
fallen for his guru act.

409
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,647
You thought I would really
believe this was for real?

410
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,849
I just wanted to investigate
and see what kind of tricks

411
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,984
he uses before making
my move, that's all.

412
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:33,786
M‐Me, too.

413
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,255
I acted like I was tricked,
so I could investigate.

414
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,357
I'd never being temped
by seaweed jam.

415
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,792
Yeah, yeah, I believe you.

416
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,493
It's true!

417
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,662
As proof, I dug up
some information on Tom.

418
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,331
Tom's done the exact
same demonstration

419
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,668
as he did with us in front
of his followers many times.

420
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,803
But it's only been
pathetic dreams

421
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,373
<i>like curing baldness or getting</i>
<i>a cheap knock‐off handbag.</i>

422
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,775
<i>He's only been</i>
<i>granting dreams</i>

423
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,144
<i>that are very easy to</i>
<i>grant and quickly.</i>

424
00:17:58,678 --> 00:17:59,845
He can prepare for anything

425
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,615
by asking his believers what
their dreams are beforehand.

426
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:05,518
But the question is how he
was able to make my wig

427
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,853
and your food appear instantly
out of nowhere.

428
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,389
Someone so fast they can't be seen.

429
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,424
Impossible.

430
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,458
A ninja!

431
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:13,993
I saw it on TV.

432
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,528
But that is so clichÃ©.

433
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:19,231
Owowowow.

434
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,300
This is bad.

435
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,735
I'm bleeding again.

436
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,971
I wiped my butt too hard.

437
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,741
Gin, Kagura!

438
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,677
Shinpachi, what's wrong?

439
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:32,878
You need to take a dump?

440
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,480
Are you about to crap
in your pants?

441
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,748
Bad news.

442
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,283
It's my sister and Hanako!

443
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,470
Everyone, I'm sorry to make this
unfortunate announcement,

444
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,039
but it appears that we have
traitors among us.

445
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,575
They had the gall sneak
into my room...

446
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,911
and they tried to steal
all of your offerings.

447
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,414
Do you think this is forgivable?

448
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:09,515
Never!
Die!

449
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,383
That's right.
Kill them!

450
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,083
Kill, kill, kill, kill...

451
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,185
Hey everyone, everyone,
open your eyes.

452
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,654
You're all being tricked
by this man!

453
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,521
Listen!

454
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,356
You bastard!
You threw a rock at me!

455
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,524
I'll remember your face!!

456
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,826
And I swear I'll kill you afterwards!!

457
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,829
Now I will leave the punishment
of these traitors...

458
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,533
in your hands, my dearest followers
and Dream Faith believers!

459
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,503
Dream Catcher holds the power
to grant wishes!

460
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,172
Everyone, wish intently for the
sort of punishment

461
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,874
you want them to receive‐Ow!

462
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,542
Hey, that really hurts...

463
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,677
And, these criminals
will get the punishment

464
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,547
they deserve without us lifting
our own fingers.

465
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,883
My eye!!
Damn it!

466
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,418
Dream Punishment?

467
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,253
We should just kill them for this!

468
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,823
It's been decided.

469
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,224
You will be punished with death.

470
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,560
Just try to kill us, you fraud.

471
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,995
If you think you can.

472
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,164
You just talk about dreams
and wishes,

473
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,331
but you don't do anything.

474
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,067
You're all such naive people.

475
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,835
Oh, Otae.

476
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,370
You think a mere fraudster

477
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,772
like you could have any
power over us at all?

478
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,742
How can you be so confident
at a time like this?

479
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,577
You have nothing to be
confident about.

480
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,848
Because we believe in something
that is far more powerful than you!

481
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,616
What could be
more powerful,

482
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:18,984
than dreams?

483
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:21,754
That would be...

484
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,089
our friends.

485
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,390
What's that?

486
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,058
Hey look. There's someone
on top of the roof!

487
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,859
Wh‐What?

488
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:27,793
Where is he?

489
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,628
Hey, Gin!

490
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,330
He's over there!

491
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:34,967
Got it!

492
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,536
Dream Catcher!

493
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,072
Unveiled!

494
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,944
Oh!
It's a ninja!

495
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:46,579
What's this?

496
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,581
Someone just fell from
the beams of the roof!

497
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:49,882
Hey!
Hattori!

498
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:50,750
What are you doing?

499
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,485
Get back up there right now!

500
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,320
Do you realize how much
I'm paying you?

501
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:55,921
I‐I can't.

502
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,557
S‐Something stabbed
me in the butt.

503
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,292
Stop fooling around,
you moron!

504
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,660
I picked you up off the streets

505
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,597
after the elite secret agent
organization fired you!

506
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,732
Without you, I'm just
a middle aged man.

507
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,467
Sorry.
But I'm quitting.

508
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,402
Toilet paper here is so cheap,

509
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,738
I feel like I'm wiping my butt
with a cheese grater.

510
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:13,906
Later!

511
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,407
Hey!

512
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,443
I‐It's a ninja...

513
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,445
Why does Tom have a ninja?

514
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,147
<i>You still don't get it?</i>

515
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,884
<i>This</i> <i>is</i> <i>the</i> <i>truth</i> <i>behind</i>
<i>the</i> <i>Dream</i> <i>Catcher.</i>

516
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,418
<i>Think back.</i>

517
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,020
<i>Did he ever make a</i>
<i>dream come true</i>

518
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,523
<i>that wasn't simple and easy</i>
<i>to see or provide?</i>

519
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:31,390
<i>No!</i>

520
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,758
He preinterviewed

521
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,827
<i>all</i> <i>his</i> <i>followers</i> <i>and</i> <i>chose</i> <i>only</i>

522
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,829
<i>dreams that were easy</i>
<i>to grant in person.</i>

523
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,998
<i>He kept a ninja hidden</i>
<i>in the beams</i>

524
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,933
<i>and acted as if he was</i>
<i>performing miracles</i>

525
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,268
<i>with a speed of light...</i>

526
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,336
<i>You were all tricked by this!</i>

527
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,905
Impossible.

528
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,974
We would never fall for such a
simple trick as that, you know!

529
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,209
Yeah, that's right.

530
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,344
I was bald, but now
I have so much hair!

531
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,646
Hey, this is a wig!

532
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,413
It's true.

533
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,682
Why the hell didn't you notice that
before, huh?

534
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,885
Well, I didn't touch it 'cause I didn't
want my new hair to fall out!

535
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,221
Hey, Tom, you bastard!

536
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,822
How dare you trick us like that!

537
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,157
Give us back our money!!

538
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,196
Where do you think you're
going, Guru?

539
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:13,165
Why don't you use your
Dream Catcher to get out of this.

540
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,101
‐Pray to your hairy mole for help!!
‐Pray to your hairy mole for help!

541
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,843
<i>In the end, he was like us...</i>

542
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,681
<i>he was just a pathetic man who</i>
<i>was blinded by his own dream.</i>

543
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,217
<i>That's right.</i>

544
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,518
But the only thing different,

545
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,620
is whether you have people
to help you out

546
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,822
and get you back up on your
feet when you sink.

547
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:40,359
If I ever start drowning,
you'll help me out,

548
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,694
won't you. Hanako?

549
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,297
Of course, Otae.

550
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,100
Next time, I'll show you Osaka's
warm hearted spirit.

551
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,474
D‐D‐Dream Catcher.

552
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,177
Please let me win big at a casino.

553
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,346
What are you
doing up here, Gintoki?

554
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,506
<i>Hey, Gin, I want to eat</i>
<i>a steamed pork bun!</i>

555
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:35,708
<i>I don't have any.</i>

556
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,444
<i>If you want a steamed pork bun,</i>
<i>ask Santa for one.</i>

557
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,511
<i>You can't fool me.</i>

558
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,747
<i>Everyone knows Santa</i>
<i>doesn't really exist!</i>

559
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,015
<i>The next episode...</i>
