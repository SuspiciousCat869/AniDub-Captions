00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,437
<i>The land of the samurai.</i>

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,205
<i>There was a time,</i>
<i>a long time ago,</i>

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:07,507
<i>when our country</i>
<i>was called by that name.</i>

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,976
<i>With the arrival of...</i>

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,612
<i>Hang on! Can't we just skip</i>
<i>this narration already?</i>

6
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:12,980
<i>Yeah, I'm really getting sick of it.</i>

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,749
<i>Oh, but there might be people</i>
<i>watching this for the first time.</i>

8
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,000
<i>Don't bother.</i>

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,519
<i>It's a world they wouldn't understand</i>
<i>even if we explained it, anyway.</i>

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,121
<i>They can follow along</i>
<i>at their own pace.</i>

11
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,923
<i>As they say,</i>
<i>"Insolence is bliss!"</i>

12
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:25,392
<i>Not knowing the word ignorance</i>
<i>proves that you're real!</i>

13
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,290
<i>Pesu! Pesu!</i>

14
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,058
I am very sorry, Sir.

15
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,395
We looked for him everywhere,
but we couldn't find him.

16
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,498
It appears that he is no longer
on these grounds.

17
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,202
Are you joking?

18
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,238
But, chief!

19
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,241
Do you think "we couldn't find him"
is going to cut it?

20
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,342
But... but we...

21
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,511
I don't need your back talk,
Hasegawa.

22
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,747
You Edo officials
have just one job,

23
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,049
and that's to shut up
and do as we tell you!

24
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,085
Use whatever means necessary
to find him, you useless swine!

25
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,722
Oh, Pesu! Pesu!

26
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,657
You heard me!
Now get moving!

27
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,993
Yes.
Sorry, sir.

28
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,129
‐Pesu!
‐But, chief!

29
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,630
We must prevent word of this

30
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,266
from leaking to the upper
echelons no matter what.

31
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,569
Yes, I know,
and I have a plan.

32
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,974
<i>Enough, you useless</i>
<i>mop top punk!</i>

33
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,710
You're gonna pay me every last penny
of all the rent that you owe,

34
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,111
and you'll pay me me today!

35
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,348
Yeah, I heard you,
I heard you.

36
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,051
Guess I don't have a choice.

37
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,086
Here it is.

38
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,691
<i>Adios.</i>

39
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,531
Hold on! What do you think
you're doing handing me 53 cents?

40
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,000
You're not buying a comic book,
you worthless punk!

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,268
That's all I have!

42
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,869
I said that's all I have!

43
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,971
Try to understand that much,
you old bat!

44
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,106
If you don't have money,

45
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,875
why don't you go and swindle
a rich old hag or two?

46
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,677
Man up and grow a pair,
mop top!

47
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,580
All you ever care about
is money, money, money.

48
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,082
How petty are you?

49
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,117
If you want someone to seduce you,
why don't you just say so...

50
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,318
‐...you thirsty old hag?!
‐What?

51
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,221
If you just wanted to get with me,
you should've said so from the start!

52
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:41,922
Gross!

53
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:44,691
If you're trying to make me puke,
I'd be happy to oblige you!

54
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,127
‐You want a flood of complaints...
‐Hey, chief, that's the place.

55
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,128
<i>...from the very start</i>
<i>of this episode?</i>

56
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,963
Look, I'll just wait
one more day!

57
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,133
If you still can't pay the rent,
then you're out of here for real!

58
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,568
Let's go.

59
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,875
What are you going to do?

60
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,911
She even took the 53 cents you were
going to spend on your comics.

61
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,280
You better pay me
this month's wages, anyway.

62
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,682
I'm counting on you.

63
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,051
It's tough enough trying to survive
on what little I have.

64
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,054
Like surviving a train ride with
the smelly breath of old guys.

65
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,123
‐Shinpachi?
‐Yes?

66
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,091
You don't have a girlfriend
at all, do you?

67
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,926
What's this, all of a sudden?

68
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,262
Are you interested in going out
with an older woman at all?

69
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,731
Otose is single and available.

70
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,936
No freaking way!
What do you take me for?

71
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,072
I'm a young man
in the prime of my youth!

72
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,874
Don't get your panties
bunched up, man.

73
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:34,741
The thing about money,

74
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,878
is that it doesn't come to guys
who really want or need it.

75
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,313
It only comes to people
who seem pleasant

76
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,116
but only try to cause mayhem
in the lives of others.

77
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,718
Well, that would be
you two then!

78
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,687
You two alone cause more mayhem
and chaos than anyone else I know!

79
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,923
Come on!
The tube is on the fritz.

80
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,658
Oh, it's coming in.

81
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,326
<i>Maya Sizitzy is at the scene!</i>

82
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,161
<i>Hello, Maya!</i>

83
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,563
<i>Hello, this is Maya Sizitzy</i>
<i>at the scene.</i>

84
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,832
<i>It appears that the mysterious</i>
<i>giant organism</i>

85
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,700
<i>that appeared at Oedo Hot Spa</i>

86
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,435
<i>has destroyed the facilities</i>
<i>in the area</i>

87
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,004
<i>over the course</i>
<i>of the last several hours,</i>

88
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,605
<i>only to mysteriously disappear.</i>

89
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,875
Hey, hey, another mysterious alien
got out of the Sky Terminal again.

90
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,410
There have been
quite a few recently.

91
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,411
Come on, guys!

92
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,079
Right now, whats more
important than the alien

93
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,015
is how we're going
to manage our finances.

94
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,517
‐What?
‐What?

95
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,718
That old hag!

96
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,390
If it's about the money, I already told
you I don't have any, you rotten hag!

97
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,295
What's that?

98
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,699
Hey, chief!

99
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,700
What's your problem?

100
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,001
What do you think you're doing?

101
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,469
Sorry about that,
my mistake.

102
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,971
I'll come back another time.

103
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,439
Hold it!

104
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,945
You're the Odd Jobs man, right?

105
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,580
That's why you're coming with us.

106
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,848
Sorry to disappoint you guys,

107
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,185
but my mother always told me
that it's not wise to follow strangers.

108
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,122
Didn't she also teach you that
it was not wise to disobey the law?

109
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,391
You're with the government?

110
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,594
We are with
the Immigration Bureau,

111
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:04,297
and we came here to hire you
for a job, Mr. Odd Jobs.

112
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,805
<i>When you say Taizo Hasegawa</i>
<i>of the Immigration Bureau,</i>

113
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,874
<i>you're talking about that big</i>
<i>shot government official</i>

114
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,976
<i>who oversees all</i>
<i>Amanto immigration?</i>

115
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:16,876
A big shot?

116
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,678
Does that mean he has
a big schlong?

117
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,213
He's got an enormous one.

118
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,215
No, it means he is
an important person.

119
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,084
And you know, Kagura,

120
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:27,020
you really shouldn't be saying
such things like that in a show.

121
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,457
At any rate, what do you think a
government bigwig wants with us?

122
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,093
What do you want with us,
Mr. Big Schlong?

123
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,828
Odd Jobs Gin, was it?

124
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,063
I heard there were some people
who would do anything

125
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,598
as long as I paid
the right price.

126
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,567
So, I've come to ask you
to do a job.

127
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,270
Do a job for you?

128
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,372
I didn't know you guys
even worked at all.

129
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,873
Look around town man,

130
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,276
because the Amanto are doing
whatever they please.

131
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,279
That's pretty harsh, man.

132
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,781
We're doing everything we can
these days, you know.

133
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:16,636
Besides, the Capital has developed this
far primarily thanks to those aliens.

134
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:20,407
<i>On top of that, they really seem</i>
<i>to like this place.</i>

135
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,242
<i>We can't be reckless.</i>

136
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,613
<i>The Amanto already have their networks</i>
<i>rooted in the heart of the government.</i>

137
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,684
<i>So it's best to stop dreaming about</i>
<i>driving them off of the Earth one day.</i>

138
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,124
The only option we have left is to try to
coexist with them to protect our kind.

139
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,095
Coexist, eh?

140
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,265
And do you honestly enjoy
doing your job?

141
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,271
Well, never mind.

142
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,273
So, what do you want us
to do then?

143
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:57,644
Uh? Well, it's a job that
we can't carry out in the open.

144
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,747
If it becomes public,
the government will lose face.

145
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,684
The fact is that the government is
currently in a diplomatic crisis

146
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:08,321
that could have a decisive influence
on the future of our entire country.

147
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,192
<i>Prince Hata from theo Midland Star</i>
<i>is staying in the Capital.</i>

148
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,994
<i>And the prince happens</i>
<i>to have a small problem.</i>

149
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,600
My precious pet, my dear Pesu, seems
to have disappeared somewhere.

150
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,403
Might I ask you
to collect him for me?

151
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,475
Hey, hold on you three!

152
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,578
You guys are
the Odd Jobs right?

153
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,313
You're supposed to do
anything, right?

154
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,382
No, I know!
I know how you feel!

155
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,250
But take the job, please!

156
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,286
Shut up or I'll break your shades,
you ugly government dirt bag.

157
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,522
And I'll yank off
your sad little beard.

158
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,858
Fine, you can break my glasses,
yank off my beard,

159
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,126
but just take the job!

160
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,927
We're seriously in trouble here.

161
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,330
Our government borrowed quite
a bit of money from his country,

162
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,631
if you catch my drift.

163
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,766
Why would I care about that?

164
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:53,833
It's your problem.

165
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,169
If this country's going to collapse
because of a mere pet,

166
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,370
then, it should collapse then.

167
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,872
What do you mean by
a "mere pet"?

168
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,141
Pesu is like a member
of the family.

169
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,910
Then, please look for
your pet yourself, Prince Kaka.

170
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,247
Hey! It’s Prince Hata, not Prince Kaka!

171
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,382
You should forget those
who walk out on you,

172
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,984
and prepare for a new love.

173
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,553
That's what an independent woman
of this day and age would do.

174
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,254
Listen to me!

175
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,889
He wasn't dumped,
and he isn't a woman!

176
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,057
He may be a pinhead,
but he's still a prince!

177
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,159
‐He's still a prince!
‐Yes he's a pinhead...

178
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,693
...but he's still a prince, right?

179
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,462
That's right.
A pinhead, but still a prince!

180
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,196
I get it.

181
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,931
A pinhead, but still a prince, eh?

182
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,966
So like I said,
he's a pinhead prince.

183
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:27,967
Listen to me!

184
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,769
He's a pinhead,
but he's still a prince.

185
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:30,737
You peasants!

186
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,306
It's disrespectful to call
the Pinhead Prince a pinhead!

187
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,842
But you just called me
a pinhead as well.

188
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,645
Can't you handle a problem
like this all by yourselves?

189
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,213
Why hire us?

190
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,817
Well, the thing is, we have
our reasons for needing help,

191
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:48,121
but we also figured it would be
right up Mr. Odd Jobs' alley.

192
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,323
No, we may be called Odd Jobs,

193
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,225
but we haven't lost
sight of ourselves

194
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,862
to the point where we would wag
our tails for the government officials

195
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,497
and do their errands for them.

196
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,066
Let's go, Shinpachi,
Kagura.

197
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,335
See ya, Big Schlong.

198
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:11,744
Just so you three know, we intended
to compensate you very generously.

199
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:13,880
Well then, what do we
have to do?

200
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,616
We are prepared to do
anything you say, master!

201
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,184
Talk about a quick transition?

202
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,886
You guys are such sellouts!

203
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,623
What I want you to try to find is
this octopus like alien named Pesu.

204
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,259
It's probably wandering
around the city.

205
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,562
I want you to capture it unharmed and
bring it back here before tomorrow.

206
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,838
Do you really think Pesu
would be in the harbor

207
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,840
just because it looks
like an octopus?

208
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,175
It doesn't matter anyway.

209
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,243
It can be anything.

210
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,678
All we need is one hook,
and we can go from there.

211
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,413
It’s like speed‐dating parties.

212
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,986
Mm... octopus jars!

213
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,890
You know fishermen set those up
and just wait for the octopus.

214
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,260
Are you some emo teen
who can't confess his love?

215
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,630
Waiting around doesn't find you love
nor will it help you find an octopus.

216
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,765
Stop saying silly crap
and let's go.

217
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,449
I know a lot about sea octopuses,

218
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,785
but I don't know anything
about land octopuses.

219
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,655
Why not ask a shop
that sells land octopuses?

220
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,958
These dumplings have
octopus inside,

221
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,294
but I've never seen one
that looks like this.

222
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:37,363
Hey, Sabu, ever seen an octopus
that looks like this?

223
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:39,899
Yeah.

224
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,702
I think I saw something like that
at the shop on the main street.

225
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,239
What? You wanted something
from me?

226
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,240
‐Pesu!
‐Pesu!

227
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,309
Okay, I get it,
but no way!

228
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,312
Come on, don't you think they look
kinda similar here around the eyes?

229
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,546
You probably look
like your father!

230
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,048
Or maybe you look
like your mother?

231
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,115
Stop this!

232
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,750
She's a human being!

233
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,753
Are you people making fun
of me for my looks?

234
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,221
Okay, I've got it.

235
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,790
From today on,
you'll be Pesu.

236
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,959
What? My name is Vanessa,
you punk!

237
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,329
Yes, but from today on,
you'll be Vanessa, aka Pesu.

238
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,497
Just Vanessa is fine with me!

239
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,100
Couldn't you just come
with us for now?

240
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,068
Enough of this!

241
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,503
We're supposed to be looking
for an alien octopus!

242
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,838
Alien octopus?

243
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,873
Hold on.
Have you seen one around?

244
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,842
Now that you mention it,

245
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:26,045
a girl who works here said
that a stray octopus alien

246
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,315
was caught by the Humane Society
and taken away.

247
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,318
‐That looks like...
‐Let's go, Shinpachi!

248
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,853
‐Kagura!
‐Right.

249
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,622
See ya, Pesu look a like.

250
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,523
I said my name is Vanessa!

251
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,861
Gintoki, step on it
or we won't catch up.

252
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,695
Its fine!

253
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,064
In my opinion, it's more fun
to chase than be chased.

254
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,067
That's how young girls grow up to be
adults, by enjoying the chase!

255
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,904
There it is!

256
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,172
Let's go!

257
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,947
‐Whoa!
‐Hey, wait!

258
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,330
Dude it's just a squid.

259
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,670
Listen, this is just like going after a
delicate young girl with a broken heart.

260
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,239
We mustn't chase
after it too far.

261
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,909
The heart of a teen that runs away
from home is also a delicate one.

262
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,945
Adults don't understand
anything about adolescents.

263
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,948
Okay, Gintoki after all
the searching we did,

264
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,650
we've come back
to the octopus jars?

265
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,054
You know, octopuses like
being in jars.

266
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,956
Normally, you have to die
before they can put you in a jar.

267
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,059
You're talking about urns
for ashes.

268
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,595
Listen, Gin, wasn't I trying to tell you
about this idea from the beginning?

269
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,597
It's just a tad different,
I'd say.

270
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,400
If searching around doesn't work,
we'll just wait here patiently.

271
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,936
You just got tired
of searching, really?

272
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,473
Even after the three of us
running around all over the place,

273
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,608
you really think that
this is going to work?

274
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,010
It'll work out.

275
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,412
Well...
you know what?

276
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,781
It's okay.
It'll work out in the end.

277
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,284
Do you know the meaning
of the word responsibility?

278
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,887
This is exactly why guys like
you always end up getting dumped.

279
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,622
I think you're wrong about that.

280
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,623
Give them some sweet talk,

281
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,393
and any woman or octopus
will come wagging their tail.

282
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,894
Women don't have tails.

283
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,096
Neither do octopuses.

284
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,797
You were the one
who said that!

285
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,670
I don't believe it!
He really fell for it!

286
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,072
And who might you be?

287
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,240
Vanessa?

288
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,442
No, it's not!
It's Pesu. Pesu!

289
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,544
‐Pesu?
‐Pesu?

290
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,346
Get him!

291
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,416
‐No, wait, stop!
‐No, wait, stop!

292
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,020
Hey, stop squirming!

293
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,522
We're not some
teenage fan girls

294
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,090
scorned by her boyfriend
and treated gently

295
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,992
by another man, you know!

296
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,294
But In that case, the second guy
has all the advantages

297
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,763
of the first guys mistakes!

298
00:14:56,763 --> 00:15:00,032
In this case, our priority is
to chase after Pesu, you guys!

299
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,236
What are we going to do?

300
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,637
‐We can't get out!
‐Fine then!

301
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,072
We just have to roll!

302
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,515
Whoa, this is totally <i>déjà vu</i>!

303
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,650
Holy cow!
Pesu is fast!

304
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,385
‐We'll never catch him like this!
‐Idiots!

305
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,221
Once your feelings start to run
downhill, there's no stopping them.

306
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,358
If we don't catch him you got to date
some rich old hag, Shinpachi!

307
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,528
Married women are hot, too!

308
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,763
How is any of this
all my fault?

309
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,733
Look out!

310
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,545
He's flat as a pancake!

311
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:49,382
Chill out and help me
find a time machine, okay?

312
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,850
You need to chill out!

313
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,685
And that again?
Seriously?

314
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,669
Sorry to keep you waiting.

315
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,037
Here's what you asked for.

316
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,441
Pesu!

317
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,243
That thing looks completely dead!

318
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,544
I said unharmed!

319
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,346
Its face is totally discolored!

320
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,547
It's all right.

321
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,916
Girls of this age tends
to use too much makeup.

322
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,818
It happens a lot
during adolescence.

323
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,955
All we did was flatten it with
a jar and it turned out like this.

324
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,890
What a total weakling!

325
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,225
You piflattened it with a jar?

326
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,893
You did this on purpose?

327
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,695
Listen, it's not dead yet, man!

328
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:36,963
It's just barely alive.

329
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,031
"Just barely alive"
is the problem!

330
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,934
Leaving aside the fact
that it isn't unharmed,

331
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,670
we should be thankful that
it didn't cause too much damage

332
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,839
while it was wandering
around in the city.

333
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,040
Too much damage?

334
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,508
What do you mean by that?

335
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,678
The seas on the planet where
that thing came from are very warm.

336
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:56,582
Pouring hot water on it will return
Pesu to its original size and state.

337
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:57,884
Hot water?

338
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,218
Stop!

339
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,753
What do you think
you are you doing?

340
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,956
Boiled octopus!

341
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,292
What are you thinking, girl?

342
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,328
Enjoying it in a delicious manner
is the best memorial service!

343
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,632
Oh, it's coming along perfectly.

344
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,268
What... what did you do,
you idiot?

345
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,271
Pesu?!

346
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,106
No way!

347
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,475
Didn't you hear what he just said
about the water?

348
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:23,910
Oh, my Pesu!

349
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,444
Pesu's come back to life!

350
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,948
Yeah, I can eat
my fill of octopus!

351
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,983
Well now look.
It's alive again!

352
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,286
As if you had anything
to be proud of!

353
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,026
Whoa! It's pretty strong
for an octopus!

354
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,561
You never told us it would grow
into a giant like that!

355
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,797
I didn't tell you,
because you didn't ask!

356
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,334
Give me a second, and I'll shut
that punk octopus up for good!

357
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,368
Hold on.

358
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,104
Don't you think you've done
enough already?

359
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,740
Don't injure it more
than you already have.

360
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,143
Oh, I remember now!

361
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,179
Is this that creature we saw
going on a rampage on TV?

362
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,181
How're we supposed to capture
something like this?

363
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,817
For that matter, how were you
keeping it as a pet?

364
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:09,755
Pesu is actually an unknown organism
we discovered on a remote planet.

365
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,190
He became attached to me,

366
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,961
so I tied him to the back of my ship
and brought him home with me as a pet!

367
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,799
Seems like he's not
attached to you anymore!

368
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,835
It must be low on calcium.

369
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,340
Oh, no!
It's headed for the city again!

370
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,347
Hey, Gin!

371
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,982
Come on then.

372
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,718
Kagura, go and buy
some soy sauce.

373
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,586
We're having octopus sashimi
for dinner tonight.

374
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,588
Awesome idea.
Soy sauce, it is!

375
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,924
We're feasting tonight!

376
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,593
No, maybe dumplings
would be better.

377
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,962
It's lunchtime!

378
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,931
Not happening!

379
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,268
What was that for?

380
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,437
Is that my brain leaking out?

381
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,206
Stop trying to hurt it!

382
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,707
The prince told us
to capture it unharmed!

383
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,908
Capture it unharmed!

384
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,043
Unharmed?!

385
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,511
Is that even possible?

386
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,713
That's why I hired you,
Mr. Odd Jobs!

387
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:08,814
Now make it happen!

388
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,450
Nope, nope,
not happening, nope.

389
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:14,920
‐Gin, help!
‐Shinpachi!

390
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,225
I'm not letting you
injure that creature!

391
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,994
‐Help! It's going to eat me!
‐You jerk!

392
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,898
I know perfectly well that capturing
that thing unharmed is impossible.

393
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,633
That pinhead prince
won't get the message

394
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,969
until that creature's body
count goes up a bit.

395
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,405
Hello! Are you listening to me?!

396
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,874
So I see you're using
my sidekick as pet food

397
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,609
to get permission
to kill that thing?

398
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:40,179
It seems like you government guys
really are rotten to the core.

399
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:44,216
I told you, we have no choice
but to coexist with the Amanto.

400
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:48,320
Corrupt or not, I'm going to protect
the country the way I see is best.

401
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,690
That's my warrior code.

402
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,026
‐So I see then.
‐Huh?

403
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,896
I'm gonna follow
my warrior code too!

404
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,868
Hold on!

405
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,905
It's one human being
versus a whole nation.

406
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,673
Think about which
is more important!

407
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,709
I don't give a damn about that!

408
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,345
Shinpachi!
Hold on!

409
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,415
Hold on, he says.

410
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,284
Damn it!

411
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,020
I don't really care whether
the government collapses

412
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,888
or the nation falls apart!

413
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,025
Until the day my body
turns to ashes,

414
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,062
I swear that I'm living my life
doing what I think is right!

415
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,432
Gin, I got the soy sauce!

416
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,344
Oh brother, that bastard's messed
everything up!

417
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,847
My precious Pesu!

418
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:50,382
My precious Pesu!
My precious Pesu!

419
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,218
He's turned into a fountain.

420
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,129
Hasegawa!
What's the meaning of this?

421
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,865
I told you to capture him
and bring him back unharmed!

422
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,633
How will you take
responsibility for this?

423
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,335
It's an intergalactic incident!

424
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,403
Hey, are you listening,
damn it?!

425
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,839
<i>Do what I think is right?</i>

426
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,511
<i>It's almost like the goals</i>
<i>a kid sets in grade school.</i>

427
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,147
<i>Come to think of it,</i>
<i>my mom always used to tell me.</i>

428
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,216
<i>"Screw the rules, my son.</i>

429
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,951
<i>Follow your heart."</i>

430
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,923
And do you honestly
enjoy doing your job?

431
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:37,496
<i>Mother, am I following</i>
<i>my heart right now?</i>

432
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,765
Hey, Gawa... Hasegawa!

433
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:43,736
I swear I'm going to tell my father
all about this, Hasegawa!

434
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,304
Shut up.

435
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,640
‐Shut up!
‐Hey!

436
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:51,343
‐Stop!
‐Shut up you freakin' space flounder!

437
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,089
So, was it the right thing
to do that, you think?

438
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:06,659
As if I care, moron.

439
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,694
This here is the land
of the samurai.

440
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,364
I'm not going to let them
do what they please.

441
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,203
But you won't be able
to police the Amanto anymore.

442
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,205
You'll be canned
for this for sure.

443
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:20,673
Boy, you're dumb.

444
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,210
People who act on sheer impulse
always end up ruining their lives.

445
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,179
What?

446
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,911
<i>Gin, will you stop lying around</i>
<i>and get up already?</i>

447
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,715
<i>Take this seriously! It's only been few</i>
<i>episodes since the series started!</i>

448
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,250
<i>With the star of the show like this,</i>

449
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,085
<i>we'll be cancelled before</i>
<i>the end of the season!</i>

450
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,086
<i>The next episode...</i>

451
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:21,493
By the way, Kagura, what is
that you've been eating?

452
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,329
Octopus dumplings!

453
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,097
Yuck!
