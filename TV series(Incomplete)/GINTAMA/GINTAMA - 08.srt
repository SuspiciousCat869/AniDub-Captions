00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:13,040
<i>They swiftly deal with any</i>

<i>We've come here for an inspection!</i>

00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,390
<i>We're the Shinsengumi!</i>

17
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,436
The Shinsengumi?

18
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,904
What are you doing
with a television crew

19
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,739
if you're here for an inspection?

20
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,041
And what are you doing
singing karaoke at a party

00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,277

the government?

22
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:51,778
You've got some nerve!

23
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,410
Arrest them!

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Why you!

25

You know there's no use

30
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:28,949
What a pain!

00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,752

Do you hear me?

00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,190
You're an exclusionist but
you asssumed you had time

35
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,925
to get cozy with
a wench, huh?

36
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,203
Amazing!

37
00:02:58,979 --> 00:02:59,780
What's this?

38
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,781
Where's Chief Kondo?

39
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,216
Yeah, come to think of it.

40
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,151
Where did he go?

41
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,287
Our honorable chief is a lot
more modest than we all are.

42
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,757
He said that he didn't want
anything to do with a TV exposé.

43
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,193
Wow, that's the chief for you!

44
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,963
He's probably having a discussion
with some government bigwig

45
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:20,700
or silently cleaning his sword
in solitude right about now.

46
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,445
<i>Oh,</i> <i>my</i> <i>butt</i> <i>hair</i> <i>is</i>
<i>really</i> <i>just</i> <i>too</i> <i>thick.</i>

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,016
<i>There's no way any girl</i>
<i>would ever go out with me.</i>

48
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,652
I'm no good, am I?

49
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,821
That's not true at all.

50
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,191
Butt hair is very manly,
and I think that's great.

51
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,027
Then let me ask you this.

52
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,330
‐Say, if you had a boyfriend and...
‐Hmm?

53
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,100
...if his rear end looked like an afro,
what would you do?

54
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,676
I would love him,
butt 'fro and all.

55
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:05,645
What a goddess!

56
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,781
She actually accepts everything!

57
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,583
She's just like the Buddha.

58
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:15,555
‐Huh?
‐But... but... but... but...

59
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,690
‐...but will you marry me?
‐Huh?

60
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:39,846
<i>What is this?</i>

61
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,715
<i>Someone asked you</i>
<i>to marry him?</i>

62
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,351
Are you being serious
about this, sis?

63
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,620
I'm being serious.‐

64
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,422
A customer actualy proposed
to me yesterday.

65
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:52,025
So, what did you say?

66
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,495
Of course, I had to politely
turn him down.

67
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,099
He sure surprised me though!

68
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,268
I can't believe how stubborn
he got about it,

69
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,836
even though we'd just met.

70
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,771
Otae, dear!

71
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,879
In the end,
he was so annoying.

72
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,582
I had to pop him in the schnoz
and make a run for it.

73
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,884
I... is that true?

74
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,686
Well, I can't imagine
what kind of person...

75
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,354
Otae dear!

76
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,490
Otae dear!

77
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,926
Will you please marry me?

78
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:31,531
I'm not the kind of guy who gives up
after being told no once, or even twice!

79
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,568
My mother always used to tell me
that women find more happiness

80
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,803
in being loved than
in loving someone!

81
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,104
Hey, loser!

82
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,474
What the hell are you doing
yelling up there?

83
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,277
You're bothering the entire
neighborhood, idiot!

84
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,845
Hey, relax, officer!

85
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,248
I'm innocent!
I may...

86
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,350
I may be a thief, alright...

87
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,286
but I only steal hearts.

88
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,255
Wipe that smug grin
off your face!

89
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,357
That was the corniest line
I've ever heard!

90
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,159
Get down here right now!

91
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,162
Now, Otae, dear!

92
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:05,332
Won't you at least show me
your angelic face for one moment?

93
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,100
Oh, Otae, dear!

94
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,417
<i>The Shinsengumi start</i>
<i>their mornings early.</i>

95
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,254
<i>They begin their preparations</i>
<i>very early in the morning,</i>

96
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,223
<i>so they can jump</i>
<i>into action at any time!</i>

97
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,893
Put some spirit into it!

98
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,931
Anyone who skips out on morning
training will be committing harakiri!

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,735
Early morning, huh?

100
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,036
Early morning.

101
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,973
If the vice chief says it's early morning,
it's early morning.

102
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,545
This ain't early!

103
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,115
10 AM is not considered
early in the morning!

104
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,049
Hush you maggot!

105
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,952
A man with fierce determination
can make anything happen!

106
00:06:58,952 --> 00:06:59,653
Whatever!

107
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,055
This is more fabrication
than determination.

108
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,590
Are you playing badminton, maggot?

109
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,760
Come to think of it.

110
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,828
I haven't seen Kondo today either.

111
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,463
Is he like on vacation
or something?

112
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,198
He isn't like you, Okita!

113
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,600
We're talking about the chief.

114
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,203
I'm sure that he's out vigorously
training alone by himself somewhere.

115
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,073
Oh, just what you'd expect
from Chief Kondo.

116
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,809
Chief Kondo really is
something else, isn't he?

117
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,544
I really admire him.

118
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,682
You sure got a really strange admirer,
don't you, sis?

119
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,084
Well, yeah, it really is a bother.

120
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,887
Okay then, dinner will be...

121
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,256
Eggs again?
Not eggs again!

122
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,757
Seriously, sis?

123
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,693
Don't be so judgemental about it.

124
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,361
Eggs are packed with nutrition.

125
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,263
Then let me do the cooking, please,

126
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,032
and you can just do
the shopping around town!

127
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,167
Sure.

128
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,602
Phew, her fried eggs?

129
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,738
They aren't fried eggs at all.

130
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,674
They're poor, innocent,
horribly abused eggs.

131
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,277
Oh boy!

132
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,914
I guess it can't be helped.

133
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,289
"Come with me for a load?"

134
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,191
‐What does that even mean?
‐Wait, sis!

135
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,503
Otae, dear!

136
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,804
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

137
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,807
I may not look it,
but I'm quite the athlete.

138
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,477
My hobbies include both
tennis and scuba diving.

139
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,213
Sparkle!

140
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,351
Do only one at a time,
not both, you freak!

141
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,324
<i>The Shinsengumi have many</i>
<i>different duties and responsibilities...</i>

142
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,964
<i>and directing the traffic in the great</i>
<i>City of Edo is also one of them.</i>

143
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:55,735
Hey, you there, stop now!

144
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,204
Who allowed you to do
a U‐turn in this intersection?

145
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,739
Don't you dare run away!

146
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,775
Anyone who runs
is gonna get cut!

147
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,810
Now, now, Hijikata.

148
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,546
Come on, don't let your temper
get the better of you.

149
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,815
What you need to do
is just leave it to me.

150
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,350
I'm not leaving any...

151
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:15,889
Oh, God.

152
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,425
Hijikata, you always take
things to such extremes.

153
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,261
Don't try to pin this on me, Okita!
This is on you!

154
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,564
<i>So that's the whole story, Gin.</i>

155
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,200
<i>What</i> <i>do</i> <i>you</i> <i>mean</i> <i>"thats</i> <i>the</i>
<i>whole</i> <i>story,"</i> <i>you</i> <i>little</i> <i>shit?</i>

156
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,870
How many minutes has it been
since the show started?

157
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,640
I'm the main character, so don't
you think it's problematic...

158
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,110
that it's taken so long
to finally get to me?

159
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,745
Eleven minutes, ten seconds.

160
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,413
This is Gin Tama, isn't it?

161
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,315
Isn't it?
Hey! Come on!

162
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,083
Right?

163
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,951
The show can't begin
without Gin!

164
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,821
Why call it Gin Tama
if I'm not on screen?

165
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,690
Well, it seems like the title
of today's show is

166
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,594
"Up close! 24 Hours with
the Shinsengumi Armed Police!"

167
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,329
That's what I saw, at least.

168
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,363
What the hell?

169
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,631
I haven't heard about that!

170
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,100
That's because you never seem
to care about the show.

171
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:04,871
At this rate, the Shinsengumi are going
to be the real stars of this anime.

172
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,139
Seriously?

173
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:07,874
Now that you mention it,

174
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,409
we haven't played
the Gin Tama opening yet!

175
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:10,944
That was a close one.

176
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:11,978
This is Gin Tama

177
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,880
and I'm the star of this show!

178
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,974
Aren't you glad that there's someone
who actually wants to marry her?

179
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,609
If he had a sword in his belt,

180
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,611
it probably means he works
for the government.

181
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,413
This is your meal ticket, baby!

182
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,583
Get hitched before he discovers
what you're really like!

183
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,686
What's that supposed to mean?

184
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,490
At first, I thought he was going to
finally give up his pursuit of me,

185
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,426
so I didn't give it much thought.

186
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,895
<i>But then he started showing up</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

187
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,698
That guy is really not normal.

188
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,633
All right, thirty seconds left.

189
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,902
Hurry, hurry!
It's the home stretch!

190
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,339
Swallow without chewing, Kagura!

191
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,208
I didn't bring cash
so I'm really counting on you.

192
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,677
Are you two even listening?

193
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:25,578
What do you mean?

194
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,513
What do you want me
to do about it?

195
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,650
If you want me to take a job,
then show me the money.

196
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:34,621
Gin man, I haven't received
a paycheck in over two months.

197
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,889
So why don't you
show me the money?

198
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,058
Well, I would if you paid me.

199
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,362
Come on. If you don't find some
motivation you'll be replaced.

200
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,831
Stalker‐Perv, where are you at?

201
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,866
I'm serving you
a bowl of justice!

202
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,501
What did you just say,
scum bucket?

203
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,236
I'd like to see you try it!

204
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,571
He really was here.

205
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:55,208
Boy, you sure are stupid to come out
when someone calls for a stalker.

206
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,544
Have you decided to admit
the fact that you're a stalker?

207
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,650
Well aren't we all stalkers when
it comes that elusive prey love?

208
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,817
Listen, jerk!

209
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,687
I saw you getting all chummy
with Otae a moment ago.

210
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,956
Just what the hell
is your relationship with her?

211
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,558
I'm uncontrollably envious of you!

212
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,927
This is my <i>fiancé</i>.

213
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,530
We're actually going to
get married this upcoming fall.

214
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:18,831
Oh, really?

215
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,235
The truth is, we've already done
all kinds of things together.

216
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,537
So please forget about me
and move on.

217
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,306
You... you've done
all kinds of things?

218
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,242
Even those kinds of things?

219
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,878
No, nobody mentioned
those kinds of things.

220
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,280
No, its fine, Otae.

221
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,749
I don't care about
what you've done in the past.

222
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,686
I accept you entirely,
just the way you are.

223
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:40,219
Huh?

224
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,423
The same way you love me,
butt 'fro and all.

225
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,624
I don't love you.

226
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,226
Doh! Hey, you silver haired moptop!

227
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,063
It doesn't matter whether
you're Otae's <i>fiancé</i> or not!

228
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,299
I know that I love Otae
more than you ever could!

229
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,934
I challenge you to a duel!

230
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,500
The winner takes Otae!

231
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:17,890
Oh, I really shouldn't
have lied like that.

232
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:21,761
Yeah, it seems like it just made things
even more complicated than before.

233
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,730
And that guy down there,

234
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,164
he knows how to fight.

235
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,834
Look how calm he is
right before his duel.

236
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,269
Like he's faced certain
death many times before.

237
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,571
Don't worry about him.

238
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,740
If Gin is in any danger...

239
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,410
my umbrella will unleash
hell on earth, Big sis.

240
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,212
Try not to kill them, okay?

241
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,113
Hey, four eyes!

242
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,280
Where did he go?

243
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,082
Who are you calling "four eyes"?

244
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,084
And he said he had to go
to the can!

245
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,987
That's... that's awfully nonchalant
of him before a duel!

246
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:56,095
<i>Our reporting team has received information</i>
<i>about an unruly drunk downtown.</i>

247
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,597
<i>We've headed to the scene!</i>

248
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,967
<i>You idiot!</i>

249
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,336
<i>The hell's wrong with drinking</i>
<i>during the day?</i>

250
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:06,472
<i>Why</i> <i>don't</i> <i>you</i> <i>show</i> <i>me</i> <i>where</i>
<i>the</i> <i>law</i> <i>that</i> <i>makes</i> <i>it</i> <i>illegal</i> <i>is?</i>

251
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,775
<i>Edo's protectors,</i>
<i>the righteous Shinsengumi,</i>

252
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,977
<i>have already arrived</i>
<i>on the scene.</i>

253
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,146
<i>Arrived on the scene.</i>

254
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,181
<i>Arrived on the...</i>

255
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,452
<i>Now they come?</i>

256
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,853
They just got here?

257
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,157
You...!

258
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,026
‐You...!
‐Hey, you drunk baboon!

259
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,862
Don't bother trying to resist,
come with us.

260
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,764
What?!
You're calling me a drunk?!

261
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,966
I'm barely even tipsy,
you little...!

262
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,569
You...!
Yeah, you little...

263
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,805
Hey, do we have permission
to kill him, Hijikata?

264
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,072
No, calm down.

265
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,574
The cameras are rolling right now.

266
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,143
Stop trying to murder people
every single chance you get.

267
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,617
You bastard...

268
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,886
Am I wrong or is that
your mom's spaghetti

269
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,955
sliding down my leg right now?

270
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,456
You just signed
your death war.

271
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,525
Hey, everyone, hold Hijikata back!

272
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,027
You imbeciles, let me go!

273
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:04,297
I'm going to drag him around town
through the dirt and cut his head off!

274
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,133
<i>Vice chief, calm down!</i>

275
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,768
<i>The cameras are still rolling!</i>

276
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,269
<i>Get the camera</i>
<i>out of my face.</i>

277
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,554
What are they doing?

278
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,590
Apparently they're having a duel!

279
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,625
A duel? Wow!

280
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,328
You rarely see that
these days, am I right?

281
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,164
Hey, rice crackers
and caramel candy!

282
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,832
How about a soda?

283
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,234
Hey, is he ready yet?

284
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,336
He didn't run off
like a coward, did he?

285
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,437
Dumb ass!

286
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,139
What reason do I have to
run away from someone like you?

287
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,507
Finally!

288
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:49,942
What took you so long?

289
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,110
Were you taking a dump?

290
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,212
Don't you know that heroes
don't take dumps?

291
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,615
I just needed a bump.

292
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,553
Never heard of a
hypoglycemic hero before!

293
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,689
Nice sunset.

294
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,124
Beautiful, isn't it?

295
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,663
A sunset is like a sword
to a samurai.

296
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,099
You're pretty well spoken

297
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,434
for a silver haired mop top.

298
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:19,572
And you understand human language
pretty well for a gorilla, I'd say.

299
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,407
I... I'm not a gorilla!

300
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,809
I may look like one,
but I'm not a gorilla!

301
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,111
Whatever then.

302
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,380
So shall we get started or what?

303
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,382
Wait, do you have a weapon?

304
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,485
If you want to use a real sword,
I'll lend you one.

305
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:33,786
It's up to you.

306
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,455
This is more than good enough
for me, buddy.

307
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,024
Let's get this show started.

308
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,926
Do you think this is a game?

309
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,228
Well, Im so sorry to disappoint you,

310
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,030
but I'm not about
to determine the fate

311
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,198
of somebody else's life
over our duel.

312
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,201
It might not be
much of a substitute,

313
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,903
but I'll wager
my life instead.

314
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,274
If I wager my life
instead of Otae's,

315
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:59,011
even if you win,
Otae won't become yours,

316
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,947
but I'll be out
of the picture then.

317
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,450
You are free to go on and continue
to try to get her to love you back.

318
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:08,721
Of course, if I win, you’re gonna have to
keep your paws off her, you got that?

319
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,359
<i>He's willing to face a</i>
<i>real blade and protect me</i>

320
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,696
<i>even if it means risking his own life</i>
<i>in exchange for mine?</i>

321
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,265
Wait!
Stop this now!

322
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,936
‐What?
‐You sure are a man amongst men.

323
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,773
Well, I take it you're more popular
with men than with women.

324
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,545
Hey, kid, lend me
your wooden sword!

325
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,750
You're quite the man
yourself, so use that.

326
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,352
It's my favorite sword.

327
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,753
Go ahead, use it.

328
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,154
Gin, catch!

329
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,759
Win or lose today, we aren't holding
any grudges, are we?

330
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:47,893
Sure.

331
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,495
You got it.

332
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,030
Let's fight, man to man.

333
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,668
Let's go!

334
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,836
A fair...

335
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,571
‐Fight!
‐Fight!

336
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:01,907
What's this?

337
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,609
Hold on a second!
The blade!

338
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,644
Wait, wait, wait,
the tip... tip is...

339
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,513
‐Argh!
‐...the tip is gone!

340
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,922
You're so naive,

341
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,091
more naive than the flavor
of my bottled water.

342
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,794
I can't believe you'd take
a weapon from your enemy!

343
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,030
<i>When I went to the john,</i>

344
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,400
<i>I</i> <i>scored</i> <i>it</i> <i>with</i> <i>a</i> <i>deep</i> <i>cut</i> <i>so</i>
<i>it</i> <i>would</i> <i>split</i> <i>from</i> <i>being</i> <i>swung.</i>

345
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:28,834
You bastard!

346
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,536
You'd really go that far?

347
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,505
Only a total dork like you

348
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,608
would put their lives on the line
for something stupid like this.

349
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,644
This harmlessly resolves everything,
don't you think so, buddy?

350
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,313
Do you call this harmless?

351
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,818
Hey. So wha'dya think
of my brilliant plan?

352
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,789
‐I've lost all faith in you!
‐You feel satisfied now, cheater?

353
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,324
You coward!
I can't even believe you!

354
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,026
Wait! What are you saying?

355
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,161
I defended your sister with...

356
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,129
I'm going home!

357
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,031
I never want to see
your face again!

358
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,766
I'm going on vacation
for a while.

359
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,339
<i>Harmlessly resolves everything?</i>

360
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,476
<i>Oh well, seems like Gin</i>
<i>got the worst of it</i>

361
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,011
<i>trying to protect me.</i>

362
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,747
What did I do to deserve
this treatment?

363
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,449
What a total klutz.

364
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,520
But I think I'm starting
to understand you.

365
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,995
<i>The Shinsengumi's vice chief,</i>
<i>Hijikata arrives.</i>

366
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:34,767
<i>Quietly, he patrols the city by himself</i>
<i>even after a long day of work.</i>

367
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,203
<i>But what is this?</i>

368
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,306
<i>What is it that arrests his</i>
<i>ever searching gaze this evening?</i>

369
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,842
What's all the fuss?

370
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,679
Well, apparently there was
some kind of duel over a woman.

371
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,614
A duel over a woman?

372
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,716
How stupid!

373
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,485
What idiot would bother to...

374
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,186
Oh, Chief Kondo.

375
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,988
Chief Kondo?

376
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,857
That's the Shinsengumi's chief.

377
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,825
Is that Isao Kondo?

378
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,894
You idiot!
Why are you filming this?

379
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,065
<i>And so, thanks to the work</i>
<i>of the Shinsengumi,</i>

380
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,267
<i>peace in the Capital</i>
<i>has been upheld.</i>

381
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,137
<i>Really though?</i>

382
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,600
<i>Where's the guy that</i>
<i>attacked Chief Kondo?!</i>

383
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,970
<i>He may be a gorilla, but that man</i>
<i>is also our beloved leader!</i>

384
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,506
<i>A silver‐haired samurai?</i>
<i>You're that guy from…!</i>

385
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,141
<i>The next episode...</i>
