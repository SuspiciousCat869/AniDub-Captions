1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,503
<i>Well, it's Gin Tama's</i>
<i>six month anniversary</i>

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,938
<i>since the show started!</i>

3
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:07,074
<i>Yeah, although for a while,</i>
<i>I was like</i>

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>"Damn they're totally</i>
<i>gonna cancel our show."</i>

5
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,811
<i>We made it by the skin</i>
<i>of our teeth.</i>

6
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:13,013
<i>Yeah, but, no one</i>
<i>expected us to last,</i>

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,349
<i>so apparently nobody</i>
<i>prepared anything at all</i>

8
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,583
<i>for the upcoming episodes.</i>

9
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,285
<i>Whatever, it doesn't matter.</i>

10
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,021
<i>They can just make one of those clip</i>
<i>show episodes to fill the gaps.</i>

11
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,756
<i>We can fool everyone</i>
<i>as long as we are sure</i>

12
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,192
<i>to insert two or three</i>
<i>new clips into the episode.</i>

13
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:25,926
<i>Hey!</i>

14
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:29,162
<i>Well then, why don't we go down</i>
<i>memory lane with the past episodes?</i>

15
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,365
<i>We've sure been through a lot,</i>
<i>haven't we?</i>

16
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,133
<i>Like Shinpachi getting</i>
<i>stuck in that ditch,</i>

17
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,968
<i>and Shinpachi puking in his sleep,</i>

18
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,069
<i>and Shinpachi puking in his sleep...</i>

19
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,638
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>That's such a lie!</i>

20
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,439
<i>And</i> <i>why</i> <i>are</i> <i>you</i> <i>mentioning</i>
<i>puking</i> <i>twice?</i>

21
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,274
<i>Enough puking!</i>

22
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:43,143
<i>That's the idea, Shinpachi, recap</i>
<i>everything that's happened until now.</i>

23
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:43,944
<i>No thank you.</i>

24
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:46,213
<i>Real men don't dwell on the past.</i>

25
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,582
<i>You're beginning to talk big for a</i>
<i>Shinpachi!</i>

26
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,051
<i>I</i> <i>guess</i> <i>a</i> <i>person</i> <i>changes</i>
<i>if</i> <i>you</i> <i>give</i> <i>them</i> <i>six months.</i>

27
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,452
<i>Oh yes, they change.</i>

28
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:56,223
<i>In</i> <i>six</i> <i>months,</i> <i>this</i> <i>little</i> <i>weakling</i>
<i>has</i> <i>turned</i> <i>into</i> <i>a</i> <i>macho</i> <i>lover</i> <i>boy.</i>

29
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,591
<i>That's not true, Kagura!</i>

30
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:58,692
<i>Absolutely not true!</i>

31
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,595
<i>Order</i> <i>now</i> <i>and</i> <i>get</i> <i>an</i> <i>extra</i> <i>can</i>
<i>of</i> <i>protein</i> <i>powder</i> <i>free</i> <i>of charge!</i>

32
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,396
<i>No thanks!</i>

33
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,664
<i>I still have some cans at home.</i>

34
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:04,798
<i>You actually ordered some?</i>

35
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,833
<i>I was a naive and unsuspecting child.</i>

36
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,470
<i>A</i> <i>jug</i> <i>of</i> <i>snake</i> <i>oil</i> <i>works</i> <i>better</i>
<i>than</i> <i>those</i> <i>silly</i> <i>workout</i> <i>products.</i>

37
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,172
<i>Those don't work!</i>
<i>You're being fooled!</i>

38
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,741
<i>She</i> <i>means</i> <i>using</i> <i>the</i> <i>jugs</i> <i>as</i>
<i>weights</i> <i>for</i> <i>your</i> <i>workouts.</i>

39
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,276
<i>Is your name Jackie Chan?</i>

40
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,345
<i>And besides, Jackie's already a grandpa!</i>

41
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:21,081
<i>Oh</i> <i>man,</i> <i>when</i> <i>did</i> <i>I</i> <i>stop</i>
<i>going</i> <i>to</i> <i>see</i> <i>his</i> <i>movies?</i>

42
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,051
<i>Jackie Chan movies are like the turning</i>
<i>point of when a boy turns into a man.</i>

43
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,385
<i>That's a disputable line of division.</i>

44
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,422
<i>Hey, listen, those who belittle</i>
<i>Jackie will pay for his sins!</i>

45
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:29,623
<i>I will not!</i>

46
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,960
<i>Try</i> <i>jumping</i> <i>off</i> <i>a</i> <i>watchtower</i>
<i>or</i> <i>onto</i> <i>a</i> <i>chandelier!</i>

47
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,594
<i>I wouldn't even if I could!</i>

48
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,230
<i>And</i> <i>why</i> <i>are</i> <i>you</i> <i>so</i> <i>hooked</i>
<i>on</i> <i>Jackie</i> <i>Chan</i> <i>today?</i>

49
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,833
<i>Are</i> <i>you</i> <i>a</i> <i>resident</i> <i>of</i>
<i>Jackie</i> <i>Village</i> <i>or something?</i>

50
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,902
<i>Alright,</i> <i>has</i> <i>it</i> <i>been</i> <i>five</i> <i>minutes,</i> <i>yet?</i>

51
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,604
<i>Nope,</i> <i>only</i> <i>one</i> <i>minute</i> <i>and</i>
<i>fifty</i> <i>seconds.</i>

52
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:45,939
<i>There's still lots more time.</i>

53
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,007
<i>Don't you think...</i>

54
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,143
<i>maybe</i> <i>if</i> <i>we</i> <i>keep</i> <i>doing</i> <i>this,</i>
<i>the</i> <i>producers</i> <i>will</i> <i>get</i> <i>angry</i> <i>at us?</i>

55
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,145
<i>The producers?</i>
<i>Like who?</i>

56
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,613
<i>Well, I mean like...</i>

57
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,316
<i>Someone</i> <i>watching</i> <i>this</i>
<i>or</i> <i>being</i> <i>shown</i> <i>this...</i>

58
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,751
<i>or being made to listen to this.</i>

59
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:58,518
<i>People like that.</i>

60
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,153
<i>Man, what a pain.</i>

61
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,122
<i>I</i> <i>guess</i> <i>we</i> <i>have</i> <i>no</i> <i>choice,</i>
<i>let's</i> <i>start</i> <i>it</i> <i>up!</i>

62
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:30,777
<i>Hey, what's this?</i>

63
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,112
<i>Are we still on this cut?</i>

64
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,480
<i>Let's start then.</i>

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,084
<i>The "Gin Tama celebrating</i>
<i>six month anniversary" Special!</i>

66
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,385
<i>The "This happened,</i>
<i>that happened,</i>

67
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,587
<i>all the things that happened"</i>
<i>highlight special!</i>

68
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,888
<i>Enjoy!</i>

69
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,498
Hey, guys, this is supposed
to be a highlight special.

70
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:52,966
We're supposed to be looking back.

71
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,434
Somebody look back, would you?

72
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,837
Nope. Somebody needs
to watch the pot, you know.

73
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:00,440
So I'll watch it, and you two can
look back all you want, okay?

74
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,443
No way, I'll watch the pot,
Shinpachi, just start us off.

75
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,078
You were made for this kind of thing!

76
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,513
Have some confidence in yourself.

77
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,282
I really don't like backhanded
compliments like that.

78
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,650
Kagura, why don't you go, huh?

79
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,685
No way!

80
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,721
I know you guys are gonna try to eat
all the beef while I look away.

81
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:22,295
Sheesh, why don't you give us a
freaking break, Kagura, will you?

82
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,699
You really think we'd do
something that desperate?

83
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:26,500
Hah.

84
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,368
This is supposed
to be a happy occasion.

85
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,271
Could you not say such
hurtful things right now?

86
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,108
Sure, we practically never ever
get to eat hotpots.

87
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,810
But this is a special occasion...

88
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,545
and we're here to celebrate
all of us together,

89
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,581
and you really had to say such
an awful thing at a time like this?

90
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,250
This is awful.

91
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,019
Yeah, I can say that this is really
depressing me, Kagura.

92
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,021
That was a pretty mean thing to say,
Kagura.

93
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,456
You should apologize.

94
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,690
Mmmmm...

95
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,560
Okay, damn it.

96
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,829
I'm sorry for being such a hobo.

97
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,596
This is our chance!

98
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,733
Go now!

99
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:15,916
Oh man, it looks like the precious
beef has totally disintegrated.

100
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,250
Look at that.

101
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,352
You guys pulled on it way too hard.

102
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,389
Don't you think you're a bit
too excited over just a hotpot?

103
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,224
Damn it, you guys!

104
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,525
You both tricked me!

105
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,894
Honestly, I'm starting to
lose faith in humanity,

106
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,930
and it's all because of you guys!

107
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,732
That's how people grow up
to become adults, Kagura.

108
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:33,900
Good for you kiddo!

109
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,669
You're one step closer
to becoming an adult.

110
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,805
Besides, didn't I teach you that the
dinner table is a battlefield?

111
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,373
Have you forgotten that already?

112
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,510
I'll never believe anything
Gin says ever again!

113
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,644
You're all my enemies!

114
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,246
I won't trust anyone ever again.

115
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,081
Yes, that's a good mentality to have.

116
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,416
Hate me more.
Detest me!

117
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,450
And despise me!

118
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,386
Use the power of that hatred
and let it flow through you,

119
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,722
to make it through this
rotten world we live in.

120
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,391
The only thing rotten in this world
is your head!

121
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,993
<i>This is bad.</i>

122
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,862
<i>It's just as I feared.</i>

123
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,931
<i>Having a hotpot dinner</i>
<i>here at Odd Jobs right now,</i>

124
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,801
<i>is like throwing Noel Marshall</i>
<i>into a den of lions.</i>

125
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,171
<i>At this rate, all the beef</i>
<i>will be torn into shreds</i>

126
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,706
<i>before it even hits our tongues.</i>

127
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,710
<i>Rather than thinking about how to</i>
<i>eat more beef then anyone else,</i>

128
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,670
<i>I should be thinking about</i>
<i>protecting it from those greedy two.</i>

129
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,549
<i>But they're like a bunch</i>
<i>of feral cats right now.</i>

130
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,218
<i>If I end up provoking them,</i>
<i>it'll backfire.</i>

131
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:26,753
<i>No.</i>

132
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,656
<i>They're both stupid,</i>
<i>but their pride is first class.</i>

133
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,524
<i>So if I target that.</i>

134
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,995
<i>It's a huge risk, but this is the</i>
<i>only way to protect the beef!</i>

135
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,532
You guuys, I think I'm out.

136
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,336
I don't want to eat this if we
have to fight over it.

137
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,904
This is just pathetic.

138
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,607
I actually had barbeque
with my sister yesterday.

139
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,142
I'm kind of sick of beef...

140
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,112
especially since I can
have it anytime I want.

141
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,546
You two can continue to go at it.

142
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,915
I mean, if you guys still really want it.

143
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,153
Come!

144
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,254
Come on!

145
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,555
Bring it on!

146
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,062
Oh, well then.

147
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,898
It's not like I really wanted
to eat beef today,

148
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,767
we just happened to come
into some money.

149
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,802
So I thought we'd splurge and
have a hot pot for dinner,

150
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,400
but if it's gonna be like this
I guess we'll have to call it quits.

151
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,073
You guys really alright with that?

152
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,542
Yeah, that's totally fine with me!

153
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,845
I'm not particularly eager to eat
beef for dinner, either.

154
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,247
I'm a vegetarian, after all!

155
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,683
Let's just stop this crap then,
forget the hotpot!

156
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,085
I can't be bothered
with this, damn it!

157
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,019
<i>Yes!</i>

158
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,722
<i>But I think my act was more</i>
<i>effective than I anticipated.</i>

159
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,258
<i>It feels like this might just</i>
<i>end right here.</i>

160
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,860
<i>Damn it.</i>

161
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,996
<i>I'm</i> <i>the</i> <i>one</i> <i>that</i> <i>started</i>
<i>saying</i> <i>such</i> <i>a</i> <i>thing,</i>

162
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,832
<i>so I can't backtrack and suggest</i>
<i>we heat up the pot again.</i>

163
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,200
<i>And besides...</i>

164
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,535
<i>it would be embarrassing.</i>

165
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,936
<i>This is bad.</i>

166
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,771
<i>I wanted to neutralize</i>
<i>the situation,</i>

167
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,740
<i>so I followed along</i>
<i>with Shinpachi...</i>

168
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,942
<i>but I didn't expect</i>
<i>Kagura to agree.</i>

169
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,778
<i>It's going to take a miracle</i>
<i>to start up the hotpot dinner</i>

170
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,246
<i>again in this situation.</i>

171
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:01,948
<i>However, if I don't do anything,</i>

172
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,050
<i>there won't be a</i>
<i>hotpot dinner for sure.</i>

173
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,720
<i>And we haven't</i>
<i>even gotten started.</i>

174
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,687
<i>No way!</i>

175
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,289
<i>I must avoid that at all costs.</i>

176
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,724
<i>Someone, make a move.</i>

177
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,125
<i>I want to eat beef.</i>

178
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,526
<i>I'm craving it so badly.</i>

179
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,028
<i>I want to stuff myself with it!</i>

180
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:15,895
<i>Come on, Shinpachi!</i>

181
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:16,996
<i>Say something.</i>
<i>Please!</i>

182
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,832
<i>I'll even give you 2 bucks, Shinpachi!</i>

183
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,567
<i>Come on, someone!</i>

184
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,668
<i>Say something!</i>

185
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,802
<i>I want to eat beef!</i>

186
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,472
<i>I haven't actually eaten any beef</i>
<i>for nearly six months!</i>

187
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,506
<i>We're all the same!</i>

188
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,075
<i>We're all one at heart,</i>
<i>aren't we?</i> Aren't we?

189
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,010
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

190
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,446
What?
What's that?

191
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,582
Hey, Kagura, what's up?

192
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,050
You aren't hungry, are you?

193
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,852
No, I'm not hungry.
That was a fart.

194
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,887
No way, that wasn't a fart.

195
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,820
That was your stomach growling.
I'm sure of it.

196
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,824
So what?
Are you that hungry or what?

197
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,825
I'm not hungry at all.

198
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,860
I'm feeling full.

199
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,963
Look, I think if you're really that
hungry, let's all have some hotpot?

200
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,865
It doesn't matter to me,
but what do you wanna do?

201
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,733
I'm okay either way, but Kagura...

202
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,069
you don't need to hold back
if you're hungry.

203
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,238
That's right.
I honestly don't care either way...

204
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,106
but it's right in front of us.

205
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,841
Yeah, I don't care either way,

206
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,643
but it would be wasteful to leave it,

207
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,978
as far as I'm concerned.

208
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,179
I'm hungry, but it's okay.

209
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,747
I have my pickled seaweed.

210
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,983
‐You idiot!
‐You idiot!

211
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,100
What did you think was going to happen
when a growing child keeps eating

212
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,788
junk like that without
eating proper food?

213
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:18,420
Do you not have
any sympathy}
for all of the farmers and all of the cows?

214
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,726
Hm?

215
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,794
C'mon.

216
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,162
I'll serve you some of it.

217
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,665
You sure?

218
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,833
I'm sure.

219
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,501
I said I bought it for
you guys didn't I?

220
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,170
Hurry and eat kid, or I will kill you!

221
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,748
Oh well, then I guess
we'll eat too, all right?

222
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,417
Not that I'm especially hungry.

223
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:45,585
What a bother.

224
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,154
But if I don't join you,
I'll spoil the mood.

225
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,089
Shinpachi, you ready to eat?

226
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,291
Oh, okay.

227
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,293
Not that I'm craving beef
much either.

228
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,729
But I've been taught that it's
wasteful to leave food uneaten.

229
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,865
I'm vigilant when it comes
to things like this.

230
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,467
<i>Phew...</i>

231
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,068
<i>got past that hurdle.</i>

232
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,804
<i>But it's definitely going</i>
<i>to be much harder</i>

233
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,539
<i>than before to reach for some beef.</i>

234
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,009
<i>After refusing the hot pot already...</i>

235
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,213
<i>there's</i> <i>an</i> <i>undeniable</i> <i>air</i> <i>of</i>
<i>hesitation</i> <i>among</i> <i>us</i> <i>now.</i>

236
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,417
<i>Come</i> <i>on,</i> <i>isn't</i> <i>there</i> <i>something</i>
<i>to</i> <i>break</i> <i>this</i> <i>tension?</i>

237
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,618
<i>Isn't there...</i>

238
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,719
<i>something?</i>

239
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,323
<i>‐Isn't there...</i>
<i>‐Isn't there...</i>

240
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,757
<i>‐something?!</i>
<i>‐something?!</i>

241
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,479
Elizabeth, that was a very close call.

242
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,017
What're you guys doing here?!

243
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,121
We ran into some
unforeseen circumstances.

244
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,890
Oh yeah?
Is that right?

245
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,291
Big liar!

246
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,325
Egg‐scuse me,

247
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,829
but I'm going to need you to lettuce
hide here for a beef moment.

248
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,697
Then I promise we'll
be onion our way.

249
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,432
<i>What is this person saying?!</i>

250
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,337
At it again, eh, Cobra?

251
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,006
My name is Katsura, not Cobra.

252
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,175
It's so obvious his story
is a big fat lie!

253
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,744
But his entrance has blown
the situation out of the water.

254
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,379
Even if we question his motives..

255
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,180
Oh look, you figured me out?

256
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,410
He's prepared to charm his way out.
I've gotta get him out of here.

257
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,951
He's definitely thought this through.

258
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,553
Oh please, oh please.

259
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,655
Let's all enjoy this
delicious food together.

260
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,089
Wh‐What's that?

261
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,958
What is this pretty boy thinking?

262
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,794
Trying to act all nice
and sweet, is he?

263
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,830
Sweeter than eating pop tarts
with apple sauce.

264
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,632
Hey, that sounds really good.

265
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,234
I think I'll try it next time.

266
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,602
But more importantly...!

267
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:44,938
Thank you so much.

268
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,141
The aura of hesitation
that our war of words

269
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,677
created has dissipated
thanks to their entrance.

270
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,312
So now.

271
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,214
The challenge is who
will go on the offensive

272
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,651
in this quiet calm and grab the
first piece of beef for himself!

273
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,688
The one prepared to own up
to the titles, "petty and greedy"...

274
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:04,123
and the one who is able
to take the first bite...

275
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,658
regardless of the others before him,

276
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,595
will have the right to control the
pot and all the beef inside it.

277
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,763
And the right to the title of.

278
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,366
‐The Hotpot Shogun!
‐The Hotpot Shogun!

279
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,869
<i>Well, here goes the first strategy!</i>

280
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,439
<i>The one who takes command wins!</i>

281
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,640
<i>At this point...</i>

282
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,676
<i>the one closest to being the</i>
<i>Hotpot Shogun is Kagura, of course.</i>

283
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,646
<i>Although she hasn't actually</i>
<i>touched the pot yet.</i>

284
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,915
<i>But once she finishes eating</i>
<i>what's in her bowl,</i>

285
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,618
<i>she has the power right now</i>
<i>to reach for her next serving.</i>

286
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,487
<i>However, there's no need</i>
<i>to worry about her.</i>

287
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:38,057
<i>From her face, it's obvious that she's</i>
<i>relishing the taste of the vegetables.</i>

288
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,659
<i>Among girls her age...</i>

289
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,495
<i>there are many fools who think</i>
<i>that eating vegetables</i>

290
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,365
<i>is way cooler than eating</i>
<i>high‐caloric meat.</i>

291
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,533
<i>And these other two.</i>

292
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,202
<i>They're not too dangerous.</i>

293
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,938
<i>That's because both of</i>
<i>them are here as guests.</i>

294
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,675
<i>In their position, the chance that they'll</i>
<i>make a move for the pot first is zero.</i>

295
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,477
<i>After urging them several times,</i>

296
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,012
<i>they might finally take</i>
<i>some cabbage or</i>

297
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,680
<i>something unimportant to eat.</i>

298
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,083
<i>Nope, one can't underestimate Cobra.</i>

299
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,019
<i>My name is Katsura, not Cobra.</i>

300
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:10,089
<i>There's a very high possibility that he'll</i>
<i>ignore this high‐charged atmosphere</i>

301
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,025
<i>and go right into the pot</i>
<i>with his chopsticks.</i>

302
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,793
<i>I guess we can ignore</i>
<i>that weird‐looking beast.</i>

303
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,396
<i>No way can he use chopsticks</i>
<i>with those hands.</i>

304
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,830
<i>Holy crap!</i>
<i>He is dexterous!</i>

305
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,366
<i>The biggest problem is still</i>
<i>with Shinpachi, though.</i>

306
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,603
<i>He quickly figured out a young girl's</i>
<i>tastes and preferences,</i>

307
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,272
<i>and subtly plated a huge</i>
<i>serving of vegetable for her.</i>

308
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,608
<i>No doubt, that guy is shrewd.</i>

309
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,209
<i>Darn</i> <i>it!</i>

310
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:33,146
<i>Why didn't I offer a bowl of</i>
<i>vegetables to Gin after Kagura?</i>

311
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,582
<i>I take on the role of</i>
<i>the generous friend,</i>

312
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,785
<i>and then take a serving</i>
<i>last for myself.</i>

313
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,688
<i>And in the process, if I had changed</i>
<i>the layout of the food in the pot,</i>

314
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,157
<i>or given myself the opportunity to</i>
<i>reach into the pot more often...</i>

315
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,392
<i>the title of the Hotpot Shogun</i>
<i>would have been mine!</i>

316
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,027
<i>Wait!</i>

317
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,662
<i>Kagura is almost done eating.</i>

318
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,365
<i>How about if I offer to</i>
<i>fill her bowl again?</i>

319
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,333
<i>No, damn it!</i>

320
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,035
<i>I won't have a second chance.</i>

321
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,806
<i>That's because she's sure to</i>
<i>want to do it herself this time.</i>

322
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,308
<i>She won't take kindly</i>
<i>to someone's offer.</i>

323
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,812
<i>Well then, this is all or nothing!</i>

324
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,026
So, then, don't you guys think.

325
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,295
They say "Friendship,
persistence, victory..."

326
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:25,031
Kids these days know how
short‐lived friendship can be,

327
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,999
as well as the futility of victory.

328
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,769
So all you need is to be
a massive genius.

329
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,604
Got it!

330
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,642
Hey, isn't the heat too low
on this thing?

331
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,245
<i>The Hotpot Shogun...</i>

332
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,347
<i>is me!</i>

333
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,082
Huh?

334
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:45,418
Chopsticks?

335
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,286
<i>No way!</i>
<i>In that split second?</i>

336
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,755
<i>And Goooo!</i>

337
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:53,993
<i>Chopstick Scud Missile!</i>

338
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,931
Heh...
Huh?

339
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,835
<i>All these days of obscurity</i>
<i>were for this moment!</i>

340
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,371
<i>Damn, my sides were exposed.</i>

341
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:06,839
<i>Curse you, Cobra!</i>

342
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:18,951
<i>My name is Katsura not Cobra.</i>

343
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,188
Oh sorry, I think I might
have caught a cold.

344
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,556
Huh?!
What was that?

345
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:27,894
<i>She didn't use her hands or her</i>
<i>chopsticks, but with one sneeze.</i>

346
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,396
<i>She</i> <i>decided</i> <i>the</i> <i>outcome</i>
<i>in</i> <i>one</i> <i>move?</i>

347
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,964
<i>This strategy.</i>

348
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,476
<i>Well frankly, I don't feel like</i>
<i>eating a hotpot like that.</i>

349
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,879
<i>She's the only one who'll</i>
<i>eat the hotpot now.</i>

350
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,582
<i>Are you saying she won through</i>
<i>her innocence and purity?</i>

351
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:51,951
<i>No...</i>

352
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,286
<i>this girl!!</i>

353
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,223
<i>The title of Hotpot Shogun is mine!</i>

354
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,827
<i>She's not pure at all!</i>

355
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,229
<i>This kid has vegetable</i>
<i>coming out of her nose!</i>

356
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,331
<i>Kagura, what a frightening child!</i>

357
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,435
<i>Did you just realize it,</i>
<i>little boys?</i>

358
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,138
<i>From the moment when</i>
<i>I made my stomach growl,</i>

359
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,573
<i>to the moment I was concentrating</i>

360
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,041
<i>on eating my bowl of vegetables.</i>

361
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,375
<i>It was all an act,</i>

362
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,545
<i>a mere ruse to put all</i>
<i>of you greenhorns off guard...</i>

363
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,781
and take the seat of
the Hotpot Shogun.

364
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,184
Well, you can suck it up and
watch as this little girl terrorizes

365
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,620
all of your beloved beef!

366
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,925
<i>No way!</i>

367
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,228
She's swallowing it in one gulp!

368
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,797
People of the Yato Clan must have
monstrous bellies!

369
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,236
Good evening!

370
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:44,604
Say, what's all this?

371
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,539
Don't tell me you've
all started already?

372
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,207
Did you forget about us?

373
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,976
I thought I told you to wait
until we got here

374
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,444
before you started cooking.

375
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,914
As if any of these guys know
what patience is, Ms. Otose.

376
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,583
<i>Too bad, old biddies.</i>

377
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,852
<i>The beef you came to eat is all...</i>

378
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:03,022
Hey, what's this meat
you've been using?

379
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,958
Don't tell me you're having
pork in your hotpot?

380
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,660
Come on!

381
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:08,694
Isn't this a party?

382
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,996
How pitiful.

383
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,298
Pork is just perfect
for these guys.

384
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,735
<i>Pork?</i>

385
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,272
<i>Th‐That's ridiculous!</i>

386
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,307
<i>Pork?</i>
<i>Impossible!</i>

387
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,775
<i>It definitely tasted like beef.</i>

388
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,510
<i>The flavor of beef...</i>

389
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,113
<i>like a cheese burger,</i>
<i>breakfast cheese burger,</i>

390
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:30,249
<i>and double bacon cheese burger,</i>
<i>the kind I eat sometimes.</i>

391
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,817
<i>She's right!</i>

392
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,720
<i>It was the same scent as that</i>
<i>aroma that wafts through the air</i>

393
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,123
<i>for a brief moment when I</i>
<i>walk by that burger shop.</i>

394
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,693
<i>Well, I've never actually had any before,</i>
<i>but I know it was beef!</i>

395
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:41,794
<i>Move aside.</i>

396
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,329
<i>This is my seat, of course.</i>

397
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,664
<i>Geez, fine.</i>

398
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,168
<i>No way!</i>

399
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:50,836
<i>Yes, way!</i>

400
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:54,874
<i>All that meat you've been eating,</i>
<i>believing it to be beef, was actually...</i>

401
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,010
<i>‐Cheap cuts of pork!</i>
<i>‐Cheap cuts of pork!</i>

402
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,282
<i>Did you really think an</i>
<i>expensive delicacy...</i>

403
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,086
<i>a food like beef would really be</i>
<i>sitting on our tables, little girl?</i>

404
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,089
<i>As if I'd share it even if I had some.</i>

405
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:11,657
<i>Th‐That's not...</i>

406
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,726
<i>So everything</i>
<i>I believed was a lie.</i>

407
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,896
<i>All characters appearing are fictious,</i>

408
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,931
<i>and any resemblance</i>
<i>to real persons,</i>

409
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,467
<i>living or dead,</i>
<i>is purely coincidental?</i>

410
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,005
<i>At that moment.</i>

411
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,342
<i>I felt an insecurity, like my legs</i>
<i>were crumbling underneath me.</i>

412
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:33,512
<i>I won't trust anyone anymore,</i>
<i>I can't trust anyone!</i>

413
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,047
<i>Oh Pork, oh Pork!</i>

414
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,682
<i>Wherefore art thou Pork?</i>

415
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,686
<i>I really hope you all break</i>
<i>the bone in your little toe!</i>

416
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,736
<i>Victory.</i>
<i>One down.</i>

417
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,205
<i>Cobra is sure tough to take down.</i>

418
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,440
<i>My name is Katsura, not Cobra.</i>

419
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,576
<i>And as if I'd die over</i>
<i>a wound like this!</i>

420
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,444
<i>I still haven't accomplished</i>
<i>anything in life!</i>

421
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,750
You gotta eat something good
at least once in a while.

422
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,919
I splurged a little bit and I've got
the expensive cuts today.

423
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,355
And now let's eat some good food,

424
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,390
drink some good drinks,

425
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,891
and celebrate with a
good meal!

426
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,928
Oh! Mt. Fuji!
Geisha!

427
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,397
Oh, wasabi!

428
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,599
<i>All right, it's almost ready to eat.</i>

429
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,434
<i>This is it.</i>

430
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,736
<i>An</i> <i>old</i> <i>hag</i> <i>with</i> <i>one</i> <i>foot</i>
<i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>grave...</i>

431
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,039
<i>and</i> <i>a</i> <i>middle‐aged</i> <i>broad</i>
<i>with</i> <i>one</i> <i>foot</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>mud.</i>

432
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,674
<i>A man who's middle name</i>
<i>is "flat broke,"</i>

433
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,344
<i>and an organism who's</i>
<i>middle name is a "mystery."</i>

434
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,379
<i>‐Easy foes!</i>
<i>‐Easy foes!</i>

435
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,114
<i>He's the problem.</i>

436
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,217
<i>Hey, Gin, let's settle this like men.</i>

437
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,787
Otose, may I serve you?

438
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,555
<i>I made the first move!</i>

439
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,256
<i>That guy!</i>

440
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,624
<i>He's using the same strategy!</i>

441
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,827
<i>This</i> <i>time,</i> <i>I'll</i> <i>become</i> <i>the</i>
<i>Hotpot</i> <i>shogun</i> <i>for</i> <i>sure!</i>

442
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,363
Oh, don't you worry about us.

443
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,331
Let's just all serve ourselves.

444
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,367
<i>Shucks!</i>
<i>I didn't see that coming!</i>

445
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,602
<i>Now everyone will indiscriminately reach</i>

446
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,438
<i>into the hotpot for all the good stuff!</i>

447
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,039
<i>Heh, it backfired.</i>

448
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,408
<i>He was so caught up in his</i>
<i>thoughtfulness strategy.</i>

449
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,178
<i>That he was blind to the possibility</i>
<i>of a counter to it!</i>

450
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,447
<i>You</i> <i>can</i> <i>blame</i> <i>your</i>
<i>own</i> <i>youth</i> <i>for</i> <i>that!</i>

451
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,585
<i>It is true, I admit I failed, sure.</i>

452
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,954
<i>But I won't concede defeat just yet!</i>

453
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,355
<i>That's true.</i>

454
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,324
<i>No need to overthink this anymore.</i>

455
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,293
<i>I agree.</i>

456
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,729
<i>Real men don't turn their</i>
<i>backs when there's a fight.</i>

457
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,600
<i>Considering</i> <i>the</i> <i>amount</i>
<i>of</i> <i>time</i> <i>we</i> <i>have</i> <i>left,</i>

458
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,036
<i>we</i> <i>have</i> <i>no</i> <i>other</i> <i>option</i> <i>but</i>
<i>to</i> go all in once right now!

459
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,305
<i>The one who reaches</i>
<i>the pot first wins!</i>

460
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,440
<i>‐The Hotpot Shogun...</i>
<i>‐The Hotpot Shogun...</i>

461
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,475
<i>‐is me!</i>
<i>‐is me!</i>

462
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,542
<i>is me!</i>

463
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,713
<i>Wh‐what?</i>
<i>What's that?</i>

464
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,156
What is it?

465
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,725
<i>R‐Ridiculous!</i>

466
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,394
<i>How could this...?</i>

467
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,934
<i>Forget the beef...</i>

468
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,137
<i>I can't even get close...</i>

469
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:12,838
<i>to the pot!</i>

470
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,176
<i>However, there's no way...</i>

471
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,744
<i>‐we will lose!</i>
<i>‐we will lose!</i>

472
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,785
<i>They're beyond the realm</i>
<i>of Hotpot Shogun.</i>

473
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:27,887
<i>‐They are.</i>
<i>‐They are.</i>

474
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,255
<i>‐Hotpot.</i>
<i>‐Hotpot.</i>

475
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,657
<i>Emperors!</i>

476
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,060
<i>Th‐They're just in a different</i>
<i>class from us!</i>

477
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:36,428
<i>The pot is so far.</i>

478
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,596
<i>I can't reach it!</i>

479
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,890
<i>Why'd they even come here?</i><i>Just to torment us?</i>

480
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,734
<i>What were we fighting for until now?</i>

481
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,537
<i>We were like frogs in a well,</i>

482
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,405
<i>fighting and hurting each other.</i>

483
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,508
<i>Was all that suffering meaningless?</i>

484
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,945
<i>‐No...!</i>
<i>‐No...!</i>

485
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,017
‐What's this?
‐What's all this?

486
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,487
And this is why...!

487
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,522
We can't let our fighting be in vain!

488
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,257
This is why, we can't...

489
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,860
‐lose this battle!
‐lose this battle!

490
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,530
Absultely no way!

491
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,199
Go, Kagura!

492
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,567
You must become...

493
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,435
‐Napotleon!
‐Napotleon!

494
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,185
It smells kind of sour and
it doesn't taste that good.

495
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,753
I think I prefer pork.

496
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:39,758
Why you!

497
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,460
<i>Why you!</i>
<i>Are you screwing with us?</i>

498
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,728
<i>‐Seriously?</i>
<i>‐Spit it out!</i>

499
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:45,130
<i>‐Spit it all out, Kagura!</i>
<i>‐Oh my goodness</i>...

500
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,502
<i>Humans are so worthless.</i>

501
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:22,628
<i>Tucker?</i>

502
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,930
<i>You're</i> <i>Tucker,</i> <i>my</i> <i>classmate</i>
<i>from</i> <i>school,</i> <i>aren't</i> <i>you?</i>

503
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:27,099
<i>Why'd</i> <i>you</i> <i>end</i> <i>up</i> <i>joining</i>
<i>a</i> <i>bike</i> <i>gang?</i>

504
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,100
<i>If only...</i>

505
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,202
<i>If</i> <i>only</i> <i>I</i> <i>had</i> <i>rescued</i>
<i>you</i> <i>back</i> <i>then!</i>

506
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:31,937
<i>The next episode...</i>
