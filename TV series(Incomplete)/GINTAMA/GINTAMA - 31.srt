1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:05,205
Keep the room well‐lit and
watch from a distance, okay?

2
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,598
Man, I totally vowed I would graduate
from comic books just recently,

3
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,233
so why am I even doing this?

4
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,235
Weekly serials are all about the hooks.

5
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,905
Once they catch you, then you have
to know what happens next,

6
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,307
and if you miss just a single issue,
then you totally lose

7
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,110
track of what's going on,
and that's how they get you...

8
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,811
No!

9
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,579
That's exactly why I should stop.

10
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,715
What hell of a vice.

11
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,483
Weekly comi‐hm?

12
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,025
<i>Huh?</i>

13
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,426
<i>What is this?</i>

14
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,861
<i>The sky is all red.</i>

15
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,064
<i>Wait.</i>

16
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,899
<i>Is it me that's all red?</i>

17
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,069
<i>Wait.</i>

18
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,106
<i>How the hell did this happen</i>
<i>in the first place?</i>

19
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,540
<i>Huh?</i>

20
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:21,908
<i>Wait a minute, I...</i>

21
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,816
Hey, guys!

22
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,251
Where is Gin?

23
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,253
Tell me now, is Gin all right?

24
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,423
Don't be shouting in a hospital,
you noisy idiot!

25
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,225
I could say the same for you, granny!

26
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,060
What about you, too, little brat?

27
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,728
And why am I shouting, too?

28
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:42,729
Hmph.

29
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,765
There's nothing to worry about.

30
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,168
He's not the type to die just
from getting hit by a car.

31
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,038
They say that he got hit when he went
out to buy his comic books...

32
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,572
I suppose that's what happens

33
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,175
when you read this stupid
crap at his age.

34
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,245
Then let's hope that he'll take this
opportunity to grow up a little bit,

35
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,980
‐right?
‐You said it.

36
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,314
You know...

37
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:05,085
Hearing you say that makes me feel
a lot better about this whole situation.

38
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,853
It was totally my bad, dude.

39
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,123
I was talking on my cell phone and I
didn't see him till it was too late.

40
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,792
‐So you're the bastard who hit him!
‐Let's see how far you can fly now!

41
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,493
‐If Gin dies, I'll whack you to death
‐Because I'm sending you to the moon!

42
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,128
with your own cell phone, you loser!
Don't you know to focus on the road!

43
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:15,996
Maybe...

44
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,364
he's not okay, after all...

45
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,065
Shut up!

46
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,534
Where do you idiots think you are?
You're in a hospital!

47
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,302
Hey, you quiet down too...

48
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,138
Hey! You can't go in there yet!

49
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,242
Alright...

50
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,944
he looks just fine to me.

51
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,813
Gin, you scared the hell out of us!

52
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,981
I'm not letting you buy
comics anymore!

53
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,250
We were very worried
about you, Gin...

54
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,653
You really hit some bad luck, huh?

55
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,888
Who are you?

56
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,224
Do I even know all of you people?

57
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,660
Do we know each other at all?

58
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:55,802
<i>‐What?!</i>
<i>‐What?!</i>

59
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,071
<i>‐He has Amnesia?!</i>
<i>‐He has Amnesia?!</i>

60
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,407
His injuries aren't
life threatening,

61
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,776
but he hit his head real hard,
and that must have made

62
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,112
some of his memories
just pop right out.

63
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,680
"Just pop right out"?!

64
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,415
What is he, a toaster or something?

65
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,616
Is that medically right?

66
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,053
It's common to lose memory of
what happened right before

67
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,554
and after an accident...

68
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:15,889
but in his case,

69
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,125
he seems to have also
forgotten his entire identity.

70
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,593
This could be quite a problem.

71
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,895
You bastard,
you'd better not be faking.

72
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,296
You're trying to get out
of paying rent

73
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,065
by pretending you have
amnesia aren't you!

74
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:25,999
Doctor...

75
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,136
I think I might be hallucinating
right now as well...

76
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,438
I keep seeing this hideous goblin.

77
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,406
Mr. Sakata, there's nothing
to worry about.

78
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,208
There are no goblins
in this hospital...

79
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,011
What you are seeing
is simply a ghost.

80
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,247
Doctor, she's alive and real.

81
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,682
The human memory
is very complex,

82
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,751
like the intertwined branches
of a tree...

83
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,487
If one branch on the tree
is disturbed,

84
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,623
the others shift and move
around as well...

85
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,494
So then, let's just see
how it goes for a while.

86
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,199
Odd Jobs Gin...

87
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,067
Is this really where I live?

88
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,802
That's right, Gin...

89
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,171
You take on odd jobs.

90
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,139
and you're kind of a
jack of all trades.

91
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,707
Jack of all trades..

92
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,009
It's no use...

93
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,377
I can't remember anything.

94
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,279
Well, you're more like
a jack of no trades

95
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,613
who did practically nothing at all.

96
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,115
We were essentially jobless.

97
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,550
Job...?

98
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,218
Jobless at my age?

99
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,354
To make matters worse, you always
look like a walking corpse,

100
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,457
and you have soulless eyes,
like the eyes of a dead fish.

101
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,593
And you never pay your rent.

102
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,662
And there was one time
when you also robbed

103
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,063
Ms. Otose of all her money...

104
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,065
‐No, that was you, you thief!
‐Ugh!

105
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:33,967
<i>If you go inside...</i>

106
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,602
<i>maybe you'll remember</i>
<i>some things...</i>

107
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,473
This is it, Gin, your home.

108
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:41,875
What do you think?

109
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,543
Doesn't it bring back
some memories?

110
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,611
That's right!

111
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,012
You always sat on this sofa,

112
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,548
picking at your boogers as you
mumble to yourself!

113
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,318
And look here, Gin!

114
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,087
It's Sadaharu.
You see?

115
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,956
It's so huge!
Seriously!

116
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,325
What did you feed him
to make him this big?

117
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:02,229
But Gin, you were always
really fond of Sadaharu.

118
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,999
Exactly how could I be fond...

119
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,535
of such an insanely
sized dog like this?

120
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,437
Oh!

121
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,172
It's gone pitch black
all of a sudden.

122
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,773
I can't see a thing!

123
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,342
Could my mind be unconsciously

124
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,611
trying to seal away my
memories in darkness?

125
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,746
No, that's not it at all.

126
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,115
You've been bitten, quite casually...

127
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,250
I think...

128
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,820
that my consciousness is
slowly fading away...

129
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:27,954
Hey, Kagura!

130
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:28,989
Look, he's bleeding!

131
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,558
He's about to lose his consciousness
on top of his memory!

132
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,859
Do something about it, quick!

133
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,903
Look, Gin, it's your,
favorite Maya Sizitzy.

134
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:44,838
That's right,

135
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,539
you would always peer
at her from a low angle

136
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,441
during her morning forecast!

137
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,176
My ass is itchy?

138
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,311
Come on, Gin.

139
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,246
Do you remember anything?

140
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,182
I don't remember anything...

141
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,218
or rather, I don't want to remember...

142
00:06:58,652 --> 00:06:59,719
Pull yourself together!

143
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,187
Be more of a loser!

144
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,723
Discard your conscience,
because that's who Gintoki is!

145
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,626
‐Is that so, I don't know?
‐That's who Gintoki is!

146
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,928
‐He's a sore, sore, sore, loser!!
‐Otose, what should we do?

147
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,768
Why don't you walk him down
the streets of Edo City?

148
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,150
His branches are spread all
throughout Edo City...

149
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,985
You might stumble across
something out there

150
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,020
that might strike a chord
in his memory.

151
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,191
What's that?
He has amnesia?

152
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:39,859
Is this true then?

153
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,228
Tell me the details of what happened,
Gintoki.

154
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,998
As I said, he lost his memories...

155
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,934
More importantly, what're
you doing here, Katsura ?

156
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,270
In order to save the country,
or even do anything..

157
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,339
the first thing you have
to have is money.

158
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:53,573
Hey, there, bro!

159
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,076
Come on inside!
We got hot chicks in here.

160
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,812
I know, Gintoki, why don't
you stop by, too.

161
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,413
We have plenty of pretty ladies...

162
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,682
You'll be able to forget
all your bad memories.

163
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:03,616
Come on!

164
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,852
Don't you think he has
forgotten enough already?!

165
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,021
Are you really even his friend?!

166
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,290
I think I feel a memory stirring!

167
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,725
Let's check it out.

168
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,593
You liar!

169
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:14,794
Whoah!

170
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,196
I felt something just now!

171
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,597
It's coming back to me...!

172
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:18,765
Is that true?

173
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:19,866
Remember, Gintoki!

174
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,402
Remember the days when you
slaved away as my apprentice!

175
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,169
Heeey!

176
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,171
Don't go changing his memory!

177
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:26,806
Where is it?

178
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,942
Where do I hit you to
jog your memory?

179
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:29,743
Is it here?

180
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:30,877
Or is it here?

181
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,412
‐No, it's probably around here.
‐No?

182
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,446
‐What about here?
‐Or here?

183
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,347
Or here!
Where?

184
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,248
Oh no, no...

185
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,250
Stop it, stop it, stop it now!

186
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,451
What's going on there?

187
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,386
Is it a fight?

188
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:40,854
Think we should jump in?

189
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,690
Hey, that's...

190
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,258
Katsura!

191
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,196
Did you get him?

192
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,631
Uh, wait...

193
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,433
There's something in our car...

194
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,503
Okita, I think we should run.

195
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,041
Hmph.

196
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,144
Stupid samurais should just stay home
and play pretend sword fighting!

197
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,278
No!

198
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,847
You're playing with us today, Katsura!

199
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:09,449
Hmph, not bad.

200
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,717
Run away, Elizabeth.

201
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,919
Come on back here!

202
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,220
‐Oh!
‐Oh!

203
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,221
Hey, Gin!

204
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,556
Hey, Gin!

205
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,024
Gin!

206
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,392
Are you okay, Gin?!

207
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,862
Who are you...

208
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,164
people?

209
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,832
Huh?

210
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,803
He has amnesia?!

211
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,439
What is that?

212
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,873
A new kind of fetish?

213
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,108
Oh no, he's...

214
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,543
oh gosh, whatever, never mind...

215
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,312
If they can hear each other,
then they can converse.

216
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,713
You're trying to punk me, right?

217
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,416
Oh yes, I can tell you're
all trying to deceive me

218
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,984
to get your kicks, aren't you?

219
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,453
So where are the cameras?

220
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,620
Where are they?

221
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,122
You've got it all wrong.

222
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,491
He actually has amnesia right now.

223
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,358
You're lying.

224
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,493
But then that means...

225
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:54,928
Yes...

226
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,230
Gin, have you really forgotten
all the humiliating things

227
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,132
we did together and all
those painful experiences

228
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,600
we both enjoyed?

229
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,437
Okay, exactly what kind of relationship
do you have with me?

230
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,872
How cruel!

231
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,007
We were on the brink
of being married!

232
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,210
You even wore formal
wedding wear!

233
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,246
Yeah, well, I'm not sure
that's exactly...

234
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,715
You only say the facts that
are convenient to you.

235
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,917
Those are the tricks
of an evil con artist.

236
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,185
Then you...

237
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,854
are really my...

238
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,123
That is right, Gin!

239
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:29,162
The truth is that I am your
love S‐L‐A‐V‐E!

240
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,666
Why're you doing this?
Why are you doing this to me?

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,869
Is this a kind of abandonment
role‐play fetish?

242
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,137
That turns me on, too,
but that's not the normal Gin!!

243
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:41,674
We've been trying to tell you
that Gin isn't his normal self.

244
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:42,842
Umm...

245
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,777
could you tell me
who is this person?

246
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,946
At this rate, you'll catch
her abnormality.

247
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,581
We should go now, Gin.

248
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,782
I won't let you leave...

249
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,352
And I won't let anyone
else have Gin either!

250
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,557
What is this stench?!

251
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,594
There was natto in that smoke
bomb for no real reason!

252
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,730
Gin is gone!

253
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,604
Okay, would you mind telling
me what this is all about?

254
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,172
It's all right, Gin.

255
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,807
Leave everything to me.

256
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,609
I won't hurt you in the slightest.

257
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,011
No, but my...

258
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,647
my grandma always said that
you can't trust the people

259
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,815
who tell you that
they won't hurt you.

260
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,284
Found him!

261
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,219
‐There he is!
‐You are not getting away!

262
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:33,927
That was too easy.

263
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,496
You won't hit me with such
a simple minded attack.

264
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,897
Ah, don't worry, Gin...

265
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:41,167
I'll teach you everything
you need to know about me.

266
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:45,038
Okay, but I just want to know
about my own memories.

267
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,906
But Gin, if you know all about me

268
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,741
then you will know all
about yourself.

269
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,843
Hey, you!

270
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,280
We should rent a small
studio apartment together...

271
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:58,217
That will be the perfect first step
of our brand new beginning...

272
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,119
And as for the children
that we will have...

273
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,622
one boy and one girl would be nice,
wouldn't it!

274
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,324
And wonderful names
for them, Sarutobi...

275
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,225
Will you stop deciding
things on your own!

276
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,162
I don't want to take my first steps
with you, you filthy skank!

277
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,399
Those words squeeze my heart
as strong as they did before!

278
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,436
I'm not going to let you have Gin!

279
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,046
Do you really think that you can
possibly stop me with that?

280
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,147
Huh...

281
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,382
Where'd Gin go...?

282
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:31,818
Gin!

283
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,553
Gin!

284
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,421
I can make it in time!

285
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,090
And I'll break his fall!

286
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:48,801
Why'd you take a full swing?!

287
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,770
I don't understand, Kagura!

288
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,740
Tear‐jerking isn't
befitting for Gintama.

289
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,908
That's no reason to "wham" him!

290
00:12:58,978 --> 00:12:59,679
Gin!

291
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,613
Gin wake up!

292
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,348
Hey, Gin, are you alive?

293
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:03,850
Hey, Gin..

294
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,084
are you okay?

295
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,656
What is...
this place?

296
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,542
My my, that's so terribly awful,
isn't it?

297
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,046
Has he also forgotten
all about me too?

298
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,514
I'm so sorry.

299
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,251
So then you do still
remember me, don't you?

300
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,987
No. He just said,
"I'm sorry," Sis.

301
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,555
Oh, of course, he remembers.

302
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,923
Don't play dumb with me.

303
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,692
You mean to say I can
remember him,

304
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,959
but he doesn't remember me?

305
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,127
Who does he think he is?

306
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,295
That sucks...

307
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:50,563
Hey, Shinpachi...

308
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,031
please hit me in the head with this

309
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,834
so that I forget only
my memories of Gin.

310
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,470
Uh, Sis, what am I,
a brain surgeon?

311
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,972
Then I have no choice...

312
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,443
I will make you remember me,
no matter what I have to do!

313
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,245
If I duplicate the shock,
I'm sure he'll remember!

314
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,480
No, Big Sis, not that!

315
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,382
You'll put us back right
where we started!

316
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,284
I'm sorry.

317
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,252
I know that I cannot
remember you yet...

318
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,355
but I promise I will soon,
so please, bear with me...

319
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,990
for just a little while longer.

320
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,459
What...?

321
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,328
Oh my, what is this?

322
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,731
Why is my heart pounding
over someone like Gin?

323
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,101
His eyes and eyebrows just look
closer together, that's all...

324
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,070
And his pupils grew just
a little bigger, that's all.

325
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,605
Uh, Big Sis?

326
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,208
We should just forget the past.

327
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,678
We should all live looking forward
rather than looking backwards.

328
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,213
What's that?

329
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,814
You changed your mind
all of a sudden?

330
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,182
What the hell just happened?!

331
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,551
You must lock away
that worthless old Gin,

332
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,487
and live your life as the
brand new Gin you are.

333
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:48,354
Hey, Sis!

334
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,423
That's like closing the toilet
lid without flushing!

335
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,091
The shit will still exist, you know!

336
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,194
What would I ever see in a man
who has dead‐fish eyes, anyway?

337
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,296
I prefer Gin the way he is now,

338
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,332
compared to that
irresponsible old Gin.

339
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:00,833
He's..

340
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,968
he's almost handsome...

341
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,036
Why the hell are you blushing?

342
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,772
You don't have a crush on him,
do you?

343
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,073
No way!
I won't allow it!

344
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,674
I absolutely refuse
to be this creep's

345
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,243
brother‐in‐law,
there's no way!

346
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,845
Shin, you are overreacting
over nothing.

347
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,514
And she's right!

348
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,616
His eyes and eyebrows may
be closer together now,

349
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,785
but when his memory
comes back, they'll separate!

350
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,887
He'll go back to having
that lazy‐ass face!

351
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,093
What the hell are you doing here?

352
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,296
Well, it was just so toasty
and warm in here...

353
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,532
And I fell asleep...

354
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,101
But look here, I bought some
Bargain Dash

355
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,969
ice cream for everybody to share.

356
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,172
It's all melted and gooey!

357
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,340
Just how long have you
been hiding under there?

358
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,075
So...

359
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,210
we meet again.

360
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,645
I haven't seen you in a while,

361
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,780
but now you've changed
quite a bit, huh?

362
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,750
Are you trying to use amnesia
to change your image...

363
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,486
and seduce my dear Otae are you?

364
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,088
Well, I'm not going to let you...

365
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,456
Look at me!

366
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,493
My eyes and eyebrows are way
closer together than yours!

367
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,429
Look at me, Otae, look at me!

368
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,966
Search all of Edo City, but you'll never
find eyes and brows closer together!

369
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,767
Nice try.

370
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:11,103
I couldn't love a stalker, even if he
had hair growing out of his eyeballs!

371
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:12,705
All right.

372
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,707
So what if I grow hair
just below my eyes?

373
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,442
‐How about that?
‐What‐What is this?

374
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,176
‐How odd...
‐How about it?

375
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,444
‐I feel...
‐You'd be a monster!

376
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,947
as though this cup is
drawing me towards it.

377
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,615
Oh!

378
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:23,916
‐It's the sugar!
‐That's right!

379
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,787
Sugary foods might jog his memory
because of his sweet tooth!

380
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,923
Eat this ice cream!

381
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,124
Hey, Sis!

382
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,326
Now listen up!

383
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,695
Gather up all the sweets in
the house immediately!

384
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,196
Huh?
How come?

385
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,898
Just get something sweet!

386
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,700
But I don't know if I have anything...

387
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,002
Gin please, come back to us!
Please, Gin!

388
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:45,838
I...

389
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,706
I... I am...

390
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,307
I am.

391
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,042
Oh, I am....

392
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,911
‐Yes, Gin!
‐Gin you...

393
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:57,984
Hey Sis...

394
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,752
what is that brown thing there?

395
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,354
It's an omelet.

396
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,489
I made it extra sweet today.

397
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,960
Yes, this omelet has quite a
unique taste, and it is certainly.

398
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,331
K‐Kondo!

399
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,766
Gin!

400
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,336
‐Who are you...people?
‐Who are you...people?

401
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,172
Oh my, that is so cute...

402
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,102
I'm so sorry.

403
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,270
You've tried everything for me,

404
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,539
but in the end,
I can't remember anything.

405
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,576
Stop apologizing, that's not like you!

406
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,644
Gin never apologizes, not ever!

407
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,246
Even if you're 90% wrong,

408
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,114
you'll use everything you have
of that last 10%

409
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,449
to make sure you don't!

410
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,384
Take your time to remember.

411
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,386
We can wait as long as we need to.

412
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,556
Let's go home for today
and get some rest, Gin.

413
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,757
That's right,

414
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,560
you might remember something
if you just relax at home.

415
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,561
What is that?!

416
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,629
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

417
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,331
That is...

418
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,332
A spaceship?

419
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,199
Oh no!

420
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,301
It looks like it is
coming straight at us!

421
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,102
Hey, Gin!

422
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,770
Hey, Gin, it's time for you
to do your thing!

423
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:25,972
Huh?

424
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,173
Yes, Gin, quickly!

425
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,608
‐What?
‐Come on, Gin.

426
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,179
Now, Gin.

427
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,714
Um, excuse me...

428
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,716
just what am I supposed to do?

429
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:37,950
Your samurai spirit!

430
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,820
Use your spirit, you always solve
conflicts with just your spirit!

431
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,188
That's right.

432
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,824
Whether it's a giant robot or a
weapon of mass destruction...

433
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,661
you, Gin, you've always slashed
your way through with this sword!

434
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,829
With this...?

435
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,667
We know you can do it,
you can definitely do it, Gin!

436
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,335
Please do it now, Gintoki!

437
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,538
I am...

438
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,175
‐Yes, Gin!
‐Yes, Gin!

439
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,148
I am...

440
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,985
Gin...

441
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,920
There is no way...

442
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,555
No human being

443
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,858
can ever accomplish such an
impossible job such as this.

444
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:54,960
Oh no!

445
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,695
Isn't that in the direction
of Odd Jobs?

446
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,634
That's quite a lot of destruction!

447
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,335
What a wreck.

448
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,371
It looks like they'll have to rebuild it.

449
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:06,872
Our.

450
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,940
Our house.

451
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,342
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

452
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,811
Sorry about that!

453
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,281
I was trying to get to a friend's
place, but I got a little lost...

454
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,416
Then I sort of ran out of fuel

455
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,052
as I was circling about,
and crashed here.

456
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:25,357
So tell me, is there an Odd Jobs Kin
around here?

457
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,626
If it's Odd Jobs Gin
you're looking for,

458
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,994
it's the place you just destroyed.

459
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,963
No way, no way, it's Kin.

460
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,498
Weren't you listening to me?

461
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,833
You're not paying attention at all.

462
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,403
Yeah, yeah, we heard you.

463
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,405
Now come with us to
the police station.

464
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,975
Oh, so then you'll show
me to Kintoki's place?

465
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,044
People in Edo City are so nice.

466
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,579
Thank you so much.

467
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,114
Wow, man!
You're obnoxious.

468
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,248
Keep quiet.

469
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,723
Now what are we gonna do?

470
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,158
We've even lost our house.

471
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:31,790
<i>Who am I...?</i>

472
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,459
<i>I don't remember at all.</i>

473
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:35,861
Hey, Gin!

474
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,229
We'll be all right.

475
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,464
We'll manage somehow.

476
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:39,798
That's right.

477
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,066
Once your memory returns,

478
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,235
I'm sure we'll
end up joking about all this.

479
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,136
For the time being,

480
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,938
we have to find
somewhere else to stay.

481
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,439
<i>Why are these two people...</i>

482
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,277
You've done enough.

483
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,878
Don't worry about me anymore...

484
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,481
You both have homes
to go back to, don't you?

485
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,516
You don't have to worry about me.

486
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,984
You're both free to go...

487
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:00,553
But, Gin?

488
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:01,654
From what I've heard,

489
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,523
I made you both work without paying
you any real salary.

490
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,058
Now that we're in this situation,

491
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,693
there's no reason for you
to stick around...

492
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:10,296
I've lost my memory and my house...

493
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,731
All the evidence that I ever
existed is gone...

494
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,635
But, this might be a really
good opportunity...

495
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,205
According to everyone's
stories about me,

496
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:20,940
I was a real mess of a guy...

497
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,476
This could be my chance to
start my life all over again...

498
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:27,713
<i>So then...</i>

499
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,149
<i>let's close down this</i>
<i>"Odd Jobs" business.</i>

500
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,553
But, you're kidding, right, Gin?

501
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,957
No, I don't need to get a salary!

502
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,526
All I need is a little pickled seaweed!

503
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:41,894
No please, Gin!

504
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:44,597
I'm sorry.

505
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,732
The Gin that the two
of you once knew...

506
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,434
isn't inside of me anymore.

507
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:50,269
Don't leave!

508
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:53,072
It'll never work, you can't
function in society!

509
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,640
‐You're an idiot!
‐No, Gin!

510
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,375
Please wait, just come back!

511
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,477
<i>Gin!</i>

512
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,546
<i>Gin!</i>

513
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:39,678
<i>Thank you, everyone for watching</i>
<i>our show and all your kind support.</i>

514
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:43,282
<i>It looks like Odd Jobs really is going</i>
<i>to close down for good this time.</i>

515
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,051
<i>Gin went off somewhere,</i>
<i>but we'll always be waiting.</i>

516
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:47,286
<i>The next episode</i>...

517
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,661
I have decided to,
well, to relive my life.
