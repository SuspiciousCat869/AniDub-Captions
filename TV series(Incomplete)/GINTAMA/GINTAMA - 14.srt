1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:03,237
This week's Gin Tama is
structured differently,

2
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:06,173
with three mini‐ stories like many
family‐friendly animations are.

3
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,434
Hey.

4
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,669
I think you've all heard
about this already.

5
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,805
but yesterday a ship that is believed
to belong to

6
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:47,307
the Harusame Space Pirates
was sunk.

7
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:52,079
And would you believe it, idiots,
the operation was apparently

8
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,580
the doing of just two samurai.

9
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,682
‐No.
‐Really?

10
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,385
Nobody's even listening,
let alone surprised.

11
00:01:58,752 --> 00:01:59,920
Hijikata!

12
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,028
Hey.

13
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,163
I think you've all heard
about this already,

14
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,499
but yesterday a ship that
is believed to belong to

15
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,935
the Harusame Space Pirates
was sunk.

16
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:19,239
And would you believe it, idiots,
the operation was apparently

17
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,341
the doing of just two samurai.

18
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,576
‐What?
‐What?

19
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,378
‐Seriously?
‐Seriously?

20
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,213
You guys are just so fake.

21
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,448
Can't you at least make
your reactions more believable?

22
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,650
Hijikata, forget it.

23
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,084
Otherwise we'll never finish.

24
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:36,356
We have reports that one of the two was
Katsura of the Exclusionist Rebels.

25
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:40,327
He is about the only guy who
could pull off a stunt like this.

26
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,897
<i>The Harusame Space Pirates</i>
<i>were smuggling massive amount</i>

27
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,899
<i>of illicit drugs into Edo City.</i>

28
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,935
<i>I understand how they couldn't forgive</i>
<i>the space pirates</i>

29
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,304
<i>whether they're exclusionists or not.</i>

30
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,707
But the real problem starts here,

31
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:57,577
Rumor has it that Government Shogunate
officer was involved in the drug ring.

32
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:01,882
In return for his assistance in facilitating
the smooth transport of the goods

33
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:05,686
this officer was taking a handsome
cut of the drug sale's profits.

34
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,021
The authenticity of this information
is uncertain,

35
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,491
but the exclusionist forces scattered
throughout Edo City have picked up

36
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,360
on these rumors and they're
planning assassinations

37
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,095
to take out any
rotten apples.

38
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,164
That is where we come in!

39
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,705
You bastard!

40
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,442
How do you manage to have
a condescending face

41
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,609
even when you're sleeping.

42
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,678
Hey!
Wake up, ass hat!

43
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:35,082
What kind of idiot goes to sleep
while on guard duty?

44
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,716
Give me a break, Mom.

45
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,518
Did you forget today's Sunday?

46
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,387
You're such a goofball,
you know that!

47
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,788
Today is Tuesday!

48
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,025
You nitwit, what will you do if the
exclusionist forces stormed this place

49
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,126
while you were sleeping!

50
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,894
Stop treating your work like a joke!

51
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,263
When have I ever treated work
like a joke?

52
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,866
The only thing I think is a joke
is you, Hijikata!

53
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,368
Oh it's so on, draw your sword
right now!

54
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,506
Stop goofing off
while you're on duty!

55
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,774
What do you think this is?

56
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,175
A primary school excursion?

57
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,244
Are you about to start a
pillow fight, little girls?

58
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,914
Would you just shut the hell up!

59
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,283
I'm already irritated enough as it is!

60
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,018
Yeah.
We're very sorry, sir.

61
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,055
Good grief, you apes are
so incompetent.

62
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,357
What is with that guy?

63
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,127
After all, we're all putting our own
lives on the line to guard him!

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,395
You were asleep, idiot.

65
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,265
Look, he may be some big shot
Government official

66
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,401
but why should we have to be the ones
responsible to protect that toad?

67
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,905
Okita, we are pledged, body and soul,
to this Government.

68
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,441
The Shogunate is the very reason
we exist.

69
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:38,778
It is a samurai's cherished ambition
to repay a debt with loyalty!

70
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,215
The swords of the Shinsengumi exist
to protect the Shogun Government!

71
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,285
But these are the guys suspected
to be colluding with the pirates.

72
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,254
I can't share your enthusiasm.

73
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:48,688
Don't you agree, Hijikata?

74
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,724
I'm always enthusiastic, Okita.

75
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,459
Look at everyone.

76
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,728
They've all lost interest in their work.

77
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,664
I mean, check out Yamazaki,
he's playing freakin' badminton!

78
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:01,168
Yamazaki!
What the hell do you think you're doing?

79
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:06,406
Look, Okita you've got to stop
overthinking everything, okay?

80
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,545
If the life of a person in front of you is in
danger whether he's a good guy or not,

81
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,013
you gotta give him a hand.

82
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,283
That's the way all people
should live their lives.

83
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,453
Hey!
Just a minute!

84
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:24,457
Don't you dare walk off on your own,
I mean please!

85
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,692
Wait up!

86
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,695
Kondo is really too kind
for his own good.

87
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,598
Hold on, Kinya!
I'm telling you, it's too dangerous!

88
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:32,632
Enough of this!

89
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,768
I'm sick of being cooped up
in this place with you!

90
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,570
Your life is in danger, Kinya.

91
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,737
Do you understand that?

92
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,573
What difference does it make
where I am

93
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,075
when apes like you are
the ones guarding me!

94
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,812
We may be apes but we are apes

95
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,114
who are equipped with an
unwavering warrior code!

96
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,649
Don't underestimate us!

97
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:50,784
What are you talking about?

98
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,086
You're nothing but a country
bumpkin samurai!

99
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,488
Ribbit!
Curse you, Daraku!

100
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,825
This would never have happened
if he hadn't screwed this all up.

101
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,993
Daraku who?

102
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,664
Look out!

103
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,834
Chief!

104
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:11,571
‐Yamazaki!
‐On it!

105
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:12,606
Kondo!
Hang on!

106
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,374
Are you okay?
So, we're going to get a doctor.

107
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,644
Looks like even an ape
can be useful as a shield.

108
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,250
Calm down, Okita.

109
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,352
Your brows are as furrowed
as Bruce Wayne's.

110
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,707
The sniper was a member
to the Exclusionist Rebels

111
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,142
known as the "Back to
the Stars Faction."

112
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:53,546
They're separate from Katsura's group,
but they're no less radical in their beliefs.

113
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:54,547
I see.

114
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,850
Everything that happened
today is on me.

115
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,485
I handled everything,
from the chain of command

116
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,954
to the positioning of
our officers, poorly.

117
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,390
We'll have to redouble our efforts.

118
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,958
But Vice‐chief!

119
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:09,329
You saw how that toad treated all of us,
and you still want to protect his life?

120
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,232
That bastard believes that humans
are nothing but trash.

121
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,069
He didn't even feel the slightest remorse
for Kondo who took the bullet for him.

122
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,607
Look, Vice‐chief, I know you didn't order
it, but I took a look around the villa.

123
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,676
A stash of these turned up
in the warehouse.

124
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,812
Without a doubt,
that toad is guilty.

125
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,081
To be protecting a guy like this.

126
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,517
What on earth has the Shogunate
come to then?

127
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:31,651
Can you tell me that, sir.

128
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,386
A bit late for that.

129
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,224
The Government of today doesn't exist
to serve the good of mankind.

130
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,161
We've known that for
a long time already.

131
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,064
So what do you wield
your sword for?

132
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,166
Is it to protect the Government?

133
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,101
Is it to protect the Shogun?

134
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:49,936
That's not it for me.

135
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,273
Do you remember...

136
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:57,043
<i>how</i> <i>it</i> <i>used</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>those</i> <i>days</i>
<i>when</i> <i>we</i> <i>were</i> <i>just</i> <i>a</i> <i>bunch</i> <i>of</i> <i>thugs</i>

137
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:00,914
<i>with no education, knowing only</i>
<i>how to swing a sword?</i>

138
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:04,050
<i>Who</i> <i>was</i> <i>it</i> <i>that</i> <i>welcomed</i> <i>us</i>
<i>into</i> <i>that</i> <i>stinking</i> <i>old</i> <i>dojo</i>

139
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,618
<i>and refused to forsake us.</i>

140
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,456
<i>Even</i> <i>after</i> <i>the</i> <i>order</i> <i>to</i> <i>outlaw</i> <i>swords</i>
<i>was</i> <i>issued</i> <i>by</i> <i>the</i> <i>government?</i>

141
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,892
<i>And</i> <i>then,</i> <i>when</i> <i>we</i> <i>lost</i> <i>our</i> <i>dojo</i> <i>and</i>
<i>we</i> <i>were</i> <i>stripped</i> <i>of</i> <i>our</i> <i>swords...</i>

142
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,162
<i>who</i> <i>was</i> <i>it</i> <i>who</i> <i>managed</i> <i>to</i> <i>get</i> <i>us</i>
<i>back</i> <i>our</i> <i>swords?</i>

143
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:19,332
It wasn't the Government,
nor was it the Shogun.

144
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,969
There's only one man I answer to,
to this day.

145
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,406
Our boss says to protect this frog toad,
and that's it.

146
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:29,175
I'll follow my orders, no matter
who or what they are.

147
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,113
If you don't like that, then leave.
I won't stop you.

148
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,259
What the hell are you doing?
Hey!

149
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,027
Don't worry, calm down.

150
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,162
I mean, he isn't dead.

151
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,031
We just have to keep him alive right?

152
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,733
We'll bait the enemy with him,
and then wipe them out.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,001
The best defense is a strong offense.

154
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,871
Don't think you can get away
with this, you thugs!

155
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,875
Hijikata, I feel the same way
you do, okay.

156
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,944
I'm only here because I respect
and admire Kondo...

157
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,415
<i>but he's just too much of a nice guy.</i>

158
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,852
<i>He</i> <i>can</i> <i>see</i> <i>the</i> <i>good</i> <i>in</i> <i>everyone,</i>
<i>but</i> <i>he</i> <i>refuses</i> <i>to</i> <i>see</i> <i>the</i> <i>bad.</i>

159
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:21,027
I think a couple of soft thugs like you
and me is all the Shinsengumi needs,

160
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,295
don't you agree?

161
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,066
It's getting pretty cold out here.

162
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,770
Throw another log on the fire, Okita.

163
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:32,639
Yes, sir!

164
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,912
Divine reckoning!

165
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,714
We've come to slay you,
you scoundrels!

166
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,950
Out of our way, Shogunate dogs!

167
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,054
Do you think that you samurai wannabes
can defeat a true samurai?

168
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,756
They took our invitation.

169
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,658
Let's kick the crap out of them!

170
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,960
You guys are so quick to jump
into a fight.

171
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,563
Don't let Hijikata and Okita have
all the fun!

172
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,165
Go on!
Protect the stupid toad!

173
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,236
Let's go!

174
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:11,010
"The Shinsengumi showed their mettle
by arresting Exclusionist Rebels en mass.

175
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,780
The Shocking Truth Behind
the Shogun Government's collusion

176
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,682
with crime syndicate."

177
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,384
Hey, Gin.

178
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,520
What's "collusion" mean?

179
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,259
<i>Hey!</i>

180
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,095
<i>Don't you dare play dumb with me,</i>
<i>you moptop!</i>

181
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,805
You're an unfamiliar face here.

182
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,673
Where are you from?

183
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:44,177
This park here belongs to Yo,
the Emperor of Kabukicho,

184
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,778
so you'd better get out now!

185
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:50,216
If you wanna play here, you had better
cough up three Godzilla milk caps,

186
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,117
little girlie!

187
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,086
What do you mean by that?
Guerilla Caps?

188
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,122
Is that what's popular outside
the castle walls?

189
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,892
Not "Guerilla," its "Godzilla"!

190
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,693
Or wait, hang on!
Was it Tequila?

191
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,694
I forgot.

192
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,497
No, Yo, I'm sure it must have
been "Gorilla".

193
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,999
No, you're both wrong.

194
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,501
It's more like Serial Killah.

195
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,074
That gigantic dog bit me!

196
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,142
Why you!

197
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,413
The swings around here belong to me,
Kagura, the Queen of Kabukicho.

198
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:23,583
If you want to play here, it'll cost you
a year's supply of pickled seaweed,

199
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,386
‐understand?
‐A year's supply?

200
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,022
But how am I supposed to know
how much you eat in one day!

201
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:29,989
Damn you!

202
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,091
‐We won't forget this!
‐We won't forget this!

203
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,293
Small fry.

204
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,862
You saved me, Queen of Kabukicho.

205
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,133
Thank you so very much.

206
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,035
Oh, don't mention it.

207
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,039
More importantly, you'd better
not come around here anymore.

208
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,675
This is the most dangerous part
of Edo City.

209
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:49,976
Please wait.

210
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,745
What is...

211
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,380
What is that you're eating right now?

212
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,053
What's is this?
It's so sour!

213
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,255
Even more sour than
my manny's armpits!

214
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,357
You get hooked on the sourness.

215
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,393
You'll probably get addicted
to your manny's armpits soon, too!

216
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,294
No thank you!

217
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,562
That is foul!

218
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,266
So people beyond the castle walls eat
this sort of thing?

219
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,436
This is all so new to me.

220
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,271
Are you not from around here, miss?

221
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,641
Gin and all the other losers
who live here reek of poverty,

222
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,209
but you smell very nice, miss.

223
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,544
That's right.

224
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,212
I came from all the way over there.

225
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,515
That's a huge mansion!

226
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:33,286
Gin told me once that the most important
samurai in the entire land used

227
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,253
to live there.

228
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,490
But then, after the Amanto came,

229
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,726
it's become nothing more than
a decoration,

230
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,662
where the only the most unfortunate
samurai lives.

231
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,464
You might be right.

232
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:48,635
There isn't anybody in this country
that honors that castle anymore.

233
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,705
It's an artificial castle that exists
only for show these days.

234
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,308
I wish it would just collapse.

235
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,776
Then I could be free.

236
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,211
What's wrong, miss?

237
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,746
Is something troubling you?

238
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,881
If you have a problem I can help
you solve it.

239
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,317
Jack‐of‐all‐trades Kagura,
that's me!

240
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,388
You have so many different names,
don't you?

241
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,823
Something that’s troubling me.

242
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,558
How will I ask this?

243
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,461
Will...

244
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,698
Will you be my friend
for just one day, today?

245
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,681
Man, it's so hot.

246
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,483
Why do our uniforms have
to be so thick

247
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,619
and heavy when everyone
else is switching over

248
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,320
to lighter clothing for summer?

249
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,924
And we're supposed to hunt
someone down in this heat?

250
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,392
Give me a freakin' break!

251
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:51,698
If you're that hot, I'll happily make you
a summer uniform, Hijikata.

252
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,070
That was very close!

253
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,906
Stop moving around, Hijikata,
you could get hurt.

254
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,008
The only thing trying to hurt me
here is you!

255
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,176
What's the big idea?

256
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,677
What's with you?

257
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,046
I was just about to make
your uniform sleeveless.

258
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,014
Don't give me that!

259
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,616
You were obviously trying
to cut off my arms, Okita!

260
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,218
Look, Hijikata.

261
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,755
I'm actually marketing the summer
uniforms I proposed right now.

262
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,356
How about it, Hijikata?

263
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,692
‐You'll look like a rockstar.
‐Cut out the bad jokes!

264
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,462
Only a complete moron would wear
a uniform like that!

265
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,531
Hey, how's the search going?

266
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:34,273
Finding underground
terrorists is my specialty,

267
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,576
but finding her is another story.

268
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,247
What was the princess thinking
running away from home like that?

269
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,684
Rich, fancy people have a different
set of worries, don't they.

270
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,787
I can't even begin to imagine
what trouble a princess might have.

271
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,824
Even so, she's still a young woman
of a very delicate age.

272
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,360
You know maybe her pop
won't let her have a boyfriend,

273
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,796
or her pop has bad body odor,
it could be anything.

274
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:59,031
Did you have a bad relationship
with your pop?

275
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,601
It's going to be impossible
to search through every street

276
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,935
in Edo City by ourselves.

277
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:06,506
Why don't we just throw a fancy party
to lure out the princess?

278
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:10,610
Only you would fall for a trap that sounds
straight out of a folktale, Okita!

279
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,477
Chief!

280
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,679
What is it, Yamazaki?

281
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,915
We have a sighting, Sir!

282
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,918
Apparently the princess was spotted
heading toward Kabukicho.

283
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,086
Kabukicho?

284
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,989
Of all the vile places to go.

285
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,292
Okay, place your bets!

286
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,293
Even or odd?

287
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,661
‐Odd!
‐Odd for me, too!

288
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,297
Even!
Then, I'll take Even as well.

289
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,098
I take Odd!

290
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:32,799
Even!

291
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,767
The bets are down!

292
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,102
Snake‐eyes.

293
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:36,803
Even!

294
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,205
I lost again!

295
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,440
This ain't good.
I can't go home now!

296
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,228
You're amazing, Queen!

297
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,566
You may be younger than me, but yet
you know so much about the world.

298
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:07,934
I suppose so.

299
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:12,104
All that's left is to go have a drink
and stay out until morning,

300
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,306
like the youngsters do.

301
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,576
Though, of course, everything I know,
I heard from Gin.

302
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,445
I envy you so much, Queen.

303
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:20,713
You have freedom.

304
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:24,784
I hardly ever left the castle before now
so I don't have friends

305
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,119
and I don't know anything
about the outside world.

306
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,889
All I can do is gaze out there...

307
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:33,392
<i>looking</i> <i>at</i> <i>the</i> <i>distant</i> <i>city</i>
<i>and</i> <i>using</i> <i>my</i> <i>imagination.</i>

308
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,128
<i>Wishing I could be a simple city girl,</i>

309
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,665
<i>free to skip along the streets</i>
<i>without a care in the world...</i>

310
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,634
<i>and live freely.</i>

311
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,073
After daydreaming about it every day
before I knew it

312
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,941
I had run away from the castle.

313
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,814
But, I decided that it would be
only one day from the very start.

314
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:59,051
If I were to vanish, it would cause
trouble for so many people.

315
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,152
You're exactly right, Princess.

316
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,290
So now, let us go home.

317
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,600
Hey, wait a sec,
what are you doing?!

318
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:19,805
Hey, wait up!

319
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,707
Get them!

320
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,250
Out of my way!

321
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,624
She just leapt onto the roof carrying
the princess in her arms!

322
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,060
What in the world is she?

323
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,797
Isn't she that Hercules girl
from the Odd Jobs place?

324
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,165
Why's she with the princess?

325
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,233
Beats me.

326
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,200
Hey!
Okita!

327
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,636
What're you doing, taking out
the heavy artillery?

328
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,772
I don't like taking
roundabout methods.

329
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:53,873
Wait!

330
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,274
What if you hit the princess?

331
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,377
I won't make that mistake.

332
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,881
I used to be known as the "Sniper"
back in the day, well I wish.

333
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:02,748
Hey!

334
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,383
You're just wishing to be a good shot?

335
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,320
A man does better in situations
when he's chasing his dream

336
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,421
than after he's achieved it.

337
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,221
Stop it!

338
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,957
Hey!
Come on out!

339
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,993
I don't know how you became
acquainted with Princess Soyo,

340
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,395
but she's very
important to this country.

341
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,333
<i>If you cause us any more trouble,</i>
<i>I'll have to arrest you, too.</i>

342
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,968
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

343
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,705
Dearest Queen, you've done
enough with me.

344
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,974
‐I can go home now.
‐But why?

345
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,642
Don't you still want to to be free?

346
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,944
Well, I can help to make you free!

347
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,981
I want to be free, but the thing is...

348
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,483
I don't wish to cause Your Highness
any more trouble.

349
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,818
You're no trouble at all.

350
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,188
We made a promise
to be friends all day today.

351
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,256
I don't need a reason
to help a friend.

352
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,026
That's the spirit of someone raised
in Edo City.

353
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,895
There are a whole lot of fun things
still left to teach you!

354
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,134
Yes, so you are right,
and we're friends.

355
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,703
But, well...

356
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,172
that's exactly why.

357
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,408
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

358
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,179
I would like to thank you
for all your kindness, Queen.

359
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,450
Although it was only for half a day,
I felt as though I was just a regular girl,

360
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,319
and it made me very happy.

361
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,123
Farewell.

362
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,394
Wait a sec!
That's not fair!

363
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:25,631
You made a promise to yourself and me,
and now you're just going to break it?

364
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,600
I want to have fun with you some more!

365
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,635
I want to be friends with you, Soyo!

366
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,736
This isn't fair!

367
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,371
Yes, I'm unfair like that.

368
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,073
That's why.

369
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,442
I have one last unfair favor to ask.

370
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,979
I know that I said "one day",

371
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,782
but I want you to be
my friend forever, okay?

372
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,173
<i>Why are you eating pickled seaweed?</i>

373
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,711
<i>Because</i> <i>the</i> <i>princess</i> <i>was</i> <i>eating</i> <i>it,</i>
<i>and</i> <i>she</i> <i>said</i> <i>it</i> <i>tastes</i> <i>good!</i>

374
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,314
<i>So</i> <i>now,</i> <i>Princess</i> <i>Soyo,</i>
<i>the</i> <i>Shogun's</i> <i>youngest</i> <i>sister,</i>

375
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:19,185
<i>is</i> <i>widely</i> <i>associated</i> <i>with</i> <i>the</i>
<i>unprecedented</i> <i>pickled</i> <i>seaweed</i> <i>boom.</i>

376
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:23,923
<i>The princess was seen at a recent poetry</i>
<i>gathering chewing on a stick of seaweed,</i>

377
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,158
<i>which</i> <i>has</i> <i>made</i> <i>this</i> <i>unusual</i>
<i>food</i> <i>very</i> <i>popular</i>

378
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,594
<i>‐among all people in Edo City.</i>
‐A princess who likes pickled seaweed.

379
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,929
Oh, you idiot!

380
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,664
It's got to be some kind of a scam.

381
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,101
They just do that kind of thing to try
to relate to all of us common folk,

382
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,035
you know what I mean.

383
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:39,171
They probably feast on
fois gras all day long.

384
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,741
I bet they put sushi on top
of their sushi at the castle!

385
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:43,642
Look over there.

386
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,811
There's a real pickled seaweed girl.

387
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,549
See how her sleeping face
just reeks of poverty.

388
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,785
Now that's right
there is the real thing.

389
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:11,337
Good afternoon, and welcome
to "Another Day of Cooking."

390
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:13,572
On the menu today is
an omelet with rice.

391
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:18,544
It is a tasty dish that excites children
both big and small, isn't that right?

392
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,113
Beats me, I really hate children.

393
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,084
Besides, why do I have to cook for
someone else, explain that to me, huh?

394
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,821
Why don't you shut your trap
and get started, okay, Chef?

395
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:29,722
Shinpachi, Kagura,

396
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,924
‐let's put our spirits into this!
‐Yeah!

397
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,627
We'll begin by making
the fried ketchup rice.

398
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,729
Well, Chef, what shall we do first?

399
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:40,099
Kagura, dice the vegetables
into small pieces.

400
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,300
Roger that, Chef!

401
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,638
Hey!

402
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,909
He said "the vegetables"
not "the whole kitchen!"

403
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,644
One kitchen, in small pieces.

404
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,245
Man, you are hopeless.

405
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,314
Look, this is how you cut vegetables.

406
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,582
Watch.

407
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,055
‐And that is how you do it.
‐Come on!

408
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,357
Regular people can't cut onions
with a wooden sword!

409
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,725
It just takes spirit.
Spirit!

410
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,596
If you've got spirit you can julienne,
shave fine sheets, or anything at all!

411
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,332
Excuse me, Chef.

412
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,335
You've been tossing in the ingredients
at random, you know.

413
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,305
Could you at least tell us the amounts
of each ingredient?

414
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,073
Oh, it doesn't matter.

415
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:21,840
Don't worry about it.

416
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,275
Just do whatever you feel like.

417
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:26,011
Yes but this is a cooking show,
you know,

418
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,814
so you can't just say anything
you want goes in to it.

419
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,584
Ballpark amounts are the fundamentals
of men's cooking.

420
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,886
If you just do what you feel like then...

421
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,757
We get cold Chinese noodles
with toppings.

422
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,126
When did you put in noodles?!

423
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,196
The ingredients have
been cooked thoroughly,

424
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,099
so isn't it about time
we add the rice?

425
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,468
Hey!

426
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,370
We haven't finished the dish yet!

427
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,005
You're not supposed to eat that!

428
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,807
May I have extra helpings?

429
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:55,908
We are ruined.

430
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:58,043
Hey, hey, what're we going to do?

431
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,646
We don't have any extra rice
at home to use.

432
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,281
I thought something like
this might happen,

433
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:04,950
so I prepared a completed
omelet and rice.

434
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:08,754
You don't think.

435
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,756
It better not be those poor,
innocent, abused eggs.

436
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,764
This is like modern art.

437
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,033
Will we die if we don't eat it?

438
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,736
Well, bon appétit everyone!

439
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,875
<i>A "Weird Cosmic Pet Grand Prix."</i>

440
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,343
<i>We have one at home, too!</i>

441
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,014
<i>All right! We'll win the grand prize</i>
<i>with Sadaharu! Cobra?</i>

442
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,016
<i>What're you doing here?</i>
<i>What's that thing?</i>

443
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,017
<i>It's gross!</i>

444
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:39,351
<i>The next episode…</i>

445
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,722
Apparently there's a new
ending after this.
