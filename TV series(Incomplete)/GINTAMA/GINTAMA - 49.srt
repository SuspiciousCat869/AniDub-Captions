1
00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:03,036
Uh, since all of you
are graduating,

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:05,639
today is your last class.

3
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,135
<i>Kabukicho, the Town of Greed,</i>

4
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,505
<i>a town where one can find</i>
<i>all kinds of pleasure,</i>

5
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,909
<i>drinks, women and drugs.</i>

6
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,446
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>you can't get in this town.</i>

7
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,349
<i>And tonight, these men</i>
<i>are about to seek challenges</i>

8
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,417
<i>on a whole new stage.</i>

9
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,088
‐Are you ready for this?
‐Yeah.

10
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,624
Tonight we're saying goodbye
to our dead broke jobless lives.

11
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,726
We're gonna win.

12
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,394
Everything there is to be won!

13
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,128
That's right!

14
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,629
I'm gonna win
more tons of easy money

15
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,465
than I could ever spend
in my entire life!

16
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,434
And we'll celebrate with Dom Perignon
mixed with Dom Perignon!

17
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,470
We'll drink until
we get diarrhea!

18
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,605
‐Casino, here we come!
‐Casino, here we come!

19
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,415
Is everyone ready
to place bets?

20
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,055
Odd or even?!

21
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,823
Place your bets now!

22
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,291
Even!

23
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:38,992
Odd!

24
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,327
Odd!

25
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:41,528
Odd!

26
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,964
‐Even!
‐Even!

27
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,577
Well, thank God
it isn't winter at least.

28
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,413
We'd be freezing to death.

29
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,282
That's true, but our wallets
just went into hibernation.

30
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,452
I think we have God on our side.

31
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,586
We sure do.

32
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,456
The God of Poverty
is definitely with us.

33
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,624
Now that I think about it,

34
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,326
my left shoulder's been feeling
awfully heavy lately.

35
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,728
Like there's someone on it.

36
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:15,829
Like the God of Poverty.

37
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:16,797
Don't you think?

38
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:19,132
My left shoulder's
drooping a bit.

39
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,567
You worry too much.

40
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,303
Luck won't come near you
if you always look so glum.

41
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,839
Lately I keep seeing
this creepy old man

42
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,108
in a cloak carrying
a huge scythe.

43
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,876
But I've decided
not to worry about him.

44
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,978
That I really think
you should worry about.

45
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,280
Speaking of the devil,

46
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,247
look behind you.

47
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,416
Behind you.

48
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,786
Unwanted spirits
and entities, leave now!

49
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:44,357
Eloim, Essaim,
frugativi et appelavi!

50
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,627
Talking about whether God
is on your side or not.

51
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,363
And you call yourselves gamblers?

52
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,066
These are...
the clothes they won off us!

53
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,168
But... who are you?

54
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,941
Luck is not something
that's served in a restaurant.

55
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:04,077
You can't simply wait
for the luck to come to you.

56
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,414
You have to seduce
the goddess of gambling yourself.

57
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,017
He's amazing!

58
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,954
He just keeps winning
since he came here!

59
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,389
Hey, do you see
that scar on his face?

60
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,758
Could he actually be Kanbei,
the Luck Reader?

61
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,093
"The Luck reader"?

62
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,963
<i>The unbeatable gambler</i>
<i>with amazing luck.</i>

63
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,030
<i>He's a legend!</i>

64
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,600
<i>They say he can read</i>
<i>how his luck's gonna run.</i>

65
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,869
<i>He can change</i>
<i>all odds in his favor.</i>

66
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,904
<i>He's like an idol</i>
<i>to every gambler.</i>

67
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,473
<i>I heard he disappeared</i>
<i>from Edo City for a while,</i>

68
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,909
<i>but I never thought</i>
<i>I'd get a chance to see him!</i>

69
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,648
Noooo!

70
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,821
Well, however legendary
this guy may be,

71
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,824
I didn't know the Goddess
of Gambling was such a tramp.

72
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,993
Hell, I've been working
my ass off to seduce her

73
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,694
and she won't even
look at me.

74
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,030
<i>She's probably not interested</i>
<i>in married guys.</i>

75
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,398
<i>My wife left me ages ago</i>

76
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,500
<i>so I'm practically single right now.</i>

77
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,003
<i>I'm hoping Lady Luck would have</i>
<i>a one night stand with me.</i>

78
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,605
<i>Maybe the goddess likes</i>
<i>the wild type, just like him.</i>

79
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,973
Yeah, I bet she does.

80
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,142
<i>You're right!</i>
<i>We can be wild too!</i>

81
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,710
Odd or even?

82
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,346
‐Even!
‐Even!

83
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,485
Come on, what was wrong?

84
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,020
Maybe we don't look
wild enough.

85
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,688
Maybe if we tried
to get more of

86
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,924
"I don't give a damn"
kind of look.

87
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,426
Hasegawa, take off your boxers.

88
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,229
Hey, I don't mind, but I'm not
exactly wild down there.

89
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,264
It's more on the mild side.

90
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,099
<i>What are you morons doing?</i>

91
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,069
And after everything I went through
to get your clothes back for you!

92
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,137
Are you stupid?

93
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,238
Go home already!

94
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,273
You're clearly not suited
for gambling!

95
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,242
You did that all by yourself.

96
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,810
We never asked you to!

97
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,546
Looking wild but showing
kindness once in a while.

98
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,216
Is that the secret to winning the heart
of the Goddess of gambling?

99
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,550
You're so full of it.

100
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,785
Careful not to catch a cold.

101
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,855
Adding superficial kind
words won't work!

102
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,233
<i>There are two types</i>
<i>of gamblers.</i>

103
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,435
<i>The first type are guys</i>
<i>who love to gamble.</i>

104
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,071
The second type are guys
who think they're cool

105
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,372
when they gamble,

106
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,708
and the second type
makes crazy bets.

107
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,743
<i>He gets caught up</i>
<i>in his own euphoria</i>

108
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,813
<i>and he destroys himself,</i>
<i>but the very best gamblers</i>

109
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,849
<i>place their bet when</i>
<i>they are really sure.</i>

110
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,084
<i>They don't go crossing bridges</i>

111
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,620
<i>unless they're sure</i>
<i>the bridge won't break.</i>

112
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,755
<i>You guys are obviously</i>
<i>the second type.</i>

113
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,725
<i>Just take my advice and</i>
<i>quit gambling right now.</i>

114
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,425
We're not the second type.

115
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,260
We're the third.

116
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,728
There's no such thing.

117
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,528
Sure, there is.

118
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,198
The type who is desperate
for money the easiest way.

119
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,566
So go get a job!

120
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,502
You'll never understand the feeling
of being working class like us.

121
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,537
Gamblers are just fooling
around with luck.

122
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,039
You're wrong there.

123
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,541
Life itself is like a big gamble.

124
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,043
So we are all gamblers.

125
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,311
Just shut up.

126
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,713
Anyway, seeing two guys
in a pair of boxers

127
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,283
in this sacred gambling
den is disturbing me.

128
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,818
I won't allow you to foul
this place any further.

129
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,154
What a strange guy.

130
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,740
What?

131
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,876
How did this happen to me?

132
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,544
My God, where did I
go wrong?

133
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,712
Hey, hey.

134
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:29,182
<i>Are you allowed to foul the sacred</i>
<i>gambling den with your loincloth?</i>

135
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,852
‐It's you guys!
‐Hey!

136
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:36,022
On top of that, you disgraced
your name by cheating.

137
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,558
What do you think, Hasegawa?

138
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,194
Trying to seduce Goddess
of Gambling with magic tricks?

139
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:41,895
How pitiful.

140
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:42,929
Totally pitiful.

141
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,665
And you're juxtaposed
to be a legendary gambler!

142
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,836
I already told you that
you have to create your own luck!

143
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,172
Hey, your cool dude act
won't work anymore.

144
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,440
Just look at yourself!

145
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,810
Well, you guys certainly have
some powerful bad luck.

146
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,046
It' s obvious that you took away
all of my good luck with it.

147
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,550
Oh, c'mon, all we ask
is you do us a favor.

148
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,919
Blast away all this bad luck

149
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,955
with your little tricks and
help us to make some money

150
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,523
and we won't say a word!

151
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,158
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

152
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,695
We would like you to
please come along with us.

153
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,899
Man, the God of poverty is,

154
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,701
he's always with us.

155
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,605
<i>So, these are the scumbags</i>

156
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,073
<i>who tried to cheat</i>
<i>in my gambling den.</i>

157
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,075
<i>You have quite the nerve.</i>

158
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,911
<i>Did you really think</i>
<i>you can outwit me,</i>

159
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,582
one of the Elite Four
of Kabukicho,

160
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,418
Kada, the Princess Peacock herself?

161
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,855
So are you three
prepared to die?

162
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,223
Hold it!
Hold it!

163
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,624
We didn't chea...!

164
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,128
I hate men who make excuses!

165
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,363
And you call yourself a gambler?

166
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,631
Hey, hey.

167
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,933
What a scary goddess
this one is!

168
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:58,338
She's the female leopard who controls
most of the casinos in Kabukicho.

169
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,908
<i>No one who messes in her territory</i>
<i>has ever made it out alive.</i>

170
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,444
<i>We're doomed to end up</i>
<i>at the bottom of the ocean.</i>

171
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,250
<i>I thought I recognized your face.</i>

172
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,951
<i>You are Kanbéi,</i>

173
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,554
<i>the one they call</i>
<i>"the Luck Reader."</i>

174
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,060
So the legendary gambler
of Edo City

175
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,595
turned out to be
just a cheater?

176
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:26,499
<i>I heard of your name</i>
<i>even on my planet.</i>

177
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:30,470
<i>A man who could read and change</i>
<i>his luck even in the worst situations.</i>

178
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,071
That was a long time ago.

179
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,940
Now, my luck reading
eye has closed,

180
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,475
and I can't read anything.

181
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,610
I am only a cheater now.

182
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:42,148
So you could see luck with
that closed right eye of yours.

183
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,317
Interesting.

184
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,520
Rumors say five years ago,
you lost your right eye

185
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,590
after losing in a big gambling match.

186
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,358
Surely, you can see
with your left eye

187
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,195
what you used to be able
to see with your right eye.

188
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,634
And so, I shall give you
one last chance.

189
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,281
<i>This is...</i>

190
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:19,486
It seems that our life depends
on playing a game of Mah‐jong.

191
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,353
Playing Mah‐jong?

192
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,555
Isn't this kinda wrong,
showing Mah‐jong...

193
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,157
in a wholesome samurai show?

194
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,459
Shouldn't we be playing games
like twister or jenga?

195
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,161
Well, I'm sure it has to do
with grown up matters

196
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,296
like sponsors and things.

197
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,764
Mah‐jong, huh?

198
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,033
But I only know the basic rules.

199
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,170
H‐Hasegawa, you...
you are...

200
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,639
What is it?
Is there something on me?

201
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,673
What is it?

202
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,808
What is this?!
What's this?

203
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,810
Why only me?!

204
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:51,985
It's you!

205
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:52,952
You know him?

206
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,156
<i>He's Akagé, the mah‐jong wizard,</i>
<i>member of the Kada Gang.</i>

207
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,725
<i>He's been playing for 20 years</i>
<i>and hasn't lost once.</i>

208
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,461
<i>Powerful players called Dragon</i>
<i>and Tigers and whatever</i>

209
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,862
<i>were all no match for him.</i>

210
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,731
<i>He's a living legend</i>
<i>in the underworld.</i>

211
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:05,899
<i>He has no equal.</i>

212
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,634
Well I must say,
it is an honor to meet

213
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,802
the legendary Kanbéi,
the Luck Reader.

214
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,871
Let's all enjoy tonight.

215
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,508
So this means, if we beat you,
we can leave this place alive?

216
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,143
That's right.

217
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,479
If even just one
of you beats me...

218
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,681
all three of you can go free.

219
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,283
<i>But if you lose...</i>

220
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,386
<i>you'll become fish food</i>
<i>in the bay of Edo City!</i>

221
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,623
This is ridiculous.

222
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,293
<i>Well, we have no choice</i>
<i>but to go along.</i>

223
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,528
<i>There's no other way</i>
<i>to get out of here alive.</i>

224
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,631
<i>But still, what the hell</i>
<i>is that woman thinking?</i>

225
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,600
<i>I hear that she really</i>
<i>loves gambling too.</i>

226
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,970
<i>I'm sure she's planning</i>
<i>to enjoy watching us squirm.</i>

227
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,774
<i>What a detestable woman!</i>

228
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,944
All right then,
shall we begin?

229
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,313
This is a battle to the death!

230
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:03,957
Six to the right.

231
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,525
Well, that means
you're the dealer.

232
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,526
What did you just say?

233
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:07,727
Calling me a dealer?

234
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,730
Mommy doesn't remember
raising a drug dealer!

235
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,803
This guy's eyes and his moves.

236
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,838
<i>It's obvious that</i>
<i>he's no ordinary guy.</i>

237
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,742
<i>Gin and I are the types who'll never</i>
<i>be loved by the Goddess of Gambling.</i>

238
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,211
<i>The Luck Reader</i>
<i>is our only chance!</i>

239
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,180
What?

240
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,981
Not again.

241
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,649
What's with these crappy tiles?

242
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,583
What will I do?!

243
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,684
There's no way
I can win with this!

244
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,020
That's why I didn't want to play.
This really sucks!

245
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,290
Man, we just started and he's already
talking like it's hopeless.

246
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,025
‐This really sucks!
‐All right then.

247
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,893
I guess it starts with me!

248
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,597
‐Take that!
‐Hey, you can't do that!

249
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,499
You can't just discard
three tiles like that.

250
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,601
I can't? So what?
What do I do?

251
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,936
I don't need them anyway.

252
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,104
<i>It's over.</i>

253
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,705
<i>He doesn't even know the rules.</i>

254
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,640
<i>Help, someone!</i>

255
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,541
<i>Please help us!</i>

256
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,710
You've got to be kidding me!

257
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,813
To think that such amateurs
are trying to challenge me?

258
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,448
That's fine,
I'll go easy on you

259
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,417
and let you bend the rules,
let's keep going.

260
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,386
This is impossible,
I tell you.

261
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,954
A team of three beginners
is no match

262
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,323
against a great
mahjong wizard like you.

263
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,192
Hey, hey, what's the matter,
Hasegawa?

264
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,561
<i>The match has just started, after all.</i>

265
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,897
<i>Akagé is being so kind to us,</i>

266
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,266
<i>so it's too early</i>
<i>to throw in the towel.</i>

267
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,668
Absolutely.

268
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,871
Gambling is never over
until the very, very end.

269
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,974
And I'm going to play
to win, my way!

270
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,289
<i>Where does his confidence</i>
<i>come from?</i>

271
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,259
<i>But his eyes look so sure.</i>

272
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,561
<i>Maybe a miracle will happen.</i>

273
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,530
<i>I win!</i>

274
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,933
It's Little Dragons, Half Flush,
12 thousand points!

275
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,636
I knew it was hopeless!!

276
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:57,937
We don't stand a chance!

277
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,607
I was a fool to even think that
we had a chance for a second!

278
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,910
Now, now, don't get too dismayed.

279
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,478
This is just one game we lost.

280
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,579
There are more.

281
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,314
<i>That's right.</i>

282
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,750
<i>We still have the Luck Reader</i>
<i>on our side.</i>

283
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,153
<i>The man with amazing luck</i>
<i>who can turn the tide!</i>

284
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,354
<i>I win!</i>

285
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,092
It's Pure Outside Hand Three colors,
12 thousand points!

286
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,993
Aww, come on!
We can't win!

287
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,695
We will never win!

288
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,465
<i>Pong! Chow!</i>
<i>I win!</i>

289
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,000
<i>Kong! It's a Reach!</i>

290
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,001
<i>It's a draw!</i>

291
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,870
<i>It's All Simples, All Runs,</i>
<i>Three Colors,</i>

292
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,905
<i>Dora Dora, 12 thousand points!</i>

293
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,211
<i>It's over.</i>

294
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,979
Each of you has zero points.

295
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:43,149
It's called Hakoten, meaning you have
nothing to bet anymore.

296
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,419
Hakoten or "one to ten,"
I don't care!

297
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:49,522
A man's worth is not determined
by how many points he has!

298
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,958
<i>No? Then, what will you do?</i>

299
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,667
Well, I'm not letting you
win the next game, honey!

300
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,836
Play strip mah‐jong?!

301
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,105
The godfather used to say,

302
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,040
"a man who doesn't
take off his shirt

303
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,009
can never be a real man."

304
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,778
He never said that!

305
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,447
Sounds like fun.

306
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,582
Alright, fine, let's play
another round.

307
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,017
We'll play again.

308
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:22,588
The most important thing
for a gambler to have is guts.

309
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,424
And he certainly seems
to have that.

310
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,629
<i>But it's never</i>
<i>really that easy, is it?</i>

311
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,198
<i>You can't just win</i>
<i>by having guts.</i>

312
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,635
<i>Calm down, you guys.</i>

313
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:39,138
<i>After all, one must never lose</i>
<i>his cool when gambling.</i>

314
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,440
<i>Even if you are</i>
<i>surrounded in flames,</i>

315
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,843
you must always
keep a cool mind.

316
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:44,944
I'm cold already.

317
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,380
<i>In fact, my mind and body</i>
<i>are both freezing!</i>

318
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,986
Well now, it seems you have
nothing else to strip then.

319
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,155
It is game over.

320
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,457
How boring this was.

321
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,494
I thought I could enjoy
this a bit longer.

322
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,697
To think, a legendary man
known as the Luck Reader

323
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,699
could be this weak.

324
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,634
Playtime is over, gentlemen.

325
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,970
Now I am taking your lives.

326
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,706
Sorry, but it's the end
of the line for you.

327
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,881
<i>He's the legendary Wizard,</i>
<i>after all.</i>

328
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,583
<i>He's way above us.</i>

329
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,251
<i>This is the end of us.</i>

330
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,422
Listen, pops.

331
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,024
I wanted to ask you
just one little thing.

332
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,160
<i>When your right eye was good,</i>

333
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,395
<i>were you really able</i>
<i>to see luck?</i>

334
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,198
Well he probably cheated
that for all I know.

335
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,433
Don't you worry.

336
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,668
I'll take over
that legend from tonight.

337
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,636
You shut up!

338
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,571
Just shut up and be quiet!

339
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:51,177
If I could see luck,
I wouldn't be one‐eyed today.

340
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:57,016
<i>Kanbéi, your little friend has</i>
<i>caused some real trouble for us.</i>

341
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,985
<i>How are you going</i>
<i>to settle this?!</i>

342
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,754
<i>There is only but one thing</i>
<i>I can say.</i>

343
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,489
<i>I just remembered.</i>

344
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:07,093
<i>I hear you have a pretty</i>
<i>interesting right eye, Kanbéi.</i>

345
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,195
<i>I heard it can read luck.</i>

346
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,301
I have always made
choices in my life

347
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,737
that I won't regret later on.

348
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:21,440
<i>If you want him to live,</i>
<i>cut out your right eye!</i>

349
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,745
I have always done
exactly as I wanted

350
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:28,114
in gambling and in real life.

351
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,018
And this is how you ended up?

352
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,720
In the end, you're not as much
of a man as they say you are.

353
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,323
And trust me I'll prove it
to you right now!

354
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,460
They're mine!

355
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,262
Now I'll stop their breathing.

356
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:45,865
It's a reach!

357
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,700
‐I win!
‐What?

358
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,037
I said I win!

359
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,806
<i>It's Seven Pairs!</i>

360
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,441
<i>Damn right, he won!</i>

361
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,410
what, but how?

362
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,411
How can you?

363
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,713
I thought you didn't
even know the rules!

364
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,114
No, I really don't.

365
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,450
That's why I played
however I wanted to.

366
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,786
I didn't know I had
a winning hand until just now.

367
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,521
Besides, I really don't like you.

368
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,056
As long as you don't beat me,

369
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,124
I don't give a damn
about the rest.

370
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,893
That's utterly insane!

371
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,841
Wh‐what, but how?

372
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,076
How can you?

373
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,311
I thought you didn't
even know the rules!

374
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,713
No, I really don't.

375
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,048
That's why I played
however I wanted to.

376
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,417
I didn't know I had
a winning hand until just now.

377
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,152
Besides, I really don't like you.

378
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,687
As long as you don't beat me,

379
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,456
I don't give a damn
about the rest.

380
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,424
That's utterly insane!

381
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,963
He really is insane for sure,

382
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,133
but it looks like lady luck
is on our side now.

383
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,735
Let's do it, pops!

384
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,270
‐It is payback time!
‐It is payback time!

385
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,807
Reach, All Simples, All Runs,
Dora Dora Dragon Punch!

386
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,609
<i>East, South, West, North!</i>

387
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,378
<i>King's Tile Draw!!</i>

388
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,412
<i>Excessive tiles!</i>

389
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,146
<i>Lack of tiles!</i>

390
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,948
<i>Foul! Peeping!</i>
<i>Rule Breakers!</i>

391
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,282
<i>‐Double East, Double South...</i>
<i>‐Double East, Double South...</i>

392
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,917
<i>‐Double Reach Kick!!</i>
<i>‐Double Reach Kick!!</i>

393
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:12,952
<i>We're no small fries!</i>

394
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,320
<i>So don't mess with us!</i>

395
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,093
Now we're all naked.

396
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,462
So let's settle it
with the next game.

397
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,000
<i>I can't lose to these guys.</i>

398
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,403
<i>Princess Peacock won't abide losers.</i>

399
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,538
<i>If I lose now,</i>
<i>I'll be killed.</i>

400
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,875
<i>I'll do whatever it takes to win.</i>

401
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,743
<i>Whatever it takes!</i>

402
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,818
Well, I guess
I underestimated you guys.

403
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,019
But this is it.

404
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,422
I'll finish you off
with this one deal.

405
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:53,426
I'll send both, you and
Kanbéi straight to hell!

406
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,662
<i>I know that I can't win</i>
<i>by playing fair...</i>

407
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,598
<i>but I still have</i>
<i>my final weapon.</i>

408
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,569
<i>Sorry, but you're gonna</i>
<i>have to disappear!</i>

409
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,540
Lethal weapon!

410
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,675
<i>Giant Tiger Illusion Tiles!</i>

411
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,279
<i>I can shuffle</i>
<i>1,000 tiles per second!</i>

412
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,947
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>you can see my moves!</i>

413
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,285
Oh, sorry...

414
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:22,154
I was sitting for so long,
my legs were starting to hurt.

415
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,623
It wasn't on purpose, really.

416
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,293
Oh man, what a mess this is.

417
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,894
Let's put the tiles back.

418
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,995
I'll help you.

419
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,630
Stop it!

420
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:34,700
Never mind.

421
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:37,603
<i>Damn it.</i>

422
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,539
<i>Some of my tiles</i>
<i>ended up in the wrong position.</i>

423
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:44,343
<i>Especially that row</i>
<i>that the sunglass guy piled.</i>

424
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,945
<i>I have to get it back!</i>

425
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:47,980
<i>It's all right.</i>

426
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,382
<i>It might take time,</i>
<i>but it's no problem.</i>

427
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,784
Here I come!

428
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,053
Well, bring it on!

429
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,296
What is this called?

430
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,332
Hey, I just... well...
I'm the dealer,

431
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:09,602
so I was about to discard
one tile and look!

432
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,170
It seems like I win!

433
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,939
See... It's only "all runs" but...

434
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,976
It doesn't matter
what hand it is.

435
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:19,145
You have a winning tile
from the beginning!

436
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,280
Heavenly hand?

437
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,917
Good fortune bestowed
upon man by Heaven!

438
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:28,721
Heavenly hand?
Impossible!

439
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:31,056
How can that possibly be?!

440
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,160
So finally, in the end,
the Goddess of Gambling

441
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,996
decided to have a one
night stand with me!

442
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,965
You did it, Hasegawa!

443
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,434
I always knew you had it
in you all along!

444
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,669
How could this have happened?!

445
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:44,670
Where did I go wrong?

446
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,772
I don't understand
where I went wrong.

447
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,008
<i>...will keep loving me forever.</i>

448
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,412
That's life for you, isn't it?

449
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,084
Say Gin, let's go celebrate

450
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,387
before the Goddess of
Gambling turns away from me.

451
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:02,688
That sounds good.

452
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,423
How about we splurge
on some Dom Perignon

453
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,591
mixed with Dom Perignon?

454
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,259
Take it easy, you guys.

455
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,565
You useless bastard!

456
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:27,546
Well then, that's why gambling is...

457
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,286
What happened?

458
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,338
You all flunked the grade.

459
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,806
Come back to class next year!

460
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,742
Everyone repeats the grade!
