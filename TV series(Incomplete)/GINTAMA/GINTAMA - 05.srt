1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,071
<i>The land of the samurai.</i>

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,806
<i>There was a time,</i>
<i>a long time ago</i>

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,908
<i>when our country</i>
<i>was called by that name.</i>

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,344
<i>With the arrival</i>
<i>of the "Amanto"</i>

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,145
<i>or Sky People</i>
<i>and the Sword Ban</i>

6
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:15,649
<i>enacted 20 years ago</i>
<i>the samurai class fell into decline.</i>

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,788
<i>In these hard times there was one man left</i>
<i>with the spirit of the samurai.</i>

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,591
<i>His name is Gintoki Sakata,</i>

9
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,793
<i>a reckless jack of all trades</i>

10
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,862
<i>with a serious sweet tooth</i>
<i>and a big heart.</i>

11
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,397
<i>Due to some rather</i>
<i>unexpected events,</i>

12
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,367
<i>I, Shinpachi Shimura and</i>
<i>Kagura, work here now.</i>

13
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:37,604
<i>The three of us working together</i>
<i>fight the corruption on the planet!</i>

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,140
<i>Is this that kind of anime?</i>

15
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,500
<i>Hey, you swine!</i>

16
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,736
The huge stash of chocolate
I've been stashing away

17
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,005
for a special occasion
has disappeared.

18
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,307
I want whoever ate it to raise
your hand and confess.

19
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,110
Do it now and I'll only kill you
in three fourths of the way.

20
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,578
Three fourths of the way?

21
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,847
That's barely any better
than being killed all the way!

22
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:30,250
Besides, if you don't take it easy on
sugar, you really will get diabetes.

23
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,421
Another Amanto embassy attacked.

24
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,090
Serial terrorist bombing
rampage continues.

25
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,660
The world sure is
a very violent place.

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,463
Oh, but I'm so scared,
Daddy, Mommy!

27
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,565
You are the one
that's scary here.

28
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,201
Trying to look all innocent while
you're bleeding from your nose.

29
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,537
Tell me, were my chocolates tasty?

30
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,572
You think I got a nosebleed
from eating chocolate?

31
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:53,640
Oh, please!

32
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,674
Don't play dumb!

33
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,577
I can smell the sugar in your blood
wafting through the air!

34
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,745
Don't be so silly.

35
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,781
I just went in for a booger
a little too deep.

36
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:03,350
<i>Too bad you missed your brain</i>
<i>while you were digging in there!</i>

37
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,852
<i>Have you used</i>
<i>a drill to do that?</i>

38
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,554
<i>What kind of nonsense</i>
<i>talk is that?</i>

39
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,889
<i>Just chill out already!</i>

40
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,728
Oh, man, what's the ruckus?

41
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,730
‐What happened?
‐Did you see?

42
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,466
‐What happened?
‐Are you okay?

43
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,534
An accident?

44
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,509
Moron!

45
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,447
What are you doing, smashing into
my storefront like that?

46
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,582
I hope you're prepared
to die, moron!

47
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,451
I'm... I'm sorry, ma'am.

48
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,853
I dozed off because
I didn't sleep well last night.

49
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:40,554
No problem!

50
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,956
I'm gonna make sure that
you close your eyes forever!

51
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:43,957
Don't, Otose!

52
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,692
Don't treat an injured person
like that!

53
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,194
Are you all right?

54
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,129
Ye... yeah.

55
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,098
This is really bad.

56
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,100
Hey, Kagura,
call for an ambulance.

57
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,068
Ambulance!

58
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,971
Oh, that's a pretty primitive way
of calling for an ambulance!

59
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,408
You're a postman, huh?

60
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,610
Well, your packages are now
a complete mess!

61
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,712
Please, please, sir.

62
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,749
Please, sir, deliver this package
in my place.

63
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:15,722
I think that this package is very
important and must be delivered.

64
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,057
If I fail to deliver it,

65
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,391
I might lose my job.

66
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,161
Please do this...

67
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,296
Hey!

68
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,740
Are you sure that
this is the place?

69
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,474
Yup.

70
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,942
An Embassy.

71
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,378
This is Planet Canis' Embassy!

72
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,913
The Canis from
he Dog Star System

73
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,482
were the first of the Amanto
to come to earth, weren't they?

74
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,017
Yeah, they're the scary ones

75
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,821
who fired cannons at the Edo Castle
and forced the country to open up.

76
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,757
This is a nasty place,
that's for sure.

77
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,259
‐Hey!
‐Huh?

78
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,195
What are you three doing
here at our Embassy?

79
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,830
Are you trying get ruffed up?

80
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:00,167
Uh, we were actually just asked
to deliver a package here.

81
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,235
Come on, Kagura,
hand it over!

82
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,638
Come here, little doggy.

83
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,639
I'll give you a treat.

84
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,940
What do you think
you're doing?

85
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,775
Oh, hey, here it is.

86
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:12,179
I didn't hear anything at all about
a package being delivered today.

87
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:15,348
Lately we've been receiving a lot of
terrorist threats to bomb this place,

88
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,784
and security is very tight.
Go home.

89
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,886
Well, it might be dog food inside.

90
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:20,921
So, why not just take it?

91
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,489
As if I'd eat that garbage!

92
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,736
My brain is not quite comprehending
what just happened,

93
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,805
but I think I have figured out
our next move.

94
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,275
‐Run away!
‐Where do you think you're going?

95
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,615
Shinpachi!
What do you think you're doing?

96
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,616
Let me go!

97
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,317
No way!

98
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,618
They're not taking me alone!

99
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,886
Can't you just
be cool and say,

100
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,621
"Just leave me,
save yourselves"?

101
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,057
Why don't you just leave me
and let me save myself?

102
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,759
Shut up! If they take me,
I'm taking you with me!

103
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,130
Waah! Are you fur‐real!, man?

104
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,002
These guys are such
a pain in the butt.

105
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,444
Huh?

106
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,618
It's time to go, Gintoki.

107
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,987
What? You're Cobra?

108
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:27,988
Kotaro Cobra?

109
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,558
My name is Katsura,
not Cobra!

110
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:33,960
Man, you jerk!

111
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,462
We see each other
for the first time in ages

112
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,696
and that's how you greet me?

113
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,898
Because I've told you
a thousand times

114
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,101
to stop calling me
by that nickname.

115
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,903
Anyway what exactly
are you even doing here?

116
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,507
How long are you going
to keep barking?

117
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,743
‐Save it for later, Gintoki.
‐Right.

118
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,459
<i>Wait!</i>
<i>Come back here!</i>

119
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,529
Oh, he finally exposed himself.

120
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,565
‐Yamazaki!
‐Sir!

121
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,468
Follow them and track down
their base, at any cost.

122
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,503
Yes, sir!

123
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:21,141
With all the Sky People
living in the world these days,

124
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,376
even the famed hero
of the Amanto war

125
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,779
is nothing more than
just another criminal.

126
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,650
It takes real guts to still be fighting
the Amanto in the current situation.

127
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,919
Hey, Okita, wake up.

128
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,591
How is it that you were able to
just sleep through that explosion?

129
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,260
Explosion?

130
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:43,129
Did you fail to stop a
terrorist attack again?

131
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,565
Come on, what are you doing,
Hijikata?

132
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,500
Are you even trying
to stop them?

133
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,769
Do you want me
to put you back to sleep?

134
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,340
They can blow up all the Amanto
in the Capital for all I care.

135
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,309
I'll let those fishes swim
for a bit before I'll reel them in,

136
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,545
line them up,
and slit their throats.

137
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,980
It'll be a proud moment
for the Shinsengumi.

138
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,283
I'm looking forward
to this fight.

139
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,755
<i>Another bombing targeting the Amanto</i>
<i>Embassies has just been reported in.</i>

140
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,157
<i>Our reporter Maya Sizitzy</i>
<i>is on the scene!</i>

141
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,159
<i>Maya Sizitzy, are you there?</i>

142
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,127
<i>Maya Sizitzy!</i>

143
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,995
<i>Yes, Maya Sizitzy on the scene.</i>

144
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,366
<i>This time, the despicable bomber has</i>
<i>attacked a Planet Canis' Embassy.</i>

145
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,468
<i>Luckily, nobody has been</i>
<i>injured or killed.</i>

146
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,972
<i>Oh, it seems we've just received</i>
<i>word that the alleged terrorists</i>

147
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,841
<i>were caught by</i>
<i>a security camera.</i>

148
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,543
<i>Wow, you can see them</i>
<i>very clearly!</i>

149
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,846
<i>You can really see us very clearly.</i>

150
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,414
<i>What will I do?</i>

151
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,216
My sister is going to kill me.

152
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,417
I'm on TV?

153
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,085
I've got to call home!

154
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,054
Do you think this is all
some sort of conspiracy?

155
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,123
How did we even
end up in this mess?

156
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,460
We were very lucky that Katsura
intervened in that situation.

157
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,697
To think he'd actually
shelter us during all this, Gintoki.

158
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,332
He's a friend of yours, isn't he?

159
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,567
Exactly, what sort of person is he?

160
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,438
‐Uh... a terrorist bomber.
‐Huh? What?

161
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,307
Stop using that terrible word,
Gintoki.

162
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,613
We are not terrorists,
and you know it.

163
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,482
What we are,
are Freedom Fighters!

164
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,856
Oh, so we finally
received a lead?

165
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,527
Yes, Yamazaki is on their trail
right now.

166
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:25,165
It's only a matter of time before
we discover their base, Kondo sir.

167
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,599
I see.

168
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,668
Excellent work, Hijikata.

169
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,905
It's a little too soon
to thank me.

170
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,075
Save it for after
we've slaughtered them all!

171
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,977
Yes, of course.

172
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,881
The Shinsengumi only give credit after
displaying distinguished military service.

173
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:45,819
The only place we, the Shinsengumi,
belong in is battle.

174
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:49,656
Hm, well, you're the chief
and I'm just following orders.

175
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,358
I'm counting on you, Hijikata!

176
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,461
Sir.

177
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,136
<i>There are two malicious</i>
<i>looking guys at the entrance.</i>

178
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,376
No doubt about it,
this must be it.

179
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,946
Mom, is that man
a peeping tom?

180
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,448
Yu, you mustn't grow up
to be like that.

181
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,484
Shouldn't we report him
to the police?

182
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:23,256
We must force out the Amanto
that pollute this country

183
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:26,326
and rebuild it into the land
of samurai once again.

184
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,863
We're eradicating the Sky People
in order to protect this country.

185
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,664
Foreigner expulsion?

186
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,600
What is that?

187
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:39,038
<i>Foreigner Expulsion is an ideology that</i>
<i>sprang up during the first Amanto attacks.</i>

188
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,674
<i>It refers to the desire</i>
<i>to drive out any aliens.</i>

189
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,944
<i>The</i> <i>Amanto</i> <i>had</i> <i>been</i> <i>heavily</i> <i>pressuring</i>
<i>us</i> <i>to</i> <i>open</i> <i>our</i> <i>borders</i> <i>to</i> <i>them</i>

190
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,081
<i>and feeling threatened.</i>
<i>The samurai rose up together</i>

191
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,216
<i>and fought to drive them out of Edo City.</i>

192
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:01,528
<i>But confronted by the Amanto's immense</i>
<i>power, the government surrendered.</i>

193
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:06,733
<i>They abandoned the samurai and signed a</i>
<i>disadvantageous treaty with the Amanto.</i>

194
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,068
<i>The Amanto who now had control</i>
<i>over the government</i>

195
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,237
<i>proceeded to take away</i>
<i>the samurai's swords,</i>

196
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,506
<i>rendering them completely powerless.</i>

197
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,742
<i>Afterwards...</i>

198
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,646
rumor had it the exclusionists
had been purged

199
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,348
and that none still existed.

200
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,416
Exactly right.

201
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,618
It seems like we've been
taken advantage of.

202
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,555
‐Huh?
‐Isn't that right, Mr. Postman?

203
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,057
Hey, Gintoki's right!

204
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,026
I remember those bushy eyebrows.

205
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,361
Hold on. Why are you here,
Mr. Bushy brows?

206
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,131
This is all you're doing,
isn't it, Katsura?

207
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:41,501
All these recent attacks against the
Amanto that have everyone panicking.

208
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,637
There was something I had
to get my hands on,

209
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,839
even if it meant getting them
dirty once again.

210
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,445
Gintoki, won't you take up
your sword alongside me

211
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,315
just once more in order
to rebuild this corrupt country?

212
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,818
Lend me the strength that made you
feared as the White Knight

213
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,486
just one more time.

214
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,037
Gintoki, won't you take up your sword
alongside me just once more

215
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,106
in order to rebuild
this corrupt country?

216
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,343
Lend me the strength that made you
feared as the White Knight

217
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,078
just one more time.

218
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,186
<i>So this is it then.</i>

219
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,122
<i>We will not surrender.</i>

220
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:40,526
<i>Let's finish this battle with honor and</i>
<i>take our own lives as true warriors.</i>

221
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,662
<i>‐Don't be an idiot.</i>
<i>‐What?</i>

222
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,197
<i>Stand up.</i>

223
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,868
<i>If you've got enough time to fantasize</i>
<i>about your glamorous death,</i>

224
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:52,305
<i>why not get up and live</i>
<i>your life glamorously?</i>

225
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,212
<i>Let's do this, Cobra.</i>

226
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,281
<i>My name is Katsura,</i>
<i>not Cobra!</i>

227
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,955
<i>His</i> <i>silver</i> <i>hair</i> <i>was</i> <i>soaked</i>
<i>in</i> <i>blood,</i> <i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>way</i>

228
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,556
<i>he plowed</i>
<i>through the battlefield,</i>

229
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,125
<i>he was like a Demon Knight.</i>

230
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,296
It was he who fought with the infernal
might of the demonic lords

231
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,630
against the Amanto.

232
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,000
A god of war, feared not only by his
enemies but by his own people.

233
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:25,938
Gintoki Sakata, lend us your strength once
again to fight against the Amanto.

234
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:30,510
Gintoki, you were involved in
the Foreigner Expulsion War too?

235
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,479
Yes, although he disappeared
as soon as the war ended.

236
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,649
And I never really knew what
was going on inside your head.

237
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,885
I like a good fight as much
as the next guy,

238
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,421
but what I really hate
are sore losers.

239
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,557
Our war against
the Amanto is over.

240
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:47,226
How long are you going to keep
clinging to it on and on and on?

241
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,861
What are you,
a desperate ex?

242
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,163
Don't be an idiot!

243
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,598
And you know that girls
are always clingy.

244
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:55,501
The reason you're so unpopular is
because your heart isn't big enough

245
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,403
to embrace the people
as they are.

246
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:58,337
Listen to me.

247
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,908
If my hair wasn't a mop top
I'd definitely be popular with girls!

248
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:02,608
I think.

249
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,978
There you go again blaming
everything on your mop top hair.

250
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,246
You are so pathetic.

251
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,648
Who are you calling pathetic?

252
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,683
People use their inferiority complexes...

253
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,718
‐...as springboards to greatness.
‐Enough of this!

254
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,586
What are you two talking about?

255
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,226
Our fight against the Amanto
is still far from over.

256
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,129
And I know that deep down,
even you're still fighting.

257
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,564
Gintoki...

258
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:29,202
<i>You grieve for this country and resent</i>
<i>the government and the Amanto</i>

259
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,305
<i>for taking the lives of all the people</i>
<i>who fought alongside you.</i>

260
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,811
Let's cleanse the land of the Amanto
and rebuild this decaying country.

261
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,014
It's the only way those of us
who managed to stay alive

262
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,883
can honor the memory
of our dead.

263
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,121
<i>Our next target in this battle</i>
<i>is the Sky Terminal.</i>

264
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:52,024
<i>We shall destroy that accursed tower</i>
<i>that summons the Amanto here</i>

265
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,560
<i>and annihilate the pests</i>
<i>that live in Edo City.</i>

266
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,163
However, the tower
is well guarded.

267
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:58,898
We won't be able
to attack easily.

268
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,200
We need your strength,
Gintoki.

269
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,168
Come on, man.

270
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,703
I've been telling you
that I am not...

271
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,105
It's too late, you've already
assisted us in the bombing,

272
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,707
so you can't refuse.

273
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,375
Unless you want to be
treated as a terrorist,

274
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,577
you have no choice
but to come with us.

275
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,212
There's no need to hesitate.

276
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:16,282
Your place has always been here
with us, with the samurai.

277
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,850
Gintoki.

278
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,824
You are all under arrest!

279
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:27,393
Come quietly, you terrorist scum!

280
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,095
‐It's the Shinsengumi!
‐This is no good!

281
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,496
Run away!

282
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,498
Kill every single one of them!

283
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,003
Who... who...
who are those people?

284
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,572
They're the Shinsengumi,
the Armed Police.

285
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:43,209
An elite anti‐terrorist squadron assembled
to wipe out rebel elements!

286
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,044
Those guys are really troublesome, boss.

287
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,412
What should we do now?

288
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,914
I'm not your freakin' boss!

289
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,816
And you're the troublesome
one, Katsura!

290
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,718
Cobra, if you need a boss,
I'm your woman!

291
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,721
"Whether you're doing something good
or doing something bad, be the boss."

292
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,856
That's my motto!

293
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,324
Will you shut up, Kagura!

294
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,394
Your motto sound like something out
of those stupid self coaching books!

295
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,695
Hey!

296
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,300
Why are you running away?

297
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,036
Stay a little while
and let's have some fun.

298
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,672
Tell me this, are you really
a government official?

299
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,240
I'm surprised you passed
the interview.

300
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,675
Your pupils are dilated.

301
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,510
You should talk,
mop haired creep!

302
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,879
Because you have the eyes
of a dead fish!

303
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,250
It's all right, because they sparkle
during my close‐ups.

304
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,686
There's no way they sparkle!

305
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,129
You're pretty good.

306
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,466
There aren't many people who
can keep up with my expert moves.

307
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,801
Oh, that's dangerous man.

308
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,870
What were you gonna do
if that actually hit me?

309
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,871
Are you stupid?

310
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,607
I'm trying to kill you,
so I meant to hit you!

311
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,985
Hijikata, you might want to watch out.

312
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,971
Are you still alive, Hijikata?

313
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,139
Are you stupid?

314
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,807
You could've killed me with that!

315
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,910
Darn, I'm sorry I missed.

316
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,378
What do you mean you're sorry?

317
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,646
Hey, look at me!

318
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:27,947
Hey!

319
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,216
So, where are they?

320
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,285
Vice‐chief, they're in here.

321
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,521
<i>Hey, come on out!</i>

322
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,890
<i>Your resistance is meaningless!</i>

323
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,092
Did you grow more hair?

324
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,827
<i>You are on the fifteenth floor.</i>

325
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,963
<i>There's no escaping us</i>
<i>from up here!</i>

326
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,199
What are you doing
with that thing?

327
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,668
This is a time bomb.

328
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,937
I was going to use it
to blow up the sky terminal,

329
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,406
but I now have no choice
but to use it here.

330
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,141
I'll give you guys a little present,

331
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,510
and you can escape
in the confusion.

332
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,515
You moron! What do you think
you're doing to Katsura?

333
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:06,218
Katsura, let's stop
this nonsense already.

334
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,387
No matter how much blood
you get on your hands,

335
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,256
our dead buddies
won't come back,

336
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,258
nor will the world change.

337
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,094
Stop getting your hands dirty.

338
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,964
You're the one that has dirt
on his hands, Gintoki.

339
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:21,567
You've had it ever since you switched
sides as soon as we lost the war.

340
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:26,072
A warrior should always remain devoted
to defending whatever he believes in.

341
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:30,042
What's the point in sticking to some
code that someone else has laid out?

342
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:34,413
Or are you looking forward to losing more
of your precious friends again by fighting?

343
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,651
Because I don't want
that anymore.

344
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,221
If it's my life on the line,
I'll adhere to my own code.

345
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,057
I'll live exactly
how I want to live,

346
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,526
and I'll protect
what I want to protect.

347
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:54,767
Gintoki, I was fiddling with this thing
and accidentally pushed the switch.

348
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,969
‐What a nightmare.
‐How cliché.

349
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,738
Hey, come on out!

350
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,840
We'll fire unless you comply.

351
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,411
Hijikata, our favorite evening TV show
reruns are gonna be starting soon.

352
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,614
Oh, man, I forgot
to set my VCR.

353
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,016
Let's get this over with.

354
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,717
Prepare to fire!

355
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,887
Fire!

356
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,593
What... what are you doing?

357
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,293
Stop them!

358
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,963
If you want to stop something,
then stop this bomb, please!

359
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,564
Don't you all have a
bomb squad or something?

360
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,766
Come on, I know you do!

361
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,934
Look out!
He's got a bomb!

362
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,472
Hold on!
Hey, wait!

363
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,907
Shinpachi,

364
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,109
you once said that you were good
with machines, didn't you?

365
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,711
What me?
When did I ever say that?

366
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,447
Kagura, you take it, this all happened
because of your stupid misuse!

367
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:42,348
My misuse?

368
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,583
Gintoki, your mop top looks like
it would make a good fuse!

369
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,618
Huh?

370
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,519
What are we doing?

371
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,653
I'm a bit confused!

372
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,755
Eeek! What about
a hypotenuse?

373
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,190
Eeek! What hippopotamus?

374
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,125
Eeek! Just get somebody
to help us!

375
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,294
Oh, this is such a a mess!

376
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,962
‐And she makes the pass!
‐Oh, come on!

377
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,297
How long is this gonna last?

378
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,232
Enough, we need cut out
this rhyming crap!

379
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,667
Crap, crap!
Okay, let's stahp!

380
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,202
Hey, who on earth says stahp?

381
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,805
That's stupid! That's almost as bad
as saying black shevel!

382
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:06,739
Huh?

383
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,709
There's only ten seconds left!

384
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,877
Gin, the window, the window!

385
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,612
We're not going to make it!
We're so dead!

386
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,714
‐Gintoki, grit your teeth!
‐Huh?

387
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,003
‐Gin... Gintoki!
‐Bye, Gin!

388
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,272
See you in the next life!

389
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,887
<i>If you've got enough time to fantasize</i>

390
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,491

391
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,230

We made it!

399
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:31,490
All right.
