1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:03,237
<i>Gin, Gin, you won't believe this!</i>

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,771
<i>What's up, Mr. four eyes?</i>

3
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,607
<i>The guy who was stalking</i>
<i>my sister!</i>

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,776
<i>He's Isao Kondo, the bureau chief</i>
<i>of the Shinsengumi!</i>

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,645
<i>Yeah, I already knew that.</i>

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,679
<i>But who did you hear it from?</i>

7
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:14,748
<i>‐From Johnny.</i>
<i>‐From Johnny?</i>

8
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,016
Yeah, Johnny.

9
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,208
Hey, auntie.

10
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,444
Give me some pickled seaweed!

11
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,845
<i>Come again.</i>

12
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:57,851
<i>Doo doo doo,</i>
<i>dee doo doo...</i>

13
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,421
<i>‐Whoa!</i>
<i>‐Whoa!</i>

14
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,157
<i>What the hell is with its size?</i>
<i>It's huge!</i>

15
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,726
<i>There's no way it's real!</i>

16
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,163
What are you doing hanging around
the front of my place, you brats?

17
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,567
Did you find a dirty magazine
or something?

18
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,036
Ah! It's the weird seaweed girl!

19
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,672
Run away, or you'll smell
fishy just like her!

20
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,544
Those little brats can go home
and suck their moms' teats.

21
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,695
<i>All right, now let's hear a special report</i>
<i>from the Sky Terminal.</i>

22
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,363
<i>Maya Sizitzy is on the scene!</i>

23
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:44,398
<i>Maya Sizitzy!!</i>

24
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,067
Yes, Maya Sizitzy at the scene.

25
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,335
Here at the Sky Terminal,

26
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,437
hordes of reporters have
gathered and they are all

27
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,940
eagerly waiting the arrival of the ship
that is carrying Prince Hata.

28
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,744
<i>Oh, the gate at the Sky Terminal</i>
<i>is opening!</i>

29
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,781
<i>It seems that Prince Hata's spaceship</i>
<i>has finally arrived.</i>

30
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,731
<i>During his return visit to Edo City,</i>
<i>Prince Kaka...</i>

31
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:22,169
<i>uh, I mean, Prince Hata plans to visit</i>
<i>the newly constructed Edo Zoo,</i>

32
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,605
<i>followed by more visits to</i>
<i>many other zoos and aquariums.</i>

33
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,941
<i>Oh, there he is!</i>

34
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,278
<i>Prince Hata of the Midland Star</i>
<i>has stepped out of his spaceship</i>

35
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,913
<i>and he is waving to us!</i>

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,516
It's been a very long time,
everyone!

37
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,485
I'm so overjoyed.

38
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,288
No need for formalities.

39
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,722
No need at all.

40
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,862
Oh, the Prince!

41
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,963
Who did that to him?

42
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,565
Was it you
or was it you?

43
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,500
‐It was you, wasn't it?
‐I'm pretty sure that it was you.

44
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,935
<i>That's all, at least for now.</i>

45
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,736
<i>Maya Sizitzy reporting</i>
<i>from the scene.</i>

46
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,106
Apparently that stupid
animal obsessed prince

47
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,974
has come back to Edo City.

48
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,642
How about that, Gin?

49
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,814
Hey, man,
are you listening to me?

50
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:09,883
I'm back, everyone!

51
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,518
Oh! Welcome back, Kagura.

52
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,421
Did you get the toilet paper
that I asked you for?

53
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,555
Here you go.

54
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,191
Okay, Kagura, listen up.

55
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:22,262
Usually people buy toilet paper
in packs of several rolls, okay?

56
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,597
If someone gets diarrhea

57
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,499
there's no way
this will ever be enough.

58
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,368
Quit nagging me about
the toilet paper, Shinpachi!

59
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,337
What are you,
my mother‐in‐law?

60
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,439
After all, there are poor
samurai in this world

61
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,775
who pretend newspapers
are toilet papers, you know!

62
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,543
I don't think anyone
is that desperate!

63
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,044
Who told you that anyway?

64
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,646
Gin told me!
Ask him!

65
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,482
How many times have I told you
not to trust what he says?

66
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,950
Shut up, will ya?

67
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,085
Don't act like a know it all

68
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,754
when you barely have hair
on your balls, you idol otaku!

69
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,923
What did you say to me?
Aren't you younger than me?

70
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,324
So, have some respect!

71
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,728
Shinpachi, what's that white thing
over there?

72
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,762
What does it look like?

73
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,397
It's toilet paper, obviously.

74
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,367
Not that!
I mean the big thing!

75
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,002
Can you stop saying
perverted stuff like

76
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,237
the "big thing" or
the "little thing" all the time?

77
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,139
You know It's because of
that potty mouth of yours

78
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,742
that Kagura is also
always being so...

79
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,678
What the hell is that?

80
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,113
Someone dropped it outside.

81
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,915
Isn't it just so cute?

82
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,416
Nobody dropped it!

83
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,817
If you're gonna pick
something up,

84
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,220
at least make it something
that we know the name of!

85
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,121
Sadaharu.

86
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,189
You just named it that!

87
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,790
You totally made
that name up just now!

88
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,459
By the way, this was stuck
to his collar.

89
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,228
Let's see.

90
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,230
"To Odd Jobs Gin.

91
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,898
I am very sorry
about doing this,

92
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,767
but can you please
take care of my pet?"

93
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,469
So is that all it says?

94
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,005
Then it says, "L. O. L."
in parenthesis.

95
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,174
L.O.L. my ass!

96
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,343
I'm "M. A. D." in parenthesis!

97
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,112
In other words, that thing
was abandoned at our door!

98
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,782
We may do odd jobs, but we're not
some kind of charity!

99
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:49,683
Get rid of it!

100
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,550
No way, Gin!

101
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,252
If we abandon him
all alone out there

102
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,588
in this cold and heartless
town, then he might die!

103
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,857
Don't you worry
your little head.

104
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,526
I'm sure Sadaharu will be able
to manage on his own.

105
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,095
What do you know
about Sadaharu anyway?

106
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,131
You understand,
don't you, Sadaha...

107
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,723
Oh, just as I expected!

108
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:30,957
Earth is so fun!

109
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,726
Perhaps it's because
of this nice environment,

110
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,262
but there are so many
different living creatures here!

111
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,365
I'm never tire
of coming here, right, G?

112
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,967
I couldn't agree more,
Your Highness.

113
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:47,240
The last time I came to Edo City,
I endured all kinds of terrible abuses!

114
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,381
But this time, I want to check out
all of the zoos in Edo City

115
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,083
to take some unusual creatures
back home with us.

116
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,885
Right, G?

117
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,954
Oh man, what a pain
in the butt.

118
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,089
Did you say something?

119
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,392
No, I didn't say anything at all,
Prince Kaka.

120
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,460
You just called me Prince Kaka.

121
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,896
Who just called him
Prince Kaka?

122
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,531
Was it you?
Was it you?

123
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,066
‐Oh, it was you, wasn't it?!
‐I'm pretty sure that it was you.

124
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,167
Admit it!

125
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,971
This is the Ultra giraffe,
which was found on Nebula M78.

126
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,074
Such a cute creature!

127
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,245
By the way, the Ultra giraffe
eats people.

128
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,349
This is the Iskandar elephant
from the Large Magellanic Clouds.

129
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,519
Oh! This one is very cute too!

130
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,821
By the way, when it
stretches out its trunk...

131
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,890
it eats people too.

132
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,960
This is the petit penguin,
which inhabits Lilliput Planet.

133
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,963
Uh, this one had better
not eaten people.

134
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,633
The petit penguin does not
eat people, Prince.

135
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,836
However, the white polar bear
below does eat people.

136
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,339
Are you trying to have me
killed or what?

137
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,810
<i>Say, Vice Chief Hijikata,</i>

138
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:57,977
why do we have
to be the ones

139
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,347
who are always out here
looking for some animal?

140
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,449
I don't really know, Okita.

141
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,185
But I hear that they're using it
to get on the good side

142
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,387
of some VIP who's visiting
the city of Edo.

143
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,523
Well, if it's to get on
the good side of some VIP

144
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:11,491
we don't even know.

145
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,226
Then, I guess any animal we catch

146
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,328
should be good enough
to please them, am I right?

147
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,796
So, by any animal...

148
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,466
what you are actually
trying to say is...

149
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,001
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Okita?

150
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:25,038
Just doing my duty to suck up
to some visiting VIP.

151
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,540
Do you have a death wish
or something?

152
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,510
So then, can you give me
a good bow‐wow?

153
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,045
Screw you!

154
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,251
What's this?

155
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,655
So the thing is, until we can find
a new owner to adopt him,

156
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,425
I will allow Shigeo to stay
here in our home.

157
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,427
His name isn't Shigeo!

158
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,762
His name's Sadaharu.

159
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,297
But as soon as we find another owner,
I can assure you

160
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,600
that Tatsunori is totally
out of here!

161
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,735
Enough, stop changing it's name!

162
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,004
But look at how cute
Sadaharu is!

163
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,206
How come you don't like him,
Gin, huh?

164
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,411
Because men just can't trust anything
that women say is cute.

165
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,179
Shinpachi, are you like that too?

166
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,516
By day you're a four‐eyed otaku
acting like you're into cutesy girls,

167
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,519
but by night you chase
after sexy loose women?

168
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,587
Who are you calling
a four‐eyed otaku?

169
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,190
‐Anyway, just try petting him!
‐Oh! No, down boy!

170
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,391
‐I'm sure you'll be convinced...
‐I don't want to pet him!

171
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,093
...that he's cute!
Go ahead!

172
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,664
‐So?
‐Get...

173
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,232
get him off of me, Kagura.

174
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,901
This thing is so heavy!

175
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,603
So now you understand
how heavy my heart feels?

176
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,772
No, that's not
what he meant, Kagura.

177
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,508
Being loved is
a very heavy burden, indeed.

178
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,745
But don't worry, because Sadaharu
and I will be okay!

179
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,581
I... I can't breathe.

180
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,550
I think the chocolate pastry
I just ate

181
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,653
is about to be squeezed out
of both ends of my body.

182
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,623
<i>‐No, no! I'm not into that!</i>
<i>‐No, enough of that!</i>

183
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,425
‐Stop, it hurts!
‐No, no!

184
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,330
Can't they chill for
one freaking minute...

185
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,336
Hey, you stupid punks!

186
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,338
Quit tearing the place apart!

187
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:06,773
Kagura, hey!

188
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,541
You need to discipline him
with training!

189
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:09,976
I don't mind if he misbehaves.

190
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,445
He can grow naturally
and learn naturally!

191
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,748
You two misbehaving is going to
end up with people dying naturally!

192
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,918
What just happened, Gin?

193
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,621
That Sadaharu just went and
squeezed out a number one

194
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,723
right on top of the comic
that I was reading!

195
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,625
Squeezed out a number one?

196
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,293
I'm so proud of you!

197
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,831
He also squeezed out
a huge number two

198
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,467
right on top of
Otsu's debut album!

199
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,370
Otsu, featuring
Sadaharu's Number 2!

200
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:42,609
Sadaharu, you are going
to pay for...!

201
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,745
<i>‐Sorry.</i>
<i>‐Sorry about that.</i>

202
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,449
Hello.

203
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,385
Hell must have frozen over
if you're here.

204
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,587
I'm not lending you any money.

205
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,022
That's not it.

206
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,525
I just came here
to pay you the rent.

207
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,728
What kind of prank is this?

208
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,063
There must be a hidden camera
somewhere in here.

209
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,199
It's nothing like that!

210
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,636
I just thought that at least
I'd pay you this month's rent, ah?

211
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,276
I guess the heat must've
gotten to your head.

212
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,477
Hey, hold it!

213
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,745
Come on!
Come on!

214
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,214
This is that famous dog
Clifford's second cousin!

215
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,216
He should be worth
at least a month's rent!

216
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,919
I don’t want it even if
it’s Lassie’s brother!

217
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,588
Wait for me!

218
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,529
Okay, here's the plan.

219
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,131
While Kagura is taking a nap,

220
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,301
we'll go look for another owner
to adopt Sadaharu ourselves.

221
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,504
Wait, that is the plan?
Are you sure?

222
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,439
Kagura is going to be
very angry with us.

223
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,807
It's all right.

224
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,576
By experiencing harsh reality,

225
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,778
a young girl grows up
to become a lady.

226
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,948
And an idol otaku
graduates from fandom.

227
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,115
What are you talking about?

228
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,317
Are you talking about me?

229
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,785
No way, I'm never graduating!

230
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,687
Okay, let's go!
Hey!

231
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:02,822
Come on, move it!

232
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,524
Let's go, you giant
poop machine!

233
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,295
Good boy, good boy...

234
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,165
This thing should be
around here somewhere.

235
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,234
‐Hijikata.
‐Huh?

236
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,670
What are you doing, Okita?

237
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,570
I think you should
probably watch out.

238
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,570
Huh?

239
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,620
What was that?

240
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,622
It's that guy again?

241
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,329
Sadaharu?

242
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,164
Sadaharu?

243
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,500
He's finally settled down.

244
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,502
So what are we
gonna do now?

245
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,805
I doubt there's anyone around
who would want to adopt Sadaharu.

246
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,108
Don't worry, Shinpachi.

247
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,442
I have an idea.

248
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,178
He squeezed one out again!

249
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,516
This is your idea?

250
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,317
It's my house!

251
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,219
Are you planning to dump
Sadaharu on us?

252
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,620
Oh, you know how it is.

253
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,390
Your sister has been having trouble
with a stalker, right?

254
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,726
Gin, you already took care of that stalker
the other day, remember that?

255
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,928
Real friends help each other
out in times of need.

256
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,730
He'll be the perfect
guard dog for her.

257
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,266
Will you just listen to me,
damn it?

258
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,934
Will you stop biting?

259
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,404
Oh! What exactly are you two
doing out here?

260
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,775
Sheesh! Where did Sadaharu
and Gin run off to?

261
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,879
So, you think that you could
take this dog off our hands?

262
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,349
We already have one useless
adolescent boy living in this house.

263
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:39,052
So, for us to take in one more,
I'm not so sure.

264
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,154
Was "useless" really
necessary to say?

265
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,257
Besides, sis, this is a dog
we're talking about!

266
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,660
Look, seriously, please!

267
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,163
Even if Sadaharu is saying
that he wants to stay here.

268
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,598
What do you mean
he wants to stay here?

269
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:53,966
Damn!

270
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,036
Taking him away
behind my back?

271
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,272
No, no, no!
You've got it all wrong.

272
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,108
‐This is for Sadaharu's sake.
‐You are terrible, Gin!

273
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,447
<i>‐Oh, come on.</i>
‐Oh my!

274
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,248
I think that he likes you
quite a lot.

275
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,866
Sadaharu!

276
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,835
Come and chase me, boy!

277
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,705
Geez, they get along
like milk and cookies,

278
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,041
and it makes you want
to smile, huh, Shinpachi?

279
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:35,942
Yeah, sure.

280
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,712
I guess girls and big goofy dogs
are a match made in heaven.

281
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,286
I wonder why that dog
just won't take to us?

282
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,555
It knows that we're trying
to get rid of him.

283
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,492
It can tell by
it's animal instinct, Gin.

284
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,661
But why is it so attached
to her, Shinpachi?

285
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,598
It isn't really attached to her, Gin.

286
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,473
It's trying to kill her, but Kagura thinks
that it's just being playful.

287
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,142
Cut it out, silly!

288
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:09,976
I understand.

289
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,678
‐So that's how it is, Shinpachi?
‐Yeah.

290
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,820
At least somebody's having fun.

291
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:22,622
You know what?

292
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,390
I really love animals.

293
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,659
All girls really love
cute things, you know,

294
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,095
so no further explanation is needed.

295
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,331
You call that thing cute?

296
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,700
Of course, it's cute!

297
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,537
This is the first time an animal
has gotten so attached to me!

298
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,206
Oh, Kagura, please realize
what's going on.

299
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,810
I used to have a pet
a long time ago,

300
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,745
Sadaharu No.1.

301
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,217
<i>Sadaharu No.1 was really cute,</i>
<i>and I just loved him so much.</i>

302
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,720
<i>I kept Sadaharu No.1 outside,</i>

303
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:58,224
<i>but one night I really,</i>
<i>really wanted to sleep with him,</i>

304
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,993
<i>so I snuggled with him in my bed</i>
<i>without telling my parents.</i>

305
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:05,031
<i>But then, I had a nightmare and</i>
<i>thrashed around all night long.</i>

306
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,737
<i>It was terrible, and when</i>
<i>I finally woke up,</i>

307
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,373
<i>Sadaharu was as stiff as a rock.</i>

308
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,647
<i>I don't know if I'm supposed</i>
<i>to be laughing or crying at this.</i>

309
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:26,619
<i>After that happened, I swore I'd never</i>
<i>get close to animals ever again.</i>

310
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:30,656
<i>I'm not good at controlling my strength,</i>
<i>so I only end up hurting them.</i>

311
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,160
But maybe, if it's Sadaharu,

312
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,963
he and I can be together
without anyone getting hurt.

313
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,698
He is a gift from the heavens.

314
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,801
‐I'm sure of it, cute dog.
‐Oh!

315
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,605
Oh, I forgot that I'm all out
of pickled seaweed.

316
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,106
I'm gonna go and buy some.

317
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,109
Take care of Sadaharu for me!
Be right back!

318
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,613
Hey, come back here!

319
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,490
Hey, Sadaharu!
Stop it!

320
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,759
‐Gin, Gin, Gin, help!
‐Wait!

321
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,461
Gin, help me!

322
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,862
Help me, Gin!

323
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,164
And I'm saved!

324
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,073
He looks cute when
he's sleeping like that though.

325
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,376
He's a demon
in a dog's clothing.

326
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,046
We're living in a crazy world
with vicious dogs.

327
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,115
We have to keep
a grip on our sanity.

328
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,817
But after seeing
how much Kagura loves it,

329
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,153
I feel kinda bad
for how things are going.

330
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,522
Oh, so there you are.

331
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,258
Oh, it's you guys again.

332
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:40,192
What do you want now?

333
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,061
Don't you have a day job to do?

334
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,063
Are you looking for
some play date or something?

335
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,731
As if I'd ever invite you out!

336
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,967
Inviting you to a fight
is more like it!

337
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,002
You remember the last fight
that you picked with me?

338
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,305
Well, you just turned tail
and ran away.

339
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,906
Bring it on, sucker!

340
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,510
Let me send you to a hospital,
but with no tails or legs.

341
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,447
By the way, Bossman...

342
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,683
is that your giant dog
over there?

343
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,385
No, it's not really my giant dog.

344
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,987
But why are you asking?

345
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,089
Who said you could change
the subject, huh?

346
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,925
Listen, there's a certain someone
connected to the government big shots

347
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,227
who's interested
in animals like that.

348
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,464
We would like you to hand
that dog over to the Shinsengumi.

349
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,265
Forget it, man.

350
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,300
I wouldn't give it
to guys like you.

351
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:25,037
You can tell your big shots that I don't
work alongside the Shinsengumi.

352
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,441
Stop acting like
I'm not standing right here!

353
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,146
Oh, damn!

354
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,881
What will we do, Okita?

355
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,151
I think you'll just going to have to learn
how to say, "bow‐wow" after all.

356
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,519
Oh, shut up!

357
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:44,523
Hey Gin, did you refuse them
for Kagura's sake?

358
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,325
As if I would.

359
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,790
I just don't like being told
what to do by those guys.

360
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,790
Huh?

361
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,790
Whoa!

362
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,254
Oh, It's so hard to find an animal
that really catches my fancy.

363
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,890
Every one of them is lacking
in some way or another.

364
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,825
I couldn't agree more,
Your Highness.

365
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,261
Isn't there anything
that can be done?

366
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,466
Look out!

367
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,300
G!

368
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,240
What have you done?

369
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,475
Please calm down, my Prince!

370
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,378
I shall go and find us a time machine
to fix this for starters.

371
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,614
G, will you just calm down?!

372
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,183
Oh my!

373
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,185
What is this here?

374
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,586
What's the matter, my Prince?

375
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,255
Hey, G, look at this!

376
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,723
Did you find
a time machine to fix this?

377
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,925
No, you stupid old geezer!

378
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,527
This is a Dog God!

379
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,429
What is such a rare
species doing here?

380
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,764
‐Well, do you have any rope?
‐Huh?

381
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,267
Should we be doing this,
my Prince?

382
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,469
We're behaving like
common criminals here.

383
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,837
It's called conservation!

384
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,206
I can't allow such a precious
specimen to run wild!

385
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,208
‐All right, let's go!
‐Sure!

386
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,345
<i>I've finally added an animal</i>
<i>to my collection!</i>

387
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,719
<i>Doo doo dooo dee doodoo...</i>

388
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,458
Sadaharu!

389
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:30,963
The last time I was here, I had a horrible
time with that silver haired man

390
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,731
and that weirdly strong girl.

391
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:36,102
But this will finally ease the pain
of losing my darling Pesu.

392
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,236
Right, G?

393
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,438
I couldn't agree more, your...

394
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,108
A zombie man!

395
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,044
Hey, could you stop
the car, moron?

396
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,246
I... It's you from the last time!

397
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:48,948
I gave it a lot of thought,

398
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,817
but I can't let you
have this thing after all.

399
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,786
This thing...

400
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,288
She's really taken
a mad liking to it.

401
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,456
What are you
blabbering on about?

402
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,224
Move it!

403
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,626
I can't see a thing in
front of me, damn it!

404
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,499
What?

405
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,269
What's the matter?

406
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,239
A weird girl is approaching
at tremendous speed!

407
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,407
Give Sadaharu back!

408
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,543
Who the heck is Sadaharu?

409
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,779
Stay back!

410
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,054
I forgot that Sadaharu...

411
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,490
was on the car.

412
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,329
Sadaharu!

413
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:55,915
I have...

414
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,817
I have gone
and done it again.

415
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,818
I did it all over again.

416
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,791
Excuse me, miss.

417
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,599
Why are you looking
so glum, Kagura?

418
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,368
Oh, Gin and Sadaharu!

419
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,541
Sadaharu!

420
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,344
Sadaharu, I'm so glad!

421
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:28,113
I'm so... so glad
that you're safe!

422
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,486
But Gin, you were so
against keeping him before.

423
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,055
Whatever, Kagura.

424
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,857
But if you're gonna keep it,
you take care of it.

425
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:41,060
I'll be deducting
the cost of his food

426
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,795
from your salary though!

427
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,532
Thank you so much, Gintoki.

428
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,169
Though you've never
actually paid me my salary.

429
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,574
Let's not come back
to Earth anymore.

430
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,810
I couldn't agree more,
Your Highness.

431
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,387
Remember to say bow‐wow,
Chief Kondo.

432
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,250
<i>You want us to find a poster girl</i>
<i>from a dumpling shop?</i>

433
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,152
<i>Heh! And you're telling me</i>
<i>it's been fifty years?</i>

434
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,120
<i>Listen, pops.</i>

435
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,357
<i>Even if we do find her, her poster</i>
<i>girl days will have been long over!</i>

436
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,791
<i>The next episode...</i>
