1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:02,402
Keep the room well‐lit...

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,071
and watch from a distance!

3
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,697
Kaguraaaaaaaa!

4
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:41,702
Kagura!

5
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,236
Hey!
Wake up!

6
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,509
Did you just sit there and watch?

7
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,447
Did you bastards just sit
there and watch?

8
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,582
I'm asking you if you
just sat there...

9
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,517
and watched my daughter
bled out...

10
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,420
after she put her own life
on the line to save yours.

11
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:01,955
W‐W‐Wait there!

12
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,225
It's not like we could call a doctor
in this kind of situation, right, G?

13
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,126
Don't include me!

14
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:06,960
I don't know anything!

15
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,562
As of today have dementia!

16
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,230
Damn you!

17
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,469
Papa, please don't...

18
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,938
I didn't save them just
for you to kill them.

19
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,106
Kagura!

20
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,207
It's okay now!

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,641
Papa's going to take
care of you!

22
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,843
You don't have to worry!

23
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,379
Papa, I have changed,
haven't I?

24
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:29,216
My strength is no longer just
for hurting people anymore...

25
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,386
I have also learned how
to protect people, now.

26
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:33,920
Don't talk anymore!

27
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,590
I have made so many
friends here...

28
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,258
and all because of that...

29
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,395
I'm not alone anymore...

30
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,031
The Yato fought, and fought

31
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,966
and ended up
destroying themselves...

32
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,068
The Yato fought, and fought...

33
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,870
and ended up all alone...

34
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,639
Papa, big brother, everyone...

35
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,742
The ones we really have
to fight are ourselves...

36
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:59,780
Because if we don't, then we will
all end up all alone.

37
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,130
Papa...

38
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:22,803
Kagura!

39
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,439
Kaguraaaa!

40
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,109
<i>Gin...</i>

41
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:31,678
<i>Gin...</i>

42
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,319
Kaguraaaaaaa!

43
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,557
Gin...

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,835
You freaking worm!

45
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,203
Let her go, let her go!

46
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,437
Or I'll piss on you!

47
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,406
I'll give you that sweet
warm piss!

48
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,507
Don't do that!

49
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,676
Your you‐know‐what
will swell up!

50
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,144
Didn't your mother...

51
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,313
ever teach you that, huh?

52
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,415
So...

53
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,584
look who's decided to
show up late to the party.

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,786
You've got some nerve
to appear before me.

55
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,388
I just love festivities, you see.

56
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,790
Bonfires, brawls, and aliens

57
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,492
are what Edo City is
famous for, you know?

58
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,659
As if it is!

59
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,528
You're more disturbing than
the damn alien, get lost!

60
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,196
Shut up, because your arm
is missing,

61
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,264
so run your ass
to a hospital!

62
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,766
And you should see
a mental doctor!

63
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,100
It'll take a decade
to set you straight!

64
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,635
You should get your
bald head treated!

65
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:29,970
Although it might be a
little too late for that

66
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,338
burnt hilltop on your head!

67
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,277
Why are you still here?

68
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,446
Go to the hospital
to get your flathead

69
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,247
screwdriver installed
on your arm.

70
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,549
What am I gonna do with
a flathead screwdriver?

71
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,785
I'd rather have a torque
wrench if anything!

72
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,319
Who the hell goes to a hospital...

73
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,355
just because they lost an arm
or two in the first place!

74
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,689
Besides, my left arm's a prosthetic!

75
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,826
Have them make you a prosthetic
head while they're at it, cueball!

76
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,133
Fire!

77
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,202
We've got to stop it
right here right now!

78
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,105
Don't let it get into
the streets of Edo City!

79
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,040
Vice‐chief!

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,643
We're completely destroying
the sky terminal's facilities!

81
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,611
Aren't we going to get into
huge trouble for this?

82
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:12,512
Who cares?

83
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,081
We'll just have to say that
the alien destroyed it.

84
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,716
Did you hear that, viewers?

85
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,919
We've just witnessed a
blatant police cover‐up

86
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,954
of the destruction
by the Shinsengumi!

87
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,663
Look up there, look at that!

88
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,264
The alien is retreating.

89
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,200
We did it!

90
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,001
We defeated the alien foe!

91
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,003
No, we haven't won yet.

92
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,271
Wh‐What's it doing?!

93
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,906
The alien is gathering
around the ship!

94
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,374
What's happening with the alien?

95
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,243
What is going on over there?

96
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,312
Look!
There's someone...!

97
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,314
Right in the middle of the alien!!

98
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,749
There's someone shouting
in the center of the alien!

99
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:51,985
Umibozu?

100
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,853
That's Umibozu, the Exterminator!

101
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,256
‐And that guy!
‐Out of my way!

102
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,524
Or we're gonna piss on you!

103
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,461
Umibozu the Exterminator?

104
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,296
He's more of a monster
than the alien is...

105
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,665
And the bossman's keeping up
with him as well!

106
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:09,436
But we canâ€™t shoot at the alien or
they'll be caught in the crossfire.

107
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,038
Those are...

108
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,173
the government's battleships.

109
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,341
It's Pops!

110
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,142
Old man Matsudaira is here!

111
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,444
The god of destruction!

112
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,145
Katakuriko Matsudaira!

113
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,780
This is very bad,

114
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,116
if Pops takes care of things
there'll be nothing left,

115
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,085
he'll take out the
entire sky terminal!

116
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,806
Looks like the crowds are
finally here to watch the show...

117
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,142
We've just about taken care
of everything here already...

118
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,377
I've got to hand it
to you, punk,

119
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,945
you're pretty good for
an Earthling.

120
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,313
That doesn't sound like
a compliment

121
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,981
when it comes from you,
but thanks, I guess...

122
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,617
I'm amazed you fought
this far with just one arm.

123
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,053
You're only using
one arm yourself!

124
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,255
For your own sake,
go home, or you'll die.

125
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,457
I'd really love to,
but the problem is...

126
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,660
I don't see any emergency exits.

127
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,328
You know, I can't figure you out...

128
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,131
You pushed Kagura away,
so what are you doing here?

129
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,632
Why do all this?

130
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,534
I'd like to know the same thing.

131
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,304
Why in the world did
I come here at all?

132
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,872
Are you...?

133
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,906
Relax...

134
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,675
I'm not planning on
taking such a loudmouthed

135
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,109
brat back home with me...

136
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,745
Of course, I'm not planning
on dying either.

137
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,948
But most importantly, I'm not
planning on letting her die here.

138
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,287
You really are a strange fellow,
aren't you?

139
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,890
I think I understand
why Kagura likes you.

140
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,695
But what can you do
with only one arm?

141
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,663
You only have one arm, too.

142
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,531
No.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,468
‐Together, we've got two!
‐Together, we've got two!

144
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,371
I don't like it one bit,

145
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,573
but I'm going to help you
until we rescue Kagura!

146
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,508
You can thank me
another time, dad.

147
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,609
I see...

148
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,044
Thanks for the assist!

149
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,114
Hey what's that?

150
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,148
There's something coming out...

151
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,483
Hey...
Hey, it's, what...

152
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,488
Wh‐What the hell is that?!

153
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:09,956
The nucleus...

154
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,225
That is the core of the
parasitic alien...

155
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,894
But I've never seen
a nucleus this huge!

156
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,663
It must have absorbed
an excessive amount

157
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,064
of the sky terminal's energy

158
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,632
and grown its way
right out of the ship...

159
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,635
If we smash that,
we'll be able to stop it.

160
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,308
Ka...

161
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,743
Kagura!

162
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,013
Whoa!

163
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:36,816
Hey!

164
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,551
It just swallowed her up!

165
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,619
This is very bad.

166
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,288
We can't finish it off unless
we get her out first!

167
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,058
If we don't, Kagura will die.

168
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,292
<i>Attention!</i>

169
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,496
<i>All civilians in the vicinity</i>
<i>of the sky terminal!</i>

170
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,765
<i>Vacate the area immediately!</i>

171
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,033
<i>We are about to open fire</i>
<i>on the alien!</i>

172
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,668
<i>Vacate immediately!</i>

173
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,803
What?!
What?! What's that?

174
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,304
Pops, wait!

175
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,307
A civilian child has been sucked
into the alien, wait!

176
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,475
Kondo...

177
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,144
Are you weighing the life of
a single civilian

178
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,979
to the same degree of Edo City?

179
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,648
Saving people takes more
balls than killing people,

180
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,683
and if you lose sight
of the bigger picture,

181
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,154
you're going to forfeit your
opportunity to save any lives at all.

182
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,822
Don't be a wussy.

183
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,357
But listen, Pops!

184
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,025
Hey Chief, look, the alien!

185
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,060
Damn it!
It's on the move again.

186
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,362
You see what I mean?

187
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,764
That's what happens when you
don't listen to Pops, huh?

188
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,766
Pops is generally right about
everything, you know?

189
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,036
80 percent of my body is
composed of correctness.

190
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,404
So on that note,

191
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,572
<i>you two should go on</i>
<i>home!</i>

192
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:33,940
<i>Because you...</i>

193
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,542
<i>are in my way!</i>

194
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,177
You go...

195
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,246
This place will soon
be a sea of flames.

196
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,314
You're not...

197
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,049
thinking of doing
this alone, right?

198
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,618
Turns out I'm just a
loser in the end...

199
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,355
They call me the strongest man
in the galaxy...

200
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,357
but I can't protect a damn thing...

201
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,359
Not even my family...

202
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,462
and not even my one
and only daughter....

203
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,864
<i>The Yato fought, and fought...</i>

204
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,365
<i>and ended up all alone...</i>

205
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,069
<i>The ones we really have to</i>
<i>fight are ourselves.</i>

206
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,206
<i>Because if we don't, then we'll</i>
<i>all end up all alone.</i>

207
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,209
This must be the price I have to
pay for running away...

208
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,044
I'm sorry, Kagura...

209
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,080
At least let me die together
with you, my child.

210
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,451
You know, this is why...

211
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,621
all little girls grow up to detest
their fathers, huh?

212
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,524
Look here, dad..

213
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,327
can't you just bring yourself
to trust your own kid?

214
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:29,629
Do you really think
she's so weak

215
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,264
that she could be
killed by this thing?

216
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:32,799
Listen...

217
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,968
give me five minutes,
delay their attack...

218
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,903
I'm not asking you
to believe in me...

219
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:38,872
But...

220
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,441
At least you can believe
in Kagura.

221
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,510
What are you
planning to do?

222
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,683
<i>What a crazy thing to do...</i>

223
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,469
What are we gonna
do now, Kondo?

224
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,106
Ready the Matsudaira‐Blaster!

225
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,575
‐But Commissioner!
‐I don't care...

226
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,743
‐No, it's not that...
‐just fire.

227
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,177
Please just...

228
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,078
take a look...

229
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,346
They didn't evacuate.

230
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,748
There are more of them.

231
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:22,615
What?

232
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,651
You dumb‐asses!
Do you see this guy

233
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,552
all we have over here?

234
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,788
If you shoot now, this Prince Caca
will also be blown to bits!

235
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,590
And It'll be a big diplomatic issue!

236
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,026
Just wait five damn minutes,
you dumb bastards!

237
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,361
What difference could
five minutes make?!

238
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,129
Seriously!

239
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,730
Just go make yourself
some instant noodle

240
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,831
while you wait for five minutes!

241
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:39,532
Why?

242
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,733
Why are you guys...

243
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,069
Well, we do owe that little
girl after all.

244
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,038
They won't shoot, will they?

245
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,739
We'll be all right, won't we?

246
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:47,874
That darn mop top!

247
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:48,908
If he was coming...

248
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,144
he should have at least said
so in the first place!

249
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,013
Well, I knew he was
coming, anyway...

250
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,615
I knew that he would.

251
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,984
<i>I have changed...</i>

252
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,352
<i>haven't I?</i>

253
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:01,621
<i>My strength...</i>

254
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,291
<i>is no longer just for hurting</i>
<i>people anymore...</i>

255
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,660
<i>I've also learned how...</i>

256
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,330
<i>to protect people, now...</i>

257
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,366
<i>‐Kagura...</i>
<i>‐I'm not alone anymore.</i>

258
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,267
<i>Kagura...</i>

259
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,369
<i>Wake up...</i>

260
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,007
Gi...

261
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,175
Gin...

262
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,610
Wake up...

263
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,812
or I'm gonna eat all your
pickled seaweed!

264
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,117
Commissioner...

265
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,385
He's really a prince!!

266
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,820
He's the real Prince Hata...

267
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,388
What's he doing down there?

268
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,522
Oh, is this it?

269
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,058
Is this the Matsudaira‐blaster button?

270
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,828
Yes it is, but we have to rescue
him before things escalate...

271
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,197
Did you just push it?

272
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,932
You're kidding!
Did you just push it?!

273
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,135
Yeah, well I have to be at my
daughter's birthday party at five.

274
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,137
What?!
We have to stop it!

275
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,171
It can't be stopped!

276
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,072
Hold on!

277
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,340
Doesn't it kinda look like
there're about to shoot us?

278
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,643
You're kidding, right?
I am a prince, you know!

279
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,444
This is very bad.
We've gotta get outta here!

280
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,181
That's my pickled seaweed!

281
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,684
Kagura!

282
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,519
What did you do?

283
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,424
Man, that kid sure has
a thing for food!

284
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,393
I wonder what kind of parents
she was raised by?

285
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,294
I'd also like to know how the hell...

286
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,397
you were raised to be such
a wreckless guy!

287
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,432
They say a man
grows up by himself

288
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,601
as soon as he starts growing
hair down below.

289
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,202
You're not wrong!

290
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,104
Now, I think it's about time.

291
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,206
Let's finish the job.

292
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,008
Let's do it, dad.

293
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,410
Who are you calling "dad"?!

294
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,050
Look!

295
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,184
The alien is...

296
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,118
Wait a sec, Pops!

297
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,353
There's no need to shoot!

298
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,454
Just Waaaaaaait!

299
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,522
A date?!

300
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:43,556
Who are you kidding?

301
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,158
Kuriko is still far too young.

302
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,593
She said she wants to celebrate her
birthday with her friends.

303
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,128
But I bet it's a date with
her boyfriend.

304
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,164
I will absolutely not allow that.

305
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,832
I'll do everything I can to stop it.

306
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,435
I'll even dance the Lambada
on top of her birthday cake.

307
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,136
<i>I'm not talking about a date!</i>

308
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:57,870
I said wait!

309
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,106
<i>Can't you think of anything</i>
<i>other than your daughter, man?</i>

310
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,174
<i>Shut up!</i>

311
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,342
<i>And besides, I can't stop it now,</i>
<i>anyway.</i>

312
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,811
<i>Hurry up and get out of there!</i>

313
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,946
<i>I'm not taking responsibility</i>
<i>for anything</i>

314
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,481
<i>that might happen</i>
<i>to you down there!</i>

315
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,117
Run?
Where are we supposed to go?

316
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,186
My glasses, my glasses,
my glasses...

317
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,120
Go up. GoUp!

318
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,956
Give me back
my pickled seaweed!

319
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,494
Kagura, pull yourself together.

320
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,829
Stop it, you're bleeding...

321
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:24,964
<i>She's not fully conscious,</i>

322
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,266
<i>but</i> <i>she</i> <i>broke</i> <i>through</i> <i>the</i>
<i>nucleus</i> <i>in</i> <i>this</i> <i>condition</i>

323
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:28,501
<i>You're telling me...</i>

324
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,437
<i>this man's voice reached into the</i>
<i>depths of Kagura's subconscious.</i>

325
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:32,739
Oh!

326
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:33,973
It's a pickled seaweed.

327
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,848
What have you done to Papa's
precious pickled seaweed!

328
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,382
Hey!
What're you eating?!

329
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,851
Spit it out!
You'll go bald!

330
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,319
You'll go bald
if you eat that!

331
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,056
What's that sound?

332
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:07,807
Confirmed.

333
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,308
Target has been destroyed.

334
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,549
Oh my dear God...

335
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,384
Those guys...

336
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,852
they must be...

337
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,964
How is that possible?

338
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,034
He blocked that attack...

339
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,304
With nothing but an umbrella?!

340
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,574
Mr. Baldy!

341
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,410
Looks like I got a bit fired
up myself!

342
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,479
Your hair is also a
bit fired up, man...

343
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,749
Who would have thought
I'd die saving someone else?

344
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,518
H‐Hey!

345
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,487
Mr. Baldy!

346
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,688
Hey!
Hey, Baldy!

347
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,824
Bal...
I mean, Mr. Baldy!

348
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:58,925
Baldy...

349
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,326
<i>Your right side is all...</i>

350
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,261
<i>baldy!</i>

351
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,153
At one point, I really thought
it was the end...

352
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,156
but I fought with my
exceptional kar‐atay skills,

353
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,824
and it really was
no match for me.

354
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,359
So...

355
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,428
What're we going to do with this
mountain of a corpse?

356
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,631
The sky terminal will be out of
service for a while as well.

357
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,499
No telling what the officials
are going to say

358
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,134
thanks to that damn old fart...

359
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,037
He was really was a monster
just like the rumors said.

360
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,407
I'm talking about Umibozu,
the Exterminator.

361
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,543
To tell the truth, I was way
more scared of him

362
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,378
than I was scared of the alien.

363
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:53,779
Really?

364
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,816
He didn't look like a monster
to me at all, Hijikata...

365
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,086
He just looked like
any old father,

366
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,021
scrambling to protect
his daughter...

367
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,423
A father having trouble
with his daughter,

368
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,825
just like any other
around here...

369
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,528
I hope Umibozu the Exterminator...

370
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,230
found what he came looking for.

371
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,966
Hey.
How's Kagura?

372
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,068
She's being treated
by the rescue team.

373
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,603
Her injury was pretty serious.

374
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,605
Shouldn't you go get treated
for your own?

375
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,576
I told you, my left arm is a
prosthetic to begin with.

376
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,244
I just need to order a new one.

377
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,213
I'm not talking about your arm,
but your head.

378
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,180
What do you mean?

379
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,348
You know what I mean.

380
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,050
Oh, is that what you mean?

381
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,518
You want me to kill you?

382
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,656
Now, I'm missing not only my arm,
but the rest of my hair, too...

383
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,491
It'll grow back in time.

384
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:39,792
Arms don't grow back.

385
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,661
Not your arm, your hair.

386
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,496
I see, my hair, eh?

387
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,865
Listen, all you ever do
is talk about my hair.

388
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,000
You want me to kill you?

389
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,568
But you know,

390
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,638
both of them remind me of
an important lesson in life.

391
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:54,907
A lesson in life?

392
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:58,110
The thing is, I lost my arm
to one of my kids,

393
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,613
It wasn't Kagura...

394
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,715
I have another older kid...

395
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,618
<i>He was bad to the bone,</i>
<i>well no...</i>

396
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,320
<i>not really bad...</i>

397
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,355
<i>let's just say he</i>
<i>inherited the blood</i>

398
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,890
<i>of the Yato Clan thoroughly.</i>

399
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,293
<i>He was like the embodiment</i>
<i>of the fight or flight response...</i>

400
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,128
A long time ago,
the Yato clan

401
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,631
had a terrible custom
called the "Parenticides."

402
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,367
It was a savage practice
where a person's worth...

403
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,137
was determined by surpassing
their parents through death,

404
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,741
although these days, that practice
has mostly disappeared,

405
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,310
<i>but he actually tried to</i>
<i>carry it out...</i>

406
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,046
He tried to take the head...

407
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,949
of the legendary Umibozu.

408
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,553
Are you surprised?

409
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,121
That's what we Yato are like...

410
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,624
When it happened,
I suddenly realized,

411
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,626
that I wasn't trying to stop
my son who was after my head,

412
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,428
I was instinctively
trying to kill him.

413
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,867
<i>If Kagura hadn't stopped me,</i>

414
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,435
<i>I would have murdered</i>
<i>my son for sure...</i>

415
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,405
<i>Even now, I can't forget</i>
<i>the fear in her eyes,</i>

416
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,207
<i>and after that, I couldn't</i>
<i>go back home...</i>

417
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,576
So I ran away...

418
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,179
I was afraid that Kagura would
one day seek my life as well,

419
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,750
and I was overwhelmed with
the fear that if she ever did,

420
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:14,654
I may not be able to suppress
the monster inside of me...

421
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,590
I didn't have the courage
to change...

422
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,192
<i>or to trust myself,</i>
<i>so I ran away...</i>

423
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,663
<i>leaving young Kagura and</i>
<i>her dying mother behind...</i>

424
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,333
<i>I was afraid of destroying</i>
<i>my family, but in the end,</i>

425
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,869
<i>there was nothing left of</i>
<i>my family anyway...</i>

426
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,140
I came all this way,
because I didn't want Kagura

427
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,475
to go through the same suffering
that I did...

428
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:40,146
But I was about to make
the same mistake as before...

429
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,182
<i>When you told me,</i>
<i>it hit me...</i>

430
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,584
<i>It was Kagura who</i>
<i>stopped me then,</i>

431
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,853
<i>and it was always Kagura</i>
<i>who supported me...</i>

432
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:52,425
<i>That's how she is, and yet</i>
<i>I couldn't even trust her one bit...</i>

433
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,895
I thought I saw myself in Kagura.

434
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,863
But Kagura and I are different...

435
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,332
She is...

436
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,735
<i>She's a lot stronger than I am.</i>

437
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,841
Yes, we are very different...

438
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,744
And I've only just realized that...

439
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,780
I'm, I'm a total failure as a father...

440
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,383
Maybe I'm the only one
who thinks I'm her father.

441
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,819
Maybe she doesn't even think
of me as one at all.

442
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,290
‐Hm?
‐Check this out...

443
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,492
She was always writing
them secretly...

444
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,727
And since you had
no permanent address,

445
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,863
they were always
sent back to my place...

446
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,466
I secretly kept them all
in my closet

447
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,701
hoping I get the chance
to hand them to you.

448
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,970
This is the only one
I have right now.

449
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:38,938
But don't worry,

450
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,440
I'm not the type do anything
as intrusive as to read them...

451
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,044
I figure you're also not the type
to be sobbing after reading this...

452
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,347
‐See you later.
‐Hey!

453
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,050
I don't know all of the details...

454
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:52,885
but...

455
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,820
If you have a parent
who cares about you

456
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,188
what more do you need?

457
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,125
I wish I had one...

458
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,427
A family like the one you have.

459
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,195
You do?

460
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,797
Ironic, isn't it?

461
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,333
How only the people who
don't have something

462
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,468
understand how important
that thing really is...

463
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:12,571
So then...

464
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:13,906
cherish her...

465
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,474
Remember that always.

466
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:27,953
Let me make this clear...

467
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,955
I am staying at the
Odd Jobs for good...

468
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,224
You can think
of me as your family.

469
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,564
But didn't he say
that he was quitting?

470
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,967
Cherish her, huh?

471
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,873
Hey!
Are you listening, Kagura?

472
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,043
Due to certain circumstances,

473
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,512
Papa is going to cherish you
from now on...

474
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,716
So then, take care of yourself.

475
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,219
Papa!
Why?

476
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,587
But wait, Papa!

477
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:07,326
<i>Dear Papa...</i>

478
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,062
<i>I haven't seen you in a while...</i>

479
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,096
<i>Are you doing well?</i>

480
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,531
<i>I'm doing fine...</i>

481
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,433
<i>Right now,</i>

482
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,535
<i>I am living in a city called Edo</i>

483
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,238
<i>with</i> <i>some</i> <i>strange</i> <i>people</i> <i>who</i>
<i>call</i> <i>themselves</i> <i>samurai...</i>

484
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,574
<i>They are truly strange creatures...</i>

485
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:26,745
<i>Even though they're usually all weak,</i>
<i>hopeless and pathetic,</i>

486
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,681
<i>when it really counts,</i>

487
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,983
<i>they draw out their inner strength</i>
<i>through the teaching</i>

488
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,652
<i>of an ideology called</i>
<i>"the way of the Samurai"</i>

489
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,688
<i>and become tough,</i>
<i>noble warriors...</i>

490
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,923
<i>We're all the same,</i>
<i>Yato or Samurai...</i>

491
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,793
<i>We're all fighting</i>
<i>against ourselves...</i>

492
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,330
<i>I think if I can stay here,</i>
<i>I can change...</i>

493
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,767
<i>I think I can become a person</i>
<i>who doesn't give in to herself...</i>

494
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,437
<i>And if I am able to change...</i>

495
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,807
<i>Papa,</i> <i>I</i> <i>want</i> <i>you</i> <i>to</i> <i>take</i> <i>me</i>
<i>with</i> <i>you</i> <i>on</i> <i>your</i> <i>travels...</i>

496
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,544
<i>My dream is to travel through</i>
<i>the universe with you...</i>

497
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,714
<i>and become the best alien buster</i>
<i>in the whole galaxy...</i>

498
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:03,883
<i>Love, Kagura.</i>

499
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:08,554
I'll be waiting...

500
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,322
Kagura.

501
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:48,787
<i>In the next episode,</i>

502
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,390
<i>now that Kagura is</i>
<i>gone, I'll be the heroine!</i>
