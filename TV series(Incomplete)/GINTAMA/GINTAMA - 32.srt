1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,578
<i>For crying out loud...</i>

2
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,180
<i>It's been two weeks already...</i>

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,414
<i>since he left...</i>

4
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,150
<i>I wonder where that idiot</i>
<i>wandered off to, huh?</i>

5
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,908
Okay, Yamazaki.

6
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,209
Um...

7
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,011
How do you read this name here?

8
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,279
It is Sagaru.

9
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,914
Sagaru Yamazaki.

10
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,315
<i>Yes.</i>

11
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,250
<i>My name is Sagaru Yamazaki...</i>

12
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,954
<i>I'm</i> <i>a</i> <i>spy</i> <i>from</i> <i>the</i> <i>Shinsengumi,</i>
<i>the</i> <i>elite</i> <i>police</i> <i>force.</i>

13
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,225
<i>So</i> <i>why</i> <i>did</i> <i>I</i> <i>come</i> <i>here</i> <i>to</i> <i>this</i>
<i>factory</i> <i>for</i> <i>a</i> <i>job</i> <i>interview?</i>

14
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,560
Oh, I see.

15
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,261
You lost your job too, huh?

16
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:12,866
This town is full of samurais who
aren't able to find jobs lately.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,302
<i>Of course, I wasn't actually laid off...</i>

18
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,170
<i>I only came here because...</i>

19
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,105
<i>I sensed...</i>

20
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,807
<i>there's</i> <i>something</i> <i>fishy</i> <i>going</i> <i>on</i>
<i>at</i> <i>this</i> <i>factory.</i>

21
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,578
Long ago, I used to carry a
sword around my waist, too...

22
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:26,580
Now look at me...

23
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:30,484
Well, there are a lot of degenerate
samurai just like you working here.

24
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,552
So try to get along with
'em, would you?

25
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,154
Hey.
Everyone...

26
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,123
we've got a newcomer.

27
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:38,892
Hey man!

28
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,336
What?

29
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,038
You're the bossman
from Odd Jobs!

30
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,906
What are you doing
in a place like this?

31
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,508
Hey man, it's me!

32
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,176
Yamazaki of the Shinsengumi.

33
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,477
Actually, due to circumstances,

34
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,080
I've snuck into this place to do
some undercover investigation.

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,781
Hey.

36
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:03,183
Just to let you know, he has
amnesia and can't remember

37
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,685
anything about his past at all.

38
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,186
He has amnesia?

39
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,221
I'm sorry, but that's the case...

40
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,091
You seem to be an old acquaintance,
but I don't remember you...

41
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,959
You are Shinsengumi who?

42
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,661
Do you want me to call you
Shin for short?

43
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,429
Hold on!

44
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,330
I told you that this is an
undercover operation!

45
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,166
Oh, crap.
That was out loud!

46
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,635
Why did you just hit my head?

47
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,403
Are you trying to
bam‐bam‐bam my head

48
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,105
like a tambourine player
or something?

49
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,106
If you don't like Shin,

50
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,408
how about I call you Sheets
since you're undercover?

51
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,876
Are you trying to piss me off?

52
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,244
I told you!
I'm Yamazaki.

53
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,246
Well, I don't remember you,
so I'll call you Tambourino.

54
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,649
You're not even trying to remember
my name, come on, man!

55
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:36,983
Uh...

56
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,019
now that I think of it,
you are acting kind of odd.

57
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,153
Your eyes aren't lifeless...

58
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,888
What, then what happened
to Odd Jobs?

59
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,124
What happened to everyone
else working there?

60
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,526
The Odd Jobs...

61
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,833
Hey, Kagura...

62
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,334
What are you doing
here again?

63
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,036
I told you it's
very dangerous here,

64
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,305
this place could come tumbling
down at any moment...

65
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,973
Come on, let's go home...

66
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,509
Sis and Sadaharu
are waiting for us.

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,818
Will you quit with that noise?

68
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,587
Munch, munch, munch, munch,
munch, munch, munching!

69
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,489
Are you getting ready for
hibernation or something?

70
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,724
What do you plan to do with all that
pickled seaweed you have?

71
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,962
Okay, listen, Kagura...

72
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,198
don't tell me you're planning to
sit here until Gin comes back?

73
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,035
Remember the doctor said...

74
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,704
that a person's memory...

75
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,106
is like several
intertwined branches, remember?

76
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,276
So then, if one of the
branches is moved, then,

77
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,378
the others will start
to move around too...

78
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,883
But the thing is, if that tree
is already dead...

79
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:47,154
Then, its branches may have all
fallen off and been lost already...

80
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,056
And if that is the case,
Gin won't remember...

81
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,792
little twigs like us.

82
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,894
The tree hasn't died...

83
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,996
And I won't let it die.

84
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,331
We may be just a couple
of little twigs,

85
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,034
but if the branches manage
to break off,

86
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,702
then the tree really will die...

87
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,072
So then I'm not going to break.

88
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,708
Even if winter comes and
the leaves fall off.

89
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,845
Even if the wind blows and all
the other branches break off,

90
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,481
I'll be the last branch clinging
onto the tree!!

91
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,951
I'll stick with the tree
until the very end!

92
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,488
Oh.

93
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,829
He'd damn well better
come back soon.

94
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,097
If he doesn't hurry...

95
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:34,901
our crap's gonna start turning green
from eating all this seaweed.

96
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,940
Hey, I don't remember saying
that you could eat that!

97
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,909
Well, well, well...

98
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,346
I thought I finally got rid of all the
noisy idiots, but you are still here.

99
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,050
Listen, considering everything.

100
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,419
I want to tear down the second floor
as soon as possible.

101
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,521
I can't have you two sitting
around here forever.

102
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,622
Wait, Otose!

103
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:58,425
I promise you, we're going
to bring back Gin for sure.

104
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,293
How are you going
to bring him back?

105
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,963
You don't even know
where he is these days!

106
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,199
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,935
I heard that a man with silver hair...

108
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,705
is living and working in this factory
called Viper...

109
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,341
Go bring him back immediately.

110
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:18,979
I don't care for the idiot...

111
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,947
but he still owes me rent, remember?

112
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,984
Hey! What are you doing, you idiot?

113
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,720
If one person on the assembly
line makes a mistake,

114
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,488
then the whole line has to stop!

115
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:29,990
S‐Sorry, boss.

116
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,192
Sorry won't cut it, understand?

117
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,194
Stop making me repeat myself.

118
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,662
What the hell is wrong with you?!

119
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:36,863
It's like this!

120
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,199
You just stick this here and
then you put this on top!

121
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,600
What's the problem?

122
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,972
Okay, boss, but...

123
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,374
what exactly are we making?

124
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,276
I mean what does
this factory produce?

125
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,377
It's obvious, man.

126
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,112
They're Justaway,
don't you see?

127
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,948
I'm asking you what the hell
a "Justaway" is!

128
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,317
A Justaway is a Justaway,
and nothing else.

129
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,619
Nothing more,
and nothing less, alright!

130
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,688
But this is just a piece of junk!

131
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,658
How am I supposed to keep my
motivation up while looking at this!

132
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,328
All you have to do is empty your mind
and move your hands, alright.

133
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:09,963
Check out Sakata.

134
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,268
Wow!
He's incredibly fast!

135
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,603
That's our Mr. Sakata!

136
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,873
He makes Justaways so quickly
that you can't even see 'em!

137
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,709
At this rate, he's definitely going
to be the next foreman!

138
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,244
Everyone, follow his lead!

139
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,912
‐All right!
‐All right!

140
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,947
This place is totally doomed!

141
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,417
They choose a foreman by how fast
you can make this junk?

142
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,200
No, I still haven't found anything
here at the factory.

143
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,401
Yes...

144
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,370
Really?
All right then.

145
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,038
I'll head back to
headquarters right away...

146
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,608
Bossman, listen,
I'm checking out of here.

147
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,311
Apparently Chief Kondo
has gone missing.

148
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,880
Dishwater, you can't abandon your
Justaways like that.

149
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,916
Nobody's born a
prodigy when it comes to this,

150
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,517
it's practice that makes perfect!

151
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,086
Who the hell is Dishwater?

152
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,088
Are you trying to say
that I'm dull or what?

153
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,623
I told you I'm only here
to investigate this place!

154
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,695
I think you should leave this place
as soon as possible too, bossman.

155
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,597
I've heard a bunch of bad rumors,

156
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,833
about the foreman
going around, you know...

157
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,402
<i>Outwardly, he's a kind hearted guy</i>

158
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:25,105
<i>who takes care of jobless</i>
<i>samurai who havenowhere to go...</i>

159
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,408
<i>But it's rumored that his true</i>
<i>motives lie in gathering fighters</i>

160
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,910
<i>to carry out his plan to</i>
<i>overthrow the government...</i>

161
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,546
<i>I also hear that this factory</i>

162
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,349
<i>is secretly building weapons</i>
<i>to arm the rebels...</i>

163
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,752
<i>and that he's preparing a</i>
<i>weapon of mass destruction</i>

164
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,821
<i>to bring about world of chaos</i>
<i>in the near future...</i>

165
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,757
<i>Although, in the end.</i>

166
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,092
Well, this is the only thing
I found out about him...

167
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,062
But as they say, "where's
there's smoke, there's fire."

168
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,364
Are you saying..
that Pop's an erowrist?

169
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,499
Stop accusing him...

170
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,733
of being an erowrist!

171
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,468
Pop's s a savior who takes
even the likes of me in!

172
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,270
What are you saying,
I mean, what's with...

173
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,238
the Ero‐wrist?

174
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,739
Is it an erotic wrist?

175
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,642
Anyway, what the hell happened
to you, bossman?

176
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,112
The thing is, I don't want to go back
to being the irresponsible man I was.

177
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,948
I have decided to
completely relive my life.

178
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,150
Bossman...

179
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,752
Is that so?

180
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,587
Then, I'm a little
disappointed in you...

181
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:18,324
I mean, you always came off as a
very irresponsible guy to me...

182
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,692
but it seemed like Chief Kondo

183
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,195
and Captain Okita saw
something in you anyway.

184
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,363
Mr. Sakata...

185
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,964
work is about to start.

186
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,166
Okay, well...

187
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,367
I'm going now.

188
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,970
Mr. Sakata, could you look at my
Justaway for just a minute?

189
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,672
What do you think of it?

190
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:37,510
Well, honestly, I think you should raise
this up just a little bit, Mr. Gori.

191
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,013
What the hell are you doing here?

192
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,748
Mr. Gori!

193
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,250
Hello?
I found the missing idiot.

194
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,453
Yes. I'm taking him back
right away.

195
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,121
Mr. Gori, get a hold of yourself!

196
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,190
Dishwater, what the hell
was that for?

197
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,293
Mr. Gori is suffering from
amnesia just like I am!

198
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,329
You have to be gentle with his
head or he's likely going to crash.

199
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,531
His brain's like a video game
from the eighties!

200
00:09:58,698 --> 00:09:59,933
He has amnesia?

201
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,167
Are you for real, Chief?

202
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,402
How can an idiot like you

203
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,038
get yourself into such a
complicated situation?

204
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,339
You're such an idiot!

205
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,841
That's enough, Dishwater.

206
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,610
Idiots, in their own idiotic way,
have their own idiotic problems!

207
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,880
Shut up, I'm sick of all this,
you two are such a pain!

208
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,181
Come on, Chief,
we're going home!

209
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,015
Let's go!

210
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:16,916
No way, man!

211
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,585
I have decided to become
the number one

212
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,687
Justaway craftsman in Edo City!

213
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,790
I promised Pops that I was going to
become number one in something.

214
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,793
Then don't worry, because you're
the number one idiot in the world.

215
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:27,861
Come on.
Hurry up!

216
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,395
No way!
No way!

217
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,839
Ahhhh!
It's an explosion!

218
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,843
Tell us, Foreman, did a Justaway
accidentally go off?

219
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,112
Who is responsible for this?

220
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,751
No way!
The Justaway exploded!!

221
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:52,819
No way!

222
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,421
He was making us manufacture
bombs for him?

223
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,656
This is terrible!

224
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,324
Is Pops really behind all of this?

225
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,027
He griped a lot about losing his job
because of the government...

226
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,263
but really?
Of course it's him!

227
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,532
The factory has all the
necessary ingredients!

228
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,567
It's like the hottest restaurant
in town for terrorists!

229
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,369
But it's not the
Justaway's fault!

230
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,970
It's only Pop's fault.

231
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,906
The Justaways haven't
done anything wrong.

232
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,674
The hell?!?
Are you still carrying those?

233
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,142
Get rid of them right away!!

234
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,411
You damn bastards!

235
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,880
How dare you ruin all
of my well‐laid plans!

236
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,049
I'm going to slaughter you spies!

237
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,385
Oh no!
Pops is headed right this way!

238
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,986
Dishwater, this way!

239
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,559
I won't let you get awaaaaay!

240
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,231
Oh crap!

241
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,232
Hey!

242
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,800
I thought you said you
couldn't fight him!

243
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,835
But you definitely did
a very good job!

244
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,637
Did I really say that, Mr. Gori?

245
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,839
It's no good.
I can't remember.

246
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,007
I have amnesia now.

247
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,176
What a convenient
type of amnesia!

248
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,882
Don't move a muscle...

249
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,617
It's really too bad...

250
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,654
Though I may not look it, I used to
chase crooks as a police officer.

251
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,623
They called me Banzo the Viper...

252
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,558
You got me pretty good...

253
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,195
It didn't even cross my mind that you
might be from the government.

254
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,332
I was so close to being able
to teach everyone a lesson...

255
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,702
But now that the cat
is out of the bag,

256
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,204
I guess I have to work
with what I've got!

257
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,943
All right, everyone,
please step back.

258
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,778
It's dangerous, and you'll
end up like him.

259
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,513
He's got a poker face,
but trust me...

260
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,383
he's really hurt and embarrassed
on the inside right now.

261
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,585
Hell of a mess this turned
out to be.

262
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,387
You're quite a mess right now,
too, Hijikata.

263
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,590
I wonder if Yamazaki's gotten
caught up in this and died.

264
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,293
I'll bet you're going to die, too,
Hijikata.

265
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,227
Vice‐chief!

266
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,230
I hate to inform you but we just
got word that the Chief

267
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,832
is in there with Yamazaki.

268
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,233
What's that now?

269
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,403
Come on. I was going to leave
if it was just Yamazaki,

270
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,872
but it's a different story if
Kondo's in there too.

271
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,173
Hijikata.

272
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,844
I forgot my flute at home, so I'm
going to go back there and fetch it.

273
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:58,544
Sure.

274
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,146
And don't ever come back...

275
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,849
Jeez.
You're all so pathetic...

276
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,450
Forget it, I'll go by myself.

277
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,885
You all wait here.

278
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,320
Hey!!
Look over there!

279
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,955
Something's coming
out of there.

280
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,123
What's that?

281
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,024
A cannon?!

282
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,359
A big‐ass cannon
came out of there!

283
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,963
That must be the weapon
they were secretly building then.

284
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,900
Okita, I forgot my protractor, so I'm
going to go and fetch it.

285
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:24,570
Hijikata, it's all right because
I have a protractor right here.

286
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,549
<i>October 6th...</i>

287
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,519
<i>My father hit me for the</i>
<i>first time in my life today...</i>

288
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,788
<i>It was a very hard punch...</i>

289
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,222
<i>It was...</i>

290
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,559
<i>a punch from a man who held so</i>
<i>many important responsibilities,</i>

291
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,628
<i>including taking care of his family...</i>

292
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:49,729
<i>and all by himself...</i>

293
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,698
<i>My hand seems so small...</i>

294
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,266
<i>compared to his hand...</i>

295
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,969
<i>My hands are that of a loser</i>
<i>who never held anything but a..</i>

296
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,239
<i>game controller for two years and</i>
<i>three months, since quitting work.</i>

297
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,609
<i>You don't have to try to live</i>
<i>a cool life, you know...</i>

298
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,446
<i>Nothing wrong with having</i>
<i>embarrassing moments</i>

299
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,081
<i>or eating dirt from time to time...</i>

300
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,883
<i>It just means you'll have something</i>
<i>to laugh about over a beer.</i>

301
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,487
<i>As he left for work after saying</i>
<i>these words to me...</i>

302
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,390
<i>his shoulders looked broader</i>
<i>than ever before...</i>

303
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,725
<i>Could I ever hope...</i>

304
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,127
<i>to become as strong as</i>
<i>my father was?</i>

305
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,197
<i>I went outside for the</i>
<i>first time in two years.</i>

306
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,132
<i>I followed my father without thinking...</i>

307
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,300
<i>Banzo the Viper.</i>

308
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,235
<i>That was my father's other name.</i>

309
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,405
<i>The viper, who always made</i>
<i>criminals tremble in fear...</i>

310
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,607
<i>I wanted to see his face.</i>

311
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,177
<i>I wanted to learn the meaning</i>
<i>of the word "work" through him.</i>

312
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,715
<i>But all I saw when I followed him...</i>

313
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,717
<i>was a beaten man killing</i>
<i>time in a park</i>

314
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,086
<i>with a cheap bottle of some</i>
<i>home‐brew in his hands...</i>

315
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,256
<i>The truth is, he was laid off</i>
<i>from work a month ago.</i>

316
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,958
<i>Nooooo!!</i>

317
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,262
You guys will never understand
just how terrible I felt!

318
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,799
How it felt to read my son's diary
after he wrote all this about me!

319
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,535
If I'd kept my job just
a little bit longer,

320
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,570
he would have been able
to straighten out his life!

321
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,372
Instead, my son went
from being a hermit

322
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,507
to becoming a gang member!

323
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:10,042
He's gone from the North Pole
to the South Pole!

324
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,446
That's a great episode to
laugh about over a beer.

325
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,515
I'd choke on it, dumbass!

326
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,250
It's so heavy I can't digest it!

327
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,952
I devoted thirty years of
my life to my country,

328
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:20,887
but the government,

329
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:23,356
and even my family just
dumps me like garbage!

330
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,757
It's just wrong!

331
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,959
There's something terribly
wrong with this world!

332
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,694
So I'm going to change it myself!

333
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,763
I'm going to destroy
this corrupt country

334
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,465
and start a revolution with this!

335
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,535
The Viper Z that I spent
the last ten years making!

336
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,537
It is a corrupt country, alright,

337
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:38,771
but you can't forget about
all of the people

338
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,573
who live here right now, right?

339
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,975
Before you start a revolution
in this country,

340
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,777
why don't you start
one within yourself?

341
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,679
It'll be a lot less trouble
in the long run.

342
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,416
Shut up, because you'll never be
able to understand how I feel!

343
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,618
Ready the cannon.

344
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,455
No, not like that, you idiot...

345
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,591
Why are you acting surprised?!

346
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,193
I'm the one who
should be surprised!

347
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,761
Vice‐chief!!
Isn't that...

348
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,596
Chief Kondo!

349
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:04,797
Yamazaki!

350
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,699
Why is that guy there, too?

351
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,337
I know that these loser spies
are with you lot...

352
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,006
Shoot the cannon if you
want to stop me,

353
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,108
but they'll be blown to bits, too.

354
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,312
Okita!

355
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,881
Long ago, Kondo once said...

356
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,083
that if he was ever captured
by an enemy,

357
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,219
that I should shoot
without hesitation...

358
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,387
I think he said that, anyway.
Maybe.

359
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,923
You fired based on your memories
about what he might have said?

360
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:31,958
They fired at us!

361
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,826
They literally fired at us!

362
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,561
Who the hell are
those people, dishwater?

363
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,331
I thought you said that they
were your friends, man!

364
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,233
Those bastards down there?
They're not my friends!

365
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,934
Hey Chief, I'm going to
quit the Shinsengumi!

366
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,035
I'm resigning!

367
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,303
Hey, where's the Chief?

368
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,671
Hey.
Over here.

369
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,840
Is everyone safe?
Are you all right?

370
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,309
Hey, Chief, are you all right?

371
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,014
It feels as if I've just awakened
from a long dream.

372
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,550
Uh, Chief, could it be that your
memories have returned?

373
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,718
Uh, your head...!

374
00:16:58,718 --> 00:16:59,619
That's right.

375
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,754
It feels like the fog has
cleared from my mind.

376
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,356
It's very refreshing actually...

377
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,992
Yamazaki, it seems that I caused
you a lot of trouble.

378
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,694
Uh, not really, but, your head...

379
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,129
Well, anyway,
before anything else,

380
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,664
we should focus on getting
out of here.

381
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,531
Let's go...

382
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,066
Hey, Chief!
Wait a second!

383
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,535
The bossman's still...

384
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,303
It's all right.

385
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,838
Go without me,
Dishwater and Mr. Gori.

386
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,107
Get out of here before
they catch you.

387
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,075
Damn!

388
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,846
Normally, I'd just leave you
here to your fate...

389
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,648
but Mr. Sakata has
done no wrong!

390
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,651
Just buy me a cold beer when you
get your memory back.

391
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,552
Mr. Gori...

392
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,254
Hey!
What are you doing?

393
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:40,993
Now, men!
Fire!

394
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:46,799
Foreman!

395
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,801
Use the Viper Z!
FIRE!

396
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,441
Crap!!

397
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,714
<i>Chief!</i>

398
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,663
<i>Chief!</i>

399
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,403
You still alive, you maggots?

400
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,272
That thing is really insane.

401
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,840
It might seriously
have enough power

402
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,308
to wipe out an entire country.

403
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:34,747
Hey, Chief!

404
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,416
Chief, get a hold of yourself!

405
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,417
Chief Kondo!

406
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,752
Chief Kondo!

407
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,487
Chief Kondo!

408
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,223
Behold the power of the Viper Z!

409
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,593
With this, Edo City will be turned to
ashes in the blink of an eye!

410
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,695
Go ahead and stop me
if you think you can!

411
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,164
You pushover officers that just
comply with authority

412
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,000
have no chance against me!

413
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,836
Come on! If you don't hurry,
I'll fire my next shot.

414
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,605
Everyone in the capital
will burn to the ground!

415
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,440
What's wrong?

416
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,808
Are you frozen in fear?

417
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,010
Is that the problem?

418
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,811
How pathetic you are!

419
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,183
If you want to shoot, be our guest.

420
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,220
Yeah, we really don't care if you
fry or boil the city of Edo.

421
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,989
But we can't have you hit
this person right here.

422
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,025
Wh‐Who are you bastards?

423
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,826
This isn't a place for little kids!
Go home.

424
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,361
Do you want to be turned
to ashes?!

425
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,864
But‐ how come?

426
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,232
Why are you both here?

427
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,100
Why did you come all
the way here?

428
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,136
Didn't I tell you two to forget
about me?

429
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,838
I told you you're free to live your life
the way you want to.

430
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,342
You don't have to tell us that.

431
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,811
We are already living
the way that we want to.

432
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:41,013
We came here because
we wanted to.

433
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,348
‐We came here because
‐We came here because

434
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,949
‐we want to be with you.
‐we want to be with you.

435
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:45,484
<i>Why?</i>

436
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:46,852
<i>I don't get it.</i>

437
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,721
I prefer Gin the way
he is now,

438
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,723
compared to that
irresponsible old Gin.

439
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,825
They called me an
irresponsible man.

440
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,627
‐I mean, you always seemed
<i>‐Why am I...</i>

441
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:57,063
like a very irresponsible guy to me.

442
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,065
<i>Why are they all...</i>

443
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:16,816
here.

444
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,298
You kids stay out of this.

445
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,499
Do you want to die?

446
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,701
What do you mean?
You're a kid, too!

447
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,536
What's with you guys today?

448
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,705
I don't like it, but it is our job.

449
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,374
We have to protect
our citizens, after all...

450
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,644
So that's what's up!
If you want to fire, fire on us.

451
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,980
I don't care if it's
Diaper‐A or Piper‐P.

452
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,615
I dare you to fire on us!

453
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,585
That's right. Shoot at us,
you Laid‐off samurai!

454
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,420
Baldy!
Laid‐off baldy!

455
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,021
Since when was I bald, huh?

456
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,223
Alright, fine!

457
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,692
I'll wipe you all out before
I wipe out Edo City!

458
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,227
Yeah, well we'll wipe you out...

459
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,695
before you can wipe us out!

460
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:03,929
Let's go, men!

461
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,065
What are you waiting for?

462
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,000
It hasn't finished charging yet!

463
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:09,502
Use the Justaways!

464
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:11,670
Don't let them get
any closer to us!

465
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,111
Is it ready yet?

466
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,682
Shinpachi, you better have
brought my wooden sword!

467
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,650
Oh...

468
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,751
here!

469
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:29,688
Hey, Foreman!

470
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,825
I'm sorry, but after today I quit!

471
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,293
‐G‐Gin's back!
‐G‐Gin's back!

472
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,995
It seems like I'm better at...

473
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:37,963
being a...

474
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,265
"Jack of All Trades."

475
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,534
Just die, Sakata!

476
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,012
Thank you for
everything bossman.

477
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,013
Let's go home.

478
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,095
It's not right unless those
three are together.

479
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,997
Isn't that right, Chief Kondo?

480
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,401
Who are you people?

481
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,837
<i>G‐Gin's back!!</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>

482
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:32,871
<i>My memory came back,</i>

483
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,907
<i>but the Odd Jobs HQ's</i>
<i>completely destroyed!</i>

484
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,643
<i>The Express Doorstep</i>
<i>Delivery Carpenters?</i>

485
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,510
<i>I never called them!</i>

486
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:39,912
<i>Next, please!</i>

487
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,547
<i>The next episode...</i>
