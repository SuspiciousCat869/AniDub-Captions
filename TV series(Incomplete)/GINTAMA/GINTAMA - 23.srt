1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,704
<i>The wife's name is Sacchan.</i>

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:06,206
<i>And the husband's name is Gintoki.</i>

3
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:07,007
<i>Come again?</i>

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,976
<i>They were two ordinary people,</i>

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,177
<i>‐who had an ordinary romance,</i>
<i>‐Hey!</i>

6
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,279
<i>‐and a perfectly ordinary marriage...</i>
<i>‐Stop making up your own recollection</i>

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,648
<i>‐of the past episode, listen!</i>
<i>‐But one thing was different...</i>

8
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:17,317
<i>‐You're not, even in this episode.</i>
<i>‐the wife Sacchan was a masochist.</i>

9
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,686
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>Is that your punchline?</i>

10
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,222
Whoa!
Look here!

11
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:05,125
Congratulations, because you
have won first prize!

12
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,226
Yes, you have!

13
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,963
<i>Enjoy the ultimate vacation</i>
<i>of your a lifetime dreams...</i>

14
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,833
<i>by flying into outer space.</i>

15
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,868
<i>Come and join the adventure...</i>

16
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,937
<i>where you'll experience a world</i>

17
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,438
<i>you've never seen before.</i>

18
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:22,042
<i>You, too, can experience the</i>
<i>space travel of your dreams.</i>

19
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,277
‐Hey, Gintoki.

20
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,440
Don't you want to go to outer space,
‐at least once in your lifetime?

21
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,449
What are you talking about, man?

22
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,285
There's no air in outer space, you know?

23
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,689
If there's no air, then you'll,
you know, die or something.

24
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,358
Oh, welcome back, Kagura.

25
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,830
Hey, come on, what's this about?

26
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,266
Are you in your rebellious phase, Kagura?

27
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,402
Do you want us to change
your diapers for you?

28
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,837
Kneel before me,
worthless peasants!

29
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,908
I tell you, show me some respect!

30
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,410
You worthless samurai!

31
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,311
Call me "Madame Foreman"!

32
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,315
Wouldn't "Princess queen"
be better, Madame Foreman?

33
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,951
A foreman is more productive
than a Princess queen

34
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,653
and therefore more important!

35
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,356
In fact, call me Madame Slim
and Slender Foreman!

36
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,692
Madame Foreman, did you get
the toilet paper for us?

37
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,128
I forgot to get the butt wiping paper,

38
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,898
but I did get a much better
piece of paper.

39
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,467
A paper that lets us fly!

40
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,503
A trip through outer space,
for up to three people?

41
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,705
Madame Foreman!

42
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,675
‐Hooray!
‐Hooray!

43
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,745
<i>‐Hooray!</i>
<i>‐Hooray!</i>

44
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,080
<i>‐Hooray!</i>
<i>‐Hooray!</i>

45
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,996
<i>All passengers with tickets</i>
<i>for space travel.</i>

46
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,900
Come on, now.

47
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,569
I don't have anything metal on me.

48
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,906
Are these things so sensitive they
respond to people's iron wills now?

49
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,176
There has been an influx in crimes
perpetrated by the Exclusionist Rebels

50
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,845
recently, so please go through again.

51
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,379
Oh, I know what that is!

52
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,083
I forgot about the two balls of steel
I have in between my legs, lady.

53
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:13,520
Listen, sir, please kindly shut the hell
up, or I'll smash your pretty face in.

54
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,423
<i>All passengers with</i>
<i>tickets for space travel,</i>

55
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,091
<i>‐please</i> <i>go</i> <i>through security</i> <i>at</i> <i>this</i> <i>time.</i>
‐ wish I could've brought

56
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,159
my sister along with me.

57
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:23,430
The view of Earth from space
must be so beautiful, right Kagura?

58
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,199
Listen, miss

59
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,136
bringing pets aboard is
strictly prohibited.

60
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,303
But it's not a pet.

61
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,104
It's a hat.

62
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,641
Miss, I'm afraid hats don't pant.

63
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,876
What's that?

64
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,544
It's not a hat!
It's a humidifier.

65
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,180
Your humidifier smells like
rotten meat!

66
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,748
Fine, it's a pet.

67
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,452
Sadaharu won't cause
anyone any trouble,

68
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,787
and he doesn't bite at all, not ever.

69
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,156
I guarantee it.

70
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,223
What's that?

71
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,591
He's doing it now!

72
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,959
He's doing it as we speak!

73
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,127
Hey, sir!

74
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:54,928
Are you all right?

75
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,696
What's this?

76
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,766
I was having such a nice little nap.

77
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,868
Oh, is it already time for the flight?

78
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,937
Wow, my head is really throbbing.

79
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,672
I guess I drank too much yesterday.

80
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,409
No, it's not because of what
you had yesterday

81
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,378
rather, it's because of what
is having you right now.

82
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,947
Wow, I'm totally drenched in sweat.

83
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,615
It's bright red.

84
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:20,153
It must be because
I had tomato juice.

85
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,054
Hey come on!

86
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,956
There's a limit to how positive
a person can be!

87
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,759
I feel really heavy.

88
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,127
This is definitely a hangover.

89
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,296
Hey, sir!

90
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,497
Are you listening to
what I'm saying?

91
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,998
Sadaharu!

92
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,800
What's up with that guy?

93
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,891
A beef or fish?

94
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,125
Beef and fish.

95
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,362
‐What?
‐Beef and fish, I said!

96
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:03,997
So, then, Kagura.

97
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,666
I heard that Sadaharu
got kidnapped

98
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,101
by some strange‐looking dude?

99
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,002
That's right.

100
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,472
I don't think I'll be able to enjoy
the trip anymore now.

101
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,541
One more beef and fish!

102
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,111
That's why I told you to leave him
with the miserable hag.

103
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,080
Can I get a strawberry
milk over here?

104
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,148
Man, our trip's trashed
from the get go.

105
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,151
No, what's really trash
is your character.

106
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,121
I mean I couldn't just leave
Sadaharu behind, could I?

107
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,457
Don't you care about
Sadaharu, too, Gintoki?

108
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,693
Kagura, can you just shut up
while we're on the flight?

109
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,729
Man this really sucks.

110
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,830
Maybe we should just go home.

111
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,133
<i>Passengers, please look out</i>
<i>the window on your left.</i>

112
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,436
<i>What you see is the most beautiful</i>
<i>planet in the Solar System,</i>

113
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,872
<i>our mother planet, Earth.</i>

114
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:46,906
Wow!
It's so pretty!

115
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,008
Yeah.

116
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,310
"Wow", you two?
What happened to "man, this sucks",

117
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,745
you're enjoying this!?

118
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,848
It makes me realize just
how small my problems are.

119
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,816
Yeah, and It really
cleanses your soul.

120
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,285
You don't want
your souls cleansed!

121
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,221
Some stains on your soul are the
only good parts you want to keep!

122
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,555
Good grief.

123
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,092
Don't move.

124
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,508
‐Hijackers!
‐We're being hijacked!

125
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,910
Shut up!
Nobody move!

126
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,046
As of this moment,
our revolutionary forces,

127
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,214
"Burning Fighting Spirit,"
has taken over this ship!

128
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,617
We are going to demand
a ransom for your release

129
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,751
from the government!

130
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,588
How dare you indulge yourselves on
a leisurely trip through space.

131
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,724
The very least you can do
is give up your money

132
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,926
and contribute to
funding our cause!

133
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,263
Anyone who refuses to, or is too
poor to provide us with anything,

134
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,999
‐will be put to death, no questions asked.
‐We've got trouble Gintoki!

135
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,367
‐We do this in the name of the Earth!
‐Hey Gin!

136
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,703
When I die, I think I'd like
a space burial.

137
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,305
I feel like I could
become a star myself.

138
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,740
Yeah, and I'm sure you could!

139
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,574
Hey!

140
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,743
You both really are about
to really turn into stardust!

141
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,012
You there.

142
00:07:59,012 --> 00:07:59,946
What're you doing?

143
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,415
Were you listening at
all to what we said?

144
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,453
Damn you!

145
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:08,788
You're ten years
too young for that!

146
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:10,623
Don't you move!

147
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,525
Take that!

148
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,996
‐Amazing!
‐Bravo, Last Samurai!

149
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,203
That was a really stupid move!

150
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,337
Die!

151
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,947
Man, I feel really awful right now.

152
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,416
I should have taken something
for this freaking hangover.

153
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,552
What's this?
Did something happen?

154
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,787
Sadaharu!

155
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:41,855
You bastard!

156
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,323
What?

157
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,625
Give Sadaharu back to me!

158
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,897
Sadaharu, I'm so glad you're okay!

159
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,065
There, there.

160
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,733
You must've been so scared!

161
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,203
This guy is...

162
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,539
Hey Gin, do you know this guy?

163
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,275
An explosion!

164
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,577
There was explosion in the cockpit!

165
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,112
The pilot and crew are injured!

166
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,682
There's a bomb in the airplane.

167
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,185
It's all over for you guys.

168
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,388
All of you traitors who
welcome the Amanto to Earth

169
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:16,890
deserve to die.

170
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,129
Attention all passengers!

171
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,860
Is there anyone among you
who knows how to pilot a spaceship?

172
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,668
I don't care who, just save us!

173
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,936
I don't want to die!

174
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,140
What are you doing?

175
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,308
What the hell?
Who are you?

176
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,143
Where do you think
you're taking me?

177
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,680
Listen, if I remember correctly,
you love space ships, right?

178
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,981
You can at least pilot one?

179
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,683
But how do you even
know that about me?

180
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,553
I've seen you before.

181
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,056
You're Kintoki!

182
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,158
Yes, you are.
What are you even doing here?

183
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,094
Long time no see, Kintoki!

184
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,995
What a strange place to meet.

185
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,231
Some sake please!

186
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,332
Someone bring us some sake!

187
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,969
Hey pal, my name is Gintoki!

188
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,571
Get it right!

189
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,338
Gintoki!

190
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,606
If my name were Kintoki then,

191
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,608
we take the title of the show,
wouldn't we!

192
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,780
This is the end of the line.

193
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,882
I am the captain after all,

194
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,417
and I'm going down
with my ship.

195
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,718
The earth it...

196
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,854
it seems so far away.

197
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,624
Did I step on something?

198
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,059
Hey, hurry up!

199
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,196
Those guys are really crazy
to set a bomb on a spaceship.

200
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,465
Gintoki, it's not looking good.

201
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,534
Everyone's starting
to sing Amazing Grace.

202
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:35,969
Don't worry, Shinpachi.

203
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,004
Just leave it up to this guy.

204
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,541
He's a total airhead, but he
loves ships more than anyone.

205
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,077
He's even traveled
all across the Galaxy.

206
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,513
To someone like
Tatsuma Sakamoto,

207
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,649
moving a spaceship is just like
moving his own arms and legs.

208
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,452
Okay, we are all set now.

209
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,120
Let's do this!

210
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,723
You're right, nothing's in that head.

211
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:57,857
Hey!

212
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,192
Need me to whack you again?

213
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,063
You see, this is the first time
I've had to pilot a spaceship this big.

214
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,365
I have no idea where to start.

215
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,534
Where's the ship's steering wheel?

216
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,068
Gintoki, is this it?

217
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,904
That certainly is not, Kagura!

218
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,172
Stop abusing the pilot!

219
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,707
I'm so sorry, mister pilot.

220
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,709
<i>Hey, hey, this isn't good.</i>

221
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,511
<i>We're</i> <i>starting</i> <i>to</i> <i>fall</i> <i>towards</i>
<i>that</i> <i>planet</i> <i>down</i> <i>there!</i>

222
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,380
Gintoki, here it is!

223
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,119
It won't budge at all.

224
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,053
Well done, sonny.

225
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,454
Leave the rest to me.

226
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,723
Don't come near me!

227
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,892
I thought you loved spaceships!

228
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,827
But you're totally getting motion sick!

229
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,598
Yeah, I really love spaceships,
but riding in them makes me puke.

230
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,000
What a complicated
love‐hate relationship.

231
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,803
Shinpachi, never mind him,
let me do it!

232
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,673
I wrote an essay about how
my dream is to become a pilot.

233
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,141
You stay out of this, Kagura.

234
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:48,875
I'll do it.

235
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,944
Because I'm sure it's just
driving a mo‐ped!

236
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,478
No way, you two!

237
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,147
If I put my life in your hands,

238
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,415
I wouldn't have enough lives

239
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,383
‐even with unlimited respawns!
‐Hey, hey...

240
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,118
Amateurs shouldn't be
touching the controls.

241
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,955
I think I know how this
scene's gonna turn out.

242
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,657
The three of you fighting over the
wheel is gonna make it snap off.

243
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,426
I've got to prevent
that from happening!

244
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,597
Whoa!

245
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,134
<i>So this is how it turns out!</i>

246
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,003
<i>It's not funny!</i>

247
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,586
<i>I've made up my mind!</i>

248
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,388
<i>I'm going to go into space.</i>

249
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:39,292
<i>If I stay here on Earth, crawling</i>
<i>around and fighting the Amanto,</i>

250
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,327
<i>I</i> <i>know</i> <i>how</i> <i>the</i> <i>future's</i>
<i>going</i> <i>to</i> <i>turn</i> <i>out.</i>

251
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:42,862
<i>Even as we speak...</i>

252
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,331
<i>the</i> <i>Amanto</i> <i>keeps</i>
<i>coming</i> <i>and</i> <i>coming.</i>

253
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,369
<i>We can't fight the tides</i>
<i>of change, can we?</i>

254
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,806
<i>Fighting this war is only sending</i>
<i>our comrades to their deaths.</i>

255
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,744
<i>But I don't want to see any</i>
<i>more of our friends die.</i>

256
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,582
From now on, we've got to look at things
from a different perspective.

257
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,019
<i>A perspective so high,</i>
<i>we can see humans,</i>

258
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,421
Amanto, and the
whole world at once.

259
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,524
That's why I'm going
into outer space.

260
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,260
I'll sail a huge ship through
outer space,

261
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,664
and I'm going to go fly fishing
for all the stars.

262
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,532
How about it, Gintoki?

263
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:23,970
I think it would be a waste for you
to stay cooped up on this tiny planet.

264
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,506
Come on buddy, what are you
to come with me and...

265
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:32,979
Hey, heaven!

266
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,848
Send a meteor down on to
this guy's head, huh?

267
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,854
That was really freaky.

268
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,524
The heat is starting to kill me,
now I think!

269
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:47,694
My whole life was starting
to flash right before my eyes.

270
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,596
Well, at least we managed
to survive the crash.

271
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,432
Survive the crash?

272
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,101
<i>How is this "surviving"</i>
<i>anything, man?</i>

273
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,037
<i>We crashed on a planet whose</i>
<i>entire surface looks like</i>

274
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,272
<i>an old lady's wrinkled butt.</i>

275
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,708
And it's all because you broke
the wheel back there.

276
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,243
Hey I've already forgotten the past.

277
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,713
Men need only look forward
to the future.

278
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,581
Don't play dumb, you hairball!

279
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,518
Oh come on, it's hot enough,
stop getting so heated, guys.

280
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,921
Kagura, are you doing all right?

281
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,155
The sun is strong here.

282
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,457
I'm okay, Shinpachi.

283
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,959
As long as I have my umbrella,
I'll be fine.

284
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,894
But I'm getting really thirsty now,

285
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,864
so I'm gonna go have some
water from that river over there.

286
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,200
River over where?

287
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,769
Wait up!
Don't cross over to the other side!

288
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:35,174
Shinpachi, it ain't about
how hard you hit.

289
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,845
It's about how hard you can get hit,
and keep moving forward.

290
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,580
That's not how drinking is done!

291
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,014
Gintoki, this is bad!

292
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,851
I think Kagura's about
to cross the River Styx here!

293
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,487
I guess I have no choice.

294
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:48,855
I'm just a bum.

295
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,790
Hey!

296
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,458
Pull yourself together, Kagura.

297
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,727
All right, Adrian, I'll win the match.

298
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,329
I'll win the match, I'm ready.

299
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,430
This isn't good.

300
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,698
Her eyes are all glassy.

301
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,367
I'll get her some water
from that river over there.

302
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,336
Wait, now you're seeing a river, too?

303
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,104
What are you saying?

304
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,272
You guys can't see it?

305
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,974
Oh, there's even a flower garden!

306
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,575
Oh, it's Oryou.

307
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,811
‐Marry me, girl.
‐Oh, man!

308
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,312
‐Will you marry me?
‐You man are all hopeless!

309
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,015
What's that?

310
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,857
‐It's a ship!
‐They've come to rescue us!

311
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,160
‐We're saved!
‐They've come to rescue us!

312
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:39,939
Thanks a lot, Mutsu!

313
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,508
So sorry for making you
come out all this way!

314
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,444
And it'll be the last
time I do, Sakamoto.

315
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,481
Our ships are for conducting
merchant business only.

316
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:51,184
We can't have you, our leader,
always getting into trouble.

317
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,886
And, this had better
be the last time that

318
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,788
you go wandering off
without telling us.

319
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,123
Oh, forgive me.

320
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,759
The girls on Planet Earth
are the best, after all!

321
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,961
Oh, I hope your balls
rot off and you die.

322
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,264
I'm no match for a Tom
like you, Mutsu.

323
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,900
Hey, Sakamoto, what are these?

324
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,035
Ah!

325
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,037
They're the "Kaientai" fleet.

326
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,705
I put it together a while ago.

327
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,942
But although it's a fleet,
they're not for battle.

328
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,711
This fleet is my company
for doing business.

329
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:19,879
Your company?

330
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,380
Yeah, that's right.

331
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,549
We use these ships to
engage in big business.

332
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,718
We travel to numerous planets,

333
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,487
buying and selling merchandise
across the galaxy.

334
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,824
But recently, space has
gotten pretty sketchy,

335
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,727
so as a self‐protective measure,
we've armed ourselves.

336
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,331
So then, Sakamoto, you're not
just a stupid loser after at all?

337
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,633
Can l go cry now?

338
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,735
It's not military might

339
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,104
nor ideologies
that moves people, it's profit!

340
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,041
Our business bring in profits
for both humans and Amanto.

341
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,010
It helps ease tensions
between the two.

342
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,081
The thing is, I'm trying to protect
our country with my own methods.

343
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,617
Oh, wow!
That's impressive!

344
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,120
Our boss just wanders around
without a goal in mind.

345
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,224
He's a very difficult man
to understand, I know.

346
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,594
But still there's something
very special about him.

347
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,630
Something that attracts everyone.

348
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,367
You too, were drawn to something
he has inside, isn't that right?

349
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,205
I'm really not sure what
it is about him.

350
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,206
But...

351
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,173
What?

352
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,143
What's going on?

353
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,813
I think the heat has
finally gotten to me.

354
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,215
I'm seeing some
very strange things.

355
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,416
Sakamoto!

356
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,817
Don't worry about it.

357
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:32,885
It's just a hallucination.

358
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,020
...but, I don't think...

359
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,823
Don't worry about it.
It's just a hallucination.

360
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:38,991
Sakamoto!

361
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,060
What is that thing?

362
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,128
It's a monster!

363
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,462
What in heaven's name is that?

364
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:44,997
That's a Sand Worm.

365
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,368
It's at the top of the food chain
in this planet's ecosystem.

366
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,070
It's usually docile,

367
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,973
but it must have woken up from
all that commotion we made.

368
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:54,907
Say what?

369
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,175
Now wait just a minute!

370
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,744
How can you be so calm when
your boss is in mortal danger?

371
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:02,281
This is what he gets for
always going off on his own.

372
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:03,883
Hey there, Sand Worm!

373
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,585
Give that mophead
a good beat down!

374
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,154
Especially in between his legs,
if you please!

375
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,221
What's that?

376
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,456
What have you
got against him?

377
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,860
I'm not about to die
in a place like this!

378
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,599
Everybody, get out of here!

379
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,676
Here it comes!

380
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:12,685
That monster!

381
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,720
It's trying to drag the whole
ship down into the sand!

382
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:15,921
What?

383
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,323
Use the cannons!

384
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,991
Send it a greeting
with the cannons!

385
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,427
If we do that, Sakamoto,
you'll be killed, too!

386
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,429
Don't you worry about me!

387
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,032
But no, Sakamoto, no!

388
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,700
Ready the cannons!

389
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:29,935
Ready the cannons!

390
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:31,937
Ready the cannons!

391
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:33,472
Hold on!

392
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,974
Do you want to kill
Sakamoto, or what?

393
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,709
He's supposed to be your boss!

394
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,411
Never lose sight of your duty.

395
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,114
We can't endanger the lives
of all of the passengers

396
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,616
just in order to save him.

397
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,685
Right now, my duty is to save
the lives of the passengers.

398
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,655
He always said
"Never lose sight of your duty."

399
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,926
He's a man who left the
war of the Exclusionists

400
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,394
and his comrades behind,

401
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,530
and then he headed into space.

402
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,332
Why was he able to do that?

403
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,701
For the sake of his duty.

404
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,202
He always looked to the future

405
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,403
beyond the battle in front of him.

406
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,105
And he made the tough
decision to labor.

407
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,109
<i>He did it for the good</i>
<i>of his country,</i>

408
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,845
<i>and we gathered together,</i>
<i>drawn by his vision.</i>

409
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,714
<i>That's why, even now, I cannot</i>
<i>flout his principles.</i>

410
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,783
Cannons are primed and ready!

411
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,586
Fire!

412
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,529
Besides, he's not the kind of guy who
would die from something like this.

413
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:31,797
No, no, no!

414
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,399
I'm telling you, he's gonna die!

415
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,104
No matter how you think
about it, he's going to die!

416
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,943
The Sand Worm is retreating
into the sand!

417
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,678
No! Sakamoto is going to be!

418
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,880
We’ll have to kill it
before it burrows!

419
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,949
Save Sakamoto now!

420
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,422
It's burrowing into the sand...

421
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,858
because you scared it
with all that shooting.

422
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,228
Before you "Do Your Duty",
always remember your manners.

423
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,596
Gintoki!

424
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,131
But where are your
manners then?

425
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:06,966
Sakamoto!

426
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,769
You spun a very good story
about saving the planet,

427
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,403
but is this where it ends?

428
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,405
Were you just all talk then?

429
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,241
Look at me now!

430
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:17,877
I'm living my life...

431
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,912
on my own terms!

432
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:23,716
I see...

433
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,987
I thought if you were with me,
star fishing would be fun.

434
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,355
Sorry about that.

435
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,258
I may not show it all the time,
but I like the Earth.

436
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,761
<i>Go</i> <i>off</i> <i>to</i> <i>space</i> <i>or</i> <i>anywhere</i>
<i>you</i> <i>want,</i> <i>and</i> <i>stir</i> <i>things</i> <i>up.</i>

437
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,831
<i>Fishing for small fries</i>
<i>doesn't suit you.</i>

438
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,734
You're better suited getting
a humongous net

439
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:44,136
to cast into space and snag
a whole planet.

440
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,006
Well then, what're you
going to do now?

441
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,007
Who me?

442
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:49,441
Well, let's see...

443
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,746
I think I'll take it easy and
cast my reel right here.

444
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,615
Maybe I'll catch a shooting star
or something like that.

445
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,417
And then, I'll release
it into the sky.

446
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,557
<i>Oh yeah, that is what he told me.</i>

447
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,995
<i>but who knows what really goes on</i>
<i>inside that guy's silver head.</i>

448
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:11,797
<i>But then...</i>

449
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,399
<i>it's because you stayed</i>

450
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,100
<i>that I was able to go</i>

451
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,570
<i>You stayed down here</i>
<i>on Earth so that...</i>

452
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:22,141
<i>I could move forward into</i>
<i>outer space without looking back.</i>

453
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,009
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

454
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,014
Gintoki?

455
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:33,152
<i>As long as you lift me up</i>
<i>every time I sink.</i>

456
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,221
<i>I'll will be able to keep on flying</i>

457
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,957
<i>forever into the skies.</i>

458
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,394
<i>I can fly!</i>

459
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,066
Look! It's Sakamoto!

460
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,335
Sakamoto is alive down there!

461
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,839
That was very reckless.

462
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,208
It looks like he was almost
swallowed up himself.

463
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,210
What was that insane man
thinking doing that?

464
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,445
You said it.

465
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,013
I wonder what those
two are always thinking.

466
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,582
What were they thinking, you ask,

467
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,484
but the truth is they
weren't thinking at all.

468
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:11,924
I guess...

469
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,860
there's something special
that only they can see.

470
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,058
<i>Good evening! I'm Mopette.</i>

471
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,361
<i>I'm working at a place called</i>
<i>the Girly Boy Club.</i>

472
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,762
<i>Please come visit, everyone!</i>

473
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,997
<i>Wait, why am I doing this?</i>

474
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,532
<i>Hey, Cobra, you too?</i>

475
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:01,867
<i>The next episode…</i>
