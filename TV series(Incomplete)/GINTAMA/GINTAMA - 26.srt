1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,303
<i>Don't sit too close to the screen!</i>

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,105
<i>And keep your lights on!</i>

3
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,830
Hi, how can I help you?

4
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,232
Well, you can start by
putting that away.

5
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,600
Aren't you on the clock?

6
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,970
Why are you stuffing your face
like a damn chipmunk?

7
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,571
Because it tastes really good, sir.

8
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,974
Hey, kid, do I look like a joke to you?

9
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,508
Hey!

10
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,943
You're spilling crumbs in my bag!

11
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,445
Look at that mess!

12
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,379
Hey, manager?

13
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,181
Somebody call the manager!

14
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,850
I'm the manager here today.

15
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:57,884
What's the problem?

16
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,786
What's got you all upset here, dude?

17
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,255
Two big problems that
I'm staring at!

18
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,590
Hey...

19
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,759
that guy seems awfully upset...

20
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,361
What'd you do to get him mad?

21
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,595
No idea.

22
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,998
He's been really cranky ever
since he got here, boss.

23
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,433
Hey! I'm telling you to stop
munching, damn it.

24
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,201
Hey!

25
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,469
We're very sorry, sir.

26
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,005
We're just filling in for today
so we don't really understand

27
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,473
the complicated stuff.

28
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,842
But I'll do my best to finish this
chocolate bar!

29
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,443
You don't have to do your best,

30
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,912
just take that damn chocolate
bar outta your mouth!

31
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,148
Hey!
What are you doing?

32
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,480
‐What are you microwaving?
‐I don't understand the complicated stuff.

33
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,350
But I'll do my very best! Yes, sir!

34
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,653
Do your very best?

35
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,722
You're, you're microwaving my comics!

36
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:36,690
Oh my god!

37
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,225
Something exploded!

38
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,693
Something just exploded!

39
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,627
Look what you've done!

40
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,195
My comics are probably
covered in sauce!

41
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,964
I don't get the complicated stuff,

42
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,766
but the world is a cold place these days

43
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,001
so I thought you could use our
heart‐warming microwave service.

44
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,569
More like heart‐breaking!

45
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:50,537
Hey!

46
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,272
Give me back my money!

47
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,108
This is why I said that this
was a bad idea.

48
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,647
My friend asked me to look
after his convenience store,

49
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,250
but I have some business
I gotta take care of.

50
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,285
Can you cover for me
for just one day?

51
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,820
It's just one day.

52
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,321
Thanks a million!

53
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,325
I'm sure this shop
will go out of business

54
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,361
by the time Hasegawa gets back.

55
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,697
Huh?

56
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,503
What are you doing, man?

57
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,905
Turn around now.

58
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,339
You took something, didn't you?

59
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,374
What's that?

60
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,809
There's no way!

61
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,445
Sh‐Shinpachi?

62
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,846
Tucker, what?

63
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,189
Hachibei Takaya, age sixteen.

64
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,957
Same age as Shinpachi, huh?

65
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,426
You're old enough to know
shoplifting's a crime.

66
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,228
Your Mom would be
ashamed of you!

67
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,130
And besides, what were
you planning to do

68
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,499
with so many bottles of hair
spray in the first place?

69
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,935
You'd look tight even
without all this crap...

70
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,803
Listen, be confident in yourself.

71
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,906
As if I'd use this all on my
own hair, you moptop!

72
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,908
Then what's it for?
Is it for your rice?

73
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,878
Were you planning to put it on
your rice to make it crunchy?

74
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,613
Tucker, man...

75
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,081
why'd you do this?

76
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:12,452
Look Tucker, you didn't used to be
like this when I first met you.

77
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,787
Shut up!

78
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,256
How many years do you think
it's been, Shinpachi?

79
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:19,092
I'm not the same old Tucker
you used to know anymore.

80
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:23,096
Just take me to the police station
or the magistrate or wherever.

81
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,333
If they wanna crucify me and put
my head up on display, fine!

82
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,340
Don't expect me to be grateful to you.

83
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,175
I'll just come back again.

84
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,544
Okay, then I guess I'll just
stop you again.

85
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,814
Sheesh, still the same
goody‐two‐shoes, eh?

86
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,415
Shinpachi.

87
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,787
Hey guys!

88
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,988
Leave Tucker alone!

89
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,757
<i>Whenever I was being bullied</i>
<i>back in grade school...</i>

90
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,927
<i>you and your sister always came</i>
<i>to my rescue and saved me.</i>

91
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,296
‐Shinpachi!
‐Heh!

92
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,797
You wan't some too?

93
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,499
Go ahead and cry loser!

94
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,269
Never!
I'm the son of a samurai!

95
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,039
The hell you think you
buttheads are doing!

96
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,577
<i>Although</i> <i>it</i> <i>was</i> <i>usually</i> <i>just</i> <i>your</i>
<i>sister</i> <i>going</i> <i>Rambo</i> <i>on</i> <i>the</i> <i>bullies.</i>

97
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,180
Brings back old memories.

98
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:17,517
I always thought that you'd be
my friend, no matter what...

99
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,853
Until that day you betrayed me.

100
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,655
Tucker, man, that was...

101
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,257
I don't wanna hear any
excuses from you!

102
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,226
Do you know how much I suffered

103
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,696
because of your half‐assed
attempt at being kind, huh?

104
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,499
Since that day, I...

105
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,501
Whatever.
Forget it.

106
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,370
Thanks to you, I was able
to toughen up a bit.

107
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,806
I'm in a biker gang now.

108
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,674
What?

109
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,610
Have you ever heard of the
gang the"Bulldogs"?

110
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:47,781
I don't need to rely on you or your
sister anymore, I'm strong now.

111
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,620
Sucker from school?

112
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,822
Who's that?
I forgot.

113
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,525
No. It's not Sucker,
it's Tucker, sis.

114
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,560
You really don't remember him?

115
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,729
No, I've left the past behind me.

116
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:06,399
I've chosen to live my life thinking
only about what's ahead of me.

117
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,601
But never mind that.

118
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,936
I brought all of you a treat for lunch.

119
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,205
Gintoki, Kagura,
please help yourselves.

120
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,173
Oh?

121
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,909
Yay!
Thanks big sis!

122
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,412
I tried out a brand
new recipe this time, so...

123
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,014
here you go.

124
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,016
Look!
Rolled omelets.

125
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,719
I'll go and buy some drinks for us!

126
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,554
No, I'll go, you stay here!

127
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,656
This is a convenience store.

128
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,892
You can get all the drinks
that you need right here.

129
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,395
Are you guys weeping in joy?

130
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,796
That's so nice.

131
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,566
Shinpachi, Shinpachi, come here
and have some omelet.

132
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,034
It's really good.

133
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,703
Hey, Shin...?

134
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,071
‐Look, Sis.
‐Hm?

135
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,840
If I'm remembering correctly,

136
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,142
then the Bulldogs are the
most violent biker gang

137
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,510
around here, aren't they?

138
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,246
They fight and steal
without any hesitation.

139
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,448
Oh. Listen, Shin,

140
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,951
why are you so concerned
about Sucker suddenly?

141
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,552
It's Tucker, Sis.

142
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,554
And it's all my fault
that Tucker changed.

143
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,956
I turned my back on him,

144
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,425
I abandoned him when he
was athis deepest point.

145
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,426
Huh?
Oh?

146
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,062
<i>It</i> <i>was</i> <i>long</i> <i>ago,</i> <i>back</i> <i>when</i>
<i>we</i> <i>were</i> <i>in</i> <i>school.</i>

147
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,031
Sh‐Shinpachi, what'll do I do?

148
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,133
I just pooped my pants.

149
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,801
What'll I do, Shin?

150
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,670
Shin, tell me...

151
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,607
Shinpachi, I know you're awake...

152
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,777
Shinpachi, Shinpachi, help me!

153
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,213
Friendships in school are
just like sandcastles.

154
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,815
One small incident,

155
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,284
and everything will fall apart
and get washed away.

156
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,254
Right after that incident,
I didn't go back to school

157
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,722
because of my father's debt.

158
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,924
But I can only imagine...

159
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,726
how hard Tucker's life
must have been...

160
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,795
especially after that
embarrassing moment.

161
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,163
What should I have done?

162
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,831
What should I have
done back then?

163
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,866
How could I have saved Tucker?

164
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,470
Honestly, there's nothing
you could've done.

165
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,871
Nothing at all.

166
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,440
No, that's not true.

167
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,409
Whenever your friend is crying,

168
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,311
a real friend cries alongside him.

169
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,280
Whenever your friend
is feeling worried,

170
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,116
a real friend always feels
worried right alongside him.

171
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,452
Whenever your friend
shits in his pants...

172
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,422
then a real friend should also
shit in his pants, Shinpachi.

173
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,694
True friends are able to share any
pain that the world inflicts...

174
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,764
no matter what, and Shin...

175
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,067
if your friend goes down
the wrong path in life.

176
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,103
Then, you must stop them,

177
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,872
even if it destroys your
friendship in the end.

178
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,608
That's what makes a true
samurai friend.

179
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,593
I'm very sorry, manager,

180
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,528
but I have some
business to take care of.

181
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,496
Please excuse me.

182
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,638
Are you sure he's gonna be alright?

183
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,473
There's no predicting what
kids will do these days,

184
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,076
so don't come crying to me
if something happens to him.

185
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,624
You useless idiot!

186
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,627
Who told you to go and
get regular hair sprays?

187
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,230
I told you, didn't I?

188
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,567
I need super hard hair spray to hold
my hair in place like this!

189
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,568
Right?

190
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,470
I‐I'm sorry, sir...

191
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,872
I ran into a little trouble back there.

192
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:33,940
Oh really?

193
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,642
You begged me to let you
to join the gang,

194
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,144
so I made an exception
for your sorry butt!

195
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,182
But look at this, you can't even run a
simple errand, can you, Sucker!

196
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,051
I guess we'll have to beat
some spirit into you,

197
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,820
to help you grow a pair.

198
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,523
Wh‐What's going on?

199
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,194
Hey, what're you doing?

200
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,864
Wh‐Wha‐‐?

201
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,270
Come on, be a man, enjoy the ride!

202
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,006
Huh?

203
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,416
‐What?
‐Huh?

204
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,186
Wha‐‐what's this?

205
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,955
Who the hell are you?

206
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,157
Who the hell am I, you ask?

207
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,227
Well, you must be an amateur gang
if you don't know who I am.

208
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,929
I am the Captain of the
Otsu Fan Club!

209
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,731
Shinpachi Shimura!

210
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,833
Sh‐Shinpachi.

211
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,401
What are you doing here?

212
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,271
This isn't a place for
a pretty boy like you!

213
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,672
Go home!

214
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,708
Excuse me!

215
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,377
Which one of you is
the boss of this gang?

216
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,612
Huh?

217
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,615
You think our boss would bother
to see a wimp like you, huh!

218
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:49,983
What's with you, kid?

219
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,351
What the hell do you want?

220
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,553
I'm here to take
Hachibei Takaya back.

221
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,156
From this moment on, he is
resigning from the Bulldogs gang,

222
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,959
and he's going to join
the Otsu Fan Club!

223
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,861
I came to get your permission.

224
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,230
Wh‐What're you saying, Shin?

225
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,865
What's the Otsu Fan Club?

226
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,900
The hell?

227
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:07,901
I Look, Tucker.

228
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,736
I've always been just like you, man.

229
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,839
Ever since the poop incident,
I've been sick of my weakness,

230
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,008
and have been aspiring
to become stronger.

231
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,109
But Tucker...

232
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,378
there's no shortcut
to becoming strong.

233
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,147
Dressing up and acting cool
might make you look strong,

234
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,284
but those superficial illusions
of strength will quickly wear off.

235
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:28,021
<i>Joining a gang and hiding behind the</i>
<i>might of some other guy's strength.</i>

236
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,223
<i>Is that the kind of power you want?</i>

237
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,760
Do you really want to be
that lame Tucker?

238
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,395
Listen kid!

239
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:38,298
I feel sorry for you, but this gang
ain't no after school club,

240
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,766
so you can't just say, "I quit."

241
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,968
And expect us to say, "Oh, okay.

242
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,469
Have a nice day!"

243
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,072
Well, in that case, I'll just have
to take him by force.

244
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,209
Hey, don't underestimate us,
you little brat!

245
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,844
What do you think you can
accomplish here on your own!

246
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:53,913
But he's not on his own!

247
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,381
Huh?

248
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,452
Hey Captain,

249
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,355
I can't be bothered working at
some convenience store anymore!

250
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:03,523
Oh!

251
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,992
If it's a fight you want,
it's a fight you're getting!

252
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,995
The Otsu Fan Club Special
Attack Squad...

253
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,797
the "Chihuahuas" has arrived!

254
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,231
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

255
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,633
Now let's get down to business!

256
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,581
Hey.

257
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,749
Oh, no...

258
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,318
my hairline looks a little off today,
doesn't it?

259
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:36,589
Geez, this sucks, what if this wig falls
off while I'm on my ride?

260
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,560
Everything I've worked to achieve
all this time would turn to dust.

261
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,628
Oh...

262
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,196
I damaged my hair too much

263
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:46,833
when I was young with all the
perms and bleaching I did.

264
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,737
I guess I'll just have to glue it on
today.

265
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,272
Hey, Boss!

266
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:54,741
You idiot!!

267
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,142
Always knock when you come in, okay?

268
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,310
S‐Sorry!
But...

269
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,412
there's no door to knock on, sir?

270
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,014
Then go knock on heaven's door.

271
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,215
What do you want?

272
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,950
We've got big trouble, boss!

273
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,286
A bunch of guys just came to
fight and they're crazy strong!

274
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,960
Slash!

275
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,265
What're you idiots doing?

276
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,800
Boss!

277
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,836
I keep telling you, don't try to settle
everything with violence!

278
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:24,804
What's going on here?

279
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,172
What's this all about?

280
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,740
Hey, Boss...

281
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,610
It seems like something's going
on with your hair as well.

282
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,212
Is it really just the four of
you taking on the Bulldogs

283
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,348
that run the streets of Edo City?

284
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:36,849
Just who do you think you are?

285
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:37,650
Huh?

286
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,818
We're the, you know.

287
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,287
The Special Force,
the Special Attack Force.

288
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,722
The Attack Force of, um...

289
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:43,556
what was it called again?

290
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,590
Ummm.

291
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,792
We're the Special.

292
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,492
The...

293
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,827
Special Attack Force...

294
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,262
the Poodles, or something.

295
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,863
Yeah, something like that.

296
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,832
We're the Attack Poodles, that's it!

297
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,001
It's the Chihuahuas, guys.

298
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,270
At least try to remember
your own gang's name!

299
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,604
Oh...
that's right.

300
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,139
Yeeh, we're the Chihuahuas!

301
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,608
With a capital C and
then a bunch of Hs...

302
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,310
so don't mess with us!

303
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,647
Huh, you say "don't mess with us,"
but with a name like that...

304
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,515
I've never even heard
of such a gang.

305
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,050
Well, what do you want?

306
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,752
We're here to take Tucker back!

307
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,888
I won't let you force my friend
to steal hairspray anymore!

308
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,356
Tucker who?

309
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,225
Hey man, Did we have a
Tucker in our team?

310
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,159
Yes.

311
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,462
They mean Takaya, the
one who joined recently.

312
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,430
Okay then?
Where is he?

313
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,932
He is ver there.

314
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,034
Hey!
What're you doing?

315
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,469
Huh?

316
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,070
This is Sucker, then?

317
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,305
My mistake, dude!

318
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,006
Don't mess with me!

319
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,476
How could you make such
a mistake, Kagura?

320
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,878
Well, everyone's got a baguette
on their heads,

321
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,780
so I couldn't tell the difference.

322
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,281
‐Hey!
‐Hey four‐eyes,

323
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,816
are you Takaya's friend?

324
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,284
I get it.

325
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,587
You came here to rehabilitate
your buddy, eh?

326
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:49,522
And I like that.

327
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:50,423
You want that puppy?

328
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,758
Go ahead and take him.

329
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,626
But boss!
You can't be serious!

330
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,660
But, look...

331
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,629
you're going to do
something for me, first.

332
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,564
You see, we have a ceremony

333
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,768
that one has to go through in order
to leave the gang, you know.

334
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,437
But Takaya won't be able to go through
with it by the looks of it.

335
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,940
You guys are gonna go through
with it for him from the looks of it.

336
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,948
The rules are very simple.

337
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,284
You ride motorbikes
to the edge of town,

338
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,553
all the way to the freeway
that's under construction.

339
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,555
If you get there first,

340
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,924
well then, I'll let you take Takaya.

341
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,692
Listen up. Anything goes.

342
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,895
Using weapons, interfering
with the opposing team,

343
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,129
whatever you want.

344
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,831
If I were you, I'd have
one of you drive

345
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,000
while the other one attacks
and obstruct, huh?

346
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,002
But all of you have to race.

347
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,471
We'll have four from
our team as well.

348
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,473
Excuse me, sir.

349
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,409
We only have one scooter
and there are four of us.

350
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,410
Can you spare us one, dude?

351
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,711
Could you please?

352
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,114
Are you really a biker gang?

353
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,017
You're damn right, we are!

354
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,853
We're an environmentally
friendly biker gang, damn it!

355
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,588
I guess we have no choice.

356
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,659
Hey, sis, do you know how
to drive this thing?

357
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,862
A samurai does not concern
himself with petty details, dude.

358
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,163
Hey, Gin.

359
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,265
I really need to pee now!

360
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,367
Then go take a leak somewhere, dude.

361
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,037
That's no way to treat
a lady, you know!

362
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,005
This is gonna be interesting.

363
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,740
Okay, riders get ready!

364
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,543
Get ready, on your mark, get set, and...

365
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,544
Bulldogs!

366
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,028
The fools, here they come!

367
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,030
They have absolutely no idea

368
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,500
that this is a ceremony of blood
designed to punish traitors!

369
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,737
You're all gonna die here!

370
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:46,572
Do it!

371
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,843
Flatten 'em!

372
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,215
Heizo!

373
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,885
Who's gonna die, pink spikey head?

374
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,888
Hey, Gin, I just can't
hold it anymore.

375
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,489
Go ahead and pee, then.

376
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,766
That's the power of our
special slippery oil!

377
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,134
Don't ever get up!

378
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:16,869
Why you lousy...

379
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,107
Wh‐What?!

380
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,708
She just bounced on his head!

381
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,043
Hey, Sis, what are you doing?

382
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,178
You probably just killed Gin back there!

383
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,747
Oh my Gosh.
Hey!

384
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,683
I'm not going to allow
anybody to pass me!

385
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,419
I am the wind!
Born free like the wind!

386
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,120
Yahoo!

387
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,421
What's that?
Hey, sis!

388
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,024
Did you warp into another
dimension or something?

389
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,926
Oh, It feels so good!

390
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,594
If we go two miles faster,

391
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,162
I feel like we
could travel through time!

392
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,063
Come on, sis!

393
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,731
Time travel on your own time, okay?

394
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,900
Grab the handles!
And watch out!

395
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,970
Take that!
You're not going to pass us!

396
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,539
Now taste the might of the Bulldogs!

397
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,977
What the hell are you doing, huh?

398
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,012
I just need to go 2 miles faster,
so get lost!

399
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:00,713
Hey, no!

400
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:01,914
Don't!
Grab the handles!

401
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,083
Oh no, no, no, no, no!

402
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,085
Oh!
My hair!

403
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,057
Ah‐hah!
He's bald!

404
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,525
Hey, Sis, get a hold of yourself!

405
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,527
It's not what you think, it's just a wig!

406
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,928
It wasn't his real hair!

407
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,497
Uhh.
H‐Holy cow!

408
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,432
Did you see what she did?

409
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,533
She just pulled out all my hair,

410
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,134
and now I look like I'm balding!

411
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,736
You ARE bald, boss.

412
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,971
But.. but..
Look,

413
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,906
I heard you wanted
a new exhaust pipe...

414
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,441
Don't worry, boss...

415
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,410
Everyone's known about your hair
situation for a long time now.

416
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,479
It's not news to anyone in the gang,
honestly.

417
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,247
Oh, seriously?

418
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,751
Shinpachi!

419
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,287
Just hang in there a little longer!

420
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,522
Just hang on!

421
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,691
What the hell is this brat?

422
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,794
You think you're the wildest
gang in town!

423
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,063
But y'all ain't crap compared
to a real one!

424
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,165
Now go ahead and show 'em
what we got, Gin!

425
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,036
Who the hell is that?

426
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,237
Oh no!
Poor Gin!

427
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,205
Oh no!

428
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:02,408
This must be because of his drinking
problem, he's aged so quickly!

429
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,442
Definitely not!

430
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,211
You're the only problem here!

431
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,216
You guys would be better
off doing a standup routine

432
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,618
than being a bunch of thugs.

433
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,853
You think so?

434
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,223
That's pretty convincing when it
comes from you, though!

435
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,859
You must be killing all your crowds
with your flying wigs!

436
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:20,826
Why you‐‐!

437
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,994
Gintoki!

438
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,929
Was the girl just a decoy?

439
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,198
You pulled my attention away and...!

440
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,335
I could send you straight to hell
right now with my

441
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,736
Ultimate German Samurai Suplex.

442
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,405
Trust me, we can end this right here.

443
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,541
But I must respect Shinpachi's
samurai spirit, so...

444
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,710
you're going to race
our captain in a duel,

445
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,146
but you have to promise that
it will fair and square!

446
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,414
Shinpachi!

447
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,082
Go show em who's boss!

448
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,217
Right!

449
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,387
Wow, man!

450
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,756
What a bunch of weirdos, aren't they?

451
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:51,691
That's right!

452
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,428
What's the point of rescuing a
completely useless idiot like you?

453
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:58,597
Too bad for them, they're probably
all dead by now.

454
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:04,136
Yeah, nobody's ever survived
the ceremony of blood.

455
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,639
Or maybe they just ran away.

456
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,809
<i>They're probably down</i>
<i>on their knees begging</i>

457
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,777
<i>for forgiveness right about now.</i>

458
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,353
All together, come on!

459
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,337
My hair, where's my hair?

460
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,439
I don't have hair!

461
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:49,949
Hey loser kid, they're sure taking
their sweet old time.

462
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,318
I think they actually
ditched you there!

463
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:53,953
How about that!

464
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:54,820
What do you think?

465
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,224
They're your friends, after all.

466
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,960
They must have run away at
the first sight of danger.

467
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,995
Yup.
Birds of a feather, right?

468
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,764
A loser's friends are bound
to be losers, too!

469
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,601
Hey, look!

470
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,639
What's that?

471
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,079
There's no way, man!

472
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,548
Don't tell me he actually
made it this far!

473
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:23,849
Where's his bike?

474
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,985
Did they actually run all this way?

475
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,186
Not only the bike,

476
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,688
our bossman lost his
wig somewhere too!

477
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,394
Tucker...

478
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,229
I'm just like you, Tucker...

479
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,064
I hated how weak I was...

480
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,333
and all I ever wanted
was to be strong.

481
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,902
And that's why...

482
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,457
You idiot!

483
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,998
Thanks a lot for all that, ass hole.

484
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,366
Do you know what I had to go

485
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,902
through to join that gang
in the first place, huh?

486
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,072
I get that your'e trying to make
amends or something,

487
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,707
but it's way too late for that.

488
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,676
Yeah, yeah.
I get it, man.

489
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,446
Listen, I'm not forgiving you,
not now or ever!

490
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:31,150
So don't ever risk your life like
that again, do you hear me?

491
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,719
Tucker...

492
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,187
You know what...

493
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,390
the gang's leader started going on
about how he was all impressed

494
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,627
with your spirit and wanted to make
you join the gang and shit.

495
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,529
He was such a pain in the ass about it.

496
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:49,101
I told him I couldn't let my friend get
involved in something like this.

497
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,203
Okay, okay.

498
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,705
I hear you.

499
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,679
I'm never going to ask
those jerks for help again.

500
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:32,671
<i>What's this?</i>

501
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,541
Otsu was reborn as a battling diva!

502
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,310
You shouldnâ€™t spread yourself too thin.

503
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,780
My favorite ramen shop decided to try
adding curry to their menu one day.

504
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,382
<i>Within a week, the shop had to close.</i>

505
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,450
<i>The next episode...</i>

506
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,965
Just bring it to me from
any warehouse sales!
