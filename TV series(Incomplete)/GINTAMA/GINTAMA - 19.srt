1
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,407
<i>I'm not going there</i>
<i>even if you cry!</i>

2
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,542
<i>Now come here!</i>

3
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,395
‐Oh, hey.
‐Oh, uh.

4
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,863
So you are here, too?

5
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:10,964
What's the matter?

6
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,132
You're sweating like a pig.

7
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,900
Did you lose?

8
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,304
Eh... uh... it's so hot
today, isn't it?

9
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,539
And I see you're sweating
pretty badly, too.

10
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,707
Did you lose?

11
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:22,609
It's hot!

12
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,277
It is so hot today!

13
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,847
Hey, sun, take a paid
day off, you idiot!

14
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:27,948
I see.

15
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,217
I thought maybe you had
the cold sweats.

16
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,748
Looks like a guy never
comes to any good

17
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,251
if he is trying
to get rich quick, eh?

18
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,888
Money earned through
your own sweat

19
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,857
just naturally seems to stay
in your hands longer.

20
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,262
It would've stayed
longer if I only...

21
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,965
if I only had stopped
right then and there.

22
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,269
Oh, I could've won
if I had stopped right then.

23
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,538
Why didn't I stop
going at that point?

24
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,075
Are you even listening to me?

25
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,178
You know, I used to be
a hopeful kid

26
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,146
with a lot of big dreams.

27
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,582
How would that kid feel
if he saw me now?

28
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,818
A grown up snarfing
an ice pop he bought

29
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,619
with money he scrounged
off the street.

30
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,656
If I'd only stopped earlier...

31
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,726
I could be ordering a whole bunch
of sweet, cold parfaits right now.

32
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,795
If only I had stopped then.

33
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,632
‐Are you even listening to me?
‐Hey.

34
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,168
Hasagawa, listen.

35
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,503
Have you ever heard about

36
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,905
any easy money making
opportunities around here?

37
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,274
Because everyone's so broke,

38
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,143
they're eating ice pops
for three meals.

39
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,011
I can't eat
three ice pops a day.

40
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,314
I'd prefer to be having
Twinkies for lunch.

41
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,149
<i>Hey, stop it, come on.</i>

42
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,418
<i>Oh, you said you were</i>
<i>going to take me</i>

43
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,919
<i>to the beach, remember?</i>

44
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,187
Oh, man.

45
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,889
I want to go to the beach too.

46
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,291
And I already bought
my swimsuit to wear.

47
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:19,693
Oh, man.

48
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:22,095
I want to check out
some bikini's!

49
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,699
Well, if we go
to the beach right now,

50
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,434
we can't swim, silly.

51
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,437
I heard that some mysterious
space creature might appear.

52
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:34,074
I don't know if it's a man eating shark,
a squid or an octopus,

53
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,143
but it's dangerous
and people can't swim.

54
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,878
So they've posted up
a bounty at the beach

55
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,880
for the monster, baby doll.

56
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:44,017
Oh, no, how scary!

57
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,952
This summer we're doing some...

58
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,921
Pole and line fishing for aliens!

59
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,756
Honey, who are these people?

60
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,364
So, are you guys
finally ready?

61
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,598
Then, let's go get them!

62
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,900
‐Yeah!
‐Yeah!

63
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,168
We're not going there for fun!

64
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,502
We are going there to fight!

65
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,337
We're about to battle
the wild waves

66
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,006
just like a real man does.

67
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,608
You guys look like
you're going on a field trip!

68
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,278
The most you can spend
on your snacks is three dollars!

69
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,579
Kids these days
must have a hard time

70
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,181
finding something
that's three dollars!

71
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,649
Do you understand?!

72
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,654
Captain, you can buy
50 Twinkies for that.

73
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,689
Really, 50?
I can buy that many?

74
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,925
Hey, Kagura, your calculation
isn't quite right.

75
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,294
And Hasegawa,
don't get so excited over it!

76
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:30,096
Shin, hey, don't you have
anything to say

77
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,998
about Gin talking
with that stupid outfit on?

78
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,833
Hey, shut up.

79
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,901
I didn't expect anyone
to notice my outfit anyway.

80
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,270
What are you doing here
in the first place, ah?

81
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,873
We're going to the beach
today, aren't we?

82
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,042
Don't make me
repeat myself to you.

83
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,244
We are going to the beach
for work!

84
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,479
We're going to the beach
today, aren't we?

85
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,548
Ah, not again.

86
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:52,652
Hey, listen Gin, talking to a wall
won't do us any good right now.

87
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,454
Let's just go over
to the beach.

88
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,722
What do you mean?

89
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,191
We don't know who's going to try
to beat us over there, man.

90
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,092
What?

91
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,860
We're not going by car?

92
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:02,929
Gin, come on!

93
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,531
Get a car,
with what money?

94
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,400
What? But I stayed up
all night to make...

95
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,102
...this mix tape for the trip.

96
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,604
God, how old are you?

97
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,272
It's not like you're going
on your first drive

98
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,574
after being dateless
for 30 years.

99
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,545
Besides, cassette tape players
aren't built in cars anymore.

100
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,981
I worked really hard to make
"My Best Music" tape.

101
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,015
We don't have time.

102
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,183
‐Let's go.
‐But wait, Gin!

103
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,351
You forgot to get a ticket!

104
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,220
The thing is, we can't even
afford to buy a train ticket.

105
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,855
Can't you understand?

106
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,157
But then, how are we going to...?

107
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,993
We're going to jump the gate,
aren't we?

108
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,894
We have to cheat
on the train fare!

109
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,730
No way, because that's a crime!

110
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,898
How about buying
discount fares at least?

111
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,833
We have no choice then.

112
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,201
We'll just have
to take a taxi.

113
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,037
Hey! Do you have some serious
hearing problems or what?

114
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,006
‐How do we pay?
‐How about this?

115
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,040
I have an idea.

116
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,276
Let's just borrow
one of those up there.

117
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,613
I give up.

118
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,016
I don't think
we'll even get probation.

119
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,550
I don't know what to do.

120
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,052
Oh, well, you guys.

121
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,288
You're all really
such a hopeless bunch.

122
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,356
You should all be
really thankful

123
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,558
at least someone here
has some common sense.

124
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,595
It can't be.
You...

125
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,163
You have money, big sister?

126
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,431
Oh, of course not.

127
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,533
My budget is still
incredibly strapped.

128
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,268
So we need to figure out
how we can get

129
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,936
to the beach
on the cheap, you know?

130
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,655
You sounded like you had
some sort of great idea,

131
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,357
but you're just suggesting
we hitch hike?

132
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,692
I know what to do!

133
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,528
You can stop a car with
a sexy wink, am I right?

134
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:42,595
All right!

135
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,631
My thighs will shoot them down.

136
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,733
Oh, please stop that, Hasegawa.

137
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,469
Our chances are going to go
from low to none at all.

138
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,506
I suppose I have no choice.

139
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,576
First, what you need to do

140
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:59,012
is put both of your hands
on top of your head.

141
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,949
And next, suck in your stomach...

142
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,854
then stoop forward to show off
your ample cleavage.

143
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,562
And now go!

144
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,007
And here we go.

145
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,244
Can you turn up
the air conditioner, please?

146
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,783
Thank you so much for this.

147
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,151
God, are we so lucky

148
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,754
that we just happened
to be going the same way?

149
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,090
Hey, driver, can you play
my mix tape?

150
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,192
Kagura, Kagura, Kagura,
you're hurting me!

151
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,628
Don't move! Your knee is pushing
into my wounds.

152
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,596
We should be treated better

153
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,598
since we put our lives
on the line to stop the car.

154
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,632
It's so hot in here!

155
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,767
Hot and stinky!

156
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,535
You're using way too much
stuff in your hair!

157
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,500
Play "My Best Music"
mix tape now!

158
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,674
You need to stop worrying
about the small stuff, Shin.

159
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,443
Warm liquid is falling on me!

160
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,478
Sadaharu, was that your pee?

161
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,352
‐It stinks! Open the window!
‐"My Best Music"!

162
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,554
‐Air conditioner!
‐Warm liquid is on my leg!

163
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,032
Oh, no!

164
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,635
Man, what a useless car
that was.

165
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,770
So true! I can't believe
there's a car that can't play

166
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,272
a cassette tape
in this day in age!

167
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,440
What a load of crap!

168
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,741
That's not right.

169
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,711
I made such a big effort
to get us a taxi,

170
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,380
but you were all too excited.

171
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,349
You make it sound like
you stopped the car yourself.

172
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,559
No matter how far we walk
there's no ocean in sight.

173
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,127
I feel like we've
at least made it

174
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,796
200 miles in this heat.

175
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,332
Stop complaining
and just keep walking.

176
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,335
Gin, just to let you know, we haven't
even walked three miles yet.

177
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,207
Give me some water.

178
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,877
There's some water in the barrel
that's attached to Sadaharu's neck.

179
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,749
‐This...
‐Oh, yeah.

180
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,184
Raw water isn't healthy,

181
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,886
so I made sure
nobody can drink it.

182
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,387
I can't drink it...

183
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,529
<i>Gi... give me some water.</i>

184
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,901
Do you think you are a boxer who is
cutting to make his weight class?

185
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,237
Because it's not even
funny right now.

186
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,272
Don't you know
that when it's hot,

187
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:42,075
it doesn't do any good
to say how hot it is?

188
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,177
It only makes you
feel even hotter.

189
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,179
That's right.

190
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:49,449
If he can speak out like that,
then he's doing just fine.

191
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,486
But when you start slurring
your words and you fall down...

192
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,391
You're awesome, Hasegawa.

193
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,361
It reminds me of what the president
of some company said

194
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,030
"A man should lean forward
even when falling."

195
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,999
<i>♪Scorching asphalt is hot.♪</i>

196
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,002
<i>♪I really like the aromatic scent</i>
<i>of burning cheeks.♪</i>

197
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,937
It's really hot!

198
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,906
Please help me, please!

199
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,276
Seriously, my cheeks are hot and
it smells like something's burning.

200
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,744
I can't move anymore.

201
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,779
Are you even listening to me?

202
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,917
Oh, there's the beach!

203
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,634
Guys, let's go!

204
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,002
‐Yeah.
‐Yeah.

205
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,035
Oh, an alien, huh?

206
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,737
Someone actually showed up.

207
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,972
Really?

208
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,908
Well, this will be a big help!

209
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,344
Summer is supposed to be
the busiest season, you know,

210
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,980
but we're not getting any customers
because of the alien!

211
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,648
We're really in trouble.

212
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,317
So then, was it you who...

213
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,653
Posted the bounty
on the alien in the water...?

214
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,054
Right...

215
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,856
Yeah, that was me,
that was me.

216
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:40,793
Yeah, but I didn't expect anyone
to come here to collect.

217
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,295
The truth is...

218
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,131
I was actually kind of joking
about it over drinks one night.

219
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,601
So I never thought somebody
would actually come here.

220
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,273
Joking about it
over drinks one night?

221
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,209
Hey man, we're actually
serious about this

222
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,311
because our livelihoods
are on the line.

223
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,547
A man's gotta put his life on
the line even when he's joking

224
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,516
and we're gonna make sure
you keep your end of the deal.

225
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,517
Hey, wait!

226
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,219
Calm down, calm down!

227
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,554
No, don't worry! I'll pay you.
I have money.

228
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,857
I have it all prepared, I swear.

229
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,294
You are a liar!

230
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,064
Your fried noodles
are overcooked.

231
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,400
There's no way a guy
like you has any money.

232
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,436
I bet your life must be as
tasteless as these noodles.

233
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,673
That's right, go ahead
and say it, tasteless.

234
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,277
It's tasteless!

235
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,111
Stop that!

236
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,546
You can't just eat my noodles!

237
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,781
You have to pay
for them first,

238
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,482
and listen, I'm a man
of the sea.

239
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,817
It's true I don't have
any money,

240
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,253
but I can give you something
just as valuable!

241
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:43,656
Yeah? Then, I'm going
to need to see it first.

242
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,792
We'll get rid
of that alien after that.

243
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,434
It's a pretty cool shirt,
though, Gin.

244
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:55,968
Yeah, right.

245
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,104
If my mother had worn
this shirt when I was a teenager,

246
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,239
I would've disowned her
for it, you know.

247
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,910
That shirt is very rare,
and it's not for sale.

248
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,178
Only my staff can wear it.

249
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,080
Now you are all fellow men
of the sea!

250
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,147
So release me now!

251
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,049
Men of sea don't do
this kind of thing!

252
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:10,817
Let me go!

253
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:11,884
Release me right now!

254
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,886
Come on, I'm a man of the sea.
Come on.

255
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,521
Hey, Gin, what are we going
to do now?

256
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,956
Let me go,
I'm a man of the sea!

257
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,858
‐I'm a man of the sea.
‐Okay.

258
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,626
We've got no choice
but to do it.

259
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,262
We have no choice
but to do what?

260
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,933
You've got a deserted beach,
one alien in the water,

261
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,668
and three beach samurai.

262
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,104
Who will protect the beach
if we don't?

263
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,206
When you're down,
how do you pick yourself up?

264
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,577
People fall into two categories,

265
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,612
depending on how
they pick themselves up.

266
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,647
The first kind of person
comforts himself

267
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,083
by seeing somebody
who's worse off than he is.

268
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,055
And then he thinks,

269
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,657
"Hey, at least I'm better off
than that guy."

270
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,327
And then there's the second
kind of person.

271
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,563
He looks at something
much larger than himself

272
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,432
and tries to raise
himself to it.

273
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:02,034
I am one of those who belong
to the second group.

274
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,239
<i>Since the olden days,</i>
<i>whenever I've gotten into trouble,</i>

275
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,907
<i>I always come to the ocean.</i>

276
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,443
<i>It helps me realize</i>
<i>how tiny I am.</i>

277
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,180
<i>I met my first wife, Hatsu,</i>
<i>at the ocean too.</i>

278
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,850
<i>What I'm trying to say is,</i>

279
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,120
it's like the sea is my textbook
and also my teacher.

280
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,424
Everyone has some place
in their heart

281
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,527
where they can fall back
on when they need to.

282
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,996
Even if I just drift
from job to job

283
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,832
my heart will always
belong here, by the sea.

284
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,467
And those jobs are the ways.

285
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,803
I protect that place
where I have always belonged.

286
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,104
It's not about the money.

287
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,639
This job is my calling.

288
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,941
Now do you finally understand...

289
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,277
what my true feelings
are about this?

290
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,451
Are you really serious, sis?

291
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,388
I reached a settlement with
The Beach Community Association.

292
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,790
If we get rid of the alien,
they'll give us something in return.

293
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,292
Hey, hey, please, listen to me.

294
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,327
Then we gotta be fired up
to do this!

295
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,462
‐My... my feelings.
‐Alright, let's go.

296
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,263
Right!

297
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,321
But why do I have
to do this?

298
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,755
Did I do something wrong?

299
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,991
I was just cooking
fried noodles!

300
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,927
Come on, give me a break,
I did nothing wrong!

301
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,195
You guys, come on!

302
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:40,766
Oh, man.

303
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,668
My legs are wrinkly already.

304
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,637
How am I supposed
to run like this

305
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:48,140
when my legs are all soft
and wrinkly like this!

306
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,842
It's not taking the bait.

307
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,546
I'm wondering if the alien is actually
not in this sea anymore.

308
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,749
No, I don't think that's the case.

309
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,484
The alien is still in this sea.

310
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,353
I can feel it.

311
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,458
<i>This alien is prepared</i>
<i>to fight us.</i>

312
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,793
<i>A fight between men.</i>

313
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,229
<i>Breathtaking offense and defense</i>

314
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:13,032
<i>and the fulfillment</i>
<i>of a man's dreams!</i>

315
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,172
<i>The alien must be staying low,</i>

316
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,974
<i>just waiting for the right time!</i>

317
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,343
<i>This alien understands.</i>

318
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,915
You understand how I feel,
don't you?

319
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,656
Miss, do you understand
my feelings?

320
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,658
Yes, I do.

321
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,294
Oh, thank you so much,
Miss...

322
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,434
Would you care to try
one of my omelets?

323
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,536
I made them just this morning.

324
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,704
Go on and try one.

325
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,843
‐I'm not...
‐You can't fight an alien...

326
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,245
...in the sea if you're hungry.

327
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,362
How about another one?

328
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:17,563
Go on and take one.

329
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:20,733
I've had enough.

330
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,636
Miss, do you understand...

331
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,471
how I feel?

332
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,240
I only wish that
I could swim like them.

333
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,813
I see.

334
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,314
You're sensitive to the sun,

335
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,850
so you can't go swimming
in the ocean.

336
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,518
But it's best that
you're not out there.

337
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,387
There's really no need
to hold back.

338
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,189
The alien might appear
at any time.

339
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,290
Are they alright?

340
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:49,161
Oh, well, I guess If they can't listen
to a guy's story

341
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,563
then, maybe they deserve to die.

342
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,700
It must be so nice to swim.

343
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,735
Uhh... hey, Miss?

344
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,336
What are you planning
to do with that?

345
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,338
Where did you even find
that huge thing?

346
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,540
I'd rather just
end their happiness

347
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,909
than have to watch someone
other than me be happy.

348
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,213
Everyone, run away from here!

349
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,581
This girl is really weird!

350
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,449
She's completely crazy!

351
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,156
Shoot! Now it's turned into
a double wammy!

352
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,859
Hey! Run away, you two!

353
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,093
Everybody run!

354
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,194
Double wammy!

355
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,896
You're twice in deep shit!

356
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,065
What's that?

357
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,600
Double panties?

358
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,535
Did he forget
his swim trunks, maybe?

359
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,403
Behind you!

360
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,038
Shinpachi, behind you!

361
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,440
Hey, Miss, you'd better wait
a bit with that rock.

362
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,443
What's that?

363
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,890
It's here!
Seriously!

364
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,324
Like it's right here!

365
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:54,693
Wait, wait, wait!

366
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,562
I can't go any faster!

367
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,698
Wait, Shinpachi!

368
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,834
How come you can
swim so fast?

369
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:02,935
It's not like you!

370
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,737
You're the character
who can't do anything right

371
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,806
except set up my jokes, right?

372
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,509
My eyes are popping out,
my eyes are popping out!

373
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,078
You bastards!

374
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,448
Thanks for treating me
like crap this entire time.

375
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:18,617
But now I'll teach you
to fear a man of the sea!

376
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,052
Aaah... It's coming!

377
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,654
They've teamed up somehow!

378
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,055
Gin! Shinpachi!

379
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:23,956
Kagura, quick!

380
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,124
Hit them back
with that rock.

381
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,025
All right.

382
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,697
Miss, hold on there!
Wait, wait, wait!

383
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,333
I'm on it! Look, I agree that you
should throw this rock,

384
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,468
but not when I'm on it.

385
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,603
There!

386
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,441
Hey, that...

387
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,381
Whoops, my bad.

388
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,621
Hey, is everyone all right?

389
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,102
Eat me if you want to.

390
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,505
Traveling across the oceans
inside your stomach

391
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,140
doesn't sound too bad.

392
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,084
You...

393
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,195
So, that's the story.

394
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,266
And I think he truly understood

395
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,034
just how much
I loved the sea.

396
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,104
It's not about the mind, though.

397
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,140
Men always speak out
with their souls.

398
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,610
His appearance may have been
frightening,

399
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,712
this is true,
but I'm pretty sure

400
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,482
he just wanted to have
some fun with us, you know.

401
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,085
Yeah, I am sure that was it.

402
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,088
And I can tell because only
good people live in the sea.

403
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:06,926
Soaking in the sea,

404
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,662
makes all the dirt and
scum wash away.

405
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,200
All the scum.

406
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,869
There is a huge
bag of scum

407
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,771
pictured in the
newspaper, though.

408
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,009
Whatever, man.

409
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,372
<i>There's a ghost in the</i>
<i>Shinsengumi headquarters?</i>

410
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,141
<i>Don't be silly!</i>

411
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,076
<i>There's no such thing in this world.</i>

412
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,211
<i>Wait. No, no, no, no!</i>
<i>It does exist!</i>

413
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,480
<i>Help me!</i>

414
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:10,449
<i>The next episode ...</i>

415
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,620
<i>Conveyor Belts!</i>

416
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,466
Should I wear a different kimono
every once in a while?
