1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,004
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

2
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,097
<i>‐We're having big sales today!</i>
<i>‐Okay now...</i>

3
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,500
<i>I'm going to test your newly</i>
<i>acquired ninja skills...</i>

4
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,370
This place is commonly known
as the Ninja Street.

5
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,573
And we ninja often use it
for training exercises.

6
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,977
Every ninja active in Edo City
learned the art of becoming a shadow

7
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,244
right on this street.

8
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,879
Yeah, but there's nothing here.

9
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,781
It's just an ordinary shopping street.

10
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,784
Oh, so you think you can become
a ninja at a sports gym?

11
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,119
Go die, you four‐eyed bastard!

12
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,488
Hey! Why are you acting
so sadistic only to me?

13
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,557
I see, the best way
to learn how to hide

14
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:06,326
is to practice in a place
that is filled with people!

15
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,661
Precisely.

16
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,496
So, why are you holding
a plate of curry?

17
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,798
Hey, so what exactly
are we supposed to do here?

18
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,767
Everyone, look over there!

19
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,635
Huh? A bookstore?

20
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,570
Oh, I see.

21
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,472
We must shoplift some books
without being caught...

22
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,307
Listen.

23
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,943
Your test is to go
and buy a porno magazine

24
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,579
without being noticed
by the clerk or the customers.

25
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,247
Say what?
What are you talking about?

26
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,449
What does that have to do
with being a ninja?

27
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,684
This is an actual test,

28
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,353
used even at the
official ninja academy.

29
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,856
Everyone has walked this path
on their journey of growth.

30
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,457
I think you mean
a different kind of growth!

31
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,059
Then, can you do it or not?

32
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:43,497
You must hide all signs of your presence
completely, and, without being noticed,

33
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,999
instantly pick the type
of porno mag you like.

34
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,869
Then, you have to pay
without the cashier noticing you...

35
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,537
and leave as if nothing happened.

36
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,408
So, can you do it?

37
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:57,010
<i>Uh... you really like your S&M.</i>

38
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,112
Is this too much of a task
for you guys?

39
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,649
If that's all I have to do, becoming
a ninja won't be very difficult at all.

40
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,718
Watch me.
It'll be a piece of cake.

41
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,920
I mean, a plate of curry.

42
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,022
Hey, you should leave
your curry behind.

43
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,257
You don't need it!

44
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,526
Don't drop the curry,
you'll die if you spill it!

45
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,062
You can do it, Curry Ninja!

46
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,096
I'll curry back!

47
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,164
Curry back!

48
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,965
You mean hurry back,
not curry back!

49
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,101
What's with this obsession
with curry?

50
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:22,669
He's fast!

51
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,037
Yes, that's quite something.

52
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,206
He's as fast as an actual ninja.

53
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,575
Hey, hey.
He might actually make it.

54
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,013
He... he spilled his curry!

55
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,183
Sorry, captain.

56
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,151
Please take care of the rest!

57
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,422
Curry Ninja!

58
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,460
I told you not to spill the curry!

59
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:47,994
I'd give him a "B."

60
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,198
He had really good speed,
but he couldn't concentrate at all.

61
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,065
Who's next?

62
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,500
I'll go next then!

63
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,003
And I shall avenge Curry Ninja.

64
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,839
You're not old enough
to buy adult magazines,

65
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,407
so go buy a comic book instead.

66
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,675
Wow! She's like a ninja!

67
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:02,909
Totally like a ninja!

68
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,211
She's ready and willing.

69
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,812
She loves this kind of stuff!

70
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,881
Wow! She's really enthusiastic!

71
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,083
Come on!
Go ahead and buy it!

72
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,185
Why is she coming back?

73
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,186
What happened?

74
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:14,921
Is she crying?

75
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,123
Gin...

76
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,558
there was dog poop
on the street.

77
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,060
What do I do?

78
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,728
Captain, don't worry.

79
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,463
I think it's just the curry
that I spilled.

80
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,164
God, it stinks!

81
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:27,501
Don't try to make me feel better
about lying, Curry Ninja.

82
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,102
Wait, i'll give you
a Curry Ninja "L".

83
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,004
I'll give you an "A,"
so calm down, Kagura!

84
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,539
I don't need a sympathy "A", damn it!

85
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,108
That's it! I don't care about
being the captain anymore.

86
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,109
That's enough.

87
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,944
I guess it's all up to me now.

88
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,114
Believe it or not, I used to play ninja
with my friends all the time as a kid.

89
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,649
Good luck to you, Gin!

90
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:46,920
Where did Gin go?

91
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:49,956
That's so cheap!

92
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,758
No it's not, that's a good technique.

93
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,494
It's a special ninja art called
"camouflage in the bin".

94
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,695
I'm so proud of Gin.

95
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:56,563
He's such a gifted thinker.

96
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,932
‐Why are you going so easy on Gin?
‐You're being completely unfair!

97
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,767
What, you got a problem,
Double Curry?

98
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,768
What's "Double Curry?"

99
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,136
I never even wanted
to wear this suit!

100
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,237
Let me tell you something.

101
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,805
That's not made of yellow cloth.

102
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,807
I made it out of a white curtain
that turned yellow.

103
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,543
So you're a "Yellowed Ninja."

104
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:10,644
Bastard, get over here!

105
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,378
I'll tear you apart!

106
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,547
Stop, Yellow!
Listen to your captain!

107
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,115
But, Captain!

108
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:18,251
Why is there even
a garbage bin over here?

109
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,653
Heck if I know.

110
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,057
Well... this is bad, isn't it?

111
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,359
I'm sure it was just
our imagination.

112
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,961
‐No one was actually inside it, right?
‐You're right.

113
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,664
If he was really inside,
he'd be dead by now.

114
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,866
Well... you're up next,
then Shinpachi.

115
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,901
Uh, all right, I'm off then.

116
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,575
‐Say what?
‐Well, uh...

117
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,276
He's quite smooth.

118
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,579
Nobody's noticing him
at all, or rather...

119
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,582
Nobody gives a flying monkey shit
about his existence.

120
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,083
No presence at all...

121
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,384
So then what the heck.

122
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,520
So it doesn't matter whether
you're a ninja or not.

123
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,722
Anybody can pull it off
as long as they're that dull.

124
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,591
<i>‐He really was inside of it...</i>
<i>‐He really was inside of it...</i>

125
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,925
This is so stupid.

126
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,127
I'm actually glad
I didn't give it a try.

127
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,929
This is just, I mean...

128
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,265
I just went to the restroom
and got beat by a punk.

129
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,533
It's true.
Seriously.

130
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,568
Why are you all looking
at me like that?

131
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,073
Oh, so I see...

132
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,110
Katsura has finally made his move.

133
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,847
It seems that he has gathered a force
to help him free that monster.

134
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,217
They'll most likely attack tonight.

135
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,219
Then he fell for it.

136
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,823
He's exactly like a moth
flying into the flame.

137
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,825
The government's primary enemy,

138
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:35,128
the Leader of the exclusionist rebels,
Kotaro Katsura.

139
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:40,433
If I get his head, my position in the
government will be set in stone forever.

140
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,704
I'm counting on you,
Zenzo Hattori.

141
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,872
Let's go...!

142
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:53,446
We are...
The Mighty Kick‐Ass Power Ninjas!

143
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,348
‐Forward!
‐Forward!

144
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,760
You know that they say...

145
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,929
exposing your butt hole in to the moon
light is good for your health.

146
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,799
That's nothing to talk about
while you're on your patrol duty!

147
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,200
I'm being serious.

148
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,936
Usually, the butt hole
isn't exposed to any lights.

149
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,040
Sunlight also works, but apparently
moonlight is even better.

150
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,310
You're saying that just
to deceive me again, aren't you?

151
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,711
I'm being serious.

152
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,314
I heard that Hattori cured
his hemorrhoids that way.

153
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,082
That's enough now!

154
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,919
Katsura could appear somewhere on
the magistrate's property at any minute.

155
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,854
Well, I was trying
to lighten the mood.

156
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:35,855
Damn it!

157
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,023
I have to pee now!

158
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,326
Hey! Really?

159
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,262
That guy never takes
his duties seriously.

160
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,697
Hey, mister moon!

161
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,933
Please cure my hemorrhoids
with your light!

162
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,271
The moon is coming closer.

163
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,313
Sorry, but listen.

164
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,949
You should go see a doctor
to cure your hemorrhoids.

165
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,888
<i>White Ninja! Special ninja art,</i>
<i>"Chameleon Strike"</i>

166
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,359
It stinks!

167
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,160
Hey, what's all this racket?

168
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,496
‐It's an intruder!
‐Hey, stop you!

169
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,598
The light.

170
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,899
I can't see anything.

171
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,369
Oh, that's not good for you.

172
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,204
You need to put on your glasses.

173
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,272
‐What's this? It stinks!
‐What's this? It stinks!

174
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,207
I can't take them off!

175
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,408
Is this natto?!

176
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,946
<i>Four‐eyed Ninja!</i>
<i>Special ninja Art,</i>

177
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,882
<i>I can't see tomorrow</i>
<i>without my glasses!</i>

178
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,851
Whoa! Oh no!!

179
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,786
Am I gonna be
like this forever?

180
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:40,920
No way, man!

181
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,423
Ah, but I might like this,
it feels kinda nice...

182
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,392
Right, this may be
a big hit this year,

183
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,760
natto glasses.

184
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,627
‐Hang on!
‐Hang on!

185
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,595
‐Who are you?
‐Who are you?

186
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,701
<i>Holstein Ninja!</i>
<i>Special Ninja Art.</i>

187
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,004
<i>"Even though I'm in a Holstein</i>
<i>costume, I still look dull."</i>

188
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,375
Really? With such a beautiful
full moon tonight?

189
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,178
Let's take care of them quick
and have a drink under the moon.

190
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,747
I see. Then how about some
moony‐side‐up curry?!

191
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,789
<i>Red Ninja, Hot!</i>
<i>Yellow Ninja, Mild!</i>

192
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,525
<i>Double Curry Ninja,</i>
<i>Special Ninja Art.</i>

193
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,995
<i>"They're like, Throwing Tons</i>
<i>of Curry Uncontrollably."</i>

194
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:23,897
Which way to go?

195
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,065
I see, then.

196
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,033
Instead of carrying out
their plan secretly,

197
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,202
their plan is to put
everything into chaos.

198
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,504
It's a very good plan for amateurs.

199
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,773
But it won't work
for professionals like us...

200
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,809
‐...the Real life ninjas.
‐Damn it!

201
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:36,876
‐Find them!
‐Where did they go?

202
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,178
‐Where did they go?
‐Has anyone seem them?

203
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,879
‐They were right here.
‐We've got to find them.

204
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,048
Gin! Can you move over more?!

205
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,249
My shoulder is sticking out!

206
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,184
It'll get attacked!

207
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,286
‐As for me, I'm completely uncovered!
‐They'll get my shoulder!!

208
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,520
They'll get all of me!

209
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,455
Get out, you guys!

210
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,689
This is for one person only.

211
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,624
I built this by myself, for myself.

212
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,992
Why did you make a brick wall?!

213
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,794
This isn't New York!

214
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,362
If you're complaining, get out!

215
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,498
I'd be happy to hide anywhere,
even in a sewage canal,

216
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,332
as long as I'm with Gin.

217
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,167
Shut up.
There's no space for you either.

218
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,802
What the hell is that stench?!

219
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,304
Don't come near me!

220
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,105
I love it when you talk dirty.

221
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,407
That's what keeps me going!

222
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,242
You really stink!
You smell like natto!

223
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,644
‐Your fingers!
‐Huh? Where's Yellow Curry Ninja?

224
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,346
Hey, what are you doing, Cobra?

225
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,981
My name is not Cobra.
I'm a pine tree!

226
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,282
Idiot! That will never work!

227
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,051
You're completely exposed!

228
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,186
Gin, look over there!

229
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,490
Elizabeth!

230
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,124
Cobra, wait!

231
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,494
Ah, it's the intruder!!
Stop!

232
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,329
Hey, look!
This wall is strange!

233
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,930
‐It's like New York here!
‐Hey!

234
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,505
Cobra! What the hell
are you doing?!

235
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,006
White Ninja!
Everyone!

236
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,407
Are you guys coming with me?

237
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,843
Yeah! They found us
because of you!

238
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,378
I should kill you!

239
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,113
My curry is going to spill!

240
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,348
And then I'm going to die!

241
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,450
Forget about your curry,
just get rid of them!

242
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,384
This is bad.

243
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,052
If we don't do something,
we'll all end up dead.

244
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,688
Sacchan look, don't you have
any useful weapons?

245
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,422
Just leave it to me!

246
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,657
This will slow them down!

247
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,426
Cal... Cal... Trip!!!!

248
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:04,030
Damn it! We can't get
any closer with these.

249
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:09,302
Wow!! You formed a perfect
barrier with those!

250
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,703
It is just as I planned.

251
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,672
The Ninja Caltrop Circle.

252
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,507
My ass! There's one stuck
in your forehead!

253
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,509
‐Take that!
‐Die!

254
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,511
You idiots! That is definitely
not how Caltrops

255
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,213
are supposed to be used
last time I checked!

256
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,324
<i>Magistrate!!</i>

257
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,860
<i>They're breaking through the mechanical</i>
<i>traps, one after another!</i>

258
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,495
<i>At this rate,</i>
<i>they'll be here soon!</i>

259
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,964
Do not fret.

260
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,967
They're yet to arrive
to the final room.

261
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,541
What is this room?

262
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,711
Hey! That's...!

263
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,279
Elizabeth!

264
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,248
No! Don't get any closer!

265
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,521
E‐Elizabeth...

266
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:04,891
Tough luck kid.

267
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,860
Your dear Elizabeth
isn't here anymore.

268
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:09,862
And you are?

269
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,899
Long time no see,
Ayame Sarutobi.

270
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,267
Oh, Zenzo?

271
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,235
Sacchan, what?
You know this guy?

272
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,804
He's a former Spy Agent
of the government.

273
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,138
Zenzo Hattori.

274
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,441
His unparalleled ninja techniques
made him the most feared

275
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,109
among all of the government agents.

276
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,179
I've been working for the boss
here as a free agent.

277
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,815
It's nothing personal, but if you're going
to side with those fools...

278
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,249
I won't show you any mercy.

279
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,152
I hear you're calling yourselves
the Power‐Ninjas or something,

280
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:37,090
but an amateur ninja will never
be able to beat a real ninja,

281
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,658
even if you're samurai.

282
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,298
Because we are
the strongest five ninjas.

283
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,302
I am Goh the Goliath!

284
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,404
I am Arnold Swords‐maker!

285
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,606
I am Rose, the Queen of Thorns!

286
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,608
Spam, the Human Calculator!

287
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,844
The God of War, Zenzo Hattori.

288
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,712
We five are...

289
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,581
‐Free‐Agent Ninja Squad.
‐Free‐Agent Ninja Squad.

290
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,683
‐The Shinobi Five!
‐The Shinobi Five!

291
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,189
Katsura and your Power‐Ninjas.

292
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,091
It's game over for all of you!

293
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,093
All members of the Shinobi Five

294
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,230
used to work for
the government's Spy Agency.

295
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,565
And they're all very good,

296
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:23,002
so you're going to die,
before your beloved Elizabeth.

297
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:24,671
Elizabeth!

298
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,409
Gin!

299
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,825
Where do you think
you're trying to go?

300
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,897
Comic Samurai!

301
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:51,664
Oh Gin!!!

302
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,567
I never thought I would meet you
again in a place like this.

303
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:59,205
Every time I read comics, your face pops
up in my mind, and it's so annoying!

304
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,006
Wait, wait...

305
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,375
Let's see, comic... comic... comic.

306
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,309
Oh, I've got it!

307
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,310
Are you Carl?

308
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,079
I borrowed your comics
but never returned them!

309
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,547
Wait, let me explain myself.

310
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,049
I told you, I'm Hattori.

311
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,523
Hey, you! What?!

312
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,559
Don't tell me you forgot about me!

313
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,994
So, you are Carl,
then, am I right?

314
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,963
I'm Ha‐tto‐ri!

315
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:27,467
I'm sorry, but I'm not exactly
talented at remembering

316
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,068
the face of middle aged men!

317
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,040
If that's the case,
I don't remember you either!

318
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,508
I don't even know who you are!

319
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,544
Then... why are we even fighting?

320
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,281
Shut up!

321
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,752
I don't remember you
but you're getting on my nerves!

322
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,220
Oh, Gin, be careful!

323
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,988
That man is really dangerous.

324
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,857
You're the one
who needs to be careful.

325
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:57,296
Bravo then! The way you move
is just like a true simian.

326
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:01,400
Oh I'm sorry, dear, I didn't know
I was supposed to call you Sacchan,

327
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,935
my little monkey?

328
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:07,306
Aren't you the ninja academy's
little idol, Horny Rose?

329
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,343
I'm very sorry, I didn't recognize you
under all the makeup!

330
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:14,113
I never thought Katsura
would be such a weakling.

331
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,315
And the other two are just kids.

332
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:20,586
According to my data sources,
our chance of winning is 99.8%.

333
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,821
What do we do?

334
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,823
I don't think I can win
against the real ninja.

335
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:24,891
Hurry! Ready!

336
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:25,958
Curry? No way!

337
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,193
What kind of a weapon is that?

338
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,295
You expect me to have
curry plates, too?

339
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,596
Whoa!! They've got them too!

340
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,664
Is anyone else seeing this?

341
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,100
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!

342
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,737
Unfortunately, we have already
calculated your chances of success.

343
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:41,374
If you strike us with curry, there's 99.8%
of a chance of being blocked.

344
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,476
Shut up! We won't know that
until we try!

345
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,545
Don't underestimate our Triple Curry!

346
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:46,946
Triple?
Does that include me?

347
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,614
Am I a member of the triple?

348
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,751
We'll show you the difference
between fake and real ninjas!

349
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,295
It's scalding!
A hot piece of potato went down my back!

350
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,231
A hot potato is dancing on my back!
It's hot!

351
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:09,202
We used the same technique,
but have different results.

352
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,170
This is the difference in our skills!

353
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:12,872
They're eating it!

354
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,373
Good grief.

355
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,476
Our technique was completely
read by them beforehand!

356
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,613
You're more naive than I thought!

357
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,983
You are the ones who are naive.

358
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,384
What do you...?

359
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,455
‐My stomach.
‐My stomach.

360
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,425
You bastard, what did you do
to that curry?!

361
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,197
Didn't your mommy tell you never
to take food from a stranger?

362
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,634
You dug your own graves by showing off
your fancy curry technique.

363
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,270
You need to learn some
common sense before being a ninja.

364
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,271
Yeah, you too.

365
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,674
Captain!
What happened?

366
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,743
You, how could you?

367
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,679
I was a little hungry,
so I had a bite of curry!

368
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,514
What? You ate it, too?!

369
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,682
It's fine.

370
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,186
I can overcome this great urge
to poop, I know I can.

371
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,022
Being a ninja is all about
how much you can endure.

372
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,490
Always keep that in mind.

373
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,425
I'll show you
my true ninja technique!

374
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,861
Ninja Art, "Shadow Clone Technique"!

375
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,531
You'll never figure out
which is the real me!

376
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,768
You make it so obvious!!

377
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,406
Oh, no!
Poor Goh really had to go.

378
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,808
Well then, looks like
it's my turn now.

379
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,211
Ninja Art, "Oil Injection!"

380
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,179
Time to get swole!

381
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,131
Ninja Art, "Oil Injection!"

382
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,433
Time to get swole!

383
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,505
No‐one asked you
to get swole in your pants!

384
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,673
This isn't good.

385
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:57,076
According to my data sources,
there's a 99.8% probability

386
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,811
I'll be beaten in the next scene.

387
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,313
It's this scene!

388
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,718
What the hell are you guys
doing down there?

389
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,653
Hattori!
What's the meaning of this?

390
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,823
I thought you guys were the five
greatest ninjas in the world!!

391
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,361
You've got it all wrong.

392
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,730
The Pegasus Meteor Attack
is supposed to be like this.

393
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,800
Idiot, it's supposed to look
like the Pegasus constellation.

394
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,968
Hattori!

395
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,569
What the hell are you
doing down there?

396
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,605
Is this recess in kindergarten or what?

397
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,340
Magistrate!
The Pegasus Meteor Attack!

398
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,374
It's like this, right?

399
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,376
Magistrate!
Give him a big "no" sign!

400
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,477
He's an idiot!
Idiot!

401
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,979
Both of you are idiots!

402
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,647
That technique is done like this!

403
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,882
I recorded all the episodes, you morrons!

404
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:40,119
Just so you know, you may have been
popular with a small handful of boys

405
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,155
at school, but they were
all disgusting weren't they?

406
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,924
They just had a thing for glasses.

407
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:48,461
Hey Rose, you know your so‐called
best friend Violet.

408
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,830
She was actually talking crap
about you behind your back.

409
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,031
And you girls!

410
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,667
Would you just stop fighting
like high school teenagers?!

411
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,735
Hey, Gin!

412
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,136
We've got to end this quickly!

413
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,106
Or else Kagura's will be in worst scene
a heroine could ever do!

414
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,442
That doesn't really
get me motivated at all!

415
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:07,747
I don't really care about Elizabeth or
whether Kagura poops in her pants.

416
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:08,748
Just wait.

417
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,850
I'll poop in your face
when I get better!

418
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,618
You just wait.

419
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,754
Captain, you gotta relax!

420
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,689
Take deep breaths like me.

421
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,062
Stop! Are you trying
to give birth right now?!

422
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,066
It's getting noisy in here.

423
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,001
Let's put an end
to this fighting already.

424
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,369
I couldn't agree more.

425
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,705
You and I have a lot to talk about.

426
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,341
I wish we'd met under
different circumstances.

427
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,476
Oh, yeah, is that so?

428
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,312
Haven't I been telling you
that we already.

429
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,715
Have met under
different circumstances?!!

430
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,296
He disappeared?

431
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,031
Gin! Look out, Gin!

432
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,234
Below me?

433
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:03,803
That little rat...

434
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:08,040
<i>Wait, what's this sweet scent?</i>

435
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,311
I can't move my body!

436
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,748
How do my roses smell?

437
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,251
Ninja Art, "Coiling Aroma Attack!"

438
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:23,789
Anyone who inhales the scent of my
poison rose will be totally paralyzed!

439
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,757
Now, Zenzo!

440
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,625
Finish him now!

441
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,764
Rin, Pyoh, Toh, Sha,
Kai, Jin, Retsu...

442
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,166
Monkey! How can she move?!

443
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,001
My technique didn't work on her?

444
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:40,906
Don't tell me she used the smell of natto
to cancel out the scent of my roses?!

445
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,609
Ninja Art!
I will Natto give up!

446
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,445
Wake up now, Gin!

447
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,151
Now, die, Comic Samurai!

448
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,356
The one to die... is you!

449
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,092
Zenzo!

450
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,393
Zenzo!

451
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:02,895
Oh, you're so mean!

452
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:05,731
Zenzo has hemorrhoids!
And it stinks!

453
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,870
Th‐This can't be...

454
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,571
The Ninja Five.

455
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,573
No way this can happen.

456
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,982
I hope that you make it
in time, Kagura.

457
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,319
Eli... Elizabeth!

458
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,354
Oh, my goodness!

459
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,390
Elizabeth! It's terrible,
absolutely terrible!

460
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,626
Oh, no, this is awful!

461
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,028
Hey, Cobra, isn't that kinda weird?

462
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,463
It looks like some cotton
is coming out.

463
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,899
That's right, and there's
no blood at all, either.

464
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,068
I already told you fools.

465
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,006
Elizabeth isn't here anymore.

466
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,942
Elizabeth was never here
in the first place!

467
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:54,079
You still don't you get it,
do you, Katsura?

468
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,683
That old man made an
Elizabeth doll to lure you here,

469
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,052
and it worked even better
than we thought.

470
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,188
You guys were completely duped.

471
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,091
Cobra.
Hey, Cobra.

472
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,526
What's the meaning of this?

473
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,128
Come to think of it.

474
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,598
I forgot that we had a fight yesterday
over who'd get fried tofu

475
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:13,866
in our soba noodle.

476
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:16,702
<i>So Elizabeth just left the house</i>
<i>because you two fought?!</i>

477
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,003
<i>Gimme a break!!</i>

478
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,940
<i>You made us go through</i>
<i>all this trouble for nothing?</i>

479
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:39,491
Hello!
I have something to ask you.

480
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,996
Elizabeth, I've been looking
all over for you.

481
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,164
What were you doing?

482
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,031
What's that?

483
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,833
Is it a newspaper salesman again?

484
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,468
Just tell them "to screw off."

485
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,636
I swear they never give up.

486
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,071
Who the hell has money
for newspapers?

487
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:54,206
Anyway, I'll be coming
home late tonight.

488
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,343
Just microwave one of the hamburgers
in the fridge for dinner I guess.

489
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,211
Ehh... frozen food again?

490
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,579
I'm so sick of it.

491
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,580
It's just not fair.

492
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,683
I know you always go out to eat
good food with random guys

493
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,152
after you cake on
your makeup every night.

494
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,522
Now look what you've done!

495
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,024
You made your father very upset!

496
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,759
You shouldn't say things like that.

497
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,664
Elizabeth, where are you?

498
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,899
Elizabeth!

499
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,027
<i>Hey, Sadaharu!</i>

500
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,729
<i>How did you get so big?</i>

501
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:57,629
<i>The next episode...</i>
