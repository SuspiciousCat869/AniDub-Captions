1
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,755
Make yourself useful...

2
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,091
and do some volunteer work
or something!

3
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,288
Oh! The Captain's crying!

4
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,255
Incredible!

5
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:05,325
Otsu's new song must be her
very greatest hit ever!

6
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,360
Yeah...

7
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,628
it moves me even more than
her other songs.

8
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,732
It might even be her best since
"Your Father is Bleep Bleep"?

9
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:12,466
Listen!

10
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,502
I hear she's appearing on that show,
"Edo's Got Talent"

11
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,305
A Lately, Otsu's becoming
more and more famous.

12
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,907
I'm very happy that Otsu
is becoming a big star...

13
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,510
but at the same time, it
also makes me a bit sad..

14
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,346
What's wrong?
Sergeant?

15
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,482
C‐Captain...

16
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,751
check this out.

17
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,065
What's thebig deal?

18
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,768
Who cares about some stupid
kid's puppy love?

19
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,771
More importantly, what happened
to my drama rerun?

20
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,106
Whatever happened with the battle
between Lotty and Bunny?

21
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,776
Just when Lotty and Bunny were
about to finally have their

22
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,712
showdown, the fearsome Alien Emperor
attacked the Earth.

23
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,015
Lotty and Bunny joined forces
to defeat the Emperor, the end.

24
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,451
Are you serious?
How do you know all that?

25
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,521
Yesterday was the final episode,
right, Sadaharu?

26
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,057
Oh my god, and I totally missed it!

27
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,492
You mean I'll never get
to see Lotty again?

28
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,529
Never mind that, Shinpachi's
been acting strange.

29
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,732
He keeps tearing days off
the calendar one by one.

30
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:19,699
Hey...

31
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,502
you aren't gonna bend
space time by doing that.

32
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,371
Stop running away from reality...

33
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,474
This is what happens when
you fall in love with an idol.

34
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,311
I mean, I'm a fan of the weather lady,
but I know better than to...

35
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,380
<i>...Maya</i> <i>Sizitzy,</i> <i>juar</i> <i>got</i>
<i>married</i> <i>last</i> <i>month.</i>

36
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,249
That's great, you might
actually manage

37
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,652
to do it with that black
hole in your heart.

38
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:40,854
Wow!

39
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,389
Shinpachi's body automatically

40
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,125
reacts to errands even
when he's lost his sanity!

41
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,862
Uh, we don't need
any newspapers...

42
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,664
Otsu?

43
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,471
"Break up with the guy,
or I'll kill you berry much."

44
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,107
Is the writer of this witless note

45
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,275
one of your witless
fans or something?

46
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,312
Countless letters like this one
are being sent to my agency.

47
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,981
It really freaked me out,
so I told my dad,

48
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,783
and he told me that
you'd help me.

49
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,852
Yeah, that father of yours.

50
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,720
Tell me, is he doing well?

51
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:21,995
Yes.

52
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,763
When I told him about all
these death threats,

53
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,599
he lost it and threatened
to break out of prison.

54
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,002
Then we'd better do something before
your father does something stupid.

55
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,471
Do you mean you're
willing to help me, then?

56
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:32,773
Yeah, but, the problem is...

57
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,641
the list of suspects includes
all of your fans,

58
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,976
which is how many?

59
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,112
But I have a feeling it's probably
someone in show biz.

60
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,550
<i>Ever since these threatening letters</i>
<i>started coming in...</i>

61
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,020
strange things have been happening
all around me, but the thing is...

62
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,722
It only happens...

63
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,458
when I'm in a TV studio or
out shooting a drama...

64
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:58,131
It wouldn't be possible for an ordinary
fan to do all this.

65
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,065
Hm.

66
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,268
‐Just break up with him, then.
‐Huh?

67
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,572
Break up with this guy, and everything
will work out just fine.

68
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,574
But, but I don't want to break up.

69
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,176
I can't imagine doing that.

70
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,077
I mean, he's the only guy
in show business

71
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,846
who's ever been truly nice to me!

72
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,114
No!

73
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:17,450
Get real, guys are always
acting nice to hot girls!

74
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:21,388
If we can't narrow down the suspects,
then all we can do is protect you!

75
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:22,622
I, Shinpachi Shimura..

76
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,091
will stick close to you and
protect you with my life!

77
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,627
He's back from the dead.

78
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:31,831
Come on, you two!

79
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,133
Let's get going already.

80
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,869
If you don't question authority,
you'll lose your humanity!

81
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,038
Wait, what's with that costume?

82
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,540
I mean your ears..
they are freaking huge!

83
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,976
Detective Munch, Baltimore
homi, I mean SVU.

84
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,377
Talk about a stretch!

85
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,179
Kagura, what are you
supposed to be?

86
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,981
Talking is overrated.

87
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,051
Of course, that leaves
you to be Dale.

88
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,286
I won't say Bing Bang Bong!

89
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,389
Oh.

90
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,924
So that's her boyfriend?

91
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:58,959
That's Goemon,

92
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,128
the lead singer of the nationwide
popular idol band, "Handsome"?

93
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,363
Wow, you sure know a lot.

94
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,931
You're a big fan, huh?

95
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,400
No, I'm not interested in sleazy boys.

96
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,002
I prefer the quirky type, you know.

97
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,136
Otsu, dear.

98
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,137
I think it would be wise

99
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,173
for us to not see each other
for a while, you know.

100
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,642
What?
But why, Goemon?

101
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,110
I don't want to do that.

102
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,379
I don't want to be apart from you,
either, you know.

103
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,915
But, well, it really isn't wise to...

104
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,617
upset our fans too much, you know.

105
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,951
I know better than you...

106
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:29,389
I know how valuable, and frightening,
fans can be, you know...

107
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,691
so let's just give it a little bit of
time, you know.

108
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,362
Don't worry, once the interest
dies down in the tabloids,

109
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,664
we'll be able to see each other
every day, you know.

110
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,799
Oh, Goemon...

111
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,878
You're amazing, Otsu,
the best in Japan!

112
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,847
Now let's shoot for
he best in the world!

113
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,814
Right!

114
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,451
You odd jobs people
here again?

115
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,686
What is the trouble this time?

116
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,255
It seems that Otsu is
being threatened by a fan.

117
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,058
So we have been hired to guard
her and solve the case.

118
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,394
Otsu. Always doing
something unnecessary.

119
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,094
But...

120
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,429
What do you mean, ma'am?

121
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,497
Receiving a death threat

122
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,700
every now and then is expected
a when you're a celebrity star...

123
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,835
If we were to worry about
every single one of them,

124
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,104
we would never make it
in showbiz, you know.

125
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,906
Yes but, weren't you
the one who showed

126
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,675
the threatening letter to Otsu?

127
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,710
What I wanted was
for her to be a bit

128
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,212
more conscientious of who
she is and her career.

129
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,481
But I guess it was a waste of time.

130
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,350
Who knows what'll happen now...

131
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,418
after that scandal.

132
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,019
But anyway, do as you will...

133
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,354
but...

134
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,424
please do not interfere
with her work, alright?

135
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,060
What're we going to do, Agent J?

136
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,528
Let me think about it, Agent K.

137
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,197
We should start by first
checking out that restaurant

138
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:48,068
where we should be able to find
illegal aliens in disguise.

139
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,202
Okay.

140
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:50,704
I make this look good!

141
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,506
Who's Agent J?
And who's Agent K?

142
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,183
Be sure to get home safely,
you guys!

143
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,454
So far, my investigation...

144
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,623
has uncovered several possible suspects.

145
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,059
The first is TV personality, Hairy Ding.

146
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,894
He's a multi‐talented TV figure,

147
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,996
who hosts a talk show, and also acts.

148
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,398
He has a grudge against Otsu

149
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,366
for revealing his secret,
that he wears a wig.

150
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,703
This is Mu, a wealthy TV producer.

151
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,439
He's been asking Otsu
out several times.

152
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,776
According to my research,
he's into girlie photo mags.

153
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:03,877
And then...

154
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,379
there's Humpty Wienerstein,
the director.

155
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,849
He's infamous in show biz for always
hitting on the leading actresses...

156
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,287
Sean Ross, the top actor
of suspense dramas.

157
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,824
There's a rumor that there were
plans for casting with Otsu,

158
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,092
but it was canceled...

159
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,494
Abby Cedy, the actress.

160
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,697
She's always complaining that everyone
mistakes her for Otsu.

161
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,000
These five show biz people..

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,001
are the main suspects.

163
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:28,868
You softie!

164
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,370
You're such a softie, Shinpachi.

165
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,773
Certainly those people are suspects, as
well.

166
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,175
But then...

167
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,610
you're also forgetting the biggest suspect
of them all.

168
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,646
The biggest suspect?

169
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,114
That's right...

170
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,416
He's always in the shadows of every
incident.

171
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:44,984
You're forgetting the fellow who

172
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,886
always happens to appear at the scene...

173
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,421
of every single crime!

174
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,457
Who?
Who?

175
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,958
The mystery shadow.

176
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:52,826
<i>That's right...</i>

177
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:53,793
<i>It's the mystery shadow</i>

178
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,396
<i>who appears in so many</i>
<i>detective and mystery manga...</i>

179
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,631
He always appears when
they don't want to reveal

180
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,533
<i>who the killer is, but they still want to show</i>

181
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,068
<i>what it was that they did.</i>

182
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,403
<i>That's the mystery shadow.</i>

183
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,672
Who are you?!

184
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,208
I'm Richard Moore, known as
"Sleeping Richard."

185
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,776
I can see you talking, you know!

186
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,245
Now, where'd he come from?

187
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,314
I found him dead drunk
downstairs at Otose's,

188
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,316
but I've always wanted to
do "Case Closed".

189
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,418
We're gonna get sued someday.

190
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,254
And cut!

191
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,722
Great!

192
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,826
Hey, Otsu.
Good, good job!

193
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,728
Awesome work, everybody!

194
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,263
Thank you very much.

195
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:31,764
All right.

196
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,901
We need to start
setting up for scene 12!

197
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,505
All right.

198
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:41,374
Mu is supposed to be here at
this shoot location so...

199
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,009
keep a sharp lookout, will ya?

200
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,813
Yeah, but I haven't seen Mu
around here at all, though.

201
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,014
H‐Help!

202
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:48,781
‐Huh?
‐Huh?

203
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,716
Huh?

204
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,986
The, the producer, Mu, he is...!

205
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,162
He... he is.

206
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,172
And why is there a hot spring
at the edge of a cliff.

207
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,209
Hello viewers!

208
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,978
I'm your host for the mystery show,
"Serial Killer."

209
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,214
It began with a threatening letter,
but now...

210
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,383
we have a victim, and the killer...

211
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,319
is no doubt gloating
about the perfect crime

212
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,655
that he committed right about now.

213
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,926
Who is the mystery shadow,
and how was the crime possible,

214
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,095
especially in a locked room
with nowhere to escape?

215
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,300
The secrets will be revealed
after these messages.

216
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,968
This isn't a mystery show!

217
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,070
And it isn't even a locked room!

218
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,860
So now why was Mu ...?

219
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,996
All right, we'll take it from here.

220
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,231
Move aside, we're taking this case.

221
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,733
Don't screw up any of our evidence.

222
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,934
Move aside, now.

223
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,103
You're the ones trying
to screw this up!

224
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,375
Sea.

225
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,977
Roach.

226
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,546
Hey guys, we've uncovered
his dying message!

227
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:29,248
Would you two please stop messing up the
investigation!

228
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,087
Hi Goemon, dear!

229
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,656
You mean right now?

230
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,424
I'm at a hot spring location.

231
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,861
Oh, for a drama shoot.

232
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,997
Oh.
Definitely!

233
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:44,964
I'll do my best.

234
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,766
How about you?

235
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,501
Oh, that's simply great!

236
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,144
<i>‐So now you like singing?</i>
‐What a dufus, man!

237
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:58,945
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

238
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,113
You know you were gonna get hurt

239
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,248
if you stuck your nose into this,
you saw it coming.

240
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,516
You should've just
stayed at home,

241
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,485
peeling the pages
of your calendar.

242
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:08,388
I already told you, I'm going
to protect Otsu no matter what.

243
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,823
Oh, trying to show off
is a waste of time.

244
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,526
Listen, a girl in love
is like a wild boar...

245
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,628
they only see what's straight
in front of them.

246
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,730
It's actually not like that at all.

247
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,465
I owe Otsu my life.

248
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,367
She saved me a long time ago.

249
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,507
<i>It was before I met you, Gin.</i>

250
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,909
<i>I was working part time, and well.</i>

251
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,878
<i>I wasn't good at anything I did...</i>

252
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,280
<i>and was always getting</i>
<i>scolded by my manager.</i>

253
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,282
<i>Just when I was sick of everything...</i>

254
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,251
<i>and I felt like just running away.</i>

255
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,253
<i>I heard her.</i>

256
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,688
<i>I heard her singing.</i>

257
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:52,865
<i>To be honest.</i>

258
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,001
<i>I didn't know what the hell</i>
<i>she was singing about,</i>

259
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,502
<i>and there wasn't any audience...</i>

260
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,104
<i>but when I saw her singing.</i>

261
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,206
<i>Just singing with all her heart...</i>

262
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,476
<i>well...</i>

263
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,745
<i>my eyes started tearing up.</i>

264
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:18,958
Thank you so much!

265
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,496
Otsu probably doesn't
even remember me,

266
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:24,931
but she really cheered me up.

267
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:25,998
It doesn't matter what it is.

268
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,934
If there's anything I can do to help...

269
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,702
I want to do it...

270
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,304
to repay her for that day...

271
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,172
There might not be
much that I can do...

272
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,842
but I still want to do
whatever I possible can...

273
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,177
I owe it to her, I suppose.

274
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,181
I get it then...

275
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,184
If that's how you feel, then I have
nothing more to say.

276
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,987
Hey, Gin, hey Gin, big news!

277
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,523
Lotty is here!

278
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,592
Lotty is here to record shoot

279
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,861
"The World Is Full of
Masked Demons, Damn It!".

280
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:55,762
Lotty?

281
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,363
I want...

282
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,898
your autograph!

283
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,937
Oh, the broadcast of
"Edo's Got Talent" is ending soon...

284
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,806
I'd better use the john now.

285
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,981
Dad!

286
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,315
There's two dads?

287
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,284
Which one is the real one?

288
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,852
How'd this happen?

289
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:20,753
Carrie!

290
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,221
This is all Carrie's fault!

291
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,257
What good is that going to do?

292
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,559
I think I figured it all out!

293
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,333
<i>I never imagined it would turn into</i>
<i>a fiasco like this, you know...</i>

294
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:35,935
<i>I know.</i>

295
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,105
<i>That chick will never learn to shut her</i>
<i>trap in front of the press, you know!</i>

296
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,206
<i>"You know"?</i>

297
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,407
<i>Could that be...</i>

298
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,543
You've gotta be kidding,
I haven't even done her...

299
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:44,811
not even once, you know.

300
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,147
And I've been cast in the sitcom
that's going to be broadcasted.

301
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:49,949
That's right.

302
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,451
So I figured I better take
care of this first, you know.

303
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,521
<i>Girls with no experience</i>
<i>are no fun, you know...</i>

304
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,657
<i>She fell in love</i>
<i>with me right away</i>

305
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:00,193
<i>just because I was a little bit</i>
<i>nice to her, you know.</i>

306
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,695
I mean, he's the only guy
in show business

307
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,730
who's ever been truly nice to me!

308
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,332
<i>That girl?</i>
<i>I don't really care,</i>

309
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,967
<i>you know, she'll just disappear...</i>

310
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,135
anyway, I've...

311
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,304
Ahhh!

312
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,807
Wh‐Wh‐Who are you?!
Who are you?

313
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:16,776
You dare...

314
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,711
to call yourself a human?

315
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,913
You're mother is a...

316
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,182
bleeping bleep!

317
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,122
Hey, come on.

318
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,390
Enough of this.

319
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,292
My schedule is very full.

320
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,195
We may not seem like it,
but we're all very busy.

321
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,196
That's right.

322
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,698
I don't know what you're
trying to do here,

323
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,700
but frankly, you're a nuisance.

324
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,134
By the way, Hairy Ding,

325
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,103
why are you on the set
of a drama?

326
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,972
What?
I'm the, you know...

327
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,073
storyteller.

328
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,710
I told you from the beginning
not to get in our way, didn't I?

329
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,878
Yes, well...

330
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,313
I wanted to stay out of
your way, but then...

331
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,849
I found out just who the killer is.

332
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,853
So let's make it quick and
get it over with, then.

333
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,623
The killer's identity...

334
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,728
It is you!

335
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:09,795
What?

336
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,464
What‐What are you talking about?

337
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,065
I'd have no reason to do
such a thing.

338
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,000
If anything...

339
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,269
I'm the one who always
solves the mystery here.

340
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,438
Yes, but that's what
all criminals say.

341
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,708
You're panicking and starting
to get cold sweats, Sean Ross.

342
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,112
If you're going to accuse me,
show me some proof first!

343
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,079
Some proof!

344
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:28,281
Some proof.

345
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,949
Some proof, you say.

346
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,951
You are the real killer!

347
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,020
Just look!
That mole is suspicious.

348
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,289
That's ridiculous, I have an alibi.

349
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,157
Oh, an alibi?

350
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,091
I see.

351
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,826
Then you are the killer.

352
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,495
No way I am!

353
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,598
Tell me, are you just talking out
of your butt now or not?

354
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,334
No, of course not,
I'm not talking out of...

355
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,835
It's time to come clean because

356
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,204
I can see right through you
and your lies!

357
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,173
Who‐ who are you?

358
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,474
Who am I?

359
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,110
I'm Nancy Drew, teen investigator!

360
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,880
Hey!
Nancy Drew is really a blondie!

361
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,182
I already know who the killer is.

362
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:05,918
But that is....

363
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:19,932
Goemon.

364
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,334
What's going on?

365
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:22,768
He is the second victim.

366
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,836
No.

367
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:26,238
This isn't a victim, I heard him
talking in the john.

368
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,074
This guy is a real scumbag...

369
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:31,177
who has been playing with
Otsu's heart all along.

370
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,846
A playboy who just wanted
to take advantage of her

371
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,781
worried that the scandal
may kill his career.

372
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,217
Do you mean that he is
the killer, then?

373
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,719
Well he's...

374
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,488
‐That was...
‐Otsu!

375
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,029
You are.

376
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,197
The mystery shadow!

377
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,398
It really does exist.

378
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,233
How about that?
It really exists.

379
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,401
Otsu, are you all right?

380
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,502
Help me, please!

381
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,803
Hey, look!
A UFO!

382
00:18:59,105 --> 00:18:59,939
After him, Shinpachi!

383
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,073
Right!

384
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,446
Stop!

385
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,519
This is a very fine work.

386
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:14,654
The treasure...

387
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,921
The treasure!

388
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:19,992
The weather for tomorrow will...

389
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,395
Sorry!

390
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,330
Commercial! Cut!
Go to commercial!

391
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,132
Sorry!

392
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,606
Give it up already, Mystery Shadow!

393
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,842
You missed me, you.

394
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,212
Aaaah!

395
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,684
Hey, you, man!

396
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,020
Show your true self,
take off your mask!

397
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,522
No! You don't understand,

398
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,956
I've been like this from birth.

399
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,058
I'm an Amanto.

400
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:53,826
What do you mean?

401
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:54,960
Uh, what do you mean
what do you mean?

402
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,328
There's no face to reveal.
I'm...

403
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:01,333
I'm an Amanto, and this is just how I
look, to be honest with you guys so...

404
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,569
I know you!

405
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,503
I've seen him before.

406
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,306
Everywhere I went, there was always
somebody who looked just like him.

407
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,443
No, I didn't mean any harm, I swear...

408
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,244
I'm just a fan of Otsu

409
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,714
and I've been following her for several
weeks trying to get her autograph.

410
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,650
In other words, you're a stalker, huh?

411
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,052
You're complicating things, you idiot!

412
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:21,987
‐H‐Help me!
‐You have be the killer!

413
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,422
You went through
her dressing room

414
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,825
and then you sent that death
threat letter to her!

415
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,660
No! What are you talking about?!

416
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,061
I did go through her dressing room

417
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,297
but I never sent any
threatening letter.

418
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,667
But then who sent the
death threat letter?

419
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,269
To answer that we need to
ask who would benefit

420
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,338
from Otsu and that guy
breaking up?

421
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:40,706
And that would be...

422
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,575
only Otsu herself.

423
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,345
The letter was sent
by the person

424
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,048
who wishes the most
for Otsu's happiness.

425
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:50,783
And that...

426
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,189
is her mother.

427
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,361
Yes...that is right.

428
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,463
It was you, Mom?

429
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:06,966
I told you...

430
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,001
I just wanted to give her a warning.

431
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,438
Just as you people said...

432
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,474
that Goemon is the lowest
form of a scumbag...

433
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,943
Like me, that girl has
no luck with men,

434
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,245
and she's stubborn to boot.

435
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,483
There isn't a parent around who
doesn't think of their child.

436
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,486
But, there are also few children who
understand their parents' feelings.

437
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,789
That's just the way things are.

438
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,959
Next time why don't you just try talking
to your daughter normally?

439
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,428
Yes, well, neither of us are very good

440
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,297
at being honest with ourselves.

441
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,668
Who are you supposed to be?!

442
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,039
Alright...

443
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,307
I see.

444
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,877
Look, Otsu, I...
Uh...

445
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:52,645
Oh, forget it.

446
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,346
I'll be fine, just fine.

447
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,549
I'm used to this kind of thing,
you see...

448
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,517
I have really bad luck with men.

449
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,487
The person I fell in love with
before was a leather man.

450
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:02,955
A leather man?

451
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,826
I know now that my mom was
only worried about me...

452
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,360
but I was a fool.

453
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:09,995
And he dumped me..

454
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,664
and now I've lost...

455
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:14,333
my popularity as a pop star...

456
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:17,970
and I've lost...

457
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,472
well, I've lost everything
in my life.

458
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:23,842
Look, Otsu, I, uh.

459
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:25,778
‐Captain!!
‐Captain!!

460
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,216
We came to help you out.

461
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,518
It's not fair that you're
hogging all the glory!

462
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:35,087
We're prepared to
stand guard all night.

463
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,455
All of you!

464
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,892
I'm afraid that we're all very
persistent, tenacious fans.

465
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,128
We're not going to stop
being your fans...

466
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,964
over a little scandal or two!

467
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,835
<i>Thank you, Shinji.</i>

468
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:51,737
<i>No.</i>

469
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,239
My name is Shinpachi.

470
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:01,247
Oh well, I guess I must have
passed out in the hot spa.

471
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,851
Case closed, join us in the
next episode!

472
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,711
<i>Gin has amnesia?</i>

473
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,412
<i>You mean he's forgotten me?</i>

474
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,747
<i>Don't give me that!</i>

475
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,083
<i>You mean, I remember him,</i>
<i>but he forgot me?!</i>

476
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:44,917
<i>That sucks!</i>

477
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,452
<i>Who does he think he is?</i>

478
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:47,853
<i>The next episode...</i>

479
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,499
Hey Gintoki, there haven't been
too many freebies lately, huh?

480
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,800
Yeah.
