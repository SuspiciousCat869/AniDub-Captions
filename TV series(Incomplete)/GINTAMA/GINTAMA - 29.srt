1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:01,468
Hey!

2
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,838
Keep the room well‐lit and
watch from a distance, ha‐hey?

3
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,379
Who art thou?

4
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,421
My name is Gankeimaru.

5
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,390
If you cherish your life,
drop the sword

6
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,958
you are wearing
and leave at once.

7
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,293
Alas, I see.

8
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,929
So thou art the ogre whom
hath been hunting swords

9
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,131
and causing a public
disturbance here.

10
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:12,566
Most well met.

11
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:13,867
If thou desirest my sword,

12
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,636
then summon thine own
and take it by force!

13
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,082
Die!

14
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,640
That was too easy.

15
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:57,010
The only impressive thing about you
is the sword you carry, eh?

16
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,846
This is far from the
strongest sword I've seen.

17
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,417
I heard that a samurai's blade
can cut apart even a star,

18
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,086
but it seems coming to Earth
was a big waste of time.

19
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,755
Oh, where is it, I wonder.

20
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,491
The legendary sword, "Star Destroyer"?

21
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,832
Ouch!

22
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,400
Oh, my god, just look!

23
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,836
Long hours as a manga artist
have turned my stomach

24
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,571
into a double cheeseburger!

25
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,074
Jennifer is going to hate me
if I look like this!

26
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,543
What's the matter, Michael?

27
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,813
Did a dip pen pierce your biceps
and make them explode, huh?

28
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,081
No, woman!

29
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,649
Look at this, Marilyn.

30
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,050
Look at my fat stomach!

31
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,618
You need to be careful.

32
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,421
Dip pens are sharp enough to
kill people, you know that?

33
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,224
I said this isn't about dip pens,
stupid woman!

34
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,358
‐It's my stomach!
‐Oh, okay!

35
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,426
Don't worry!

36
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,096
Just use the "Round‐and‐Round
Fat Burning Down" Machine!

37
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,698
Just do this for just twelve hours
every day, and your stomach fat

38
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,568
will melt away right
before your very eyes!

39
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,502
Come on!

40
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,137
<i>Are you serious, Marilyn?</i>

41
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:57,838
<i>Yes!</i>

42
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,240
<i>Order right now and you'll also</i>
<i>get the blue and red versions</i>

43
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,976
<i>on top of the yellow for</i>
<i>this incredibly low price!</i>

44
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,511
<i>Just pay in 12 monthly installments,</i>

45
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,213
<i>and</i> <i>you'll</i> <i>get</i> <i>the</i> <i>body</i>
<i>of</i> <i>your</i> <i>dreams!</i>

46
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,515
<i>And</i> <i>then</i> <i>it's</i> <i>goodbye</i> <i>to</i>
<i>my</i> <i>double</i> <i>cheeseburger!</i>

47
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,150
<i>‐Yahoo!</i>
‐Yahoo!

48
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,152
"Yahoo" my ass, dummy.

49
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,987
Where did you get that stupid thing?

50
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,123
I called that number and
they gave it to me.

51
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,525
They gave me this, and this,
and this, and this, too.

52
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,093
‐Yahoo!
‐Good god!

53
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,995
Hey, Kagura,
you know this is called...

54
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,663
a televsion shopping channel.

55
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,665
It's a show where
people sell things.

56
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,068
Those things weren't free;
you bought them all.

57
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,002
Seriously?

58
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,037
You should return those
items immediately.

59
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,140
They'll probably take
them back if you call.

60
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,475
Hey, that's not very funny
for a joke, Johnny!

61
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,010
Who're you calling Johnny?

62
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,812
Oh,Shinpachi, give me a hand.

63
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,347
We're returning all of this.

64
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,715
Right.

65
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,052
No, don't, give them back!

66
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,554
Johnny!

67
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,022
Depperson!

68
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,225
This is so unfair, damn it!

69
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,262
What if I end up with a
double cheeseburger?

70
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,496
Stupid Gin!

71
00:04:56,763 --> 00:05:00,100
Grown ups just don't
understand anything!

72
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,869
Oh...

73
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,704
Oh.

74
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,975
Hmm... Well this isn't it, either...

75
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,877
Hey!
What're you doing?

76
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,514
What're you doing walking
around with a bunch of swords

77
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,650
when there's an active
sword ban in this country?

78
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,784
That's against the law!

79
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,119
You're getting a fine, buddy.

80
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,954
That'll be a million, minimum.

81
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,557
Since there's three of us,
that's three million.

82
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,693
What a filthy stick!

83
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,629
It kinda smells like curry,
doesn't it?

84
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,465
So, you're asking me
to buy this from you?

85
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,801
I want to buy stuff from
the Shopping Channel.

86
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,870
I don't really understand
your circumstances,

87
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,572
but I can't pay you for this.

88
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,408
However, I'd buy that odd creature
over there, if you want.

89
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,677
Damn you.

90
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,879
Don't you realize that
we're Government officials?

91
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,317
Phew! This thing totally
reeks of curry!

92
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,719
And it says "Lake Toya",
isn't this a souvenir?

93
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,521
I don't want it.

94
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,628
‐Stop right there!
‐Hey, you stop!

95
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,829
Where's the sword.

96
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,197
The legendary sword...?

97
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:08,668
You know, I really can't stand
Earth foods at all especially curry.

98
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,612
What?

99
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,446
A wooden sword?

100
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,548
If it belonged to a handsome guy,
perhaps I'll buy it.

101
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,049
I'll give you a really good price...

102
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,886
but I have no interest in something
of yours, young lady.

103
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,220
Come on!

104
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,256
Why won't anyone buy
this stick from me?!

105
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,757
You useless stick!

106
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,626
I don't even get paid properly,

107
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,462
so how am I supposed to buy
the things I want, huh?

108
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,697
Last month, I got paid
in pickled seaweed!

109
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,799
How sour can a
person's wage get?

110
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,669
‐H‐Hey!
‐The bridge!

111
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,504
Is my teenage life going
to be filled

112
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,940
with nothing but memories
of pickled seaweed?

113
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,646
This isn't it, or this either.

114
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,882
A monster on the bridge!

115
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,618
What is that wooden sword?!
The bridge is gone!

116
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,587
Wooden sword?

117
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,762
I can't even go home
even if I wanted to.

118
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,731
Because I took his precious
sword without his permission.

119
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,367
Gin's probably fuming
right about now.

120
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,377
Who the hell are you?

121
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,879
Little girl.

122
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,315
Where did you get that
wooden sword there?

123
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,917
The way that it cut a bridge
clean in two.

124
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,919
I've found it at last...

125
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,155
the legendary Star Destroyer!

126
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,392
Hand me that sword right now,
and I shall spare your life little girl.

127
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,803
Now you've done it, little girl!

128
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,117
A "Sword Hunter"?

129
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,185
Yeah, that's right.

130
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,587
There seems to be a lot of
attacks around town.

131
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,522
The hunter is apparently
an Amanto...

132
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,324
training to become
the strongest warrior

133
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,360
in the universe or
something like that.

134
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,901
He's apparently really strong, too.

135
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,837
Seems many Government
retainers and mercenaries

136
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,905
have already fallen to his strength.

137
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,375
That might have been his work
we just saw back there?

138
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,243
The strongest in the universe, huh?

139
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,245
I don't know what sort of
dream he's chasing,

140
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,680
but the stupidity of men stays

141
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,548
the same no matter
what star you're from.

142
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,851
All of these guys spend too much
time reading comics.

143
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,787
He might come after your
wooden sword, too, Gin.

144
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,522
<i>That</i> <i>wooden</i> <i>sword</i> <i>is</i>
<i>much</i> <i>more</i> <i>powerful</i>

145
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,391
<i>than</i> <i>an</i> <i>ordinary</i>
<i>metal</i> <i>one</i> <i>after</i> <i>all.</i>

146
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,892
<i>It cuts through everything.</i>

147
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,328
Why on earth is that
thing so strong?

148
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,863
The thing about that thing is, well.

149
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,198
When I was on a school field
trip to Lake Toya Resort,

150
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,700
there was a hermit who lived there.

151
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,501
Hold on.

152
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,436
Now that you mention it,
what'd I do with it?

153
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,477
What's with that guy, Sadaharu?

154
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,580
We should hide here for a while,
don't you think Sada.

155
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,284
I found you, little girl.

156
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,520
Hey, what the hell is
your problem, huh?

157
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,454
And you, too!

158
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,922
Pay up, girl!

159
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,490
That guy will pay for me!

160
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,325
You're not getting away!

161
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,294
I've seen many swords up until now,

162
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,830
but your sword is the legendary
sword I have been searching

163
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,232
for all these years,
The Star Destroyer!

164
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,074
Don't get so excited,
you sword freak.

165
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,311
It seems like you
underestimated me.

166
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,980
You held back so as to not kill me
didn't you, little girl?

167
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,783
But we of the Genbu Clan...

168
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,454
have hardened bodies that
even bullets bounce off of.

169
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,956
With this body and the
Star Destroyer Sword,

170
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,658
no one can stand against me!

171
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,560
The strongest sword
should be wielded

172
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,695
by the strongest warrior
in the universe!

173
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:56,563
Now!

174
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,865
Accept your defeat
and hand it over.

175
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,268
<i>Oh, this must be my punishment...</i>

176
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,705
<i>for bad karma because I stole</i>
<i>someone's cherished possession.</i>

177
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,174
<i>So now, God is trying</i>
<i>to set me straight.</i>

178
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,310
<i>But please listen to me, God.</i>

179
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,413
<i>Gintoki doesn't even</i>
<i>pay me a real salary.</i>

180
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,581
<i>And even worse...</i>

181
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,317
<i>he took away everything</i>
<i>that I cherished.</i>

182
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:22,922
<i>Maybe I should hand over his wooden</i>
<i>sword and make it easy on myself.</i>

183
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,290
<i>No, wait.</i>

184
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,193
<i>If I did that, then I would</i>
<i>be exactly like him.</i>

185
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:31,698
<i>At his age, it's impossible for</i>
<i>Gin to change his character.</i>

186
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,867
<i>But Kagura.</i>

187
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,335
<i>There's still time for you.</i>

188
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,271
<i>It's time to grow up!</i>
<i>Kagura!</i>

189
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,309
Dammit!
What have you done?

190
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:47,580
What?

191
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,764
Oh, good boy.

192
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,467
Good boy, well done, Sadaharu!

193
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,269
Let's go home and apologize.

194
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,004
Although, I'm still a little bit mad.

195
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:15,341
However, this sword looks best
on Gintoki's belt, after all.

196
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,878
<i>I'm home, everyone!</i>

197
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,446
Ouch!

198
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,948
Oh my goodness!

199
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,984
I can't believe I'm being mugged
by a bunch of samurais!

200
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,719
Today's my date with Jennifer.

201
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,820
What rotten luck.

202
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,788
Shit!

203
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,490
Jennifer is not coming.

204
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,458
And you are going to
die here, Michael.

205
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,359
Hey.

206
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,594
What're you doing here, Marilyn?

207
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,563
Nobody said anything about this.

208
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,599
Listen here, I heard you
called me "Frankenstein"

209
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,301
when you went out drinking
the other day!

210
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,469
Even though I told you the
only thing I've had done

211
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,204
was my nose, you bastard!

212
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,707
I'm going to take this
legendary sword "Star Destroyer,"

213
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,075
and tear apart your blonde ass

214
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,810
and make sure you're never
able to walk again!!

215
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,513
<i>This sword was fashioned from</i>
<i>a ten thousand year‐old tree</i>

216
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,382
<i>made of Adamantine that</i>
<i>grows on a distant planet.</i>

217
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,485
<i>This amazing wooden sword</i>
<i>can cut through rock,</i>

218
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,055
meteors, and even
your stupid muscles.

219
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,156
That's right!

220
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:03,890
<i>Buy now!</i>

221
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,893
<i>And as part of our special offer,</i>
<i>we'll even engrave the hilt!</i>

222
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:07,927
<i>‐Only 12 payments!</i>
‐Yes.

223
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:08,928
‐Just this much
‐Yes!

224
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:09,963
‐per month. Yes!
‐Yup.

225
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,631
<i>‐And you too,</i>
‐Engrave it with "Lake Toya" as always.

226
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:12,999
<i>‐can become an invincible samurai!</i>
‐That's "Lake Toya Resort."

227
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:13,933
‐Isn't that awesome?!
‐No...

228
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,636
I think I'll just stick with the
usual "Lake Toya" again.

229
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,372
Gintoki, what are you doing
on the phone?

230
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,674
Oh, listen to this, Kagura.

231
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,710
I got lucky at the casino, you see...

232
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,679
and the other day, I spilled curry
on my wooden sword,

233
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,916
and it smelled so bad,
I splurged on a brand new one.

234
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,418
What?
A wooden sword, like that one?

235
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,553
That's right!

236
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:34,988
But don't tell Shinpachi about it,

237
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,823
because I want to keep it
mysterious, you know.

238
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,158
I'll buy you something so you
keep quiet, what would you like?

239
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,293
Pickled seaweed?

240
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,894
I know you want pickled seaweed!

241
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,063
Your life revolves around
Pickled seaweed, after all!

242
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,099
What's that?

243
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,533
I thought I lost my sword.

244
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:48,601
But you had it all this time?

245
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,736
<i>Hey!</i>

246
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:50,703
<i>Why'd you break it?</i>

247
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,804
<i>What the hell?!</i>

248
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:55,441
<i>Johnny, I'm totally beat,</i>
<i>so just let me sleep, okay.</i>

249
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,631
Health!
Health!

250
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,832
Health!
Health me please!

251
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,034
Health!
Health!

252
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,135
You mean "help me"?

253
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,002
What's wrong?

254
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,737
A g‐g‐g‐g‐ coackroach!

255
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,305
It's in my room, health me!

256
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,173
What's the matter with you?

257
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,709
The strongest race in the universe
can't handle a little cockroach?

258
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,344
I can't stand them!
They're creepy!

259
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,312
Yelp!
Yelp with me now!

260
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,447
No, it's "Help me."

261
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,581
Okay?

262
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,150
Look, to live in Edo City,

263
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,752
is to live alongside the
cockroaches you know.

264
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,591
Good morning, everyone.

265
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:46,859
Uh...

266
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,761
‐Is something wrong?
‐A co‐cockroach!‐

267
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,130
One hell of a cockroach Shinpachi!

268
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,299
Pulp!
Pulp fiction!

269
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,600
You mean "help me."

270
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,402
Huh?
A cockroach?

271
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,904
What's this about now?

272
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:01,240
To Live in Edo City is like doing
afterschool club activities

273
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,809
with fellow cockroaches.

274
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,711
Hey, Shinpachi,
look behind you!

275
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,081
<i>Hump me!</i>

276
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,315
<i>Hump, hump me!</i>

277
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,950
<i>Hump me!</i>

278
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,485
<i>You mean "help me."</i>

279
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,493
Good afternoon, I am Chris Kimono.

280
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:24,430
Uh, today, we interrupt our normal
programming for an in‐depth look...

281
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,065
at the giant cockroach outbreak

282
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,301
currently happening
throughout the city of Edo.

283
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,470
Joining me is Prince Hata...

284
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,871
of the Midland Planet,

285
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,640
a renowned authority on
interplanetary zoology.

286
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,678
Prince, are these
really cockroaches?

287
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:39,645
Yes.

288
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,548
They are indeed cockroaches,
but they aren't from Earth.

289
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,083
They most likely
entered the capital

290
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,986
aboard an alien ship
that came to Earth.

291
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,188
<i>So they are alien cockroaches, then?</i>

292
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,257
<i>‐They are space cockroaches, yes.</i>
<i>‐Yeah.</i>

293
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,925
<i>‐Like I said, alien cockroaches.</i>
‐Alien cockroaches, they say.

294
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,594
<i>‐Space cockroaches.</i>
‐Damn it, just what we need.

295
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,729
<i>‐Not alien cockroaches.</i>
‐I really hope we don't have any of.

296
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,630
<i>Are you looking for a fight?</i>

297
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,931
<i>Hey! Stop the cameras!</i>

298
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:03,770
What was that?

299
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,738
How could something like that exist?

300
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,707
Is that really a cockroach?

301
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:08,674
I have no idea.

302
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,876
You have no idea?

303
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:10,977
Isn't this your home?

304
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,446
Listen up, you created that monster,
you know.

305
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,950
It's your lousy housekeeping that gave
birth to that poor creature in this filth.

306
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,119
Hey, you guys both
practically live here, too!

307
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:25,491
This is just my theory, but I think this
has something to do with it.

308
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,527
Ah!
My pickled seaweed!

309
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,561
And it's been chewed on.

310
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,362
Exactly.

311
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,030
Somehow, eating pickled seaweed...

312
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,132
must've caused a supernatural
reaction in their bodies

313
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,001
that no‐one could
have ever predicted.

314
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,202
Seriously?

315
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,103
Listen, you guys.

316
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,105
This is really dangerous, you know.

317
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,140
I mean, if this thing escapes
into the city,

318
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,775
we'll probably be stoned to death.

319
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,911
We'll exterminate it before
that ever happens!

320
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,113
Don't let it out of this house
no matter what!

321
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,815
Shinpachi, where's the bug spray?

322
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:49,882
Oh no!

323
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,317
I left it in the other room.

324
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,819
Are you serious?

325
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,954
Oh man, you're such a Shinpachi!

326
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,456
That's why you can never graduate
from being a Shinpachi!

327
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,224
What the hell?

328
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:01,093
Are you implying that my existence
is something to be ashamed of?

329
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,328
Unforgivable!
Unforgivable!

330
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,197
I'll go get it, for Christ's sake!

331
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,632
Who cares about a stupid
giant cockroach, dammit!

332
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,633
I'll wipe my own ass!

333
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,670
I'll keep wiping till I start
crapping blood!

334
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,911
Hah!

335
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,582
<i>Well, we have been</i>
<i>receiving calls and e‐mails</i>

336
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,017
<i>from one Alien‐Cockroach</i>
<i>victim after another.</i>

337
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,519
<i>There are even</i>
<i>frightening reports</i>

338
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,487
<i>of people being attacked</i>
<i>by these cockroaches...</i>

339
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,857
<i>Your thoughts, Prince Ca...</i>
<i>Uh, Prince?</i>

340
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,559
<i>Hey, you were just about to</i>
<i>call me Kaka, weren't you?</i>

341
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,127
<i>No, of course I wasn't.</i>

342
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,063
<i>What are your thoughts,</i>
<i>Prince Hata?</i>

343
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,131
<i>They are carnivorous cockroaches...</i>

344
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,867
<i>so I would advise caution.</i>

345
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,436
<i>Also, if you see them,</i>
<i>you must not kill them.</i>

346
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,037
<i>That would bring disaster.</i>

347
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,072
<i>Disaster?</i>

348
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:49,408
<i>What mysteries do these carnivorous</i>
<i>monster cocker‐oaches hold?</i>

349
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,544
<i>They are the carnivorous</i>
<i>"monster cocka‐roaches."</i>

350
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,512
So we were not supposed
to to kill 'em, eh?

351
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,949
Well, that was pretty close.
I was just about to kill one.

352
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:58,751
Huh?

353
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,920
What hell those guys
doing up there?

354
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,055
‐Die, you bug!
‐Damn bug!

355
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,858
So what, do you think you're
all grown up now?

356
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,461
Yeah, who do you think
raised you, huh?!

357
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,099
Hey.
Where's Shinpachi?

358
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,667
I don't see him.

359
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:16,669
Hey, Gin...

360
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,471
you don't think Shinpachi
was eaten by this...?

361
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:19,906
Don't be silly, Kagura.

362
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,008
It's just a huge cockroach,
there's no way.

363
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,812
Shinpachi!

364
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,014
Spit him out, damn bug!

365
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,115
What'd he taste like?

366
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,016
Tell me, huh?

367
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:30,850
Was it Beef or Fish?

368
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,951
What?
Tell me?

369
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,454
Oh, now look, It's crying.

370
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,556
What a baby!

371
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,823
If crying solved everything,

372
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,625
we wouldn't need
no police, idiot!

373
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,295
Hey, Boss, what should we
do with this ugly thing?

374
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,480
And so, I repeat.

375
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,317
Even if you find them, do not kill
the cocker‐oaches...

376
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,152
If you do, it's brethren
will come to its aid.

377
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,920
No one should attempt to kill it!

378
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,722
However, Prince Kaka,

379
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,992
that means there is no way to combat
these space cockroaches.

380
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,628
Hey, you clearly just said "Kaka."

381
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,863
Oh, we've just been connected live.

382
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,932
‐Sizitzy, are you at the scene?
‐Hey, don't change the subject!

383
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,467
‐Maya Sizitzy?
‐Don't change the subject!

384
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,537
Yes, I am currently in
Kabukicho, Shinjuku,

385
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,205
where the monster cocker‐oaches

386
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,740
have caused the greatest damage.

387
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,075
Just look at this disaster.

388
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:29,976
The cocker‐oaches,

389
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:32,311
which appeared suddenly
and reproduced abnormally,

390
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,447
are currently attacking
the entire city of Edo.

391
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,282
Oh dear, what will become
of the capital?

392
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,951
Is there a reason why
these alien cocker‐oaches

393
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,686
are concentrated in Kabukicho?

394
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:41,954
Prince Ka...

395
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,755
Prince Kaka?

396
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,256
You're doing that on purpose!

397
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,658
I hope you're enjoying yourself,

398
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,760
because I'm definitely going
to kill you later!

399
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,028
No...

400
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,596
I don't have to dirty my hands.

401
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,331
You're all about to die soon anyway.

402
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:53,899
<i>Listen to me.</i>

403
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,301
<i>The reason they're</i>
<i>all gathering there</i>

404
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,503
<i>is probably because the</i>
<i>queen is there too.</i>

405
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,606
They are all siblings born from
a single female cockroach.

406
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,642
First, the queen builds
her nest on a planet...

407
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,510
and then she lays a
large cache of eggs.

408
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,078
The hatchlings then proceed

409
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,114
to eat their way through
the entire planet.

410
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,584
They have already destroyed
many planets in this manner.

411
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,154
<i>As</i> <i>long</i> <i>as</i> <i>the</i> <i>queen</i> <i>exists,</i>
<i>they</i> <i>will</i> <i>continue</i> <i>to</i> <i>multiply.</i>

412
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,491
<i>At this rate, it will most certainly</i>
<i>be the end of this planet.</i>

413
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,059
So the only wa
to save ourselves

414
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,428
is to exterminate
the queen, is that it?

415
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,030
Is that what you're saying, Kaka?

416
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,197
Let's add the "Prince"!

417
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,600
Even if you're going to call me Kaka,
at least add the "Prince!"

418
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,636
Is there any way to tell the queen
apart from the other cockroaches?

419
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,771
Not really.

420
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,940
The size of their queen is same
as an ordinary Earth cockroach.

421
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,375
No, wait a minute.

422
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,411
There is one thing different about it.

423
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,579
And what could that be?

424
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,550
She has "GORO" written
on her back in Japanese.

425
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:45,584
What do you mean?

426
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,886
What does "GORO" mean?

427
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,554
It's just the name that I gave her.

428
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,589
That damn GORO running away
from her cage

429
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,692
after I took such good care of her.

430
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,093
What did you just say?

431
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:54,794
What?

432
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,462
Did I say something
I shouldn't have?

433
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:57,630
Oh...

434
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,333
They say it has "GORO"
written on its back.

435
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,635
Nope, no thanks.

436
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,470
We're done for,
it's the end of Earth.

437
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,172
You're making too much noise!

438
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,207
Keep it down, up there, you nimrods!

439
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,044
Get back!
Don't get any closer!

440
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,779
What the hell is going on?!

441
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,614
Is this "Revenge of the Roaches"
or what?

442
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,149
If I knew this was
going to happen,

443
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,686
I would've been a lot
nicer to roaches man!

444
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,855
Hey, Kagura, this is no time
to be sleeping.

445
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:23,856
Three cockroaches.

446
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,391
‐Four cockroaches.
‐Little Kagura!

447
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,258
‐Don't fall asleep
‐Five cockroaches.

448
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,326
‐counting cockroaches!
‐Six cockroaches.

449
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,062
You'll have a nightmare about being
locked up in a sticky, slimy room!

450
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,031
Hey Kagura, snap out of it!

451
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,201
It says "GORO" on its back!

452
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,602
It says "GORO"!
Got it?

453
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,204
it says "GORO" on its back!

454
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,606
So, if a cockroach with
"GORO" on its back

455
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,974
is exterminated,

456
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,343
<i>the other alien</i>
<i>cockroaches will all die.</i>

457
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,046
<i>The fate of Earth</i>
<i>is in your hands!</i>

458
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,647
What's this?

459
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,049
Why does it say "GORO?

460
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,550
Oh, man that's really weird.

461
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,019
I'd usually be too creeped
out to touch one of these...

462
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,955
but in these circumstances.

463
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,723
You're a lucky little fellow.

464
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,025
Saved by the skin of your antenna,
or something.

465
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,196
This damn well better be worth
some good karma.

466
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,732
Oh?

467
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,101
Hey, Gintoki!

468
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:10,402
I, Shinpachi...

469
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,403
have returned at last!

470
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,505
Shinpachi!

471
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,206
You're alive!
You're alive!

472
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,809
Did you actually think I could
be killed by a cockroach?

473
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,812
I went to buy an ultra‐powerful
bug spray.

474
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,548
I guess that karma stuff
really does work.

475
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:23,516
Hey, Gin!

476
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,117
Yes!

477
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,086
All right it pays to do good deeds.

478
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,288
These things are everywhere!!

479
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,556
The city is going crazy!

480
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:33,058
There are pickled seaweed cockroaches
crawling all over the streets.

481
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,393
We're in deep trouble.

482
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,595
If they find out it was our fault,
they'll chop our heads off.

483
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,364
There is a strange rumor
going around the city.

484
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,866
Something about these being
man eating cockroaches

485
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,202
that came from outer space to
take over the whole Earth.

486
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,471
And the world is doomed unless
we kill the queen cockroach,

487
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,439
with "GORO" written on
its back or something.

488
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,608
Man, people will believe anything!

489
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,510
Shinpachi...

490
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,878
say that again.

491
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,447
Like I said, these are
man‐eating cockroaches...

492
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,816
and unless we kill
the queen roach

493
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,250
that has "GORO"
written on its back,

494
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,952
the entire Earth is doomed.

495
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,687
Isn't that stupid or what?

496
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,793
That is pretty laughable.

497
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,894
I guess I'm...

498
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,163
the devil who destroyed
the entire world.

499
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,666
I can't do anything other than laugh.

500
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,668
You've seen it?

501
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,770
You saw the GORO roach!

502
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,674
I had it in my hand and then
I let it go and doomed Earth.

503
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,542
Wh‐Wh‐Where is it?

504
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,244
We have to find it right away.

505
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:26,145
It's no use.

506
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,479
It ran off somewhere.

507
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,747
Forget it.
Let's go eat steak.

508
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,850
Come on, Kagura, you can
eat all you want today.

509
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,819
We're gonna die, after all.

510
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,888
I basically just condemned
us all to death.

511
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,122
‐Kill me now.
‐Wait, hey Gin!

512
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,624
Pull yourself together!

513
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,858
‐Hey, Gin!
‐Kill me!

514
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,911
Excuse me everyone...

515
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,713
but please hear me out...

516
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,350
I assume the killer is flat broke.

517
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,051
So I think we should slap all
suspects with a fat stack of bills

518
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,686
‐until they spill the beans.
‐What's going on?

519
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:48,721
What's next week's story about?
