1
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,125
Don't give me that, you bastard!

2
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,860
Do you have any idea
what sort of a nuisance

3
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,595
your barbarism has
become around here?

4
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,998
Why don't you shut up, you old hag!

5
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,167
Why should I have to be
treated like this?

6
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,469
So I left my garbage's bin out,
no big deal!

7
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,605
Kabukicho is a place where the pure
and the dirty are mixed together,

8
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,840
and that is all the more reason

9
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,343
why you have to live according
to the rules around here!

10
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,711
That's what you say, granny,

11
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,747
but just last week, you left all of
your comic books out on the street.

12
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,015
Not me!

13
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,351
That was the idiotic stupid guy
who lives on the second floor!

14
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,186
‐You guys are making so much noise...
‐Don't you play dumb with me!

15
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,387
And don't get carried
away because

16
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,022
they call you the
Empress of Kabukicho!

17
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,825
Hey, down there, keep it quiet,
you two freaks!

18
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,160
Do you have any idea what time it is?

19
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,396
You're raising my blood pressure
with all your yelling!

20
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,398
Shut up, you lousy moptop loser!

21
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,534
Decent human beings have already
started their day by this hour!

22
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,471
You guys seriously think that
you're "human beings"?

23
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,940
I mean, maybe you were
a long time ago.

24
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,980
You're gonna pay for even thinking
you can talk back to me.

25
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,483
I'm taking him with me, Otose.

26
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,984
Go right ahead.

27
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,920
Shinpachi.

28
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,589
What kind of monster is that?

29
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,090
Well, uh...

30
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,825
just like our own Otose...

31
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,528
she's known as one of the
Elite Four of Kabukicho.

32
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,960
She's the Demoness Mademoiselle Saigo.

33
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,740
Hey girls, we have someone
new joining us today.

34
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,875
Meet Mopette.

35
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,745
Oh my, she's just so cute!

36
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,213
But why is she called Mopette?

37
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,748
Because she's got a moptop.

38
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,650
Give me a break, Mama.

39
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,119
She's going to steal
all of my customers.

40
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,522
I'm sorry, I have a stomach
ache so I'll be leaving early.

41
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,691
You can't escape that easily.

42
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,328
I am going to teach you exactly what
it takes to survive in Kabukicho.

43
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,497
No, that's really quite alright.

44
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,765
I already live here.

45
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,168
And I'm also going
to show you exactly

46
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,904
how noble all of us "freaks"
really are, Mopette.

47
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,006
Please come on and
just give me a break.

48
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,909
I'm the main character of
this show, you know.

49
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:35,582
Alright girls, teach the new girl
the ways of this business.

50
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,185
Huh?

51
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,355
What're you doing here, Cobra?

52
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,925
My name is Cobrette,
it is not Cobra.

53
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,729
Hey, Pops, are our noodles ready yet?

54
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,998
It'll be just a little bit longer.

55
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,300
A little bit longer?

56
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,901
Do you know how many
cup of noodles

57
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,003
I could've made
by now on my own?

58
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,072
Calm down, Elizabeth.

59
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,809
Recently the crackdown on lawless and
lordless samurai has gotten stricter.

60
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,579
Don't do anything that would attract
attention to us.

61
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,913
Here you go!

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,281
Damn you, old man!

63
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,718
Did you forget that we ordered our
noodles way before that guy, Pops?

64
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,420
Please forgive me, mister samurai.

65
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,789
But this is a very special customer.

66
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,357
Is it not your duty...

67
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,660
to treat each and every
customer equally?

68
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,496
Prepare to meet your maker!

69
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,831
Oh come on now, mister.

70
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,733
Don't get upset over
something like this.

71
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,768
So here, you can have mine.

72
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,770
Shut up, you damn freak!

73
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,770
Hey! Who are you calling a freak?

74
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,280
And, that's how I ended up here.

75
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:43,016
Since then, I've been looking
for a chance to escape, but...

76
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,185
Hey! Come on, shake your hips properly!

77
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,588
Cobra, you've been here way too long.

78
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,591
You might not be able to return
to the streets anymore.

79
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,826
Don't be ridiculous.

80
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,695
I have a solemn duty
to save my country!

81
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,431
I don't have time to waste
fooling around here like this.

82
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,167
Yeah, well I don't want
my country saved

83
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,170
by a guy who enjoys dancing
in a place like this every day.

84
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,604
Hey, you two!

85
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,274
Cobrette and Mopette,
your rhythm is way off.

86
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,710
Keep dancing like that, and you'll
make your customers upset!

87
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,179
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:15,348
This languid look is my
selling point, Jawnette.

89
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,184
Who are you calling Jawnette?

90
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,287
Mopette, I told you when I introduced you.

91
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,088
‐This is Jawnessa.
‐It's not Jawnessa!

92
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,890
It's Jawnny, you idiots!

93
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,859
Hey Mopette, Cobrette!

94
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,595
If you can't dance,
then help me out in the hall!

95
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,096
Why, hello there!

96
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,231
I'm Maneline.

97
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,632
And I'm Gaybriel.

98
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,100
I'm Mopette.

99
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,869
And I'm Cobrette.

100
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,405
Hey, hey, what is with those faces?

101
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,840
Does this place intend
to make me drunk?

102
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,875
Whoa!

103
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,410
I'm so shocked.

104
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,911
Hey, you with the mop‐top.

105
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,746
The reason I came here
in the first place

106
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,216
is to laugh at weirdoes like you, so...

107
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,918
Come on and do something funny,
you freaks!

108
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,887
What did you say, comb over baldy?

109
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,522
Do you want me to
pull out every last

110
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,657
stand of hope you
have on your head?

111
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,892
Stop it, Mopette.

112
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,627
Sir, I already told you...

113
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,195
that touching or
insulting the hostesses

114
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,631
is strictly forbidden here
in this establishment.

115
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,901
Don't try to make fools out of us!

116
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,177
"More majestic than women...

117
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,279
More dependable than men."

118
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,147
That's Mama's favorite phrase.

119
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,550
People like us, who are
somewhere in the middle...

120
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,453
need that kind of pride in order to
survive in this world.

121
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:29,923
We have to be stronger
than anyone or anything.

122
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,658
So are you strong too, Jawnette?

123
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,160
Can that jaw of yours
crush anything?

124
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,330
Why are you limiting
her strength to her jaw?

125
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,367
But Mademoiselle Saigo's
strength is extraordinary.

126
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,736
That's no ordinary person.

127
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,603
Yes.

128
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,172
I hear she used to be amazing
back in the day.

129
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:47,741
What was she called...?

130
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,875
Uh, the..

131
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,478
"White Loincloth Saigo,"
or something like that.

132
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,947
I don't know the exact extent
of his achievements,

133
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,148
but he was some kind of hero

134
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,285
who would go on a rampage wearing
nothing but a white loincloth.

135
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,954
With only that information,
he just sounds like a pervert.

136
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,189
White Loincloth Saigo...

137
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,158
I've heard that name
somewhere before...

138
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,893
‐Come on, fight me!
‐Hn?

139
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,562
Your dad's a dad,
but he's also your mom!

140
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,699
Maybe you're his son but you're
also his daughter, too!

141
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,934
That's why you're such a weakling!
Huh?

142
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,436
Ew!

143
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,271
Infectious bodily fluids!

144
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,073
Let's get out of here!

145
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,975
‐So gross!
‐Run!

146
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,610
This is disgusting!

147
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,879
Hey, kid.
Are you all right?

148
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,148
Te‐Teruhiko!

149
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,283
Teruhiko!

150
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,331
Teruhiko!

151
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,532
What happened to you?

152
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,000
You're hurt!
The hospital!

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,002
We have to get you to a hospital right
away!

154
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,171
Call Patch Adams!

155
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,473
I mean there's plenty of patchy
Adams around here...

156
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
I'm not talking to you jackasses!

157
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,276
Beat it!

158
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,346
They're just scratches,
so I'm okay, really Dad...

159
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,980
Don't call me Dad!

160
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,482
Call me your Mom!

161
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:07,187
Teruhiko, you've been coming home
all bruised up a lot lately.

162
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,489
What's been going on after school?

163
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,224
What are you hiding from me?

164
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,992
D‐Don't worry about it, Mom.

165
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,628
The thing is, I've just been playing
samurai with my friends

166
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,497
on the way home from school.

167
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,200
Okay, well I'm going out to play now.

168
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,668
Wait!
Just a minute!

169
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,937
Teruhiko!

170
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,306
Hm.

171
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,783
‐Hey, Kid.
‐Huh?

172
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,621
You forgot something.

173
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,062
Don't worry, kid.

174
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,097
I haven't shown it to your father.

175
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,299
But I'm wondering if I should have?

176
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,001
No.

177
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,336
Thank you, auntie.

178
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,005
My name is Katsura, not auntie.

179
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,208
Are you sure it's okay?

180
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,911
If your father doesn't come
to your school visit ?

181
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,013
I want him to come.

182
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,683
But you don't want to
be teased again?

183
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,118
I don't care about that.

184
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,486
I'm used to it.

185
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,755
But...

186
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,525
I don't want to see my Dad
get laughed at or hurt.

187
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,893
I really love him.

188
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,895
He can be a little scary at times...

189
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,496
but he's really funny.

190
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,898
And sometimes,

191
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:29,035
I just wish that my Dad was
just a normal dad, you know.

192
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,608
Mama, you're drinking
way too much!

193
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,510
What's gotten into you,
all of a sudden?

194
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,412
Leave her alone.

195
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,949
A man drinks until he's wasted,
then he can finally sleep.

196
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,851
Don't you mean to say "a woman"?

197
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,587
And a woman cries until she
cries herself to sleep!

198
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,989
Really, Mama, you should stop that now.

199
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,758
Mama and Mopette both.

200
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:57,363
The trouble is I know it's all my fault
soI really feel terrible for that boy.

201
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:58,364
Mm?

202
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,633
With a father like this, you know.

203
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,503
It would be strange if
they didn't pick on him.

204
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,873
So then, you do understand the situation.

205
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,008
That makes this a lot easier.

206
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,543
Hm.

207
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:15,181
Well, now you look like you're from
one of those anti‐social forces.

208
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,517
You need to look more
like a hopeless father.

209
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,786
Shall I draw a turd on your forehead?

210
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,655
What do you think you're doing?

211
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,993
Teruhiko's mother died before he
was old enough to remember.

212
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,630
And from then on, I had to fill the role
of his mother as well as his father.

213
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,866
I just went a bit too far with it.

214
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,603
<i>And</i> <i>I</i> <i>ended</i> <i>up</i> <i>like</i> <i>this,</i>
<i>but</i> <i>for</i> <i>that</i> <i>boy's</i> <i>sake...</i>

215
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,840
<i>I stuck to my principles, and I've</i>
<i>never once regretted my decision</i>

216
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,675
<i>not even for one moment.</i>

217
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,444
<i>Sure...</i>

218
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,747
<i>there will be those who laugh at</i>
<i>my ugly mug, but the truth is...</i>

219
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,716
<i>my spirit is stronger...</i>

220
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,853
stronger and more beautiful
than any man's or woman's.

221
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,792
Yo, look who came.

222
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,961
It's the weak little girly boy.

223
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,429
Stop saying that!

224
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,133
I am not weak at all,
and I'm going to prove it to you!

225
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,303
Gintoki, I'm gonna go back in there.

226
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:11,871
Huh?

227
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,007
Have you lost your mind, Cobrette?

228
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,410
I have to tell you, I'm worried
about that father and son.

229
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,178
Yeah but if you stay
here any longer,

230
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,948
you're really going to awaken
the other side of you.

231
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,484
That freak drunk himself to sleep,

232
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,653
so this is our only chance to escape.

233
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,655
We'll have other opportunities to run...

234
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,890
but there are things that can
only be done now.

235
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,425
Good luck, then, Cobrette.

236
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,328
I'll be praying that you don't spend
half of your life tucked away in here.

237
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,897
‐Hold on, Mopette.
‐Ow‐ow‐ow‐ow‐ow!

238
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,666
You're about to turn me into two halves!

239
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,067
Right down the middle!

240
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,835
What is it with you, huh?

241
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,571
Just do what you want by yourself!

242
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,105
Com'on, what're you saying, Mopette?

243
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,875
Haven't we always fought together
as the top tag‐team?

244
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:50,376
Hell if I know!

245
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,712
The food wasn't great,
but we still ate the food

246
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,714
that Saigo provided us, didn't we?

247
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,249
We must return the favor.

248
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,418
Isn't that the way of a samurai?

249
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,620
You're saying samurai
should get involved in a kid's fight?

250
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,222
No way!
This is seriously messed up, Yo!

251
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,124
Not my problem!

252
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,593
It was all his idea!

253
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,135
Ow‐ow‐ow.
What're you doing?

254
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,270
Let me go!

255
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,905
You guys are gross and disgusting!

256
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,373
Cobrette, he says you're gross.

257
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,474
What're you talking about?

258
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,176
He meant you, Mopette.

259
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,446
No, he meant you,
Mr. Translucent white face.

260
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,847
Go play outside some more.

261
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:28,715
What about you?

262
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,283
Your face just shouts, "I'm poor!

263
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,385
Give me back the lunch
money that you stole."

264
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,621
Just so you know, it's not
our fault at all.

265
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,757
We tried to stop him, we really did,
but he did it on his own.

266
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,093
I don't get what you're trying to say.

267
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,729
So tell us the details,
or I'll shave your head.

268
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,597
It was a test of courage.

269
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,367
There's a test of courage
popular among kids.

270
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,403
When we teased him about it,
he took it seriously and...

271
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,305
An abandoned house?

272
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,906
It's not just an abandoned house.

273
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,441
There's something in there.

274
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,244
The other day, we heard a creepy
growl coming from inside.

275
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,412
Like it was a beast.

276
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,681
Yeah, there's definitely
something in there.

277
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,120
A haunted house, eh?

278
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,023
Hey, Cobra, you're pretty amazing.

279
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,525
How'd you make it through
such a narrow opening?

280
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,860
This isn't happening.

281
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,762
You can't be serious?
No way!

282
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,530
What're you doing, are you stuck in there?

283
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,767
Listen, I can't move forwards or backwards
at all.

284
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,934
Mopette...

285
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,636
this is why they call you Mu‐ppete.

286
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,837
What was that, you bastard?

287
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,806
Help me, or I'll mop your face.

288
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,708
‐Ow‐ow‐ow.
‐Come on, loosen up.

289
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,410
It's no use.
Ow!

290
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,444
Just leave me here.

291
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,546
I'll just live here from now on!

292
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:51,998
There's something in there.

293
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,733
Something unnatural...

294
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,435
Teruhiko?

295
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,036
That's' you isn't it, Teruhiko?

296
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,838
Please say that you're Teruhiko!

297
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,473
You bastard!

298
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,608
Are you just going to just leave me here?!

299
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,911
You told me that you wanted to live there,
right?

300
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,546
Don't worry.
I'll be right back.

301
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,847
I'll buy you a cheesecake.

302
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,482
I'll buy you a cheesecake!

303
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,517
What would I use a cheesecake for?

304
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,719
Cobrette!

305
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,588
Haven't we always fought together
as the top tag‐team, up until now?

306
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,622
Hell if I know!

307
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,323
I know!
That's it!

308
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,992
I'll give you my leather jacket with
"Samurai" printed on the back.

309
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,260
It's what you always wanted!

310
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,796
Who'd want to wear a
tacky jacket like that?

311
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,700
What are you two
humans doing there?

312
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,037
Oh, I see.

313
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,507
So a child came in here and hasn't
returned since, you say?

314
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,909
And you came here to find him, huh?

315
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,345
Recently we've had a lot of kids
coming into the yard

316
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,614
and causing all kinds of mischief.

317
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,984
See that tree over there by the annex?

318
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,253
Kids claim that if they can
fetch fruit from that tree,

319
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,455
it proves they are a real samurai.

320
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,358
It's just like children
think up such silly things.

321
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,428
So then are you telling us that
this yard belongs to you, Squirt?

322
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,630
Who the hell are you calling "squirt"?

323
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,567
Do you two have any idea just
who this squirt actually is?

324
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,735
Stop it, G.

325
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,804
Father said that although we
come from different planets,

326
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,672
we should always be kind
to all beautiful women.

327
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,974
Have you forgotten that?

328
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,510
My Prince, you mustn't
be fooled by them.

329
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,847
After all your father said, he ended up
marrying a butt ugly woman.

330
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,583
Hey! That's my mother you're
talking about right out!

331
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,818
My mother!
Huh?

332
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,653
Hey, you, you there.

333
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,090
Haven't we met somewhere before?

334
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,993
No way, how gross!

335
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,694
Is that a pickup line from space?

336
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,830
You'll never get any women
in Edo city that way, baldy.

337
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,098
Go trip on a knife.

338
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,032
I see.

339
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,501
I thought we met
somewhere before, but...

340
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,071
Well, I can't ignore a damsel
in distress so.

341
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,774
How about we assist them
in their search, right, G?

342
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,342
Hey G?

343
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:46,379
Um, I will pass.

344
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,581
I have a lacrosse match at 4 o'clock.

345
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:49,749
You old fart.

346
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,884
I'll help you lacrosse
over to the other side.

347
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,120
Listen, Prince, there's something
I'd like to ask you.

348
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,589
There's a rumor going around
among the children

349
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,724
that a monster lives here in this yard.

350
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,726
Any idea what that monster might be?

351
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,097
What was that?
That monstrous growl?

352
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,232
Something's coming.

353
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,967
Something's coming for sure this time!

354
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,470
Huh?

355
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,372
Oh, Buddy, show me some love.

356
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,209
Is this adorable pet the monster you're
referring to?

357
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,211
Buddy is not a monster at all.

358
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,514
You're in the yard that I prepared
for my pet, Buddy.

359
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,683
I bought this abandoned
samurai mansion,

360
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,018
and turned it into Buddy's playground.

361
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,254
You don't have to worry one bit.

362
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,556
Buddy wouldn't hurt a child.

363
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,792
‐Right, Buddy?
‐Excuse me.

364
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,628
But may I be permitted to pet him as well?

365
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,296
Hey, don't touch that thing!

366
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,632
Oh!
Good boy, good boy.

367
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,067
What are you afraid of?

368
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,401
He certainly has a big body,

369
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,805
but such a lovable animal
wouldn't hurt anyone at all.

370
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,074
Look, this big guy's an angel.

371
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,080
No way!

372
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,816
It's an angel and a devil
both rolled into one!

373
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,719
An angel and a devil dancing
cheek to cheek!

374
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,656
Buddy is an unusual species
that I found on a remote planet.

375
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,891
The bottom part is fake,

376
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:08,461
and animals lured in by this cute
face get eaten by the main part.

377
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,296
What a fabulous organism!

378
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,733
And we're in exactly that situation,
aren't we?

379
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,368
It's just fine.

380
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,702
Buddy only eats salami.

381
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,970
Right, precious?

382
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,210
He's, you know, playing.

383
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,711
He's just playing.
Seriously.

384
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,647
‐That's all.
‐No way!

385
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,516
He just ate your important‐looking
thingy on your head!

386
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,452
I'm fine, I tell you.
It will grow back.

387
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,621
<i>Look out!</i>

388
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,556
<i>This isn't funny!</i>

389
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,658
Yo, this doesn't sound good.
It's going to get those people, too.

390
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,293
‐Yeah!
‐Yo!

391
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,294
Where're you going?

392
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,461
Hey, Yo!

393
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,342
Aunties!

394
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,577
Hey, Aunties.

395
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,478
Just hang in there, Aunties!

396
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:03,482
Hey.

397
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,884
You okay, there, kid?

398
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,053
You really had us worried.

399
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,187
Tell me, are you hurt?

400
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,723
Well, I could ask you the same question,
don't you think?

401
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,192
Cobra, you really are in sorry shape.

402
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,727
Where'd you put your body?

403
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,996
Well, you're just an exposed
head yourself.

404
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,531
May you rest in peace.

405
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,999
Shinpachi!
Kagura!

406
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:20,766
Sadaharu!

407
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,601
‐Farewell world!
‐Just calm down.

408
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,737
The two of you have just
been buried, that's all.

409
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:25,671
I see.

410
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,740
There's nothing to worry about,
we've come to save you.

411
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,475
Or should I say, please save us.

412
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,277
What did you even come
here for, aunties?

413
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,445
Never mind that.

414
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,879
How did you survive here?

415
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,216
Well. I was hiding up in
a tree the whole time.

416
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,251
<i>I was too scared to</i>
<i>come back down,</i>

417
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,154
<i>and then I saw you being</i>
<i>carried off by that thing.</i>

418
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,857
That Buddy, he learned
a brand new trick.

419
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,158
How sweet.

420
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,861
My Prince, Buddy does this
when he wants to store

421
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,197
his food for later, you realize.

422
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,400
What're you going to do about this,
you idiot prince?

423
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,003
My life and my lacrosse
match are both over!

424
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,671
Shut up, you old fart!

425
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,507
If we get out of this,
I'm definitely firing you!

426
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,575
Go right ahead.

427
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,644
We're all going to die here anyway.

428
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,546
I'm sorry, everybody.

429
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,615
It's my all fault this happened.

430
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,084
What am I doing?

431
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,021
I've caused so much
trouble for everyone.

432
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,757
How is this going to prove
to anyone that I'm not weak.

433
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,525
<i>But...</i>

434
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,161
<i>I was so angry that everyone</i>
<i>made fun of my Dad.</i>

435
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,296
<i>My Dad is the way he is,</i>

436
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:28,260
<i>but I know that he has a spirit</i>
<i>stronger and purer than anyone else.</i>

437
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,269
<i>But no one ever sees that.</i>

438
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,138
<i>They don't even try.</i>

439
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,574
It makes me so angry.

440
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,243
I'm so frustrated.

441
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,844
Listen, you.

442
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,150
He's coming!

443
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,653
Buddy, if you're gonna eat
one of us, eat G, here!

444
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,188
I'm all fat and bad for your health!

445
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,623
What are you saying, Prince?

446
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,826
If you eat me, my bones will
stick in your throat for sure!

447
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,194
Eat the Prince!

448
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:57,163
Hey!
Hey!

449
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,164
He's coming this way!

450
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,964
That's enough, kid!

451
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,666
Forget about us and run away!

452
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,401
You'll be killed, too, kid!

453
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,036
Hey!
Are you listening to us?

454
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,104
Shut up!

455
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,073
I'm strong!
And I won't run away!

456
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,774
This is not the time to be saying that!

457
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:09,842
Hurry up and run!

458
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,821
Yes, you are strong.

459
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,958
‐But we already knew that!
‐But we already knew that!

460
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,028
You and your dad...
you are both men...

461
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,263
of tremendoulsy strong spirit.

462
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,399
You think nobody can see that?

463
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,366
Don't be stupid!

464
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,202
Those who can see that, they see it.

465
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,436
Always!

466
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,606
At the very least, there are two
men right here who can see it.

467
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,841
Remember that.

468
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,075
Auntie...

469
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,211
Hmph, talking as if you understand.

470
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,594
M‐Mom!

471
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,482
I remember now.

472
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,684
<i>Back during the Amanto invasion,</i>
<i>there was a man</i>

473
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,453
<i>who wore nothing but</i>
<i>a white loincloth</i>

474
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,088
<i>to storm the enemy battleship.</i>

475
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,589
<i>He fought until that white loincloth</i>

476
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,591
<i>was stained crimson with</i>
<i>the blood of the enemy.</i>

477
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,226
<i>His exploits are legend.</i>

478
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,960
<i>Saigo, the White Loincloth Demon Lord.</i>

479
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,648
He's our great samurai pioneer, Saigo!

480
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,019
M‐Mom, I'm so sorry.

481
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,520
I...

482
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:03,956
You idiot!

483
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,392
Right now, call me dad,
it's dad to you.

484
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,128
Hey.

485
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,529
You two are fired.

486
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,065
You still can't dance, and no
matter how much you practice,

487
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,266
you're hopeless.

488
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,336
If you ever call us freaks again,
I won't go easy on you.

489
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,105
And one other thing...

490
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,876
If you're ever feeling down,
come and visit the club.

491
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:27,513
We'll treat you to
some special service.

492
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,719
He scares me.

493
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,988
Looks like we didn't need
to worry at all, huh?

494
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,058
They're no different than samurai,
are they.

495
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,994
They have a path of their own to follow.

496
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,231
<i>My Father & My Mother...</i>

497
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:49,702
My mother is my mother, but my
mother is also my father.

498
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,106
<i>Rather, my father is actually my father,</i>
<i>but she's also my mother.</i>

499
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,842
<i>My Mother has a lot of ladies...</i>

500
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:00,212
<i>flying around hewho like to call</i>
<i>themselves butterflies...</i>

501
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,681
<i>but they're really more like moths.</i>

502
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:05,584
<i>However, they're all really good people...</i>

503
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,988
<i>and I think their spirits are more</i>
<i>beautiful than anyone else's.</i>

504
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,495
<i>Mom, everyone, I hope you all remain</i>
<i>wonderful moths forever.</i>

505
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,565
<i>I love you all exactly the way you are.</i>

506
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,567
<i>The end.</i>

507
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,571
Hey, you know.

508
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,139
I should stop coming to Earth.

509
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,160
<i>Gin, Gin!</i>

510
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,796
<i>It's the six month anniversary</i>
<i>since our show started!</i>

511
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,164
<i>Really?</i>
<i>Is that so?</i>

512
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,666
<i>We have to celebrate!</i>

513
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:01,867
<i>Oh, celebrate?</i>

514
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,869
<i>Shall we go and splurge</i>
<i>on a hotpot, then?</i>

515
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,637
<i>The next episode...</i>
