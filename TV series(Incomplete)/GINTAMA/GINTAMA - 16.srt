1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,736
<i>When watching Gintama,</i>

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:04,538
<i>please keep the lights on</i>

3
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:06,406
<i>and don't sit</i>
<i>too close to the TV!</i>

4
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,102
<i>‐You can't catch me.</i>
‐Hey there, pops.

5
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,471
<i>Come and get me.</i>

6
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,109
‐So, what's up little Odd Jobs girl?
<i>‐Your turn.</i>

7
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,380
Why are you always here
in the middle of the day

8
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,415
when grown ups
are all working, pops?

9
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,887
That is because...

10
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,790
I was actually fired
from my job.

11
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,028
So what was the reason

12
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,297
that you were fired
from your job, pops?

13
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,966
Well, it's because...

14
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:19,439
It's because I blindly followed
my heart without thinking ahead.

15
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,109
You should be careful
not to be too reckless in life

16
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,544
just because you're young
too, little girl.

17
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,015
Because life is very long,
you know.

18
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,984
I really don't want to hear that
from a loser like you.

19
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,256
See you,
dumb old repulsive kook!

20
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,025
Aka dork!

21
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,028
Let's go, Sadaharu.

22
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,203
Man, kids these days, huh?

23
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,473
Oh, whoa, that's weird.

24
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,442
Everything's blurry.
I can't see.

25
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,344
<i>If you stop</i>
<i>and think about it,</i>

26
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,580
<i>your life's a lot longer</i>
<i>as an old guy than a kid!</i>

27
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,681
<i>Whoa, Scary!</i>

28
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,621
<i>See you, dumb old</i>
<i>repulsive kook!</i>

29
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,289
<i>Aka dork!</i>

30
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,326
<i>A dork, that name</i>
<i>really fits me,</i>

31
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,961
<i>far better than it should.</i>

32
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,932
<i>Until just a little while ago</i>

33
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,968
<i>I was sprinting down</i>
<i>the path to success.</i>

34
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,871
<i>If only I hadn't made</i>

35
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,506
<i>that one reckless error.</i>

36
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,776
<i>The next day, I was summoned</i>
<i>by my boss.</i>

37
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,179
<i>Cut your guts out.</i>

38
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,313
<i>Seriously?</i>

39
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,283
<i>My boss ordered me</i>
<i>to commit harakiri,</i>

40
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,417
<i>and I was scared.</i>

41
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,787
<i>So I was going leave</i>
<i>everyone behind and bail.</i>

42
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,793
<i>But as it turned out,</i>
<i>my wife left me first.</i>

43
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,462
<i>I can't stand by a dork‐h,</i>

44
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:51,498
<i>(a dumb old repulsive kook husband)</i>
<i>like you anymore.</i>

45
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,234
<i>I'm sorry, but I'm leaving.</i>
<i>Hatsu.</i>

46
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,871
<i>I lost absolutely</i>
<i>everything in life.</i>

47
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,442
<i>The only thing I had left</i>
<i>were these black sunglasses.</i>

48
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,078
<i>Well, I lost everything,</i>

49
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,280
<i>but I did gain</i>
<i>something else in return.</i>

50
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:08,882
Yo!

51
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,118
Here again, huh?

52
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,352
How's it going?

53
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,253
You winning at all today?

54
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,455
A very strange acquaintance.

55
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,892
You know, a guy your age
just passing the time

56
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:22,229
at this place every
single day is as sad

57
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,532
as the ice cream that gets left
on the lid of the container.

58
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,633
And what about you?

59
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,301
Do you also have
nothing better to do

60
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,404
than hang around here
during the day all the time?

61
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,374
Well, when people can't get
enough sugar in their bloodstream,

62
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,943
they start to not know
what to do anymore.

63
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,044
So, when that happens,

64
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,080
watching small balls
popping around like this

65
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,448
makes me feel a lot better.

66
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,682
It's very simple.

67
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,452
<i>It's said that birds</i>
<i>of a feather flock together.</i>

68
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,455
<i>But I really felt like</i>
<i>this guy was just like me,</i>

69
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,423
<i>particularly the way</i>
<i>he didn't have any guarantee</i>

70
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,259
<i>of fulfilling his basic needs.</i>

71
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,628
I feel like I'll win today!

72
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,330
Ah? You're leaving already?

73
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,567
Actually, I've got a job interview
to go to today.

74
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,136
Oh, wow, you're actually
making a serious effort.

75
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,738
Kind of.
See you.

76
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,874
Man, is my lucky streak
already over?

77
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:11,745
<i>That's right.</i>

78
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:15,615
<i>I really needed to start something</i>
<i>brand new in my life at this point.</i>

79
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,084
<i>I know that I'm a dork,</i>

80
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,986
<i>but I should at least</i>
<i>become a far better man</i>

81
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,721
<i>than I've been until now.</i>

82
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,634
What the frick?!

83
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,503
Stop surprising me,
old man!

84
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,739
But I'm the one
that was surprised by you.

85
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,510
I was just going
to offer you a light.

86
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,979
Oh, uh... thanks a lot.

87
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,380
I'm just really nervous, man.

88
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,381
It's upside down, man!

89
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,016
I mean, how nervous
can you be?!

90
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,184
Sorry, sorry.

91
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,220
It's the first time I've been
to this kind of place.

92
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,190
My girl is been providing for me
up until this point.

93
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,226
But now, the thing is,
she's pregnant

94
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,127
and uh... she's due
pretty soon.

95
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,398
So, I thought I should
be a man...

96
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,635
and get a real job
to provide for the family!

97
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,905
Hey, hey, it's burning!

98
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:12,706
It's burning!

99
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,108
Yeah, a flame of responsibility

100
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,444
has been ignited
deep within my heart!

101
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:18,278
No, not that!

102
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,779
Your head is totally
on fire, man!

103
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:20,780
Take a look!

104
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,517
Oh... oh, my God!

105
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,886
What do I do?

106
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,554
Water! Water! Water!

107
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,123
Mr. Shoji Endo, it's time
for your interview.

108
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,891
Damn you're fired up!

109
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,060
Look, my wife is taking care
of the housework!

110
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,563
From now on, I've decided
I'll earn money for my family!

111
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,465
<i>You're fired uuuup!</i>

112
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,152
Oh, hey!

113
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,256
<i>Compared to this guy,</i>

114
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,259
my responsibilities
as a dork are small.

115
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,029
I'm Taizo Hasegawa.

116
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,597
It's very good to meet you.

117
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,333
Hasegawa?

118
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,036
Mr. Hasegawa, is that you?!

119
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:19,172
You... you are from the Department
of Immigration Control?

120
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,273
I'm Onishi!

121
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,642
I never thought I'd see you
in a place like this!

122
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,412
So, what are you doing here,
Mr. Hasegawa?

123
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,614
Well, I've had a lot
of problems recently,

124
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,617
but I'm glad to know that
you're working for this company

125
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,886
and I wonder if you can
put in a good word for me

126
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,487
with your boss
for old time's...

127
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,856
Are you freaking kidding me?!

128
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,125
O... Onishi?

129
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,461
You're a bastard, Hasegawa!

130
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,897
Thanks for everything
you did for me

131
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,599
while I was working at the Department
of Immigration Control!

132
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,537
Hey, I didn't have any choice at
the time, because of my boss.

133
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,671
You shut up!

134
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,441
If you want to work here,
you'd better bow down before me

135
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,876
and shave off
that stupid goatee, buddy!

136
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,446
Shave my goatee?

137
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:00,880
You got a problem with that?

138
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,249
And take off those shades
while you're at it, batbrains!

139
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,418
No, anything but my sunglasses!

140
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,355
You don't have a job, but you still
want to have a style, huh?

141
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,423
You know what you are?

142
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:14,294
A dumb old repulsive kooky geek,
aka you're a dork‐g!

143
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,263
<i>Now get out!!!</i>

144
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,568
<i>Everything has been going</i>
<i>utterly wrong since then.</i>

145
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,170
<i>Can you do something</i>
<i>about your hair</i>

146
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,106
<i>and those stupid sunglasses?</i>

147
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,208
<i>They make you look</i>
<i>like a dork!</i>

148
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,777
<i>And I mean, a drowsy</i>
<i>old repulsive kook.</i>

149
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:35,315
<i>It's just, your breath stinks</i>
<i>and your sunglasses are kind of...</i>

150
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,084
<i>You're a degraded</i>
<i>old repulsive kook,</i>

151
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,719
<i>in other words, a dork!</i>

152
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,156
<i>No matter where I go,</i>
<i>I hear the words dork.</i>

153
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,825
Hey, there, chef!

154
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,895
What's this disgusting overcooked
rotten kefir flavored stock?!

155
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,764
In short, it is dorks!

156
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,435
What's wrong with
being a dork?!

157
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,041
<i>Times like these call</i>
<i>for a drink or ten.</i>

158
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,177
You know, the area
around my heart

159
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,679
has been hurting like
it's being stabbed recently.

160
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,381
Is this what they call
love sickness?

161
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,151
You should probably
see a doctor, Mr. Mu.

162
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,186
Get home safely.

163
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,791
Oh, welcome.
Good evening.

164
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,799
Hey, we're about
to close up.

165
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,300
It's time for you to leave.

166
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,104
Can't you let me drink
a little bit more?

167
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,574
I'm trying to bury the harsh
realities that weigh heavily

168
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,576
on my stomach in the
bottom of these bottles.

169
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,745
Just make sure
you don't spill all the food

170
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,115
that's weighting heavily on your
stomach across the bar counter.

171
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,651
Come on, take off your sunglasses
and wake up.

172
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,019
Leave me alone.

173
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,787
I'm just fine, I'm fine!

174
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,056
Are you serious, man?

175
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,193
You're a drunk old recovering
knocked down customer.

176
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,495
In short, a dork‐c.

177
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,698
<i>Come on, fellows,</i>
<i>check it out!</i>

178
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,000
Whatever, I don't care, dork.

179
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,968
<i>Check it out!</i>

180
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,169
Hey, brother!

181
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,004
I know the perfect bar for you.

182
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,707
I guess I don't have
anything left to lose.

183
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,743
Nice to meet you.

184
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,178
My name is Otae.

185
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,013
Hey, this place looks
really expensive,

186
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,749
but you know I really
don't have much money.

187
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,885
Is that so?
That's totally fine.

188
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,987
Excuse me!
One French Champagne!

189
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,956
What?
Didn't she get a word I said?!

190
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,724
Does she not speak
my language or what?

191
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,559
Can I have an interpreter,
please?!

192
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:27,961
Come on, sir.

193
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,464
Your watch, your ring, and your
sunglasses look pretty expensive.

194
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,565
So, why don't you
go sell them?

195
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,167
No, not my sunglasses!

196
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,902
Is this a highway robbery pub?

197
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,171
You're being so stubborn
about this, you know.

198
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,907
You're a diehard older
rigid kind of man.

199
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,610
In short, you are known
as a dork, sir.

200
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,311
Hold on right there!

201
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,913
Are you trying to say,
if I weren't so stubborn,

202
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,983
I would become a desirable old
and respectful kind hearted man?

203
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,584
So I'd still be a dork?!

204
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,758
So anyway, what would you
like to order, sir?

205
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,195
One French champagne,
if you please.

206
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,097
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
<i>Good night!</i>

207
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,741
Man, it's almost dawn already.

208
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,342
Hey, you, hold up a second.

209
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:17,610
What's that?

210
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,445
What does a monk
want from me?

211
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,682
My name is Katsura,
and I'm not a monk.

212
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,117
I know this is pretty sudden,

213
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,219
but would you be interested
in taking up a sword with me

214
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,321
and venturing out for
the dawning of Japan?

215
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,657
What the hell are you talking about
this early in the morning?

216
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,931
Katsura, you bastard!

217
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,933
Be prepared to meet your demise!

218
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,868
It's the Shinsengumi!

219
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,769
Let's retreat for now.

220
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,204
‐Hold on! What the hell this is about, bro?
‐Katsura, come back!

221
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,407
My name is Katsura,

222
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,075
and I’m not your bro!

223
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,944
All right, Katsura!

224
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,478
I know already!

225
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,182
This is not my day!

226
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,988
It is time for you to pay
for your sins, bomber!

227
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,757
Oh, I'm screwed.

228
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,226
Come on!
Why don't you confess?

229
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,762
I already told you,
I have nothing to do with it.

230
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,164
You have nothing to do with it?

231
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,300
Okay, fine, just tell us
where Katsura is and you can go.

232
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,302
Human language,
do you guys speak it?

233
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,236
Listen, man.

234
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,505
You have no documentation
to prove who you are,

235
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,940
and all you say is:
"I'm not involved."

236
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,409
That's the living definition
of suspicious.

237
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,511
I told you,
my name is Hasegawa,

238
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,947
and I used to work at the Department
of Immigration Control.

239
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,415
You'd know if you checked!

240
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,352
If you are going to lie, at least
make it a believable one.

241
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,887
I'm being serious!
You can even check it out!

242
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,289
Then, lets strip you down

243
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,991
and make sure you are
who you say you are!

244
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:38,891
Take off your sunglasses.

245
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,627
‐Come here!
‐Hold on just a minute!

246
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,428
Not my sunglasses, no way!

247
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,630
Preferably not my clothes either,

248
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,164
but seriously,
I really used to work

249
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,333
at the Department
of Immigration Control!

250
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,903
Well, you know you're a deceiving
overprotected red handed kook.

251
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,805
In short, you are a dork.

252
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,007
<i>‐Investigation room.</i>
<i>‐No, not those!</i>

253
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,341
<i>‐Take your clothes off now!</i>
<i>‐As it turns out...</i>

254
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,343
<i>‐...I'm a dork no matter where I go.</i>
<i>‐Give up, old man!</i>

255
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,445
<i>Don't you ever</i>
<i>come back here!</i>

256
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,781
<i>I guess we got up early</i>
<i>this morning for nothing.</i>

257
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,216
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

258
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,820
<i>Now, the only thing I have left</i>
<i>in life are these sunglasses.</i>

259
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,255
Damn it!

260
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,457
Would you listen to me
for just once in your life?

261
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,192
Oh, hey man.

262
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,761
What are you doing here then?

263
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,665
<i>So your interviews</i>
<i>went south again, huh?</i>

264
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,267
<i>Yeah, I failed at every last one.</i>

265
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,170
<i>Not only that, but I had to deal</i>
<i>with so many weirdos.</i>

266
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,240
Every last one of them
would called me a dork

267
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,475
and told me to take
off my sunglasses.

268
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,277
These sunglasses are a part
of my face.

269
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,012
They don't come off, man.

270
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,784
You Idiot!

271
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,553
Stop blaming everything
on your sunglasses!

272
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,523
Blaming a rock when you trip over
it doesn't change anything!

273
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:44,657
Just take them off!

274
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,994
Yes, all you need to do
is take off your sunglasses.

275
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,097
So, are you telling me
to become a sell out now?

276
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,400
Do you think I can change
myself at this stage of my life?

277
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:56,636
That's enough.

278
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:57,637
Sit down.

279
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:58,938
Hey, Master Chef.

280
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,674
Give him something that
reminds him of his mama's cooking.

281
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,376
<i>‐Now how the hell would I know that?</i>
<i>‐Dumpling soup.</i>

282
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,944
<i>Did you not have</i>
<i>a mother growing up?</i>

283
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,746
<i>Just get us some</i>
<i>digestive biscuits!</i>

284
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,648
<i>What kind of mother</i>
<i>did you have?!</i>

285
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,317
Listen, Hasegawa.

286
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,221
It's okay to have your own
values and rules that you live by,

287
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,989
but if they aren't helping
you be happy

288
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,624
or get where you want to be

289
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,328
maybe its time to re‐evaluate
your values and beliefs.

290
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,166
You gotta be open to
different ways to do things,

291
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,768
and explore all the possibilities,

292
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,037
and eventually, you'll be able
to figure out what it is

293
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,606
that is truly important to you
and your happiness.

294
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,244
<i>You can worry about your sunglasses</i>
<i>after all that, you know.</i>

295
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,780
<i>I am...</i>

296
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,814
<i>Who am I?</i>

297
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,729
My name is Taizo Hasegawa.

298
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,598
It's very nice to meet you.

299
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,502
I've finally lost
my sunglasses, too.

300
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,671
So, what kind of work did you do
before, Mr. Hasegawa?

301
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,908
I was fighting against evil aliens
in order to save the Earth.

302
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,878
You're very funny.

303
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,812
You're hired.

304
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,382
<i>I didn't realize that just</i>
<i>taking off my sunglasses</i>

305
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,417
<i>could make this much</i>
<i>difference in my life.</i>

306
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,853
<i>I hate having young people</i>
<i>tell me what to do,</i>

307
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,589
<i>but people are more</i>
<i>than just their age in life.</i>

308
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,126
<i>There are people in this world</i>
<i>who've been alive for a lot less time</i>

309
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,129
<i>than I have yet experienced</i>
<i>a lot more in their time.</i>

310
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,199
<i>Hello, sir.</i>
<i>Where to?</i>

311
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,334
Don't simply call him sir!

312
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,136
Call him Captain!

313
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,238
Cut it out, you guys!

314
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,774
I'm very sorry about that, driver.

315
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,576
Please take us
to the Cultural Center.

316
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,611
All right, Captain.

317
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,816
<i>Hurry up! Otsu's live concert</i>
<i>is about to start very soon!</i>

318
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,284
<i>Oh, yes sir, Captain!</i>

319
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,718
<i>I'm not the Captain!!</i>

320
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,086
<i>I am a sergeant!</i>

321
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,823
‐L‐O‐V‐E O‐TSU!
<i>‐Through my work as a taxi driver...</i>

322
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,191
<i>‐I realize...</i>
‐Alright!

323
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,327
<i>...how great it is</i>
<i>to have a destination.</i>

324
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,197
Thank you, the back
from The Dead Salon.

325
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,265
<i>‐I had so many customers.</i>
‐To the hospital, please.

326
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,934
<i>‐And each and everyone of them had...</i>
‐To Kabukicho, thank you.

327
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,235
<i>...a clear vision.</i>

328
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,937
To Kabukicho, sir.

329
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,471
<i>My life has definitely changed.</i>

330
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,207
Drive until I see the dawn
of a new Japan.

331
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,309
<i>But your boy's lost sight</i>
<i>of his destination.</i>

332
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,345
Do you see the skuzzy looking guy
who is smoking over there?

333
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,647
Run him over,
just enough to not kill him.

334
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,517
<i>What's going to happen</i>
<i>to me now, I wonder?</i>

335
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,253
<i>Where should I go in life,</i>
<i>I wonder?</i>

336
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,291
<i>It seems like I am the only one</i>
<i>who has no destination in life.</i>

337
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:36,329
<i>I am... I am... I am...!</i>

338
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,632
I don't care where we go,
just take me somewhere.

339
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,735
<i>There's one, a lost soul,</i>
<i>just like me.</i>

340
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,337
I'm really bored, man.

341
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,405
Just drive me around
for free, would you?

342
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,673
Stop screwing around!

343
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,375
I'm not doing this for fun.

344
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,010
Don't be like that, man.

345
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,446
I just want to see
the other side of the horizon.

346
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,548
Who do you think
you are, my girlfriend?

347
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,416
So then, how's your new job going?

348
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,919
It was fine until
you got in my taxi.

349
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,955
You looked like a walking corpse
when I saw you the other day,

350
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,458
but I think you look
slightly better today, man.

351
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,526
As if... really?

352
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,460
Nothing has changed.

353
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,861
I changed my job,
that's all.

354
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,529
But I still don't have
a purpose.

355
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,498
I don't have a clear vision
for my future.

356
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,233
I have no destination.

357
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,636
Everyone's in that same boat, man.

358
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,070
Just keep crawling
through the mud,

359
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,773
and you'll find
a destination eventually.

360
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,742
I really don't think
that's how it works.

361
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:23,876
Because in this show,
at least,

362
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,345
you and I are the only ones
with soulless eyes.

363
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:28,614
<i>Hey, its a customer.</i>

364
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,283
<i>Time to get out</i>
<i>of my car, asshole!</i>

365
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,292
What is he doing here?
What is he doing here?

366
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,459
Start the car right now!

367
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,428
I don't want any trouble today!

368
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,264
I want you to take me
to the Ueno Zoo.

369
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,566
And make it snappy.

370
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,536
Haven't I seen the two of you
somewhere before?

371
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,837
I don't think you would have.

372
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:52,571
Who are you?

373
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,141
That thing on your head,
isn't that a bit indecent?

374
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,976
Like some believe
the Earth itself is,

375
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,744
since we all have
the same flat faces.

376
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,013
I guess so.
Never mind then!

377
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,083
Well then, Mr. Hasegawa,
I have a knitting class to get to!

378
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,384
Have a nice day!

379
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,485
Hey, wait!

380
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,154
Please don't leave me!

381
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,289
Please don’t leave me
all alone like this!

382
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,092
I'd die from loneliness
if you leave me!

383
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,694
What are you, a hamster?!

384
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,829
<i>Hey, just start the damn car!</i>

385
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,397
<i>Yes, I'm so sorry.</i>

386
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,116
It seems like
he doesn't remember us,

387
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,418
so we should be fine if we get him
to his destination quickly,

388
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,419
and then get the hell out.

389
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:41,854
Then why do you need me?

390
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,155
Let me go.

391
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,924
Nope, me scared,
me lonely!

392
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,993
Why are you speaking
like a foreigner now?

393
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,996
That damned Jii gets
his driver's license suspended

394
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,931
after all his years of driving.

395
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:56,569
Why do I, a prince, have to ride
such a filthy old taxi like a human?

396
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,904
Hey, silver hair!

397
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,006
If you have nothing to do,

398
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,074
how about you take care
of your customer?

399
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,013
Well, I say to take care
of your customer,

400
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,881
but why are you washing
my hair of all things?

401
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,117
So, boss, are you here
on business?

402
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,318
I'm not your boss!

403
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,953
What the hell
is wrong with you?

404
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,323
It's just that, I wanted to see
a panda all of a sudden.

405
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,192
I've got shampoo
in my eyes!

406
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,895
‐You're doing that on purpose, aren't you?!
‐I see.

407
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,397
You've come to see
a panda, have you?

408
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,298
‐Ow, the shampoo!
‐But don't be fooled by them.

409
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,168
‐Stop it! There's shampoo in my eyes!
‐It's said that they eat only bamboo...

410
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,369
‐...and nothing else.
‐Shampoo!

411
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,905
But we don't know what they're really
eating behind closed doors.

412
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,108
They may even be gorging
on overpriced hotspots.

413
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,316
Idiot, are you trying
to get yourself killed?!

414
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,651
What were you thinking?

415
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:49,055
Hey, you're that guy
from the job interview.

416
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,724
Old man, this is an emergency!

417
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,292
Please give us a ride!

418
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,994
Oh, I can't breathe!

419
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,997
Sachiko, Sachiko my wife,
she's suddenly gone into labor!

420
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:01,767
Aaah! My best feature has been
pulled right off, damn it!

421
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,568
Oh, man!

422
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:05,071
The car stopped so suddenly
that it came right off.

423
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,473
What are you going to do
about this?

424
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,142
Without that, I'm no different
from a regular human!

425
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,377
I'm like an assistant manager!

426
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,611
Don't worry about it.

427
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,780
You look like a manager
at the very least.

428
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,749
That's not my point, you idiot!

429
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,820
Look, if it comes off this easily,
it means you didn't really need it.

430
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,621
Stop! Quit it, you two!

431
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,257
There's a woman here who's about
to give birth at any moment!

432
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,860
Hey Gin, is there a
maternity clinic around here?

433
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,196
Uh, nope.
You'd have to turn back.

434
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,498
Well, then we will just
have to go back.

435
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,433
Are you kidding me?!

436
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,534
I lost my best feature

437
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,570
and now you're telling me
that we're going back?

438
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,437
Give me a break!

439
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,940
I'm seeing the damn pandas
no matter what happens!

440
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,409
Hurry up and get
this car moving!

441
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,878
But Your Highness, can't you
direct a tiny fraction

442
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,481
of your love for pandas
towards human beings?

443
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:51,750
Understand, a human baby
can be really cute too, you know.

444
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,918
Look here!

445
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,953
I couldn't care less!

446
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:57,323
You lot of conceited, inferior monkeys
don't deserve any love!

447
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:01,594
I don't give a monkeys left nut what
happens to a human baby or two!

448
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,795
Who do you think I am?!

449
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,663
I'll have you know that I'm...

450
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,866
Who the hell are you?

451
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,235
You're just some assistant
manager, aren't you?

452
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,070
Cut it out, Gin.

453
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,540
What do you think you're going to do
to the Prince back there?

454
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,810
I understand your point,
Prince Hata.

455
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,446
You really want to see
a panda, right?

456
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,084
And I just remembered that there's
actually a panda really close by.

457
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,087
What? Really?

458
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,021
Where?

459
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,524
Just look at your face in
the mirror tomorrow morning!

460
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,338
Hey, you two hoodlums!

461
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,740
A seat just opened up.

462
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,574
You need a ride?

463
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:51,710
Old man, I seriously
owe you one!

464
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,181
Hasegawa, you know what?

465
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,349
I think that you look
a lot better...

466
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,519
with your sunglasses on,
I have to say.

467
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,721
I do, don't I?

468
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,360
<i>‐Come on, let's go.</i>
‐Hey, old man!

469
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,696
I haven't seen you
around here in a while.

470
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,298
So, why did you come back?

471
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,269
Well... that is because...

472
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,838
I was fired from my job again,
so I'm back.

473
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,409
Why were you fired
from your job again?

474
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,411
Oh well, that's...

475
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,781
because I decided
to be true to myself.

476
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,051
But the thing is,
I'm not upset about it at all.

477
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,687
I've decided to live my life
doing what I think is right

478
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,655
instead of trying
to make everyone happy.

479
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,025
Good for you, but that doesn't change
the fact that you're a corny,

480
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,228
single, middle‐aged man,
you jobless loser.

481
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,030
Let's go, Sadaharu.

482
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,834
See ya, delusional old
reality ignoring knucklehead.

483
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,936
Or dork for short.

484
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,478
That girl is one tough cookie.

485
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,512
<i>Takasugi, what are you doing here?</i>

486
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,815
<i>I heard there was a festival.</i>

487
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,751
<i>So I just had to come here</i>
<i>and check it out.</i>

488
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,220
Don't tell me.
You dumb bastard.

489
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:49,555
<i>The next episode...</i>

490
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,424
<i>"Sons Only Take After Their Father's</i>
<i>Negative Attributes."</i>
