1
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:07,975
Heh.
There is no way, man!

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,511
I would rather die than go
against my principles!

3
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:20,954
These Aliens just ain't shit!

4
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,490
<i>Only one can survive,</i>
<i>the aliens?</i>

5
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:24,558
<i>Or the gangsters?</i>

6
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,393
<i>Aliens vs. Gangsters!</i>

7
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,095
Hey, brother.

8
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,197
A man's back shows
everything about him.

9
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,220
<i>Oh, man!</i>

10
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,522
Just when we were about to
get off work!

11
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,491
Yeah, but I heard they found
something stuck

12
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,493
on the ship's chassis while
it was in flight.

13
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,629
Yeah, well there had better
not be alien

14
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,131
or something stuck to
the damn thing...

15
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,266
Hey, that reminds me!

16
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,935
Did you see
"Aliens vs. Gangsters"?

17
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,703
Man, it was really awesome!

18
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,073
I haven't seen anything in the
series since "Aliens 2."

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,675
It can't possibly be that good.

20
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,110
No man, you've got to see it.

21
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,578
This one is awesome!

22
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,513
There's this massive army
of aliens, right,

23
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,814
and they fight
a massive army

24
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,249
of Brother Joe
and his gangsters...

25
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,285
and no matter which side wins,
it spells the end of Edo City!

26
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:33,320
Why is that,

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,489
why's Edo City going to be
destroyed because of Brother Joe?

28
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,690
Seriously, man!

29
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,226
Brother Joe was even
scarier than the aliens!

30
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,494
Heh, is that so?

31
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,296
Then let's hope it's not Brother Joe
that's attached to the ship.

32
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,939
It's for real!

33
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,174
Shut up!

34
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,575
Keep your voices down!

35
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,679
I've got the absolute
worst hangover...

36
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,514
and my head is killing me!

37
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:04,184
Why do I have to come all the way
to Earth just to exterminate Aliens?

38
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,218
Seriously...

39
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,191
However...
I didn't come here just to work...

40
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,927
Are you guys mechanics?

41
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,729
There's a good chance
that the parasite

42
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,898
that was in this alien escaped
to Edo City...

43
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,933
So Edo City's in big trouble.

44
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,703
Can you call the police for me?

45
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,474
Just tell them that it's from
Umibozu the Exterminator.

46
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,318
Hello? Odd Jobs.
How can I help you?

47
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,719
<i>Hello, Odd Jobs!</i>

48
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,288
<i>It's me, it's me.</i>

49
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:42,689
Who are you?

50
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,257
<i>I told you, it's me!</i>

51
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,426
<i>And I'm in seriously</i>
<i>big trouble.</i>

52
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:47,994
Is that you, Gin?

53
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,696
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>It's Gin, I'm Gin.</i>

54
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,766
<i>I just got into an accident</i>
<i>and hit a pregnant woman.</i>

55
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:53,967
<i>I'm in deep trouble.</i>

56
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,969
Finish her off and
run away then.

57
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:56,736
<i>What?</i>

58
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,804
<i>How could you say that?</i>

59
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,239
<i>That's an awful idea!</i>

60
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,540
<i>Anyway, I need money.</i>

61
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,876
<i>If you don't hurry,</i>
<i>I'm going to be arrested!</i>

62
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:04,811
Seriously?

63
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,446
<i>I need you to wire</i>
<i>ten thousand bucks</i>

64
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,848
<i>to this bank account now...</i>

65
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,491
I wiped my butt too hard...

66
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,527
We've got to stop buying
cheap toilet paper...

67
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,129
Hey, there.

68
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,030
Did somebody just leave
from here?

69
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,133
Yeah.
Kagura just left.

70
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,336
She went rushing out in a total panic
after taking a phone call.

71
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,404
What's that about?

72
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,039
Must've been a call
from her home.

73
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,308
Maybe they want her to return
to her home planet.

74
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,010
Well, that would be great.

75
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,546
It would surely be a lot
quieter around here.

76
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,047
More importantly...

77
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,183
Hey, Gin, you gotta check this out.

78
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,085
The "It's me, it's me" scam?

79
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,988
It's a new brand scam
where the con artist says,

80
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,389
"It's me, it's me," on the phone...

81
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,757
without saying their name.

82
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,626
And then they let you assume
it's someone that you know,

83
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,827
and then they say
they're in trouble,

84
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,095
and need you to wire
money to them.

85
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,799
I wouldn't send money to anyone
even if they were in trouble!

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,168
Remember this, Shinpachi.

87
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,104
The only person who'd fall
for that would be a stupid girl

88
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,172
with superhuman strength.

89
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,247
UMIBOZU?
What is that?

90
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,416
Are you saying you
don't know, Okita?

91
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,518
I thought everybody knew.

92
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,720
Hey, move it and
let me see that.

93
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:21,721
Hey, don't push.

94
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,589
Phew!

95
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,658
Somebody smells!
Wash your armpits man!

96
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,961
Long story short, he's an alien
buster from another planet...

97
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,964
Umibozu the Exterminator
who hunts and eradicates

98
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,066
the most dangerous aliens
in the galaxy...

99
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,102
He's celebrated as the
strongest of all alien busters.

100
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,072
He has influence over authorities
all throughout the universe

101
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,807
despite being a mere individual...

102
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,109
<i>He's a man who has</i>
<i>traveled the stars</i>

103
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,045
<i>and battled countless</i>
<i>alien monsters...</i>

104
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,847
<i>He's known as</i>
<i>"Umibozu the Exterminator,"</i>

105
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,282
<i>and he's a living legend.</i>

106
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,617
Ohh...

107
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,986
So what's a legend
doing here in Edo City?

108
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,089
Well, it seems an alien
escaped to Edo City.

109
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,758
We do appreciate you
coming here to warn us...

110
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,193
But we'll take it from here,

111
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,962
and rest assured we'll take it down...

112
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:06,266
Still, I never thought I would meet
the famous Umibozu in person.

113
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,301
I am incredibly honored to make
your acquaintance.

114
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,238
Did you come to Earth to
pick out some aliens?

115
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,907
Why do you make it sound like
I'm going shopping?

116
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,209
I'm here on a private business.

117
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,412
I'm pursuing someone much more
troublesome than any alien.

118
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,014
Oh wow!

119
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,650
Someone who troubles
even the famous Umibozu?

120
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,218
It's a chick, I take it!

121
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,722
She's indeed female, no question.

122
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,177
Excuse me, Miss,
but what are you doing?!

123
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,146
Gin told me on the phone!

124
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,881
He'll be thrown behind bars
if I don't send him

125
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,783
"ten thousand ducks"
to his bank account!

126
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,251
Ten thousand ducks?

127
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,586
Wait, Miss, wait, Miss...

128
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,321
Don't you mean
"ten thousand bucks"?

129
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,722
And what is that you're spilling?

130
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,691
It's rice for luring the ducks!

131
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,360
Hey! Well, I'm afraid ducks
don't eat rice!

132
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,596
Don't bother me, four eyes!

133
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,832
We're sorry about
the commotion, Sir.

134
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,501
Now, how can I help you?

135
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,336
Excuse me, Sir?

136
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,172
What's that?
Umibozu the Exterminator?

137
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,308
What's such a big shot
doing here?

138
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,477
<i>Hijikata, is something wrong?</i>

139
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,980
No, It's nothing at all,
nothing, Chief.

140
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,648
<i>We have to act quickly</i>

141
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,150
<i>or we're going to have</i>
<i>a major problem!</i>

142
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,785
<i>A parasitic alien...</i>

143
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,286
<i>has entered Edo City.</i>

144
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,488
Alien?

145
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,226
These aliens just ain't shit!!

146
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,462
This is a land of samurai!

147
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,731
<i>Hey, Hijikata, Harada,</i>
<i>what's going on there?</i>

148
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,966
Brother Joe,
we shall avenge you!!

149
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,468
<i>Brother Joe?</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

150
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,136
<i>Did something happen</i>
<i>to a man named Joe?</i>

151
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,105
Brother Joe, we love you!!

152
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,140
Look, I have no idea
what you're saying,

153
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,742
but listen to me very carefully!

154
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,778
The parasitic alien will take over
any organism as host,

155
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,914
from humans to dogs and cats!

156
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,349
Its intelligence is very low,

157
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,017
but it will do anything it
can to get food

158
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:04,918
<i>through using its host!</i>

159
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,387
<i>The quickest way to tell if someone's</i>
<i>been taken over by the alien...</i>

160
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,955
<i>is to look for a panda...</i>

161
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,658
<i>The parasite's host will have</i>
<i>dark circles around their eyes,</i>

162
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,659
<i>just like a panda...</i>

163
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,094
<i>Understand, men?</i>

164
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,128
<i>Look for a panda!</i>

165
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,230
<i>Not like, a real panda</i>
<i>who eats bamboo</i>

166
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,465
<i>and</i> <i>lays</i> <i>around</i>
<i>all</i> <i>day</i> <i>in</i> <i>a</i> <i>zoo!</i>

167
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,566
<i>But looks like a panda!</i>

168
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,336
<i>We must stop it before it harms</i>
<i>any civilians, so look for a panda!</i>

169
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,238
<i>Maya Sizitzy here,</i>

170
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,906
I'm at the Edo City Bank,

171
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,875
where a robber has
barricaded himself inside.

172
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,577
<i>We can see the robber's face!</i>

173
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,278
<i>What are those dark circles</i>
<i>around his eyes?</i>

174
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,346
<i>Lack of sleep?</i>

175
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,048
It's a panda.

176
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,483
<i>Testing, testing!</i>

177
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,517
<i>Listen up!</i>

178
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,388
<i>This is a message for the robber,</i>
<i>you are surrounded!</i>

179
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:42,756
<i>So come out peacefully!</i>

180
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,324
We're too late.

181
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:45,392
What?

182
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,761
You mean that Kagura did this?
Kagura is responsible?

183
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,195
So it would seem.

184
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,331
She was tricked by the
"It's me, it's me" swindle,

185
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,932
and she tried to wire money,

186
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,834
but, of course,
she doesn't have any...

187
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,736
And that's what led
to this violent act.

188
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,804
Oh no...

189
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:58,872
What should we do?

190
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,373
What, what can we do?

191
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,275
Hey, Gin?
Oh!

192
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,610
<i>‐Listen up, robber...</i>
‐No!

193
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,979
Hey, what're you people doing?

194
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,982
I don't really think I can
beat her in a fight...

195
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,484
but if I don't try to stop her,
who will?

196
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,753
If her family were here...

197
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,789
they'd probably do the same.

198
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,190
Gi‐Gintoki!

199
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,324
I'm going with you!

200
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,793
It's too dangerous!

201
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,394
Kagura!

202
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,466
‐Never mind, you're good.
‐Never mind, you're good.

203
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,570
It's a monster!

204
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,272
Well, now...

205
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:35,275
I'm glad that it seems our Kagura
isn't the robber after all.

206
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,377
Yeah, you're right, Gin.

207
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,746
But wasn't something
attacking her in there?

208
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,181
That must've been, you know...

209
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,549
her father, of course!

210
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,417
That call must've been
from her father,

211
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,853
and so they were probably
just meeting here.

212
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,223
Oh, of course, so that was
just her father hugging her.

213
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,926
We shouldn't disturb a father
and daughter's reunion.

214
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,761
Wait, Gin, you're so mean!

215
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,196
Why won't you rescue me?

216
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,532
What are you doing?
Let go!

217
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,967
And what's that stuff all
over you?!

218
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,635
Is that your father's guts
or something?

219
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,505
I was only trying to catch
ten thousand ducks for you, Gin!

220
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,407
What happened to the
predator woman?

221
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,675
Did you settle everything?

222
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:09,976
What predator woman?

223
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,112
What kind of scam did you
fall for, Kagura?

224
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,713
What the hell is that thing?

225
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,548
Isn't that really your father?

226
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,050
That's not my dad!!

227
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,686
It just appeared and started
spewing all over the place.

228
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,554
It's still spewing all over the place!

229
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,794
Let go!
Let go of me!!

230
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,195
Bad Kagura!
Let go of us!

231
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,563
No way!

232
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,031
I'm taking both of you with me!

233
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,036
Oh, I found you.

234
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:02,962
Hey...

235
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,063
that umbrella...

236
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,366
I've been looking
for you, Kagura.

237
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:14,974
Papa?

238
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:15,942
Pa...

239
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,243
‐Papa?!
‐Papa?!

240
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,286
Heh.
There is no way, man!

241
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,422
I would rather die than go
against my principles!

242
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,090
I was so moved.

243
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,292
‐Brother Joe is the best!
‐Brother Joe is the best!

244
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,927
Yes, it made us cry.

245
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:34,661
It was awesome.

246
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,996
‐These Aliens just ain't shit!
‐These Aliens just ain't shit!

247
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:42,535
These Aliens just ain't shit!

248
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,270
<i>Only one can survive...</i>

249
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,072
<i>the aliens Or the gangsters?</i>

250
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,308
<i>Aliens vs. Gangsters!</i>

251
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,776
Hey, brother.

252
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,844
A man's back shows
everything about him..

253
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:00,920
<i>Testing, testing.</i>

254
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,589
<i>This is a message</i>
<i>for the alien.</i>

255
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,324
<i>You are completely surrounded,</i>

256
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,526
<i>so just give up your</i>
<i>pointless resistance</i>

257
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,027
<i>and come out peacefully, alien.</i>

258
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,563
<i>Your mother from your</i>
<i>home planet is crying!</i>

259
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,299
<i>She</i> <i>said</i> <i>she</i> <i>didn't</i> <i>raise</i> <i>you</i>
<i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>this</i> <i>kind</i> <i>of</i> <i>alien.</i>

260
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,534
What kind of alien?

261
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,070
<i>It doesn't matter if you're</i>
<i>alien or human,</i>

262
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,205
<i>anyone who makes</i>
<i>his mother cry is a loser.</i>

263
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,139
Am I right, mother?

264
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,975
Say something to
your alien son.

265
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,309
What?
She's here?

266
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,510
Its mother is here?

267
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,450
My baby, Mommy can't look
after you anymore...

268
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,053
My baby, ever since
that day three years ago,

269
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,722
you've been dead to me.

270
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,024
Whoa!...

271
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:39,759
Chief!

272
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,495
These aliens just ain't shit!

273
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,963
They just ain't shit!

274
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,332
Hey!
This isn't an alien, though.

275
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,900
Hey, Chief, are you okay?

276
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,471
Someone's coming out now.

277
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:52,672
Ready!

278
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,248
Just come with me,
sweetheart!

279
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,249
And maybe...

280
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,084
I'll treat you to a
chocolate sundae!

281
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,686
No.
Let me go!

282
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,321
And don't walk so close to me!

283
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,389
What's the matter?

284
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,990
Are you embarrassed
to be with your papa?

285
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,925
What is it?
What part of me is embarrassing?

286
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,527
Tell me what it is,
and papa will fix it!

287
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,230
I'm pretty sure that it's
too late to fix it.

288
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,166
Kagura, there's absolutely
nothing that a man can't fix!

289
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,402
I can make amends
for any mistake!

290
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,836
It's impossible!

291
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,339
Once your follicle dies,
your hair will never grow back!

292
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,841
Excuse me, I'd like a
chocolate sundae, too.

293
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,677
No, wait a minute.

294
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,146
Maybe I'll have a fruit sundae,
after all.

295
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,614
Oh, what should I have?

296
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,215
What's happening?

297
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,352
<i>At the sound of the gong,</i>
<i>the time will be...</i>

298
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:40,853
The Umibozu?!

299
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,855
Umibozu the Exterminator...

300
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,557
is Kagura's father?!

301
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,859
The Umibozu?

302
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,361
The alien exterminator?

303
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,963
Did he accidentally exterminate
everything growing on his head?

304
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,132
Hey, mophead,
are you calling me a baldy?

305
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,501
I'll have you know that I'm just
follically challenged!

306
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,138
Umibozu is the fiercest
Alien Buster ever.

307
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,773
His name is known
throughout galaxy.

308
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,442
The wandering Umibozu.

309
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,111
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I think I've heard of him.

310
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,345
The hairless sleeper.

311
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,981
Oh, It's the "fearless sweeper,"
you idiot,

312
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,283
and that's quite enough
from you!

313
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,451
Who is this jerk, huh?

314
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,052
He makes your papa mad.

315
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,387
So can I kill him now?

316
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,489
Oh, calm down, bald eagle.

317
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:17,857
Who's a Bald eagle?

318
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,026
Wait, like the symbol of America?

319
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,160
That's not bad!

320
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,029
Bald eagle, let me introduce you.

321
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,098
This hopeless four eyes
is Shinpachi.

322
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,566
What do you mean, hopeless?

323
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:29,068
And this guy with the
stupid mophead is Gin.

324
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,637
Hey, Kagura,
what's with the stupid?

325
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,407
So these are the guys that
I'm looking after here on Earth...

326
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:35,975
Say hi to each other.

327
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,679
Are you sure these two weren't
planning something illegal?

328
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,848
The streets are overflowing
with people

329
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,350
who want to misuse
the strength of the Yato clan.

330
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,718
What's that?

331
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,854
What do you mean by
"misuse" the power?

332
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,889
Do you mean like rubbing
your crystal head

333
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,457
so I can see into the future?

334
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,793
A father who abandoned his
daughter on planet Earth

335
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,495
has no right to talk like that.

336
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:59,132
I have been worried sick and
looking all over for her.

337
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,068
I took my eyes off her for a
second and she disappeared.

338
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,003
Girls at this age are very difficult.

339
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,572
I mean, they're as fragile
as a glass sculpture.

340
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,274
You're one to talk?

341
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,643
Well you're the one with a crystal
ball sitting on top of your neck!

342
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,410
Idiot!

343
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,846
You think you can talk big because
of your hair and all.

344
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,482
But, when you pass thirty,
it'll happen so quickly.

345
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,183
Before you know it,

346
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,117
‐the follicle goddess
‐Come on, stop that,

347
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,852
‐will abandon you too!
‐stop that you two!

348
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,888
The point is, I can't leave
my daughter here on Earth

349
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:22,755
with people like you.

350
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,489
So...

351
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,391
I'm taking Kagura
back home with me!

352
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,226
You don't get to decide that!

353
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,631
Kagura, dear, there's no
excuse for domestic violence!

354
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,332
Papa, you ignored
your family

355
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,134
and did whatever you
wanted all this time.

356
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,136
I don't want you meddling
in my life now...

357
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,339
Papa, I don't interfere in your life,
so don't interfere in mine!

358
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,409
I came to Earth on my own,
and I'll go back home on my own.

359
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:46,179
Kagura, dear...

360
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,748
A family is like just like
a bird's nest.

361
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,684
A bird can't keep on flying
around forever.

362
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:55,988
If there's no nest to go home to,
it'll eventually fall to the ground.

363
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,890
Papa, you're a migratory bird.

364
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,625
You don't need a nest,

365
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,727
and I'm exactly the same way.

366
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,230
I don't need a nest;
a wooden perch is enough.

367
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,566
Then what's so special about
this wooden perch?

368
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,768
Is there something that
you can only here?

369
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,505
Papa, tell me what I would gain
by going back home.

370
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,641
I would rather find a perch
and fly wherever I like.

371
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,443
Little girl!

372
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,345
Don't talk like you know it all.

373
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,146
Baldy...

374
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,548
You still think that
I'm a little girl, huh?

375
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:25,852
Okay?

376
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,353
What's going on here?

377
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,521
Hey, they're going to...

378
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,324
Kagura!

379
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,084
All right, carry it carefully outside.

380
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,787
Hijikata, what're we going to use
such a disgusting corpse for?

381
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,557
The Immigration officers said
to bring it to them.

382
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:08,494
Apparently, there's some VIP
who wants it, they said...

383
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,130
You'd think he could find
something better to collect...

384
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,000
Is this the kind of
monster that Umibozu

385
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,868
the Exterminator
always fights?

386
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,337
Makes me wonder which one
is the real monster.

387
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,007
And to think that he's that
rambo girl's father!

388
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:24,110
Not exactly the family type, is he.

389
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,913
There are two kinds of
men in the universe...

390
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,115
One is the protective type,

391
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:32,285
who seeks to protect his home
and his family at all costs...

392
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,220
The other is the hunter type

393
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,856
who leaves that home and
goes out in search of prey...

394
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,559
<i>I saw hunter in</i>
<i>that man's eyes,</i>

395
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,862
<i>it was the eyes of a beast.</i>

396
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,531
<i>He's definitely not the type</i>
<i>that can stay at home...</i>

397
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,367
<i>And I'm afraid that girl must</i>
<i>have had a very lonely life</i>

398
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,468
<i>when she was back home...</i>

399
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:53,572
What's that?!

400
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:54,740
What are they?

401
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,075
Are they humans?!

402
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,614
Do you think I'd really allow
my unmarried daughter

403
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,417
to live under the same roof
as another guy or two?

404
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,419
Don't you understand, Kagura,

405
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,688
that's how you get a
shotgun marriage!

406
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,124
I'm not that kind of girl, Papa!

407
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,292
And anyway,

408
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,228
isn't that why you married mama
in the first place?

409
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,263
That chatterbox!

410
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,998
I can't believe she told you that!

411
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,867
You've got no right to tell me
what to do, Papa!

412
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,202
I do!

413
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,972
And I won't let you make
the same mistake I did!

414
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:54,900
Leave me alone already!

415
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,870
That's all you've ever done
my whole life, anyway!

416
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,206
So I'll decide for myself
where and how

417
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,108
I'll live, and for now it's here!

418
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,779
Seems like you really like this
wooden perch you've found...

419
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,618
Then that's all the more reason
why you should leave it.

420
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,354
Have you forgotten,
the blood of the beast that runs

421
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,756
through our veins?

422
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,959
The Yato instinct that makes us
roam in search of prey?

423
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,895
We are beasts that can only
live on the battlefield...

424
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,165
Look what happens when you put
that beast in a peaceful place...

425
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,901
<i>You will forget who you are...</i>

426
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,337
<i>and destroy everything</i>
<i>around you.</i>

427
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,538
<i>Stay here, and you'll...</i>

428
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,508
<i>end up snapping this wooden</i>
<i>perch in half yourself...</i>

429
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,177
If you love this place, then leave it.

430
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,579
If you don't want to go home,
then come with me...

431
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,582
This isn't the place
for you, Kagura.

432
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,552
You and I cannot fly
freely in this sky.

433
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:48,254
No way...

434
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,221
I don't want to live a life

435
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,390
where I just give up
and refuse to change...

436
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,759
I'm going to grow
and change here,

437
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,062
I know that if I stay here,
I can change...

438
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,597
I'll stay with Gin and the others.

439
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,700
What, Gin?

440
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,168
That mophead guy?

441
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,870
What can a bum like
him do for you?

442
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:06,872
You leave me no choice...

443
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,909
Then I'm going to take you
home with me by force.

444
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:19,919
Oh, Gin!

445
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:22,755
Oh, Mommy!

446
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:23,789
Goodness!

447
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,458
What is it with you people?!

448
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:27,093
But Gin...

449
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,294
I...

450
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:31,564
Oh...

451
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,165
What do you think
you're doing?

452
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,035
Don't be sticking your nose
in a family matter.

453
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,540
That was some wild fight,
wasn't it?

454
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,009
Like father like daughter.

455
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,112
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree...

456
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,249
Go home...

457
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,553
The Earth seems way too
small for you, Kagura...

458
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,989
This is a good opportunity.

459
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,891
Go home with your father...

460
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,727
Let's make this a good‐bye.

461
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,464
Huh?
But why?

462
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,366
Why are you saying that to me?

463
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,269
I'm never going back home,
I'm staying...

464
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:13,472
Staying here forever
with you and the others...

465
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,407
Oh, wait, don't go!

466
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,509
Stop it!

467
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,044
Think about it, Kagura...

468
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,514
This isn't where you belong,
and you know it.

469
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,623
Why, Gin...?

470
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,191
Why, Gin...?

471
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:34,793
But why...?

472
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,726
<i>You fired her?!</i>

473
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:14,960
<i>You fired Kagura?</i>

474
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,329
<i>Wait, does that mean she's going</i>
<i>home with her father?!</i>

475
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:21,300
<i>Gin, have you ever thought about</i>
<i>Kagura's feelings on this?</i>

476
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,801
<i>The next episode...</i>
