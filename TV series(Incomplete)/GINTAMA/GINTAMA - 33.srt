1
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,291
<i>With</i> <i>Gin</i> <i>losing</i> <i>his</i> <i>memory</i>
<i>in</i> <i>an</i> <i>accident,</i>

2
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,661
<i>and Sakamoto's spaceship</i>
<i>destroying the Odd Jobs building,</i>

3
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,031
<i>we were, literally speaking</i>
<i>all broken up.</i>

4
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,570
Shinpachi, you better have
brought my wooden sword!

5
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,871
Here!

6
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:45,973
Hey, Foreman.

7
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,475
I'm sorry, but after today I quit!

8
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,610
‐G‐Gin's back!
‐G‐Gin's back!

9
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,250
<i>And that's how Gin's memory</i>
<i>was restored.</i>

10
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,554
<i>The only problem left is</i>
<i>somehow restoring Gin's place.</i>

11
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,139
Hey, Gintoki...

12
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,743
So we're trying to repair
the Odd Jobs HQ, right?

13
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,381
But all I hear are fingers
being smashed

14
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,849
and the house being destroyed.

15
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,886
Every act of creation is first an
act of destruction, Shinpachi.

16
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:36,056
Yeah, but when are we gonna
start creating, though?

17
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,091
I knew it, this is hopeless.

18
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,494
You should never let
amateurs do carpentry.

19
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,728
You idiot!

20
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,397
Do you know how many
"professionals" out there

21
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,098
just take your money
to build what

22
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,467
end up as defective houses
these days?

23
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,170
Still better than defective people
trying to build a house, idiot.

24
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,571
What else are we going to do?

25
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,874
It's not like we have the money
to hire a carpenter.

26
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,242
Or what do you want, Shinpachi?

27
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,244
Do you want to get us kicked
out by that old hag?

28
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,579
Besides, you're supposed to be
a "Jack of All Trades,"

29
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,782
you should be able to fix
something like this easily.

30
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,317
Hey Gin!

31
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,319
Desperate times,
desperate measures!

32
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,289
No, wait, no, no, no!
Stop!

33
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,757
Whoa!

34
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,094
Wow! Wow!
Whoa!

35
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,466
‐Yeow, stop it now!!
‐No!

36
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,569
I can't.
It's rebelling against me!

37
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,439
You idiot!

38
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,107
Stop that wild horse you're riding!

39
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,775
Kagura, we're all gonna die!

40
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,811
Seriously, we're gonna die!

41
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:31,845
‐The switch, turn it off!
‐I can't!

42
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,513
I've never dealt with a
rebellious kid before!

43
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,516
If you don't know how to use it,
then don't even try to use it, idiot!

44
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,323
Take this!

45
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,659
‐Whoa!
‐Whoa!

46
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,227
Whoa!

47
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,362
Damn it!

48
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,197
What do you mean, damn it?

49
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,199
Why are you trying to destroy me?

50
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,400
Don't worry, Shinpachi.

51
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,734
People destroy their old selves

52
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,571
so they can embark on a journey
to find their newselves.

53
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,538
You moron!

54
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,541
You were about to send me off
to another dimension!

55
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,881
Kagura, don't you move!
I got it, Gin!

56
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,124
Okay, now it's stopped.

57
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,658
I declare case closed.

58
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,127
What do you mean,
"case closed"?

59
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,262
This place looks worse than
it did before!

60
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,097
Ding dong!

61
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,866
Ding dong!

62
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,101
Excuse me,
but I have a delivery for you.

63
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,377
<i>Dear Kintoki.</i>

64
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,946
<i>I know we haven't kept</i>
<i>in touch for a while,</i>

65
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,414
<i>but how are you doing?</i>

66
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,617
<i>I'm fine as usual,</i>

67
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,553
<i>flying all over the universe</i>
<i>from here to there.</i>

68
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,989
<i>Space is truly a great place.</i>

69
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,260
<i>The other day I had an opportunity</i>
<i>to stop by Earth,</i>

70
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,095
<i>so I decided to visit you.</i>

71
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,197
<i>But sadly, it seems like</i>
<i>we missed each other.</i>

72
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,332
<i>I'm writing you now because...</i>

73
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,968
<i>there was something important</i>
<i>I wanted to tell you.</i>

74
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,304
<i>Kintoki. You once said...</i>

75
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,106
<i>Hey, Ibaragi.</i>

76
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,041
<i>I</i> <i>heard</i> <i>you</i> <i>went</i> <i>to</i> <i>a</i>
<i>hostess</i> <i>bar</i> <i>again.</i>

77
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,809
<i>Next time, take me with you.</i>

78
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,244
<i>Or something like that.</i>

79
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,214
<i>But his name isn't Ibaragi,</i>
<i>it's really Ibaraki!</i>

80
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,516
<i>I wondered whether</i>
<i>I should bring this up</i>

81
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,051
<i>after all these years.</i>

82
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,787
<i>But</i> <i>it's</i> <i>just</i> <i>plain</i> <i>rude</i> <i>to</i> <i>get</i>
<i>someone's</i> <i>name</i> <i>wrong.</i>

83
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,055
<i>That's all.</i>

84
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,890
<i>Take care of yourself, Kintoki.</i>

85
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,392
<i>From Tatsuma Sakamoto.</i>

86
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,928
<i>P.S.</i>
<i>Sorry for destroying your house.</i>

87
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,229
<i>P.P.S.</i>

88
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:34,334
<i>Isn't it funny how you feel like using</i>
<i>"P. S." every time you write a letter? LOL</i>

89
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,268
My ass!

90
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,136
This is BS!!

91
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,905
The content of the body and
the ps are totally backwards!

92
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,675
He destroys my house and all
I get is a "P. S." apology?

93
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,710
And he got my name
wrong again, too!

94
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,313
Even if P. S. means that
I wish for world peace,

95
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,315
it's simply unforgivable, man!

96
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,617
Birds of a feather flock together.

97
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,185
We don't flock together at all!

98
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,386
I really hope he dies.

99
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,523
I hope he suffers a slow
and painful death.

100
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,658
Come on, just take it easy, Gin.

101
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,727
Never mind the letter
or what he said.

102
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,530
What Sakamoto really wanted
to send you is this, right?

103
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,900
But what is inside this box?

104
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,803
I bet he sent you a
spectacular apology gift.

105
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,340
Oh yeah, now that I think
about it, he's a rich kid...

106
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:16,776
<i>‐Money?</i>
<i>‐Money?</i>

107
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,211
What's this now?

108
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,614
All right, all right.

109
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:24,150
Why didn't he just mention this in the
first place, that little rascal...

110
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,052
‐I tell you...
‐We can finally fix up the house now...

111
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,887
That guy jokes around
much more than I do.

112
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,460
Hello.

113
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,628
Thank you for calling Express...

114
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,111
Oh, this must be a dream.

115
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,279
It's totally illogical.

116
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,446
This can't be happening.

117
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,115
There were two
little men in there.

118
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,317
Two little men squished
inside that big box.

119
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,853
No, no, those were dolls,
don't you think?

120
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:00,720
They're just dolls.

121
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,022
Let's take another look.

122
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,557
I'm telling you, it's a dream!

123
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,426
Come on, that's enough,
I gotta wake up.

124
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,560
Hello.

125
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,029
Thank you for calling Express...

126
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:10,997
Yup!

127
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,133
It's all...

128
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,301
definitely a dream.

129
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,203
We're being tormented by
hallucinations of tiny bald men.

130
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,638
All right, let's take a break.

131
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,640
Meet you later after we take a nap.

132
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,142
‐Okay.
‐Okay.

133
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,376
Hold on a second!

134
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,912
You buttheads!

135
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,448
Shut up and listen while we're talking,
you morons!

136
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,985
Yeah, listen, we're supposed to say,
"Thank you for calling the Express

137
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,687
Doorstep Delivery Carpenters!"

138
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,055
You idiots!

139
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,290
Delivery Carpenters,
did you say?

140
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,792
I've never heard of such a thing.

141
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,261
I have no idea what that is,
so go home.

142
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,063
How dare you talk
to us like that!

143
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,098
We traveled all the way
from a distant planet

144
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,333
just to fix your house!

145
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,867
Hold on just a second...

146
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,703
did Sakamoto send
you guys here?

147
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:50,737
That's right!

148
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:51,738
If we get a call,

149
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,307
we go build a house, even if
it's on a different galaxy!

150
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,475
Unkei!

151
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,309
And this is...

152
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,177
Kaikei!!

153
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,978
We're the Express Carpenters!

154
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,046
Next, please!

155
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,614
No.
This isn't an audition!

156
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,384
You buttheads, what can
you do looking like that?

157
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,287
I bet the two of you can only
make us a gingerbread house.

158
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,989
Oh, but then again, gingerbread
house, that's not so bad.

159
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,726
Don't be so shocked,
but listen up.

160
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,128
Do you know the mighty
Terminal building,

161
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,629
the symbol of Japan's might,

162
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,833
that made Edo an
international city?

163
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,568
That terminal, inside there,

164
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,536
you know that cupboard
for hanging spoons?

165
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,706
Well, it was us who made those!

166
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,876
It won't come crashing down when
the door is slammed closed, either!

167
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,478
That's so lame.

168
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,247
I once made a bookshelf out of
milk cartons, you know, man.

169
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,082
And it's environmentally friendly, too.

170
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,318
So what? You think something
environmentally friendly

171
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,686
like that is going to save the Earth?

172
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,721
It's not for the Earth, we just
don't have any money.

173
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,556
Yeah, we're on a
very tight budget!

174
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,792
What the hell are you guys
talking about?

175
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,728
You know what, it can't get any
worse than it is right now,

176
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,397
so let's have them do it.

177
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,500
Besides, it looks like Sakamoto
already paid them to fix our place.

178
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,738
Tell me, Do you know this quote?

179
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,408
It's something a carpenter
named Mokichi once said.

180
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,277
"Craftsmen who talk a lot
are never very good."

181
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,181
Remember, a truly good craftsman
never needs to talk about his work.

182
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,285
He lets his hands do the talking.

183
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,156
Which side do you guys belong to?

184
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,690
What is all that racket?
What's going on up there?

185
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,960
Is it them again?

186
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,536
That silver haired
punk is challenging us!

187
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:32,772
Well we'll show him who the best
carpenters in the universe are!

188
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,974
Who the hell are those guys?

189
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,546
‐Wow!
‐Wow!

190
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:41,815
Amazing.

191
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,417
They actually fixed
everything overnight!

192
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,763
Take a look around,
the interior's perfect.

193
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,165
The skills of the best carpenters
in the universe!

194
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,033
Awesome!

195
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,101
They really are
amazing carpenters!

196
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,903
Hey, Gin, isn't this terrific?

197
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,005
We can go back
into business now!

198
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,106
Mm...

199
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,908
Something's not right.

200
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,045
I don't remember Odd Jobs...

201
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,813
being this bleak before.

202
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,949
Well, it's not our fault
you can't afford furniture!

203
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,851
We haven't touched
the original structure.

204
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,619
No, no, no, no.

205
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,521
It's not the structure at all.

206
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,190
No, something's
definitely is missing.

207
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,191
It's, um...

208
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:25,959
Oh, I know!

209
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,963
No wonder the room looks
so plain and ordinary.

210
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,865
The chandelier is missing!

211
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,700
‐Chandelier?
‐Chandelier?

212
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,235
What "chandelier" do you mean?

213
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,971
A chandelier in a traditional
Japanese house would clash!

214
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,472
I don't know.

215
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,674
Are you sure we had
something like that?

216
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,142
I'm sure that we did.

217
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,245
You don't just look up
at the ceiling all the time.

218
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,080
You must've just
forgotten about it.

219
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,114
Now that you mention it...

220
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,716
I do remember
there was one.

221
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,852
Also, what happened to the stairs
connecting to the third floor?

222
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:53,953
The third floor?

223
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,121
We had a third floor?

224
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,122
I never knew that!

225
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,090
Yeah...

226
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,791
you guys may not know
about it.

227
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,460
But it used to be above the dresser.

228
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,829
The third floor was for
my comic collection.

229
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:03,997
Are you serious?

230
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,932
There's definitely something
wrong with my room.

231
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,000
It wasn't this small.

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,967
Don't mess with me.

233
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,737
The floor was enough
for 600 square feet!

234
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,505
‐600 square feet?
‐600 square feet?

235
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,973
600 square feet closet?

236
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,542
That's bigger than
the living room!

237
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,478
Kagura, come on, don't you think
you're exaggerating a little bit?

238
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,680
Okay, I'll compromisefor
400 square feet.

239
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,182
I've never heard such an
unreasonable compromise!

240
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,517
Also, the toilet.

241
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,619
I'm pretty sure it has
a washout installed.

242
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,721
Also the bathroom wall
was all glass.

243
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,623
It had an arousing atmosphere.

244
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,525
Oh, I remember something, too.

245
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,627
And there was a karaoke machine
in the living room.

246
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,695
Hang on there!

247
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,130
We never even touched
the living room!

248
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,598
That should be
the way it was.

249
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,667
Have you ever heard
this story?

250
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,204
Long ago...

251
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,308
<i>There were two carpenters who</i>
<i>competed to be the most popular.</i>

252
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,976
<i>One was a millionaire's son,</i>

253
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,744
<i>who was also good</i>
<i>at running business.</i>

254
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,845
<i>His name was Gohei.</i>

255
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,881
<i>The other was an odd</i>
<i>guy named Mokichi.</i>

256
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,250
<i>He didn't care much</i>
<i>about being paid at all.</i>

257
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:01,354
<i>Mokichi had no interest in worldly</i>
<i>success, but Gohei was different.</i>

258
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,891
<i>Every day, Gohei schemed</i>
<i>to get rid of Mokichi</i>

259
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,660
<i>so that he could be the most</i>
<i>popular carpenter in Edo City.</i>

260
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,164
<i>Before long, Mokichi's</i>
<i>reputation began to wane.</i>

261
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,099
<i>Gohei was behind this.</i>

262
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,234
<i>He</i> <i>pulled</i> <i>strings</i> <i>around</i>
<i>and</i> <i>made</i> <i>sure</i> <i>Mokichi</i>

263
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,003
<i>got the worst kind of cases.</i>

264
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,139
<i>Mokichi had all the impossible</i>
<i>and difficult jobs forced on him,</i>

265
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,243
<i>and eventually, Mokichi was</i>
<i>no longer able to find work.</i>

266
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,211
<i>Exactly as Gohei had planned.</i>

267
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,816
<i>Mokichi's popularity dwindled rapidly</i>
<i>and Gohei's day had come.</i>

268
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,784
<i>Or so it seemed...</i>

269
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,754
<i>But suddenly Mokichi's</i>
<i>troubles had dissolved.</i>

270
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,492
<i>Years later, Mokichi's popularity</i>
<i>surpassed that of Gohei's</i>

271
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,694
<i>and he was the top carpenter in Edo City.</i>

272
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,563
<i>You probably want to know why.</i>

273
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,331
<i>Gohei wanted to know, too.</i>

274
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,668
You bastard, what kind of
dirty trick did you pull?

275
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:52,171
Weren't you the one getting forced
to do all the impossible jobs?

276
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,207
Mokichi replied.

277
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,642
Yes, you are right.

278
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,310
And it was very difficult work,

279
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,712
but it taught me more tha
I'veever known about carpentry.

280
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,315
I sure am grateful
that it happened.

281
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,451
Mokichi is the bomb!

282
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,620
Mokichi probably
didn't even realize

283
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,188
he was being tricked by Gohei.

284
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,857
He loved carpentry so much

285
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,959
that he welcomed the
challenges presented!

286
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,095
Isn't that what it really means
to be a craftsman?

287
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,832
Damn it!

288
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,435
That punk has
sparked my soul!

289
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,169
Yeah, Bro!

290
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,438
No matter how you look at it,
they're playing us!

291
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,340
Like marionettes on a string!

292
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,076
I know, I know,
but I just can't stop it.

293
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,445
My craftmen's blood is all
fired up and boiling.

294
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,613
Me too, bro!

295
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,515
What is this feeling
that I'm feeling?

296
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,884
Was this how Mokichi
must have felt?

297
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,987
<i>‐Mokichi!</i>
<i>‐Mokichi!</i>

298
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:41,754
Well then?

299
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,256
Who's this Mokichi?

300
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:00,640
How's that?

301
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,674
You bastards!

302
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,975
You've got no complaints now!

303
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,912
Witness the work of the greatest
carpenters in the universe!

304
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,880
Wow!
That's amazing.

305
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,449
They even made a third floor, too.

306
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,317
But my room hasn't
changed at all!

307
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,885
What's the meaning of this?

308
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,488
Wow, you two are
really good carpenters.

309
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:16,889
All right, then!

310
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,424
Yeah.
We'll be going now.

311
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,594
Hey, what about my room, huh?
Well, there's still the exterior.

312
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,597
‐Exterior?
‐Exterior?

313
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,965
O‐Outside?

314
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:26,966
We already fixed the walls!

315
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,868
Yeah, you didn't say
anything about that before!

316
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,703
Hey, what about my room?

317
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,205
Don't you all ignore me!

318
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,540
No, but there's still something missing.

319
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,375
Something is missing...

320
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,977
The Odd Jobs was more...

321
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,514
More like this, I think.

322
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,751
Excuse me, that's far
beyond missing something!

323
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,185
That's a totally different building!

324
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,186
That's the Parthenon!

325
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,755
That's right.
Just like the "Pantihose".

326
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:49,989
You showed us that without
even knowing what the

327
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,624
‐Parthenon is?!
‐You have such bad taste!

328
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,960
It looked like this one!
This one!

329
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,495
That's the Castle in the Sky!

330
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:56,362
What is this?

331
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,997
You think we're genie
in a bottle?

332
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:58,998
That's impossible!

333
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,333
We're leaving!

334
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,034
All right, all right.

335
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,604
Okay, fine, just leave it as is.

336
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,239
Just make sure that it can fly.

337
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:09,041
Make it fly when you push
a button, you buttheads.

338
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,910
That's the biggest
problem so far!

339
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,879
In what world have you ever
seen a house that flies

340
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,713
when you push a button?

341
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,615
In the world of cartoons,
when you push a button,

342
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,983
everything works out somehow.

343
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:17,683
That's right.

344
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,318
All you do is just push a button.

345
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,020
I'm getting tired of this.

346
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,121
We're out of here.

347
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,090
Hey, did you ever hear
this story?

348
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,561
<i>Damn it!</i>

349
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,863
That young punk
is so annoying!

350
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,399
Plus, we already used up
all the money that Sakamoto

351
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,368
gave us a long time ago!

352
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,771
What a shock that Mokichi
had such a secret in his past!

353
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,908
Yeah, who can say no after
hearing that story, Bro!

354
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:42,809
Kaikei!

355
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,278
That must mean we have the same
craftsman's heart as Mokichi,

356
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,612
don't you think?

357
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,713
You think so, Bro?

358
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,715
We're exactly the same as him?

359
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,185
<i>‐Mokichi!</i>
<i>‐Mokichi!</i>

360
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,554
Who the hell is this Mokichi?

361
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:57,757
Hey, Bro...

362
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,192
it's already morning.

363
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,760
Just a little bit more.

364
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,661
Wait, Bro?

365
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,462
Let's take a little break.

366
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,766
I'll go and get us some coffee, okay?

367
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,635
You can't do good work by
pushing yourself too hard.

368
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,804
Speed isn't everything, after all.

369
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,239
Yeah, but bro!

370
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:16,909
I'm sure that Mokichi had a cup of
coffee once in a while too...

371
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,746
as he sat back and appreciated his
marvelous work being completed.

372
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,451
<i>While working, you reflect...</i>

373
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,887
<i>upon the joy that</i>
<i>your work gives you.</i>

374
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,489
<i>Isn't that what being a</i>
<i>craftsman is all about?</i>

375
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,792
Oh, man, Bro!

376
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,094
I just got goosebumps
hearing you say that!

377
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:35,828
Kaikei!

378
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,797
We have but one goal,
haven't we?

379
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,566
<i>‐Mokichi!</i>
<i>‐Mokichi!</i>

380
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,702
So...
Just who is this Mokichi?

381
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,171
Mokichi?

382
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,839
He doesn't exist at all.

383
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,841
I totally just made him up.

384
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,610
Are you serious, Gin?

385
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,379
Those two are so easy
to fool, Kagura.

386
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,213
Yeah but...

387
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,682
if they ever find out,
they'll be really mad at us.

388
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,851
I think it's best if we keep
it to ourselves.

389
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,753
Don't worry about it.

390
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,189
I mean, they're stupid enough
to buy that story.

391
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,391
I'm sure they'll
never figure it out.

392
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,229
You ass hole!

393
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,465
It was all a lie?!
Shit!

394
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,400
Hey, no, wait up!

395
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,936
What, Bro?
Are you serious?

396
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,572
You're saying Mokichi
never even existed?

397
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,341
That's right.
That's why we're leaving, Kaikei!

398
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:25,044
‐Our job is done here.
‐B‐But, But Bro!

399
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,147
Uh..

400
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:38,925
Hey, Gin...

401
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:57,944
Hah...

402
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,546
I'm never coming back to
this planet ever again!

403
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,783
But listen, Bro, is it okay
to just leave in the middle...

404
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,484
of what we were working on?

405
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,419
Who cares?

406
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,788
We worked hard for them and they
just played with our emotions.

407
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,723
They should be thankful
for what we do!

408
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,591
Those ungrateful bastards!

409
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,659
Oh, yeah?

410
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,361
You!

411
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,930
You've really got some
nerve showing your face

412
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,432
after everything you did.

413
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,534
Come on, don't say that.

414
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,703
There must be
some misunderstanding.

415
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:24,637
What?

416
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:27,273
Whether or not Mokichi existed
or not is not the point.

417
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,076
In fact, it's totally
completely irrelevant.

418
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,244
‐What do you mean?!
‐What are you talking about?

419
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,946
The real Mokichi...

420
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,649
lives inside the souls...

421
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,352
of craftsmen like you guys,
I can see in your eyes.

422
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,958
You guys are now starting
to look like a true Mokichi.

423
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,227
Y...You are...

424
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:53,030
Have you ever heard of this story?

425
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,504
I get it now!
I get it now!

426
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,770
Who knew there was such a mystery
hidden behind the story of Mokichi.

427
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,776
Mokichi, you're the best!

428
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,680
Who can say no after
hearing that story, Bro?

429
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,283
Kaikei!
I don't understand!

430
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,885
Did Mokichi really exist or not?

431
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,620
I don't understand any of this!

432
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:15,788
It doesn't matter, Bro!

433
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,556
Because it's all inside our souls.

434
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,226
It doesn't matter whether Mochiki
actually existed or not,

435
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,294
Mokichi lives inside our soul.

436
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,096
All right, Kaikei!
Let's do this.

437
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,698
Let's give it our all, buddy!

438
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,099
Let's show them that we are

439
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,069
the very best carpenters
in the entire universe, bro!

440
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,504
<i>No way!</i>
<i>The second best!</i>

441
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,206
<i>Because the number one title</i>
<i>goes to the one and only...</i>

442
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,908
<i>‐Mokichi!</i>
<i>‐Mokichi!</i>

443
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,611
So just who the hell is
this Mokichi, damn it!

444
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:50,189
Good morning
I'm Thigh Bennington.

445
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,024
Today, here in Kabukicho,

446
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,360
Edo City's business and
shopping district,

447
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,728
we will be visiting the home of

448
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,230
Gintoki Sakata who
runs Odd Jobs.

449
00:19:58,998 --> 00:19:59,799
Oh...

450
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,634
this must be his house...

451
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,204
Today's building,
the Sakata residence,

452
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,808
was recently renovated by
two Amanto architect brothers,

453
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,943
known as Unkei and Kaikei.

454
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,580
Their exterior is reminiscent
of the Greek Parthenon,

455
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:19,285
and it is combined with a gorgeous
palace section out of a fairy tale.

456
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,556
I will now guide you through
the Sakata residence.

457
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,858
Let's talk to the owner of
the house, Mr. Sakata.

458
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,727
Hello...? Hmm...
where's the doorbell?

459
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,595
Uh, let's see.

460
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,362
Is this it?

461
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,597
Just push the button...

462
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,041
I can feel a deep vibration,

463
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,510
as profound as the
exterior of the house.

464
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,829
What a wonderful house.

465
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,364
It can even fly!

466
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,610
Somebody go and get Mokichi.

467
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,805
<i>Oh, what's wrong with me?</i>

468
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,974
<i>To have feelings for a girl...</i>

469
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,308
<i>other than Otsu...</i>

470
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:57,643
<i>Cat ears are...</i>

471
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,178
<i>Cat ears are...</i>

472
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,313
<i>Puuuuuuur‐fect!</i>

473
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,281
The next episode..

474
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,196
<i>It's a game where you</i>
<i>talk to a seaman</i>

475
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,465
<i>type unemployed</i>
<i>middle‐aged man</i>

476
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:22,334
<i>who is a DORK so you can</i>
<i>help him get a job.</i>

477
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,572
<i>Basically,</i> <i>even</i> <i>if</i> <i>you</i>
<i>start</i> <i>a</i> <i>conversation,</i>

478
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,973
<i>the DORK will ignore you.</i>

479
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,976
<i>That's</i> <i>because</i> <i>he</i> <i>already</i> <i>has</i> <i>his</i>
<i>hands</i> <i>full</i> <i>with</i> <i>his</i> <i>own</i> <i>life.</i>

480
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,212
<i>He'll get depressed sometimes.</i>

481
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,214
<i>You may want to give him</i>
<i>encouragement,</i>

482
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:36,448
<i>but you must not talk to him.</i>

483
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,251
<i>You</i> <i>must</i> <i>never</i> <i>say</i> <i>to</i> <i>him</i>
<i>"try</i> <i>your</i> <i>best."</i>

484
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,054
<i>Because</i> <i>he</i> <i>is</i> <i>already</i>
<i>trying</i> <i>his</i> <i>best.</i>

485
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,025
<i>Sometimes,</i> <i>he'll</i> <i>try</i> <i>to</i> <i>play</i> <i>with</i>
<i>a</i> <i>rope</i> <i>hanging</i> <i>from</i> <i>the</i> <i>ceiling.</i>

486
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,194
<i>When</i> <i>that</i> <i>happens,</i> <i>push</i> <i>the</i> <i>B</i>
<i>button</i> <i>repeatedly</i> <i>to</i> <i>cut</i> <i>the</i> <i>rope.</i>

487
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,064
<i>Sometimes,</i> <i>he</i> <i>may</i> <i>just</i> <i>stare</i>
<i>at</i> <i>the</i> <i>string</i> <i>hanging</i>

488
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,165
<i>from the light and say</i>

489
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,367
<i>"move rope...</i>
<i>move rope."</i>

490
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,769
<i>When that happens...</i>

491
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,371
<i>push the B button</i>
<i>repeatedly as well.</i>

492
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,274
<i>Sometimes,</i> <i>a</i> <i>strange</i> <i>woman</i>
<i>may</i> <i>pay</i> <i>him</i> <i>a</i> <i>visit.</i>

493
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,110
<i>When</i> <i>that</i> <i>happens,</i>
<i>just</i> <i>shout</i> <i>out</i> <i>loud, "Next!"</i>

494
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,412
<i>Very loudly.</i>

495
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:09,910
<i>In the end, the</i> <i>only</i> <i>word</i> <i>he</i>
<i>can</i> <i>say</i> <i>is</i> <i>"next!"</i>
