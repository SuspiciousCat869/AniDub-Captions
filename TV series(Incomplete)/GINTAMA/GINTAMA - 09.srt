1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,605
<i>My</i> <i>sister,</i> Otae works
at a hostess bar

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,607
<i>and met a man with</i>
<i>a very hairy butt.</i>

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,711
Say, if you had a boyfriend, and...

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,413
....if his rear end looked like
an afro, what would you do?

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,749
I would love him,
butt 'fro and all.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,219
Otae dear, will you marry me?!!!

7
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,222
<i>In order to thwart this self‐proclaimed</i>
<i>Stalker of Love</i>

8
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:26,193
<i>Gin declares that he's engaged to my</i>
<i>sister and ends up challenged to a duel.</i>

9
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,628
‐Let's go!
‐A fair...

10
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:29,463
‐Fight!
‐Fight!

11
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:31,632
Hold on a second!

12
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:32,432
The blade! Huh?

13
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,701
The tip is gone!
The tip is...

14
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:43,110
<i>Gin won the duel but with a cowardly trick</i>
<i>that you could hardly call heroic.</i>

15
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,269
<i>Vice Chief!</i>

16
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,972
Is it true that the chief
was jilted by some chick?

17
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,008
And then he lost her in
a duel to some weird loser

18
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,010
who used dirty tricks on him?

19
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,479
Getting shot down by the ladies
is nothing new for him,

20
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,447
but I can't believe
that he lost a fight!

21
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,117
Just who exactly is this silver haired
samurai anyway?

22
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,086
Pipe down, we're in
a meeting right now.

23
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:36,089
And there's no way that Kondo
would ever lose a duel.

24
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,892
Who is the idiot who's been
spreading such stupid rumors?

25
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,594
It was Captain Okita!

26
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,096
He was blasting it
over the loudspeaker.

27
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:46,033
I heard it from you,
Vice Chief Hijikata.

28
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,037
I was the idiot for telling
that idiot loud mouth.

29
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:50,804
What the hell?

30
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,739
You were the one who started
the rumor after all!

31
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,107
What's with that cocky look
on your face?

32
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:54,941
Quit messing around!

33
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,109
So what, then?

34
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,045
Are you saying
those rumors are true?

35
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,018
Shut the hell up!

36
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,957
You wanna talk about private affairs
during the meeting?

37
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,759
You can spill your guts, literally.

38
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,629
Yamazaki, you're the first batter up.

39
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:17,731
What, me?

40
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,833
‐But I didn't say anything.
‐I'm pretty sure I can hear you...

41
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,768
...speaking right now,
you maggot!

42
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,371
<i>But I didn't...</i>

43
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,973
Hey, what's up, guys?

44
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,676
This meeting's pretty lively
for a change.

45
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,445
Right!
Okay, everyone,

46
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,214
let's go out there and do
our civic duty, shall we?

47
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,051
What's wrong?

48
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,929
<i>So then it's all right?</i>

49
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,165
You'll go at it anyway,
even if I try to stop you.

50
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't worry yourself
about it, Vice Chief.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,069
We'll definitely find him
without fail!

52
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,971
All right, let's go, men!

53
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:58,672
‐Right!
‐Right!

54
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,047
They just don't get it.

55
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,718
<i>Do those guys actually think</i>
<i>that they can beat</i>

56
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,720
<i>the person who defeated Kondo?</i>

57
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,790
Now listen up!

58
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,358
It's just one opponent!

59
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,060
<i>Find him no matter</i>
<i>what it takes!</i>

60
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,062
<i>For the honor of the Shinsengumi!</i>

61
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,931
Our target is
a silver haired samurai!

62
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,870
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

63
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,206
You're not thinking of trying
to beat me, are you?

64
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,642
You know what that is?
That's beyond reckless.

65
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,511
Its borderline arrogance,
your ego is so bloated.

66
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,012
You make me wanna burp.

67
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,816
Well, if you plan on fighting,
fight like your life is on the line.

68
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,452
I'll make it so that you'll never
be able to burp again.

69
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:51,024
I'm not so lame that I'll surrender
to all of your big talk,

70
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,561
because this fight won't be settled
with burping, but with brains.

71
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,898
Hey, who cares about
the burping?

72
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,232
Just get on with it!

73
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,072
<i>Good evening, everyone.</i>

74
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,774
<i>I'm Shinpachi Shimura.</i>

75
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:11,011
<i>It seems like every day the trees</i>
<i>are turning greener and greener.</i>

76
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,580
<i>By the way, the reason</i>
<i>why we're scowling</i>

77
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,315
<i>at each other</i>
<i>like this is because...</i>

78
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,551
<i>Well, actually,</i>
<i>it's pretty complicated.</i>

79
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,854
<i>Hey! Iâ€™m Princess Layer!</i>

80
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,023
<i>The great space war has finally begun,</i>

81
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,659
<i>but I don't really understand</i>
<i>all the complicated stuff.</i>

82
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,429
<i>All I can say is, may the</i>
<i>horse be with you!</i>

83
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,199
So, hey, you guys,

84
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,101
I can hear everything you guys are
thinking loud and clear, you know!

85
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,504
Are you pretending
to be stupid, numbskulls?

86
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,805
<i>Leave us alone.</i>

87
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,607
<i>This is a part of our strategy!</i>

88
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,777
<i>And what do you mean by</i>
<i>"pretending" to be stupid?</i>

89
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,745
<i>They're already telling us</i>
<i>that this anime</i>

90
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,714
<i>is too hard for kids</i>
<i>to understand.</i>

91
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,050
<i>Cut the crap, or we won't just</i>
<i>get our budget reduced,</i>

92
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,218
<i>but we'll be cancelled!</i>

93
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:54,187
<i>This... Gintoki shouted from</i>
<i>deep within his heart.</i>

94
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,056
<i>Gintoki shouted, you say?</i>

95
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,891
<i>Why don't you stop</i>
<i>copying us, Gin?!</i>

96
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,025
<i>Dumb ass!</i>

97
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,494
<i>As if I'd give you the upper hand</i>
<i>in something like this.</i>

98
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,362
<i>That's right.</i>

99
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,198
<i>This is the one match</i>
<i>that we can't ever lose.</i>

100
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,869
How did it turn out
like this, I wonder?

101
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,572
Well, just take a look at this!

102
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,142
<i>It all started with</i>
<i>the Odd Jobs gang at home.</i>

103
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:21,014
<i>Gintoki, Shinpachi, and Kagura</i>
<i>were going about their lazy daily lives</i>

104
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,817
<i>but then came a client who shattered</i>
<i>the peace and quiet.</i>

105
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,754
<i>That man was none other</i>
<i>than the advisor</i>

106
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,557
<i>of the Kabukicho Town Council</i>
<i>"slash" Carpenter,</i>

107
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,126
<i>Ishida Pierre Genpachi</i>
<i>Saymaru.</i>

108
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,061
<i>Age 63, a Virgo.</i>

109
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,897
<i>His request was for help</i>
<i>with his carpentering.</i>

110
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,468
<i>However, the request happened</i>
<i>to have had a frightening catch to it.</i>

111
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,037
<i>He only wanted one person.</i>

112
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,905
<i>One person to do</i>
<i>all the work!</i>

113
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,176
<i>They reacted to the news instantly.</i>

114
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:54,614
<i>High level negotiations began,</i>
<i>voices and hands going non‐stop.</i>

115
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:58,051
<i>Proposals</i> <i>were</i> <i>put</i> <i>forth</i>
<i>only</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>rejected</i> <i>immediately.</i>

116
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,520
<i>But when the dust</i>
<i>had finally settled,</i>

117
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,822
<i>they had decided on the best</i>
<i>method to choose</i>

118
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,457
<i>the one who would do</i>
<i>all the work.</i>

119
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,627
<i>The mother of all competitive sports.</i>

120
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,696
<i>Rock, paper, scissors!</i>

121
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,277
All right, best out of one!

122
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,612
No objections?

123
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,448
<i>If I lose,</i>
<i>its manual labor!</i>

124
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,650
<i>I can't afford to lose this match</i>
<i>no matter what!</i>

125
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,485
<i>I'll use any trick</i>
<i>that I can.</i>

126
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,654
<i>I simply have to win!</i>

127
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,423
Here we go! Rock!

128
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,024
Howacha!

129
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,427
Hey, what're you doing, Kagura?

130
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,861
This is rock, paper, scissors!

131
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,364
There's no benefit in
showing your hand early!

132
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,666
The early bird
guts the worm!

133
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,968
Do you have any idea
how this game works at all?

134
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,969
All right!

135
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,472
If that's how you guys
want to play, so be it.

136
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,673
I'll play your game!

137
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,610
Hey! What ever happened
to rock, paper and scissors?

138
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,945
Come on you guys!

139
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,580
Ready?
Best of one!

140
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,549
No buts, ands or ifs!

141
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,385
Rock, paper, scissors... and go!

142
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,054
Hey, hey, hey!

143
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,989
You know you can't beat
your opponent by copying them.

144
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,792
We're just going to keep trying
unless you can be a bit more original.

145
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,295
In my family,
the girl wins if its a tie.

146
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,363
Oh, is that so?

147
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,997
Well we are on earth,
and in case you didn't know,

148
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,466
on earth we play
with earth rules!

149
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,535
Says the guy who's never
followed a rule in his life.

150
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,108
Rock, paper, scissors!

151
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,846
What are you jerks
trying to pull this time?

152
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,747
What is that?

153
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,348
Are you a total idiot or what?

154
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,850
This is a crab, obviously.

155
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,185
I'll admit your crab
is better than a rock.

156
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,921
But you still can't beat
this family of five.

157
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,923
Whose family
is that supposed to be?

158
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,393
We omitted Meg
in the Japanese version.

159
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,162
Did you not hear me when I said
this was rock, paper, scissors?

160
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,563
I guess you lose, Shinpachi.

161
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,198
Looking forward to
the money you bring back!

162
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,800
What?
Why do I lose?

163
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,668
You two should lose
for trying to cheat!

164
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,536
Don't give me that!

165
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,872
You know you're just jealous
of my great intellect!

166
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,973
Don't be a baby!

167
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,041
You guys are cheaters!

168
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,642
Come on, there are rules
in this world!

169
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,778
Everyone knows rules
are made to be broken.

170
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,246
Don't be stupid!

171
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,383
Fine, Gintoki wins.

172
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,851
Victory!

173
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,953
What?

174
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,322
That's just too bad, loser.

175
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,324
Don't bother coming back
until you finish.

176
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,128
That's right, Shinpachi,
the customer is always right.

177
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,730
Listen to whatever he says.

178
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,466
Hey wait, you've got
the wrong guy!

179
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,867
Quit your yapping.

180
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,804
The winner is blessed with
the privilege of doing this job,

181
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,305
and you can thank me later.

182
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,107
No, that's not what we... huh?

183
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,376
What?

184
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,311
‐Have a nice day.
‐Have a nice day.

185
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,129
You'll never get away,
silver haired samurai!

186
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,697
Show yourself!

187
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,766
All right, over here!

188
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,734
Hey, listen mister.

189
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,970
You know I haven't actually
agreed to this yet.

190
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,005
All you do is complain!

191
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,108
Hurry up and haul
these supplies to the site.

192
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:10,376
There he is!

193
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,312
The silver haired bastard!

194
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,681
We've got you now,
silver haired samurai!

195
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,385
That's...

196
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,754
Saliva'n and some rice...?

197
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,224
Seconds, please!

198
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,626
‐You should watch what you eat, fatty!
‐You should watch what you eat, fatty!

199
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:27,827
We found him!

200
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,329
The silver haired samurai
is over there!

201
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,464
There's no escape,
silver haired samurai!

202
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:39,038
‐This is...
‐A barber chair and a samurai?

203
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,040
How would you like it cut?

204
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,942
I think just trim it.

205
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,377
‐Just shave it off, baldy!
‐Just shave it off, baldy!

206
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,792
Get a move on already.

207
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,528
There's a mountain of work
to be done.

208
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,696
You just don't get it, do you?

209
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,398
To have a healthy work environment,

210
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,833
you have to inspire your employees

211
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,635
‐and keep them in good spirits.
‐Sure thing.

212
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,804
Just make sure you don't fall
and turn into a ghost.

213
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:12,839
Wear this.

214
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,477
<i>What was that?</i>

215
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,479
They turned the city upside down

216
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,481
by putting up signs
all over Edo City,

217
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,849
and so now everyone
and their mother

218
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,317
knows about Kondo losing?

219
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:27,587
Yeah, they're all really
going bananas out there.

220
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,157
Although they don't seem to have
anything to show for it yet.

221
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,993
That bunch of stupid apes.

222
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,895
What do they think
they're going to achieve

223
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,498
by telling the entire population
that our chief can be bested.

224
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,133
Well, what do you wanna do?

225
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,734
If we sit back and do nothing,

226
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,870
we'll just be causing trouble
for everyone

227
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,706
and we'll be dragging the Shinsengumi's
reputation through the mud.

228
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,243
Let's go, Okita.

229
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,011
But where are we going?

230
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,148
What do you mean?
Kill him?

231
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,683
Yeah, kill him.

232
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,785
Do you mean
the silver haired samurai?

233
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,287
Yeah, I'll have
to kill him off myself

234
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,356
before this mess
gets any bigger.

235
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:07,060
Vice chief, it troubles me that
every other word you say is "kill."

236
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,396
History teaches us that nothing good
ever comes to assassins.

237
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,298
This isn't an assassination.

238
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,334
I'll walk up to him
and strike him down.

239
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,702
You know, I have an idea.

240
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,537
If you just haul in any
old guy and dress them up

241
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,606
to look like
that silver haired samurai,

242
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,941
that should be good enough
to satisfy the troops.

243
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,843
How about this guy?

244
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,379
Here, hold this
wooden sword properly.

245
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,880
Hey gramps, do me a favor

246
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,083
and crack that idiot's skull
open with that sword.

247
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,219
Hijikata, sir, I know at first glance
he's not very scary,

248
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,854
but take off his glasses
and look!

249
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,022
The legend, Musashi!

250
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,191
That cool face
is wasted on you!

251
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,731
Are you really planning
to kill that guy?

252
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,900
The only thing we know about him
is that he's got silver hair.

253
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,437
He's not just any regular guy
if he's able to beat Kondo.

254
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,306
I'll know him
when I see him.

255
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:57,877
Yeah, it's me.

256
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,213
Really?

257
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,347
Got it.

258
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,416
Did they find him then?

259
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,419
Yamazaki found someone
who fits the samurai's description.

260
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,054
Hurry up, let's go!

261
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,691
This is the place.

262
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,431
Shinsengumi, put your hands up
where I can see them!

263
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,868
Can we help you
with something?

264
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,838
‐This is...
‐a really super‐poor samurai?

265
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,508
Oh, fits the description?

266
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,109
It barely sounds alike!

267
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,012
Get back here and
commit harakiri, Yamazaki!

268
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,417
<i>‐You are done for!</i>
‐A silver haired samurai, huh?

269
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,619
I wonder where in the world
he could be?

270
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,189
You blockhead!

271
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,059
Put more of your heart and soul
into that hammer, would you?

272
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,962
I'd probably be able to if it was your
head this nail was going into, baldy.

273
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,464
What was that, fur ball?

274
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,466
Stop blabbering on
and move your hands,

275
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,535
you damned silver haired mophead!

276
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,638
Well, we can't find him anywhere.

277
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,506
I still don't think
you have enough clues,

278
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,008
so why don't we go back?

279
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,245
Remember, I gotta watch my favorite
comedy show that starts at four o'clock.

280
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,614
When did they switch the times?

281
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:11,617
I'm pretty sure there's been
a drama rerun showing at four.

282
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,086
Oh, is that so?

283
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,087
Oh well.

284
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,756
But hey, that drama is supposed
to have a happy ending.

285
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,025
Aren't you the same
as the rest of us?

286
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:23,863
You pretend like you don't care,
but deep down you're furious.

287
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,467
Huh, I wonder why.

288
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,569
<i>You haven't forgotten, have you?</i>

289
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:32,972
<i>Back when we were stuck in the</i>
<i>countryside, filled with anger,</i>

290
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:36,008
<i>it was none other than Kondo</i>
<i>that took us in.</i>

291
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,913
<i>We were able to walk around town with</i>
<i>our heads held high as Shinsengumi...</i>

292
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,216
<i>like this because of that man.</i>

293
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,187
We made the decision
to follow him to the end.

294
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,790
Isn't that right, Okita?

295
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,725
Now go, Sadomaru Number 3.

296
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,794
The target is that guy's butt.

297
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,296
Hey you, are you even
listening to me?

298
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,564
Damn it!

299
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,200
‐Hey, look out below, brother.
‐What?

300
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,739
Hey, hey, that's dangerous!

301
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,441
That's why I said,
look out below.

302
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,510
But why don't you say it
with a bit more urgency?

303
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,577
What's wrong with you?

304
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,979
Hey, shut your hole.

305
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:16,682
Like I'm supposed to listen to a stranger
coach me on dramatic delivery, ah?

306
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,854
It's you, that bomb suspect!

307
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,639
It's you, that bomb suspect!

308
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,077
Oh yeah, I forgot that jerk
had silver hair too.

309
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,547
Okay, who are you again?

310
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,416
Oh, is that you, Johnny?

311
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,286
Oh my, look how grown up
you've become.

312
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,222
What's up? Is your pet gold fish
still alive and strong?

313
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,724
<i>Hey, Gintoki, hurry up!</i>

314
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,059
<i>I need your hand up here!</i>

315
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,093
Be right up!

316
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,628
See ya, Johnny.

317
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,863
Gotta get back to work.

318
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,568
He just left.

319
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,036
Whatcha gonna do, Johnny?

320
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,704
Who are you calling Johnny,
you idiot?

321
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:16,075
I can't believe he just forgot about me
after just three or four episodes!

322
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,778
Yeah, I mean, I think most people
would forget you.

323
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:21,380
Okita, please lend me
your sword.

324
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,717
Give me a break.

325
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,652
Working all day with this baldy

326
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,622
is going to make me start
losing my hair as well.

327
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,024
Sheesh! If help weren't so hard
to find these days,

328
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,060
I would never ask
you guys for it.

329
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,963
Don't screw that up, you hear?

330
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,798
And same to you, baldy.

331
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,969
First bomb disposal,
and now roof repair?

332
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,671
You don't have an ounce
of pride, do you?

333
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,441
Exactly, what kind of stunt
are you trying to pull up here?

334
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,109
Bomb disposal?

335
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,819
Hey, man, aren't you that...?

336
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,188
You finally remembered, eh?

337
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:06,359
<i>Even in the Shinsengumi, there's no one</i>
<i>who'd do something that insane.</i>

338
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:13,165
I couldn't believe it at first when I
heard someone had beat Kondo,

339
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,402
but if it's you, it might actually
be possible.

340
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,071
Kondo who?

341
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,974
You two fought over
a woman, didn't you?

342
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,177
Was she really all that?

343
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,613
Why don't you introduce me to her?

344
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,884
Huh? What's this?

345
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,185
The tip broke!

346
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,524
Wait, so you're friends
with that gorilla butt?

347
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,860
But what are you coming
after me for?

348
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,438
Hey, asshole,
what's the big idea?

349
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,775
He may be a gorilla butt...

350
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,244
but to us,
he's our beloved general!

351
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:03,316
We built the Shinsengumi from the ground
up with nothing but our swords.

352
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,351
He's my brother‐in‐arms!

353
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,388
I won't let anyone humiliate
the Shinsengumi

354
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,958
and if anyone dares
to dirty our name...

355
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,760
then I'll send them
straight to hell!

356
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,500
It's time to watch my TV!

357
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,512
Hey, loser!

358
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,215
Didn't anybody teach you
not to run around with knives?

359
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,692
What was that?

360
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,594
Hey, Gin man!

361
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,764
I ain't paying you if
you're going to just play around!

362
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,065
Shut up, baldy!

363
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,867
Call the police,
we got a problem!

364
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,036
But I am the police.

365
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,338
Oh, yeah, that's right.

366
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,073
Man, this world is so messed up.

367
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,776
I guess you're right.

368
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,213
<i>I just can't figure</i>
<i>this guy out.</i>

369
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,751
<i>I heard he pulled a dirty trick</i>
<i>against Kondo,</i>

370
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,886
<i>but he's not doing anything</i>
<i>like that now.</i>

371
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,187
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>

372
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,823
<i>he's not even trying to use</i>
<i>the sword I gave him.</i>

373
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,193
<i>Could it be...</i>

374
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,596
<i>this guy's going easy</i>
<i>on me even though...</i>

375
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,232
<i>I'm obviously trying</i>
<i>to take his life?</i>

376
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,133
<i>Damn!</i>

377
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,367
Fight back!

378
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,405
Killing a guy one sidedly will just leave
a really bad taste in my mouth!

379
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,473
Draw that sword!

380
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,680
Well, now we're talking.

381
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,983
It's your life or mine!

382
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,354
I got him!
What?

383
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,390
What the...?

384
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,528
He dodged me?

385
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,729
I'm screwed!

386
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,316
Alright, fight's over.

387
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:19,785
Ow, ow, ow...!

388
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,089
Hey, baldy, I need to go
to the hospital!

389
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,523
Hold it!

390
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,993
Are you trying
to show me mercy?

391
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,262
Show you mercy?

392
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:34,133
If I had any of that, I'd put it
in my rice and eat it, but...

393
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,804
The thing about fighting
is that its only worth it

394
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,740
when you have
something to protect.

395
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,076
Just like when you were trying
to protect the Shinsengumi.

396
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,313
Trying to protect?

397
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:49,415
Then, what are you trying
to protect?

398
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,621
My way of life, man.

399
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,257
See ya.

400
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,633
What a funny guy he is.

401
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,736
Makes me want to try
crossing swords with him myself.

402
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,304
Forget it, Okita.

403
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,374
Even you would have
a tough time, trust me.

404
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,445
That man may be pointing
his blade at you,

405
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,014
but he's fighting something
that is much bigger

406
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,883
than any one of us.

407
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:28,888
For him, it's beyond winning
and losing or right and wrong.

408
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,192
I'm very sorry, Kondo sir.

409
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,694
Looks like he beat me too.

410
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,063
<i>The heck is this?</i>

411
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,360
<i>Kagura, If you're gonna</i>
<i>pick up strays,</i>

412
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,334
<i>pick up something</i>
<i>at least we know the name of!</i>

413
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,003
<i>Huh? You want to keep it?</i>

414
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:27,239
<i>No way, no way! Daddy is</i>
<i>not okay with this at all!</i>

415
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,040
<i>The next episode...</i>
