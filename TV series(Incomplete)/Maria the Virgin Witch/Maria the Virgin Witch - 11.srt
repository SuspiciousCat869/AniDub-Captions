1
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,416
[ANN] My story is set
in the olden days,

2
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,875
when we of France were still
at war with England.

3
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,416
There was a young witch
living near our village,

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,000
who hated wars with every
beat of her fiery heart.

5
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:38,416
The witch plied no trade in
curses or hexes or evil deeds.

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,791
Instead, she sought to end all
conflict by sheer force of will.

7
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,458
Her name was Maria. The same
as the Blessed Mother.

8
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:51,875
And just like her holiest of
namesakes, Maria was a virgin.

9
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,083
That fateful day, despite
the loss of her magic,

10
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,583
Maria sped towards the
battlefield with all haste.

11
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,750
Was it recklessness or courage
that burned within her?

12
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,958
Or perhaps...

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,083
[GILBERT whimpers]

14
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,375
[RÉGLISSE] Meow.
The shield's fading, Master!

15
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:58,875
[GILBERT gasps] Dear God. The
medicine was the work of a--!

16
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,541
Brother Gilbert.
What of the witches?

17
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,916
They must all be
brought to judgment,

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,750
and burn for their audacity.

19
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,958
Huh? So, the weird fog
that paralyzed me was...

20
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,583
Forgive me, Maria.

21
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,625
Had I known their intent,

22
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,250
I never would've
sold the mixture.

23
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,041
Nobody blames you, Edwina.
None of this was your fault.

24
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,333
[RÉGLISSE] The monk said the
barber-surgeon had need of it,

25
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,916
so I merely assumed.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,541
Master! What if the gunpowder
was also used for villainy?

27
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,708
It was meant as a curative.

28
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,625
Oh, Réglisse, I shudder to
think what they did with it!

29
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,666
Pardon me, but do you think
the other guild members

30
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,916
are going to come?

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,500
Well, Viv did say she
would track them down.

32
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,791
No! I can't believe I left her
behind at my place!

33
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,041
[RÉGLISSE]
I'll go to her right meow!

34
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,208
Fly like the wind!

35
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,500
And the battle.
How far away are we?

36
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,041
Do you really wanna go there?

37
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,125
Even without use of
your magic, Maria?

38
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:56,000
[MARIA] It doesn't matter!
I have to be there!

39
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,750
[CHANTAL] Anybody know why she
had us rush back home?

40
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,041
The gate's been blown to bits.

41
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,958
There's not much
left to see here.

42
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,833
Not to mention, there's
no sign of Viv or Edwina.

43
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,916
[SUZANNE] Say, what if
the trouble Maria's in

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,791
has nothing to do with
the fight below?

45
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,458
You don't think that the Church
got the better of her, do you?

46
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,708
--[ALL] Not a chance.
--[explosion]

47
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,041
Uh?

48
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,041
[FRENCH MESSENGER A]
Milord, the gate has fallen.

49
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,500
The English continue
to harry our vanguard,

50
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,083
but our victory's
all but assured!

51
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,916
Excellent! Notify our forces to
advance! Lay claim to the fort!

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,958
Sir!

53
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,083
[GUILLAUME]
At last, a day of reckoning.

54
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:34,916
I wonder. Will Joseph finally
unsheathe his blade?

55
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:35,833
[GALFA grunts]

56
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:36,458
[JOSEPH groans]

57
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,833
Look at you!

58
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:44,583
[GALFA chuckles] What's the
matter, Joseph? Afraid?

59
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,375
[JOSEPH]
Tell me!

60
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,750
[GALFA]
Huh?

61
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,375
[JOSEPH] Why did you steal...
Lady Maria's purity?

62
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,875
[GALFA] Ha, ha.
That's just work, y'know?

63
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,291
Devil.

64
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,541
Damned if I'd bed a witch
otherwise, pretty or not.

65
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,291
Who knows what pox I'd catch?

66
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,333
[JOSEPH]
Galfa!

67
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,375
[GALFA grunts]

68
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,333
[GALFA chuckles]

69
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,666
[JOSEPH]
Was it the monk?

70
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,291
Did the monk pay
you to do this?

71
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,750
[GALFA] Why don't you
go ask him yourself?

72
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,083
[GALFA chuckles]
Show a little respect, Joseph.

73
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,916
After all, this is a church.

74
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,333
Why are you so angry?

75
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,791
So what if I took your
little witch's virginity?

76
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:27,416
That's far better than her being
burnt at the stake, ain't it?

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,125
[JOSEPH] How dare you? You speak
as though you did her a mercy!

78
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,000
[GALFA] Maybe you're just mad
that I've tasted her favors,

79
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,208
and you haven't!

80
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,291
[JOSEPH yells]

81
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,250
Put down the sword. You don't
get that arm tended to

82
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,083
right quick, you're
gonna bleed to death.

83
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,041
Even if you live,
Guillaume will abandon you.

84
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,541
Your master's ashamed.

85
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,291
All this for a witch.
God, what a waste.

86
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,833
You could never know her value!

87
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,166
I'll make you beg for your
life at milady's feet!

88
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,666
[GALFA]
Hmph. I'd like to see you try.

89
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,041
[meow]

90
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,083
I'm awake, you can
stop mewling now.

91
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,208
You shouldn't be
sitting up yet.

92
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,125
Just relax. I'll fetch
your medicine--

93
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,500
[VIV]
Hold on.

94
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,666
How is she?

95
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,083
Maria? My master rushed
in and saved her.

96
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,708
Wait, Edwina?

97
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,250
[RÉGLISSE] Uh-huh. And now the
two of them are heading to a

98
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,833
fortress, which your besieged
countrymen fight to defend.

99
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:25,916
What for?

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,583
[RÉGLISSE]
I'm not entirely sure.

101
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,583
Devoid of magic as she is,

102
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,958
it's not like Maria can
halt the bloodshed.

103
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,875
My goodness.
What a spine she's got.

104
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,250
[clanging]

105
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,375
Now! Claim recompense!

106
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,166
[MERCENARY A]
Look alive, Lolotte!

107
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,416
You'll miss out on the best
of the spoils at this rate!

108
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,666
Yeah, thanks for the tip!

109
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,416
Those mercenaries
vex me almost unto death!

110
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,625
Lay low the defenders before
you pick the town dry!

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,625
[BELLA]
I guess it's almost over.

112
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,375
Probably no money to be made
around these parts anyway.

113
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,666
I wonder if we should
head east next.

114
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,875
[CHANTAL]
Hm... 

115
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,000
What's wrong?

116
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,125
I can't figure out why humans

117
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,000
continue to do the same
things over and over again.

118
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,041
Look at them scramble
about, like ants.

119
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,666
[panting]

120
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,375
Hey, there's plenty of fish
in the sea, you know.

121
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,083
Go hook yourself a fresh one.

122
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,958
[JOSEPH gasps]

123
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:35,333
[GALFA growls] Those eyes!
I've a mind to pluck 'em out!

124
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,625
I've hated 'em from the very
first time you looked at me!

125
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,833
You look at the world like a
goddamn babe in arms!

126
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,375
I don't know who
your father was,

127
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,833
but I'm sure as hell you never
had to worry about food

128
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,916
or clothes or a roof
over your head!

129
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,833
[GALFA] That's why you're here,
bleeding like a stuck pig

130
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,291
over your damned Maria!

131
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,666
'Cause you've never had
to face the consequences!

132
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,416
Cry out! Do it!
Beg for your life!

133
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,708
Stop worrying about the witch
and save your own neck!

134
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,208
Come on!

135
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:10,333
Ever since I met you, I've
been envious of you, Galfa.

136
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,041
Envious of what you possessed!

137
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,125
The hell?

138
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,958
[JOSEPH] Ambition guides
your every step.

139
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,583
And though it is a path of evil,

140
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,666
you have the strength to
see your dream fulfilled!

141
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,666
You do what you want, in pursuit
of a larger goal, and in that,

142
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,916
you remind me of no one
more than Maria herself!

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,750
[GALFA]
What?

144
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,750
[JOSEPH]
And that's why...

145
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:34,291
You will beg her forgiveness for
daring to threaten her!

146
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,583
How dare you compare
me to that witch?!

147
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,250
I should cut out your tongue
for saying that, Joseph!

148
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,125
Has the girl had
to fight, and claw,

149
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,083
and kill for
everything she's got?

150
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:49,041
[JOSEPH] I don't want to kill
you, Galfa, but I will!

151
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,208
You bade me to deliver
medicine crafted by a witch.

152
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,125
Did you know the provenance
of those herbs

153
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,583
when you sent me to fetch them,
time and again?

154
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,583
I did.

155
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,750
Uh? Why would you
do such a thing?

156
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,333
That medicine was sorely
needed by the people.

157
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,166
The hands what mixed
it matter not.

158
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,666
[GILBERT] You speak
of contact with a witch

159
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,250
in phrases cavalier.
Feel you no shred of remorse?

160
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:15,375
If something can be exploited in
pursuit of bettering this world,

161
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,916
I do not blush at it.
It doesn't matter if it's

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,708
politics, war, witches.
Even God Himself.

163
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,708
[GILBERT gasps]

164
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,583
[GALFA grunts]

165
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,916
[sighs] Maybe Viv and Maria
aren't coming out.

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,750
[CHANTAL]
Uh...

167
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:37,583
[SUZANNE]
What is that?!

168
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,500
[BELLA]
Huh?

169
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,375
[MARIA]
Everybody outta the way!

170
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,041
[ALL scream]

171
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,791
That sounded like...

172
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:44,625
...Maria!

173
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,125
[CANNON SOLDIER A yawns]

174
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,166
Huh?

175
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,625
Uh, Vraiment?

176
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,833
Hey! Maria! Your staff!

177
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,916
[sighs] Or, just go.

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,708
We need to find Joseph! Hurry!

179
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:04,541
[PRIAPUS]
Right, Master!

180
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,875
[ARTEMIS]
Leave it to us!

181
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,291
[JOSEPH yells]

182
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,375
[PRIAPUS]
Artemis! He's over here!

183
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,291
[ARTEMIS]
Where?

184
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,625
[PRIAPUS]
What do we do now?

185
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,750
At this rate, he's not going
to last much longer!

186
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,791
[ARTEMIS]
I'll fetch Maria!

187
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,208
[PRIAPUS]
Take this!

188
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:44,958
[JOSEPH gasps]

189
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,666
[GALFA]
Get away!

190
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,500
[JOSEPH]
Priapus? But how?

191
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,166
I'm gonna run you through!

192
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,208
[MARIA yells]

193
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,000
[GALFA]
Huh?

194
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,166
[GALFA groans]

195
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,083
[MARIA grunts]

196
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,000
[ARTEMIS]
Are you all right?

197
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,208
Well. I still
don't have one.

198
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,041
[JOSEPH] Lady Maria?
What are you doing here?

199
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,041
Need you ask? I was
saving your life.

200
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,541
Yes, Milady. I'm in your debt.

201
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,916
[MARIA]
May I ask you something?

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,041
Yes.

203
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,916
How dumb do
you have to be

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,583
to try your hand
at warfare again?!

205
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,041
Uh! What?

206
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,958
[MARIA] Remember that battle
after you kissed my hand?

207
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,500
I had to save you then, too!

208
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,583
[GALFA]
Look who's here!

209
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,708
Ah. Came back for more,
huh? Very good.

210
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,666
[JOSEPH]
Milady! The help is appreciated,

211
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,250
but get yourself to safety!

212
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,083
I will take care
of this villain!

213
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,583
It's my lucky day.

214
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,625
What I started in
your hut the other night.

215
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,166
Right in front of dear Joseph.

216
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,541
How dare you
speak to her like that?

217
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,791
Joseph?

218
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,375
I'm sick to death of you
judging me, you bastard!

219
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,208

220
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,125

221

226
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:22,791
[JOSEPH] How dare you?!
How dare you say such a thing?!

[JOSEPH grunting]

228
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,125
Joseph?

229
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,250
Joseph!

230
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,458
[MARIA]
Stop it! You have to stop!

231
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,000
You're going to
kill him! Please!

232
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,125
[JOSEPH gasps]

233
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,708
But, I'd...

234
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,791
[LOLOTTE]
Joseph? Fancy meeting you here!

235
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,875
You haven't seen Galfa
about, have you?

236
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,291
He said he wanted to loot
the church's sacristy.

237
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,791
What a sight!
Very well done, Joseph.

238

[GALFA groans]

239
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,458
Oh, is he still alive?

240
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,291
I'm sure he had it coming,

241
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,791
but how 'bout you let me
take him off your hands?

242
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:07,416
Huh?

243
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,166
Yeah?

244
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,125
[LOLOTTE] Hold this for me,
would you, dear?

245
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,208
[MARIA]
Uh!

246
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,750
[LOLOTTE]
If a chief isn't around...

247
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:19,958
Sometimes the nobles try to
welsh on the agreed-upon rate.

248
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:25,250
Why the long face, kid? You just
bested a killer in combat.

249
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,333

[CERNUNNOS]
I am no one. Forgotten.

261
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,666
I keep a lonely vigil.

262
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,041
Are you a friend of
Maria's, perhaps?

263
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,375
[CERNUNNOS]
Perhaps. But are you?

264
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,625
How come people treat
Maria so badly?

265
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,875
Why are they mean?

266
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,125

Huh?

268
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,833
[CERNUNNOS]

Forgetting can be
a mercy, child.

Maria is not a
member of humanity.

you feel shall be--

No! I won't!

273
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,041
Maria's one of my
favorite people!

274
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,125
I'll never forget her!

275
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,458
So don't you try to take Maria
away from me, you buncha smoke!

276
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,166
[CERNUNNOS chuckles]

277
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,375
[MARIA] That's right. If Edwina
hadn't come when she did,

278
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,166
they would have
burned me at the stake.

279
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,333
[JOSEPH]
Burned at the stake?

280
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,250
How did they reach a
verdict so quickly?

281
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,208
And Le Comte said you would
be banished from the land,

282
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,333
at the very worst.

283
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,416
What am I saying?
Are you badly hurt?

284
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,458
Hey. We can talk
about this later.

285
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,625
If only that were so.

286
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:09,208
Lady Maria, leave this
place without me.

287
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,458
[MARIA]
Huh?

288
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,333
I do not have the right
to stand at your side

289
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,708
after how I've behaved.

290
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,208
[MARIA]
What are you going on about?

291
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:20,500
I, well... I share your
vision of a world in which

292
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,541
bloodshed has no place,
but that didn't stop me

293
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,125
from beating a man near
unto death just now.

294
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,666
[MARIA]
It weighs upon you?

295
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,041
It does. My whole life.

296
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,250
I have strived to be
an upright person.

297
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,083
Righteous in word and
deed to all whom I meet.

298
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,708
And now, I espy
the beast within.

299
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,458
Joseph, you attacked him
to keep me free from harm.

300
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,250
[JOSEPH]
That's true, Milady,

301
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,083
but even after you
were safe, I beat him.

302
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,375
He'd earned a bit of that.

303
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,625
[JOSEPH]
No. I'm merely a puppet

304
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,500
that leaps at his
master's command.

305
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:54,125
A painted fool, devoid
of purpose or will.

306
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,125
[ARTEMIS] Did he always grate
so on the nerves, Priapus?

307
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,958
[PRIAPUS] He should count his
blessings. One, especially.

308
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,250
[MARIA] We can figure all this
out after we've gone home.

309
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,375
[JOSEPH] How can you
say that so blithely?

310
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,958
In your hour of tribulation,

311
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,458
I wasn't able to free
you from your bondage!

312
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:12,041
Lady Maria. Leave me sitting
in this church, I beg of you.

313
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,958
In light of my failings, such
abandonment is all I deserve--

314
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:14,916
[MARIA]
Shut up!

315
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,333
[ARTEMIS]
Yes, thank you!

316
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,208
[JOSEPH grunts]

317
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,833
What is wrong with you?!

318
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,791
All this whimpering
is insufferable!

319
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:24,250
"O happy day! I won!
All is well!"

320
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,958
That's all you needed to say!

321
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,750
Why do you insist on taking
the whip to your own back?

322
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:29,916
[JOSEPH]
Milady, I.

323
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,291
Come on, Joseph! Spit it out!

324
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,833
Never mind...

325
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,083
[MARIA groans] You've got a
lot of nerve, going off to war.

326
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,916
Risking your life while I
was powerless to save it!

327
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,958
My duty is to my liege lord,
Le Comte Guillaume.

328
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,208
He ordered me hither, so I went.

329
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,791
Wait. Why did you come here,

330
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,833
instead of returning to
the safety of the woods?

331
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,375
[MARIA growls]
Because you needed rescuing,

332
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,666
you doe-eyed simpleton!

333
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,583
[JOSEPH]
But I... I'm no one.

334
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,916
Well, you're someone
to me, all right?

335
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,458
If you want to
beg my pardon,

336
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,416
how about for putting that
dusty Count Guillaume

337
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,750
ahead of me all the time?

338
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,958
Just once, why not do
what you want to do, huh?

339
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,208
How?!

340
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,083
You are the master of
your own fate, Milady.

341
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:11,000
But one such as I, I lack the
magic and force of will

342
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,375
to do just as I want!

343
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,625
Huh? Magic has nothing
to do with this!

344
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,416
All you need to do is
follow your heart!

345
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,416
You think...
I didn't want to?

346
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,416
It slaughtered me
departing for battle,

347
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,250
knowing all the while they'd
locked you in a damned cage!

348
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,208
[MARIA] The past is dead and
gone, Joseph! Follow it now!

349
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,708
[JOSEPH]
I'm not at liberty to do that!

350
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,625
--[MARIA] Yes, you are!
--[JOSEPH] Tell me how!

351
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,541
[MARIA]
Just stay with me!

352
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,458
[gasps]

353
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,916
Stay with me, Joseph! Be my
bulwark, and my comfort!

354
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,166
Please, I need you.

355
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,666
[MARIA]
I'm not some force of nature!

356
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,125
I fall prey to doubt,
and regret, and fear!

357
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,958
I lose sight of who I am and
second-guess my actions

358
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,708
again and again, with
no answer to be found!

359
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,166
That doubt disappears every
time you but look at me!

360
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,500
It melts clean away!

361
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,375
Stay with me!
Now and always!

362
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,666
[PRIAPUS]
Um...

363
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,333
[ARTEMIS]
Maria?

364
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,833
[MARIA]
What?

365
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,375
[PRIAPUS] I could be wrong,
but it sure sounded like...

366
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:05,750
[ARTEMIS]
...you were proposing.

367
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:06,666
[MARIA]
Huh?

368
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,916
[JOSEPH]
I... I'm sorry, Milady.

369
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,541
Uh. My mouth outpaced my brain.

370
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,083
Hearing you speak with
such resolve all the time.

371
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,625
It's easy to forget that a very
fragile heart beats within you.

372
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,583
Would that I were its bulwark.

373
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,000
Huh?

374
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,375
[JOSEPH] Yes. I know now what
I desire above all else.

375
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:28,916
In truth, there was never
a time when I did not.

376
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,125
No matter how dire
the hardship.

377
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:35,958
I will face it with courage
if you are beside me.

378
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,208
I love you with all of my heart.

379
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,833
Please, marry me, Maria.

380
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:44,625
[MARIA laughs]

381
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,541
[ANN]
Uh?

382
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,208
[CERNUNNOS]
This feeling!

383
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,791
Wait. What?

384
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,916
[CERNUNNOS]
It's Maria!

385
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
"Magic dwelleth in
a steadfast heart."

386
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,833
She now lives the
truth of that tenet.

387
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,500
[ANN laughs]

388
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,333
Her magic's back,
and then some.

389
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,291
[GUILLAUME gasps]
What's going on?

390
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,208
[ENGLISH SOLDIER A] Our
weaponry! Damn it! Not again!

391
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,791
[CANNON BEARER CHIEF]
She's stealing the bombard!

392
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,000
Look! Isn't that Maria?

393
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,083
She's using her
magic so brazenly!

394
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,875
So, are my bruises gone?

395
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,833
Yes. [grunts]

396
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,333
[EDWINA chuckles]

397
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,000
[MARIA]
Everybody! Thank you all!

398
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,666
The French and
the British alike!

399
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,666
Every living thing
and souls departed.

400
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,291
I thank you from the
very bottom of my heart!

401
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,958
I couldn't have found
my way back without you!

402
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,708
Now, at last!
I found my happiness!

403
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,125
[PRIAPUS laughs]
Look at how happy she is.

404
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,708
[ARTEMIS]
Wait 'til she kisses him.

405
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,750
[MARIA laughs]

406
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,250
Archers! Shoot her
right out of the sky!

407
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,875
[FRENCH VASSAL A]
Our bows are aloft!

408
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,375
[GUILLAUME growls]

409
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,500
[MARIA] Everyone! Isn't it time
that we all returned home?

410
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,541
Come to me. Cauldron!

411
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,791
Those forgotten by men of the
new faith, here, shake off the

412
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,375
dust of bygone centuries, and
heed this witch of the hearth!

413
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:04,166
Arise, with tooth and claw, and
scatter these soldiers homeward!

414
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,833
[FRENCH SOLDIER A]
There's so many of them!

415
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,083
[FRENCH SOLDIER B]
Run for your lives!

416
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,250
[FRENCH SOLDIER C]
Don't look back!

417
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,375
[MARIA]
They'll only pose a threat

418
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,833
if you're fool enough to tarry.

419
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:30,291
You have my guarantee! The
witch Maria hates bloodshed!

420
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,000
Take my words to heart!

421
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,666
Now, go!

422
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,250
[JOSEPH yelps]

423
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:36,791
[ARTEMIS]
Maria!

424
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,000
[ALL gasp]

425
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,833
Why are we leaving here?

426
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,708
I need to give that brat
his comeuppance.

427
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:51,000
What'll ya do when he makes
a fright of your face again?

428
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,208
[GALFA] Who says
I lost to him, huh?

429
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,666
[LOLOTTE]
Any with eyes in their head.

430
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,250
[GALFA] 
I'll cut him to ribbons!

431
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,083
[LOLOTTE] 
Be still my heart!

432
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,791
[GALFA] 
Saucy harlot!

433
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:00,333
[JOSEPH]
Lady Maria!

434
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,833
Just Maria!

435
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:06,083
A slip of the tongue.
So where are we going?

436
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,708
I'm being summoned
for a tête-à-tête.

437
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,125
Good day to you,
Michael! Look!

438
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:21,708
I guess the two of
us are paramours!

439
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,666
[OLD ANN]
Her name was Maria.

440
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,708
The same as the Blessed Mother,

441
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:04,708
and just like her
holiest of namesakes.
