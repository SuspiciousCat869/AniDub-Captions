00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,833
[ANN] My story is set
in the olden days,

2
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:27,333
when we of France were
still at war with England.

3
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,916
There was a young witch
living near our village,

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,666
who hated wars with every
beat of her fiery heart.

5
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,750
Her name was Maria.

6
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,625
The same as the Blessed Mother,

7
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,333
and just like her
holiest of namesakes.

8
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,541
Maria was a virgin.

9
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,625
[MICHAEL]
The die is cast.

10
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,000
Her actions have led
her to this moment.

11
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,250
[MARIA gasps]

12
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:53,333
Maria!

13
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,708
You will unhand her!

14
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,500
If you don't, your head is next!

15
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,000
[MICHAEL]
Child of God,

16
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,291
your bolts are but
feathers to me.

17
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,333
You picked a bad
time to be brave.

18
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,666
Why do you think he's
glowing like that?

19
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,208
He's the Archangel Michael.

20
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,125
[ANN]
Huh?

21
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,416
Archangel Michael?

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,166
You're the Archangel?

23
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,500
[JOSEPH, ANN gasp]

24
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,833
[MICHAEL] You fired in haste,
not knowing who I was.

25
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,875
Forgive him his violence
against your messenger, Lord.

26
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,625
[MICHAEL]
Tell me, mortal.

27
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,875
Why defend this witch who
flouts the will of Heaven?

28
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,583
Maria saved everybody!

29
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,416
So please, don't do
anything bad to her!

30
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,458
She makes medicine
for my grandmother,

31
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,625
and protected Papa when
he went away to war!

32
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,250
Please, Saint Michael!

33
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,708
I should be dead, but she
brought an end to the carnage!

34
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:27,166
Many yet live because
Maria intervened!

35
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,458
[MICHAEL] She has meddled
with the world's balance,

36
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,750
and for that, the witch
Maria must be punished.

37
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,000
[JOSEPH]
Truly?

38
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,250
Then that is the will of Heaven?

39
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,583
[ARTEMIS, PRIAPUS gasp]

40
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,833
Stop it already!
Take the girl and run away!

41
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:46,958
[JOSEPH]
Very well.

42
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,291
[MARIA gasps]

43
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,625
[JOSEPH] Then, devil
take the will of Heaven!

44
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,125
Jesus said to
love thy neighbor.

45
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,291
I swear to you,
with God as my witness!

46
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,583
That I do love
the witch, Maria!

47
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,458
[MARIA gasps]

48
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:05,500
[bells ring]

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,958
[ANN]
Huh?

50
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,791
Blessings, in the
guise of rain fall upon

51
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,416
the devout and damnéd alike.

52
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,166
Almighty God has
rendered His judgment.

53
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,208
This creature of iniquity
shall keep her life.

54
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,250
[JOSEPH, ANN sigh]

55
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,375
[MICHAEL] In exchange,
you are banned henceforth

56
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,166
from practicing
significant magic

57
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,208
in the presence of the masses.

58
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:36,541
Also, whenever you
surrender your virginity

59
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,708
your sins shall be atoned
for in that moment,

60
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,916
by the loss of your
powers evermore.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,291
[MARIA]
Huh?!

62
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,541
[MICHAEL]
Ezekiel, come forth.

63
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,541
[ANN screams]

64
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,041
[MICHAEL]
Behold. Ezekiel.

65
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,416
My all-seeing proxy.

66
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,041
Tread you carefully.

67
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,458
For now your own
happiness is the coin

68
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,500
by which that of others
can be ransomed.

69
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,833
--[ANN] Maria!
--[JOSEPH] Lady Maria!

70
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,291
[ANN]
Hey, are you all right?

71
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,500
I'm fine, thank you, Ann.

72
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,625
What happened to
those mercenaries?

73
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,333
Oh. We handed them--

74
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,666
We handed them over
to Lord Prevot.

75
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,833
The village is safe again.

76
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,791
C'est bon. It's all so hazy.

77
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,875
What did Michael drone on about?

78
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,208
[EZEKIEL]
You should have paid attention.

79
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,125
His terms were simple.

80
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,208
[ANN]
What a cutie!

81
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,166
[MARIA]
And you are?

82
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,500
[PRIAPUS]
Her name's Ezekiel.

83
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,791
[ARTEMIS]
I guess this is her usual form.

84
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,208
Listen carefully, witch,
for I shall only say this once.

85
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,000
Michael hath decreed.

86
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,208
Your days of halting
battles on a whim are over.

87
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,083
If you wish to use
your magic thus,

88
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,708
you must do it at the
cost of your own pleasure.

89
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:07,583
One or the other.
It's only fair.

90
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,708
[MARIA gasps]

91
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,041
Wait a damn minute!
You're telling me,

92
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,083
I lose my magic as soon
as I've lost you-know-what?!

93
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,416
[EZEKIEL]
Virginity. That's right.

94
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
[MARIA]
No!

95
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,625
If that's the case,
then I'm doomed!

96
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:22,208
I will die an old maid, having
never known the love of a man!

97
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,208
[JOSEPH]
Uh, Lady Maria.

98
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,375
--[MARIA yelps]
--[ANN] Huh?

99
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,541
Shouting about private
matters like that.

100
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,166
I can't say I'm surprised.

101
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,916
OW! Hey, what was that-- Aah!

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,208
How dare you treat
me so outrageously?

103
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,666
I am Saint Michael's trusted--

104
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,041
[JOSEPH]
I swear to you.

105
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,333
That I do love
the witch, Maria!

106
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,833
[MARIA gasps]

107
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,041
All right! That's enough!

108
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,833
I want the three of
you to get along!

109
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,833
Master, we're birds of prey.

110
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,041
Yeah, well it's all Michael's

111
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,458
fault for saddling you
with a stupid dove.

112
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,500
This place is a madhouse! Go!

113
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,916
Lose your virginity already, so
I can go back to where I belong!

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,916
Hey, it's my virginity!

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,208
And why is it tied to
the loss of my magic?

116
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,791
Don't forget the rest of it.

117
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,333
Dare to use your powers in
public and Saint Michael's

118
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,375
spear will strike
you where you stand.

119
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,833
Many have tried
to dodge it--

120
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:07,708
[ARTEMIS, PRIAPUS yell]

121
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:08,916
[EZEKIEL]
Hey! Stop it!

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,458
[PRIAPUS] Sorry, Master.
I couldn't help it.

123
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,625
I know you told us to get along,
but she's really vexing me!

124
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:16,333
[mummbled arguing]

125
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,083
I've a hunch that my human form

126
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,916
could teach yours
a thing or two.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,583
I could teach you
a thing or two,

128
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,875
if only I had a thing
with which to teach.

129
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:24,708
[EZEKIEL]
What?

130
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,291
Oh, just leave her alone.

131
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,541
I think you should be getting
more than your fill at night.

132
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,000
[PRIAPUS]
Really? Who have I filled?

133
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,666
Oh, please.
You'll get your shot!

134
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,333
If I look down and
see nothingness

135
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,041
one more time, I'll go crazy!

136
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,291
--I need it, okay? I need penis!
--[MARIA yells]

137
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,166
[PRIAPUS] I know you know
what they look like now!

138
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,083
There was that one last night!
Gods, it was monstrous!

139
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,541
Like that serpent you summoned!

140
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,541
Oh, shut up!

141
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,416
Mon Dieu.

142
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,583
You take that maypole in all its

143
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,625
meaty glory and put
it on me right now--

144
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,916
[PRIAPUS groans]

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,500
[MARIA]
Get to the hearth and whip up a

146
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,375
thank-you meal for Ann
and Joseph already!

147
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,958
So, then, there is
truth to the rumors.

148
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,791
By the Blesséd Mother.

149
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:10,250
When next she appears,
I must tell Brother Bernard.

150
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,958
[PRIAPUS]
All right. The food's ready.

151
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,791
[ANN]
We have to say grace!

152
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,166
[JOSEPH]
Let us pray.

153
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,458
[JOSEPH, ANN] Bless us,
O Lord, and these Thy gifts,

154
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,000
which we are about
to receive from

155
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:26,875
your bounty through
Christ our Lord. Amen.

156
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,583
[JOSEPH, ANN]
In the name of the Father,

157
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,208
and of the Son, and
of the Holy Spirit.

158
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,625
Amen.

159
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,375
[JOSEPH]
Ah, sorry.

160
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,250
Just something we
do before we eat.

161
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:37,833
[EZEKIEL snickers]

162
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,250
[MARIA]
Hmph.

163
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,458
[ANN]
Say, Maria?

164
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,291
[MARIA]
Hm?

165
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,291
[ANN]
Are you a heretic?

166
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:42,833
[MARIA]
Huh?

167
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:43,916
[ARTEMIS laughs]

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,375
Master's as heretical
as they come.

169
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,291
The bishop told
us about them.

170
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:52,000
He said that they're really
naughty, and not to become one.

171
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,916
He said that if a
girl has short hair,

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,083
or goes around with
her legs uncovered,

173
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,791
she's definitely a heretic.

174
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,250
Anything you want
to tell us, Ezekiel?

175
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,250
I rank among the
angels of Heaven.

176
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,791
Your rules have no bearing
whatsoever on my attire.

177
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,250
[ANN] If Maria goes to town,
would they be mean?

178
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,041
They'd give her a warm welcome.

179
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,625
One with a stake.

180
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,916
Let them judge me.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,833
I am the master of my own fate.

182
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:15,750
No, you're not.

183
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,041
[MARIA growls]

184
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,041
Looking like that,
they'd set you on fire next.

185
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,833
No human can lay
a finger on me.

186
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,333
I have powers from Heaven
that would keep me safe.

187
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,083
All right!

188
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,666
Use them to stop the war then.

189
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,458
[EZEKIEL]
Huh?

190
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,916
You're not a witch.

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,291
Do it with the power of Heaven,
and all should be well.

192
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,000
If the bloodshed is
brought to an end,

193
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,666
I don't much care by
whose hand it happens.

194
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,916
[EZEKIEL sighs]

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,541
It's true we keep watch
over the deeds of mankind,

196
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,083
but not for reasons
of intervention.

197
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,541
[JOSEPH]
Lady Ezekiel.

198
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,541
I am young, it's true,

199
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,125
but I have never known
a France without war.

200
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,833
My elders speak of peace,
but to one such as I,

201
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,375
it may as well be a fairy-tale.

202
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,125
I had hoped that
our woes might move

203
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,875
the heavens to pity,
but I guess I was wrong.

204
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,000
So be it.

205
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,666
But at the least,
grant us something.

206
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,000
A sign of some kind,
to salve our pain.

207
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,208
Have faith.

208
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,416
I do.

209
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,458
In Lady Maria.

210
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,500
You tell me she's
at odds with God,

211
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,166
but I see nothing in her deeds
worthy of this angelic censure.

212
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,750
[MARIA]
Hmph.

213
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,750
Let it be.

214
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,666
It's not her call to make.

215
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,333
Michael has spoken.

216
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,375
[EZEKIEL, MARIA grunt]

217
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,708
[MARTHA]
Saint Michael did that to Maria?

218
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,375
She's safe now,
though, right, Ann?

219
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,541
[ANN]
Uh-huh.

220
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,958
She looked fine after
we ate something.

221
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,000
Here. This is for you.
Maria said to make a tea of it,

222
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,500
if you still hurt from
when you fell down.

223
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,666
Well, thank you.

224
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,041
[ANN]
Hey, Grandmother?

225
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,208
Yes, dear?

226
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,416
Maybe she's a heretic,
but I like her a lot.

227
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,708
[FRENCH CAPTAIN] Steel
your hearts, men of France!

228
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,041
Hit them so hard,

229
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,375
the survivors swim back
to their damnable island!

230
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,708
[YVAIN]
Hear that, brothers?

231
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,291
There's coin to be had!

232
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,250
[FRENCH SOLDIERS cheer]

233
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,666
Those puny Brit bastards

234
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,541
had better make it worth
my while to kill 'em!

235
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,166
[FRENCH CAPTAIN]
Genoese mercenaries, forward!

236
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,000
[ENGLISH CAPTAIN]
Here they come!

237
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,458
Keep them at bay!

238
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,916
[PRIAPUS]
There they go.

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,208
[ARTEMIS] I wonder how many of
them will see their home again.

240
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,083
[MARIA growls]

241
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,208
[EZEKIEL]
Easy, witch.

242
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,583
[MARIA gasps]

243
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,083
They have come to this
moment of their own accord.

244
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,083
Thus, it is not your place
to alter the outcome.

245
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,458
Who said I was going
to interfere, huh?

246
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,166
What other reason could
have compelled you hither?

247
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,875
[MARIA grunts]

248
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,541
Many will die here, yes,

249
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,250
but the devout will know
the peace of Heaven.

250
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,708
[MARIA]
Shut up.

251
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,708
[GALFA]
All right! Time to hunt!

252
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,666
[ENGLISH ARCHER groans]

253
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,958
[MARIA]
I get it now.

254
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,541
[EZEKIEL]
Huh?

255
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,583
[MARIA] The Heavenly Host leaves
the world to its own devices.

256
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,666
Come, men! Onward!

257
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,291
[MARIA] I live in the world,
so by your own logic,

258
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,291
whatever I do here
should be allowed!

259
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,541
[FRENCH CAPTAIN]
Montjoie Saint Denis!

260
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,791
Ezekiel! I must!

261
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,833
[EZEKIEL] No. Let us away.
What follows is not pretty.

262
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,208
[MARIA]
I can't stand this!

263
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,625
Is Michael staring down
at me day and night?

264
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,750
[EZEKIEL]
Heavens, no.

265
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,541
Did you really
think that he was?

266
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,708
[MARIA]
Huh?

267
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,833
Michael is an angel
of the highest rank.

268
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,625
He can't possibly watch
you every single second.

269
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,750
[MARIA]
You don't say.

270
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,708
Why do you think
you're stuck with me?

271
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,375
Now, come along.

272
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,083
[EZEKIEL]
Huh?

273
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:46,041
[screams]

274
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,916
[ENGLISH SOLDIER A]
What's that?

275
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,541
[SOLDIERS scream]

276
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,125
[TARASQUE roars]

277
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,541
[ENGLISH SOLDIER B]
It's a monster!

278
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,916
[ENGLISH SOLDIER C] Did
France's witch call it forth?

279
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,458
[ENGLISH SOLDIER D]
Who cares? Run for your lives!

280
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,833
[FRENCH CAPTAIN] Curse that
witch for stealing our victory!

281
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,291
Retreat!

282
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,875
What do you think
you're doing?!

283
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,250
I guess you were facing
the other direction.

284
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,041
That popped up from nowhere.

285
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,833
You don't think it was Michael
who summoned it, do you?

286
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,916
[EZEKIEL]
She truly means to fool me

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,500
with such a threadbare lie?

288
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,875
[TARASQUE roars]

289
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:14,708
[GALFA grunts]

290
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,000
[YVAIN]
Pull back, Galfa!

291
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,041
Its crap will burn
you to cinders!

292
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,583
Foiled again?

293
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,416
That damned witch is protecting
me right into the poorhouse!

294
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,083
The witch n'est pas?

295
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,541
[GILBERT]
Yes.

296
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,166
I received word she appeared
on the battlefield again.

297
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,083
[BERNARD]
Hm.

298
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,041
[GILBERT]
What shall we do?

299
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,916
Her deeds have left her
much on the people's

300
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,333
lips as of late. They look
to the Church for judgment,

301
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,583
good or ill.

302
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,541
May God the father
carry you and keep you.

303
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,583
Bless you, Frere Bernard.

304
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,791
[GILBERT] You have guided
them to the Lord so tirelessly

305
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,458
in word and deed, and now
she leads them astray.

306
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,833
[BERNARD]
The sorceress.

307
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,375
[GILBERT]
Oui.

308
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,333
[BERNARD] She has meddled in
the affairs of man yet again?

309
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,375
[GILBERT]
Yes, and before she fled,

310
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,708
the heavens themselves
rebuked her.

311
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:06,125
The Archangel Michael punished
the witch by his own hand.

312
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,125
[BERNARD]
Tell me, Lord.

313
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,291
[GILBERT]
Huh?

314
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,083
[BERNARD]
What does she want to achieve?

315
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,541
[GILBERT]
Sorry.

316
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,916
[BERNARD]
Let us confer with this witch.

317
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,791
This, Maria.

318
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:26,250
[VILLAGERS chattering]

319
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,291
[JOSEPH]
I'm sorry, milady.

320
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,166
Your usual garb
is a bit arresting.

321
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,416
It's fine.

322
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,166
Besides, I'm not looking
to cause any trouble.

323
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,458
Either way, you
have my thanks.

324
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,250
Well, thanking me
for just having

325
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,541
a brain in my head is silly.

326
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,583
So, why does this
monk want to meet me?

327
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,333
[JOSEPH]
I was merely bid to fetch you.

328
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,875
He gave no voice to his
reasons for the meeting.

329
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,833
I still can't believe
a man who's taken

330
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:55,041
the cassock and tonsure
would call upon a witch.

331
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,250
[JOSEPH]
Fear not, milady.

332
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,041
He seems a man
of great serenity.

333
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,083
I doubt very much
any danger awaits you,

334
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:05,375
but if any mean you harm
I shall be your bulwark.

335
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,750
So then, are you on my side?

336
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:16,250
Keep in mind. I nearly
shot Saint Michael twice.

337
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,500
[VILLAGERS murmur]

338
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,125
[squeels]

339
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,208
[MARIA]
What's this?

340
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,833
[JOSEPH] They're trying that hog
for trampling a girl to death.

341
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,125
For the crime of murder,

342
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,750
this beast has been
brought here to judgment.

343
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,250
Now, the court will render
the justice of the Lord

344
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,458
upon this creature.

345
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,000
[squeeling]

346
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,250
[JUDGE] It shall hang
by the neck until dead!

347
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,625
[VILLAGERS cheer]

348
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,958
Come on! It didn't know!

349
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,958
Yes, but it killed a girl.

350
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,416
Hey, Joseph!

351
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,750
[JOSEPH]
Galfa!

352
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,541
Glad to see you got
yourself a friend.

353
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,416
I was just escorting
her to an acquaintance.

354
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,333
Mademoiselle.

355
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,583
Enchanté.

356
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,416
You talk like you got a
stick up your backside.

357
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,708
[JOSEPH gasps] I take it you've
been to the tavern, Galfa?

358
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:08,291
[GALFA] Damn right I was!
At least Maria lets me do that!

359
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,166
[JOSEPH, MARIA gasp]

360
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,375
Damn it all!

361
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,333
I wish she'd let us
have a proper battle.

362
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,083
Right now I'm as useless
as teats on a bull!

363
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,083
I can still think of a couple
good uses for you Galfa.

364
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,500
Excuse us.

365
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:23,208
I'm afraid we must be going,
Until we meet again.

366
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,458
[GALFA]
Yeah, later.

367
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,166
Hey, you in the cloak!

368
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,708
[GALFA chuckles]
Could ya do us all a favor

369
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,541
and chop down
Joseph's tree, huh?

370
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,166
[JOSEPH gasps]
Bite your tongue!

371
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,416
[laughing]
Have fun!

372
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,708
Sorry. I can't go further,

373
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,291
but he's waiting just ahead.

374
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,958
[MARIA]
Huh? Oh, right. Frere Bernard.

375
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,750
Pleased to meet you.

376
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,458
I bid you welcome
to our monastery.

377
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,958
Frere Bernard.

378
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,250
Maria's the name. I'm the witch.

379
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,500
[EZEKIEL]
And I.

380
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,541
[MARIA] Hush, this is
already weird enough.

381
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,708
[EZEKIEL scoffs]
Rude.

382
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,041
[BERNARD] Yours is
the most holy of names.

383
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,708
May I ask you gave it to you?

384
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:09,791
[MARIA]
Couldn't say.

385
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,500
I've just always
answered to Maria.

386
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,708
[BERNARD]
Whoever chose it,

387
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,583
they must have seen
you baptized as a child.

388
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:17,916
Is that so?

389
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,916
You are a very curious monk.

390
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,250
Some innocent questions
till they're not.

391
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,416
I would make a poor inquisitor.

392
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,541
No.

393
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,458
I ask you this for
a different reason.

394
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,916
[MARIA]
Hm?

395
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,208
[BERNARD]
Maria,

396
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,583
this apple cider was
pressed at our monastery.

397
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,250
Apple cider?

398
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,625
[BERNARD]
Please. Enjoy.

399
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,208
Fear not.

400
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,250
I do not deal in treachery.

401
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,333
[MARIA]
Look, Bernard.

402
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,208
That was your name, wasn't it?

403
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,583
You didn't call me
here for the cider.

404
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,708
It would be honored to serve
as your confessor, Maria.

405
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,708
Your soul is a pearl
of great worth.

406
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,916
[MARIA]
Huh?

407
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,166
[BERNARD] Your name
befits a servant of God,

408
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,083
not a renouncement of faith.

409
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,333
[MARIA]
Are you kidding?

410
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,541
Listen. Listen well.

411
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,541
Your actions are deviant, true,

412
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,250
but the common people
hold you in high esteem.

413
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,958
Better to absolve your sins
and bring you into the fold.

414
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:18,333
Frankly, magic spits
in the eye of God.

415
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,958
Repent, your wicked ways,

416
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,416
and you may walk arm-in-arm
with Heaven's righteous elect.

417
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:30,125
The Church will bid you welcome.
Your past is forgiven.

418
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,916
[MARIA] And what do I
get out of this pageant?

419
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,708
[BERNARD] A soul illumined
by the Lord's perfection,

420
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,166
for all time.

421
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,500
[MARIA]
That seems fair enough.

422
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,333
And what do you get out of this?

423
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,375
[BERNARD] By the worldly sense
of the word, we gain nothing.

424
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:47,125
Just the joy of having
found a new sister in Christ.

425
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,375
Do it, Maria.
There's no need to hesitate.

426
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,833
Right you are.

427
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,166
[gasps]

428
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:57,916
[GILBERT gasps]

429
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,958
[MARIA]
I am a witch.

430
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,583
I have no need of
your Heaven or Church.

431
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,625
I'll pass on your cider, too.

432
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,958
[MARIA] Give my
regards to your Maria.

433
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:14,791
[BERNARD]
Gilbert.

434
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:15,833
[GILBERT]
Yes.

435
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,416
[BERNARD]
Please notify the Abbé

436
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,875
that I am in sore
need of confession.

437
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,458
[GILBERT]
You have done nothing.

438
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,083
[BERNARD]
On the contrary.

439
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,583
I have spoken to a witch.

440
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,708
Ego te absolvo.

441
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,208
Wicked Maria.

442
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,750
I absolve you of sin.

443
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,125
[JOSEPH]
Milady. How did it go?

444
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,208
[MARIA]
All right.

445
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,125
It was really nothing
of consequence.

446
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,208
That was your chance
back there, you know.

447
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,083
I don't recall asking for one.

448
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,625
My soul is my own.

449
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,041
It doesn't need saving
by that man back there,

450
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,625
or his Church, or anyone!

451
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:57,041
No! That's final!

452
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,458
[BERNARD] What is
a beehive, if not utopia?

453
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,208
All know their place.
The queen, ascendant.

454
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,375
The workers, busy. Honest toil.

455
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,833
There is beauty in their
ordered lives, Gilbert.

456
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,166
Each hive is a living parable.

457
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,416
Beg pardon. What of the witch?

458
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,083
Patience, my young friend.

459
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,625
[GILBERT]
Huh?

460
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,125
[BERNARD] Pressing honey from
the comb is a slow process.

461
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,208
For now at least,
if she wants to toil

462
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:24,625
on behalf of the god-fearing,
I say we leave her to her work.

463
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:28,458
And if she tries to
sting us. Well...

464
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,791
[GILBERT]
Oh.

465
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,291
You believe my words
betray a worldly heart.

466
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,541
It's in your voice.

467
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,583
No! You're making plans
to defend your flock!

468
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,916
Any good shepherd
would do the same!

469
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,041
Who would dare
condemn you for that?

470
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,583
[BERNARD]
Merci, Gilbert.

471
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,708
Your words are
my balm of Gilead.

472
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,625
[EZEKIEL] He didn't
seem like a bad man.

473
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,666
Why not speak to that
Bernard fellow again?

474
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,375
[MARIA]
Because I don't want to.

475
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,666
If that's such a problem,
go back to Michael.

476
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,916
I'm not going anywhere! Ugh!

477
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,541
[DEEP VOICE]
Sorceress.

478
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,000
[MARIA]
Who's there?

479
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,791
[DEEP VOICE] "Who" and "what"
hold no meaning for me,

480
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:13,666
but lips long-dead
called me Cernunnos.

481
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,541
[MARIA gasps]

482
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,208
[CERNUNNOS]
Tell me, Maria.

483
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,791
The things you do,
what end do they serve?

484
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,125
[MARIA] The same
tired question, huh?

485
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,375
[MARIA] When I see something
I don't like happening

486
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,875
in front of me,
I can't let it go.

487
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,041
[CERNUNNOS] Humanity cannot
exist without conflict.

488
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,791
Their fleeting lives demand it.

489
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,416
Even if you
change the world,

490
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,916
it won't be calm for long.
They will die.

491
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,208
[MARIA gasps]

492
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,875
[CERNUNNOS]
The young will take their place,

493
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:48,000
and strife will weave its
way back into the world.

494
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,500
The circle cannot be broken.

495
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,541
[MARIA]
Maybe not!

496
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,875
But unless you try,
who even knows?

497
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,416
[CERNUNNOS]
Understand, witch.

498
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,916
I will do nothing to stop you.

499
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,125
For one such as I,
the outcome matters little.

500
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,083
The eyes of Cernunnos
will be on you,

501
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,041
Maria.

502
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,500
Wait don't go!

503
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,333
Dirty. Oh, so dirty.

504
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,833
You're still a
virgin aren't ya?

505
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,875
Time you were rid of
that pesky virginity.

506
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,416
[MARIA gasps]
Today?

507
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,250
[PRIAPUS screams]
