00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,250
[ANN] My story is set
in the olden days,

2
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,625
when we of France were
still at war with England.

3
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,250
There was a young witch
living near our village,

4
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:34,458
who hated wars with every
beat of her fiery heart.

5
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,416
Her name was Maria.

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,333
The same as the Blessed Mother,

7
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,125
and just like her
holiest of namesakes.

8
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,333
Maria was a virgin.

9
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:24,833
[bells ringing]

00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,958
[FARMER A, MERCENARY A grunt]

11
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,000
Lay down, coward!

12
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,208
Jamais!

13
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,833
If you keep coming,
we'll kill you all!

14
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:35,833
[MERCENARY C]
What did you say?

15
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,791
[MERCENARY D]
Die, you peasant!

16
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,958
[MERCENARY CAPTAIN]
By order of Count Villandrando.

17
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,375
I command you peasants
to lay down arms!

18
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,541
Surrender and you
may yet see the dawn!

19
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,083
The Devil can take your count!

20
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,958
You'll have only
more corpses from us!

21
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,541
Let L'ecorceur win
his gold in battle!

Even with no war to fight,

00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,333
[MERCENARY E]
If we had a real fight,

26
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,541
we'd waste no time
on your petty village.

27
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,750
[MERCENARY F]
Blame that witch!

28
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,041
She's the one stopping it!

29
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,041
[MERCENARY G]
Then again,

30
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,416
there're things
worth taking here

31
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,125
what you can't find
on no battlefield!

[EZEKIEL] Hey! I can't
see what's happening!

43
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,750
Priapus! What are you doing?
Let go of my face!

44
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,625
Don't you do it!
Just hold on tight.

45
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,250
It'd be my pleasure.
And speaking of my pleasure,

46
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,708
could we do something
about my lack thereof?

47
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,000
We will. Keep your pants on.

48
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,208
There's no risk of my
taking them off right now!

49
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,541
Not with my dreadful lack!

[MARIA]
Later, Priapus!

55
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,000
What new foolishness now?

56
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,125
It's hard to say.

57
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,166
[BERNARD]
Je vois.

58
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,583
So, that forest is
the heart of it?

59
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,833
[GILBERT]
Oui.

60
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,333
So say the villagers all
around the monastery.

61
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,500
They claim to have seen
Maria flying into the fray.

62
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,125
She continues to
summon creatures

63
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:19,083
against French and
English soldiers alike.

64
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,833
They say she recently drove

65
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,875
Rodrigo de Villandrando's
routiers out of a village.

66
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,333
She never takes a
moment's respite, does she?

67
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,583
Not a one.

68
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,333
And there are rumors of
the Archangel Michael

69
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,541
descending upon a village
where she appeared.

70
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,916
Do you believe she is trying
to carve out her own realm,

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,166
Brother Bernard?

72
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,250
[BERNARD]
I cannot yet say.

73
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:07,583
[panting]

74
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,083
[EZEKIEL]
How dare you fly off without me?

75
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,500
Moreover, how oft must
I say that you are

76
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,541
forbidden from using magic
in battle and before others?

77
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,791
[MARIA]
Yeah.

78
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,666
I found this odd stick
in the village green.

79
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,583
Whaddaya think it could be?

80
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,166
Some new weapon?

81
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,791
[EZEKIEL] Hey! I am
still admonishing you!

82
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,375
I am a Messenger
of the Lord,

83
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,166

84
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,041

And it continues.

Ah, welcome back, Artemis.

There's not one muscle in
my body that doesn't ache.

89

At least I can promise there'll
be no war in the east today.

90
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,041
What's new?

91
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,500
[PRIAPUS] A rout of sell-swords
attacked the village,

92
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,833
Maria did her magic
and chased them off.

93
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,708
The real problem is Ezekiel.

94
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,625
[EZEKIEL] Are you
even listening, Maria?

95
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,333
Do you think I am
blind just because

96
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,083
you order that runt
to cover my eyes?

97
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,666
She's been going at it
like that since you left.

Welcome back.

108
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,416
Maybe she'll listen to you,
for she's certainly not

109
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,041
listening to the
voice of reason!

A weapon of such spite

118
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,583
could throw the whole
world into chaos.

119
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,250
It's already in chaos,
all because of you!

Saint Michael will hear of it!

[ARTEMIS]
Ah, that reminds me.

124
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,541

her innocent familiars?

126

I cannot say for sure.

127
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,458
More than likely
you would revert

128
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,166
to your original forms
without a witch to enchant you.

129
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,541
Well, that seems
rather boring, doesn't it?

130
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,041
I like having
this body, thank you.

made your acquaintance.

Great. Another.

138

I think she's a witch
from across the Channel.

Is there something
I can do for you?

140

[VIV] I stand before you to
present a formal complaint.

are causing more

149
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,250
Really, all we're asking is that

150
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,041
you leave the
battles to us, agreed?

England squabble over

who's sitting on
what throne and where,

154
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,458
and we witches can
make a tidy fortune.

155
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,958
Oh! Here's a thought!

156
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,125
Why don't you consider joining
our little confederation?

157
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,750
I can put in a few good
words on your behalf.

158
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,500
Everyone knows you're
something special, Maria.

159
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,625
It seems they're all the same,

160
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,541
no matter where they hail from.

161
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,500
And why would I want that?

162
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,750
[VIV]
Huh?

163
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,500
[MARIA] I have no
interest in money at all.

164
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:11,208
I just want to help these
people live in peace.

165
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,666
Honestly?

166
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes, of course! This land
has suffered enough already!

167
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,250
It's time the fighting
came to an end.

168
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,708
I will not stay my hand
until the armies do.

169
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,208
You're serious?

170
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,958
Are you touched in the head?

171
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:25,833
What?

172
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,291
If you get your stupid peace,

173
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,166
how will those bloody
soldiers earn a living?

174
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,250
I guess they can all just learn
how to tend a farm or something!

175
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,333
That's an honest trade.

176
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,833
That's a lovely
fantasy you have,

177
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,541
but quite far from the truth.

178
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,750
You don't have to act like

179
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,500
your holy namesake
with me, you know?

180
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,291
[grunts]

181
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,750
If the wars suddenly end,

182
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,458
witches and soldiers both
will lose their livelihood.

183
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,958
Villandrando's mercenaries
only started looting

184
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,791
because there were no
real battles to fight.

185
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,958
Your code of honor is
just an excuse to shove

186
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,125
your own cock-eyed
beliefs onto everybody else!

187
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,791
Besides, if you and yours
keep barging into these fights,

188
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,166
Heaven is gonna come
down hard on you!

189
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,083
[gasps]

190
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,625
That's the truth.

191
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,041
Saint Michael already told her

192
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,666
what would happen if
she lost her virginity.

193
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,125
Hold on here.

194
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,291
[laughing]

195
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,041
You mean to tell me that
you're actually still a maid?

196
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,416
Truly? I simply
cannot believe it!

197
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,416
Don't you have
somewhere else to be?

198
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,125
In any case, this works
out rather well for us.

199
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,541
Time we were rid of
that pesky virginity.

200
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,833
What? Like, now?

201
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,041
It's brilliant!

202
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,875
Oh, you're in for a
hell of a time, Maria!

203
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,916
But I, this is, I mean,
this is all so out of the blue.

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,458
Don't worry about a thing!

205
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,083
I swear! There's no joy
sweeter in this life

206
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,791
than taking a
man to your bed.

207
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,625
Hey! Too close! Too tight!

208
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,500
Claiming a man who
fits you perfectly

209
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,583
has its own kind of magic.
Surely you would agree.

210
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,791
[ARTEMIS]
It's magical, I can't deny it.

211
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,208
And what say you,
who hails from Heaven above?

212
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,208
[gasps]

213
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,041
Truly there's no
pleasure on earth

214
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,833
greater than such
carnal abandon.

215
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,166
I refuse to answer.

216
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,125
'Tis unseemly of one such as I.

217
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,250
[MARIA]
Wha--?

218
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,333
Ezekiel!

219
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,125
I trusted you!
Even you know about--?

220
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,000
I wasn't blushing
because I know!

221
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,000
It's a filthy, unclean subject
and I'll have no part of it,

222
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:09,625
you hear me?

223
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,208
Right. Easy.

224
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,833
[VIV]
You know what?

225
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,666
You virgins are
such a boring lot.

226
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,083
Once they're finally abed,

227
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,833
they do naught
but shiver in fear,

228
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,166
mewling like a lost kitten.
As though they're ashamed

229
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,083
of having a little
fun now and again.

230
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,875
Is it true the first
time hurts a lot?

231
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,625
Sure, at first. So much you
fear you'll split in two.

232
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,875
But, if he sees to his duty...

233
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,500
[VIV] Like to know a
bit more, would you?

234
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,500
A-A little.

235
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,625
My mistress is
curious today.

236
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,833
Good! Then it's sorted.
I shall scare you up a lover!

237
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,291
[MARIA]
Huh? Y-You don't mean!

238
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,000
[VIV] You still want
to lose it, right?

239
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,666
Well, yeah, but...

240
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,166
I'll need to prepare.

241
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,208
So much to do, so little time.

242
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,791
It's all rather
complicated, you see.

243
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,083
Have it your way.

244
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,166
Then for today, let's have
you watch me at it.

245
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,666
I'll explain how everything
works as we go along.

246
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,375
Yeah?

247
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,875
[MARIA]
Yeah. Great.

248
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,250
Food's ready, everyone.

249
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,208
[VIV]
Uh?

250
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,291
[PRIAPUS gasps]

251
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,208
[VIV]
Ah! He's so cute! Is he yours?

252
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,833
He's my incubus, but he
hasn't quite, y'know.

253
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,500
Another virgin?

254
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,666
My lucky day. Come on!

255
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,750
[PRIAPUS]
Uh! Wait! Wait! I, um!

[MARIA gasps]

257
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,791
[VIV] Come, come, Maria,
we mustn't delay our work!

258
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,666
The fun part's coming up!

259
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,916
[PRIAPUS]
You don't understand!

260
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,958
Not there!

261
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,000
You're not going to--!

262
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,625
[PRIAPUS screams]

263
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,625
What kind of evil
witch are you?

264
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,958
Are you insane?

265
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,791
You left off the best part!

266
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,833
To be fair, I tried to warn you.

267
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,416
[PRIAPUS screams]

268
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,666
[VIV]
Heed me, virgin!

269
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,875
When I come back,
that boy best be complete.

270
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,333
And I mean really complete!

271
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,208
Wait a second. What do
you mean "come back"?

272
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,083
[VIV]
A three-legged stool!

273
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,583
Dirty. Oh so dirty!

274
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,458
Unclean, unclean, unclean,

275
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,583
--unclean, unclean.

[DRUNKARD laughs]
Those English bastards.

278
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,125
Thank ya, lad.

279
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,833
De rien.

280
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,333
[GALFA] Maria's causing
plenty of problems.

281
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,708
That girl don't know when to
leave well enough alone, right?

282
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,583
Huh.

283
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,458
[GALFA] If that witch won't
let us have a proper fight,

284
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,333
I think we'd best move on.

285
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,208
Looks like The captain's
over there haggling

286
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,875
with the noble for our payment.

287
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,666
So, we're marooned
in this backwater.

288
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,000
It's not so bad.

289
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,750
You'll have all your coin
back soon as I'm paid.

290
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,416
[JOSEPH]
No need. It's yours.

291
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,750
Huh?

292
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,791
[JOSEPH] If I need something,
I'll ask my Lord.

293
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,333
He's a generous man,
and glad to help.

294
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,708
I hope that coin can
help your comrades.

295
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,833
[scoffs]
Joseph,

296
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,166
you aren't cut out for
a soldier's lot in life.

297
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,291
Truly?

298
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,750
But, if you are just
givin' gold away,

299
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,333
I'll gladly take my share.

300
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,375
And on the topic of
takin' one's share.

301
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,791
You're still a virgin, aintcha.

302
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,166
[JOSEPH sputters]

303
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,500
Well! We can have
that cured in a trice.

304
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,750
We've a doxy at the camp

305
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,166
who will scratch
your itch right quick.

306
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,750
[JOSEPH]
Uh. You don't have to.

307
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,125
Why not? Think you're
too good for that type?

308
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,833
I meant no disrespect.
Uh, how do I put this?

309
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,083
There's this lady.

310
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,625
[GALFA] I get it,
yer lookin' to get unlaced

311
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,750
by that other girl, aren't ya?

312
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,666
No, but Mari--!

313
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,125
No. It would be
dishonorable to think of a lady

314
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,000
in such a position. You know?

315
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,041
[GALFA]
Hmm.

316
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,791
[GALFA]
I'm just a sell-sword.

317
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,000
That's what you think!

318
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,583
What I think, is maybe
you drank too much.

319
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,041
Shut up! Get offa me!

320
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,208
I don't need you to hold me up.

321
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,458
'Course not.

322
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,208
I'll pay it all back.
Every single coin.

323
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,958
I'm not talking
alms from you, boy!

324
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,916
Please, Galfa. I swear
that's not what I--!

325
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,791
[GALFA]
They're all I got to my name.

326
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,458
That's all gonna change,
you hear me?

327
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,708
Just you wait, Joseph.

328
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,916

I'm plantin' my sword in the

of my enemies,

and I'm climbin' that stinkin'
pile of corpses to the very top!

331
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,166
I'll get knighted!

332
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,541
Or made a noble!
They'll bow to me!

333
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,666
I'm gonna be king, you hear me?

334

An' to get that
crown on my head,

335
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,125
there ain't nothing I won't do!

336
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,541

some luck came my way?

Yes. Come on.

his rest, after all.

Well then.

Huh?

[JOSEPH] All I know is...
I want to be more.

348
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,333
Your code of honor,

349
00:14:56,416 --> 00:15:00,291
is an excuse to shove your
beliefs onto everybody else!

350
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,583
[MARIA]
Peace... War.

351
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,291
Ah, why?! It shouldn't
be like this!

352
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,625
What's wrong with simple peace!

353
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:11,833
Hey, Priapus!

354
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,208
[PRIAPUS]
Hm?

355
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,083
[MARIA] Bring this medicine
to Martha, understand?

356
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,250
As you wish.

357
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,041
Ezekiel, you should go with him.

358
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:18,750
[EZEKIEL]
What?

359
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:19,750
[MARIA]
Yeah.

360
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:20,916
Do the shopping
while you're out.

361
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,625
Do not seek to command
me like a servant!

362
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,833
[grunts, yells]

363
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,333
And grab us some fresh
eggs if you see any!

364
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,000
[PRIAPUS]
Got it!

365
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
[EZEKIEL] Why do I have
to go on the shopping trip?

366
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,041
[PRIAPUS] You're eating
at our table, aren't you?

367
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,750
I am a herald of the Lord
and you are a cook.

368
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,250
Can't you do this on
your own, Priapus?

369
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,416
[PRIAPUS] Maria needs some
alone time to think things over.

370
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,791
[EZEKIEL]
What things?

371
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,958
New ways in which to bedevil me?

372
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,291
[PRIAPUS grunts]

373
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,458
[EZEKIEL] Hey, isn't that
a village down there?

374
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,291
Let's stop and do
the stupid shopping.

375
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,291
[PRIAPUS]
Ezekiel, wait!

376
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,041
You won't find anything to buy.

377
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,000
It's empty.

378
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,041
Sickness ravaged the place.

379
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,458
The Black Plague.

380
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,166
[EZEKIEL] So, she's not
protecting everyone after all.

381
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,750
[PRIAPUS]
Huh?

382
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,583
[EZEKIEL] Maria's not the saint
she paints herself out to be.

383
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,291
She only helps those who
come begging at her door.

384
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,791
This is the proof.

385
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,333
She could have easily saved
the people of this village.

386
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,166
Instead, it's a charnel house.

387
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,166
[PRIAPUS]
That's enough!

388
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,916
[EZEKIEL yells]
Wait! Your claws!

389
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,833
They're very sharp!
Very painful! Ah!

390
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,625
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

391
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,958
[EZEKIEL yelps, grunts]

392
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,458
You're the slowest
winged creature

393
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,666
that I have ever seen. And you
simply cannot stay silent.

394
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,125
I demand to know why!

395
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,916
What right has she to decide
which village may perish?

396
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,625
Well, your God didn't
save them either. Right?

397
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,875
Everything goes
according to His plan.

398
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,916
It's not for us to question
the will of the Most High.

399
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,583
[sighs] Must be easy for you.

400
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,583
All that's required is
that you have some faith.

401
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,833
Oh really?

402
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,416
So you think it's easy
having to explain myself

403
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,166
to the likes of a
half-made familiar?

404
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,333
[growls]

405
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,833
[ANN]
Bonjour, vous duex!

406
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,208
[BOTH gasp]

407
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,625
I bet Maria sent you here

408
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,375
with the medicine for
Grandmother, huh?

409
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,291
Thank you, Priapus and Dovey!

410
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,250
My name is Ezekiel!

411
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,791
[bells ringing]

412
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,541
Ah, Maria.

413
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,791
It sounds as though she's
back to her usual self.

414
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,583
[PRIAPUS] She's full of the
same strong spirit as before.

415
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,791
Flitting hither and
yon through the skies.

416
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,291
Had I the strength to go,
I'd gladly pay her a visit.

417
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,000
Alas, these bones aren't as
young as they used to be.

418
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,708
When I was a
younger woman,

419
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,458
I would play with
Maria every day.

420
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,250
[MARIA giggles]

421
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,291
[MARTHA] We spent each
season in its turn together.

422
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,875
I cherish every memory.

423
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,083
[PRIAPUS]
Maria often smiles

424
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,166
at the thought of
you as well, madame.

425
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,666
Her medicine has granted
me more days than

426
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,166
I could have seen otherwise.
I am forever in her debt.

427
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,583
I thank her every visit!

428
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,666
Don't worry!

429
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,041
That's a good girl, dearie.

430
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:04,000
May the Lord bless
and keep our Maria.

431
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,958
Heresy.

432
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,125
--[ANN] Huh?
--[PRIAPUS] Hm?

433
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,791
[EZEKIEL]
You seem devout, at first blush.

434
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,708
A servant of God Almighty.

435
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,791
But, you pray for
a witch's safety.

436
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,375
You of all should
know full well,

437
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,166
that her magic defies
the will of Heaven.

438
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,583
But she's nice.

439
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,041
[EZEKIEL] Receiving
ministrations by her hand!

440
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,625
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

441
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,958
Hey!

442
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,958
[EZEKIEL] To pray for her
is mockery of the faith!

443
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,541
Long before dear
Ann here was born,

444
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,208
the towns and villages of
France were hit with pestilence.

445
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,375
[EZEKIEL huffs]

446
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,291
Would that I could
forget those dark days.

447
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:40,083
All around us,
people perished by the hundreds.

448
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,500
The nearby village
was ravaged by it.

449
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,916
We were certain ours was next.

450
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,541
We prayed night and day for
God above to deliver us.

451
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,583
His Mercy came in
the form of Maria.

452
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,333
She gave us medicine
of her own devising.

453
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,958
Medicine that spared every
one of us from the black death.

454
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,750
Had we died, my precious
Ann never would have been born.

455
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,541
How can I not be
grateful to Maria, then?

456
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,791
But, still.

457
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,583
I worship God in heaven
as devoutly as anybody,

458
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,375
but He works in mysterious ways,

459
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,291
and I believe that
she is one of them.

460
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,458
[MARIA yelps]

461
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,958
[MARIA grunts]

462
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,500
I heard that one
of your children

463
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,708
drank water from a tainted well.

464
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,875
If you give them this, I swear
their sickness will end.

465
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,375
In the name of Almighty God,
I command you to leave us!

466
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,875
[MARIA gasps]

467
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,666
[VILLAGER murmur]

468
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,625
[FRENCH PRIEST] No child of God
shall live by a witch's grace!

469
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,833
[gasps]

470
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,583
[FRENCH PRIEST]
Get thee hence, hell-spawn!

471
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,500
We are safe in
the light of Christ!

472
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,041
Thanks again! Travel safe!

473
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,208
[EZEKIEL] Those that ask,
she will save, but not others.

474
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,791
Are you still not satisfied?

475
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,375
[EZEKIEL]
Wait, Priapus.

476
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,208
[EZEKIEL] If everyone wished it,
would Maria, become like God?

477
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,416
[PRIAPUS]
Huh?

478
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,666
[EZEKIEL] Why're you
looking at me like that?

479
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,375
[PRIAPUS] You did
say "become like God".

480
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,333
Ah! Well, I certainly
didn't mean become like the God!

481
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,500
Why to even speak such a
thing aloud is a cardinal sin!

482
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,125
All I'm saying is that I
want to understand why

483
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,083
she does the things she does.

484
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:39,166
[EZEKIEL] And it seems these
people really respect her.

485
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,833
If you still don't get it,
there is one way.

486
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,666
Just ask her yourself.

487
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,000
Huh?

488
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,333
[PRIAPUS] That's the best
way to an answer, right?

489
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,375
You have plenty
of opportunities.

490
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,875
We gotta finish shopping.

491
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:50,708
Come on.

492
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,833
[EZEKIEL]
Um.

493
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,250
[PRIAPUS]
Yeah?

494
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,250
[EZEKIEL] Please don't,
carry me in your claws again.

495
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,875
Well then, you had
better keep up, right?

496
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,666
I'll fly slow for you.

497
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,083
I think she wanted
fresh eggs, isn't that right?

498
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,541
Lead on, Sir Cook.

499
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,125
"Sir Cook," huh?

500
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,875
I wish Maria'd let me
barter my ladle for a lance.

501
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:14,916
[OLD VILLAGER grunting]

502
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:24,500
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

503
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,666
[GILBERT] The final soul
in the northern village

504
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,000
has been called to his reward.

505
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,916
[BERNARD] The hamlet that
suffered most under the plague?

506
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,125
[GILBERT]
Yes, Brother.

507
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,791
He was the only one
to survive its wrath.

508
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,166
[GILBERT]
He lived a devout life,

509
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,125
offering daily prayers for
the repose of the dead.

510
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,333
[BERNARD]
He was blessed.

511
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,666
Truly the definition
of faith in practice.

512
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,375
His work must be honored.

513
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,041
It is the very least
the we can do for him.

514
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,958
And still, not nearly enough.

515
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,208
Yes.

516
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,208
We've news of the witch's
movements as well.

517
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,041
It seems that the
surrounding forest

518
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,666
is connected to Maria
in some strange way.

519
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,375
What would you
have us do, Brother?

520
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,125
It would be easy
to disregard this

521
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:07,083
and keep silent, yet...

522
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,416
Gilbert.

523
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,833
Carry a missive
to our noble lord.

524
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,625
[GILBERT]
Yes. Of course.

525
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:13,833
[BERNARD]
Say that Brother Bernard

526
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,000
has urgent news to convey.

527
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,791
News of battle which
have yet to begin.

528
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,250
I did what I could.
Now it's on Galfa.

529
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,541
[JEAN]
Heh! What a wretched opponent!

530
00:23:58,625 --> 00:23:59,958
[MARIA]
It's such a conundrum.

531
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,458
One that I'll have
to figure out someday.

532
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,541
He'll kill him!

533
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,583
Begin!
