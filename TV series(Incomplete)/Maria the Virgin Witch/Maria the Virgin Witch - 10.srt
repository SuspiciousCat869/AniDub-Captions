1
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,958
Shining blades held fast in
the hands of silent legions,

2
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,916
dance upon the broken
wings of Bladud!

3
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,708
[VIV]
Damn you, Michael!

4
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,000
Bloody hell!

5
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,875
Stay your hand.
This fight is not thine, witch.

6
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:44,875
[EZEKIEL]
Please, Viv!

7
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,458
[VIV]
What?! Ezekiel!

8
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,041
[EZEKIEL] You cannot hope to lay
hands upon a blessed Archangel!

9
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,208
Surrender, Viv! You must!

10
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,541
Not a chance in hell!

11
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,583
[EZEKIEL gasps]

12
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,000
Ever-loyal Cordelia,
I call to thee.

13
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,416
Show this witch 
thy enduring faith!

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,125
Why are you still fighting?

15
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,666
For Maria!

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,875
I know you won't stand for her
to be held captive, either!

17
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,375
[EZEKIEL]
No, but...

18
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,500
[VIV] Humans ache for divine
love, but God never answers.

19
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,291
Do you know why?

20
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,291
[EZEKIEL]
Huh?

21
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,708
[VIV]
It's simple, really.

22
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,958
Almighty God knows
nothing of love.

23
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,416
Does he? Tell her
the truth, Michael!

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,125
Or I'll tell it for you! We
mortals are the creators of it!

25
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,333
You can't even comprehend
love, angel!

26
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,791
How could we ever be subservient
to the likes of you!

27
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,166
[laughs]

28
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm right, aren't I?
And that's God's truth!

29
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,166
[gasps]

30
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,416
[ARTEMIS]
Viv!

31
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:47,833
Uh...

32
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,833
[VIV gasping]

33
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,708
Viv! Are you all right?

34
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:59,416
I sealed up the wound.
Nothing to it.

35
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,416
[ARTEMIS]
Viv!

36
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,750
[EZEKIEL]
Saint Michael, why?

37
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,750
Surely you see that was
an extreme punishment

38
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,416
not fitting her offense!

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,250
The girl did not earn her
punishment by raising a hand

40
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,708
in violence to me.
Her rebuke was meant

41
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,666
for the Lord of Hosts,
which cannot be countenanced.

42
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,625
You think her words empty?

43
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,875
Attend. Does wheat chastise
the farmer saying,

44
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,958
"'Tis not yet time
for the harvest"?

45
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,708
Even if such words were given,

46
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,750
would the farmer ever heed
the council of simple wheat?

47
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,375
[EZEKIEL whimpers]

48
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:17,750
Oh, I really hope Maria's
wounds have fully healed by now.

49
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:22,000
Stewed mole should suffice if
they return in need, correct?

50
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,125
What if the mole
isn't to her liking?

51
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,375
--Truly? Viv, neither?
--[knocking]

52
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,458
[ARTEMIS]
Edwina! Edwina, open up!

53
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,250
It's Viv. Please, hurry!

54
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,541
[EDWINA] The mole couldn't
have been that bad, surely!

55
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,333
[GILBERT]
Maria of the forest.

56
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,208
You are hereby accused
of sowing chaos

57
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,875
and discord while professing
yourself a heathen witch

58
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,916
in defiance of
the Lord, our God.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,416
Will you confess your sin?

60
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,208
Since the moment of my birth,
I have been a witch.

61
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,791
Admitting it now will make
not a shred of difference.

62
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,416
[GILBERT] Have you received
the sacrament of baptism?

63
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,791
[MARIA]
I don't know.

64
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,625
I will ask this of you again.

65
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,541
Have you received
the sacrament--

66
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,875
I said I don't know!

67
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,916
[GUILLAUME] This is our chance,
my boy. I'll not let it pass.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,333
What about Lady Maria?

69
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:10,333
Can you speak of nothing
else but your "Lady Maria"?

70
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,625
I speak of the Britons, Joseph!

71
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,791
[JOSEPH]
Of course, sir.

72
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:14,875
[GUILLAUME]
Those cowardly English dogs

73
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,708
had their very
armaments torn fresh

74
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,875
from their hands by some
power far greater than we are.

75
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,791
From their fingers, to the sky!

76
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,041
Mayhap some witch or spirit
drew them on, milord.

77
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,708
[GUILLAUME] 
It matters little.

78
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,125
Providence stands
firm at our side.

79
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,125
The Britons have fled to the
walls of a nearby castle town,

80
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,958
with no arms to speak of.

81
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,000
[JOSEPH] Surely they'll loot
the town for new steel.

82
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,583
[GUILLAUME] What paltry arms
could mere peasants have?

83
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:41,041
Besides, 'tis but a whisper
before the thunder our cannons

84
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,541
can bring to bear upon them.
We will grind them to dust.

85
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,958
If fate should dote on us,

86
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,916
this could turn the entire
war to our favor.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,416
Always more warfare.

88
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,750
The inquisition has only
just begun its trial,

89
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,458
and there is sure to be no
decision for some time.

90
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,791
Serve me with valor
in the coming battle,

91
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,041
and I'll see that
your Maria is freed.

92
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,833
Until then, my boy,
you must fight.

93
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:08,125
For my Lady Maria...
I will serve.

94
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,416
[GILBERT]
Have you no fear

95
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,791
of God's wrath and eternal
condemnation, witch?

96
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,208
You do not heed the Gospel.

97
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,000
You use wicked conjurations
to blunder into wars.

98
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,708
Do you not see your
own arrogance?

99
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,750
You just love the sound
of your own voice,

100
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,875
don't you, Inquisitor?
It is not about arrogance.

101
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,916
I simply despise death.
Nothing else to it.

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,166
[MERCENARIES chatter]

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,541
[MERCENARY A]
Huh?

104
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,000
[JOSEPH grunts]

105
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,791
Nice throw. You're almost cute
when you're angry, dear boy.

106
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,125
Enough! I demand you tell me

107
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,166
where that craven
Galfa ran off to!

108
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,250
[LOLOTTE] No idea. Maybe he's
found a new doxy to play with.

109
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,125
Why not try the battlefield?
That's home to Galfa.

110
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,541
Far more than this place is.

111
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,916
It's e'er the same reply!

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,458
[gasps]

113
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:05,666
Wherever I turn, fate drags
me onwards! Always to battle!

114
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,875
Battle! Battle! Dammit!

115
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,666
Even the word itself
seems to hound my heels.

116
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,666
Only for you, Lady Maria.

117
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,375
Will you confess your
sins to God Almighty?

118
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,041
Will you beg forgiveness for
your many lies and falsehoods?

119
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,541
Never! Spew your lies.

120
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,208
They cannot change
who I am inside.

121
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,708
[GILBERT] Even now, after I
have offered her confession,

122
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,458
and the absolution of her sins,

123
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,583
she remains strong
in her defiance.

124
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,458
She says that she will ever
remain a witch in her heart.

125
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,750
Our duty in this is clear.

126
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,041
[GILBERT]
Frere Bernard!

127
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,041
[BERNARD]
Yes?

128
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,541
[GILBERT]
What say you, Brother?

129
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:47,416
[BERNARD] Right. Yes. Gilbert.
Proceed as you see fit.

130
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,291
Have you lost interest
in the witch's trial?

131
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:54,791
Interest? Funny. Now there's
a word. I have faith

132
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:59,333
that you will do what you must
to put an end this matter.

133
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,875
[GILBERT exhales]

134
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,083
[EDWINA]
It was a very close thing,

135
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,208
but Viv will keep her life.

136
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,958
Although she is no less a fool
for challenging Saint Michael.

137
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:17,583
Even the Valkyries dare not face
him. What madness ensnares me?

138
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:21,166
Edwina. Maria is still held
captive, but you can help.

139
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,083
[EDWINA gasps]
Why ask this of me?

140
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,625
Are you not her friend?

141
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:28,333
I, her friend? Certainly you
jest. I hardly even know her.

142
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,333
[ARTEMIS]
Maria would beg to disagree.

143
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:35,208
[gasps] S-Still, even
if we truly are friends,

144
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,666
my powers pale in comparison
to hers and Viv's.

145
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,583
I could not stand
against Michael.

146
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,083
All I want is to work on
my mixtures in peace.

147
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,458
You would just abandon her?

148
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,875
[EDWINA gasps]

149
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,791
[MARTHA]
Forgive me.

150
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,708
I betrayed my truest friend
at the whim of the church.

151
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,916
But Dovey. Maria always
tried to keep us safe.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,125
Why does the Church
want to hurt her?

153
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,625
[EZEKIEL] That is only, the will
of mankind's Church on Earth.

154
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,416
The Heavenly Host would
never harm its flock.

155
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,833
[ANN]
But, everyone tells me

156
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:07,541
the Church is supposed to
talk for Heaven, isn't it?

157
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:11,750
I don't understand, but...
This is all so wrong, Dovey!

158
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,916
Please! Tell me how I
can make it all better!

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,833
[EZEKIEL]
I wish I could tell you.

160
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,708
I thought seeing Martha
would help show me

161
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,583
the path I should take.

162
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,625
[JOSEPH] I will fight for
Lady Maria if I must.

163
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,958
When I return, we will free
her from the Inquisition.

164
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:34,333
Do we really have the time to
hesitate now? Let's go at once!

165
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,458
I'd like nothing more than
to storm her prison.

166
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,166
That said, if we should fail,

167
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,541
it only serves to
make things worse.

168
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,708
[PRIAPUS]
I'm just a familiar.

169
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,041
[JOSEPH gasps]

170
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,083
[PRIAPUS] But I know Maria
hopes more than anything

171
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,666
that you'll come rushing
to her rescue.

172
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,833
[JOSEPH] This battle
will not be my end.

173
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:01,500
I shall save Lady Maria,
and then...

174
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,750
And then...

175
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,291
[FRENCH CAPTAIN A]
Forward!

176
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,583

protect this realm!

177
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,916
[FRENCH SOLDIERS] Saint Barbara,

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,916
Saint Barbara,

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,166
[FRENCH CAPTAIN A]
Saint Barbara!

180
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,000
We beseech your blessing
upon these cannons!

181
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,625
[FRENCH SOLDIERS] Saint Barbra,
we beseech your blessing!

182
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,291
Saint Barbra,
we beseech your blessing!

183
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,416
[FRENCH CAPTAIN A]
We march!

184
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,666

185
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,000
[FRENCH SOLDIERS] Saint Barbara,

00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,791
Saint Barbara, defend our King!

187
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,666
[JOSEPH] I'll see you safe,
Lady Maria. And then...

188
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,041
[PRIAPUS]
Then Joseph looked at me,

189
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,708
and said he'd come back soon
and save you for sure!

190
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,916
[MARIA laughs]
That fool boy.

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,500
What does he think he can
accomplish in battle?

192
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,583
I guess men will
ever play the fools,

193
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,333
when Ares beckons them forth.

194
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,625
[PRIAPUS] Master. Is your
magic still sealed away?

195
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,416
[MARIA]
I think. [grunts]

196
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,625
Seems so. Why has it not
yet returned to me?

197
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,250
[PRIAPUS]
Worry not, Maria.

198
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,375
Truly, there's still
plenty of time.

199
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,750
Viv will come flying in here
with the whole Guild!

200
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,625
Artemis went to go
get them and they--

201
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,541
[banging]

202
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,541
[PRIAPUS]
What's that sound?

203
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,083
[FRENCH INQUISITION MEN]
Heave-ho!

204
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,416
[FEMALE A]
If you're burned in the flames,

205
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,708
how will your soul find
its way to Heaven?

206
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,000
[FEMALE B] The Inquisition
came to a fast verdict!

207
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,500
[MALE A] To be sure,
they fear the witch.

208
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,000
[FEMALE C] I think
they wanted this farce

209
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,291
to be over and done with.

210
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,541
[MALE B] There's no
telling when the witch

211
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,791
will use her magic and
make good her escape.

212
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,333
[MALE C]
A man in the market said

213
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,958
she would take normal people and
turn them into her thralls!

214
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,875
[FEMALE D]
Will you or not, it's decided.

215
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,500
She'll burn on the morrow.

216
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,208
[PRIAPUS]
On the morrow? Oh, no!

217
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,958
The flames?
On the morrow?

218
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,416
[PRIAPUS]
Stay put!

219
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,250
I'll go find Artemis and see
what's taking her so long!

220
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,458
[MARIA]
Priapus!

221
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,625
Don't go.

222
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,166
Le Comte's wishes
are quite clear.

223
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,291
Yet, still, his judgment was
rendered in great haste.

224
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,541
He doesn't risk the witch
regaining her power.

225
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,291
[GILBERT] Like as not, His Noble
Self wishes to make known

226
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,875
his own powers.
But I am the Magistrate.

227
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,500
By rights, it is my decision to
condemn the witch to the flames.

228
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,875
[FRENCH INQUISITION CAPTAIN A]
The result is the same.

229
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,333
[GILBERT]
And the choice is still mine.

230
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,541
I referenced many texts
on the Inquisition law.

231
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,166
This path holds most true.

232
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,000
What of Frere Bernard's wishes?

233
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,375
I thought he'd taken
interest in the witch.

234
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:26,250
Frere Bernard is...
no longer a concern.

235
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,833
[ARTEMIS] There's no time to
lose. We must fly now!

236
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,041
[PRIAPUS]
Then let's make haste!

237
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,625
But, what of Viv?

238
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,958
She only just drank my elixir.
It's like to keep her dreaming

239
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,000
until tomorrow evening
at the earliest.

240
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,541
[PRIAPUS] But they'll be
done with it by then!

241
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,041
What of the other witches?

242
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,833
[EDWINA] I'm afraid I
couldn't reach them.

243
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,500
[PRIAPUS]
Then it must fall to you!

Please, help us save Maria!

246
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,625
There's no way!

00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,625
[PRIAPUS] I'll do anything
you want! I swear, on my soul!

--Take my body!

Claim me! I'm yours!
Take your pleasure from me!

250
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,083
Would you just shut
up for a second?

251
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,041
But, I don't know
how else to help!

252
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,333
Stop with the excuses.
Now, Edwina!

253
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,500
What can I do? Saint Michael
is hunting down witches!

254
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,666

face the Archangel!

not ready to die.

you. Tend well to Viv.

We will do what we can to save
her, but this isn't the end.

longer secure here.

00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,041

Please be safe, Edwina.

expect of a coward like me?

And how is the latter faring?

She feels that she's
betrayed you.

271
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,291
She should not
torment herself.

272
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:04,250

She and Ann are scared for you!

273

see them but once more.

[EZEKIEL]
You can see them!

275
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,333
All you must do is ask
forgiveness of Heaven.

276
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,291
Forgiveness.

277
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,083
[EZEKIEL] It's that simple,

to put an end to war?

Now, tie her to the stake.

341
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,958
[ARTEMIS] I'll create a
commotion while you untie Maria.

342
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,041
[PRIAPUS] Why should you be
the one to dive in there?

343
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,333
[ARTEMIS]
They'd kill you.

344
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,791
[PRIAPUS] Maybe so, but...
I'd die to save her.

345
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,333
[ARTEMIS]
You idiot. We'll go together.

346
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,375
Lady Maria, grant me strength.

347
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,333
I will win your freedom
upon this day!

348
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,500
Hear me, Le Comte! I bring
news from the cannonade!

349
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,458
The Cambier Mons Meg
is ready to fire.

350
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,958
We await your command to light!

351
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,333
Ha, ha! Excellent! Let this
salvo be the last they hear!

352
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,125
Saint Barbara,
defend us this day!

353

[FRENCH SOLDIERS panting]

[FRENCH SOLDIERS grunting]

355
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,791
Fire!

[FRENCH SOLDIERS cheer]

357
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,833
Ride forth!

358
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,250
[FRENCH SOLDIER E]
Men of France! Forward!

359
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,041
Heh. Better to flee, Joseph.

360
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:33,083
Foolish. I was such a...
a fool in the end--

361
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,416
[coughs]

362
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,958
[ARTEMIS]
Let's go save our master!

363
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,000
[PRIAPUS]
Right!

364
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,125
What the...?

365
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,708
Who... is that?

366
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,708
That light.
Is she a fellow witch?

367
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,541
[EDWINA grunts]
My body's definitely not used

368
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,333
to flying like that anymore.

369
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,458
Curse you, daylight.
Why are you so bright?

370
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,708
Edwina. It's you.

371
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,708
I came for thee. What are you
doing tied up on that pyre?

372
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,958
I won't let you get burned!

373
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,333
Huh?

374
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,333
[EDWINA] If you let yourself
get caught this easy,

375
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,166
no witch is going
to be respected!

376
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,708
What if the Church starts a
new witch hunt after this?

377
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,250
I don't follow.

378
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,958
People's fear and respect for
witches is how we stay safe!

379
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,208
Seize her at once.

380
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,750
Yes, at once.
Soldiers to the fore!

381
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,375
[FRENCH INQUISITION MEN clamor]

382
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,000
[EDWINA]
Belisama, now! Grant me fire!

383
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,583

00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,083

Thank goodness you're here.

00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:29,791
[ARTEMIS]
Edwina!

386
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,458
Get her down from there!

387
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,291
[EDWINA] Raise up shields!
Tarvos Trigaranos!

388
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,958
I need your strength
a little longer!

389
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,083
I swear one of the witches
will make amends!

390
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,166
With all this magic I really
hope Saint Michael

391
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,416
is looking elsewhere
at the moment.

392
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,958
[RÉGLISSE]
The shield's fading, Master!

Edwina!

00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,500
[EDWINA] I've already come this
far to save your life, Maria.

396
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,916
I may as well use all I have!

397
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,375
Nantosuelta!
Lend me your fires!

00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,791
[EDWINA] We can find refuge
at my house for now.

[MARIA]
Take me to the battlefield.

403
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,375
[ALL]
What?

404
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,875
[EDWINA]
To the battlefield?

405
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,708
But Miss Maria. Your magic
power still hasn't come back.

406
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,333
There's still a war going on.
And I intend to stop it.

[GALFA grunts]

410
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,625
So are you hoping to find some
nice loot in the cathedral, boy?

411
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,083
Or maybe you're
just here to hide?

412
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:11,000
I came to find glory worthy
of Lady Maria's freedom!

413
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,708
But now I stare upon foul
inequity made flesh!

414
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,166
[GALFA] I haven't got any
pretty words for you, Joseph.

415
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,000

What a spine she's got.

419
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:01,208
I've hated your eyes from the
first time they looked at me!

about. Like ants.
