00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,791
Hear me, all you
fighting men of England!

2
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,625
Abandon this war and
return to your homes!

3
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,000
[ENGLISH CAPTAIN A]
Nock your arrows, lads!

4
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,125
I want that witch brought down!

5
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,875
[grunts]
That's your answer, then?

6
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,708
Fine. I tried.

7
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,833
O, Melusine, loved and
wronged by Count Pwa two.

8
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,333
Heed this witch's call
and hie thee to my hearth,

9
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,833
so that all may behold you!

10
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:48,875

[ENGLISH SOLDIERS yelling]

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,750
[ENGLISH SOLDIER A]
It's Melusine!

13
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,250
[ENGLISH SOLDIER B]
Saints preserve us!

14
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,916
[ENGLISH SOLDIER C] I signed
on to fight men, not myths!

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,291
[ENGLISH SOLDIER D]
Run!

16
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,791
[MARIA giggles] Well,
that seemed to do the trick.

17
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,916
[EZEKIEL] This is a flagrant
breach of Saint Michael's

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,416
ban on magic!

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,291
I'm just watching men retreat.

20
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,041
I'm well within my
rights to do that.

21
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,708
Oh, so this dragon and
Melusine are here by chance?!

22
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:15,875
Je ne sais pas.

23
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,208
I'm not a fool, Maria!
Stop lying to me!

24
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,916
Look, Ezekiel. You didn't
see who did it did you?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,500
So, you can't just assume
I'm the guilty one here!

26
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,791
[growls]

27
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,500
[BERNARD]
Much as we anticipated.

28
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,291
England's forces around Rouen

29
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:32,291
have been scattered
by the witch, Maria.

30
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,291
They will probably
retreat through Lisieux,

31
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:37,583
and then onward to Caen.
God be praised.

32
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:40,541
[GUILLAUME] He seems to have
given you the gift of prophesy.

33
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,333
You might have been
another Alexander,

34
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,208
had you taken up the sword.

35
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,791
[BERNARD]
Your wisdom has guided me thus.

36
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,583
But know that I, too,
am a soldier.

37
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:49,875
Huh?

38
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,833
Sharing the faith
with the people,

39
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,791
absolving their sins,
and praying for the safe return

40
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,208
of their men night and day.

41
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,625
These are the
battlefields I war upon.

42
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,875
The battlefields of the soul.

43
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,750
With the proper
nourishment and care,

44
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,125
a tree may bear a great bounty.

45
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,291
The heart of man
is a little different.

46
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:13,833
Assuming, of course that one
crushes all which afflicts it.

47
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,375
--[VILLAGERS chatter]
--[FRENCH KNIGHT A moans]

48
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,791
[scoffs] Listen to him,
hollering like a novice.

49
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,250
[JOSEPH]
Galfa, well met.

50
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,083
Huh? Perfect timing.
I think I need a chapeau.

51
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,458
Well, whaddya think?

52
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,125
Well, I think it suits you.
And the shade is good.

53
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,875
Wise beyond his years!

54
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,750
S'that so? He, he.

55
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,833
Purchase it. If not,

56
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,125
Then I am afraid that I'll
have to lend you my chapeau.

57
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,000
Huh?

58
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,291
Uh, about that.

59
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,000
[GALFA]
Come again?

60
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,041
[gasps]

61
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,500
Stunning lance-work, sir knight!

62
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,750
But, he's cavalry.

63
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,666
What is he doing
in your encampment?

64
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,416
[GALFA] She's our go-between
with the mounted knights.

65
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,333
She's mounted and
they go-between.

66
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,750
[LOLOTTE]
Your name's Joseph, right?

67
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,958
Oui.

68
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,500
There's no charge for
a friend of Galfa's.

69
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,208
What? But I barely know you!

70
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,750
Stop. He's about
to piss himself.

71
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,666
[LOLOTTE]
Aw.

72
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,416
So, then, 'bout your cap.

73
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,875
[JOSEPH]
Huh?

74
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,833
[GALFA] You were sayin' you
were gonna lend me yours.

75
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,541
That's right. You will
need a cap to doff.

76
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,416
My master, Le Comte Guillaume,

77
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,208
is most eager to make
your acquaintance, Galfa.

78
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,583
Why me?

79
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,791
There's somebody to whom
he'd like to introduce you.

80
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,875
[GALFA] But Yvain's
the boss around here.

81
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,791
[EZEKIEL] Are you listening
to a word I say, Maria?

82
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,625
War holds no
delight for them!

83
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,000
You don't need to scatter them
hither and yon with dragons.

84
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,666
Let them wage their battles and
they'll go home soon enough!

85
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,125
Says the one who won't leave.

86
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,750
If you've time enough
to yell at her,

87
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,000
you've time enough to
help with the housework.

88
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,708
You know, Saint Michael
didn't send me here

89
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,250
to tend to a heretic's hearth!

90
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,416
[sighs]

91
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,458
I guess I'll skulk
around England's tents

92
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,833
later and see what comes up.

93
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,416
Good thinking, Artemis.
What are your plans tonight?

94
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,625
Unlike that one,

95
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,500
I won't be trying to
lure good men into sin!

96
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,208
I'll monitor Maria's actions,
the same as always!

97
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,208
[ARTEMIS]
Maria! Time to eat!

98
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:32,208
[MARIA] Mm. Hey, you didn't
happen to see Viv

99
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,583
at the battlefield, did you?

100
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,916
She was there,

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,708
but she left not long
after I laid eyes on her.

102
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:41,125
Viv hails from England,
she told us as much.

103
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,583
Is she really that unmoved by
the plight of her countrymen?

104
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,875
--[VIV] Huh?
--[RÉGLISSE] meows

105
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,041
Please don't tell me

106
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,291
you're staying here
tonight again, Viv.

107
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,750
It's really a bother.

108
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,208
[VIV]
Come now. I'm worth it.

109
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,250
Do I have to drink your favorite
apple cider all by my lonesome?

110
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,666
[EDWINA] Don't drag me
into your messes, Viv.

111
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,291
I just want to live a
quiet life in peace.

112
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,833
[VIV]
Really, Edwina. That's hurtful.

113
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,250
If anyone's being dragged
into something, it's me.

114
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,333
[EDWINA]
Hm? By who?

115
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,125
[VIV giggles]

116
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,000
[GUILLAUME]
You've a cool head, Galfa.

117
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,291
You've proved as
much in that duel.

118
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,458
[GALFA]
Uh. Thank you, milord.

119
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,208
[GUILLAUME] I was
surprised to learn Joseph's

120
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,583
a friend of yours.
I've always thought the lad

121
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,041
to be rather cloistered
in his relations.

122
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,875
Twas prudent to cultivate
a comrade such as you.

123
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,708
Uh, merci, milord.

124
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,208
[GUILLAUME]
Answer me this, Galfa.

125
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,625
Sir?

126
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,125
Is it true that, after the duel,
you took your new wealth

127
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,375
and shared it among your
fellow mercenaries?

128
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,666
[GALFA grumbles]

129
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,208
We've been havin'
a lean time of it.

130
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,458
I don't need the men
at my back fainting

131
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,041
for want of a good meal.

132
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,541
[BERNARD] It seems that you are
a shepherd among your flock.

133
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:51,166
I presume there is much to
be gained from this meeting.

134
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,833
Um...

135
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,166
Pleased to meet you.

136
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,333
I am Le Comte Guillaume's
nephew and confessor,

137
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,458
however, you may
call me Bernard.

138
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,125
And I take it you're a monk?

139
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,333
[BERNARD] The Lord called me,
and I obeyed His summons.

140
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,750
[BERNARD] As a sinner,
do you fear the gaze of God?

141
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:13,541
Galfa, do you submit yourself
to the authority of the Church?

142
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,666
I will always heed God and
those who work for Him.

143
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,541
Only reason I survived the
duel with that bastard knight,

144
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,458
is because the Lord
granted me His favor.

145
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,250
You think your deeds
were righteous, then, my son?

146
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,958
[GALFA]
I'm alive, ain't I?

147
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,583
If they weren't, I'd be dead.

148
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,916
Well said.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,750
The simple bedrock of
your faith is refreshing.

150
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,041
Yeah. Thanks.

151
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,833
So, what is it that
you want with me?

152
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,541
Galfa, the heretical witch-girl,
Maria, walks the path to Hell.

153
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,375
It would please me greatly
if we could redeem her soul.

154
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,916
[gasps]

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,291
[BERNARD]
But, If she continues

156
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,625
to flout her sinful
deeds, then...

157
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,500
Then cut her down?

158
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:54,708
But, milord! To strike her
down in cold blood is--

159
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,125
Oh Please, Frere Bernard!

160
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,416
[sighs]

161
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,958
Yes, she's a witch,

162
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,666
but she's saved the lives of
Englishmen and Frenchmen alike!

163
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,791
All she desires is
a peaceful world.

164
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,541
Is that not a righteous goal?

165
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,041
To slay her after she's
granted us so many blessings

166
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,250
--would be the height of tre--
--Steel your tongue!

167
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,583
She grants no blessings, boy.

168
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,416
If you must needs
be told that much,

169
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,250
--then you are already lost.
--[JOSEPH gasps]

170
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,250
Yes, my words are clumsy,
but nonetheless!

171
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,500
[BERNARD] The soul's
a pearl of great worth.

172
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:26,000
Even hers, and I did say
"if she continues," did I not?

173
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:29,208
Once the war has ended,
her dark arts serve no purpose.

174
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,750
Then, her life would
no longer be in danger.

175
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,041
I heard even the Archangel
came to give her warning.

176
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,083
[BERNARD]
You see, lad.

177
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,875
She creates the peril she faces.

178
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,458
Yes.

179
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,500
[GUILLAUME] I trust you'll keep
the good monk's words in mind

180
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,750
when the moment arises,
friend Galfa.

181
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:46,750
Aye, milord.

182
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,750
Joseph, I need you
to go tell Maria

183
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,791
of our next battle,
and be quick to return.

184
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,500
But, milord--!

185
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,791
[GUILLAUME]
Joseph!

186
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,208
Your father served
me for many a year,

187
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,166
and served me well at that.

188
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,833
I expect no less of you
than I did of him, lad.

189
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,541
[GALFA] Pretty gutsy,
mouthing off at your betters.

190
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,125
That girl must be something.

191
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,458
[JOSEPH]
Yes.

192
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,250
In truth, it pained me
to speak so rebelliously,

193
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,833
but I couldn't let
them slander her so.

194
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,791
Her only ambition in this is
to prevent more bloodshed.

195
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,208
Uh-huh.

196
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,708
I wanna hear it from her
own mouth, if it's all the same.

197
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:20,958
[VILLAGERS chatter]

198
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,833
[GILBERT] Thank you
for your continued help.

199
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,291
It's my pleasure.

200
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,500
[GILBERT]
The medicines you provide

201
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,541
grant much succor to
our afflicted, so too

202
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,791
your ken of England.

203
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,000
It seems that they are gathering
alongside the main road.

204
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,333
As I learn more,
I will pass it along.

205
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,500
But, of course, there are
limits to what a peddler

206
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,250
such as myself can observe.

207
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:44,083
You grant us a great boon.
Until we should meet again.

208
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:51,458
[GALFA] Huh. So, those're
your familiars? Interesting.

209
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,875
[GALFA]
Not so fearsome when you're

210
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,625
not pulling monsters out
of your cauldron, huh, kid?

211
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,750
I wonder what you'll
look like as a toad.

212
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,625
Oh, boy. You'll make for
some fun when you're older.

213
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,666
[gasps]
Joseph, who is this pig?

214
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,083
[JOSEPH]
Uh, this is Galfa!

215
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,541
He's a friend of mine!

216
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,875
[gasps]

217
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,541
You're the one who beat
that knight half to death.

218
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,083
[GALFA chuckles]
Impressed, yeah?

219
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,125
It may fall on me to kill
you later, so don't get smitten.

220
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,041
[JOSEPH growls]

221
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,083
Huh?

222
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,708
That's it! Begone!

223
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,250
[GALFA]
Don't be so hasty.

224
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,541
I was only joking with you.
Wands beat swords in my deck.

225
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,916
Don't toy with her!

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,458
Easy, Joseph.

227
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:31,458
Nobody made mention of pay,
and witch-hunting's risky work.

228
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,833
Only reason I'm here is
I wanted to meet this girl

229
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,583
you're always
natterin' on about.

230
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:36,791
Does he really do that?

231
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,250
[JOSEPH] I wouldn't
say I natter on, milady!

232
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,166
You just come up a lot.

233
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,333
[MARIA gasps]
Ezekiel!

234
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,333
[gasps]

235
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,041
[MARIA]
I'm going out for a bit!

236
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,041
[JOSEPH]
Huh?

237
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:49,583
[gasps]

238
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,083
[JOSEPH yells]

239
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,500
[gasps]

240
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,166
What're you doing? Ah!

241
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,583
[MARIA]
Hang on tight, chatterbox.

242
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,208
[JOSEPH]
Yes, milady!

243
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,041
Never had a wench
pull that one on me!

244
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,541
Curse her indiscretion!

245
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:06,125
The heavens will rejoice when
she surrenders her magic!

246
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,041
[GALFA]
Wait! What are you saying?

247
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,166
Huh?

248
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,208
[JOSEPH whimpering]

249
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,958
Look, "hang on tight"
doesn't mean to smother me!

250
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:15,958
[JOSEPH]
Sorry!

251
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,000
[MARIA]
Courage, s'il vous plaît!

252
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,500
[BONNE]
Guillaume calls you yet again.

253
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,416
When last I fought, the Lord
saw fit to spare me.

254
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,166
And it please Him, then this
time will be no different.

255
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,250
[ANN]
Pas de problème!

256
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,791
Uh-huh!

257
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,625
I'll just ask Maria the witch
to protect you again, Papa!

258
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,416
[giggles]
au revoir!

259
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,541
[DENIS]
Huh? Hey!

260
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,625
[ANN]
I'll be home later!

261
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,333
I wonder if this could be a sin.

262
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,541
What, dear?

263
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,791
Hanging all of our hopes
on a witch's favor.

264
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,541
Why not? My mother holds
her in high esteem.

265
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,791
And that's, the problem.

266
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,500
[ANN giggles]

267
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,000
[MARIA]
So, how's your stomach?

268
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,416
[JOSEPH]
It's better now.

269
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,708
[MARIA]
First time aloft?

270
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,166
[JOSEPH]
I should think so.

271
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,833
It's fun, after you
get used to it.

272
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:24,375
This place. I've never
brought anyone here before.

273
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,625
Really?

274
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,000
[MARIA]
C'est magnifique.

275
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,291
It is.

276
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,750
[MARIA] So, then.
What brings you out today?

277
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,458
[JOSEPH] There's a battle
on the horizon, milady.

278
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,000
One larger in scope
than the others.

279
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,625
God willing, we can drive
the English out of Normandy.

280
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,166
If we can strike them now,

281
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,000
we can grant this land
a measure of peace.

282
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,625
Go on.

283
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,750
Milady, I beg of you.

284
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:04,333
Let us fight this battle
to a natural finish.

285
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,875
[MARIA sighs]

286
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,166
[yawns]

287
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,291
[ANN]
Hello, Dovey!

288
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,541
[EZEKIEL]
My name's Ezekiel!

289
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,916
Where's Maria?

290
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,666
I came to get medicine
for Grandmother again.

291
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,208
[EZEKIEL] She flew away with
that meek-hearted boy in tow.

292
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,666
Huh? So, she's gone?

293
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,166
[EZEKIEL sighs]
Patience, child.

294
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,500
I'm sure the medicine is about.

295
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:35,000
Thanks a lot!
Um... I made these!

296
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,291
This one's for you, Dovey!

297
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,166
[EZEKIEL]
Huh?

298
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,916
[ANN]
Everybody gets one.

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,500
Here's Maria's, and Artemis's,
and this one's for Priapus.

300
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,000
Please give these to them!

301
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,375
[EZEKIEL]
Fine.

302
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,416
And...

303
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,708
Well? Go on.

304
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,166
Papa. He has to fight again.

305
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,708
So, I wanted Maria
to look after him.

306
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,000
That way, he'll come back
safe and sound again.

307
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,208
She can't. Saint Michael
has forbidden it.

308
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,875
Just this once!
I won't tell anybody!

309
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,333
[EZEKIEL]
The answer is no.

310
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,458
Please, just, tell her I asked!

311
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,250
I guess I could let her know.

312
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,208
Thank you so much, Dovey!

313
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,125
I'll bring you a big
present next time!

314
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,041
[EZEKIEL] Look, I'll tell her,
but she's not going to do it!

315
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,916
Understand?

316
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,625
And again, my name isn't Dovey.

317
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,458
A-Archangel Michael!

318
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,125
[MICHAEL] To observe
and witness her choice.

319
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,208
That is your duty, Ezekiel.

320
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,916
Ultimately, if Maria should
choose hubris over

321
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,541
the will of the heavens, you are
to visit my judgment upon her.

322
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,666
Spear of the Heavenly Host.

323
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,166
[EZEKIEL]
Yes. Master.

324
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,458
[gasps]
Archangel Michael?

325
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,750
Is it so wrong of Maria

326
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,333
to want to save the lives
of her fellow man?

327
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,791
Their wishes never
move us to action.

328
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,916
Maria's a creature
of this world.

329
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,208
Why not leave matters of the
realm to one such as her?

330
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,458
[MICHAEL] Humanity is
fallible by its nature.

331
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:13,000
Consider the beasts of
the earth, the sea, and sky.

332
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,000
To them, the machinations
of humanity

333
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,875
are ever beyond their ken.

334
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,500
In that way, there are
levels of understanding

335
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,666
to which mankind cannot aspire.

336
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,416
This world is a crucible,

337
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,166
in which the Lord
skims the dross

338
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,666
from the souls of the righteous.

339
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,500
[EZEKIEL gasps]

340
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,041
Know you that
these utterances

341
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,083
are not of my mind, Ezekiel.
Heed these words.

342
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,166
They are those
of Almighty God.

343
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,750
My servant,

344
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,625
should the witch Maria display
her unholy powers but once more,

345
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,041
then set her soul
adrift by your own hand.

346
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:44,875
[EZEKIEL gasps]

347
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,916
I will obey.

348
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,708
I'll have to... kill her?

349
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:57,958
[bells ringing]

350
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,500
[GILBERT] I come bearing
urgent news, Frere Bernard.

351
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,416
England's soldiers have gathered
near the main road, and--.

352
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,416
Huh?

353
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,875
[laughing]

354
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,833
Does something ail you, Brother?
Are you feeling unwell?

355
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,833
[BERNARD laughing]

356
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:31,500
[GILBERT gasps]

357
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,500
[laughing continues]

358
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,000
[BERNARD]
The witch Maria.

359
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,833
Her damned soul is housed
within the purest of vessels?

360
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:44,250
God, forgive this world
such a blasphemous jest!

361
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:49,375
How fitting that the heretic
is a virgin named Maria!

362
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,083
[GILBERT]
Brother Bernard?

363
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,083
[ARTEMIS]
Hey, Maria!

364
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,375
Soldiers from the French army

365
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,208
are starting to congregate
near the main road.

366
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,250
Yeah.

367
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,750
So what's your command?

368
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:04,875
Nothing.

369
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,416
Hold on, you!

370
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,208
We poke around all damn day,
and this is the reply we get?

371
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,583
Yeah.

372
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,166
[ENGLISH SOLDIER A]
Keep walking, lads.

373
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,625
Put this bastard
land to our backs.

374
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,541
[ENGLISH SOLDIER B]
I miss my family.

375
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,791
[ENGLISH SOLDIER C]
Aye.

376
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,833
[ENGLISH SOLDIER D gasps]

377
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,375
[ENGLISH SOLDIER E]
An ambush?

378
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,500
[ENGLISH SOLDIER F]
It can't be!

379
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,125
[ENGLISH SOLDIER G]
How did they know?

380
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,166
Fire!

381
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,750
[ENGLISH SOLDIERS grunting]

382
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,333
Send these dogs down to hell!

[ENGLISH SOLDIER 6H]
Merciful God, help me!

386
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,750
[JOSEPH gasps]

387
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,333
[FRENCH HORSEMAN A]
Onward!

388
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:52,333
The flower of France shall lay
them low with hoof and blade!

389
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,458
In the name of our majesty,
King Charles!

390
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,041
[ENGLISH HORSEMAN A] Mewling
cowards, the lot of them!

391
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,291
Men of England!
Converge on that hillock!

392
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,291
What? They've artillery as well?

393
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,291
[YVAIN] Come on!
Let the daylight through 'em!

394
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,958
[GALFA chuckles]
Looks like We finally get to

395
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,583
bloody some Brits. Now you die!

396
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,916
[GUILLAUME] Bernard's plan
is going like clockwork!

397
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,250
At this rate, we'll push the
English dogs right into the sea.

398
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,958
Glory unto God
and Vive la France!

399
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,875
[FRENCH ORDINANCE]
Glory to the vanguard!

400
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,583
[FRENCH SPEAR COMMANDER A]
Could you march any slower?

401
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,041
Go, you dullards! Go!

402
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,375
Just One more battle.

403
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,958
Just one more battle
then we're done.

404
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,916
[ENGLISH SOLDIER I]
Run! It's a slaughter!

405
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,250
Whoa!

406
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,958
They had no idea France's
soldiers were coming!

407
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,166
Then, is this skirmish
the end of the war?

408
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,583
Looks like.

409
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,416
We'll have to earn
our gold another way.

410
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,166
[VIV}
Say...

411
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,208
[ALL]
Huh?

412
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,458
Where's Maria?
Isn't this her cue?

413
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,125
[ARTEMIS ] What do you
think's wrong with her?

414
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,958
[PRIAPUS]
I don't understand, Artemis.

415
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,000
[EZEKIEL sighs]

416
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,375
I'll have to... kill her?

417
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,875
No!

418
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,166
Maria!

419
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,458
I need to find you, right away!

420
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,500
[EZEKIEL gasps]

421
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,791
[JOSEPH] I know how
contrary it sounds, milady.

422
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,125
[gasps]

423
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,708
To bring us peace, a peace
that will truly endure,

424
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,416
the blood of the
English must be shed.

425
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,666
Can you suffer such a
thing to happen, though?

426
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,541
They sent you to
win my allegiance.

427
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,083
[JOSEPH gasps]

428
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,000
Forgive me.

429
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,750
No need to apologize.

430
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,958
I'm always at someone's
beck and call.

431
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:45,500
Every person I meet,
from noble to wretch.

432
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,541
Each has a goal that
lends them purpose.

433
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,000
A dream.

434
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,958
Like yours of ridding the
world of war, now and ever.

435
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:57,458
But when... I look within,
I see no such resolve.

436
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,583
All I do is deliver the
commands of stronger men.

437
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,916
[EZEKIEL sighs]

438
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,708
Buck up, Joseph.

439
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,625
Not everybody fosters
some grand ambition.

440
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,833
What do you want the most,
in your heart of hearts?

441
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,625
[JOSEPH] How fitting
you should ask me this.

442
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,583
My desire, since first we met,

443
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,833
is whatever dream will
have me at your side.

444
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:18,500
[MARIA]
Huh?

445
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,541
[EZEKIEL]
Huh?

446
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,916
[JOSEPH]
When I return from the war,

447
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,416
for I swear, return I shall,

448
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,166
then may I walk your path
to wherever it may lead us?

449
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,583
All provided that I turn a
blind eye to the battle ahead?

450
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,708
[JOSEPH]
Like I said. I'm sorry.

452
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,166
Lady Maria?

453
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,250
[MARIA]
You're so mean, Joseph.

454
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,375
[MARIA]
So mean.

455
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,916
[door creaks]

456
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,541
Take it.

457
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,666
[MARIA gasps]
All right.

458
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,166
[EZEKIEL] Ann brought
it for you yesterday.

459
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,000
You've been keeping to yourself,
so I couldn't pass it along.

460
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,166
[EZEKIEL]
She came because.

461
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,166
[MARIA]
Hm?

462
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,416
Ann's father has
been sent to fight

463
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,875
for the glory of
France yet again.

464
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,916
She wanted you to
intercede for him.

Huh?

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,791
Crawl closer and I
can shield us both!

[MARIA]
You're telling me? Why?

470
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,208
If not, she would have whined
till the Final Trumpet!

471
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,083
Me telling you changes nothing!

472
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,791
Know that my
mission is the same!

473
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,083
Your mission.

474
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,041
I have a mission as well.

475
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,875
And it's high time
that I saw to it!

476
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,000
[EZEKIEL]
Huh?

477
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:45,916
Think fast.

478

[EZEKIEL]
Uh...

479
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,750
[EZEKIEL grunts] Maria, I'm not
going to let you do this!

Are you nothing but
Heaven's mouthpiece?

481
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,583
I want to know what
you think, Ezekiel.

482
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,250
Huh? What I think matters not.

483
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,125
Duty compels me to--

484
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,916
[EZEKIEL yelps]
You threw me into a sack?

485

[PRIAPUS] Stay home
this time, all right?

You can't let her do this!

487
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,875
[EZEKIEL]
Let me out of here!

488
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,916
[grunting]
I'm deadly serious!

489
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,416
[EZEKIEL]
I'm deadly serious!

490
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,541
If you employ magic to change
the course of that battle,

491
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,416
all is lost!

She's a fine host!

yourself any friends being
