00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,375
[MICHAEL]
Tell me the truth, Maria,

2
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,208
have you really abandoned
the happiness of others

3
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,458
in the pursuit of your
own pleasure?

4
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,125
[MARIA laughs]

5
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:34,041
Hardly. Listen. I came to
learn something important

6
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,833
about the workings
of this world.

7
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,250
There was little point in my
trying to grant happiness

8
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,500
to others until I
found it for myself.

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,458
It's not about one or the other.
It's about attaining both.

10
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,916
What kind of reasoning is that?!

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,375
[MARIA]
You didn't say that I'm wrong.

12
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,291
This answer you
have given me.

13
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,916
Does it reflect your heart?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,333
Yes.

15
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:56,166
Nonetheless, you have continued
to rebel most brazenly

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,125
against the will
of the Almighty.

17
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,625
[JOSEPH gasps]

18
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:03,250
[MICHAEL] The balance of this
world must be maintained.

19
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,458
Archangel Michael.

20
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,000
I should have guessed.

21
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,458
Our love didn't get
much time to blossom.

22
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,750
I'll have the god of
wind fly you to safety,

23
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,083
so at least I know you're
well away from here.

24
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,083
But, what of--?

25
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,416
[MARIA]
Survive.

26
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,916
[MARIA gasps]

27
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
[ARTEMIS]
Maria!

28
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,916
[PRIAPUS]
Are you all right?

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,833
[MARIA]
How did you...?

30
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:00,666
[VIV]
Listen, love.

31
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,000
[MARIA gasps]

32
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,291
It'd be a bloody shame for
you to die mere moments

33
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,583
after you finally land a man.
Scamper off to some corner,

34
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,083
and let us take care of Michael.

35
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,333
[MARIA]
Wait, what?

36
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,333
You came all the way up
here just to say that?

37
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,250
[EDWINA] I just wanted
to stay at home, but no!

38
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,291
This feud's become a problem for
witches both near and far!

39
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,416
[RÉGLISSE]
Meow!

40
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,458
You don't mean to
say you're going to

41
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,916
lift your hand
against Michael!

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,125
[ARTEMIS]
You're not alone!

43
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,250
[PRIAPUS]
You've us as well!

44
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:24,791
What?

45
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,166
Please stop!

46
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,333
You cannot hold back the
whirlwind with mere numbers!

47
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,041
Only one...

48
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:29,875
...way to find out!

49
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:30,625
Give him a run...

50
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:31,541
...for his money!

51
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,625
[JOSEPH gasps]

52
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,000
[ALL]
Hear us, O matronly Rosmerta!

53
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,791
With Mercurius, lend your power

54
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,875
to we humble witches
of the hearth!

55
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:38,625
[EZEKIEL growls]

56
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,666
[gasps]

57
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,166
Just in time.

58
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,458
[BELLA] We heard that the Church
was giving Maria trouble.

59
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,041
Having more people
side with Michael

60
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,375
when it comes to witches
is the last thing we need.

61
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,833
They're gonna think
we're milquetoasts

62
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,208
if we don't fight back.

63
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,958
Don't look shocked
that we're here.

64
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:57,958
[MARIA]
What?

65
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,125
[BELLA]
You're stubborn as a mule,

66
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,375
but you're our mule,
for right or wrong.

67
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:01,875
[MARIA gasps]

68
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,125
[VIV laughs]

69
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,708
Witches and beasts
of time immemorial,

70
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,125
do you truly mean to throw
the world into disarray?

71
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:10,791
Piss off!

72
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,958
[EZEKIEL gasps]

73
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,500
[VIV] I'm sick to death
of this, Michael!

74
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:17,125
Stop nattering on about balance
and tell me what you think!

75
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,833
Viv. Perhaps you should
strike a lighter tone--

76
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,666
I want to know if there's a
brain in that head of yours.

77
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,083
Or are you a puppet?

78
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,166
Hold on! Peace, Michael!
Forgive her cutting words!

79
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,916
I don't want you getting
involved, all right?

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,541
Huh? But fighting for you is
the whole reason we're here!

81
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,125
[MARIA]
I know that!

82
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,666
But I hate battles, and this is
shaping up to be an epic one!

83
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,625
Good on you, holding
true to your ideals.

84
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,250
That said. I think there'll
be a fight either way.

85
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,333
[MARIA]
Huh.

86
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,583
Michael wait! Stand down!

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,833
[VIV]
Edwina?

88
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,625
[EDWINA]
Well, in for a penny!

89
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,791
You attack a herald of Heaven!

90
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,291
[CHANTAL] Tell him to leave
witches alone already!

91
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,958
Everyone, just stop!
I didn't want this!

92
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,500
[GILBERT] Brother Bernard,
we should be scouring

93
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,166
the countryside for those
damned heretics.

94
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,333
In light of Maria's escape.
I don't understand why

95
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,125
you're so eager to bring
your scrolls to the abbot?

96
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,375
[BERNARD]
What good is an epiphany

97
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,583
kept to one's self, Brother?

98
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,541
[BERNARD] With time enough
to ruminate upon this,

99
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,000
I believe we can come to
understand Almighty God

100
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,958
in an entirely new light.

101
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,708
[GILBERT]
"New light?"

102
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,500
[BERNARD] Gilbert, when we
naught but murmur the words of

103
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:35,000
old to our flock, have we served
our Father in good stead?

104
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,541
No. 'Tis a waste of our talents.

105
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:41,375
We are adept creations, and
to enfeeble ourselves is a sin.

106
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,416
We were granted
precious reason,

107
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,958
and the urge to
better ourselves.

108
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,666
[BERNARD] This precept, is
unique in the history of man.

109
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,041
The Heavenly Host is
a superfluous entity.

110
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,375
[GILBERT gasps]
What are you suggesting?

111
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,291
[BERNARD] Merely that
we are the masters here.

112
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,291
Earth is meant to reflect
our will, not that of God.

113
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,291
[GILBERT]
We, the masters?

114
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,000
[BERNARD]
Of course!

115
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,083
[GILBERT]
Brother!

116
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,250
[BERNARD]
Reasoning will be nurtured

117
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,291
with the irrationality
that God provides.

118
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,041
In a way, we can flourish even

119
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,375
without the divine
protection of God.

120
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,250
Who would've thought
that a witch would serve

121
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,625
as fulcrum to my
mind? Bless that girl!

122
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,375
I asked a painter to
immortalize her with his arts,

123
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,125
that all may know her! Maria!

124
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,125
[MARIA]
Viv! Edwina! 

125
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,375
[gasps] Joseph! What do you
think you're doing? Run away!

126
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:31,958
Never!

127
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,250
[MARIA gasps]

128
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:37,458
[JOSEPH] I remain!
Even at the cost of my soul!

129
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:41,125
[MICHAEL]
So be it. Ezekiel.

130
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,083
Transfix them both.

131
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,291
I cannot!

132
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,750
Spear of Heaven. You would
flout the will of God?

133
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:56,083
Master, you bade me watch,
and I have done so.

134
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,833
Whatever I've learned about
humanity and its virtues

135
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,041
during my time on Earth,

136
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,666
it is all thanks to
Maria's influence.

137
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,083
She's possessed of a
righteous heart, Master!

138
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,833
Ezekiel.

139
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:15,791
Tell me. Wherefore does this
heretic hold you in such thrall?

140
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,833
[bell tolls]

141
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,125
[MICHAEL]
Witch Maria.

142
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,375
Almighty God now demands
a reckoning of your deeds.

143
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,166
[gasps]

144
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,375
[EZEKIEL groans]

145
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,166
[MICHAEL] Any whom the
witch's acts have touched.

146
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,083
Heed my holy summons that
God may have His answer.

147
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,916
In your eyes,
what is this Maria?

148
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,875
She is a demon.

149
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,083
She steals my victories at
the cost of many a life.

150
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,291
She even lured my vassal Joseph.

151
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,583
[JOSEPH]
Milord Guillaume.

152
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,041
[GUILLAUME] Lord may
devils bear her hence.

153
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,583
[ENGLISH SOLDIER A]
Maria?

154
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,500
She's a useful ally, but when
she's your enemy, look out.

155
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,250
[FRENCH SOLDIER A]
She saved my life.

156
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,583
What's going on?

157
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,250
Archangel Michael is powerful.
He's giving voice

158
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,000
to the thoughts they
hold in their hearts.

159
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,208
Really? Impressive,
even for an angel!

160
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,500
Indeed. Their thoughts
are laid open before us

161
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,333
like the pages of a ledger.

162
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,166
We can hear them, but they
cannot hear us in turn.

163
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,333
[MARIA gasps]
That's amazing. Wow.

164
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,625
[VIV] He'd have drubbed
us no matter what.

165
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,541
[MARIA]
Viv?

166
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:32,333
[EDWINA]
So now you see reason!

167
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,000
[GALFA]
Huh? What do I think of her?

168
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,791
That girl is like
a slow death.

169
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,750
Everything worth a damn,
she ripped away from me.

170
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:43,333
My loot. Glory. My shield arm.

171
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,833
And the one man
I called my friend.

172
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:50,125
Believe me. I've had my
fill of her for a lifetime.

173
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:54,375
Soon as we get our pay from the
Count, we're shut of this place.

174
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,666
[GILBERT] The witch Maria
is a loathsome creature.

175
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,416
A harlot who dares to spit
in the face of our Lord!

176
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,041
When at last she's set ablaze...

177
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,750
[MICHAEL] I see. Bernard.
What is the witch to you?

178
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,291
[BERNARD whimpers]
It can't be.

179
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,958
The Archangel, made visible to
man, engaging in conversation.

180
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,333
This is... This is calamitous!

181
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,083
Bernard! The words you
speak are apostasy!

182
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,416
[BERNARD] This flies in
the face of my precepts!

183
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
For the sake of man's
advancement.

184
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,833
Humans must foreswear the
words of all but their fellows!

185
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,791
Not even angels
on high! No!

186
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,750
Not even the voice
of God. Himself!

187
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:29,750
Do not touch him!

188
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,458
Mankind!

189
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:35,208
Mankind doesn't
need you anymore!

190
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,208
Whatever the Church's position,

191
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,916
my opinion of Maria
is the same as that.

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,458
I don't know.
She did save the village.

193
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,166
Hard to see the evil
in a person like her.

194
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,666
[ANN] It doesn't matter
what anyone says!

195
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,000
'Cause! I like her!

196
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,500
And Artemis and Priapus
and Dovey, too!

197
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,541
The name's Ezekiel.

198
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,458
[MARTHA]
What is Maria to me?

199
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,041
[gasps]

200
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,333
She is a witch of great power,
as well as a treasured friend.

201
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,875
A witch can be so dear to you?

202
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,833
[MARTHA] Yes. Not just of
late, but over the many years.

203
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,208
We've argued, as
friends are wont to do,

204
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,791
but most of our time was spent
in laughter or in tears,

205
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,750
the likes of which one can
only shed in the company

206
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,125
of a boon companion like her.

207
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:30,791
And yet, like Peter,
I denied her.

208
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,500
But, the moment that stone left
my hand, I realized something.

209
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,208
Maria will always
be a part of my life.

210
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,958
She's woven up tight in
the tapestry of my heart.

211
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,666
[MARTHA] I know
you're listening, Maria.

212
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,000
I hope that you can
forgive me, dear.

213
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,583
I do!

214
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,708
[MICHAEL]
Speak, young man.

215
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:56,500
Many have borne witness,
but what is Maria... to you?

216
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,666
There, was a man.

217
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,250
A hermit, who lived
deep in the woods.

218
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,708
He spoke of a future
full of peace.

219
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,416
Pax Dei.
The Peace of God.

220
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,750
A man heard my voice
many years ago,

221
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,875
and sought to bring about
this world without conflict.

222
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,125
Huh?

223
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,000
[MICHAEL] Stand you as
inheritor to his dream?

224
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:31,125
So, he toiled in
service of Heaven.

225
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,291
France has been locked
in war since before my birth.

226
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:38,625
To my ear, a world at peace
rang true as a fairy tale.

227
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,583
Even if such a
thing could exist.

228
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,125
God seemed little inclined to
grant such ease to His children.

229
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,833
[VALKYRIE A]
He is stouthearted.

230
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:49,250
Should they die, he'll make a
fine addition to our ranks.

231
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,333
[JOSEPH] Yes. I let such
thoughts bedew my mind,

232
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,833
never once lifting a
finger in their service.

233
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:59,416
But then, I met a girl who
lived her convictions.

234
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,208
The scales have fallen from
mine eyes, Saint Michael.

235
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,000
I know now what I need to do.

236
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,166
I desire nothing more than
to champion such ideals

237
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,750
by her side.

238
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,500
Though we may leave these fair
environs far behind, we will--

239
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,250
--[ARTEMIS] Hm?
--[PRIAPUS] Huh?

240
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,583
[JOSEPH gasps]

241
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,166
[MARIA] What makes you think
I'm going anywhere?

242
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,000
But if you stay, the Church
may try to harry you further!

243
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,666
I'll not run. Not a chance!
It doesn't matter the cost.

244
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,500
I'll put an end to bloodshed
until the day that I die!

245
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,625
Michael's hearing every
word of this!

246
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,958
He could just decide to
kill you preemptively.

247
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,625
Speaking of! I've something
to say to you!

248
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,333
Whether I have
magic or not,

249
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,750
I'll stop every battle I come
across! I promise you that!

250
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,666
So if you're going
to smite me for that,

251
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,375
you might as well
do it right now!

252
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,791
Such a fool.

253
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,375
[MARIA] Y'know. I had some
time to mull things over,

254
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,958
being stuck in
a cell and all.

255
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,250
And I think maybe I'm starting
to see Heaven's point of view.

256
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,083
So. Give God a
message for me.

257
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,625
You let Him know, that just
this once, I forgive Him!

258
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,208
--[JOSEPH gasps]
--[EDWINA] You forgive?

259
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,166
I feel blasphemous but
hearing those words!

260
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,291
[MICHAEL]
Heh.

261
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,666
[EZEKIEL gasps]

262
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,666
[chuckles] You caught me
off-guard. That's very rare.

263
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,708
[MARIA laughs]

264
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,916
[VIV]
Michael laughed. Oh my God!

265
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,833
--[bell tolls]
--[ALL gasp]

266
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:21,125
For all of your irksome ways,
it seems you are now deemed

267
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,083
a part of the world's
natural balance.

268
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,708
The Heavenly Host will spurn
your words, and you, ours.

269
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,083
But know that it would gladden
our Father mightily if you and

270
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,041
He could exist in some
degree of understanding.

271
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,416
Of course, when you
threaten the balance

272
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,458
it remains my duty
to prevent you.

273
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:42,000
Mais oui. I'd hate for you
to have nothing left to do.

274
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,583
[MICHAEL] Hm. Thus I decree.
From this day forth,

275
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:50,916
the Heavenly Host shall think
upon Maria as a dear neighbor.

276
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,541
As such, we enjoin you all to
love thy neighbor as thyself,

277
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,250
and open your arms to her.

278
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:00,833
Heaven's injunction against this
child of magic has now ended.

279
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,125
[GILBERT gasping]

280
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,375
So, about that "neighbor" part.

281
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,833
[ARTEMIS] God forgives you.
That's the part that matters!

282
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:17,208
Oh, Maria! This
is such a relief!

283
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,833
[MICHAEL]
Ezekiel.

284
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,083
Master?

285
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,166
[MICHAEL] You have championed
a witch's cause,

286
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,583
in opposition to Heaven.

287
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,208
[EZEKIEL]
Yes, and my punishment?

288
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,291
This falls under
Gabriel's purview,

289
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,208
but God desires that I give
breath to His judgment.

290
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,666
Judgment? But she didn't--!

291
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,958
Hold your tongue.

292
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,875
[VIV] This is between the
Heavens and Ezekiel.

293
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,458
[MICHAEL] As one who has
fallen prey to free will,

294
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,541
you are fit to be
an angel no more.

295
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,250
You shall live as a human.

296
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:43,875
[EZEKIEL gasps]

297
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,375
[MARIA gasps]

298
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,041
[MICHAEL] Ezekiel, take what you
have learned of humanity,

299
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,750
and add to it as a
member of that which

300
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,500
you've grown to admire.

301
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,375
Almighty God offers
you a special kindness,

302
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,750
in exchange for your millennia
of unwavering fidelity.

303
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,875
You may choose your
mother-to-be.

304
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,458
[EZEKIEL gasps]

305
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,458
[ARTEMIS] Huh? She's
lookin' at you, Maria!

306
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,291
[MARIA]
Me?!

307
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,250
[ARTEMIS, PRIAPUS]
Mm-hm.

308
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,583
[VIV]
It's decided, then.

309
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,458
[MARIA] What? I can't just
be a mother! Right?

310
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,500
At least, you'd know
she's on the way.

311
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,000
[screams] So not only is God
pawning the dove off on me,

312
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,291
I'm going to lose
my powers as well?

313
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,916
If this is my forgiveness, I
prefer contempt, thank you!

314
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,583
[MICHAEL]
What say you, Ezekiel?

315
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,250
[MARIA] C'mon, Ezekiel! You
could do way better than me!

316
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,125
I don't want someone else.

317
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,583
[MARIA screams]

318
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,750
You'd let the poor dear be
born to some stranger woman,

319
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,916
is that it?

320
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,250
Well, it is the deal
everyone else gets!

321
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,458
Maria.

322
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,708
What about... you two?

323
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,916
I give up. Just know that I'm a
lot stricter than Saint Michael,

324
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,541
so you'd better not give me
any grief about it later.

325
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,000
You're gonna be
a cute baby.

326
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,916
[EZEKIEL cries]

327
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,958
See you soon, Mother.

328
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,458
[ARTEMIS]
Adieu for now, Ezekiel.

329
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,083
[PRIAPUS] Baby or not,
you had better remember us.

330
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,541
[MARIA]
Michael. Thank you.

331
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,833
[BELLA]
I guess we should be off, then.

332
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,458
[DOROTHÉE] Sorry to
have worn out our welcome

333
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,625
like this, Edwina.

334
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,458
[EDWINA] You can stay
longer, you know.

335
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,041
[SUZANNE]
Scared of Michael, are we?

336
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,666
Just because Heaven
forgave Maria

337
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,291
doesn't mean
we're in the clear.

338
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,666
Oh, come on. It's ages
since we attacked him.

339
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,125
I'm sure it's water
under the bridge.

340
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,375
If he meant to smite us,
he would've done so already.

341
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,375
[CHANTAL, DOROTHÉE]
Right?

342
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,666
[SUZANNE]
Shall we, ladies?

343
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,583
[RÉGLISSE]
Meow.

344
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,750
[VIV gasps]

345
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,333
[DOROTHÉE] We'll darken
your door again!

346
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,875
[EDWINA]
Be careful out there!

347
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,458
[CHANTAL]
You, too!

348
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,291
It was sort of pleasant having
the lot of them underfoot.

349
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,541
[VIV] I can't believe they
didn't tell me goodbye!

350
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,125
[EDWINA]
You slept too long.

351
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,375
I'm still getting over a spear
wound. It's a delicate junction,

352
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,750
you know. After I eat,
I'll be on my merry way.

353
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,291
The others are heading west,
if you want to try and catch up.

354
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,625
[VIV] Nothing doing, love.
England calls!

355
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,208
[EDWINA]
Huh?

356
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,750
[VIV] There should be a lot of
work for an enterprising witch,

357
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:02,375
right about now. Not to mention
lads to corrupt. Besides,

358
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,041
somebody should be striving
for peace over there.

359
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,416
[EDWINA] Peace is going
to be the death of us all.

360
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,875
[VIV laughs]

361
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,958
You think our Maria will keep
fighting the good fight?

362
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,666
[EDWINA]
How would I know?

363
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,000
She'll be all right.
After all, she's got him.

364
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,833
She's sorted, then!
Glad to hear it!

365
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,875
[GUILLAUME]
Are you serious?

366
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,250
[JOSEPH]
Yes. I serve a new master now.

367
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,291
I never believed that
you would slip off

368
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,166
to greener pastures
someday, Joseph.

369
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,291
But that look in your eye means
there's no dissuading you.

370
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,500
Huh?

371
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,583
[GUILLAUME]
Once you've made up your mind,

372
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,458
the Devil himself can't
hold you back.

373
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,791
Such willpower's a rarity
in one so young.

374
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,458
Milord, I... I don't
know what to say.

375
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,208
[sighs, chuckles]

376
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,375
God, you remind
me of your father.

377
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,458
I am forever in
your debt, sir.

378
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,833
[JOSEPH]
Le Comte said that we

379
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,500
should call upon him
from time to time.

380
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,166
[MARIA] 
Huh? Me as well?

381
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,083
[JOSEPH] 
Yes.

382
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,166
[MARIA] 
Are you sure about that?

383
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,375
[MARIA gasps]

384
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,125
[CERNUNNOS] Departing to
the world of humans.

385
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,708
[MARIA]
I am.

386
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,166
[CERNUNNOS] The mantle of a
witch suits you no longer, then?

387
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,208
[MARIA] Far from it.
I'm me, no matter what.

388
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,541
And for anything that
I give up in this life,

389
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,833
I gain at least that
much newness in return.

390
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,333
[CERNUNNOS] Such as?

391
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,625
Let's see. I've flown from place
to place for as long as I

392
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,000
can remember, but when walking,
it's an adventure!

393
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,166
That's but a single example.

394
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,583
The greatest adventure
is yet to come.

395
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:40,166
[CERNUNNOS] You will live as one
whose name is lost to history?

396
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,250
Yes. Thank you again.
For what you told him that day.

397
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,583
[MICHAEL]
Speak, thou ancient colossus.

398
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,625
What is the witch Maria to you?

399
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:53,000
[CERNUNNOS] I am of the past,
and she is of the future.

400
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,625
Her time will end, as
mine has, but for now,

401
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,125
purpose burns bright within her.

402
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,500
This world is naught but the
accretion of all who have

403
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,750
come and gone, each
leaving their mark in turn.

404
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,333
Your Yahweh reigns
ascendant, Michael,

405
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,375
but even He is not immune
to the turning of the wheel.

406
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:16,083
When Maria happens to think
upon me, the faintest of wind

407
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,500
sweeps through the dust
of what I've become.

408
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:22,166
Do not sever my
last link to life.

409
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,166
You care to give
village life a try?

410
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,250
I should think it'll
beat sitting out here

411
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,375
all by your lonesome.

412
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,666
[CERNUNNOS]
Thank you, Maria, but no.

413
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,750
It shall suffice that you
merely remember me.

414
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,458
[MARIA] Well, at least take
my cottage, would you?

415
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,166
I think a warm hearth
could do you some good.

416
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,958
[CERNUNNOS]
I will consider it.

417
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,000
[MARIA]
Then see you around, Cernunnos.

418
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,291
[CERNUNNOS]
Yes. I daresay you shall.

419
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,416
I wonder, Joseph, will they even
let me enter the village?

420
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,416
I think you worry
too much, Maria.

421
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,833
But what if they don't?
I mean--

422
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:05,750
[ANN]
Hey!

423
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,500
[JOSEPH, MARIA]
Uh?

424
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:10,875
[ANN]
Maria! Maria!

425
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,875
I was worried you wouldn't be
here in time for the festival!

426
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,041
Huh? So there's a
festival today?

427
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,666
[MARTHA] Indeed. It's your
favorite one, no less.

428
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,166
We're pleased to have you with
us, lad and you, my dear Maria.

429
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,208
Welcome home.

430
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,458
This is home!

431
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,625
[ANN] The English returned
to their island,

432
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,458
and at long last, the endless
warring was over.

433
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,666
This was all many years ago now.

434
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,708
Sure as they call me Ann,
I can tell you Maria and Joseph

435
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,666
lived out a happy
life in our village.

436
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,916
Her name was Maria, the
same as the Blessed Mother,

437
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,291
and as Heaven and
Earth both knew.

438
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,208
Maria was a witch.
