1
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,666
It's been too long, Uncle.

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,166
You've become quite a
man of the cloth, my boy.

3
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,250
You bring honor to the family.

4
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,125
[BERNARD] Would you care
for some apple cider?

5
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,208
It's our best.

6
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,333
Very well.

7
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,541
Now, what is this all about?

8
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:53,625
Uncle, you are both my blood and
Le Comte Guillaume as well.

9
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:58,041
I come to you as a petitioner
about the witch, Maria.

10
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,416
[sighs]
I should have guessed.

11
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,208
[GUILLAUME]
So, the witch.

12
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,166
[BERNARD]
Yes.

13
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,791
Her battlefield antics leave

14
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,541
the common folk feeling
unsure about the war.

15
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,916
[GUILLAUME]
She has been expanding

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,250
her sphere of influence.

17
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,500
[BERNARD]
You are a wise man, Uncle.

18
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,791
I'm sure a noble of
your great experience

19
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,958
has already weighed
the issue of Maria.

20
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,208
[GUILLAUME]
Indeed.

21
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,791
She sows chaos at every turn.

22
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,541
Meanwhile, the war
empties the King's coffers,

23
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,833
and he taxes us
all the worse for it.

24
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,458
[BERNARD]
And with every halted battle,

25
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,750
she drags us further
into this stalemate.

26
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,333
Without a clear victor
at the end of the day,

27
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,666
war is but a senseless butchery.

28
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,458
[GUILLAUME]
Well put, Nephew.

29
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:18,166
If only we could loose her
upon England's forces alone.

30
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,208
[gasps]
Oh yes, of course.

31
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,208
That's it.

32
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,291
[GUILLAUME]
Hmm?

33
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,333
[BERNARD]
We shall take this thorn,

34
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,375
and drive it into
our foe's side.

35
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,708
Will she obey?

36
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,333
[BERNARD] Surely not,
but if we feed her word

37
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,666
of England's maneuvers
deftly enough,

38
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,166
she'll think she acts
of her own volition.

39
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,166
[GUILLAUME]
Hmm. If she takes the bait,

40
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,791
wouldn't the peasantry love
her all the more for it?

41
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,541
[BERNARD]
They do not love her, Uncle.

42
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:45,041
They tolerate her,
because she serves a purpose.

43
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,416
End the war,
remove that purpose,

44
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,250
and they will cast her out.

45
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,208
Well, it's a bold gambit.

46
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,541
[BERNARD]
You are the man for it.

47
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,541
Huh?

48
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,750
[BERNARD]
She can weaken England,

49
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,791
but we'll need a
God-fearing noble,

50
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,541
a count, perhaps,
to deliver the coup de grace.

51
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,791
[GUILLAUME] Hm. And I
assume that's where I step in.

52
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,166
As faithful servant of the King
and stout-hearted Christian.

53
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,000
We appear at the endgame.
We crush the remnants

54
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,708
of England's forces and the
witch in one fell swoop.

55
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,125
[BERNARD]
Le Comte Guillaume,

56
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,541
only you can lead
the King to victory.

57
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,250
The heavens
themselves will sing

58
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,625
at the sight of this
most righteous deed.

59
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,583
Tis' a heady brew
you've poured me, Nephew.

60
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,583
But, I mean, would it
be acceptable?

61
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,208
The girl is a witch.

62
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,666
[BERNARD]
Get upon your knees.

63
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,500
[GUILLAUME]
Huh?

64
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,916
Please, my uncle.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,958
[GUILLAUME grunts]

66
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:41,458
Ego te absolvo. Your sins
are forgiven, and will be.

67
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,791
[GALFA] So, lost your
taste for the fight?

68
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,750
[JOSEPH] Le Comte
Guillaume has bade me serve

69
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,166
as messenger again.

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,666
Yeah, well, keep that
fancy gear handy.

71
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,541
[JOSEPH]
Huh?

72
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,791
[GALFA]
Take a look around.

73
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,250
[JOSEPH]
I see my lord's camp. Why?

74
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,250
[GALFA]
He's gathering mercenaries.

75
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,250
Rumor has it the ol'
Jew-sti-se himself,

76
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,166
Richemont, is going to
send in his ordinance.

77
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,666
Ain't that a pisser?

78
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,125
[GALFA laughs] And none of
this is news to you, right?

79
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,291
I, uh.

80
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,625
Hell, I know you'd
tell me if you could.

81
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,583
At the least we can finally
bloody their nose a bit.

82
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,666
[JOSEPH sighs] You keep an
ear to the ground, don't you?

83
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,083
[GALFA]
Damn straight.

84
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,833
Going into battle not knowing
what you're up against

85
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,375
is a good way to wind up dead.

86
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,375
Huh?

87
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,708
[GALFA]
Hey, if it's a good fight,

88
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,791
I can finally pay you back
those coins I borrowed.

89
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,083
No need. Honestly.

90
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,083
[GALFA]
Shut up. I'm gonna do it.

91
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,833
Hey.

92
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,000
[GALFA] For now, here's a
token of my thanks.

93
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,625
Uh, that really isn't necessary.

94
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:37,666
[GALFA]
Tell me.

95
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes?

96
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,833
When I was drunk, did I
tell you anything strange?

97
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,250
Uh, no, sir.

98
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,333
Well, nothing in particular.

99
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,583
Perfect.

100
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,041
[SUZANNE]
Say, Viv.

101
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,625
How did your talk with Maria go?

102
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,500
[VIV] Well, Rome wasn't
built in a day.

103
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,291
She's going to join
the guild, though, right?

104
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,791
That was the whole point of it.

105
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,666
She said she'd rather be alone.

106
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,583
No wonder she's not making
any headway with the gentlemen.

107
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,875
C'est vrai?

108
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,125
There is this one boy
who calls on her a lot

109
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,291
[RÉGLISSE meows]

110
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,666
You see? Even Edwina's
cat's in the know.

111
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,333
Half a moment, you're not
talking about Priapus, are you?

112
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,291
The poor lil' he-owl
without a beak?

113
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,666
I believe that he serves
one of the local noblemen.

114
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,875
Yeah?

115
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,500
The virgin's doing
pretty well for herself.

116
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,208
Is it me, or does
Joseph come by a lot?

117
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,208
And usually on horseback.

118
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,916
His master keeps
him busy, I guess.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,416
[ARTEMIS] Oui, even though
all the quarrels that he brings

120
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,750
are just petty ones,
They keep piling up.

121
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,083
[PRIAPUS] Getting through them
all still runs Maria ragged.

122
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,416
Hold on! She told me she was
stepping out for some air!

123
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
I get it! She's out
there meddling!

124
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,041
I was just kidding!

125
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,541
No way she could she do that
with you watching over her!

126
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,083
You really had me going
there for a moment.

127
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,500
[ARTEMIS]
Huh...

128
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,708
Another one. More minor
requests than ever.

129
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,125
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,000
I know Saint Michael has
forbade you to use your magic.

131
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,000
It pains me to tempt you thus,
but my lord commands me hither.

132
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,125
Please don't fret.

133
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,750
You were right to bring them.

134
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,416
[JOSEPH] Milady,
these petitions are minor,

135
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,916
but maybe we inch closer
to peace with each one.

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,625
I hope that you're right.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,166
--[JOSEPH] Also.
--[MARIA] Huh?

138
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,416
So, regarding Archangel Michael.

139
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,416
[MARIA]
Ugh.

140
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,666
[JOSEPH]
Any sign?

141
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,000
Pas de rien.

142
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,625
The world is tumultuous.

143
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,708
He's probably
forgotten all about me.

144
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,583
[JOSEPH]
Would that it were so.

145
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:32,833
Milady, if I may be of use
to you in any sort of regard,

146
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,041
you need but say the word.

147
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,666
Maybe I will.

148
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,333
By the way.

149
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,875
Go on.

150
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,083
[MARIA] Before, you mentioned
us inching closer to peace.

151
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,916
Once we finally
get there, then what?

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,291
My Lady?

153
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,791
[MARIA]
Are you dense?

154
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:57,333
I'm trying to ask you what
you want to do with your life.

155
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:01,791
It's funny. As of late,
people keep asking me that.

156
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,583
You see, I've served
Le Comte Guillaume

157
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:08,208
ever since I was a boy,
so this is all I know.

158
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,500
I suppose I would serve my lord

159
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,291
in times of peace,
much as ever I have.

160
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,375
Ah, I see.

161
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,333
[JOSEPH] One day, I will take
a wife, and have children.

162
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,750
Something like
Ann's family, like as not.

163
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,333
And what does the
future hold for you?

164
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,500
Hold on! For me?

165
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,666
[JOSEPH]
Yes.

166
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,833
More of the same,
I guess! I'm a witch!

167
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,000
It doesn't matter what's
going on in the world.

168
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,208
That's my role no matter what.

169
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,541
[ARTEMIS]
Watching these two fumble about

170
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,833
sets my talons on edge.

171
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,500
Oh? I find their
innocence quite endearing.

172
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,958
I believe she should
join with this boy

173
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,250
in holy matrimony and

You're wrong about me, Joseph.

346
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,333
I'm not strong at all.

347
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,541
Huh?

348
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,458
[MARIA] No matter
how many battles I stop,

349
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,041
the war continues.

350
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,458
Sometimes.

351
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,000
those whose lives I've
saved try to kill each other.

352
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,708
and I think, "What could
that possibly accomplish?"

353
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:24,916
[sighs]

354
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,375
But then, whenever
they look at me,

355
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,916
they're probably asking
themselves the same thing.

356
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,458
[JOSEPH]
Huh?

357
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,500
[MARIA] They see a girl who
keeps trying to stop the war.

358
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,375
I must bewilder them so.

359
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,041
It's such a conundrum.

360
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,541
One I'll have to get
figured out someday.

361
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,791
How can people
understand each other?

362
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,500
Who knows?

363
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,125
Yeah. All I can do
is believe in myself.

364
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,208
I think the same is
true of your friend.

365
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,583
And, really, it's true of
us all. Well, kind of.

366
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,750
How so?

367
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,750
Because, if you
make up your mind,

368
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,333
you stick to it!

369
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,458
You just put your head down and
keep at it until you're done!

370
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,416
Easy, right?

371
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,833
Ah, I do see what you mean.

372
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,708
[EZEKIEL sighs] Watching her
fumble through that moment

373
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,041
was so painful.

374
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,208
[ARTEMIS]
I think we're all.

375
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,000
[PRIAPUS]
Of one mind on that.

376
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,583
It's almost tomorrow.

377
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,458
Thanks for your help.
I know I was a burden on ya.

378
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,500
Don't be stupid, Galfa.

379
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:23,000
These days, there ain't much
I won't do for a flash of gold.

380
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,083
Speaking of gold, right now,

381
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,791
it's nine-to-one odds
you're going to lose.

382
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,708
That's a hell of a way
to make some money,

383
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,916
bettin' on a life. Ain't it?

384
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,041
[MERCENARY H]
Get to the fighting!

385
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,708
Will this really bolster
the mercenaries' morale?

386
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,875
If not, throw them some coins.
That should suffice.

387
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,083
[GUILLAUME]
Hm.

388
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,541
Will this fight truly
be to the death?

389
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,750
[BERNARD] The cavalry would
never have agreed to it if not.

390
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,916
Revenge cuts a better
figure when clad

391
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
in a mantle of pageantry.

392
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,166
[JEAN]
Hah! What a wretched opponent!

393
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,541
This victory will
bring me no honor.

394
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,833
If he's so wretched,
how come you're mounted

395
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,416
and wearing a full set of plate?

396
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
[ALL laugh]

397
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,708
[JEAN growls]

398
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,541
[YVAIN] Fetch the
knight a crossbow!

399
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,208
Then we'll see some heroics!

400
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,291
[JEAN]
Enough!

401
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,583
I deign to fight
on equal footing.

402
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:15,833
But, I still have two
good arms to his one.

403
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,500
[GALFA]
Mouthy bastard.

404
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,541
And if the mercenary should
somehow win, then what?

405
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,958
Come what may,

406
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,541
this trial by combat will
be the end of the matter.

407
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,333
You might last for
a moment, perhaps.

408
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,041
I did what I could.
Now it's on Galfa.

409
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,833
This will be good.

410
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,958
By the rights given to Le Comte
from the King of France,

411
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,333
this day, before God,
the knight Jean de Drouant

412
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:43,458
and the mercenary Galfa seek
your judgment via combat.

413
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,166
Step forward, each of you,

414
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,166
and lay your hand
atop the Bible.

415
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,958
State your petition,
to Heaven and Earth alike!

416
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,625
[JEAN]
Hear me, Galfa.

417
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,666
I swear, by the
words of our Lord.

418
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,166
I will avenge the
outrages of the flesh

419
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,583
you have wrought upon
my love, Eugénie.

420
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,958
Only by force have
you known her favor.

421
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,416
[GALFA] It's true enough
that I approached her,

422
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,000
but she shrugged out of her
clothes just as quick as I did.

423
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:07,833
You lie!

424
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,250
Gentlemen, please!

425
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,083
By the consent of both,

426
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,125
they give their
quarrel up to God!

427
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:17,250
Through this duel, the Heavens
will illumine the wronged party.

428
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,041
May the righteous man prevail!

429
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,208
I will serve as the official
witness of the duel to come.

430
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,208
Begin!

431
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,375
[yells]

432
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,416
[GALFA grunts]

433
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,208
[MERCENARY I]
Cut 'em to shreds!

434
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,958
[MERCENARY J]
Stop fooling around, Galfa!

435
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,458
Hurry up an' die already!

436
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,250
[FRENCH KNIGHT A]
No respect for dueling!

437
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,500
[FRENCH KNIGHT B]
They fight for pay.

438
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,750
Of course they're
lacking in piety.

439
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,583
[grunts]

440
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,291
Without his other arm,
he's got no chance.

441
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,458
He can't win.

442
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,416
[GALFA panting]

443
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,583

[grunts]

445
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,833
Ah! It looks as
though our problem's

446
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,458
about to be solved.

447
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,000
[VIV] You're not going to
stop the fight this time?

448
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,375
[MARIA]
Viv?

449
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,708
Maybe the one with the
hurt arm strikes your fancy.

450
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,041
Him? Of course not!

451
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,000
--[metal clangs]

452

[grunts]

453
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,500
Hey, friend. I got
a lot riding on this.

454
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,458
So, hurry up and die already!

455
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:18,000
[GALFA grunting]

456
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,500
Say, should some fights be
allowed to run their course?

457
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,208
[VIV]
Huh?

458
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,333
[JEAN, GALFA grunting]

459
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,458
Looks like the mercenary's
holding his own.

460
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,083
How odd.

461
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,125
Huh?

462
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,166
[grunts]

463
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,333
[gasps]

464
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,166
[FRENCH KNIGHT C]
Jean's victorious. Good.

465
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,250
It took long enough.

466
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,583
--Do it!
--Hey!

467
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,208
--Kill him already!
--That's it for you, Galfa!

468
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,291
[JEAN]
And now,

469
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,583
I split your worthless
face asunder.

470
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,166
Wait! Please, just don't!

471
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,041
I'm sorry! God, forgive me!

472
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,166
[JEAN] You have
acted like a beast.

473
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,750
Fitting, then, that you
shall die like one!

474
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:50,666
[gasps]

475
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,666
How could I have
been so blind?

476
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,416
[GALFA]
Go for the kill.

477
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,208
Swing that sword
as hard as you can!

478
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,166
You damn fool!

479
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,458
[JEAN]
It can't be!

480
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,708
--[GALFA yells]
--[JEAN grunts]

481
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,958
Tricky little bastard!
He swung his arm just in time!

482
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,041
That's our Galfa.

483
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,000
[GALFA chuckles]

484
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,416
What? A sword breaker?

485
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,833
[JEAN grunts]

486
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,458

Who's the beast now, huh?

[JEAN screams]

490
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,333
No. He'll kill him!

491
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:22,916
That's unexpected.

492
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,291
[JEAN, GALFA grunting]

493
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,458
Stop the duel!

[GILBERT]
Heaven has picked a champion!

496
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,416
Did I fulfill my obligation?

497
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,458
Tell me, damn you!

498
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,375
[CROWD cheering, booing]

499
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,625
What say you?
Did I give him a fight?

500
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,958
[cheering, booing continues]

501
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,083
Just look at 'em.

502
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,583
[LOLOTTE giggles]

503
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,916
Thank goodness.

504
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,958
[scoffs]
He shamed us all.

505
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,166
Yes, he did.

506
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,625
But now, all we can
do is bite our tongues.

507
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,625
And once again,
the Lord gives me

508
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:56,791
much proof that his will
is well-nigh inscrutable.

509
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,416
Rejoice, Galfa.

510
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,625
You will serve,
though you know it not.

511
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,083
[VIV] Tell the truth.
That fight down there.

512
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,000
You were about to
break it up, right?

513
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,333
[MARIA]
Obviously. Why?

514
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,291
[laughs]
God, you're adorable!

515
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,333
Huh?

516
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,083
[JOSEPH]
Are you all right?

517
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,875
[GALFA] Seein' as
how I had Yvain bet

518
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,125
all that money on
my long-shot win,

519
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,333
I've never been better, kid!

520
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,625
It's what I borrowed
and then some.

521
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,458
Guess I owe that
knight my thanks.

522
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,500
[gasps]
Haven't you heard yet?

523
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,875
Sir Jean de Drouant--

524
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,291
[GALFA]
He killed himself.

525
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,833
[JOSEPH]
Yes.

526
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,791
The jeering from his comrades
was more than he could bear.

527
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,458
[GALFA] That's what comes
from caring what people think.

528
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,250
[JOSEPH] His lady seems
to have disappeared

529
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,791
in the wake of all this.

530
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,375
[GALFA]
Hmm.

531
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,625
[JOSEPH]
Do you know where she's gone?

532
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,000
And why the hell
would I know?

533
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,333
Sure ain't like we
pledged our troth.

534
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,916
She probably went
back to her homeland.

535
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,666
I do remember her saying
how beautiful it was there.

536
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,916
That kind of girl,
she should have never

537
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,083
come to a place like this.

538
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,791
I wonder if it's so
different there.

539
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:02,916
Tell me something.

540
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,041
Uh-huh?

541
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,250
Earlier.

542
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,750
I wanna know who you
bet on to win the duel?

543
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,666
Huh? As witness,
I couldn't wager.

544
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,916
[GALFA] Yeah, fine,
but what if you had?

545
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,166
I would've put it
all on you, Galfa.

546
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,500
You gotta learn how
to lie better, kid.

547
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,916
You're the one who said I
should run away, remember?

548
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,125
[JOSEPH]
Ah... You're right.

549
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,166
[GALFA]
Uh-huh.

550
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,291
"Hang on tight" doesn't
mean to smother me!

551
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,375
It's really a bother.

552
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,875
As I learn more,
I will pass it along.

553
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,458
[MARIA]
You're so mean, Joseph.

554
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:05,333
Glory unto God
and Vive la France!
