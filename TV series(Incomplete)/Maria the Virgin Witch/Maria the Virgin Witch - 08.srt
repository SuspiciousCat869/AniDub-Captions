00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,916
More blood will be spilt.

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,166
[gasps]

178
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,416
[GALFA] You see, rumors
fly about my camp, boy.

179
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,000
Rumors?

180
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:38,083
[GALFA] Everywhere I turn, each
whisper is of Maria the witch.

181
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,250
The cause of our defeat.

182
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,500
[JOSEPH]
But, Galfa!

183
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,166
[GALFA] What? You gonna
convince 'em she ain't?

184
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,333
Go tell the witch
to keep to her wood.

185
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:48,458
If she's smart, she'll lay low
till this anger burns down.

186
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,791
[LOLOTTE]
Aw, look at you.

187
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,666
Taking that poor little
chick under your wing.

188
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,791
Under my wing?
You think I... like him?

189
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:58,750
Yeah.

190
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,000
[GALFA]
Why d'ya say that?

191
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,416
Don't you gimme that look!

192
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,916
[GALFA]
Heh.

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,625
[LOLOTTE] No matter, then.
Just keep the troupe in coin.

194
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,291
Captain Galfa.

195
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,833
Filthy lucre makes
the world go 'round.

196
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,416
[GALFA scoffs]
Stop acting like my wife.

197
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,083
[PRIAPUS]
Joseph!

198
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,500
[JOSEPH gasps]

199
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,625
[PRIAPUS] Thank goodness.
I've been looking for you.

200
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,791
Please, come! We need
you at Maria's right away!

201
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:22,833
What?

202
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,833
You need to help
us keep her calm.

203
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,708
I hurry homeward with news
she won't want to hear.

204
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,458
Ah. Then I know well
your trepidation.

205
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,833
Truly, Joseph?

206
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,166
Yes. I was on my
way out to see her.

207
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:47,208
[labored breathing]

208
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,500
They think what?!

209
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,083
How dare they accuse me
of such villainy?

210
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,583
For years I've cared for
Martha and that village!

211
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:55,625
[PRIAPUS]
I-I know, but--

212
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,166
[MARIA]
Me, poison Martha?

213
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,541
The words curdle upon my tongue!

214
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,500
Master. Patience! Please!

215
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,791
Those herbs they malign
have been keeping her alive!

216
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,333
Oh, damn those liars!

217
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,625
They're lucky
I'm such a pacifist,

218
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,875
or there would be hell to pay!

219
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,416
Maria stop!
I share in your pain.

220
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,541
[MARIA]
Huh?

221
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,166
[JOSEPH]
But you must be at ease.

222
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,250
But they're lying!
I would never poison--!

223
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,375
We know, and I'm sure
that Ann does, too.

224
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,916
However, what that monk
said is frightening her.

225
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,416
[MARIA grunts]
Understood.

226
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,625
Where are you going?

227
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,666
To the village.

228
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,250
Really?

229
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,333
By now, I'm sure the village
wants nothing to do

230
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,791
with the heretic Maria.

231
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,541
You barging in will only make
things worse for Martha.

232
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,500
[MARIA]
Make them worse? How?

233
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,000
[JOSEPH]
Unfortunately, Artemis is right.

234
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,208
And it's not only that village.

235
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,333
Misunderstanding is
quick to take wing.

236
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,708
[MARIA gasps]

237
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,083
[JOSEPH] While I don't
believe they would harm you,

238
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,333
it may be best if
you stayed silent.

239
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,541
Just for a time.

240
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,541
[MARIA]
Tell me why?

241
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,625
Why do they all just
assume the worst?

242
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,000
All I've ever wanted was--!

243
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll tell you what
they would say!

244
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,916
In their eyes
you are a heretic.

245
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,166
Heretic?

246
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,458
I halt their wars,
and heal their afflicted.

247
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,458
And for that, I get only hate?

248
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,958
That's crazy!

249
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,000
All that you give them
are the things that

250
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,208
no mortal should be
able to grant another.

251
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,291
Some of them do think this.
You have been denied before.

252
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,375
[MARIA gasps]

253
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,416
Hey!

254
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,291
So you know,
about that village.

255
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,500
Um, well I--

256
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,541
No matter how you
may wish for it,

257
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,791
the truth cannot be changed.

258
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,791
You are naught but
a heretic to them.

259
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,541
[MARIA sighs]

260
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,000
The people there
don't understand you.

261
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,916
They will always throw stones.

262
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,875
They're scared. The Church
keeps them that way.

263
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,875
That's why...

264
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:47,708
[MARIA gasps]

265
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,958
[EZEKIEL]
That's why...

266
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,458
time after time they
will turn against you!

267
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,208
They've been raised to fear you!

268
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,125
It doesn't matter
what you do for them!

269
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,708
You're no better!

270
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,791
You know what Heaven
demands of you!

271
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,583
We could all be
on the same side!

272
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,416
But you're so stubborn!

273
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,083
I don't want you
to end up alone!

274
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,875
I can't help it!

275
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,500
It's who I am.

276
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:16,291
[EZEKIEL sobs]

277
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,000
[JOSEPH]
I must return to Le Comte.

278
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,250
[MARIA]
Right.

279
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,708
Milady.

280
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,250
I've seen the good
you do firsthand.

281
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,208
Far more than the
Church has seen.

282
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,500
I know what you do is right.

283
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,375
Even if the world
condemns you,

284
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,250
I have never
doubted you, milady,

285
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,375
and I never will.

286
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,958
[gasps]

287
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,500
Trust in the path you've chosen,
never stray from it.

288
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,291
Though foes may dog your steps.

289
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,958
I am here.
I will always be.

290
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,125
[gasps]

291
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,541
[JOSEPH]
I will never abandon you.

292
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,541
'Til next time.

293
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:02,750
Thank you.

294
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,416
I, uh...

295
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,708
L-Lady Maria?

296
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,625
[gasps]

297
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:24,708
[MERCENARY B growls]

298
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,708
Galfa, I know you slew Yvain!

299
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,625
[LOLOTTE]
Did you really, Galfa?

300
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,916
Guess he didn't do it.

301
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,333
[MERCENARY B]
Tch. I thought as much.

302
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,583
Look like I'll be feedin' two
traitors to my zweihander!

303
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,958
You got greedy.

304
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,500
And I see you for
exactly what you are.

305
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,500
A serpent.

306
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,916
That so?

307
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,458
Trouble with serpents is
they can't hold onto anything.

308
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,041
Kind of like you.

309
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,166
If there's one thing I cannot
abide, it's a Judas at the helm!

310
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,500
[LOLOTTE] Aahh!
Have you lost your mind?

311
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,041
You'd kill you own captain?

312
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,208
[MERCENARY B]
Why the hell not?

313
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,083
It's no worse than
what he did to Yvain!

314
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,833
You'd cut me down just to lord
over a bunch of sell-swords?

315
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,375
If you think you're
man enough for it,

316
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,625
come over here and put that
sword through my heart.

317
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,125
Lolotte. Open it.

318
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,375
[LOLOTTE grunts]

319
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,750
Fool woman.

320
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,125
You'll never ready
a firearm in time.

321
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,916
[gasps]
What the--?

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,875
Galfa, what the
devil is that thing?

323
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,208
Now, you can go
crawling back to camp,

324
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,333
or I can leave your bloodied
corpse out here for the animals.

325
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,541
[MERCENARY B chuckles]
I could never serve you!

326
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,291
[GALFA]
Thought so.

327
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,541
Fine, I'll climb over you, too.

328
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,375
[ARTEMIS] I put Ezekiel to
bed when she stopped crying.

329
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,500
[MARIA]
Thanks. Where's Priapus?

330
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,833
I think he left to check
the rumors in town.

331
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,208
[MARIA]
Ah.

332
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,208
So, tell me, are you
still a maid?

333
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,916
What?! Who just says that?

334
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,500
Well, you took your sweet
time bidding him adieu.

335
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,916
I thought you had
your way with him.

336
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,583
We did no such thing!

337
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,083
No, I guess not.
If you'd done the deed,

338
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,000
you'd be standing differently
right now, Master.

339
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,166
You're a bad owl!

340
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,458
[ARTEMIS laughs]
It's odd, huh?

341
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,291
For a long time
this place was quiet,

342
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,916
with only the two
of us living here.

343
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,541
And now there's some sort of
excitement almost every day.

344
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,208
You know?

345
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,333
Yeah, you're right.

346
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:19,083
[ARTEMIS] Listen.
Ezekiel, Joseph, Priapus, me.

347
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,625
We all want the best for you.

348
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,583
You just stay at home and put
your focus into getting better.

349
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,791
I'll go out, and do what I do.

350
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,000
[MARIA chuckles]

351
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,541
[ARTEMIS]
And while I'm at it,

352
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,666
I'll painfully do what I do
to those who speak ill of you.

353
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,083
Artemis!

354
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,375
[ARTEMIS]
Huh? This smoke!

355
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,250
[MARIA]
What do you want, Cernunnos?

356
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,875
Wait. You know it?

357
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,041
[CERNUNNOS]
Witch Maria, you bore witness

358
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,583
to the northern clan.

359
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,500
I did. You know them?

360
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,500
[CERNUNNOS]
In time long past.

361
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,125
They are but shadows
of their ancestors.

362
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,458
Faded in their weakness.

363
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,666
Well, you look a
bit faded yourself.

364
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,083
[CERNUNNOS] Your familiar
speaks the truth.

365
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,416
Goodness. Aren't we honest?

366
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,375
[CERNUNNOS]
A hollow existence is the fate

367
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:06,541
that befalls all of our kind.
It doth rest upon me.

368
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:11,291
Doth rest upon that northern
clan and thee, witch.

369
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,416
Speak for yourself!

370
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,541
[CERNUNNOS]
The fateful hour is nigh.

371
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,875
[MARIA gasps]

372
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,500
[CERNUNNOS] The people
will carve your kindnesses

373
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,833
out of their memories and
turn their backs upon thee.

374
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,541
They will forget
all that we were

375
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:27,000
with surprising ease, sorceress.
And they more the fools for it.

376
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,083
But...

377
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,583
Why even come here?

378
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,333
Away with you, beast!

379
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,500
[CERNUNNOS] Witch Maria,
why rush to their aid?

380
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:38,125
Why intervene in humankind's
futile struggles?

381
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,833
[MARIA gasps]

382
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,583
[CERNUNNOS] Become one
with us, swear unto us--

383
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,458
Get you gone!

384
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:01,125
[LOLOTTE grunts]
Come now. Off with ya!

385
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,666
That's a lovely toy, Galfa!

386
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,166
[GALFA]
Heh. Indeed.

387
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,500
I can certainly get up to
some trouble with this.

388
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,875
Ah. So this is the place.

389
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:17,958
[GILBERT]
Yes.

390
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,416
They say that the
Archangel Michael

391
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,041
descended upon this very spot.

392
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,541
If only we could
have borne witness.

393
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,291
Blessed be mine eyes.

394
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,500
Yes. Would that we had.

395
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,458
The honored Brother Bernard
has at last come among us.

396
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,833
You do us a great honor, sirrah.

397
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,416
[BERNARD]
I am but a humble servant.

398
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,083
It is at the name of Jesus
that every knee shall bend

399
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,708
[VALKYRIE A]
See how the Church of the World

400
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,500
gluts itself upon empty words.

401
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,166
Martha, can you hear me?

402
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,541
[MARTHA]
Yes.

403
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,166
I feel I am growing better
with each passing hour.

404
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,833
[BERNARD]
These are glad tidings.

405
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:59,125
Thanks to your medicine, Brother
Bernard, I am still alive.

406
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,625
Martha, I can take no credit.
It was the will of God.

407
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,416
[ANN whimpers]

408
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,666
Know you this.

409
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,708
I've never seen anyone
regain their strength

410
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,416
with speed such as this.

411
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,375
Your recovery may indeed
count as a miracle.

412
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,458
[BONNE, DENIS gasp]

413
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,583
Could it be so?

414
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:18,166
The Lord Above has granted
me more time in this life?

415
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,666
[BERNARD]
I am told all is not well.

416
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,583
You have been treated
with false medicines

417
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,208
at the hands of a witch.

418
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,083
[ANN gasps]

419
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,291
[MARTHA gasps]
But, she...

420
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,458
[BERNARD] Witches are
the most cunning of liars.

421
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,375
They worm their way
into your heart,

422
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,291
but their promises
are naught but dust.

423
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:38,083
Will you sever ties to her,
this creature of inequity?

424
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,708
Will you renounce her in
word and in deed evermore?

425
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,458
[MARTHA gasps]
Evermore?

426
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,500
[ANN gasps]

427
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:50,000
To tender with a witch is
unbefitting the children of God.

428
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,833
[MARTHA sighs]

429
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,875
[BERNARD]
Even now. God is merciful.

430
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:58,500
Martha, will you confess
your sin before the Almighty?

431
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,500
For the sake of your family.

432
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,083
[MARTHA]
I shall confess.

433
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,458
[BERNARD]
Begin.

434
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:16,541
God above, I confess
my sins to thee.

435
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:20,041
I have sinned against you
and your church on Earth.

436
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,708
I have fraternized with a witch.

437
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,583
Was it the witch
Maria, my child?

438
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,541
I pledge to thee.

439
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,500
The Witch Maria shall
never have my heart.

440
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,125
This I pray.

441
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,291
[ANN]
Grandmother?

442
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,041
[BERNARD]
Ego te absolvo.

443
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,750
Your sins have been forgiven.

444
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,666
Amen.

445
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,666
[bells ringing]

446
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,916
[BERNARD]
Mark me!

447
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,666
The insidious presence
of the witch named Maria

448
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,625
sows naught but
confusion and death.

449
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:54,083
Perhaps you wonder why
she would treat us ill.

450
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:58,291
She is a witch and sworn to
deliver chaos in her wake.

451
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:02,166
In her words, she brings
peace to our war-torn homeland.

452
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,625
But by quelling war,
she lengthens it,

453
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,791
and makes herself indispensible.

454
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,208
She profits by the discord
she claims to loathe.

455
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,875
The witch is clever, you see.

456
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,875
She clings to our dream
of peace, like a leech.

457
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,708
We shall achieve it with the
unyielding strength of our faith

458
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,458
and labor drawn out
of our own hands.

459
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,666
We need no witches to aid us.

460
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,375
They must be forgotten.

461
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,333
All witches must
fade from our memory.

462
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,791
Put your trust in
God's Holy Church.

463
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,375
Let the witches,

464
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:37,000
who stand opposed to order and
light never again see the sun.

465
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:41,000
Children our Brother Gilbert
here, blessed be he,

466
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,875
has been named a magistrate
of the Inquisition.

467
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,458
[gasps]

468
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,791
[BERNARD] May the power of his
pure faith return this village,

469
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:51,625
and its people, to the glory
of our Holy Father.

470
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:55,916
Let all of us walk in
the light of Christ our Lord.

471
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,541
Amen.

472
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,625
[BERNARD]
Bonne chance to you, Gilbert.

473
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,458
[GILBERT]
Ah, but Brother.

474
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,416
I do not deserve this,
flawed as I am.

475
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,958
Purity of purpose
has brought you here.

476
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,458
Trust in it.

477
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,583
I shall do all I can.

478
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:34,541
Once her purity is lost,
so too, then, is her magic.

479
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,333
You told me yourself, Galfa.

480
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,791
It matters not the
how or the wherefore.

481
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,541
With her virginity sundered,
she can harry us no longer.

482
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,166
Are you really telling
me to do this?

483
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,875
[BERNARD] It would make
a fitting revenge.

484
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,583
For all that she's
taken from you.

485
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,708
Brother, you're the Devil.

486
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,791
[BERNARD] The Devil
resideth in each of us.

487
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:00,083
Only the Lord can
keep him at bay.

488
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,416
I have prepared
a special incense.

489
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,250
I'll leave the
particulars to you.

490
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,875
Of course. I am not
versed in such things.

491
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,083
[MARIA]
When did it start?

492
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,791
How did I become so dedicated
to stopping battle?

493
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,666
[MARIA]
What am I trying to achieve?

494
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,875
[BERNARD] Is irrationality
the reason we need faith?

495
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,875
But Aristotle said
affirmation and negation

496
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,291
cannot both be true at once.

497
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,708
Ergo. Ergo. No, wait!

498
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:04,125
Is consideration of the
unchanging as a premise

499
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,083
wrong from the onset?
