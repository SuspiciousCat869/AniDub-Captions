00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,583
[ANN] My story is set
in the olden days,

2
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,916
when we of France were
still at war with England.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,666
There was a young witch
living near our village,

4
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,666
who hated wars with every
beat of her fiery heart.

5
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,291
The witch plied no trade in
curses, or hexes, or evil deeds.

6
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:44,416
Instead, she sought to end all
conflict by sheer force of will.

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,291
Her name was Maria.

8
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,291
The same as the Blessed Mother.

9
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:53,916
And just like her holiest of
namesakes, Maria was a virgin.

10
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,416
[ARTEMIS]
Let her be.

11
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,833
Rest is good for what ails her.

12
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:43,916
[PRIAPUS]
Right.

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Her magic is still
on the mend, also.

14
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,333
[EZEKIEL]
Um...

15
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,416
[ARTEMIS]
Huh?

16
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,041
Is it my fault Maria's heart

17
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,375
is so burdened with
disappointment right now?

18
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,916
Stop blaming yourself.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,458
Maria thinks the world of you.

20
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,625
[ARTEMIS] I'll return once
I've finished my duties.

21
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,208
I won't be long.

22
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,625
[EZEKIEL] I have an errand
to run, as well.

23
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,083
[PRIAPUS]
What kind?

24
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,291
Seeing Joseph may help to
bolster her battered spirit.

25
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,833
[PRIAPUS] Well, then.
Lead the way.

26
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:07,875
Huh?

27
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,375
An owl can see
better in the dark.

28
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,625
If we go together.

29
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,375
We can return
before she's awake.

30
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:16,291
Thank you. Then, I accept.

31
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,916
[PRIAPUS]
Great.

32
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,250

00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,875

[MARIA grunts]

35
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:20,500
Chased by Saint Clements
of Metz, answer...

36
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:26,166
answer the call of this witch of
the hearth, and show yourself.

37
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,500
Come Graoully now!

38
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,125
[GRAOULLY squawks]

39
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,000
It's you.

40
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,208
[GRAOULLY squawks]

41
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,125
I should've waited longer!

42
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,833
[GALFA groans]

43
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:41,666
[GRAOULLY squawks]

44
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,375

[MARIA gasps]

47
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,291
[GALFA laughs]

48
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,416
[MARIA] Chased by
Saint Clements of Metz....

49
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Ah!

50
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,166
[MARIA]
H-He means to--!

51
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,416
[MARIA groans]

52
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,083
W-Winds of Njord.

53
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,958
[MARIA whimpers]
Tell me... why.

54
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,250
[GALFA]
Quiet, or I'll take your tongue.

55
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,541
[MARIA gasps]

56
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,791
[GALFA]
I wonder.

57
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,458
How many men are dead
because of your magic?

58
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,666
Let's see how...
you like my magic.

59
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,416
[MARIA]
Guardian of the earth.

60
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,916
Njord.

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,166
S-Summon, summon.

62
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:42,958
[MARIA whimpers]

63
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,375
[GALFA]
You'll thank me for this.

64
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,250
[PRIAPUS hoots]

65
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,750
Bastard! Don't touch her!

66
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,458
[GALFA grunts]

67
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,166
[EZEKIEL gasps]
Maria!

68
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,666
[PRIAPUS yells]

69
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,375
You do that again, and I swear
to Christ I'll cut you in half.

70
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:14,708
Chased by... Saint
Clements of Mets...

71
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,625
Answer the call... of this
w-witch of the hearth...

72
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,041
and show yourself!

73
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,375
Graoully, attack Him!

74
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,583
[GALFA]
Uh?!

75
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,500
[MARIA]
Uh. Graoully, attack!

76
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,208
Huh?

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,125
There's nothing.

78
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,583
[GALFA]
Can't use it, can ya?

79
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,666
[gasps]

80
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,583
Guess your magic's...
not all ya lost.

81
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,208
[laughs]

82
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,125
[GALFA]
Ya hear that, world?

83
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,000
Do ya?

84
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,375
Maria can't use magic anymore!

85
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,458
She traded one
staff for another!

86
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:57,541
[GALFA laughs]

87
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:02,666
Everybody, make sure you
partook of the antidote.

88
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,791
[MARIA]
Both of you need to leave.

89
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:05,791
[EZEKIEL]
What?

90
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,166
[MARIA whimpering]
This evil air...

91
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,166
It's going to overpower you.

92
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,583
So go.

93
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,333
There's still enough time
for us to escape together!

94
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,416
Look at me.
I can barely stand up.

95
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,000
[PRIAPUS]
Maria.

96
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,250
[EZEKIEL] There must be
something we can do.

97
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:26,083
[MARIA] Now, take this.
They mustn't have it.

98
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,250
[GILBERT]
Hark, sorceress.

99
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,541
You have been accused of heresy,
and by order of the Holy Church,

100
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,125
will face its judgment.

101
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,958
[GILBERT]
Load her into the wagon.

102
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,958
[JOSEPH]
Galfa? At this hour?

103
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:46,750
[GALFA]
Well met.

104
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,583
[JOSEPH gasps]

105
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,666
[GALFA]
Like it?

106
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,458
It's what you brought
me in that box.

107
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,750
Well, it's a fearsome proxy.

108
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,000
I just hope it serves you
in good stead, my friend.

109
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,875
Oh. Don't you worry. It does.

110
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,291
[JOSEPH]
That's good to hear.

111
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,375
By the bye,
where are you headed?

112
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:05,083
Priapus bade me bring some
cheer to Maria, so I...

113
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,333
Did I offend?

114
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,375
[GALFA]
Go home.

115
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,666
It's late.

116
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,583
[gasps]

117
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:20,458
[INQUISITION SOLDIERS]
Burn her!

118
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,416
[JOSEPH]
Lady Maria!

119
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,333
Lady Maria!

120
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,208
She's not here anymore!
They took her away.

121
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,291
Took her?! Who?!

122
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,666
What happened here, Priapus?!

123
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,791
[JOSEPH]
Galfa...

124
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,375
He couldn't have.

125
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,791
[EZEKIEL] Priapus saw him, and
then the Church carted her off.

126
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,791
[ARTEMIS] What's that about
the Church carting her off?

127
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,083
Do they have Maria? Answer me!

128
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,875
Yes. She made us leave her!

129
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:10,916
[JOSEPH]
Galfa.

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,958
[PRIAPUS]
Huh?

131
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,208
[JOSEPH]
He robbed her of her virtue,

132
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:19,625
and he did it... with the
very arm... I brought him.

133
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,583
[JOSEPH screams]

134
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,583
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Before the
Church and Almighty God,

135
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:41,041
I swear that I saw that girl
fraternizing with demons!

136
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,250
[DENIS]
I, uh...

137
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:43,916
[FRENCH VILLAGE CHIEF]
Yes?

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,291
[ANN whimpers]

139
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,041
I swear before the Church
and Almighty God.

140
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,083
I did, too.

141
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,416
[cries]

142
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,458
By their words, your
blasphemous acts of sorcery

143
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,583
have been dragged into
the blessed light of day.

144
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,291
In the name of the Pope,
the Vicar of Christ on Earth,

145
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,208
you will be remanded
to the Church,

146
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,458
that it may gauge your guilt.

147
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,791
This isn't a good place
to mount a rescue.

148
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,875
The last thing we need
is for Ann's family

149
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,250
to get hurt in the process.

150
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,291
Damn that Galfa.
How in the world did he learn

151
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,250
Lady Maria's secret
to begin with?!

152
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,833
The fault lies with me.

153
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,041
[ALL gasp]

154
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,750
I couldn't've known
what it would lead to.

155
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,875
Punishing yourself
won't help Maria.

156
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:22,875
But, I...

157
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,458
I find it sadly ironic

158
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,541
that in a village blessed by the
sight of the Archangel Michael,

159
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,208
your salvation has flickered
like a guttering candle

160
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,875
in this unholy witch's wake.

161
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,625
Thankfully, your mustard seed's
worth of faith has endured.

162
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,500
The Lord has freed
an elderly woman

163
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,250
from the clutches of infirmity,

164
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,125
and the witch will be offered
a chance at repentance.

165
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,750
I pray God she shall not
squander this gift.

166
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,375
Lend me your aid, good Martha.

167
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,541
You were seduced by the
witch's forked tongue,

168
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:54,791
but you have returned to the
flock as devout as anyone here.

169
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,041
For the sake of your
family, whom your sin

170
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,291
did so foully taint. I'd
like you to prove here,

171
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:04,583
before God and man alike that
you rebuke this fallen wretch.

172
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,625

--[BONNE] Mais oui.

What's wrong, Grandmother?

175
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,458
Grandmother, no!

176

00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,458

00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,125
[ANN gasps]

179
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,875
[MARTHA cries]

180
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,250
[BERNARD] Tears shed for a
witch are tears but wasted.

181
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,125
Let us rejoice that Martha,
our sister in Christ,

182
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,416
has rebuked the devil in our
midst and given herself to God.

183
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,000
[ANN wails]

184
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,875
[ARTEMIS]
Ezekiel.

185
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,291
[EZEKIEL]
Yes.

186
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,166
[BERNARD] This village
is pleasing to God.

187
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,000
His blessings upon you!

188
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,000
[bell tolls]

189
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,500
[EZEKIEL] Why did I speak
to that horrible man?!

190
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,000
[ARTEMIS]
What's done is done!

191
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,541
Right now, we need to
focus on rescuing Maria.

192
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,708
Stripped of her magic,
she's defenseless.

193
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,583
[JOSEPH]
Is she, though?

194
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,708
[EZEKIEL]
Uh?

195
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,916
If her magic were
irretrievably lost,

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,541
wouldn't Artemis and Priapus
lack the means by which

197
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,041
to retain their human forms?

198
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,083
[ARTEMIS gasps]

199
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,041
That's right.
We'd be owls again!

200
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,291
That means Maria--

201
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,791
Is still a virgin?

202
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,333
It's hard to know.

203
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,500
But, I'll cling to any
hope that her purity

204
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,958
hasn't been taken from her.

205
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,166
[ARTEMIS] I see. So the
fact that her familiars

206
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,500
are able to stand
here in human guise

207
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,791
means that her spirit
must be recovering.

208
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,208
[JOSEPH] For now,
let's do what we can.

209
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,875
May I humbly suggest that
we petition the witch Viv

210
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,000
for additional assistance
in this matter?

211
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,458
Yes, of course.

212
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,916
Priapus, I'd like you to go
where she's being confined

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,500
and take stock of her condition.

214
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,375
Got it!

215
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,875
[JOSEPH]
Like as not,

216
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,000
they'll be keeping her in a cell
deep within the monastery.

217
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,583
Joseph, what's there to stop us
from rescuing Maria right away?

218
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,208
The Church.

219
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,583
They'll put her on trial,

220
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,083
but that's not the ambition
of a single day's work.

221
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,291
There's not a lot of time,
but we do have some.

222
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,166
For now, let's size
up the task ahead.

223
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,375
[ARTEMIS]
As you wish.

224
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,125
And Good luck, both of you!

225
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,375
Joseph, I...

226
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,875
[JOSEPH]
Huh?

227
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,625
I should've been with her.
I hope you can forgive me that.

228
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,458
[JOSEPH]
You were there with her.

229
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,833
In the moment when she
needed you the most.

230
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,083
You have my gratitude.

231
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,875
Huh? How in the nine
hells did they get her?

232
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,291
[ARTEMIS]
Treachery.

233
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,083
[EZEKIEL] They employed a
foul smoke to weaken her.

234
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,250
Edwina, where are
the guild members?

235
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,708
They said they're off to
Savoia, to visit Nice.

236
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:07,833
[VIV growls]

237
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,583
[GUILLAUME]
Of course you can't save Maria!

238
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,916
You'll be branded a
heretic, you simpleton!

239
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,666
The circumstances of her capture
were totally devoid of honor!

240
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,166
Lady Maria may be a witch,

241
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,166
but her deeds have
saved countless lives!

242
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,833
The truth cannot be
swept aside, Milord!

243
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,791
[GUILLAUME growls]
Joseph!

244
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,958
You babble on and on about
this girl who aided the enemy!

245
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,500
Your father was the very
picture of levelheadedness,

246
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:37,416
but you are a simpering
fool! [panting]

247
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,250
Don't trouble yourself
with the Church's deeds.

248
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,208
They will banish her,
of that I am certain.

249
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,375
Her life will not be forfeit.

250
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,833
[sighs] Beg pardon, but that
artificial arm of Galfa's--

251
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,541
[GUILLAUME] The British
who beat us the other day

252
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,250
are meeting reinforcements,

253
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,000
that they may return
here all the stronger.

254
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,416
This never would
have happened

255
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,958
if we'd killed those whoresons
when we had the chance!

256
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,833
And it's all thanks to
your precious Maria!

257
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:06,875
So instead of being led
around France by your loins,

258
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,500
go home and prepare for battle.

259
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,666
[GALFA]
Following his loins

260
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,583
could've saved us
a lot of trouble.

261
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,208
Spare me your wit.

262
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,291
[GALFA]
Huh?

263
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,375
You were told to take
her maidenhood,

264
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,583
yet the girl's purity
is still intact!

265
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,458
We were... interrupted.

266
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,583
[GUILLAUME] Did pity for
Joseph stay your hand?

267
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,750
Surely you jest.

268
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,083
[GUILLAUME]
You murder without remorse,

269
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,041
but deflowering one
witch is a bridge too far?

270
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,208
You wanted Maria reduced
to where she couldn't

271
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,291
use her magic to
interfere with our battles,

272
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,666
and I delivered in full.

273
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,125
[GUILLAUME]
Yes, but--

274
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,166
Milord, you got what you wanted
with a minimum of fuss,

275
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,708
the Devil take the how.

276
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,000
But, Galfa, who is to say
her magic won't return

277
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,958
once the shock of your
attack wears off?

278
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,250
[BERNARD] I do not understand.
Why are Le Comte's men

279
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,875
not readying a pyre
for her as we speak?

280
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,916
[GILBERT] We cannot
burn a witch in haste.

281
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,250
I will need to create
the proper documentation,

282
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,833
along with the village's priest.

283
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,625
And her interrogation must
be duly transcribed.

284
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,416
Also as inquisitor here, I
must proceed in such a way

285
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,791
so as to not dishonor
my holy office.

286
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:13,916
[BERNARD]
Nonetheless...

287
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The formalities
must be observed.

288
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,458
[BERNARD]
Of course they must.

289
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,541
[VIV] Whip me up something
to eat, would you?

290
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,333
[EDWINA] Will you be
all right, going alone?

291
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,291
[VIV] I can't let her
molder away in a cell

292
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,166
while I wait for word
from the others!

293
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,666
What could possibly
go wrong?

294
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,250
I'll never understand why she
and Maria are so eager to risk

295
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,500
their necks for
other people's sake.

296
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,166
What do you think about it?

297
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,916
[coos]

298
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,458
[BERNARD] Gilbert has taken
to his role of inquisitor

299
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,791
with great zeal.

300
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,250
He'd not have bothered
with the doctor otherwise.

301
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,750
[MARIA grunts]

302
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:51,791
[BERNARD] Irony of ironies,
your purity remains intact.

303
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,541
That said, your infernal powers
seem to have abandoned you.

304
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:59,541
With them, escaping here would
be the work of an instant.

305
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,833
[MARIA] You've got me right
where you want me.

306
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,458
Why are you here?

307
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:07,125
[BERNARD] Something has
been... bothering me.

308
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,250
[ENGLISH CAPTAIN A]
Onward, men! It's time to send

309
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,875
that bastard Guillaume
running like a whipped dog!

310
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,666
[ENGLISH SOLDIERS]
Saint George, protect us!

311
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,208
Saint George, protect us!
Saint George protect us!

312
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:20,666
[ARTEMIS]
Viv!

313
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,541
I haven't the time for this!

314
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,250
Please, show her mercy,
Saint Michael! [screams]

315
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,333
Is it true you mean to rescue
Maria from her bondage?

316
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,166
[VIV] But of course.
Need you even ask?

317
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,291
[MICHAEL] Why do you embrace
such rebellion?

318
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,583
That girl is my friend.

319
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,958
Bladud son of Rud Hud Hudiras.

320
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,708
Awaken from Trinovantum and
lend me your clockwork wings.

321
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,666
[ENGLISH CAVALIER A] Is this
the work of France's witch?!

322
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,958
Uh! Get back here!

323
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,208
[VIV]
Let me be frank.

324
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,291
It's high time that you
got off Maria's back.

325
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,125
Whether you agree or not!

326
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,416
All of my actions,
hitherto and evermore,

327
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,041
are the will of Almighty God.

328
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,000
The wishes of the Most High
are above the reproach of man.

329
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,333
To think that you can
overturn the will of Heaven

330
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,250
is naught but conceit.

331
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,541
[VIV] You're nothing but a
gilded marionette, Michael!

332
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,375
What do you say
we cut the strings?

333
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,208
[BERNARD] The woman Martha,
she would have never thrown

334
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,750
that stone had you not
urged her to do it.

335
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,791
By denouncing you, she has
proved her family's piety.

336
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,541
Things would be dangerous
for them had she not.

337
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,708
Tell me this.

338
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,291
Did you have her throw
it for their sake?

339
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,125
Just like a monk,
thinking things into the dirt.

340
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,041
It looked like the indecision
of it was hurting her.

341
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,875
All I could do was make
a choice on her behalf.

342
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,833
[BERNARD]
And it was her face alone

343
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,083
that inspired this act of pity?

344
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,541
[MARIA]
That's right.

345
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,708
[BERNARD] You took
measure of her suffering,

346
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,708
and bade her pass the
bitter cup unto you.

347
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,000
[MARIA]
What's so odd about that?

348
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,250
I hate to watch suffering,
in war or otherwise!

349
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:57,708
[BERNARD] Do you not fear
censure of the Lord God?

350
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,916
Has it ever occurred to you that
the tribulation you so despise

351
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,958
may be a tool of the heavens?

352
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,583
[MARIA] Soldiers perish in
agony as a part of some plan?

353
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,916
If that's truly what's happening
here, then your God is a maniac!

354
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,833
[BERNARD] Trying to comprehend
the will of the Lord

355
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,583
is arrogance, child.
All we can do is surrender

356
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:18,250
ourselves to His authority,
on Earth as in Heaven.

357
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,125
I'd like to see you
say that to someone

358
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,625
with a sword in their gut!

359
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,791
Death on the field of
battle holds meaning

360
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,500
I cannot begin to guess.

361
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:29,416
But I know that
God's love is universal.

362
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,166
The faithful who die in
service of righteous war

363
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,958
shall have their sins absolved.

364
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,333
[MARIA]
That's absurd!

365
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,916
For being everywhere,
if words are all God gives,

366
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,666
then it's the same as nothing!

367
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,208
[BERNARD gasps]
The same as... nothing?

368
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,583
Our Lord?

369
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,833
[BERNARD] Did you...
just say "the same?"

370
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,458
So nothing and all, are one?

371
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:02,583
But then how can anything
truly exist in the first place?

372
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,250
[MARIA] You don't know what
you're saying.

373
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,291
All you're doing
is parroting beliefs

374
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,333
that you don't even
really understand.

375
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,250
If God ever deigned to appear,

376
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,666
it would clear everything
up at once.

377
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,958
Instead of relying on a
silent God, why not depend

378
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,625
on one another when there's
something that needs fixing?

379
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,208
[BERNARD] How could the world
endure without God's guidance?

380
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,791
We would fall to ruin.
Of course, Saint Thomas

381
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,708
proved the existence
of God by his Five Ways.

382
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,250
No! William of Ockham

383
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,500
said that human reasoning
cannot prove God's existence.

384
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,291
Is irrationality the reason
why we need faith?

385
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,375
But Aristotle said that
affirmation and negation cannot

386
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,250
both be true at once. Ergo.

387
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,125
Ergo.

388
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,541
No, wait!

389
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,333
Is consideration of the
unchanging as a premise wrong

390
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,125
from the onset? After severely
doubting the existence

391
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,250
of God, what remains
is true faith!

392
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,750
But, what happens if
God doesn't remain?

393
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,375
Humans live within
the human world.

394
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,708
Of that much, we can be sure.

395
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,666
But is that the sum
of existence?

396
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,000
"Esse est deus"

397
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,541
Yes. Of that much Meister
Eckhart has assured us.

398
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,208
God grants us existence
and awareness.

399
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,958
Unless awareness and existence

400
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,708
are granted to me
by mine own self!

401
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,791
If such a theorem is true, that
of life in a world without God,

402
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,333
then we save ourselves
by our own free will!

403
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,500
Yes, that's it! As Pelagius
set forth in his doctrines,

404
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,916
one must revere God, yet save
themselves with their free will.

405
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,375
For greater prosperity and
happiness, we seek peace

406
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,458
for our souls, with God existing
through our awareness!

407
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,458
If so, the world shall pass
from God to humans,

408
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,708
with faith and
humans in harmony!

409
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:34,791
[ARTEMIS]
Look out!

410
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,666
[EZEKIEL]
Archangel Michael!

411
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,083
[BERNARD gasping]

412
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,750
[MARIA] What have you
been going on about?

413
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,833
I don't understand a word
of it. There's only one thing

414
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,125
we need to live in this world,
and it's simple as can be.

415
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,125
Tell me, I beg of you.

416
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,625
We just need to stand
on our own two feet.

417
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,791
[whimpers]

418
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,375
[BERNARD] Quite the
iconoclast, aren't you?

419
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,666
Thank you for honoring
me with your thoughts.

420
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,833
I hold them in
high regard.

421
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,375
Ah!

422
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,583
[MARIA gasps]

423
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,958
You inferior being without love,

424
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,291
it's time you stop
interfering in our lives!

425
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,541
[EDWINA]
Was the mole that bad?

426
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,250
[PRIAPUS]
Now, please, shame me!
