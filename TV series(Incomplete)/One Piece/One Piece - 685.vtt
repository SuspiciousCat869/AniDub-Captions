00:12:40.988 --> 00:12:41.890
So?

00:12:41.923 --> 00:12:43.560
Get off! You’re
weighing Moocy down!

00:12:43.594 --> 00:12:44.896
Oh, right.

00:12:44.929 --> 00:12:47.200
Excuse us for not
introducing ourselves sooner.

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:50.373
My name is Jeet and the
big fellow behind me is..

00:12:50.406 --> 00:12:51.709
...Abdullah, Hey!

00:12:51.743 --> 00:12:52.612
[LUFFY]
I didn’t ask!

00:12:52.645 --> 00:12:54.649
[JEET]
Whoa, whoa.

00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:57.053
Lookin’ forward to
working with you!

00:12:58.356 --> 00:13:00.226
[yelps] Hey!

00:13:01.429 --> 00:13:02.497
[LUFFY]
I didn’t agree!

00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:03.967
[JEET]
Hey, Look up!

00:13:08.677 --> 00:13:09.846
[PICA]
There you are!

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:11.215
[JEET]
He looks pissed!

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:14.154
[PICA]
I won’t let you get near Doffy!

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:22.137
[JEET]
His arm’s growing back!

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.372
That moron!

00:13:23.405 --> 00:13:26.011
He’s literally staring danger
straight in the face!

00:13:27.047 --> 00:13:28.817
[ABDULLAH]
Mister Straw Hat?

00:13:30.688 --> 00:13:33.359
[inhales] Third Gear, go!

00:13:38.871 --> 00:13:41.108
Armament Hardening!

00:13:48.557 --> 00:13:50.226
[JEET]
We have no place to run!

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.095
We’re doomed!

00:13:51.128 --> 00:13:53.667
[ABDULLAH]
It was nice knowing you!

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.473
[yells]

00:13:59.712 --> 00:14:05.189
[yells]

00:14:06.058 --> 00:14:07.595
Here comes the next punch!

00:14:07.628 --> 00:14:11.401
He can’t possibly divert it!
Not while he’s in mid-air!

00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:16.011
[BOTH]
He’s gonna die!

00:14:16.045 --> 00:14:18.348
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:14:19.585 --> 00:14:23.660
...Grizzly Magnum!

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:27.668
[ALL]
Incredible!

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.271
His head broke!

00:14:29.304 --> 00:14:31.408
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Lord Pica!

00:14:35.818 --> 00:14:38.355
[BOTH]
Oh, yeah!

00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:41.061
[laughing]

00:14:58.462 --> 00:15:00.199
[MARINE A]
Sir! There’s a group of men,

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:03.405
presumably Competitors from the
Colosseum as well as Straw Hat,

00:15:03.439 --> 00:15:05.243
that are headed for
the Royal Palace.

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:08.617
[FUJITORA] I appreciate the
intel, regrettable though it is.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.023
Naturally, I expected a degree
of trouble from those folks,

00:15:12.056 --> 00:15:13.593
seeing as they’re pirates.

00:15:13.627 --> 00:15:15.530
But seeing as they’re
such a rowdy bunch,

00:15:15.564 --> 00:15:19.471
I didn’t expect them to
team up with one another.

00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:22.778
Pardon the inconvenience,
but might I borrow that?

00:15:22.812 --> 00:15:24.983
Uh.

00:15:25.016 --> 00:15:29.926
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A rings]

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:31.195
Cu-Lick.

00:15:31.228 --> 00:15:32.899
[MARINES]
Vice Admiral Bastille!

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:33.867
You have an urgent call!

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.205
One at a time, you imbeciles!

00:15:36.238 --> 00:15:38.843
[MARINE B] Sorry sir, but we
keep getting calls from soldiers

00:15:38.877 --> 00:15:40.881
who were scattered
by Pica’s attack!

00:15:40.914 --> 00:15:42.417
[MARINE C]
Vice Admiral Bastille!

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.621
Emergency call!

00:15:43.654 --> 00:15:45.791
From who? I’m busy!

00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:48.396
[FUJITORA]
Bastille? Are you there?

00:15:48.429 --> 00:15:50.233
Issho? Yes, hello!

00:15:50.266 --> 00:15:53.573
Sir! Do you need assistance?
Where are you?

00:15:53.607 --> 00:15:56.211
[FUJITORA] Word on the street
is the coliseum contenders

00:15:56.244 --> 00:15:59.484
have formed an alliance and
are currently on the move.

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:00.888
[BASTILLE]
You’ve probably noticed,

00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:03.092
but the whole town
is engulfed in chaos,

00:16:03.125 --> 00:16:05.730
so we have our hands
pretty full at the moment.

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:06.666
[FUJITORA]
And I’m thinking that,

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:07.968
if we play our cards right,

00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:10.139
we can use this
to our advantage.

00:16:10.172 --> 00:16:12.611
[BASTILLE]
Huh? What do you mean?

00:16:14.414 --> 00:16:16.084
We’ve got high-ranking officers

00:16:16.118 --> 00:16:20.493
stationed around the island.
Lots of good men on standby.

00:16:20.527 --> 00:16:21.596
Vice Admiral.

00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:24.502
I do believe it’s time
for us to take action.

00:16:24.535 --> 00:16:26.973
Meet me at the foot
of the Royal Palace

00:16:27.006 --> 00:16:29.477
at your soonest convenience.

Get out here, Kyros!

00:16:34.254 --> 00:16:35.523
We need to bring
you in so we can

00:16:35.557 --> 00:16:38.029
stop people from
dying in this game!

have a long way to go.

Somebody, please help!

00:16:50.252 --> 00:16:52.490
I can’t control my body!

[screaming]

00:16:54.562 --> 00:16:57.401
[KYROS] This must be a living
nightmare for those poor people.

00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:00.172
Must they really relive
the same tragedy?

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:16.639
[KYROS] I vow to reclaim our
home by any means necessary!

00:17:24.756 --> 00:17:25.891

Stay strong!

00:17:25.925 --> 00:17:28.964

[REBECCA]
Doing all right!

00:17:38.115 --> 00:17:43.091
Why’d you stop? Hey!

00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:45.764
How’d a degenerate like me
find himself involved in

00:17:45.797 --> 00:17:49.939
a consensual arm climbing with
none other than the Nico Robin!

00:17:49.973 --> 00:17:53.179
I’ll gratefully hold hands with
her all the way to the top!

00:17:53.212 --> 00:17:54.915
[HACK]
I fear that man is disturbed.

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:57.755
It’s like I’m scaling the
softest ladder in the world!

00:17:57.788 --> 00:17:59.123
And what awaits me at the top

00:17:59.157 --> 00:18:01.896
is Mister Luffy and Mister
Zoro’s gleaming smiles!

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.800
I’m not worthy!

too late to turn around!

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.754
Zoro. Be careful!

00:22:40.787 --> 00:22:44.027
I’m gonna go give Mingo
the beating he deserves.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.599
You go get him, Captain.

00:22:49.504 --> 00:22:52.209
I have a score to settle! Move!

00:22:52.243 --> 00:22:53.913
You’ll have to fight me first.

00:22:53.946 --> 00:22:58.021
He has better things to do than
tangle with a pebble like you.

00:22:58.054 --> 00:23:02.965
Deal with it, Soprano Man.
I’m all that you’ve got.

with Pica once again.
