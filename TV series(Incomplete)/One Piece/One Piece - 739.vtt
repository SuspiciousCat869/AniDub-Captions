WEBVTT

00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:37.448
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.187
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:45.497
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.936
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.309
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.213
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:55.417
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:58.591
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.532
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.632 --> 00:03:04.335
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:08.276
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:12.585
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:18.496
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law

00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:20.868
and launched an attack
on the Warlord, Doflamingo,

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:23.040
who had controlled
the Kingdom of Dressrosa

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.576
and threatened to
kill its people.

00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:26.747
In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:28.383
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:30.655
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives,

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:34.930
until finally, Luffy took down
Doflamingo himself.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.931
Let's hurry!

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.081
[LUFFY]
"The Strongest Creature!

00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:48.524
One of the Four Emperors -
Kaido, King of the Beasts!"

00:04:00.982 --> 00:04:02.852
[LUFFY snoring]

00:04:02.953 --> 00:04:04.154
[snoring]

00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:06.258
[snoring]

00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:11.469
Luffy's been sleeping
like a baby for a while now.

00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:15.377
So much for spending time
with his long-lost brother.

00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:17.447
He'll be disappointed, won't he?

00:04:19.686 --> 00:04:24.395
[crying] Wow, what a great guy.

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:27.836
I'm so touched.
I can't fix myself!

00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:31.811
[ROBIN chuckles]
Should I lend you a hand?

00:04:31.911 --> 00:04:34.114
[KYROS]
He's truly a good brother.

00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:36.319
I'm sorry, did we wake you up?

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.525
Oh. So I guess you
heard Sabo's story.

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:41.428
[KYROS]
I caught the last half.

00:04:42.364 --> 00:04:44.401
If our talking didn't wake ya,

00:04:44.502 --> 00:04:46.405
that snore would've
done the job.

00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:50.715
You think it's time
he got out of bed?

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:54.121
[KYROS] No, let him sleep
as much as he wishes.

00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:55.490
I brought him here so that

00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:57.327
he would have
a chance to recover.

00:04:57.996 --> 00:05:01.202
By the way, I may have some
alcohol in the kitchen cellar.

00:05:01.637 --> 00:05:03.941
Yeah? I'll go see! Ha.

00:05:05.277 --> 00:05:07.648
[KYROS] No matter how much
I could thank Luffyland,

00:05:07.748 --> 00:05:09.318
it would never be enough.

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:11.623
The hope he gave to
the people of Dressrosa

00:05:11.723 --> 00:05:15.164
means more than
any of us can express.

00:05:15.264 --> 00:05:16.967
Thanks to all of you,

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:20.307
our kingdom will
be changed forever.

00:05:20.407 --> 00:05:22.979
The pain that you're
feeling right now

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:24.883
is from the injuries
you sustained

00:05:24.983 --> 00:05:26.920
on behalf of our people.

00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:30.059
We must repay you
any way we can.

00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:35.003
Let's start with drinks.

00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:48.998
[KYROS]
You're staying up late.

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:50.134
Yeah, do you mind?

00:05:50.234 --> 00:05:51.468
[KYROS]
No.

00:05:53.106 --> 00:05:58.851
[sighs] Heh. At some point I'd
really like to spar with you.

00:05:58.951 --> 00:06:03.026
Coming from a swordsman of
your caliber, that's an honor.

00:06:03.126 --> 00:06:05.496
Maybe someday
when our wounds heal.

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.469
[ZORO]
Sure. You can have the rest.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.910
Huh? Well, it was
my bottle, but thanks.

00:06:12.812 --> 00:06:14.114
Guess I'll take a nap.

00:06:14.983 --> 00:06:17.788
Hey, got any meat?

00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:32.618
Rebecca.

00:06:36.526 --> 00:06:38.062
Soldier!

00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:39.431
Rebecca.

00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:44.876
[KYROS] I saw the list of
competitors in the colosseum.

00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:49.051
I asked you not to enter.
Why did you do it?

00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:51.991
[REBECCA]
Because... Because I'll win!

00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:54.630
You'll see! I promise!

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.636
When I do, please come back!

00:06:57.736 --> 00:07:00.206
I just want you to stay with me!

00:07:35.744 --> 00:07:37.515
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
the team we might call

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:40.187
the "Curly Hat Crew"
continues their journey

00:07:40.287 --> 00:07:42.190
to a mysterious new island.

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:56.018
[LAW]
Here's the plan.

00:07:56.118 --> 00:07:58.924
I want you to head
to Zou. And take him.

00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:04.134
[NARRATOR] Before they split up
from Luffy's group in Dressrosa,

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:07.576
Law insisted that the Curly Hats
bring along Caesar Clown,

00:08:07.676 --> 00:08:09.478
the mad scientist
from Punk Hazard

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:11.917
who had eaten the Gas-Gas Fruit.

00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:13.620
But on the way there,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.724
the group was
targeted by Big Mom,

00:08:15.824 --> 00:08:17.460
one of the Four Emperors.

00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:20.868
Her intention was to capture
Caesar for her own purposes.

00:08:21.536 --> 00:08:22.839
I am begging you!

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:24.576
I don't want to be
captured by Big Mom!

00:08:24.676 --> 00:08:26.713
Please, it'll be the end of me!

00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:31.088
Look, I stole research
funds from her, okay?

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.694
Well, lucky for you,
our whole plan is screwed

00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:36.031
if we hand you over,
so shuddup, okay?

00:08:37.968 --> 00:08:40.674
[LUFFY]
You guys move on ahead to Zou!

00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:05.758
[CAESAR] Unbelievable!
To think, after all the effort

00:09:05.858 --> 00:09:08.362
it took to escape
Big Mom's ship!

00:09:08.964 --> 00:09:13.205
[growls] Why would you want
to make any more trouble?

00:09:14.842 --> 00:09:16.513
[SANJI] What makes you
think you get a vote?

00:09:16.613 --> 00:09:18.016
Quit whining!

00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:20.353
You can't just order me around!

00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:24.629
[screams]

00:09:24.729 --> 00:09:27.902
I don't have time for
your little tantrum!

00:09:28.002 --> 00:09:29.973
Don't you dare kick me!

00:09:30.073 --> 00:09:32.778
I'm saying this as
a warning to your crew!

00:09:33.513 --> 00:09:36.251
You shouldn't stick
your nose into their affairs!

00:09:36.352 --> 00:09:39.124
I wanted to wait for
the ship quietly, but no!

00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:41.228
You just had to go
rushing ahead!

00:09:41.328 --> 00:09:43.600
Shut up and do
what I tell you to!

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.336
Can you handle that?

00:09:45.436 --> 00:09:48.610
'Cause I could crush your heart
and not lose any sleep over it!

00:09:54.054 --> 00:09:56.860
[CAESAR]
Fine! But I don't like it!

00:09:57.995 --> 00:10:00.634
Coming to shore was
the best idea.

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:02.505
There's still a chance
we can save them.

00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:04.876
But we need you
to cooperate with us!

00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:09.184
[CAESAR] If I'm so important,
perhaps you should be nicer!

00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:10.319
[SANJI]
What was that?

00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:13.994
Haven't you taunted me enough?

00:10:14.094 --> 00:10:15.831
[CHOPPER]
We need to hurry!

00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:19.037
I'll take as much time
as I see fit! Noisy raccoon.

00:10:19.872 --> 00:10:21.810
I'm a reindeer, pal!

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.980
As if there's any difference!

00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:27.688
Of course there is!
Now shut up and let's go!

00:10:29.826 --> 00:10:31.630
Listen, if they die,

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.900
I'm gonna make sure
you pay for it!

00:10:35.203 --> 00:10:38.844
We need your help.
So move your butt!

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.268
Whoa, it's really hard
to run on this ground!

00:10:51.368 --> 00:10:54.374
I wish we hadn't been separated
from Sanji and the others!

00:10:54.474 --> 00:10:59.151
This is awful! We were too
focused on that mysterious girl!

00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:01.221
[NAMI gasps]

00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:04.160
Ah! Nami! I'll help you!

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:07.702
I'll help myself, thank you!

00:11:07.802 --> 00:11:11.876
[BROOK] Huh?! Chivalry's
as dead as I am!

00:11:15.618 --> 00:11:17.220
Thanks for breaking my fall.

00:11:18.022 --> 00:11:19.726
Look out! They're coming!

00:11:19.826 --> 00:11:20.727
[NAMI]
Huh?

00:11:25.103 --> 00:11:26.673
[SHEEPSHEAD]
Yeehaw!

[GINRUMMY chuckles]

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:51.222
Too bad, huh? We caught ya.

00:11:51.322 --> 00:11:54.461
Now, tell us where
you hid the young lady.

00:11:54.562 --> 00:11:56.198
Huh?

00:11:56.298 --> 00:11:57.635
[SHEEPSHEAD] And how'd you
invaders get onto this island?

00:11:57.735 --> 00:11:58.938
Ha?

00:11:59.038 --> 00:12:01.943
Answer me!
Not just anyone could--

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:04.081
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:05.283
What?

00:12:05.383 --> 00:12:07.353
Oh dear, what is it now?

00:12:11.696 --> 00:12:14.636
[BEASTS PIRATE A]
Here comes a Rain-Ruption!

00:12:14.736 --> 00:12:15.637
Again?

00:12:15.738 --> 00:12:16.940
[ALL gasp]

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.475
[BEASTS PIRATE A]
Take cover!

00:12:21.349 --> 00:12:24.923
What's going on here?
Is it raining?

00:12:25.023 --> 00:12:27.026
No, it's more like a geyser!

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:32.639
[screams] It's coming!
It's coming! It's coming!

00:12:32.739 --> 00:12:34.576
We must flee quickly!

00:12:35.043 --> 00:12:37.247
[BOTH]
No!

00:12:37.347 --> 00:12:39.351
[MOMONOSUKE]
Begone, water!

00:12:41.288 --> 00:12:44.427
I'll protect you,
whatever may happen to me!

00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:02.965
Help me!

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:05.169
I'm drowning!

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:08.577
Man! You Devil Fruit guys
are so delicate!

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.118
[BROOK] I'm sorry, Nami!
I'm useless to you now!

00:13:15.457 --> 00:13:20.534
[SHEEPSHEAD] Hey, get back here!
You damn invaders!

00:13:24.374 --> 00:13:29.685

00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.996
Come on! Don't just lay there!

00:13:35.096 --> 00:13:37.968
Uh... You're a real lifesaver.

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:39.606
[NAMI]
You get up, too, Momo.

00:13:39.706 --> 00:13:41.274
Thank you so much.

00:13:51.028 --> 00:13:52.931
Whenever you're in doubt...

00:14:22.223 --> 00:14:26.331

Kill for now!

Yee-haw!

Be careful!

00:14:34.615 --> 00:14:37.120
[BROOK]
This time, I can protect you!

00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:42.363
Allow me to take care of him!

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.203
Don't get cocky!

00:14:45.303 --> 00:14:48.108
Now, Sheep's Horn! Go!

00:14:50.815 --> 00:14:52.250

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.720
What's with his arms?

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.156
How frightful!

00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.126
Come at me!

00:14:57.226 --> 00:14:59.999

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.646
Oh! Bone-kichi's so brave!

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.656
[BROOK]
What kind of ability is this?

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:13.660
[SHEEPSHEAD chuckles]

Brook! Keep him occupied!

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:19.839
[both] Huh?

00:15:20.273 --> 00:15:24.615
[SANJI]
Diable! Mouton Mallet!

00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:28.155
[SHEEPSHEAD groans]

00:15:37.107 --> 00:15:39.210
Master Sheepshead, no!

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.883
[NAMI]
Hey, Sanji!

00:15:41.984 --> 00:15:44.522
[SANJI]
Ah! Nami, my sweet!

00:15:45.691 --> 00:15:47.394
[GINRUMMY]
Who are you monsters?

00:15:47.494 --> 00:15:50.099
Took the words right outta my--

00:15:51.335 --> 00:15:53.038
Ugh. What a creep!

00:15:54.141 --> 00:15:55.677
[PIRATE A]
Miss Ginrummy!

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.684
[GINRUMMY]
All of you, retreat, now!

00:15:58.784 --> 00:16:00.887
Master Sheepshead
has been defeated!

00:16:00.987 --> 00:16:02.223
[PIRATES gasp]

00:16:02.323 --> 00:16:03.993
But we haven't found
the samurai yet!

00:16:04.093 --> 00:16:05.396
He hasn't shown himself,

00:16:05.496 --> 00:16:07.568
even after we
pushed them this far.

00:16:08.202 --> 00:16:10.273
Go report that there's
no samurai here!

00:16:10.373 --> 00:16:11.241
[PIRATES]
Right!

00:16:15.249 --> 00:16:16.953
[MOMONOSUKE sighs]

00:16:17.053 --> 00:16:18.823
[NAMI]
Hey, guys! Look at that!

00:16:18.923 --> 00:16:19.992
Huh?

00:16:24.602 --> 00:16:26.304
[NAMI]
The water's draining.

00:16:28.342 --> 00:16:30.179
Wonder what that was all about.

00:16:30.479 --> 00:16:33.085
This place is rather odd.

00:16:33.185 --> 00:16:35.123
[NAMI]
I hope that girl's okay, too.

00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:38.764
She moves faster than we do,
so I'm sure she's fine.

00:16:39.197 --> 00:16:40.266
[NAMI]
Good point.

00:16:47.615 --> 00:16:48.917
[SANJI]
Huh?

00:16:49.017 --> 00:16:53.627
[CHOPPER] Hey, everybody!
Get over here, quick!

00:16:54.394 --> 00:16:57.367
That's Chopper'emon!
Let us make haste!

00:16:57.467 --> 00:17:00.272
[SANJI] You're right,
we've got no time to lose!

00:17:07.688 --> 00:17:14.334
[PIRATES chattering]

00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:17.440
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:17:19.177 --> 00:17:20.781
[gasps]

00:17:20.881 --> 00:17:21.983
What the hell?

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:24.588
[PIRATES scream]

00:17:25.957 --> 00:17:28.228
[gasps] They're out cold!

00:17:28.328 --> 00:17:31.636
Captain! There's a giant hole!

00:17:31.736 --> 00:17:33.038
A hole?

00:17:33.138 --> 00:17:34.508
[KID PIRATE A]
Something fell here!

00:17:36.011 --> 00:17:37.047
[KID PIRATE B]
Arm yourselves!

00:17:37.147 --> 00:17:39.417
[KID PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:17:40.521 --> 00:17:42.156
[KID PIRATE A]
There!

00:17:49.104 --> 00:17:50.472
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:58.155 --> 00:18:00.392
That crater. It's massive.

00:18:01.127 --> 00:18:02.531
What could've made this?

00:18:02.631 --> 00:18:05.202
[APOO] Yeah, and who
the heck's responsible?

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:09.344
[KID PIRATE C] Wait, it's kinda
shaped like a person.

00:18:09.444 --> 00:18:13.920
[HAWKINS gasps] That's right.
I did hear a legend once

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.259
about a Sky Island where
a great monster lives.

00:18:18.362 --> 00:18:21.101
I believe it's
somewhere around here.

00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:23.172
[APOO]
Huh? Let me get this straight.

00:18:23.272 --> 00:18:25.409
That thing fell
from a Sky Island?

00:18:26.946 --> 00:18:28.683
Captain Kid!

00:18:28.783 --> 00:18:31.923
The impact was so bad it just
capsized one of our ships!

00:18:32.023 --> 00:18:35.998
Capsized it? Who's behind this?

00:18:36.098 --> 00:18:37.735
I'll set 'em straight!

00:18:38.435 --> 00:18:41.809
[NARRATOR] The strong survive
and the weak perish.

00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:45.282
That is the way our world
has always been.

00:18:48.389 --> 00:18:50.492
[NARRATOR]
A few minutes prior.

00:19:04.287 --> 00:19:06.391
Well, what do we have here?

00:19:06.491 --> 00:19:08.362
I don't know, but we
should leave him alone!

00:19:08.462 --> 00:19:10.366
He must be crazy!

00:19:10.466 --> 00:19:13.873
We're 30,000 feet high,
that's not exactly a short drop.

00:19:20.988 --> 00:19:23.092
[NARRATOR] This was a man
who was desperately

00:19:23.192 --> 00:19:25.362
in search of a place to die.

00:19:26.966 --> 00:19:28.836
Who am I to stop him?

00:19:31.275 --> 00:19:33.445
[NARRATOR]
He'd had an eventful life.

00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:37.220
As a pirate, he had
tasted defeat seven times,

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.391
and on 18 separate occasions,

00:19:39.491 --> 00:19:43.165
he'd been captured by
the Navy or enemy ships.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.940
[NARRATOR] He'd spent
quite some time as a prisoner.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.513
And suffered through torture,
again and again.

00:19:58.863 --> 00:20:01.969
[NARRATOR] His objective
was to take his own life

00:20:02.069 --> 00:20:03.573
by the unusual means of

00:20:03.673 --> 00:20:06.612
plummeting off the
edge of a Sky Island.

00:20:11.589 --> 00:20:14.494
[NARRATOR] And now,
we return to the present.

00:20:16.866 --> 00:20:19.404
[NARRATOR] To reiterate,
this is a man who repeatedly

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:21.976
challenged the Navy
and the Four Emperors,

00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:23.880
was captured 18 times,

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.986
and was sentenced
to death 40 times.

00:20:27.487 --> 00:20:31.729
When he was hanged,
the chain crumbled into pieces.

00:20:31.829 --> 00:20:36.104
When he was sent to be beheaded,
the guillotine blade shattered.

00:20:37.006 --> 00:20:40.981
[NARRATOR] When he was
to be impaled, the spear broke.

00:20:41.081 --> 00:20:45.790
Additionally, he sank
a total of nine prison vessels.

00:20:45.891 --> 00:20:49.798
In other words, no one was
capable of killing him.

00:20:49.899 --> 00:20:53.840
In fact, he was incapable
of killing himself.

00:20:55.309 --> 00:20:57.480
[KID PIRATES scream]

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:02.022
[gasps] Now what's happening?

00:21:17.787 --> 00:21:20.159
[KILLER]
Crap! It really is a monster!

00:21:20.761 --> 00:21:24.300
[MAN]
Aw jeez. My head hurts.

00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:28.108
So I survived again.

00:21:28.208 --> 00:21:30.379
Why is it so hard to die?

00:21:34.722 --> 00:21:37.327
That doddering old Whitebeard.

00:21:37.427 --> 00:21:39.531
He pulled it off easy!

00:21:40.868 --> 00:21:43.371
[gasping]

00:21:53.626 --> 00:21:56.565
[NARRATOR] The man who longed
for a place to die.

00:21:56.665 --> 00:21:59.571
King of the Beasts, Kaido.

00:22:05.482 --> 00:22:08.055
[NARRATOR] Those who know
of him have a certain saying.

00:22:08.155 --> 00:22:11.361
"If it's one-on-one,
always bet on Kaido."

00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:15.069
Whether on land,
at sea, or in the air,

00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:18.042
it's a widely-held belief
that this terrifying pirate

00:22:18.142 --> 00:22:21.649
is more powerful than
any other living creature.

00:22:26.325 --> 00:22:29.731
Well, looks like
I have no choice.

00:22:31.802 --> 00:22:33.038
[gasps]

00:22:38.448 --> 00:22:42.089
[groans]

00:22:42.189 --> 00:22:43.926
[KAIDO]
Dammit all!

00:22:45.463 --> 00:22:47.568
Hurry up, Joker!

00:22:47.668 --> 00:22:51.441
It's time for the
final battle. Get ready!

00:22:54.314 --> 00:22:59.090
[KAIDO] If this dreary world
is destroyed, so be it.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.929
Let's start history's
greatest war!

00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:03.966
Are you with me?

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.124
[NARRATOR] Dressrosa celebrates
their new princess,

00:23:16.224 --> 00:23:19.463
as well as King Riku's return
to the throne after ten years.

00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:22.637
But when Fujitora is confronted
by the Navy's heavyweights,

00:23:22.738 --> 00:23:25.844
Inspector General Sengoku
and Great Advisor Tsuru,

00:23:25.944 --> 00:23:29.350
the die he casts will spell the
fate of Luffy and his friends!

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.120
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.991
"Fujitora Takes Action!

00:23:33.091 --> 00:23:35.597
The Complete Siege
of the Straw Hats!"

00:23:35.697 --> 00:23:38.569
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
