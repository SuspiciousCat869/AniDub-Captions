00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:15,828
[KAYA gasps]

176
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,933
[KAYA]
Why were you so cruel to him?

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,036
I know I was wrong to talk
to Usopp without telling you.

178
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,071
I will admit that much,

179
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:28,074
and I'm very sorry for
not being honest with you,

180
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,076
but this situation
did not warrant

181
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,512
that kind of harsh treatment.

182
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,852
May I sit down?

183
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,020
[KAYA]
Go ahead.

184
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,759
[KLAHADORE] It has
been quite some time

185
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,861
since I first arrived
at this house.

186
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,596
Soon it will be three years

187
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,032
that I have been in the
service of your family.

188
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,800
I will never forget
what happened

189
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,936
when I showed up at
your father's door.

190
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,642
[KAYA gasps]

191
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,314
[KAYA gasps]

192
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,624
[KAYA whimpers]

193
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,397
[KLAHADORE] My former employers
were brutal, pitiless men.

194
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,098
I'd been kicked off
the ship I worked on

195
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,000
for some small
blunder I had made.

196
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,835
And with no work or money,

197
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,104
I was on the verge of
dying like a beggar.

198
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,774
‐‐[KAYA gasps]
‐‐[GUARD A] Hey you, beat it!

199
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:35,741
[GUARD B]
Get outta here!

200
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,677
This isn't the place
for the likes of you!

201
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,913
[KAYA gasps]
Huh?

202
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,821
What? But, sir... He...

203
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,497
[GUARD A] Understood! Take
him inside and tend to him.

204
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,465
[KLAHADORE]
As far as I know,

205
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,767
I would've died without
your father's help.

206
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,136
I owe my life to your parents.

207
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,674
And now that they're gone,
I owe my life to you.

208
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,844
[KLAHADORE]
I know that it isn't my place

209
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,713
to interfere with
your friendships.

210
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,848
I wouldn't have taken
such a bold step

211
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,784
unless I thought it
absolutely necessary.

212
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:19,852
It's just that Usopp

213
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:23,856
isn't exactly known for
his upstanding character.

214
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,726
You see, If anything
were to happen to you,

215
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,995
it would be my fault for
not seeing to your safety

216
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,732
and I would never be able to ask
forgiveness from your parents!

217
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,902
Do you think ill of me for my
childish behavior earlier today?

218
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,171
No, of course I don't.

219
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,174
I'm thankful to have you
around too, Klahadore,

220
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,877
but I stand by my opinion.

221
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,213
Usopp is one of the
nicest people I know.

222
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,881
[KLAHADORE]
We'll see about that.

223
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,816
Until then, he is still
not welcome here.

224
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,986
Klahadore! You blockhead!

225
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,155
[KLAHADORE]
"Blockhead" will do just fine.

226
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,241
[NAMI]
Hey, Where'd Luffy go?

227
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:19,178
Who knows? He probably
ran after that captain.

228
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,913
I bet he's at his secret spot!

229
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,748
Yeah, over by the shore.

230
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:26,585
He always goes there when he's
gonna think something over.

231
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,587
Should we go see?

232
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,890
[ZORO]
Huh? He's fine.

233
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,591
[NAMI] Luffy can
take care of himself,

234
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,959
but where's your other friend?

235
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,861
[PEPPER, CARROT]
Oh yeah, Onion!

236
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,597
Come to think of it, he just
up and disappears a lot.

237
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,234
Yeah! And then he shows up
outta nowhere all freaked out!

238
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,938
[ONION screaming]
Terrible news, guys!

239
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,073
You see?

240
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,709
[ONION]
Listen to me!

241
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,712
Some nut job is on his way here
and he only walks backwards!

242
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,646
[PEPPER, CARROT]
You liar.

243
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,781
It's the truth!

244
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,116
There he is!

245
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,117
[NAMI, PEPPER, CARROT]
Hm?

246
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,562
Now, which one of you people
has the nerve to call me weird?

247
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,967
I'm just a normal guy.

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,969
S'that so? You look insane.

249
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,070
[JANGO]
Don't be silly.

250
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,973
I'm just an ordinary,
run of the mill hypnotist.

251
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,743
[ONION]
A hypnotist? Really? Awesome!

252
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,077
[PEPPER]
Show us something!

253
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,813
[CARROT]
Yeah! Do something!

254
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,749
What?!

255
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,785
You fools, what makes you think
that I would want to reveal

256
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,320
my masterful
hypnosis techniques

257
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,655
to a bunch of
roadside strangers?

258
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,157
[JANGO]
Okay, you convinced me.

259
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,692
Now, watch the ring closely.

260
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,860
[ZORO]
What a ham!

261
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,929
So, by the count of "Jango,"
you'll be in a deep sleep.

262
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,598
Alright, are you ready?

263
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:46,332
[KIDS gasping]

264
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,166
[JANGO]
One...

265
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,134
Two...

266
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,335
Jango!

267
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,005
[KIDS, JANGO snoring]

268
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,608
[ZORO]
Who is this freaky weirdo?!

269
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,352
[LUFFY]
Hi!

270
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,686
[USOPP gasps]

271
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,821
What're you doin' here?

272
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,156
[USOPP]
I came here to be alone,

273
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,191
but I guess that's
not happening!

274
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,193
Did you follow me?
What d'you want?

275
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,362
[LUFFY]
Oh, ya know, nothin.

276
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:21,333
[LUFFY grunting]

277
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,171
[LUFFY]
Oh...Ouch... [laughs]

278
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,211
[USOPP]
I can't believe that butler!

279
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,647
Insulting my old man like that!

280
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,982
[LUFFY]
Yeah, I hate that guy too!

281
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:40,319
No matter what anyone says,
Yassop was a great pirate.

282
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,520
Yeah! Really!

283
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,256
I've always looked up to my
old man for living everyday

284
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,892
with his life on the line,
out in the open ocean.

285
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,695
He made a brave choice
and I admire him for that!

286
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,697
And then that stupid,
snotty butler

287
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,065
stomped all over my pride.

288
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,733
He's gonna pay for this!

289
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:55,901
Hey, wait.

290
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,237
Do you know if you're ever
gonna see that girl again?

291
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,241
[USOPP gasps]
I don't know. Eh...

292
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,410
I'll consider it if that
butler apologizes to me

293
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,011
for the things he said.

294
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,413
That butler right there?

295
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,749
Yeah... That's the one, if he‐‐

296
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,052
What in the world is
he doing down here?!

297
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,354
[LUFFY]
What's the big idea?

298
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,589
Hey, Jango.

299
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,092
I specifically ordered you to
keep yourself inconspicuous.

300
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,361
That doesn't mean
sleeping in the road.

301
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:26,098
Relax man, I've perfected
the skills of the chameleon.

302
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,299
I blend in.

303
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,035
[LUFFY] There's someone else
with him and, man, is he weird!

304
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,403
I've never seen him before.

305
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,938
Who is he?

306
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:37,209
So, have all the necessary
preparations been made?

307
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,944
But of course.

308
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,450
[JANGO]
We can start anytime...

309
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,253
...on the "Rich
Girl Murder Plan!"

310
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,089
[LUFFY, USOPP gasp]

311
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,559
[USOPP]
Ah! Murder?

312
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,352
[KLAHADORE]
Don't call it murder, Jango.

313
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,254
I don't like the sound of it.

314
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,856
[JANGO]
Oh right, accident.

315
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,625
It's an accident...
that you planned.

316
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,995
Uh, what are those
guys talking about?

317
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,764
Just be quiet.

318
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,533
Maybe if we listen a little
closer, we can find out.

319
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,368
[KLAHADORE]
We can't simply kill her.

320
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,836
It is critical to our plan

321
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,373
that Miss Kaya perishes in
an unfortunate accident.

322
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,709
So don't screw that up!

323
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,845
So basically, on your signal,
the men and I storm the village

324
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,549
and manage to "accidentally"
kill the little rich girl.

325
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,552
Then you get her inheritance
and we all get paid, right?

326
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,520
You moron!

327
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,522
Your ignorance is astounding!

328
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,892
We're not related, so how could
I inherit anything from her?

329
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,961
[JANGO]
You'll work very hard to!

330
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,296
[KLAHADORE]
No Jango, I won't.

331
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,366
Now listen to me, this is
the most important part.

332
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,534
Before you kill her,

333
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,737
you'll use your hypnosis to
make Kaya write her will.

334
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,905
And it will say,

335
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,342
"I leave my entire fortune
to my butler, Klahadore".

336
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,376
[USOPP gasps]

337
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,712
Then, and only then,

338
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:23,582
will I have undisputed control
of her enormous fortune.

339
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:26,819
And no one will suspect a thing.

340
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:27,753
[USOPP whimpers]

341
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,588
[KLAHADORE]
I have spent three long years

342
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,590
gaining the trust of
everyone around me

343
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,392
so that it would be
unsurprising for her

344
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:37,363
to leave the entirety of
her inheritance to me.

345
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,666
[JANGO] Three years as
a butler for this, huh?

346
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:45,337
You sure had us scared
back then, Captain Kuro.

347
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,505
Three years ago,

348
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,875
you suddenly said you were
giving up life as a pirate.

349
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,845
In no time at all you set up
someone to be your double.

350
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:57,416
Then you let the world see
Captain Kuro get executed.

351
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,861
Only now, do I understand

352
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,063
that was just the
beginning of this plan.

353
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,465
You are the "Man of
a Thousand Plans."

354
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:17,970
Never call me that again.
I abandoned that name years ago.

355
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,805
I now wish to obtain my wealth

356
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,474
without attracting the
attention of the government.

357
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,610
In other words,
I'm a pacifist.

358
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:28,647
[laughing] Some
pacifist you are!

359
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,983
Murdering an entire family

360
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,086
doesn't exactly
qualify as peaceful.

361
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,656
Hold on, I haven't
murdered an entire family.

362
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,491
The father's death
wasn't planned.

363
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,994
[JANGO] Whatever you say,
it makes no difference to me.

364
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,164
If it's all the same to you,
hurry up and give the word.

365
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,832
The crew is getting bored.

366
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,669
We've been waiting in the waters
near here for over a week,

367
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,006
and the men are growing
more anxious by the minute.

368
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:03,482
[USOPP] This is horrible!
This is really horrible!

369
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,951
[USOPP grunting]

370
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,586
What are they talking about?

371
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,854
Is it bad guy stuff?

372
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,423
What? Weren't you
listening to any of that?

373
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,026
Those guys aren't
just bad, they're evil!

374
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,495
Captain Kuro is known
to be the most devious,

375
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,863
scheming pirate around!

376
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,531
And though he's
known for his smarts,

377
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,967
he's legendary for
his brutality.

378
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,635
Word had it that
the Marines caught

379
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,871
and executed him
three years ago,

380
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,440
but Captain Kuro
is alive and well,

381
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,542
posing as Klahadore the butler!

382
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,545
And he's had his diabolical
sights set on Kaya's fortune

383
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,815
for the last three years!

384
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,884
[LUFFY]
Hmm...

385
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,519
[VILLAGERS screaming]

386
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,788
[USOPP] First, they'll
attack the village,

387
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,223
then they'll kill Kaya!

388
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,891
[KAYA whimpers]

389
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,228
[KAYA screams]

390
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,898
[USOPP] This is bad!
This is seriously bad!

391
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,971
[USOPP crying]

392
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,507
Hey, get down! They'll see you!

393
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,544
Hey, bad guys! You better
stay away from that girl!

394
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,079
[USOPP groans]

395
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,714
[JANGO]
Who are you?!

396
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,182
You idiot, they've spotted you!

397
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,583
Come on! Hurry up and hide

398
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,886
before they decide you
need a long slow death!

399
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,090
Well now, If it isn't Usopp,
the mischievous town liar.

400
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,527
[screams] Oh, no!
I'm spotted too!

401
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,895
[KURO]
Did you...

402
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,830
...hear anything?

403
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,166
Uh, Nope. Nothing at all.
I don't know what you mean.

404
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,834
We didn't hear a peep.
We just got here,

405
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,602
so we didn't hear
anything about anything!

406
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,570
We heard it all!

407
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,772
Shut up!

408
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,741
[KURO chuckles]

409
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,612
[JANGO]
Well, If you say so.

[JANGO]
Pay attention, boys!

411
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,919
And watch this ring closely.

412
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,620
[LUFFY]
Hm? Okay.

413
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,623
Don't you get it? It's some
kind of weapon, we gotta run!

414
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,294

you will be in a deep sleep.

[USOPP whimpers]

He had to go and fall
off a cliff, didn't he?

426
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,656
A pity really, I didn't
mean to kill him,

427
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,226
but there's no way
he could've survived.

428
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,828
[USOPP]
This can't be happening!

429
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,163
They killed him!

430
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,999
He's really... dead!

431
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,567

What about the other one?

432
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,236
Shall I take care of him?

433
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,837
There's no need.

434
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:42,007
Everything he could say
would sound like, lies.

[USOPP gasps]

436
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,811
[KURO] Jango,
tomorrow at daybreak,

437
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,646
the men are to
attack the village.

438
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,747
Rough up the villagers some

439
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,116
and tear up their homes
a little, for good measure.

440
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:56,955
And above all, make sure Miss
Kaya's death looks accidental.

441
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,156
Tomorrow...

442
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,661
Just accept it Usopp. There
is nothing you can say or do

443
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,364
to warn the villagers of
this impending tragedy.

444

[USOPP gasps, screams]

445
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,037
[JANGO]
Are you sure about that one?

446
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,340
[KURO] Of course I am,
my plans are flawless.

447
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,815
[USOPP]
I can't believe this!

This is terrible!
I gotta do something!

449
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,955
Everyone in the village I
grew up with is in danger,

450
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,157
and Kaya's gonna be killed!

451
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:38,130
[USOPP] I can't let that
happen to the people I love!

Who are you?

been a little down lately,

455
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,980
so I thought I'd tell you
a story to cheer you up!

to mind your own business!

Please leave or I'll call
someone who will make you leave!

[KAYA laughs] And then?
What happened after that?

I fought of course!

00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,160
