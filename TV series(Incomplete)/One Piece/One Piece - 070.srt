As you can see,
my catch is bigger!

Moron! This competition
is about weight.

How much meat we bring in,
not the length of the beast!

361
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,123
And mine is obviously
way beefier than yours!

Ha! Who cares how
husky your dinosaur is‐‐

363

all that matters is the
amount that can be cooked!

And that thing's all bones.

pounds of meat there!

All right.

The next eruption from
that volcano will signal

378
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,791
the end of the competition.

379
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,626
You have till then
to secure your prey

380
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,261

Please forgive me,

392
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,633
but there is something
I must attend to.

What? You're leaving?

394
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,204
No choice.

395
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,506
That's the signal my
opponent and I use to mark

396
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,541
the beginning of our fight.

397
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,776

With who? Where?

it became our routine.

That volcano is our marker.

405
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,327
Whenever it erupts, we begin.

this is about, okay?

to me and Miss Valentine.
