1
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,691
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:41,228
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:45,065
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:50,036
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,606
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,707
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,144
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,546
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,783
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:06,220
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:09,422
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,293
Is that-- No-- It can't be.

13
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:19,400
Those aren't the real
blueprints for Pluton.

14
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,769
Oh, they're real.
Don't believe me?

15
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,777
Hey, Spanda.

16
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,513
The reason why Tom and
Iceberg risked their lives

17
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,315
to protect this is simple.

18
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,683
Just give me the blueprints!

19
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,418
If an ancient weapon
fell into the hands

20
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,054
of some power-hungry
dumbass like you,

21
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,822
who knows what might happen.

22
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:45,225
In other words, the shipwrights
passed this blueprint down

23
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,094
to create a possible
countermeasure

24
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,330
against another weapon.

25
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,333
Now I agree that Robin's
a dangerous woman.

26
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,535
As long as people
like you are around,

27
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,737
even if she has
the best intentions,

28
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,339
her knowledge could still

29
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,075
be used to wreak havoc
on the whole world.

30
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,210
But now she's got
friends who are willing

31
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,780
to risk their lives to make
sure that never happens.

32
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:11,384
And I think they're up to
the job. So I'm making a bet.

33
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:32,772
What the hell are you doing? No!

34
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,378
If you end up making
a weapon after all,

35
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:40,214
we won't be able to fight back
anymore, and that's possible

36
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,082
if you're able
to take Nico Robin

37
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,051
through the Gates of Justice.

38
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:47,421
Everything's resting on the
Straw Hats, and if they're able

39
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,756
to get her outta here,

40
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,525
then you'll be left
with nothing at all.

41
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:55,128
I've placed my bet.
I think they can do it.

42
00:04:55,796 --> 00:05:02,102
Cutty Flam, how dare
you burn my blueprints!

43
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,538
I'm gonna make you pay!

44
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,217
Bro!

45
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,453
Big Bro's falling
down the waterfall!

46
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,057
Franky!

47
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,292
Hey! Straw Hats!

48
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:27,828
Jump into the waterfall!

49
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,463
Give it all
you've got! Trust me!

50
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:36,036
Is that Rocketman?

51
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,277
It's flying!

52
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:53,253
Brings back memories,
don't it, Tom?

53
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:59,226
Giving a hand to that Roger guy
is something I'll never forget.

54
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,063
In fact, it's something
I take great pride in!

55
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,699
My name's Luffy and I'm
gonna be King of the Pirates.

56
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,400
Really?

57
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,134
Yep.

58
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,504
That boy may have a screw loose,

59
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,807
but come to think
of it, so did Roger.

60
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,811
It's funny, all those years ago
you helped him out,

61
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,314
and now Tom's Workers
is coming together again

62
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:23,149
to help out this Straw Hat Boy.

63
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,186
We sure didn't learn
our lesson, did we?

64
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,559
But I gotta feeling you woulda
done the same thing, Tom.

65
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,670
We're gonna crash!

66
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:46,106
Hey! What the hell are we doing?

67
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:57,684
"Obtain the Five Keys!
The Straw Hat Pirates vs. CP9!"

68
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:44,698
No way. They're here.

69
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,034
Yoyoi!

70
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,576
No! Damn it!
You're comin' with me!

71
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:02,349
If only I could figure out a
way to get these handcuffs off.

72
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:06,487
Alright, I'm lettin'
you guys off the chain!

73
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,388
Now go give 'em hell!

74
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,557
I want you to spackle the walls

75
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,493
of the Tower of Law
with their guts!

76
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,328
You hear me?

77
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,797
You've got full authority
to butcher them!

78
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,666
Lucci! You come with us!

79
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,402
Protecting me is your
one and only priority!

80
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:25,305
Got it? Where's Funkfreed?

81
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:39,085
There! Good boy!

82
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,525
An elephant that
ate a devil fruit

83
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,160
with the powers of a sword?

84
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,828
Nope. The opposite in fact.

85
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,364
My sword ate the
elephant-elephant fruit.

86
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,232
It's a long story.

87
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,668
I've got CP9 on my side,

88
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,071
and I've got my
trusty elephant sword.

89
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,772
As long as I maintain my cool,

90
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,674
there's nothing
that can stop me.

91
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,210
Now! We're off to
the Gates of Justice.

92
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,645
If you really think
you can take this woman

93
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,314
from me, go ahead
and try it, Straw Hat!

94
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,149
Big Bro Franky is alive!

95
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,518
The Straw Hats
actually made it across!

96
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,721
They finally did it!

97
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,589
Big Bro is free at last!

98
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,157
And he's gonna join the fight!

99
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,526
Hell yeah! Our bro
is one helluva guy!

100
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,295
Go get em, Franky!

101
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,232
Take 'em down! Go Straw Hats!

102
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,168
The rest is in
your hands, Straw Hat.

103
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,140
Hey, talk to me! You guys okay?

104
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,175
C'mon you old hag! Start moving!

105
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,278
And just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

106
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:40,414
Pullin' a flat out stupid
stunt with Rocketman like that?

107
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,583
I mean, thanks
for savin' us and all.

108
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,085
Hey! You hear me? Get up!

109
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:49,656
Please! Don't die!
Don't die, you old hag!

110
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,671
Bloody noses!

111
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:07,675
You're damn lucky a
bloody nose is all you've got!

112
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,510
Alright! We made it!

113
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,213
Guess he's fine.

114
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,749
Thanks for the ride across,
monster granny!

115
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,751
C'mon you guys, get up already!

116
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,687
You've been through
worse than that!

117
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,557
Oh, sure, that's
easy for you to say.

118
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,392
You're made out of rubber.

119
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,361
We're lucky we're not
in pieces right now,

120
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,195
after a crash like that.

121
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,437
See? You're all just fine.

122
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,772
You know, you guys
are a bunch of weirdos.

123
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,641
It felt like I should
point that out.

124
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,343
There's a staircase over there!

125
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,578
We better move it if
we're gonna find Robin!

126
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,453
Not so fast!

127
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,457
What the hell is that?

128
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,461
Chapapapa! So you've
invaded the Tower of Law!

129
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,496
There's no point in going on.

130
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,465
You won't ever find Nico Robin!

131
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,734
Lucci's already taken her
to the Gates of Justice.

132
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,304
Oh, and the Chief's
with them, too.

133
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,810
Really? Thanks for telling us
where we should start looking.

134
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,713
Chapapa. Why'd I tell them that?

135
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,415
He's not too bright.

136
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,150
It doesn't matter.

137
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,152
I might have told you
where they're headed

138
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,221
but I'm not gonna tell
you how to get there!

139
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,790
And you'll never make
it past our CP9 agents!

140
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:33,193
We've been given direct orders
to eliminate you, chapapa!

141
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,696
Did he say eliminate us?

142
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:36,864
You want Nico Robin?

143
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,400
Then you're gonna have to
fight your way through each

144
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,802
and every one of our agents
if you want to succeed.

145
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,437
Duh. I liked it
better when you were

146
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,439
telling us things we
didn't already know.

147
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:48,576
Chapapa. You've got
some fire in you.

148
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:51,178
But, I've got one more
thing to tell you.

149
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,247
Well say it! We're listening.

150
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,583
Ah. Well, thank you.

151
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:58,251
Now. Gimme just a sec.

152
00:11:58,618 --> 00:11:59,753
Take a look at this!

153
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,322
A key?

154
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:02,823
What's it for?

155
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,426
For all you know,
it might be the key needed

156
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,729
to unlock Nico Robin's
Sea Prism Stone handcuffs!

157
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:09,997
Sea Prism Stone?

158
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,534
It's a stone that nullifies a
person's devil fruit abilities.

159
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,704
It's basically the same as
when they fall into the ocean.

160
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,773
Well now we finally know why
Robin hasn't been fighting back.

161
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,675
I knew it wasn't adding up.

162
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,612
Yeah, she's not the
type to give up so easy.

163
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:26,046
I'm sure she'd be
mopping the floor

164
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,415
with their ugly mugs
if she had the choice.

165
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,317
She must feel so helpless.

166
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,752
Well, that sucks.

167
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,654
Even if you were
able to get past us

168
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:36,257
and save her in
some imaginary world,

169
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,093
that sea prism stone is
tougher than a diamond.

170
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,527
She'd have to live
with them on her wrists

171
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,096
for the rest of her life.

172
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:46,300
Chapapa. Why do I keep
telling them this stuff?

173
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,402
He really is dumb, isn't he?

174
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,770
So be my guest.

175
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,273
Go try to save her,
if you think you can!

176
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:54,741
Chapapapapa!

177
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,445
Fine! Gimme that key!

178
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:07,320
Guess all the CP9 guys
can use that move.

179
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:08,789
Don't be hasty.

180
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:12,326
You don't even know if this is
the actual key I've got here.

181
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,595
You have got ta be
freaking kidding me!

182
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:20,301
It might be a key to
another pair of cuffs.

183
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:24,137
For all you know! Chapapa-papa!

184
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:29,577
In this great Tower of Law.

185
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,780
There are five members
of CP9, including me!

186
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,749
And each and every member
has their very own key!

187
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:40,421
So let's begin a
game of hide and seek!

188
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:42,556
So you're saying we gotta
beat each one of you guys,

189
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,459
and then try every key
on her handcuffs?

190
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,062
And that's the only way we're
gonna find the real one?

191
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:50,064
What a stupid way
to keep us busy.

192
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:51,832
While we're wasting time
on your key-hunting game,

193
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:55,369
your chief is gonna escape
through those gates with Robin.

194
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,137
That's exactly the plan!

195
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,207
Why can't I keep my mouth shut?

196
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,710
Retrieving Robin is
our first priority.

197
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:05,279
If we focus on getting
Robin back first,

198
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,314
we can worry about
the keys afterward.

199
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,117
Let's just ignore that
weirdo and start searching.

200
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,553
Chapa! Chapapapa.

201
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,355
Hey, you've got some brains!

202
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:16,824
But I'm afraid if you do that,

203
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,260
then you'll leave me
with no choice.

204
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:23,096
I'll toss the key into
the ocean! Chapapa!

205
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:28,502
We're kind enough to give you
guys a sporting chance. See ya.

206
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,437
Hey! Get back here!

207
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,405
Hold on, Luffy!

208
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,574
Will you just wait a second?

209
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,445
Stop running and listen to me!

210
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,615
Let's decide what we're
gonna do before we split up!

211
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,784
Shut up! Just let me go!

212
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,353
Get ahold of
yourself, Straw Hat!

213
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:50,090
I'm guessing Lucci's
that pigeon guy?

214
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,659
Yeah, that's him.

215
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:53,160
From what that freak told us,

216
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,296
he's the only one they've
got guarding Robin.

217
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:58,299
Our best bet's to
send Luffy after them.

218
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,134
Luffy, since you're
raring to go,

219
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,503
you can hunt down
that pigeon guy.

220
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:04,238
Let me go! Let me go!

221
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,807
Excluding Luffy, we've
got a headcount of six.

222
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,411
And he said there are only
five CP9 agents with keys.

223
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:12,346
So I say we spread out,
take them down,

224
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,081
then catch up with Luffy.

225
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:18,252
If they drag her across those
gates, we'll never get her back!

226
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,521
It's a race against time!

227
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:22,255
Then let's get going!

228
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,528
Take 'em down, or we die trying!

229
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:28,596
Yeah!

230
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:31,565
Good luck!

231
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,417
Let me go! Let me go!

232
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,254
Excluding Luffy, we've
got a headcount of six.

233
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:56,724
And he said there are only
five CP9 agents with keys.

234
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:58,659
So I say we spread out,
take them down,

235
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,794
then catch up with Luffy.

236
00:16:01,362 --> 00:16:04,598
If they drag her across those
gates, we'll never get her back!

237
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,666
It's a race against time!

238
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,169
Then let's get going!

239
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,041
Take 'em down, or we die trying!

240
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:14,708
Yeah!

241
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,643
Good luck!

242
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:22,182
Go, pirate guys, go!
You can do it!

243
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,424
Chimney? Gonbe? Where did
those two disappear to?

244
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,461
They must've taken
Robin this way!

245
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,697
They couldn't have
gotten too far ahead!

246
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,433
I'm not gonna let them take you

247
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,235
through the Gates
of Justice, Robin!

248
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,707
A secret passage way!
A secret passage way!

249
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,609
It's a secret passage way!

250
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:51,211
We found a secret passage way!

251
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,813
Cobwebs!

252
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,715
Candle-lit!

253
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,817
Slimy walls!

254
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,287
Dark and creepy!

255
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,766
Full of bats?

256
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,572
I'm starting to wonder how
far this thing really goes.

257
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,412
I hear something.

258
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,517
Nothing can stop me now!

259
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:34,254
Let's check it out!

260
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:44,164
There's no help
for you, Nico Robin!

261
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,534
You can keep wishing
for them to come,

262
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,737
but they'll never find their
way to the Gates of Justice!

263
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:11,292
Quit hiding from me,
you pigeon loving jerk!

264
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:13,727
Where are you?

265
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,598
It's gotta be this way!

266
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,502
Which way did they go?

267
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:25,772
It's gotta be that way!

268
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,076
Which way is it?

269
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,047
I bet it's this way!

270
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:37,418
Or maybe it's this way!

271
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:41,221
It's definitely
gotta be this way!

272
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:48,662
This way! Robin!

273
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:54,534
Your pirate friends can't
possibly follow us this far.

274
00:18:58,639 --> 00:18:59,673
What a weird room.

275
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,544
This goes like this,
and that goes like that.

276
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,414
What d'ya think they're doing?

277
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:25,699
C'mon! Open already!

278
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,041
How cool!

279
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:43,384
I've gotta find the kitchen
before I do any more fighting.

280
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,786
I'm in serious
trouble if I don't.

281
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:48,656
Coup de Boo!

282
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,691
I need a bottle
and a half of cola

283
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:53,060
to properly fuel Coup de Boo,
and I've already managed

284
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:55,329
to go through a little
more than two of 'em today.

285
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,197
I gotta nab at least
three full bottles

286
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,366
if I'm gonna take on CP9.

287
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:01,735
There!

288
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,670
That's gotta be the kitchen!

289
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:13,080
Chapapapapapapapapapapapa!

290
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:14,415
You've come face to face

291
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:18,185
with the gossip
loving Silent Fukurou!

292
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,119
I suppose you want my key?

293
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,522
Great, just before
I could refill my cola.

294
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,456
Chapa.

295
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,196
What is this place?

296
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,398
It looks like some
kind of dungeon.

297
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:39,540
Yoyoi! You damn
despicable pirate!

298
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,409
Your hopeless quest for
your friend's freedom

299
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:47,280
has doomed you to die a
dreadful death by my hand!

300
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,583
Do you hear my words?

301
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:56,356
You're doomed! I said
you're doomed, doomed, doomed!

302
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:59,593
Yoyoi!

303
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,365
Geez, he's loud.

304
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,275
No one in there.

305
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:27,487
Nope. Not in there. And empty.

306
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:31,425
What's the deal? I can't
find anyone around here.

307
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,793
Not that I really mind.

308
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,735
So you're too afraid
to face the mighty--

309
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:46,206
--It's not empty.

310
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:55,615
He's asleep? Is he with CP9?

311
00:21:56,716 --> 00:22:00,654
What? He just left the key out
while he's taking a nap?

312
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:04,258
My luck couldn't possibly
be this good, could it?

313
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,126
This is a golden opportunity!

314
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,028
This room better not be empty!

315
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:14,668
Dammit. I'm getting'
real tired of this.

316
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:25,712
What's wrong? Just relax.

317
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:31,318
Tell ya what.
I'll put on some tea.

318
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,667
Well that sounds wonderful!

319
00:22:57,611 --> 00:23:00,413
Your swords are drawn.
You don't waste time.

320
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:05,318
They've been thirsty.
For the taste of blood.

321
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,497
Where the hell did
you fall from, Zoro?

322
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,565
I'm more interested to
know why you're with a wolf.

323
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:20,534
It's weirder that
you're with a giraffe.

324
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,803
I guess this means they
both have devil fruit powers.

325
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:25,172
Not what I expected from CP9.

326
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:28,275
Yeah, no kidding! Is this
place some kind of zoo?

327
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:30,144
On the next One Piece:

328
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:33,581
"Devil Fruit Powers!
Kaku and Jabra Transform!"

329
00:23:33,614 --> 00:23:36,149
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
