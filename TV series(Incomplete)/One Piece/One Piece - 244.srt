without saying a word.

178
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,809
Even if your mouth
won't cooperate,

179
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,377
your pulse will
tell us the truth.

180
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,607
Hahaha!

181
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,444
The wind is out to get you!
Better be careful!

182
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,150
Hey, Granny!
Aren't we going back?

183
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,518
The storm's coming!

184
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:07,454
Oh yeah? Seems
like a perfect time

185
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:11,091
for a stroll around
town if you ask me.

186
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,128
Gives me a little
time to sober up.

187
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:19,066
Oh? Then why're you
still drinking, Granny?

188
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,701
You can't sober up
and booze it up

189
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,670
at the same time, can you?

190
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:24,805
[KOKORO] Hahaha.
Sure I can!

191
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:28,175
I haven't been drinking
all my life fer nothing!

192
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:32,412
Huh? All your life?
That's not true!

193
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,217
[CHIMNEY]
That's not true.

194
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:43,624
That's not true. That's
not true. That's not true!

195
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:47,561
It hasn't been all my life.

196
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:50,330
It's only been eight years.

197
00:13:54,768 --> 00:14:00,341
[steady heartbeat]

198
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:01,642
[LUCCI] Now that
we're all comfortable,

199
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,277
let me explain
the thought process

200
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,579
leading to our hypothesis.

201
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,282
First of all, the way
that you allowed us

202
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:11,085
to retrieve the fake blueprints
is highly suspicious.

203
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,453
After you decided
that the culprits

204
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,054
were related to the government,

205
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,790
you intentionally revealed
the location of the fakes,

206
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,526
presumably in the
hopes of fooling us.

207
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,062
However, what if your
assumption was wrong

208
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,831
and the culprit's
intention was to kill you

209
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,400
rather than to
retrieve the blueprints?

210
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,435
In that case, the
fakes would be useless,

211
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,170
the real blueprints
would be lost

212
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,106
and the will of the
original shipwrights

213
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,108
would not be passed on.

214
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:36,543
Surely you considered
that possibility.

215
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,579
I know you're no fool.

216
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,547
And yet, despite
creating a decoy,

217
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,349
you've seemingly
made no attempt

218
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,619
to pass off the actual
blueprints tonight.

219
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,555
That must mean you've already
entrusted them to someone.

220
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,424
[steady heartbeat]

221
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,226
We still don't know
where they are,

222
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,794
but we can assume
that you don't have them

223
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,129
with you anymore.

224
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,464
That's our hypothesis.

225
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,269
Ah-ah! No squirming.

226
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,238
[LUCCI]
This is still just a theory.

227
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,173
I admit.

228
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,042
We haven't found any
decisive evidence.

229
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,610
And despite the
fact that we've kept

230
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,746
you under surveillance
for the past five years.

231
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,282
We've never seen you
do anything suspicious.

232
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,551
Assuming you did entrust
the blueprints to someone,

233
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,687
they would have to be an
accomplished shipwright

234
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,221
to make any
sense out of them.

235
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,558
[steady heartbeat]

236
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:30,497
Now if we add that to our theory
things start to get interesting.

237
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,533
For example,
let's take a closer look

238
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:35,636
at the fake blueprints
that you left us.

239
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:36,870
Here at the bottom,

240
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:40,507
you can see the signatures of
three different shipwrights.

241
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,577
"Tom," "Iceberg,"
and "Cutty Flam."

242
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,181
And the company
name "Tom's Workers."

243
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,650
You probably thought that this
detail wouldn't mean anything

244
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,318
to whoever took the bait

245
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:54,521
but you had no idea your
enemies were so close.

246
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,625
That was a grave
miscalculation on your part.

247
00:15:57,658 --> 00:16:00,294
If the person who broke
in had been an outsider,

248
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,096
once they found out
that the blueprints

249
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,064
had nothing to do with Pluton,

250
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,367
they would probably
have throw them away.

251
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,234
However.

252
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:09,136
Since we've been
shipwrights ourselves

253
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,203
for the past five years,

254
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:13,306
the names of the designers
are very interesting.

255
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,311
There's a visitor,
sir to see you.

256
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,346
[steady heartbeat]

257
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,414
[LUCCI] Although
many people know

258
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,616
of the legendary
shipwright, Tom,

259
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,754
the details of his actual
company are shrouded in mystery.

260
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:29,223
It's believed to have
existed on this island,

261
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:32,493
but there's no roster
or register to be found.

262
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:34,395
It was no easy task finding out

263
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:37,297
that you were one
of Tom's apprentices.

264
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,634
What few reports
we have indicate

265
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,404
that he taught only
two shipwrights.

266
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,205
And a government
official verified

267
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:49,510
that one of them died in
an accident 8 years ago.

268
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:51,211
[KOKORO]
Real shame.

269
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,781
I know Cutty Flam was
a bit of a loose cannon,

270
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:58,686
but I sure hate to see him go.

271
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:01,155
[LUCCI] It struck a chord.
I thought to myself

272
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,390
"now where have
I heard that name before?"

273
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,492
[steady heartbeat]

274
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,295
He said he's a friend
from years back.

275
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:12,766
Do you know anyone
named "Cutty Flam"?

276
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,833
[ICEBERG]
It was about four years ago,

277
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:17,538
shortly after we started
our undercover operation.

278
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,273
He was a man who
has passed through

279
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,409
Galley-La's gates
many times since.

280
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:25,779
But only once did
he ever use that name.

281
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,548
I remember it clearly.

282
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:28,682
So do I.

283
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,417
[steady heartbeat]

284
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,519
[KALIFA]
Shall I show him in, sir?

285
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,322
No, turn him away.

286
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,599
[LUCCI]
In other words.

287
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:50,504
Tom's second apprentice,
Cutty Flam, is still alive...

288
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,173
And living in
this town no less.

289
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:01,048
But now, he goes by "Franky."

290
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:05,152
[rapid heartbeat]

291
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,587
[FRANKY]
What's with all the secrecy?

292
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,221
Something going on?

293
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,724
Huh?

294
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,695
Hey what're these?

295
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:17,531
The blueprints for
that old battleship?

296
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,134
[ICEBERG] Don't call
yourself Cutty Flam anymore.

297
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,502
Huh?

298
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:22,603
It's only a matter of time

299
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:25,306
before the
government targets me.

300
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:29,409
I want you to take these
and leave this island, Franky.

301
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:32,546
Seems pretty obvious now, huh?

302
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,716
[KAKU] I can't believe
it took us all these years

303
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:38,586
to figure out the connection.

304
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,654
Our searches on him
turned up nothing.

305
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,489
I must admit that
his true identity

306
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,692
was a well-hidden secret.

307
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,794
And because he's an oaf
and a ship dismantler,

308
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:49,463
we never really
gave him much thought.

309
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,800
It's ironic, really. Since we
never questioned our reports,

310
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,568
it didn't occur to
us that a dead person

311
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,704
might actually still be alive.

312
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:59,773
The setup was quite
convenient for you, I imagine.

313
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,042
Since the Franky family
often came to the shipyard

314
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,245
to sell lumber, there
were plenty of chances

315
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:06,380
to pass off the blueprints.

316
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,350
You managed it well, he was
close when you needed him,

317
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:12,253
yet always at a safe distance.

318
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:13,220
That would also explain why

319
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:15,756
you were so confident
in dealing with us.

320
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,524
You knew that we were
looking for the blueprints

321
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,460
in the wrong place.

322
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:20,728
And while it might seem strange

323
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:24,298
that your most trusted foremen
had not heard of the blueprints,

324
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,100
they couldn't possibly
be as close to you

325
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,469
as Tom's other apprentice.

326
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:31,272
From this line of thinking,
everything checks out.

327
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:32,773
Not only that.

328
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:37,077
Your racing pulse has confirmed
that our hypothesis is true!

329
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,315
C'mon, hurry!

330
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,382
[ZORO]
Hey!

331
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:44,151
You sure this's the right way?

332
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,752
Don't even go there!

333
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,258
Their injuries are pretty bad.

334
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,762
All right, that's gotta be it--

335
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:56,597
the closed door at
the end of the hallway!

336
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,432
Looks like a lotta people
got hurt guarding that door!

337
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:03,571
[ZORO]
Hmm? Uh... Hey...

338
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:04,505
What're you waiting for?

339
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,340
Cut down the door
and beat the bad guys!

340
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,474
We're right behind you!

341
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:08,608
Hurry it up!

342
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:11,579
All right, I'll do it,
but not cause you told me to!

343
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:13,180
Hey, Straw Hat! Wait!

344
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,716
[loud crash]

345
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:17,484
YAAAAAA!!

346
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,253
This is the wrong
room, you idiot!

347
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:22,188
It's the one next door!
You hear me? Ugh...

348
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:25,225
Yeah? Oh. Oops.

349
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,827
[LUCCI]
Don't blame yourself.

350
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,696
You're only human.

351
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,431
And under these circumstances,

352
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:33,534
no one would be able to hide
the truth from us for very long.

353
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,637
So just be grateful that
justice will prevail in the end.

354
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,739
Thanks so much for
the last five years.

355
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:40,708
But you've outlived
your usefulness.

356
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:43,543
Let's find Franky
before the storm hits.

357
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,479
You bastards!

358
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,116
Hm?

359
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:59,526
Give Robin back!!

360
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,527
Luffy!

361
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,062
Luffy?

362
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:05,398
You again?

363
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:19,146
Robin! I finally found you!

364
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:20,414
Hey, Luffy!

365
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,650
Where were you when we had to
beat up all those shipwrights?!

366
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:26,287
Robin! Why did you leave us?!

367
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,023
Hold on a sec.
Something's not right here.

368
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:41,234
Well, well, well...

369
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:48,108
Paulie, Straw Hat.

370
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,643
[PAULIE]
Iceberg.

371
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,444
What is this?

372
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:58,352
[PAULIE]
What the hell's going on?!

373
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:03,290
♪ ending song ♪

374
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:15,462
[LUFFY] Robin,
what're you doing

375
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,231
hanging around with
jerks like them?!

376
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:18,432
[NAMI]
Yeah!

377
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:21,101
You know they work for the
government, right? What gives?

378
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:22,069
[ROBIN]
This is goodbye.

379
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:23,437
[LUFFY]
Hey! Don't leave!

380
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,406
We're not done talking yet!

381
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:27,541
[ROBIN] I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid we are.

382
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,243
For now and evermore.

383
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:30,711
[LUFFY]
On the next <i>One Piece</i> :

384
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:34,148
"Come Back, Robin!
Showdown with CP9!"

385
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,616
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
