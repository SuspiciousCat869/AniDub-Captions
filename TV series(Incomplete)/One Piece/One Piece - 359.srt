1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,949
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:40,618
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:45,290
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:50,328
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,232
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:57,602
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,837
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:03,474
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:06,444
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,747
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:12,917
[MORIA]
Kushishishi!

48
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,919
[MORIA] You say you're
gonna kick my ass?

49
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:17,288
[LUFFY] Yep.
That's right.

50
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,924
[MORIA] Well. I say that,
but with your power.

51
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,327
I doubt you can even
lay a finger on me.

52
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,861
[MORIA]
Come, Brick Bat.

53
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:26,631
[LUFFY]
...Gatling!

54
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:32,003
[LUFFY] Damn! These things
keep blocking me!

55
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:33,938
How am I
supposed to punch him?

56
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:35,540
Haaaa...

57
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:39,644
[LUFFY yelling]

58
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,314
[PERONA] Stop running!

59
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,316
[USOPP] You stop running!

60
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,150
[KUMACY growling]

61
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,353
Get rid of that
guy already, Kumacy!

62
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:53,291
[KUMACY] I won't let you lay
a finger on Mistress Perona!

63
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,298
For such a fluffy
stuffed animal

64
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:02,467
that thing really packs
a punch, doesn't it?

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,868
He can't unzip
his own zipper,

66
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:06,904
but he sure is good
at running and wrecking stuff.

67
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:11,476
[KUMACY] Now I'm angry.

68
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:12,510
[KUMACY growls]

69
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,980
[SANJI] And skip, and skip,
and skip, and skip.

70
00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:19,684
Why, is that a Nami I see?
Get your hands off her!

71
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:24,656
[SANJI] Sorry to
keep you waiting.

72
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:26,391
Your knight has arrived.

73
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:29,360
I'm running very
low on patience.

74
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,996
I can't waste my time fighting
with some weakling like--

75
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:33,031
[ABSALOM grunts]

76
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,833
[SANJI] And you say I talk
too much, you creeper!

77
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,402
Master Absalom!

78
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:40,071
Veau Shot!

79
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,614
[SANJI] You say you're
running low on patience?

80
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:52,350
Well, I'm way
beyond that, buddy.

81
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:56,354
I'm so pissed off,
I'm about to explode!

82
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:59,691
[SANJI] And this is isn't
just about Nami, either.

83
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:02,727
Oh no. There's an issue.

84
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,730
A little something,
between the two of us.

85
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,865
That goes back a long way.

86
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:12,136
[LUFFY]
"A Clear-Clear History?

87
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:14,405
Sanji's Stolen Dream."

88
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,453
[ABSALOM panting]

89
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:57,081
[ZOMBIES gasp]

90
00:05:57,115 --> 00:05:59,117
[ZOMBIE 358B ]
He knocked him flat.

91
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,152
[SANJI growls]

92
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,122
[ABSALOM grunting]

93
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,498
Alright, let's talk about this.

94
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:15,533
You said there's an issue?

95
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:19,937
Damn straight.
For starters. You're a thief.

96
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:23,508
You stole Nami,
and you stole my dream.

97
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,144
[ABSALOM wheezing]

98
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,179
His dream?

99
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:33,117
[ABSALOM] I don't know
what you're talking about.

100
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:35,119
You've got me confused
with someone else.

101
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:37,688
We've never even met before.

102
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:43,161
But... if you want
to pick a fight with me.

103
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:47,131
We'll start with
my hands of the dead!

104
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:49,534
C'mon! I'll blow you away!

105
00:06:58,142 --> 00:06:59,977
The guns. Take 'em off.

106
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:03,147
Huh?

107
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:04,348
[SANJI] Don't play dumb.

108
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,585
Take off those bazookas you've
got strapped to your arms.

109
00:07:07,652 --> 00:07:09,487
[ABSALOM gasps]

110
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:12,657
[SANJI] I'll only
say this once.

111
00:07:12,657 --> 00:07:15,159
If Nami gets
injured in your crossfire,

112
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:16,828
by the time
I'm done with you,

113
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:21,032
you'll be twice as dead
as those zombies of yours.

114
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:24,101
Impossible. How
could he have known?

115
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,272
I tried asking you nicely.

116
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,242
Now take those
damn things off!

117
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:42,854
What the...? Bazookas?

118
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:44,722
Where did those
even come from?

119
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,525
[ABSALOM growls]

120
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:49,227
I figured it was
something like that.

121
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,563
A guy with your power's only got
so many tricks up his sleeve.

122
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,198
I know you can turn invisible,

123
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:57,301
and I know you can turn anything
you touch invisible, too.

124
00:07:57,368 --> 00:07:59,537
But that's the
extent of your powers.

125
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,574
Against me, your tactics
are as transparent as you are.

126
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,209
Because I know everything

127
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:08,045
about the Clear-Clear Fruit!

128
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:10,581
Who the hell are you?
Who told you all that?

129
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,816
This guy.

130
00:08:11,883 --> 00:08:13,985
Do you think he and Absalom
have got some kind of history?

131
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:15,953
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

132
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:17,822
He knows so much
about his powers.

133
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:20,725
And yet he has no
recollection of this grudge.

134
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,761
[SANJI] I scoured the
Devil Fruit Encyclopedia

135
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:27,598
when I was a kid. I didn't
even believe half of it.

136
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,233
And most of the fruits'
abilities didn't sound like

137
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:31,068
they were worth
the curse anyway.

138
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:32,670
Except for one.

139
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:36,007
There was one fruit
that spoke to my very soul.

140
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:37,008
And I made the decision.

141
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:39,644
If I ever had the luck
of finding that fruit.

142
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:41,746
Then I would embrace the
curse and swallow it whole,

143
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:43,748
no matter what the cost!

144
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:44,849
But of course.

145
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:48,152
There's only one of each
Devil Fruit in the entire world.

146
00:08:48,185 --> 00:08:50,121
[ABSALOM growls]

147
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,923
[SANJI] So I knew
that if I ever met

148
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:53,324
the power holder
with that ability.

149
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:56,260
My dream would be vanquished.

150
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:56,827
See what you've done?

151
00:08:56,861 --> 00:08:58,262
The only thing I wanted

152
00:08:58,296 --> 00:09:00,831
was to experience
invisibility for myself!

153
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:02,099
But you just had to go

154
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:03,768
and find the
Clear-Clear Fruit first!

155
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:06,938
You took its powers and you
stole my dream along with it!

156
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:09,774
That's why he's mad?

157
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:11,309
My dream, I saw it so clearly.

158
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,344
I could do so
much good with it.

159
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:14,211
Use it to protect...

160
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:15,179
...nude girls!

161
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:17,949
No, I mean, I could
help all mankind and...

162
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,016
...nude girls!

163
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,053
No, I had this beautiful
vision of the future and...

164
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,321
...nude girls!

165
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,189
He just wants to
peek at naked girls!

166
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:27,959
He's a complete pervert!

167
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:29,060
Shut up!

168
00:09:29,126 --> 00:09:31,362
After a lifetime of
fantasizing about that fruit,

169
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:33,998
I know how much you
can peep--no, wait, I mean,

170
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,801
I know how much you
could help humanity with it!

171
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:37,868
Understand?

172
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:40,304
[SANJI growls]

173
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:42,907
Not only did you kidnap
Nami and endanger her life,

174
00:09:42,974 --> 00:09:44,809
but you've squandered
all of the good

175
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:46,043
I could've done for this world!

176
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:51,816
Nude girls!--no, I meant wrath,
prepare to suffer my wrath!

177
00:09:51,816 --> 00:09:53,050
So that's the issue here?

178
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:56,854
You're mad I ate the Clear-Clear
Fruit before you got to find it?

179
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,991
Y'know, That's the most petty
damn thing I've ever heard!

180
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:01,767
That's the word. Petty.

181
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:08,624
[ABSALOM] You are
a jealous pervert!

182
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:12,461
[SANJI] You have no right
to call me that!

183
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:14,730
It takes one to know one!

184
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:16,465
You're right!

185
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:18,868
They're the same!
The exact same!

186
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:28,311
[ABSALOM] I'm done
listening to this nonsense!

187
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:33,983
You're taking out your
anger on the wrong guy,

188
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:36,686
and now I'm gonna give it back.

189
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,754
[ABSALOM growls]

190
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:40,990
I don't just have
the jaw of a lion.

191
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,025
I've got elephant's skin.

192
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,831
And 600 pounds of muscle
from bears and gorillas!

193
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:50,399
Dr. Hogback built this body

194
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,501
from the most savage
beasts you could imagine.

195
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:55,004
It's a savage patchwork
masterpiece of ferocity.

196
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:56,772
A masterpiece!

197
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,674
The Clear-Clear Fruit
you crave so much?

198
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,676
It's just a bonus.

199
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:01,944
Yet another weapon.

200
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,747
It's just a tool to
enhance my strength.

201
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,849
Understand?

202
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,518
[SANJI] So what?

203
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:11,554
You still peeped!

204
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:16,359
He's got a pretty
good point there!

205
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,766
[thinking] No mere human
could keep kicking me like this.

206
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,469
My body would shatter
the bones in his legs.

207
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:29,939
But he keeps on attacking me
like I'm a bag of feathers.

208
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:34,877
Hmph! But still,
the last laugh will be mine.

209
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:41,817
[ABSALOM] You wanted this
Devil Fruit power of mine,

210
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:44,153
and you want to steal
my future bride from me.

211
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,123
But face the facts,
they're both mine!

212
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:50,726
The next thing I'm taking
from you is your life!

213
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:53,662
[USOPP] Back there.
once he grabbed Nami,

214
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:57,666
she disappeared too and we
weren't able to chase after him.

215
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,568
[SANJI] So you're
comin' after Nami, huh?

216
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,737
Well you're not getting her!

217
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:07,009
[ABSALOM growls]

218
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:19,822
[ABSALOM] What are
you even looking for?

219
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:24,427
I'm invisible, moron,
but you can still feel my power.

220
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,762
The power of the jungle!

221
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:34,670
[ABSALOM] Oh, really?

222
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:37,606
You think you can save her
by sacrificing yourself?

223
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:38,874
[ABSALOM chuckles]

224
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:40,609
Well that's fine with me.

225
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:43,979
Let's see how it works out
for you! Mystery Man Handler!

226
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,015
Mystery Man Kicker!

227
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:27,990
[ABSALOM] Put her down gently
now, before you drop dead!

228
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:40,169
[SANJI] You evil bastard!

229
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,586
[SANJI grimacing]

230
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,564
[SANJI] I'm so sorry, Nami.

231
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:19,708
[ABSALOM laughing]

232
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,743
[ABSALOM] You dropped her!

233
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:24,647
Guess you don't care so
much about her after all!

234
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:26,715
[SANJI grimaces and coughs]

235
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:34,056
[SANJI] Forgive me, Nami.
You look so beautiful.

236
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:37,760
I don't wanna ruin your
white dress with blood.

237
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,062
[SANJI]
That damn coward,

238
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:43,232
using his cheap powers
to hide from me.

239
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:50,005
[SANJI] At least now I know
the reality behind my dream.

240
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:52,074
[SANJI panting and gasping]

241
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,477
[SANJI] I'm glad.

242
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:59,281
Glad I didn't find that
damned Devil Fruit after all.

243
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,250
Oh...!

244
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:05,955
[SANJI] I can peep
fine the way I am!

245
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,257
He's gonna peep after all!

246
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,294
[SANJI pants and coughs]

247
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:18,133
[ABSALOM growls while walking]

248
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,957
[ABSALOM] Let go of
me, dammit! Let go!

249
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,993
[SANJI] I've got
you now, you bastard.

250
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:48,330
With all the different animals
you've got stitched into you,

251
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:52,134
you're gonna make one
damn tasty casserole.

252
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:55,838
[ABSALOM]
I said let go of my leg!

253
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,140
Don't get cocky with me!

254
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:12,855
[SANJI] Extra Hache!

255
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:21,163
Absalom!

256
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:49,224
Nude Girls. No.
You wanted to get married?

257
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,178
I now pronounce
you man and wall.

258
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:02,371
[LUFFY] Get away from me!

259
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,511
[LUFFY] Stop it!

260
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:11,080
Kushishi!

261
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,214
Don't worry, kid.

262
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:14,349
They don't actually drink blood.

263
00:17:14,383 --> 00:17:18,353
To think. You
defeating me. Ridiculous.

264
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:24,860
[LUFFY] That's enough!

265
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,941
Rookie pirates. So cocky.

266
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,609
You fools are just
setting yourselves up

267
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,978
for your own humiliation.

268
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:46,281
Damn. Now Gum-Gum...

269
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,217
Brick Bat. Go!

270
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:07,236
Gum-Gum...

271
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:12,007
...Gatling!

272
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:29,491
Kushishishishi!

273
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,665
Bastard! You've really
pissed me off! Gum-Gum...

274
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:40,135
He jumped!
Is he trying to escape?

275
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:42,104
What a coward!

276
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:44,373
...Stamp!

277
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,616
Ahhh! You brat!
What a cheap shot!

278
00:18:54,616 --> 00:19:01,690
Ha! Your ass just got kicked!
How 'bout that?

279
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,959
[LUFFY laughs]

280
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:06,662
[PERONA running and panting]

281
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:12,634
[USOPP running and panting]

282
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:17,072
[KUMACY running and panting]

283
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:22,644
He won't stop chasing me!

284
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:24,746
If I could just figure out
how to finish him off,

285
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:27,149
I could get rid of
all the other pirates!

286
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:31,019
Damn that long-nosed jerk!

287
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:32,487
He won't stop chasing me!

288
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:34,423
If I could just figure out
how to finish him off,

289
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:36,758
I could get rid of
that snotty ghost girl!

290
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:39,394
Damn that zombie bear!

291
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,231
[KUMACY] Stop running!

292
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:45,267
Quit chasing me!
And quit running, ghost girl!

293
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:46,668
Auugh! Quit chasing me!

294
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:50,172
Hurry up and take care
of him already, Kumacy!

295
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:05,254
[KUMACY] Come back here!

296
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:08,123
I'm right behind
you, ghost girl!

297
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,192
Aaaa! No!

298
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:13,362
[KUMACY]
Quit harassing my mistress!

299
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:16,064
[KUMACY] You're scaring her!

300
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:18,100
Stop it! Go away!

301
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,137
[KUMACY] I'm coming, Mistress!

302
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:43,091
[USOPP] Fingers crossed!

303
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:59,641
[USOPP] Poke, poke,
poke, poke, poke

304
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:08,583
What kind of sick monster would
make such a violent teddy bear?

305
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,585
[KUMACY] Quit running from me!

306
00:21:15,424 --> 00:21:17,426
[USOPP] Oh, yeah, I forgot.

307
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,133
C'mon. Special Attack.
Flame Ball!

308
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:35,310
[USOPP] It worked, it worked!

309
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:37,779
You're just like
the other zombies after all!

310
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,648
[USOPP] Now let's
add a dash of oil.

311
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:41,216
For a little entrée
that I like to call

312
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:44,152
Don't-Cross-This-Line technique!

313
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,456
[KUMACY] What the...?

314
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:50,625
[USOPP] Come and get me now,
you stupid bear!

315
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:53,562
I'm brilliant! A total genius!

316
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:54,896
And now that you're
out of the equation.

317
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:56,398
Your precious mistress

318
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:58,467
kooky laughter
ghost girl is going down!

319
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:02,838
Nobody messes with the king.

320
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:08,910
Alright then, it's time to
teach that ghost girl a lesson.

321
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:13,815
Yep, a lesson in complete and
total defeat. Eh, what the..?

322
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:16,218
She was right here.

323
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:20,389
[PERONA] Looking for me?
Right this way. Horo horo horo!

324
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,557
[USOPP] Is this
some kinda trick?

325
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,427
Where is she?
Did she go outside?

326
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:27,162
No, that can't be right.

327
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:30,665
This tower's so high,
she'd have to be... Aaaaah!

328
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:36,171
[PERONA]
Horo horo horo horo!

329
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,713
What? How the hell are
you floating like that?

330
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:47,349
I thought your power
was to control ghosts?

331
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:48,950
Okay. Before we
go any further.

332
00:22:49,017 --> 00:22:52,354
I should ask.
What is your power?

333
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:53,789
That's my little secret.

334
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:56,558
No one messes
with the princess.

335
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:57,893
Oh, and by the way.

336
00:22:57,926 --> 00:22:59,761
I know how to beat you now.

337
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,396
And when I'm through with you.

338
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,531
Your friends are next.

339
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:04,466
They won't have a
chance in the world!

340
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:07,402
[NEGAtIVE GHOSTS]
Horo horo horo horo!

341
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:10,972
Oh, come on!
What the hell?

342
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,542
And everything
was going so good!

343
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:21,716
[PERONA] Is something wrong?

344
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:23,618
Not a single one
of your attacks hit me.

345
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,554
[USOPP] Hold on, here!
Which attacks can I use?

346
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:27,489
I've got sniping,
negativity, bluffing,

347
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:29,658
my 8,000 followers,
aw man, I'm screwed!

00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:32,260
Why aren't any of
my attacks working on her?

349
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:33,829
What do I do? What do I do?

00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:35,330
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

351
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:39,234
"Save Me, Hero! My Enemy

00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:41,903
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
