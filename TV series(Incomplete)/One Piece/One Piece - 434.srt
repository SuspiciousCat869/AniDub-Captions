1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,658
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,394
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,631
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,500
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,336
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,905
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,841
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,710
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,412
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,847
of the World Government,

47
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,151
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

48
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,720
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

49
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,157
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

50
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,294
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

51
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:18,831
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

52
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,370
[NARRATOR]
After being separated from Mr. 3

53
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,506
and Buggy in the
Starvation Hell.

54
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,808
Luffy and Bon Clay
continued to fight their way

55
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,176
to the lower levels.

56
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,311
[MAGELLAN]
Excluding Saldeath's,

57
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,947
I want all forces in the prison
down on Level 4, now!

58
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,882
[GUARD D] Yes, sir!
Of course, sir! Right away!

59
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,918
If Minotaurus fails us and
they do find the way down,

60
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,920
once they set foot
on this floor,

61
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,790
I will bury them
with my own hands.

62
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,927
That is a lot of smoke!

63
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,862
Don't tell me we have
to go down there?

64
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,565
Ugh! It's bad enough
up here on the ledge!

65
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,867
[BON CLAY] Alas, this is
the Burning Heat Hell

66
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,569
you so desired to visit.

67
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,906
And double alas, it lives up
to its name quite accurately.

68
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,376
Well, damn.
So, what's down there?

69
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,746
And, what're you
two doing here?

70
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,581
I thought you said you
were gonna break out!

71
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,350
Not you again, damn it!

72
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,385
I knew you'd change
your mind and come with me!

73
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,821
Screw you! I hope that
thing eats you alive!

74
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,990
Either way,
take this, you bastard!

75
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,759
My special weapon,
the Muggy Ball!

76
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,397
[mooing]

77
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,333
All right! Now, Gum-Gum!

78
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,503
Mallet Rifle!

79
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,744
[coughs]

80
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,813
[ALL] Yeah, we did it!
We really did it!

81
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,450
We beat the
monster cow thing from hell!

82
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,787
[LUFFY]
"All Forces Have Gathered!

83
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,524
The Battle on Level 4,
the Burning Heat Hell."

84
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,567
[HANCOCK] How much time is left
before they execute Ace?

85
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,269
[MOMONGA]
Twenty-nine hours.

86
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,739
It'll all be over
by 3 PM tomorrow.

87
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,574
That's the plan anyway.

88
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,511
Not that plans always go
the way they're supposed to.

89
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,982
Portgas D. Ace is safe,
for the time being.

90
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,784
We'll transfer him
in the morning.

91
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:26,826
[HANCOCK] Luffy, I pray that
you're safe more than anything.

92
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,428
That's all I want.

93
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,970
[BUGGY] All right, I'm gonna
ask you this one more time.

94
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,372
[LUFFY]
Heh?

95
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,440
After this,

96
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,942
do you still honestly
wanna go down to Level 4?

97
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,645
Yeah! I knew you
guys'd come with me.

98
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,714
There's no way you're
getting me down there.

99
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,917
I already feel like
my skin's melting off my bones.

100
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,687
What is it gonna take to make
you realize it is too damn hot?!

101
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,589
Does a boiling cauldron
of blood and fire

102
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,057
sound like a good time to you?!

103
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,560
What about "Burning Heat
Hell" don't you get?!

104
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,795
We are not going down there!

105
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,397
Aww, why?

106
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,832
It's pretty obvious!

107
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,635
We wanna go up,
not down! Up! Up!

108
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,840
Yeah, we're trying to escape
and that's up! Don't you get it?

109
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,643
Man, that is one really big
bloody booger I just picked.

110
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,613
You're not even listening!

111
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,551
[sighs] Just let 'em
run away, Straw Boy.

112
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,488
They clearly don't have the
balls to go one step further.

113
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,623
Hey, even my nose
is a damn ball!

114
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,792
Your what? Really?
That is weird.

115
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,360
Okay, we are getting
off topic here.

116
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,696
[laughing] How 'bout
you stop pulling my tail

117
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,097
and I'll get back to spinning?

118
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,465
[laughing]

119
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,601
We've got some
brilliant minds here.

120
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,975
Hey, is it just me

121
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,878
or does it look like
the ceiling is going up?

122
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,913
Ahh. Yeah, you're right, it is.

123
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:54,981
[BUGGY, BON CLAY]
Uh?

124
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,849
There's kind of a loud
rumbling too. And y'know,

125
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,519
this rushing sensation,
it sort of feels like--

126
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,790
The ceiling's not rising,
we're falling!

127
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,958
[ALL screaming]

128
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,028
Oh, no! My Muggy Ball
must've been so powerful

129
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,763
it caused the floor to collapse!

130
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:14,167
You wish! It was the force
of my Heavy Kick that did it!

131
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,301
You're both wrong!

132
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,805
It's 'cuz my punch was so strong
it sent out shock waves!

133
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:22,475
No, no, no.
My Wax-Wax power--Wait.

134
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,710
I guess it didn't really
do that much actually.

135
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,045
Then shut up!

136
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,147
[BUGGY screaming]

137
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:33,386
[ALL] We're falling
into hellfire! Help us!

[PRISONERS panting]

139
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:59,011
Please, don't do this, sir!
Please, don't kill us!

140
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,681
[PRISON GUARD A] You deserve
whatever happens to you.

141
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,216
That's the way justice works.

142
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,586
How many people have
begged you not to kill them?

143
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,687
It's over.

144
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,189
[PRISONER C] But, we deeply
regret what we've done!

145
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,658
[PRISONER A]
Yeah! We're sorry, honestly!

146
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,127
--No, please don't!
--[PRISONERS yelling]

147
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,735
[PRISONERS screaming]

148
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,205
[PRISONER A]
Ughh! It burns!

149
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,542
--I'm burning!
--[PRISONER C] Help me!

150
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,979
[PRISON GUARD B]
Keep moving! Lug that firewood!

151
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,180
[PRISONER H groans]

152
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,682
It's too hot. My body.

153
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,252
Even my guts are burning.

154
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,921
I'd rather die
than put up with this.

155
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,890
I'm running for it!

156
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:44,891
[PRISON GUARD C gasps, grunts]

157
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,094
Get out of my damn way!
I'm through with this!

158
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,695
[PRISONER I yells]

159
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,998
[PRISON GUARD D]
We've got a prisoner escaping!

160
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,132
[panting]

161
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,835
Hey! Move it!

162
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,869
[PRISON H grunts]

163
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,075
Go on, or you wanna get
thrown into the hellfire?

164
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,749
[groaning]

165
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,050
[PRISONER H]
I'm falling!

166
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,754
[PRISONER H screaming]

167
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:15,788
What the hell?

168
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,057
You can't just kill
other prisoners like that!

169
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,159
You want us to
execute you right here?

170
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,572
[gasps]

171
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:42,832
Your condition's been granted.
As for your end of the--

172
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:45,434
I'm aware of the deal.

173
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:48,871
I made a promise to you,
and I intend to live up to it.

174
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:51,440
[MARINE A]
Welcome back, sir!

175
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:55,144
It is very good to be back.
Show her to her quarters.

176
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,213
[MARINE A]
Yes, sir. This way.

177
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:01,150
I'll bring your dinner
immediately.

178
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,619
[HANCOCK] No need.
Reduce my servings from now on.

179
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:05,921
Uh. Are you certain about that?

180
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:09,292
How dare you question me.
Such insolence.

181
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:10,593
[grunts]

182
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:12,428
My apologies, madam.

183
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:14,864
[CAPTAIN A panting]

184
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,198
[CAPTAIN A]
Vice Admiral!

185
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,567
Yes, what now?

186
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:20,269
[CAPTAIN A]
We just received a report

187
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:22,538
that Red-Hair had
a run-in in the New World!

188
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:25,541
[MOMONGA] Shanks?
Are you sure about that one?

189
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:27,743
The timing doesn't
make much sense.

190
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:30,479
Who did they say he was
fighting? Not one of us?

191
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:32,815
[CAPTAIN A]
No, Kaido of the Four Emperors.

192
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:35,384
[grunts] Did you say Kaido?

193
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:38,688
That's correct, sir. Apparently,
Kaido was after White Beard.

194
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,724
I hear it was just a skirmish,
but Shanks intercepted him.

195
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:44,260
I can't say to what end, though.

196
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:47,330
[MOMONGA]
Bad tidings, but not unexpected.

197
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:49,799
These are
turbulent waters indeed.

198
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:52,201
And a brush like this
with the Four Emperors?

199
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,471
That's a deadly serious
circumstance beyond our control.

200
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:59,575
With Whitebeard safe,
he'll likely come after us.

201
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:02,778
I fear it may be all out war.

202
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:08,651
You think his response
will be that extreme, sir?

203
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,620
[MOMONGA]
Whitebeard's men make up

204
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:14,457
the strongest pirate
crew in the world.

205
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,294
He'd be facing the entire Navy,
including three Admirals,

206
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:21,297
and the Seven Warlords
of the Sea.

207
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,969
No matter who comes out on top,

208
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:30,306
this war will shape
the very course of history.

209
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:34,009
[MOMONGA]
Set sail for Marineford!

210
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:35,311
[CAPTAIN A]
Yes, sir!

211
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,414
What the hell's goin' on?

212
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,549
The entire upper brass
showed up here.

213
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,386
Magellan, Hannyabal,
and the Demon Guards.

214
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,921
I got a bad feelin'
somethin's about to go down.

215
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,390
[PRISONER GUARDS groaning]

216
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:49,291
[PRISON GUARD F]
This is murder.

217
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:50,793
[PRISON GUARD G]
Fasten your fireproof coat!

218
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:54,330
Straw Hat Luffy and the others
should be coming out this door.

219
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:56,332
No updates so far.

220
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:59,635
That's good. Maybe they already
got beaten by Minotaurus.

221
00:12:02,037 --> 00:12:04,807
A true Warden should face
adversity instead of hiding.

222
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,842
Get your ugly mug out here!

223
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:08,544
[MAGELLAN screaming]

224
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:11,981
Could you warn me first?
It's too bright!

225
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:14,383
[HANNYABAL] When you inevitably
pass this seat on to me,

226
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,752
I'd appreciate it if you
made it more open, first.

227
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:19,388
[MAGELLAN] Shut up. This seat
was custom-made to my liking,

228
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:22,491
and I like it...
closed, private, and dark.

229
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:25,428
It's a metaphor for
how I feel about you.

230
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:27,363
[MAGELLAN grunts]

231
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,298
It's coming!

232
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:31,634
Huh?

233
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:34,036
[MAGELLAN farts]

234
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:35,337
[HANNYABAL]
Ew.

235
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:40,376
[toilet flushing]

236
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:44,413
Whaaaaaat?! It's a toilet!

237
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:47,082
That is gross!

238
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:48,350
[MAGELLAN]
I can hear you!

239
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:49,385
[HANNYABAL yelps]

240
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:54,857
Aww, if I had known
we were just gonna be

241
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,793
standing around and waiting
for them for this long,

242
00:12:57,827 --> 00:12:59,829
then I would have gone hunting.

243
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,064
[MAGELLAN] Patience,
Mistress Sadie, please.

244
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:03,933
Oh, it doesn't bother me.

245
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:05,701
But my boys here.

246
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:08,838
They don't know
what patience is.

247
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,540
The only thing they know
is blood lust.

248
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,805
[PRISON GUARD J]
I have an update!

249
00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:43,806
[HANNYABAL screams]

250
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,608
[PRISON GUARD J]
Straw Hat Luffy and the others

251
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:48,444
are now located inside
the Well Tower on Level 3.

252
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:51,447
Which means, we're unfortunately
unable to monitor them.

253
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,715
They've made it that far?!

254
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,716
If they pull this off,

255
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,452
all I have to do is lay
the blame on the warden

256
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:58,153
then I'll be--Ugh!

257
00:13:58,187 --> 00:14:00,155
It's not fair!

258
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:02,525
I really wanna be warden!

259
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:04,860
Uh! I mean, I love your chair.

260
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:06,629
[MAGELLAN growls]

261
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:08,631
[MAGELLAN] It'd make our lives
a hell of a lot easier

262
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:12,568
if they simply plummeted
to their deaths from there.

263
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,671
The boiling Pool of Blood
is right beneath them.

264
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:18,173
They all have
Devil Fruit powers, after all.

265
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:20,876
They'd conveniently
sink like stones.

266
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,479
If I die here,
it's all your fault, Straw Hat!

267
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:26,148
I don't wanna go to Level 4,
it's hot enough already!

268
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:29,818
Speaking of hot, we're headed
for the Pool of Blood!

269
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:32,087
Man, this sucks!

270
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:38,377
[ALL screaming]

271
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,300
[PRISON GUARD K panting]

272
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,203
Warden Magellan! Another update!

273
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,237
[MAGELLAN]
Huh?

274
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,274
[PRISON GUARD K]
I'm afraid that Straw Hat Luffy

275
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,643
has already reached this level!

276
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:15,047
He didn't pass us!
How is that possible?!

277
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,283
He apparently fell down here
through the well.

278
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,952
[PRISON GUARDS chattering]

279
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,488
But the well leads directly
to the Pool of Blood.

280
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,456
How the hell are they alive?

281
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,025
From what I've gathered,

282
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,327
they used a massive piece
of the falling floor

283
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,196
to shield themselves
and leap to safety.

284
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,365
[MAGELLAN] The bastards
have luck on their side.

285
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,633
One more thing!

286
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,501
What now?

287
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,936
It stinks, Warden!

288
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,339
Ahem. I mean,
this situation, it stinks, huh.

289
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,507
--[MAGELLAN growls]
--[HANNYABAL yelps]

290
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,608
Well, sir.

291
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,677
The demon guard, Minotaurus,
also fell into the well

292
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,178
and apparently he's not moving.

293
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,914
Impossible! They defeated him?

294
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,518
[PRISON GUARD K]
It appears so.

295
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,988
[SADIE] The poor baby!
I won't believe it!

296
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,122
[SADIE whining]

297
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,290
[MAGELLAN]
Pull it together!

298
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,325
[SADIE gasps]

299
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,363
[MAGELLAN] You will follow
my orders carefully.

300
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,432
There are only two ways
to get out of Level 4

301
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,666
that don't include dying.

302
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,368
We have two staircases
they can take

303
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:13,172
that aren't currently protected
by security guards.

304
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,039
From this point forward,

305
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,508
we're splitting
our forces into three.

306
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,645
Hannyabal, I want you
in charge of this stairwell.

307
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,747
Block all access to Level 3.

308
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,083
Mistress Sadie, I want
you and the Demon Guards

309
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,086
to defend the stairwell
leading to Level 5.

310
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:31,991
No way! That sounds so boring!
I wanna punish those bad boys!

311
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,327
Surely my outfit makes
that clear enough to you!

312
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,129
[HANNYABAL] Maybe I'll just
let them slip past me

313
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,998
and have the Warden
take the blame.

314
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,234
Any objections?

315
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:46,105
Please, Warden!
Ohhh. Don't do that!

316
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,307
But I didn't complain this time!

317
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,410
You don't need to. I can sense
you plotting against me.

318
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,179
Oh, and once they're captured,

319
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,515
you're free to do
as you wish with them.

320
00:16:56,548 --> 00:17:00,652
Ohh! Yes, sir!
I can get behind that idea.

321
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,521
And, as for the rest
of the guards,

322
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,790
I want you to pursue them
at all costs.

323
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,159
You bring them to me,
dead or alive!

324
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,494
[ALL]
Sir!

325
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,428
[SADIE squeals]

326
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,629
Almost dead works, too!

327
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:14,199
This ends right now. They have
toyed with me long enough.

328
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,168
We have a reputation to uphold.

329
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,204
The Burning Heat Hell
shall be their last stop.

330
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,375
But first...

331
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:27,046
[PRISON GUARD L] The warden's
about to unleash his power!

332
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,081
[growling]

333
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,653
[ALL gasping]

334
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:38,157
[whimpers]

335
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,826
[ALL]
You're dumping again?!

336
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,560
[MAGELLAN farts]

337
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,495
[BUGGY]
Damn it! Ow, ow, ow, ow!

338
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,531
The floor is
insanely hot in here!

339
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,600
[MR. 3] It's so hot my lungs
feel like they're full of fire!

340
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,270
[LUFFY] Faster we move, the
faster we get out of this place!

341
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,671
Now, which way should we go?

342
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,139
[laughing]

343
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,142
You guys sound
like babies! Whiny babies!

344
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,778
It's mind over matter! Just
pretend the fire's your friend!

345
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,314
Honestly, I can't really
blame you, though!

346
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,116
I do admit it's
a little steamy in here,

347
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,851
even compared to that desert.

348
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:09,388
Actually, maybe more
than just a little.

349
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,322
[BON CLAY groaning]

350
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,392
My friend the fire
might be turning on me.

351
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,359
[groaning]

352
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,128
Oh, crap!

353
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,764
Your blathering is worse
than the damn heat!

354
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,165
[LUFFY]
Huh?

355
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,433
[sniffs]

356
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,402
[gasps] I know which way!

357
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,436
Follow me!

358
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,406
Hey! Where're you going?

359
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,241
[BON CLAY]
So hot!

360
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,310
We're aware of that!

361
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,548
Huh. Now where could our
little Straw Boy be leading us?

362
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,156
Of course, to the kitchen!

363
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,491
[laughing]

364
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:50,529
Good, because I'm famished!
Wait for me, old chum!

365
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,698
I'm not gonna lie,
food does sound good!

366
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,133
Kinda hoping for
some booze, too!

367
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,201
[MR. 3]
No! Wait a minute, Buggy!

368
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,336
[BUGGY grunts]

369
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,407
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!
That food smells so good.

370
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,810
Hot, hot, hot, hot! Oh, boy, I
can't wait for yummy food time.

371
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:05,878
[PRISON GUARD M]
There he is!

372
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,646
It's Straw Hat Luffy!

373
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,217
[LUFFY]
Damn. There's a bunch of 'em.

374
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,787
All this heat's beatin' me down.

375
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,490
But I'll get my energy back
once I get some food in me!

376
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,626
Stop right there!

377
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,894
[LUFFY grunts]

378
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,164
[PRISON GUARDS yelping]

379
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,899
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum!

380
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,200
[ALL gasping]

381
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,670
[yelps]

382
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,506
[LUFFY]
Fireworks!

383
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,277
[PRISON GUARDS screaming]

384
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,648
We have found
Straw Hat Luffy, sir!

385
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,716
Team A's locked
in battle with him now!

386
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,719
Team B has just arrived, too!

387
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,689
They've joined up with Team A
and they're closing in on him!

388
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,225
They don't seem to be
holding up too well, though.

389
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,195
[PRISON GUARD Q] Both teams are
requesting to send backup, sir!

390
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,329
What should we do?

391
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,899
[MAGELLAN growling]

392
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,536
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum... Whip!

393
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,938
[PRISON GUARDS screaming]

394
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,407
[BON CLAY] A round and
around and around I go!

395
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,445
"Oh, Come My Way" Kenpo!
Memoirs of a Summer's Day!

396
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,582
[PRISON GUARDS screaming]

397
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,817
[PRISON GUARD K] A and B teams
have been wiped out!

398
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,486
C, D, and E have major losses!

399
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,622
[PRISON GUARD Q] Extra backup
from upstairs won't cut it!

400
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,658
They're too powerful for us!
We can't hold the position!

401
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,494
[MAGELLAN growling]

402
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,898
[MAGELLAN growls]

403
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:37,369
Oh, woe is me! If I only
I were Warden, I could fix this!

404
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,537
[screams]

405
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,607
[PRISON GUARDS chatter]

406
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,483
[growling]

407
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,684
[ALL gasp]

408
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,720
[whimpering]

409
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,457
[growling]

410
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,294
[BUGGY] What're you
freakin' out about, partner?

411
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,862
[MR. 3]
Open your eyes and take a look!

412
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:04,863
[BUGGY]
Heh?

413
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,131
[MR. 3] There's an ocean
of guards down there!

414
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:09,935
And think, this level is devoted
to the agony of the prisoners.

415
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,405
Yet, there's not a single guard
manning the fire torture pit.

416
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,774
[PRISONERS screaming]

417
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,547
[PRISON GUARD R]
Let's go! Get a move on!

418
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,617
The first thing we should do
is to check the staircases.

419
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,819
I've got a feeling
they ambushed us.

420
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:28,754
With all these guards,

421
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,889
they probably boxed us in
on this level.

422
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,090
[grunts]

423
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,526
But, if they've been waiting
on Level 4 this whole time,

424
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,295
that means they
just want Straw Hat!

425
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,664
We weren't even trying
to come down here!

426
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,667
Maybe not, but we are
still trying to break out

427
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,935
and they do know
our names and faces.

428
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,938
Still, there's something
even more troubling.

429
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,408
If they're sending this
many guards after us,

430
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,576
it's extremely likely
they're also sending

431
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,847
in the Impel Down all-stars
to put an end to this chaos.

432
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:56,982
And I'm not
just talking about

433
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,418
the other three
Demon Guards either.

434
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,689
Warden Magellan himself
might make an appearance,

435
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,925
and then, we're dead, my friend.

436
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,631
[LUFFY]
Get outta my way!

437
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,732
[yelling]

438
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,368
--[PRISON GUARDS yeling]
--Why don'tcha just give up?

439
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:19,071
Quit blockin' the food!

440
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,306
[LUFFY yelps]

441
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,410
[LUFFY]
Whoa! Freaked me out.

442
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,913
I thought it was a spear
or somethin' headin' at me.

443
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,081
What is that?

444
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,416
[LUFFY grunting]

445
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,087
[LUFFY] Ah, geez, gross!
Is it jelly or poop?

446
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,557
[BON CLAY]
Huh?

447
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,559
Oh no, look!

448
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:41,593
[LUFFY]
Huh?

449
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,396
[LUFFY grunting]

450
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,367
[BON CLAY screaming]

451
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,502
[MAGELLAN] It's time to put
an end to your buffoonery

452
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,637
once and for all, boy!

453
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,106
Who're you?

454
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,543
It's... Magellan!

455
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,145
[gasps]

456
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:04,549
I've got you now,
you criminal scum!

457
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,727
[NARRATOR]
Magellan finally reveals himself

458
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,697
and Luffy stands up to his
fearsome Venom-Venom power,

459
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,767
even knowing that a single touch
of the warden's deadly poison

460
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,001
could lead to his death.

461
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,037
When Bon Clay cowers before
the might of Magellan's hydra,

462
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,672
is it a show of weakness

463
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,575
or is the situation
truly hopeless after all?

464
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,177
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

465
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,447
"Mighty Magellan!
Bon Clay Bugs Out."

466
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,883
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
