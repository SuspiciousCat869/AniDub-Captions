1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,655
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:38,258
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,661
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:44,330
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,167
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose
body turned to rubber

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,602
after eating the
Gum-Gum Fruit, sets sail

43
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,905
to become the next
King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,275
As Luffy and his crew conquer
numerous obstacles, they capture

45
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,844
the unwanted attention
of the World Government,

46
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,214
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

47
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,684
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

48
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,887
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

49
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,257
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

50
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:16,196
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

51
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,900
[NARRATOR] After landing
on the Sabaody Archipelago,

52
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,536
Luffy and the Straw Hat crew
succeeded in rescuing

53
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,471
the kidnapped mermaid, Camie.

54
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,409
Soon afterward, however, a
battle with the Marines began.

55
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,811
We'll help you guys
get outta here!

56
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,214
[NARRATOR] After a wild
scramble they found themselves

57
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,950
in the clear, for
the time being.

58
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,455
[LUFFY]
Roger and Rayleigh!

59
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,625
The King of the Pirates
and His Right Hand Man!

60
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,396
[HOUND PET 400A]
Peterman! Boss, Say something!

61
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,632
How dare they do this to you!

62
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,400
Damn those guys!

63
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,437
You know what...

64
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,740
I never expected Duval to be
so handsome under that mask.

65
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,978
[DUVAL laughing]

66
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,981
Well, see ya! Feel free
to call us anytime!

67
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,984
We'll be there whenever you
need us until you're safely

68
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,486
on your way to Fishman Island!

69
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,421
[LUFFY]
Sounds good! Thanks, you guys!

70
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,023
Hey, ain't no thing, buddy!

71
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,626
Yeah. Enough with the winking.

72
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,529
Oh, I forgot.

73
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,598
For you, Miss Mermaid.

74
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,799
[CAMIE]
Hey, you found my backpack!

75
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,270
[DUVAL] Indeed! That
idiot Peterman had it.

76
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,440
[CAMIE giggles]
Thank you!

77
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,013
Alright! Let's go,
Rosy Life Riders!

78
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,982
[FISH RIDERS]
Yes, Handsome Rosy!

79
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,285
They sure shout a
bunch of weird stuff.

80
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,887
Probably trying to find
something that clicks.

81
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,459
Here we are. Let's hurry inside.

82
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,895
[CHOPPER] Sounds good.
We need to get Hachi to a bed.

83
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,898
[RAYLEIGH]
Hey, Shakky! Are you here?

84
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,633
Open up!

85
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,870
[SHAKKY]
Oh, it's Ray! Welcome back!

86
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,071
I wasn't expecting you.

87
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,741
Or rather, I wasn't expecting
them to find you so fast.

88
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,477
Hachi was seriously
injured in the escape.

89
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,512
Do you have a bed?

90
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,814
That looks terrible! Hold on.

91
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,983
I'll throw something
together for him.

92
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,052
Hey, old guy.

93
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,587
You said you had something
to tell me, right?

94
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,658
Hm?

95
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,996
[LUFFY yells]
You were on Gold Roger's crew?

96
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,733
I was. In fact, I served
as his vice-captain.

97
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:37,337
The name is Silvers Rayleigh.
It's nice to meet you.

98
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,505
[ALL]
Vice-Captain?

99
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,941
Hm?

100
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,509
[SHAKKY]
Why didn't you tell them?

101
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,510
Slip your mind?

102
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,412
[HACHI] We only needed
him to coat the boat,

103
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,613
so I didn't think about it.

104
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,516
Wait. You didn't
know who he was?

105
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,885
Not his face. But I
sure know his name!

106
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,022
[NAMI sobbing] He's in so
many books. He's legendary!

107
00:05:56,055 --> 00:06:00,026
It's definitely a name
everyone's heard at least once.

108
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,895
Gold Roger...

109
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,698
I seem to remember a rookie
with that name long ago,

110
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,033
but I'm not sure, really.

111
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,435
So how do a big-shot
pirate and an octopus

112
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,436
know each other?

113
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,304
Hachi rescued me.

114
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,606
I was stranded at sea
and he found me.

115
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,875
That was over 20 years ago,
but I'll never forget it

116
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,143
for as long as I live.

117
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,413
[SHAKKY] Hachi was still just
a little kid when it happened.

118
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,582
But he saved Rayleigh's life.

119
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,717
[RAYLEIGH] We remained good
friends after that incident,

120
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,652
until he joined up
with the Sun Pirates.

121
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,921
[LUFFY]
You mean Arlong, right?

122
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:34,894
It's hard to believe.

123
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,564
I mean, Gold Roger was executed
22 years ago, wasn't he?

124
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,733
How did his Vice-Captain
avoid getting his head

125
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,569
chopped off, too?

126
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,773
The Marines captured the
entire crew, didn't they?

127
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,850
[CHOPPER gulps]

128
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,695
The Marines didn't catch Roger.

129
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,965
[LUFFY muffled grunt]
[SANJI gasps]

130
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,835
See, the Captain
turned himself in.

131
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,870
[ALL gasp]

132
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,105
[RAYLEIGH]
The government made it sound

133
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,475
like they'd caught him, though.
Likely just to look tough.

134
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,544
"Rattling their sabers",
if you will.

135
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,614
[NAMI] The "King of the Pirates"
turned himself in? Why?

136
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,787
[RAYLEIGH] Because he saw the
inevitable end to our journey.

137
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,827
See, about 4 years
before his execution,

138
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,895
Roger began to feel ill.

139
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,632
Turned out, he had
developed a fatal disease.

140
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,900
[ALL gasp]

141
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,504
No matter how strong he was, the
illness he had was incurable.

142
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,073
He knew that he would
submit to it eventually.

143
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,709
But, there was one man
with the skill and know-how

144
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,478
to help ease his suffering.

145
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,980
A lighthouse keeper and
well-respected doctor.

146
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,517
A man residing at the
Twin Capes named Crocus.

147
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,052
Huh?

148
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,988
[RAYLEIGH] We asked for
his help and brought him on

149
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,091
as the ship's doctor
for our final voyage.

150
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,228
Finally, three years later,
while managing to keep

151
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,164
the disease at bay, Roger
achieved what was said

152
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:24,295
to be impossible.
He conquered the Grand Line.

153
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:42,255
Did you say Crocus?
At the Twin Capes?

154
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,724
Oh, that takes me back!

155
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,727
Whoa! That's crazy!
I thought the old man

156
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,096
just lived at the
lighthouse for 50 years!

157
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,665
But he sailed with the
King of the Pirates.

158
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:53,699
[NAMI]
Come to think of it.

159
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,936
He did mention being a
ship's doctor for a while!

160
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,872
So he was a pirate on your
crew for those three years?

161
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,508
Oh, I have to assume
you've met him then.

162
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,844
It's good to know that
he's alive and well!

163
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,014
Crocus agreed to join with us
because there was a certain

164
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,183
group of pirates he wanted to
search for on the Grand Line.

165
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,020
Brook! I bet he was
talking about your crew!

166
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,022
Guess it's a small
world after all!

167
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,559
Crocus, you sweet man!
You went to such lengths!

168
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,627
Yes, he was only a
crewmember with us

169
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,695
for those three years.

170
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,698
But we definitely considered
him one of our own.

171
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:31,070
It's been such a long time,
it'd be great to see him again.

172
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,707
[SANJI] So, what happened
after Roger conquered the sea?

173
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,579
[RAYLEIGH]
That's when it all began.

174
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,949
The world starting calling Roger
the "King of the Pirates".

175
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:46,886
Before that, no one had ever
called him the king of anything.

176
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,094
[RAYLEIGH] Honestly, titles
don't hold much meaning

177
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,163
for a man about to die.

178
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,902
Still. Roger was
overjoyed to hear it.

179
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,910
[RAYLEIGH] Whatever he did,
he loved doing it

180
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,312
in a bold and flashy way.

181
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,915
Whether it was in
battle or celebration,

182
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,284
he enjoyed living
life to the fullest.

183
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,753
He seemed to take pleasure
in thinking out plans for the

184
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:24,991
future as well, even though
he wouldn't be a part of it.

185
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,293
Eventually, as per
Captain's orders,

186
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,329
the Roger Pirates were
secretly disbanded.

187
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,299
One by one, everyone
discretely left the crew

188
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,267
and went their own way.

189
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,339
As comrades, we risked
our lives together.

190
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,109
But I know next to nothing
about where they are

191
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,111
or what they're doing now.

192
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,883
[RAYLEIGH] Then, about a
year after we disbanded,

193
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,153
Roger turned himself in
and was incarcerated.

194
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,622
Shortly after, it was
announced that he would

195
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,358
be publicly executed in
Loguetown, the settlement

196
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,961
in the East Blue
where he was born.

197
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,141
[RAYLEIGH] I've heard that
many of the young faces

198
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,344
that bore witness in the
town square that fateful day

199
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:23,649
went on to make names for
themselves on the high seas.

200
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,318
There was a silence that
covered the entire world

201
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,888
the day of his execution.

202
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,768
I wasn't there in
attendance, myself.

203
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,175
But I hear that his final words

204
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,677
went a little
something like this:

205
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:19,138
While they may execute
me, I won't die.

206
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,379
[RAYLEIGH] The World
Government and the Marines

207
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,383
must've been shocked.
With one last remark from Roger,

208
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,787
the public execution that was
meant to serve as an example

209
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,223
and a warning to other
pirates, instead became

210
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,391
the opening ceremony
to what would become

211
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,794
the Great Pirate Era!

212
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:47,967
If anyone wants my treasure,
then it's yours for the taking!

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,236
Go find it!

214
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,906
I left everything I
gathered in one place.

215
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,777
[RAYLEIGH] In seconds,
he changed the dim flame

216
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,079
of his life into
a raging hellfire

217
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,248
that spread across the world!

218
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:10,790
[CITIZENS cheering]

219
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:15,094
[RAYLEIGH]
I've never laughed as much...

220
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,496
Nor have I cried as much...

221
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,167
Nor drank as much
as I did that night.

222
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,435
The Captain was
an amazing man,

223
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,839
and he sure lived
one hell of a life.

224
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,399
[NAMI, USOPP sigh]

225
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,302
I'd heard it before,
but it's still so amazing.

226
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,237
When one of Roger's
old friends tells it,

227
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,573
it's like it's a
whole new story.

228
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,808
Wait. It sounds like
you're trying to say

229
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,344
that Roger created the
Great Pirate Era on purpose!

230
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:11,016
That, I couldn't tell ya.
No way to know for sure.

231
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,352
Roger is no longer with us.

232
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,055
It's only the people
who are living now

233
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,924
who can create and
shape such an era.

234
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,063
I'm certain that there
are people who inherited

235
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,066
that spirit of adventure from
Roger that fateful day

236
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,567
in the town square.

237
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,569
Your good friend Shanks
is probably one of them.

238
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,239
[LUFFY muffled] Whoa! You
know Shanks, too, old man?

239
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:37,243
Perhaps you've heard of a pirate
named Buggy from the East Blue.

240
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,911
[NAMI, ZORO grunt]

241
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,512
[NAMI, ZORO]
Buggy?

242
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,448
He and Shanks
served us well.

243
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,950
They were both apprentices
onboard Roger's ship.

244
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,520
Whoa! You mean Shanks was on
the King of the Pirate's ship?

245
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:53,392
Hm? I take it he
never told you, then?

246
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,060
[RAYLEIGH]
I ran into him again.

247
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,364
Right here on this archipelago
about 10 years ago.

248
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,466
I noticed he lost his
trademark straw hat,

249
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,534
as well as losing his left arm.

250
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,103
[LUFFY gags]

251
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,905
[RAYLEIGH] When I asked
him what had happened,

252
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,073
he spoke about you with a smile.

253
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,379
[SHANKS] I was shocked,
Rayleigh. I couldn't believe it!

254
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,915
In the East Blue,
there's a kid who said

255
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,417
the same thing
Captain Roger said.

256
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,053
His spirit lives on in him.

257
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:25,991
And ever since, I've always
wanted to meet you, Luffy.

258
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,127
And see this spirited
boy for myself.

259
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,062
[LUFFY laughs]

260
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,167
Aw, Shanks!

261
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,569
[RAYLEIGH] But I can't in good
conscience talk about things

262
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,940
involving Shanks that he
hasn't mentioned yet himself.

263
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,943
In any case, you've done
well to make it this far.

264
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,445
I'm sure Shanks is eagerly
awaiting your arrival

265
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,080
in the New World.

266
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,083
Really? Do you think so?

267
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,285
Man, I can't wait to see him!

268
00:15:57,953 --> 00:15:58,847
[RAYLEIGH chuckles]
Now then.

269
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,468
Getting down to business,
I believe you wanted

270
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,203
your ship coated, right?

271
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:05,706
Then it's high time for me
to return to my real work.

272
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:09,209
[HACHI] That reminds me: I
wasn't sure exactly how much

273
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:10,210
the coating would cost.

274
00:16:10,244 --> 00:16:12,313
[RAYLEIGH] Ah, don't you
worry about it, Hachi.

275
00:16:12,313 --> 00:16:14,515
I couldn't possibly take
money from friends of yours.

276
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:17,184
[HACHI] Oh, wow.
You're the best, Rayleigh.

277
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:18,252
[USOPP, NAMI cheering]

278
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:20,688
Not sure why, but he's
doing it for free! Thanks!

279
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:24,158
We certainly appreciate it.
That's very generous of you!

280
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,327
[NAMI]
We just saved a ton of money!

281
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:36,070
[ALL]
Huh?

282
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:39,440
[ROBIN]
Rayleigh. I have a question.

283
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:46,547
What exactly is the "Will of D"?

284
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,682
There was a Poneglyph
on Sky Island.

285
00:16:48,682 --> 00:16:53,053
Roger's name was inscribed on it
in that ancient form of writing.

286
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:56,056
How does he know it?
How can he use that language?

287
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,459
[GOLD ROGER] I made it here,
and I will guide this passage

288
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:01,061
all the way to the
farthest ends of the earth.

289
00:17:01,095 --> 00:17:03,397
Pirate Gol D. Roger...

290
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,066
Please tell me. Did you learn
what happened to the world

291
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,301
during the Blank Century?

292
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:10,070
The missing history
from 900 years ago?

293
00:17:17,778 --> 00:17:20,147
Yes. We know.

294
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:22,383
[ROBIN gasps]

295
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,051
[RAYLEIGH]
We learned all of it.

296
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,320
The entirety of
the missing history.

297
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:28,655
[ROBIN shaky gasp]

298
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:36,430
[RAYLEIGH]
But, Miss...

299
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:38,832
You mustn't be so hasty.

300
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:42,403
Just keep moving forward.
See, this is your journey now.

301
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,638
We, and Ohara, might
have hurried too much

302
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:46,073
for our own good.

303
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,510
I'm sure that's not what
you wanted to hear...

304
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:51,812
Even if I told you everything
you wanted to know

305
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:55,349
about that history here
and now, just as you are,

306
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,518
you couldn't do
anything about it.

307
00:17:57,584 --> 00:18:00,354
Once you've taken the time
to really see the world,

308
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:02,089
it might change your outlook.

309
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,658
And possibly lead you
to a different answer.

310
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:07,761
But if you still
insist on hearing it.

311
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,265
I can tell you everything.
It's up to you.

312
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:21,775
[ROBIN]
No. I'll pass.

313
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,379
And continue my journey.

314
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:28,449
It'll all make sense to
you one of these days.

315
00:18:28,449 --> 00:18:30,184
I'm very sorry
for what happened

316
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:33,353
in your homeland of Ohara.

317
00:18:33,387 --> 00:18:35,222
But, that doesn't change
the fact that Roger

318
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,624
didn't decipher that writing.

319
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,462
We were all pirates, remember?
Not geniuses or scholars.

320
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,731
No match for Clover or the
other great minds of Ohara.

321
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:47,468
See, Captain Roger
just heard the voice

322
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,538
of the universe, and
that's all that happened.

323
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,509
Are you sure about this, Robin?

324
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:58,312
Seems like you're passing
up a pretty big opportunity!

325
00:18:58,312 --> 00:19:01,315
Hey! Old guy! I've got
a question of my own!

326
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:03,750
The treasure Roger talked about.
The legendary One Piece!

327
00:19:03,817 --> 00:19:04,685
Tell me, is it really--?

328
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:09,690
That's enough!

329
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:15,362
[USOPP grunts]
[LUFFY panting]

330
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:20,667
I don't wanna know where
the One Piece is hidden.

331
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,370
I don't even wanna
know if it exists!

332
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:25,672
Every single one of us
put our life on the line

333
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,908
and set out to sea
without knowing anything!

334
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:30,410
I'd rather give up being
a pirate than know!

335
00:19:30,444 --> 00:19:33,347
I won't go on a
boring adventure!

336
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,584
We need to sail and
find out for ourselves!

337
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:40,454
[USOPP gasps]
Uh, sorry! Sorry! I knew that!

338
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:42,422
It just slipped out of
my mouth, that's all!

339
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:44,791
I don't wanna know either!
Ah! I just remembered! I have

340
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:47,561
"I'll Die If I Learn Anything
About The One Piece" disease!

341
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:49,730
Don't say anything,
old guy! You'll kill me!

342
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:50,864
Keep it to yourself!

343
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:52,733
[SHAKKY laughing]

344
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:55,802
Well, in that case.
let me ask you:

345
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,404
Do you think you can do it?

346
00:19:57,437 --> 00:20:00,707
The New World far surpasses
anything you can imagine.

347
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,442
Your foes will be powerful.

348
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:05,612
Knowing that, do you still think
you can rule this mighty sea?

349
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:07,281
[LUFFY grunts]

350
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,559
What? I don't wanna
"rule" anything.

351
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,727
Being King of the Pirates
is about being more

352
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,895
free than anyone!

353
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,397
Huh?

354
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:28,969
I see.

355
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:32,573
Monkey D. Luffy. I must
say, I like your style.

356
00:20:32,573 --> 00:20:35,609
[RAYLEIGH]
Your ship is in Grove #1, right?

357
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,911
I guess I'll head over there
now and get started.

358
00:20:37,911 --> 00:20:39,646
What do you plan to do anyway?

359
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,349
At any moment, an admiral
could be here looking for you.

360
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,818
[NAMI] That's right. We'll only
be a nuisance if we stay here.

361
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:47,421
So, maybe we go shopping?

362
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,655
What? Are you insane?

363
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:50,490
We're being chased by
the World Government!

364
00:20:50,524 --> 00:20:51,592
We gotta hide!

365
00:20:51,592 --> 00:20:52,659
He's got a point.

366
00:20:52,693 --> 00:20:54,928
If we stick together,
that makes us an easy target

367
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:56,096
for those Marines.

368
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:58,765
And it'll be easier for the
old guy to finish his work

369
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:01,635
if we each find somewhere
to lay low in town for a while.

370
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:03,437
Right. Then I say we split up.

371
00:21:03,437 --> 00:21:06,306
Keep track of the work and when
it's done, we meet back here.

372
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,775
Who is that guy
strategizing over there?

373
00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:10,677
'Cause it's not Zoro!

374
00:21:10,711 --> 00:21:12,813
Hey, Shakky. We have any cards?

375
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:16,016
[SHAKKY]
Yes. I believe there's one left.

376
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:18,352
[NAMI]
Whoa! This is a Vivre Card!

377
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:20,721
[RAYLEIGH] You know what it is?
That simplifies things.

378
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:23,457
Since I happen to be
a bit notorious myself.

379
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,626
I think I'll move your
ship from Grove #1

380
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:28,295
and work on it
somewhere more secluded.

381
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,497
I'll need three days to
complete the coating process.

382
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,498
[LUFFY, USOPP gasp]

383
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:32,566
Why does it take so long?

384
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:36,370
It needs time to seal,
so I can't go any faster.

385
00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:41,341
Then it's three days of survival
in the woods for us. Scary!

386
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,744
[RAYLEIGH] Let's meet at
sundown, three days from now.

387
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,646
I don't know what
grove I'll be on then,

388
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,848
so use the Vivre Cards
to find me.

389
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:49,883
Wherever it leads you,
that will be the place

390
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:53,020
where I'll be finishing the
coating and waiting for you.

391
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:55,989
It's probably a good idea for
you to pick up some supplies

392
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,659
for your underwater voyage
to Fish-Man Island.

393
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,662
Luffy, all of you,
thank you for everything!

394
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,730
You guys are awesome.

395
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:07,434
And I'm sorry. Sorry I caused
you guys so much trouble.

396
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:09,503
I owe you my life!

397
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,438
We'll show you the way
to Fish-Man Island.

398
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:12,839
Don't worry about a thing.

399
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,008
So do you best to stay
clear of the Marines.

400
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,544
Hachi. Get plenty
of bed rest, okay?

401
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:21,381
See you again in three days.
We'll be there to send you off.

402
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:23,350
See you later, nice lady!

403
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:26,586
[LUFFY]
We're up against an Admiral.

404
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,689
We need to make sure
none of us gets killed.

405
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,425
Stop saying scary
stuff like that!

406
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:34,528
Three days, huh?

407
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,862
Let's all go...

408
00:22:35,862 --> 00:22:36,963
[LUFFY]
...to the amusement park!

409
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,732
[ALL]
Ugh.

410
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:42,035
[PIRATE 400B] A Navy warship's
been spotted from the harbor!

411
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,038
[PIRATE 400A]
Oh, no! The Admiral's here!

412
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,074
[PIRATES screaming]

413
00:22:51,044 --> 00:22:52,779
[PIRATES gasp]

414
00:22:52,813 --> 00:22:55,782
[PIRATES scream]

415
00:22:55,816 --> 00:22:56,883
[PIRATE 400D screams]

416
00:22:56,883 --> 00:22:59,886
[KIZARU]
Ah, this is Kizaru.

417
00:22:59,886 --> 00:23:02,756
Uh, I've arrived on site.

418
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:04,157
Please respond.

419
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:05,892
Over.

420
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:15,736
[CHOPPER]
They say an Admiral is coming!

421
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,137
[BROOK]
Can he not, please?

422
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,139
[CHOPPER]
The last one we met was Aokiji!

423
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:21,908
He had ice Devil Fruit
powers and was super-tough!

424
00:23:21,908 --> 00:23:24,010
[BROOK] I do very
poorly with super-tough!

425
00:23:24,077 --> 00:23:25,846
Perhaps someone
else can handle this!

426
00:23:25,912 --> 00:23:28,014
[CHOPPER, BROOK]
Luffy!

427
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:29,916
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

428
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,017
"No Escape?

429
00:23:31,084 --> 00:23:33,653
Admiral Kizaru's
Light Speed Kick!"

430
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:35,856
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
