00:02:34.877 --> 00:02:37.515
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.454
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.487 --> 00:02:45.598
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.003
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.409
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:53.313
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.819
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:58.591
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.832
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:04.401
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:08.577
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:12.952
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:18.229
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors,

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:20.333
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law,

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:24.442
intending to destroy a Devil
Fruit Factory in Dressrosa.

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:27.582
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:27.615 --> 00:03:30.453
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:31.222 --> 00:03:32.525
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.030
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:37.000
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.906
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:45.117
[LAW]
What did you do?

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.654
[DOFLAMINGO]
Right now, beneath the skin,

00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:49.092
my strings are
reconstructing the organs

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:51.630
you so rudely damaged.

00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:54.334
Just takes a little creativity.

00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:02.686
No way!

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.958
That's the color of the
Supreme King's Haki clashing!

00:04:05.992 --> 00:04:08.597
That brat can use it, too?

00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:16.011
[LUFFY]
Go to hell! Mingo!

00:04:17.114 --> 00:04:20.120
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:04:20.153 --> 00:04:23.493
[TREBOL chuckles]

00:04:23.527 --> 00:04:26.801
[TREBOL]
Doffy's madness...

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:31.777
...will tear apart
this world at the seams!

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.889
...Eagle Bazooka!

00:04:41.964 --> 00:04:42.832
[gasps]

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:46.305
[DOFLAMINGO]
Athlete!

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.454
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:04:55.223 --> 00:04:58.964
This is a joke. Just give up!

00:05:11.156 --> 00:05:14.027
Stick-Stickem, away!

00:05:18.203 --> 00:05:21.142
[gasps] What is this stuff?

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:24.950
[TREBOL laughs]
This is just sad.

00:05:24.983 --> 00:05:28.824
A nobody like you never had
a chance of beating Doffy!

00:05:28.857 --> 00:05:30.193
Agh! Let me go!

00:05:30.226 --> 00:05:31.730
I got an ass-kicking to give!

00:05:31.763 --> 00:05:36.272
[laughs] We'll kill you
in good time, don't worry.

00:05:36.306 --> 00:05:39.779
Wait here while we
finish up with Law.

00:05:39.812 --> 00:05:41.482
Where were we?

00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:45.457
That's right!
Stomping in your head!

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.494
Doffy. Go ahead.

00:05:47.528 --> 00:05:49.498
I'll keep Straw Hat right here.

00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:53.774
Don't let that squirrely little
bastard try any more tricks.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.555
Hey! Don't ignore me!

00:06:00.588 --> 00:06:02.291
We were having a fight!

00:06:02.324 --> 00:06:04.562
Law can't even move,
you big, evil jerk!

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:06.533
I said you'll get
your turn, didn't I?

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:09.105
Lemme go, you weirdo!
Why are you so icky?

00:06:09.138 --> 00:06:10.941
I'm sticky!

00:06:13.046 --> 00:06:15.918
[panting]

00:06:15.952 --> 00:06:18.758

00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:19.892
[gasps]

00:06:26.405 --> 00:06:29.979
[TREBOL]
Ugh, you got me!

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:33.521
Sorry, kid, I fooled you!

00:06:33.554 --> 00:06:37.896
[laughs] It's no use!

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:39.699
What? That's not right!

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:42.338
Armament Haki
should work on Logia!

00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:44.007
[TREBOL]
Ain't that funny!

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:47.682
But what makes you so sure
I'm a Logia-type?

00:06:47.716 --> 00:06:52.190
Whatever I am, you can't win
if you can't touch me!

00:06:52.223 --> 00:06:54.261
Rubber dummy!

00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:55.998
[LAW]
Straw Hat!

00:06:57.367 --> 00:06:59.471
Ignore him. He's trash.

00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:03.280
Just paper-mache
covered in snot.

00:07:03.313 --> 00:07:04.148
[gasps]

00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:05.417
Wha-- Wha--

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.223
What did you just call me?!

00:07:08.256 --> 00:07:10.393
When I was a kid,

00:07:10.426 --> 00:07:12.799
I was offered the Heart Throne.

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:16.172
But why would I want to be
associated with all of you?

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:17.608
You're buffoons.

00:07:17.642 --> 00:07:20.748
Bu-Buffoons, are we?

00:07:20.782 --> 00:07:22.484
We're the Top Executives!

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:24.823
Nobody is cooler than us!

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:27.060
Your mouth still works,
if nothing else.

00:07:27.094 --> 00:07:30.534
You're half dead already.
What do you know?

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:32.471
Executives like me
run the Family,

00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:34.909
and the Family runs Dressrosa!

00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:39.819
And now, we're running it into
the ground, just like you!

00:07:39.852 --> 00:07:42.190
Stick-Stickem...

00:07:43.126 --> 00:07:46.298
...Launcher!

00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:52.779
[TREBOL yelling]

00:07:52.812 --> 00:07:53.981
You cheater!

00:07:54.014 --> 00:07:55.885
Why don't you fight with
somebody who can fight back?!

00:07:55.918 --> 00:07:59.024
Law! You bastard!

00:07:59.057 --> 00:07:59.993
[LUFFY gasps]

00:08:00.026 --> 00:08:03.366
Okay, you brat.
You'd better listen up!

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:05.704
Step aside, Doffy!

00:08:05.738 --> 00:08:08.309
I'm gonna teach you
a lesson, Law.

00:08:08.342 --> 00:08:10.013
Doffy is King.

00:08:10.046 --> 00:08:14.054
His will is absolute
and we all respect that.

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:17.762
However, there's no hierarchy

00:08:17.795 --> 00:08:20.133
between him and the
four Top Executives.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:23.574
We're equals, okay?
Y'know why that is?

00:08:23.607 --> 00:08:27.047
'Cause one day,
30-something years ago,

00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:29.886
a gift fell from Heaven
and the four of us were

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:33.761
smart enough to see it for
what it was and nurture it!

00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:35.731
We gave him the
power he deserved

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.203
and turned him into
what he is today.

00:08:38.236 --> 00:08:40.874
A true champion of evil!

on your own, little guy?
That's powerful Haki! Wow!

And it's the Supreme
King's color, too!

00:08:57.006 --> 00:08:59.680
You were chosen
by Heaven itself.

00:08:59.713 --> 00:09:02.217
Your Haki is the proof!

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:06.258
[TREBOL] Do you want me
to give you the strength

00:09:06.291 --> 00:09:08.864
to take revenge?

[DOFLAMINGO]
Father.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.009
I'm going to take your head
back to the Holyland!

00:09:18.917 --> 00:09:21.856
You said they tried to kill you
when you went to Mariejois?

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.229
But you brought your
father's head. What's the deal?

00:09:29.606 --> 00:09:32.611
Anyway, we're all happy
you made it back here alive!

00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:35.951
It's a miracle.
You belong with us!

00:09:37.087 --> 00:09:38.456
Huh?

00:09:38.489 --> 00:09:40.193
Doffy.

00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:46.806
Doffy, your power proves

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.679
you have the quality
of a conqueror.

Doffy, we support you
in everything that you do.

00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:03.306
is that you show us
your wildest dreams!

[TREBOL]
Huh? Is something wrong, Doffy?

What is that bruise
on your forehead?

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.407
Some street thug did it.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.179

Huh? What do you want?

00:10:55.477 --> 00:10:57.113
Just one little question.

00:10:57.147 --> 00:11:00.453
You're the guy who roughed up
Doffy earlier, aren't you?

00:11:00.486 --> 00:11:05.931
Oh, that little brat? I just
teased him a little! [laughs]

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:09.070
[THUGS gasp]

00:11:09.104 --> 00:11:12.243
He was just having some fun.
Let's calm down, man!

Who are you bastards

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:20.995
So glad you asked.

We're the Don Quixote Family.

C'mon. Please don't
do it! Don't kill me!

00:11:30.814 --> 00:11:35.289

I'm gonna need you fellas

Did some jackass hurt you again?

[DOFLAMINGO] No, I just tripped
on a crack in the road.

How awful,
where exactly is this town?

Oh, I see. Yep.

[TOWNSMAN C gasps] Doflamingo

00:13:12.317 --> 00:13:15.123
[TREBOL]
Listen, Doffy. You're a king.

00:13:15.156 --> 00:13:18.328
That means no one is
allowed to defy your will.

00:13:18.362 --> 00:13:21.602
And if they do,
we'll stomp 'em out.

00:13:23.372 --> 00:13:26.211
[TREBOL] You may not feel
like a king just yet.

00:13:26.245 --> 00:13:32.390
But one day, I swear, you'll be
the ruler of all the seas.

00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:45.383
We always had faith
in Doffy as our king.

00:13:45.417 --> 00:13:48.456
And we instilled that faith
in his underlings, too.

00:13:48.489 --> 00:13:51.796
And now, that vision
has become a reality,

00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:54.234
because we saw Doffy
for what he truly was

00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:56.840
and upheld our devotion
to his cause!

00:13:56.873 --> 00:13:59.445
Just like a real family.

00:13:59.478 --> 00:14:03.486
And that's how Doffy
treats us in return.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.592
[laughs] Nothing else to say?

00:14:06.626 --> 00:14:10.934
Or maybe you remembered
that my mucus is flammable.

00:14:10.968 --> 00:14:12.337
I can shut you up for good

[LAW]
Only an idiot like you would

00:14:21.623 --> 00:14:24.228

but you only matter
so long as you serve it.

00:14:29.672 --> 00:14:31.876
And you are not equals, either.

00:14:31.909 --> 00:14:35.049
All of you are
disposable to him.

Wha?! What did you
just say to me?

Take a good look at yourself.

00:14:40.561 --> 00:14:42.030
It's all just a lie.

You act like you're
some "chief of staff,"

00:14:44.602 --> 00:14:46.271
but I can see the truth.

00:14:46.305 --> 00:14:49.445
You're a clown.

00:14:49.478 --> 00:14:55.657
[gasps] A clown and
a puppet, you say?!

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.394
Unforgiveable!

00:14:57.427 --> 00:14:59.798
[DOFLAMINGO] Stop!
You're falling into a trap!

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.201
[LAW]
Room!

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.374
You're inside his Room!

00:15:04.408 --> 00:15:06.513
[TREBOL] He was barely
alive in the first place

00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:09.986
and now he's covered from
head to toe in my mucus.

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:12.792
What the hell is he gonna do?

00:15:12.825 --> 00:15:14.929
I won't blow you up after all.

00:15:14.962 --> 00:15:17.200
'Cause that's not
nearly painful enough.

00:15:17.234 --> 00:15:20.841
I want your end to be
as gruesome as possible!

00:15:20.874 --> 00:15:23.847
C'mon! Open your mouth already!

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.918
Let him go!

00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:29.023
Or do I need to do it for you?

00:15:30.994 --> 00:15:33.065
I'm shoving this
down your throat!

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:36.238
Time for you to
say goodbye, Law!

00:15:52.604 --> 00:15:54.475
I won't blow you up after all.

00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:56.979
'Cause that's not
nearly painful enough.

00:15:57.013 --> 00:16:00.654
I want your end to be
as gruesome as possible!

00:16:00.687 --> 00:16:03.660
C'mon! Open your mouth already!

00:16:03.693 --> 00:16:05.731
Let him go!

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:08.503
Or do I need to do it for you?

00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:13.045
I'm shoving this
down your throat!

00:16:13.078 --> 00:16:16.185
Time for you to
say goodbye, Law!

00:16:16.218 --> 00:16:17.688
Stop it!

00:16:18.857 --> 00:16:22.230
Don't forget.
I'm a captain, too.

00:16:22.264 --> 00:16:27.073
If I leave you and Doflamingo
for Straw Hat to defeat alone,

00:16:27.106 --> 00:16:29.512
I'd be abandoning my pride.

00:16:29.545 --> 00:16:31.983
You're stuck on the ground
like a miserable worm.

00:16:32.016 --> 00:16:33.385
What pride do you have left?

00:16:33.418 --> 00:16:37.694
I'm so sick of you! Just die!

00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:41.468
[LAW]
Takt!

00:16:42.805 --> 00:16:44.207
[TREBOL]
What the?

00:16:46.445 --> 00:16:48.448
No!

00:16:50.486 --> 00:16:52.925
Sterben Blade!

00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.429
Pigya!

00:16:57.333 --> 00:17:01.242
Pigya!

00:17:01.275 --> 00:17:05.550
Pigya!

00:17:06.953 --> 00:17:08.590
[LEO gasps]

00:17:08.623 --> 00:17:11.362
Is something wrong? Leo?

00:17:11.395 --> 00:17:12.463
[gasps]

00:17:16.706 --> 00:17:18.176
[DWARVES gasp]

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:19.745
What's up, little bros?

00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:23.085
You started looking towards
the palace all of a sudden.

00:17:24.555 --> 00:17:28.663
I... I don't quite
understand why,

00:17:28.696 --> 00:17:30.032
but it feels like a giant weight

00:17:30.066 --> 00:17:32.704
has just been
lifted off my chest.

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:40.954
Huh? Save it. No time for
fuzzy feelings now.

00:17:40.987 --> 00:17:42.724
[DWARVES]
Huh?

00:17:42.758 --> 00:17:45.062
[FRANKY] I know we just
destroyed the factory,

00:17:45.096 --> 00:17:48.468
but we gotta haul ass,
or we'll get wrecked.

00:17:53.278 --> 00:17:55.784
We're all counting
on you, Luffy.

00:18:00.827 --> 00:18:02.765
[LUFFY]
What happened? Huh?

00:18:02.798 --> 00:18:06.539
Blood! Did this come
from that icky guy? [gasps]

00:18:06.572 --> 00:18:13.352
[TREBOL panting]

00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:22.638
[panting]

00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:37.868
[gasps] That's kinda weird!

00:18:37.901 --> 00:18:39.271
So, under all that
goop and stuff,

00:18:39.304 --> 00:18:41.742
he was actually super skinny?

00:18:45.551 --> 00:18:47.822
That's why my punch
couldn't hit him?

00:18:47.855 --> 00:18:50.325
Not some secret ability?

00:18:56.204 --> 00:19:02.651
[TREBOL groaning]

00:19:15.076 --> 00:19:20.854
[panting]

00:19:20.888 --> 00:19:27.667
[TREBOL panting]
Damn you, Law.

00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:34.280
[panting]

00:19:35.651 --> 00:19:37.788
I tried to warn you!

00:19:40.326 --> 00:19:45.136
What the hell kind of
plan was that? [groans]

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:48.075
Shooting your arm at me?

00:19:48.109 --> 00:19:50.947
You little cheater.

00:19:58.029 --> 00:20:00.466
You wanna play like that?

00:20:10.086 --> 00:20:15.564
Law. You can die with me!

00:20:15.597 --> 00:20:17.133
[LAW gasps]

00:20:17.166 --> 00:20:19.471
You've lost it!
Put away the fire!

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:22.978
See you in hell, Law!

00:20:36.806 --> 00:20:40.146
[LEO] The whole palace
just burst into flames!

00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:41.650
What happened up there?

00:20:41.683 --> 00:20:44.688
[USOPP gasps]
This is not what we need!

00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:48.395
Luffy.

00:20:48.428 --> 00:20:51.735
Hey, Viola! What's up? Tell us!

00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:06.298
[VIOLET] Trebol, the last
Top Executive, was defeated!

00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:08.268
[USOPP]
How's Luffy?

00:21:10.941 --> 00:21:15.049
[VIOLET gasps] I see
Doflamingo! And Straw Hat!

00:21:15.082 --> 00:21:17.119
Not dead! Okay!

00:21:17.153 --> 00:21:19.090
[VIOLET]
Yes. Now all that's left

00:21:19.123 --> 00:21:21.729
is for them to
defeat Doflamingo.

00:21:23.431 --> 00:21:26.004
I see them! They're coming here!

00:21:27.875 --> 00:21:29.044
Luffyland!

00:21:29.077 --> 00:21:30.514
Do you think he'll be okay?

00:21:30.547 --> 00:21:32.852
We have to back him up
somehow, Cub!

00:21:32.885 --> 00:21:33.653
Yeah!

00:21:33.687 --> 00:21:35.289
[ROBIN]
We probably shouldn't.

00:21:35.322 --> 00:21:37.795
In fact, we'd likely
just get in his way.

00:21:37.828 --> 00:21:38.963
Look close.

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:43.005
That man with Luffy is
a Warlord, like Doflamingo.

00:21:43.038 --> 00:21:44.675
That's Trafalgar Law.

00:21:44.708 --> 00:21:45.711
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:45.744 --> 00:21:47.914
[ROBIN]
And he's in pretty bad shape!

00:21:47.948 --> 00:21:49.217
[LEO]
Lawland!

00:21:49.251 --> 00:21:53.660
Luffy! Down here!
Let me take Traffy!

00:21:53.693 --> 00:21:55.530
[LUFFY]
Robin! Good idea!

00:21:55.564 --> 00:22:00.172
He's hurt, but Traffy
held his own against Mingo!

00:22:00.205 --> 00:22:02.243
[ROBIN]
Oh no! His arm!

00:22:02.276 --> 00:22:04.281
I've got you!

00:22:04.314 --> 00:22:06.719
Cien Fleurs: Spider Net!

00:22:22.016 --> 00:22:24.221
What happened to Lawland's arm?

00:22:24.254 --> 00:22:25.924
We'll get through this.

00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:28.229
Don't worry. I've got you.

00:22:28.262 --> 00:22:29.899
Nico Robin!

00:22:29.932 --> 00:22:30.834
[ROBIN gasps]

00:22:30.867 --> 00:22:33.405
I don't want you
butting in on our fight!

00:22:33.439 --> 00:22:35.944
The man's still
breathing, isn't he?

00:22:36.979 --> 00:22:39.719
Then I'm not done with him!

00:22:39.752 --> 00:22:40.887
Doflamingo!

00:22:40.921 --> 00:22:43.291
[LUFFY] Leave Traffy alone!
This is our fight now!

00:22:43.325 --> 00:22:44.695
This'll finish you!

00:22:44.728 --> 00:22:45.363
[gasps]

00:22:45.396 --> 00:22:47.634
All right, Gum-Gum...

00:22:49.203 --> 00:22:50.874
Bullet String!

00:22:50.907 --> 00:22:52.476
...Hawk Whip!

00:22:53.211 --> 00:22:55.382
[gasps] Damn it!

00:22:58.055 --> 00:22:59.926
You have to flee!

00:22:59.959 --> 00:23:02.296
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:23:02.329 --> 00:23:05.603
Robin! Run away!

00:23:14.522 --> 00:23:15.824
[NARRATOR]
Carrying on in Law's place,

00:23:15.857 --> 00:23:18.629
Luffy begins the final
showdown with Doflamingo.

00:23:18.663 --> 00:23:21.268
Red Hawk blazing,
he faces the wicked king's

00:23:21.301 --> 00:23:22.905
terrifying techniques head-on.

00:23:22.938 --> 00:23:24.942
Meanwhile, the citizens
of Dressrosa flee

00:23:24.975 --> 00:23:26.946
from the tightening
threads of the Birdcage,

00:23:26.979 --> 00:23:30.252
in what they fear may be
their kingdom's final day.

00:23:30.286 --> 00:23:31.822
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.070
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
