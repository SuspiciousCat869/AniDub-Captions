00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.757
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.693
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:38.925
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.828
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:47.066
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.235
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.603
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.872
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:54.774
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.177
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.879
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.551
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.119
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:09.822
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:13.960
I'm gonna be the
King... of the Pirates!

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.365
[NARRATOR] As Luffy and his
crew push on to the New World,

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.301
they make a stop
on Fishman Island,

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:24.938
where they are pulled into
a civil war years in the making.

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:26.306
After meeting with Jimbei,

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:28.775
they learn the history
of the island and the events

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:31.477
that led to their battle
with the New Fishman Pirates.

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:35.348
They also learn of Queen Otohime
who, despite opposition, fought

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:40.119
tirelessly for understanding
between humans and Fishmen.

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:42.956
[JIMBEI] If I join, Aladdin
and the other crew members

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.025
who do not wish to be pirates
no longer have to be.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.962
They can live in this country
without fear of retribution.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.431
It's a way for me
to take care of my men.

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:54.267
In case you forgot,
Tiger is dead!

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.036
I'd love to stay and chat,
but we're headed out, too.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.539
[JIMBEI] The Sun Pirates
split into three groups,

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:03.109
with Arlong, Macro,
and myself as captains.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.744
And ever since then,

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:07.947
we have continued
going our separate ways.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:17.023
[LUFFY] "Shaking Fishman Island!
A Celestial Dragon Drifts In!"

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:22.061
[SUN PIRATES cheering]

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:26.199
I can't believe we're home!

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:28.034
It's amazing, all right.

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:30.003
Never thought I'd
live to see this day.

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.738
You think back to how
much we suffered

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.573
at the hands of
the Celestial Dragons

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.174
and it's no surprise
we'd given up

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:37.377
on ever seeing
Fishman Island again.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.245
And if it wasn't for Boss Tai,

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.748
we'd all still be
slaves on Marie Jois,

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.983
and the Nobles would
still wanna control us.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.885
Bein' a pirate
all these years...

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:47.887
...well, it was
the only way to live.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.189
[SUN PIRATE E] But here we are!
Goin' home to be with

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:52.692
our families and we
don't even have to hide!

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:55.228
[SUN PIRATE F] It's happened!
We're finally free!

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:56.896
[SUN PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:00.233
Hey, Captain! Scratch that,
I mean, Brother Jimbei!

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:02.368
I'll never forget what
you've done for all of us!

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.337
Don't get so dramatic on me.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.473
'Course not, but we still want
you to know that we understand.

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:10.143
The only way pirates like
us could truly be free

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:12.011
is with the amnesty
of the government.

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.647
Yeah, and that's why you
joined the Warlords, isn't it?

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.717
We know that ya did it for us,
and not because ya wanted to.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.385
All right, that's
enough already.

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.089
If you want to get sentimental,
then save it for your families.

00:05:23.122 --> 00:05:25.992
Look, they're anxious
enough to see you as it is.

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:27.060
Oh, honey.

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:28.561
That's Dad?

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:29.362
My love...

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:31.197
Don't worry, go on.

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:32.932
[SUN PIRATE A laughs]

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.167
[FISHBOY A]
Dad!

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.968
[FISHWOMAN A]
You're home!

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:40.273
[CROWD chattering]

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:43.943
Aladdin, after all those
years you toiled as a slave,

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.279
how does it feel
to be a free Fishman?

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:47.980
Jimbei.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.682
As you say, we are free.

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:53.052
No longer hunted by the
Celestial Dragons, at least.

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:56.656
And at long last we can return
to our families without fear.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.758
But just like the mark
of the Celestial Dragons,

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:02.128
the agony that we suffered as
slaves is seared into our minds.

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:04.430
And though we may walk
this world as we please,

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:06.866
our hatred towards humans...

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.302
...it will always
bind our souls.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:13.673
[ALADDIN]
To be clear--

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:17.110
I understand every word of what
Brother Tai tried to impart.

00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:19.712
But, still...

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.484
[SUN PIRATE C]
This makes me sick.

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:26.819
How can Jimbei
join up with humans?

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:28.921
He's just a tool
for the World Government!

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:30.757
After everything that
happened with them, too.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.959
Did he already forget
who killed Fisher Tiger?

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:34.026
[SUN PIRATE C]
Hate to say it,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.062
but I've lost all
respect for him.

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:41.167
[JIMBEI] I knew quite well
what was waiting for me.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.403
The islanders
couldn't understand,

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:45.905
and they reviled the fact
that I joined the Warlords.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.886
[OTOHIME] I can't imagine
a more fortuitous situation.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.154
We now have a relationship

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:03.723
with the World Government
thanks to Jimbei.

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:05.158
This is our chance.

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:07.960
We can establish friendly
relations with humans now.

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:10.630
And I will work hard
to make sure that we do.

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:11.764
[NEPTUNE]
Of course,

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:14.267
but while I recognize
why Jimbei did it,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.970
it troubles me to see him take
on such a terrible burden.

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:20.540
If he receives an order
from the World Government,

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:21.908
he'll have no
choice but to fight

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.811
for their cause, regardless
of the circumstance

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:27.947
and no matter how much
he might disagree.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.382
He will be asked to stand in

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:32.718
harm's way and his
blood will be spilled.

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:33.953
[OTOHIME]
Yes.

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:37.457
He's making a great sacrifice,
and I won't let it go to waste.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.725
I promise that
I'll do my very best!

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.794
[NEPTUNE]
As long as you also promise me

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:43.996
that you won't push
yourself too hard.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.201
I would loathe to see you suffer
another debilitating hangover.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:49.068
Oh.

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:52.271
[NEPTUNE, OTOHIME laughing]

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:55.107
[JIMBEI] Despite this
promising turn of events,

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.676
something unexpected occurred

00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:00.613
that would forever alter the
path of Queen Otohime's life.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:04.484
An uninvited visitor
arrived on the island.

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:06.752
[BORDER GUARD A]
Ryugu Kingdom! Come in!

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:08.454
This is the border patrol!

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.223
A large, badly damaged ship

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:13.426
is seeking emergency
entry into the country!

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:14.794
Well, what are you waiting for?

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.295
Just do your job
and let them in!

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.797
[BORDER GUARD A]
It's a little complicated, sir!

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.931
[grunts]

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:24.370
[BORDER GUARD A] It belongs
to a... a Celestial Dragon!

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.439
It what?

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:28.374
King Neptune!

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:30.409
[NEPTUNE]
Wait, are you sure?

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:31.911
Grant them entry!

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:33.613
Send a rescue team right away!

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:34.280
[AMMO KNIGHTS]
Right!

00:08:34.313 --> 00:08:36.582
I'll go welcome them myself!

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:38.518
Queen Otohime!

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:41.087
[NEPTUNE] What in the
world is a Celestial Dragon

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.589
doing on the seafloor?

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:45.591
[FISHMAN AA] I can't
believe this is happening.

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.359
[FISHMAN BB]
Must've been attacked

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:47.927
by a Sea King or something.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.295
[FISHMAN CC]
Here's what I don't get,

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:51.230
they hate us Fishmen, right?

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:54.600
So what were they doing sailing
through such deep water?

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:55.401
[CROWD screams]

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:57.770
[MYOSGARD]
Fetch help, you idiots!

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:03.676
[MYOSGARD] My whole worthless
crew just had to go and die!

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.679
Bring me a mask,
you vulgar fishes!

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:11.918
I can't tolerate
your Fishman stench!

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:16.956
I demand that you
bring me a mask!

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:18.991
I need you to save my life!

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:21.160
Filthy fools!

00:09:21.193 --> 00:09:23.396
This creep's got
zero respect for us.

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:25.898
He thinks we're gonna help
him talking to us like that?

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.199
[gunshots]

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.801
[CROWD screams]

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:29.936
Doctor, now!

00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:31.971
[panting]

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:32.939
I need help!

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:34.006
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Are the medics here?

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.207
Well, yeah, they're here,

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.277
but they're not sure if
they wanna help that thing.

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.479
[HORDY]
Put him out of his misery.

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:45.284
He doesn't deserve
to live. He's pure scum.

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:47.620
[DECKEN]
The Seven Warlords are a joke!

00:09:49.822 --> 00:09:52.058
I wouldn't sell my soul
to take a job working

00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:54.660
for the World Government even
if the bastards begged me!

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:58.064
Hell no, you've got way too
much integrity, Captain Decken!

00:09:58.097 --> 00:10:00.733
Everyone talks about Jimbei
like he's invincible,

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:03.035
but he's no match
for me as a pirate!

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:05.571
And that much
is true, I suspect!

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.039
[laughs]

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:09.275
--[gunshots]
--[CROWD screaming]

00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:12.178
Huh? Sounds like somethin's
goin' on at the harbor.

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:13.145
Hey.

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:15.648
[FISHMAN D]
It's a Celestial Dragon.

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:19.418
Oh, man. Looks a like a
World Noble's causing this.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.621
Well, that's interesting.

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:22.989
[DECKEN LACKEY B]
I guess his ship got wrecked

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:24.957
and now he's flipping
his lid or something.

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:28.194
[DECKEN laughs]
C'mon, let's go check it out.

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:30.896
This is guaranteed to
be good for a few laughs.

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:41.574
[MYOSGARD] The Fishman
slaves have been allowed

00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:43.175
to return to their island?

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:45.911
How can this be, Daddy dear?

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:48.347
It's bureaucracy, my son.

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:51.784
The Fishman pirate, Jimbei,
joined the Seven Warlords

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.586
and he brokered a deal.

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:55.287
B-But I don't understand.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.590
Jimbei was the captain
of the Sun Pirates,

00:10:57.623 --> 00:11:00.426
the lowly thugs who've
been hiding the slaves.

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:03.596
He negotiated to have
their evasion charges dropped

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:07.667
and obtained amnesty for the
slaves to return home, you see.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.369
But if that's the case, then
they aren't just any slaves,

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:13.339
some of them are probably
my slaves, right, Daddy dear?

00:11:13.372 --> 00:11:15.775
Oh, I'm certain of it, my son.

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:18.477

after disrespecting us.

I'll just have to hunt them
down and reclaim them, won't I?

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.919
It's only right,
considering how much money

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:29.388
I spent on collecting those
slaves in the first place.

Up on the surface, all you have
to do is cry and the Admirals

does he expect from us?

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:03.829
We shouldn't even be
letting him leave anyway!

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:06.131
He's a danger to
the whole island!

00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:10.636
[OTOHIME]
Wait a minute!

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:13.538
It's evident to me that
you have more to say.

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:16.508
So I'll travel to the world
above with you to hear you out.

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:17.609
[grunts]

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:18.677
She can't!

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.179
It's too dangerous!
Please don't go!

00:21:21.213 --> 00:21:22.447
Mother, no!

00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:24.283
[NEPTUNE]
You must reconsider!

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:26.752
I cannot allow you
to face such danger!

00:21:26.785 --> 00:21:29.288
If you truly wish to
negotiate with the Nobles,

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:31.623
allow me to go in your place!

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:33.058
I know you'd be safe.

00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:34.559
You're the king
and a great knight,

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:37.262
so the humans couldn't harm
you even if they wanted to.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.930
[NEPTUNE]
That's precisely why I should--

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:39.998
You can't.

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:42.134
There's no point in
sending a warrior like you.

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:42.868
[NEPTUNE]
Hmm?

00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:44.670
This is a matter of appearance.

00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:45.804
Our nation needs to see

00:21:45.837 --> 00:21:48.307
that even someone who
is as powerless as I,

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.643
can travel amongst the humans
and then safely return home.

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:52.778
That's the point.

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:55.881
Without fear and with a heart
that's full of trust,

00:21:55.914 --> 00:21:57.349
I'll go myself.

00:21:57.382 --> 00:21:59.484
That's the only way
that this can be done.

00:21:59.518 --> 00:22:00.519
[NEPTUNE grunts]

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:01.453
Be careful, Mother!

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:02.888
Don't go, Mother!

00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:04.222
Queen Otohime!

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:06.591
I don't get it.
Where is she going?

00:22:09.227 --> 00:22:10.696
[NEPTUNE]
My queen...

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:12.497
Trust in me.

00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:14.800
Have faith in the
woman you married--

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:16.802
and the humans.

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:21.139
[CROWD shouting]

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:25.610
You're just the queen of a
fish tank. You arrogant trash!

00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:33.318
Goodbye, Mother!

00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:36.621
I will miss you!

00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:41.693
It's troubling.

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:45.397
Believe me, I know how you
feel, but no one can stop her.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.900
All we can do is have faith
and hope for the best.

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:54.072
[CROWD] Your Majesty!
Please be careful up there!

00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:55.574
[MERMAID J]
Come home safe!

00:22:55.607 --> 00:22:58.677
[SHIRAHOSHI]
I love you, Mother!

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:03.715
[CROWD shouting]

00:23:13.258 --> 00:23:15.460
[NARRATOR] Otohime returns
from the world above

00:23:15.494 --> 00:23:17.796
with a ray of hope
for Fishman Island.

00:23:17.829 --> 00:23:20.932
The once impossible dream now
becomes the dream of her people,

00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:24.903
as one islander after another
pledges support to her cause.

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:27.539
But just when the path to the
future seems to have opened,

00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:29.441
a shot echoes through the plaza,

00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:32.244
changing the course
of history forever.

00:23:32.277 --> 00:23:33.945
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:37.616
"A Sudden Tragedy! A Gunshot
Shuts Down the Future!"

00:23:37.649 --> 00:23:39.985
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
