00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.715
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.622
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:45.865
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:48.437
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.677
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.581
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.614 --> 00:02:56.086
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:58.924
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.400
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:04.936
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.644
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:12.952
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:16.860
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.893 --> 00:03:18.597
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.901
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:23.741
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:26.479
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:29.118
In response, Doflamingo
trapped the kingdom inside

00:03:29.152 --> 00:03:31.690
a barrier and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:31.723 --> 00:03:33.994
Amidst the chaos, he also
put prices on the heads

00:03:34.028 --> 00:03:37.836
of Luffy and his allies, turning
the entire kingdom against them.

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:39.204
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:41.610
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:41.644 --> 00:03:43.614
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:46.653
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:51.696
[KUWEEN grunts]

00:03:58.744 --> 00:04:03.286

[MANSHERRY crying]

00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:26.967
Nice work, now let's party.

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:32.979
[DWARVES] It's a robot! A big,
strong robot came to save us!

00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:34.215
Thank you, sir!

00:04:34.248 --> 00:04:35.283
So cool!

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.486
[DWARF A, I]
Robots are awesome!

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.390
So, is everybody okay?

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:40.427
[BOMBA]
Yeah! We made it!

00:04:40.461 --> 00:04:42.832
We're breaking all
you guys outta here!

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:44.235
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:47.107
We'll be free? Finally!

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.276
[GROUP squeals]

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:51.917
[DWARVES cheer]

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:03.040
I'm so happy. Good for you!

00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:04.375
Thank you, Mister Robot!

00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:06.713
He has a name and
he's not a robot.

00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:10.387
He's a Big Person. The great
hero known as Fraland!

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.691
[CHAO]
A Big Person?

00:05:11.724 --> 00:05:14.428
Where's the princess?
Is she here, too?

00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:17.334
[DWARF H] Mouji is looking
for her right now, but, uh,

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:19.505
no luck yet.

00:05:21.242 --> 00:05:24.516
[MOUJI]
I can't find her.

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:26.385
Where did you go?!

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.492
I-I refuse to accept this!

00:05:29.526 --> 00:05:32.933
[MOUJI] Princess?! Princess!
Surely you're hiding somewhere!

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.136
Oh! Oho! Oh! Not here!

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.140
Not here either!

00:05:37.174 --> 00:05:39.378
Where could she be?

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.719
[MOUJI]
Fool me again will you?!

00:05:42.752 --> 00:05:44.021
[DWARVES scream]

00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:48.864
[MOUJI yelling]

00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:53.841
Fear not! Wherever you may be,
loyal Mouji is coming for you!

Wait, Mouji!

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.382
Princess!

00:05:58.416 --> 00:06:01.122
Where have they
hidden you?! Where?!

00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:03.861
Here? Here?! No!

00:06:03.894 --> 00:06:06.766
No! Princess!

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:11.543
[MOUJI]
Princess!

Princess!

00:06:19.325 --> 00:06:21.162
Could... you... stop please?

00:06:21.195 --> 00:06:23.266
Wait for me!

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.337
[yells, gasps]

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.642
[GROUP groans]

00:06:29.077 --> 00:06:30.147
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Thought I heard something

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.852
strange over here.

00:06:32.885 --> 00:06:35.658
[MICE squeak]

00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:37.928
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Oh, just mice.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.001
[GROUP sighs]

00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:46.312
The search begins anew!

00:06:46.345 --> 00:06:47.516
[DWARF E, F]
Wait a sec!

00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:48.951
We've already looked
all over the place!

00:06:48.985 --> 00:06:52.324
I don't think Princess
Mansherry is here after all!

00:06:52.357 --> 00:06:55.931
[MOUJI]
What?! Then what shall we do?

00:06:55.964 --> 00:06:57.167
[KUWEEN grunts]

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.073
[FRANKY] What kind of person
is this princess of yours?

00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:01.943
[BOMBA]
Hm, where to start?

00:07:01.976 --> 00:07:02.812
[FRANKY]
Hm?

00:07:02.845 --> 00:07:04.115
Don't ignore me!

00:07:04.148 --> 00:07:08.690
We never settled things between
us, you bunch of little dolts!

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:11.229
So, is that her?

00:07:11.262 --> 00:07:13.165
[DWARVES]
No!

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.605
[KUWEEN]
The factory is my life!

00:07:15.638 --> 00:07:17.575
I'm the manager, you punks!

00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:21.115
When they call me to the scene,
you know you're in for it!

00:07:21.148 --> 00:07:22.652
[FRANKY grunts]

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:24.221
[DWARVES grunt, yelp]

00:07:24.254 --> 00:07:26.458
[FRANKY grunts]

00:07:28.096 --> 00:07:29.899
[gasps] You're Cyborg Franky

00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:32.037
from the Straw Hat
Pirates, aren't you?

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.207
I thought you only
had a one-star bounty.

00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:37.682
How did you make it this far
with a target on your head?

00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:40.020
Señor Pink should
have stopped you.

00:07:40.053 --> 00:07:42.559
Yeah? Y'think?

00:07:42.592 --> 00:07:44.696
[FRANKY] Earlier,
I saw this sweet old granny

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.467
having a tough time on
that street over there

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:49.271
and it darn near broke my heart.

00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:50.875
[SEÑOR] I just remembered,

00:07:50.908 --> 00:07:53.647
I've got some business
to take care of.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.222
That hard-boiled lifestyle
sure can be tough.

00:07:58.255 --> 00:08:00.360
Huh?! What're you talking about?

00:08:00.393 --> 00:08:02.699
[CAT A meows]

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:05.904
No Granny. Just cats.

00:08:05.938 --> 00:08:07.742
[KUWEEN]
Anyway, this is my factory--

00:08:07.775 --> 00:08:10.012
I won't let you have
the run of the place!

00:08:10.046 --> 00:08:12.685
You step up to
this lady, you die!

00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:15.123
Fraland! Be careful!
She's strong!

00:08:15.156 --> 00:08:17.127
[KUWEEN yells]

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.296

00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:19.999
[BOTH scream]

00:08:22.237 --> 00:08:26.546
[DWARVES] Fraland gave the
manager lady a great, big hug!

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:39.773
[KYROS]
We're completely surrounded.

00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:41.442
Were there always this many?

00:08:41.476 --> 00:08:42.946
This is a nuisance,

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:46.118
but it seems the only way to
advance is to dispose of them.

00:08:46.152 --> 00:08:47.856
All right!

00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:49.960
You wanna help me
kick their asses?

00:08:49.993 --> 00:08:52.798

Whoa! Nice one! Thanks, guys.

00:09:20.387 --> 00:09:22.457
Really! Pull it together!

00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:24.194
Get ready!

Where are they coming from?

00:09:30.273 --> 00:09:31.475
We don't have time to

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:32.645
keep wrestling with
these things all day!

00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:34.715
Then I'll crush
them all in one shot.

00:09:34.749 --> 00:09:35.651
[LUFFY]
No, me!

00:09:35.684 --> 00:09:36.686
[CAVENDISH]
I called it!

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.356

Hey, what's the big idea here?!

00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:49.411
You're being weird! Let go!

00:09:49.444 --> 00:09:52.250
[CHAO] Fraland just keeps
hugging her and hugging her!

00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:53.721
This is so romantic!

00:09:53.754 --> 00:09:55.824
Do you think it was
love at first sight?

00:09:55.858 --> 00:09:59.265
So that's your
type, huh, Fraland?

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:00.768
[SEÑOR]
Bastard fooled me.

00:10:00.802 --> 00:10:03.139
That dirty, lying cyborg.

00:10:03.172 --> 00:10:05.477
I was all worried
about that granny,

00:10:05.511 --> 00:10:08.149
but she isn't even real.

00:10:08.182 --> 00:10:10.654
Well, at least I don't
have to worry now.

for a workplace
environment, okay?!

00:10:39.244 --> 00:10:41.650
Y'know, that big baby
has been rattling my head

with suplexes one
after another, all day!

[FRANKY]
What's the deal?

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:48.096
Maybe he thought
my head was a jackhammer

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:51.570
and he was trying
to dig himself a hole?

lost it, haven't you?!

That hurt, you bastard!

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.916
Didn't your mama ever tell you
that's no way to treat a lady?!

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.921
You think you can
get away with that?!

00:11:33.954 --> 00:11:36.660
In my factory?!
I'm the manager here!

00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:38.462
That means nobody is above me!

I don't care how
nice your hugs are.

Once she gets this mad,
there's no stopping her!

Run away, Fraland!

Now, what should
I do to punish you?

I call the shots here after all!

factory,

whatever I say is the
law, understand me?!

00:11:53.794 --> 00:11:55.531
And I find you guilty!

00:11:55.565 --> 00:11:56.933
Sentenced to death!

00:11:56.967 --> 00:11:59.839
Disrespecting the manager's
a grave crime, you know!

00:11:59.872 --> 00:12:01.509
I'm gonna cut you
into tiny pieces,

00:12:01.542 --> 00:12:02.812
then suck them up
with my vacuum,

00:12:02.845 --> 00:12:04.448
then dump them out
and stomp on them,

00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:06.051
then suck them up
all over again!

00:12:06.084 --> 00:12:08.791

it'll do you any goo--

00:12:24.989 --> 00:12:29.866

My! How daring!

00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:48.369

from these sweet lips!

there and drown, or what?

Hold on! Franky!

00:12:55.216 --> 00:12:56.219
What was that?

00:12:56.252 --> 00:12:58.524
I didn't know you
felt that way about me!

00:12:58.557 --> 00:13:01.061
Everything's moving so fast!

00:13:01.094 --> 00:13:02.832
If that's how you
feel about a girl,

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:07.006
then you should ask
her out first! Dummy!

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.279
[DWARF H] I never knew she had
a girly side. This is a shock.

fault, Miss Manager.

That's how it goes.

00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:15.891
Huh?

00:13:15.924 --> 00:13:17.761
Love's got nothin'
to do with it.

00:13:17.795 --> 00:13:19.966
Even though he kissed me?

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:21.434
[SEÑOR]
That's right.

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:23.907
'Cause you cut in during a
sacred fight between two men.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.111
He had to seal
those lips somehow

00:13:26.144 --> 00:13:29.786
and a smooch is the
easiest way to do it.

ain't no thing, sister.

This is a battlefield,
not some day-care playground.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.641
Y'think I'm lookin' for
romance at a time like this?

00:13:40.674 --> 00:13:43.045
You said it.

I'm not gonna let you

even climb up this high?

find Princess Mansherry.

Yes, with my Clairvoyance,

00:18:08.275 --> 00:18:10.079
I can send my sight
wherever I want.

doesn't give us
a bunch of trouble.

a flattering picture.

Oh, your friend, huh?

00:18:57.508 --> 00:18:58.843
Indeed!

00:19:18.249 --> 00:19:19.418
When we came above,

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:21.857
we were surprised
at the state of things.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:22.958
A great number of people

00:19:22.992 --> 00:19:24.562
seemed to be rushing
to this plateau,

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:26.398
though I could not
discern the reason.

00:19:26.432 --> 00:19:28.369
[USOPP]
Yeah, that's a problem!

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:29.705
Though, honestly,

00:19:29.739 --> 00:19:31.609
I don't think they'll be
able to climb up this high.

00:19:31.642 --> 00:19:34.815
Worry not,
Long-Nosed Goblin Man.

00:19:34.848 --> 00:19:37.153
I saw that they were in need,

00:19:37.187 --> 00:19:39.190
so I provided them a net!

00:19:39.224 --> 00:19:40.126

arrive here shortly.

get me killed, you moron?!

coming here to get me!

00:19:54.955 --> 00:19:57.393
What an awful blunder I've made!

00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:59.799
My foolishness
is truly peerless.

00:19:59.832 --> 00:20:02.672
And I did such a thing
to my benefactor, no less.

00:20:02.705 --> 00:20:05.577
I shall commit hara-kiri
to show my regret.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.681
[KIN'EMON]

00:20:07.714 --> 00:20:08.884
Okay, I won't.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:12.991
Fix this! Or you might as
well cut open your belly!

00:20:23.178 --> 00:20:25.851
[VIOLET]
I don't see her anywhere.

00:20:25.884 --> 00:20:27.153
Unfortunately,

00:20:27.186 --> 00:20:30.393
when I was living in the palace
with the Don Quixote Family,

00:20:30.426 --> 00:20:32.029
I never heard
them mention anything

00:20:32.063 --> 00:20:34.568
about capturing
Princess Mansherry.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.941
[VIOLET]
I wonder if she's really here.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.673
[VIOLET] I'm sorry,
but I can't seem to find her.

00:20:53.706 --> 00:20:58.048
She must be well-hidden.
Search every nook and cranny.

00:20:58.082 --> 00:21:02.323
Doflamingo wouldn't be foolish
enough to kill Mansherry.

00:21:02.356 --> 00:21:05.730
Her ability is far too
valuable for him to lose.

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:11.842
Frankly, we could use that
ability ourselves at the moment.

00:21:12.978 --> 00:21:16.819
[VIOLET] Princess
Mansherry, where are you?

00:21:19.057 --> 00:21:22.496
[VIOLET] There must be
someplace I haven't looked yet.

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:25.838
A place I haven't seen
in the past few years.

00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:28.543
I've lived in this
palace my entire life.

00:21:28.577 --> 00:21:32.049
I explored every inch
of it when I was young.

00:21:33.687 --> 00:21:36.992
[VIOLET] I snuck into places
no one else would enter.

00:21:37.026 --> 00:21:41.234
I caused some mischief
and got punished for it.

That's it!

00:21:48.248 --> 00:21:50.787
There's still one room
I haven't checked!

00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:08.088
[VIOLET]
Behind the chapel.

00:22:08.122 --> 00:22:10.425
It was hidden away.

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:18.509
[MANSHERRY crying]

00:22:31.602 --> 00:22:34.207
Take it. Time to eat.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.450
[MANSHERRY crying]

00:22:49.605 --> 00:22:53.479
[MANSHERRY] I just want
to go back to Green Bit.

00:22:53.513 --> 00:22:57.687
Won't anybody come save me?

00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:04.968
Leo!

00:23:06.639 --> 00:23:09.043
[VIOLET]
I found you, princess!

00:23:14.655 --> 00:23:16.191
[NARRATOR] With the
aid of her Clairvoyance,

00:23:16.224 --> 00:23:19.030
Violet finally discovers
Princess Mansherry's location,

00:23:19.063 --> 00:23:21.434
giving hope to Leo
and the other Tontattas.

00:23:21.467 --> 00:23:23.105
However, Luffy is still held up

00:23:23.138 --> 00:23:24.742
by the gruesome
Headcracker Dolls,

00:23:24.775 --> 00:23:27.380
while the battle between the
Executives and Luffy's allies

00:23:27.413 --> 00:23:29.551
from the coliseum rages on.

00:23:29.585 --> 00:23:31.154
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.188 --> 00:23:35.396
"Invincible! A Gruesome
Army of Headcracker Dolls!"

00:23:35.429 --> 00:23:38.101
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
