00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,700
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:41,336
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,706
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:47,375
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:49,511
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body

42
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,946
turned to rubber after
eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,983
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:57,752
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,785 --> 00:02:59,420
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:01,489
of the World Government,
which will use

47
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:03,825
any means necessary
to stop them.

48
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:07,795
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

49
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:11,065
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

50
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,102
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

51
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:18,773
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

52
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:23,411
[NARRATOR] In search of
a ship-coating craftsman

53
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:26,114
to help them reach Fishman
Island, the Straw Hat crew

54
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:29,584
landed on the
Sabaody Archipelago.

55
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:31,786
This mission led them
to Rayleigh, a craftsman

56
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:36,157
and former vice-captain
of the Roger Pirates.

57
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,159
The Straw Hat crew
tried to lay low

58
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:40,028
while Rayleigh
modified the Sunny,

59
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:42,497
but they were ambushed
by a cyborg that bore

60
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,700
a suspicious resemblance
to Bartholomew Kuma.

61
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,635
[SANJI]
Diable Jambe!

62
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,704

Third gear!

00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:04,819
Here goes!

68
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:08,489
Giant rifle!

[panting]

70
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:24,038
[LUFFY sighs]
We need to get some rest.

71
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:27,575
I was up for a fight, but that
guy was way too much for me.

72
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:28,810
I'm exhausted.

73
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:32,847
[NARRATOR] Overwhelmed and
tired, they attempted to escape,

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,917
only to be ambushed by
Sentomaru of the Marines

75
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,052
and another Pacifista.

76
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:41,823
[ALL scream]

77
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:44,492
[LUFFY pants]
We can't win.

78
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:48,563
Let's run, but not all together.
We need to split up!

79
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:49,897
[SENTOMARU]
They're splitting into groups!

80
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,466
Go after them, PX-1!

81
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,968
Now Gum-Gum...

[USOPP] Who-who are
you? Or what are you?

89
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:14,489
Whatever! Just get the
hell away from Zoro!

90

[BROOK]
Oh, no, no, Zoro!

91
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:19,627
He got hit by one of
those laser beams!

92
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:20,828
Kizaru?

you'd realize how
screwed you are.

Ya think ya could take down

Alright, Trafalgar.
You gonna explain now?

It's a Logia, you see.

00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,951
[ZORO grunts]

180
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,858
He just shifted in place!

181
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:34,992
Unbelievable.

182
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:36,460
[ROBIN grunts]

183
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,532
It's cute how your
friends want to save you.

184
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:44,435
But you're far beyond help now.

185
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:48,773
[KIZARU]
Well then...

186
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:51,442
Time to die.

187
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,100
[ZORO groans]

188
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,004
You picked some time
to come out of hiding.

189
00:11:21,572 --> 00:11:23,808
[KIZARU]
You sure you want to do this,

190
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:25,509
Dark King Rayleigh?

191
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:28,279
Don't go picking these
buds before they sprout.

192
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,815
Their era is only
just beginning.

193
00:11:30,848 --> 00:11:33,250
And I wanna see
what they do with it.

194
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:37,021
Rayleigh!

195
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:39,423
The geezer saved Zoro.

196
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:40,891
[NAMI sighs]

197
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:43,828
[SANJI panting]

198
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:45,963
I was so scared!

199
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,498
[ROBIN sighs]

200
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:51,102
[SENTOMARU] So that guy is
the Dark King? Interesting.

201
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:52,937
[KIZARU] I'd heard rumors
you were somewhere

202
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,373
on the archipelago but I chalked
them up as ghost stories.

203
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:58,008
Yet here you are,

204
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:01,011
sticking your neck out
for these rookies.

205
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:04,348
You just can't shake those
instincts, can you, Rayleigh?

206
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:06,550
Once a pirate, always a pirate.

207
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:08,886
[RAYLEIGH] I'd be more than
happy to retire in peace

208
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:12,123
and live out the quiet life,
but it's a little tough to do

209
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:14,558
when the Navy keeps hanging
wanted posters of me.

210
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:17,361
[KIZARU] You were a member
of the Roger Pirates, Rayleigh.

211
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:20,197
Do you really think your
crimes can be forgotten?

212
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:22,133
But if we were to make
an honest attempt

213
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,969
at capturing you, that
would require some serious

214
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:27,471
preparation on our part.

215
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:30,307
[USOPP sighs]
Wow, I'm so relieved!

216
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:32,443
That old man has
really got some power.

217
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:34,211
All of our attacks
went through him

218
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:36,247
as if he were a ghost.

219
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,984
But, when Rayleigh
attacked, it hit.

220
00:12:40,017 --> 00:12:41,886
[RAYLEIGH] Why don't you
just look the other way

221
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,388
and let these kids go?
What's the harm?

222
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,957
C'mon, what reality
are you living in?

223
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:49,660
You know there's no way I
can just let them off the hook.

224
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:52,930
Not when we have to answer
to the Celestial Dragons.

225
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:56,267
Navy HQ's gotta keep them
happy and that won't do it.

226
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,003
I'd appreciate it if
you don't interfere.

227
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:01,906
Hey, Usopp! You guys!

228
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:02,773
[KIZARU]
Huh?

229
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:06,443
[LUFFY]
Grab Zoro and get outta there!

230
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:07,444
[USOPP]
Let's go, Brook!

231
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:08,979
[BROOK]
Right!

232
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:12,616
Everyone start running
and look after yourselves!

233
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,486
[LUFFY]
We can't win this one!

234
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,521
We're too weak!

235
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:19,356
Get moving!

236
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,460
He knows when he's beat.
Well, ain't that a pain.

237
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:24,929
[NAMI]
Franky, c'mon!

238
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:27,631
Not before I let loose
one final attack

239
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:30,234
with all of my cola energy!

240
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:34,004
Coup de Vent!

241
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:39,143
[FRANKY] How'd that feel,
ya mechanical ass?!

242
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:40,244
Now hurry, run!

243
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,545
[CHOPPER, ROBIN panting]

244
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:44,181
Hey, old man! Thanks a lot!

245
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:47,251
Sure thing! And best
of luck to you!

246
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,087
[KIZARU]
Sacred Yata Mirror.

247
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,491
[USOPP]
I can't see!

248
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:58,596
I don't think he's
trying to help us see!

249
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,232
[RAYLEIGH grunts]

250
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:03,701
You're stayin' put.

251
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:06,270
Feels good to hold
a blade again.

252
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,372
Ama no Murakumo.

253
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:10,174
Sword!

254
00:14:12,776 --> 00:14:16,113
This is disappointing.

255
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:20,551
I was expecting a laid back,
hassle free, island excursion.

256
00:14:20,584 --> 00:14:24,588
Life is nothing but a series
of surprises, Kizaru.

257
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:26,624
[BROOK] That light
from before. It's gone!

258
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,759
[USOPP] I guess the
old man saved us again!

259
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:32,162
[BROOK yelping]
I was so scared!

260
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:38,002
It appears he's the
Dark King after all.

261
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:41,205
I've never seen anyone put
Uncle through a fight like that.

262
00:14:41,238 --> 00:14:46,110
We were so close to closing the
book on Roronoa's days of crime.

263
00:14:46,143 --> 00:14:49,146
[SENTOMARU]
PX-1! Finish Roronoa off first!

264
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,981
He's barely alive!

265
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:03,294
Crap, this is bad. Hey, Franky!

266
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:05,496
Do me a favor and
keep Nami safe, okay?

267
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,697
Just keep on running!

268
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,533
[FRANKY] We'll be fine! You
take care of yourself, okay?

269
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:11,368
[NAMI]
What're you doing, Sanji?

270
00:15:11,402 --> 00:15:17,291
[SANJI]
I've gotta help Usopp and Zoro!

271
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:35,509
[USOPP panting]

272
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:37,511
[ZORO] Put me down.
[USOPP] Huh?

273
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,548
Just leave me. Save yourself.

274
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:43,083
Aw, don't be a moron!

275
00:15:43,117 --> 00:15:46,053
Right now, you're even more
weak and useless than I am!

276
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:47,588
We're getting out
of here together!

277
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:50,424
Those were Luffy's orders
and I'm stickin' to 'em!

278
00:15:53,794 --> 00:15:55,129
Huh? Wait, do I hear--

279
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:59,533
[BROOK, USOPP scream]

280
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:03,103
[USOPP, BROOK whimpering]

281
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:06,507
[BROOK]
C'mon, hurry up, Usopp!

282
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,977
You go on without me!
It's fine. I'll hold him back!

283
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,145
No, don't do it, Brook!

284
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,714
You dont' know how strong
he is, he'll rip you apart!

285
00:16:13,747 --> 00:16:16,784
[BROOK]
Never fear! Run on, my friend!

286
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:18,419
This is what must be done!

287
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:20,721
There comes a time
when a man must put

288
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:21,889
everything on the line!

289
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:23,757
[BROOK yells]

290
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:28,429
[BROOK groaning]

291
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:31,765
No bones about it,
that was pretty pointless.

292
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,001
Brook, no!

293
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,936
[USOPP screams]

294
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:40,541
[USOPP]
Go away, leave me alone!

295
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:43,744
[SANJI panting]
Get the hell away from them,

296
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:45,779
you stupid cyborg!

297
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:51,385
[SANJI]
Hyah!

298
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:54,021
Sanji!

299
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,590
[SANJI groans]
Ow, my leg!

300
00:16:56,623 --> 00:16:59,593
[SANJI grunting]

301
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:02,529
[USOPP] Move, Sanji!
He's gonna shoot you!

302
00:17:04,198 --> 00:17:06,734
Moron! Why aren't you running?

303
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:09,503
[USOPP screams]

304
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,007
[panting]

305
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,909
[RAYLEIGH]
Huh?

306
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,879
Even if you distract
me, my subordinates

307
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,982
are quite capable on their own.

308
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:23,951
[RAYLEIGH growls]

309
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:29,089
[SANJI grunts, panting]

310
00:17:29,123 --> 00:17:32,926
[USOPP panting, coughing]

311
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,064
I dropped you! I'm sorry,
Zoro! It was an accident!

312
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:48,842
Hey, jerk, who said
I was done with you?

313
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:54,581
[SANJI grunting]
Dammit! Stop and fight me!

314
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:01,555
Looks like they're
in trouble over there.

315
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:04,158
[SENTOMARU] You've got
plenty of trouble yourself.

316
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:06,927
But just to be fair,
I won't use my battleaxe

317
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,762
on you this time.

318
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,864
[SENTOMARU]
Ashigara Dokkoi Shove!

319
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:12,800
[LUFFY screams]

320
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:15,669
Luffy! Why?

321
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:18,872
How can his attacks work on him
when Luffy's made of rubber?

322
00:18:18,906 --> 00:18:19,573
What the hell?

323
00:18:19,606 --> 00:18:21,909
Chopper! We have to keep moving!

324
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:23,610
[USOPP]
Sanji!

325
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,579
[CHOPPER, ROBIN gasp]

326
00:18:28,882 --> 00:18:29,850
[CHOPPER, ROBIN gasp]

327
00:18:29,883 --> 00:18:32,519
Sanji!

328
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:34,388
[USOPP groans]

329
00:18:38,258 --> 00:18:44,698
[LUFFY groaning]

330
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:47,768
Everybody's gonna die!

331
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:49,770
[ROBIN]
No, Chopper! It's too dangerous!

332
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:52,940
Get the hell away
from my friends!

333
00:18:52,973 --> 00:18:55,108
Now rumble ball!

334
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:15,162
[CHOPPER roaring]

335
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,563
[BOTH gasp]

336
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:17,865
It's Chopper!

337
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:20,234
I like little Chopper better!

338
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:22,069
What exactly am I looking at?

339
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:25,873
[CHOPPER roaring]

340
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:29,610
It's even worse than
what the others told me.

341
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:35,315
[CHOPPER growling]

342
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:37,985
That's an interesting
power you've got there.

343
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:41,054
It's too bad you don't seem
to have any control over it.

344
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:43,290
[CHOPPER growling]

345
00:19:43,323 --> 00:19:45,726
[ROBIN]
Luffy! C'mon!

346
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:55,802
[CHOPPER growling]

347
00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:59,139
[USOPP pants]
This is what it's come to?

348
00:19:59,172 --> 00:20:01,642
Even if he beats him, then what?

349
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:05,112
[beeping]

350
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:08,649
[CHOPPER roars]

351
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:11,818
[USOPP] I don't know what's
going on, but he seems confused.

352
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:13,654
Now's our chance!

353
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:15,722
[USOPP]
Sanji, Brook...

354
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,391
Get up. Snap out of it!

355
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,661
Chopper bought us
some time! We gotta move!

356
00:20:20,694 --> 00:20:22,296
You wanna live, right?

357
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,234
[USOPP gasps]
Hey! You're blowin' our chance!

358
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,037
Brook! Sanji!

359
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,805
[USOPP whimpers]

360
00:20:33,173 --> 00:20:35,876
[KUMA]
Stand down, PX-1.

361
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,288
[BROOK gasps]

362
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:53,794
[USOPP, BROOK scream]

363
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:56,196
[USOPP]
Not another one!

364
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,668
This is officially too much.

365
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:03,236
I can't take it!

366
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:08,008
Just how many of these guys
are there? It isn't fair!

367
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:16,750
[ZORO grunting]

368
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:21,688
[ZORO]
It's him. It's the real Kuma.

369
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,130
[ZORO grunting]

370
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,833
[ZORO groaning]

371
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:38,372
[ZORO panting]

372
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:44,911
[SANJI] What in the
hell happened here?

373
00:21:44,945 --> 00:21:47,114
[ZORO grunts]

374
00:21:47,147 --> 00:21:51,251
What happened here?
Nothing at all.

375
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:56,256
[KUMA]
I see you survived, Roronoa.

376
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:58,191
Just barely.

377
00:21:58,225 --> 00:22:00,961
I've got your mercy
to thank for that.

378
00:22:00,994 --> 00:22:02,496
What're you doing, Zoro?

379
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:07,467
This is no time to talk
to the enemy. Let's go!

380
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:09,469
[KUMA]
If you could take a vacation,

381
00:22:09,503 --> 00:22:12,272
where is it you'd like to go?

382
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:15,776
Hey, Zoro. C'mon!

383
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,711
Let's get out of
here while we can!

384
00:22:22,783 --> 00:22:24,184
Huh?

385
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:33,527
Where did-- Hey, Zoro?

386
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,163
Is he gone?

387
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:38,765
[SANJI grunting]

388
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,536
[USOPP] Zoro! Oh man,
oh man, this is bad!

389
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,904
No.

390
00:22:43,937 --> 00:22:46,373
What happened? Where is he?

391
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,908
[ROBIN gasps]

392
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:51,344
Zoro...

393
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:05,325
Zoro... He just disappeared.

394
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:18,271
[LUFFY]
It's over. They're all gone.

395
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:28,281
Brook, Franky, Robin, Chopper,
Sanji, Usopp, Nami, Zoro...

396
00:23:28,315 --> 00:23:30,150
What's wrong with me?

397
00:23:30,183 --> 00:23:32,586
I couldn't save a single
one of my friends!

398
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,254
On the next One Piece.

399
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:38,024
"Eliminated Friends - The Final
Day of the Straw Hat Crew."
