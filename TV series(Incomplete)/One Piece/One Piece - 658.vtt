[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.422
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.363
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:43.106
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.578 --> 00:02:37.982
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:40.855
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:46.165
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:48.805
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.838 --> 00:02:51.977
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.915
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:56.319
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.352 --> 00:02:59.358
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.701
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:05.336
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.977
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:13.319
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:18.062
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:21.435
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.241
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:24.274 --> 00:03:27.280
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:29.620
Upon arrival, Luffy entered
a fighting tournament

00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:32.592
that promises the Flame Flame
Fruit to the champion.

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:35.531
Rebecca, a gladiator
that Luffy befriended,

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:38.136
is fighting an
increasingly desperate battle

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.075
in the final match
of the first round.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.053
[LUFFY]
"A Big Surprise!

I can't believe I
finally found you!

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:04.021
Mister Luffy!

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.564
Is it... really you?

00:04:08.598 --> 00:04:09.832
Of course!

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:13.106
And you're that fabulous fighter
from the match in Block B!

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:13.941
Bartolomeo?

00:04:13.974 --> 00:04:17.080
Uh-huh! But I can't believe it!

00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:21.624
You know my name!
I've never been so happy!

00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:23.528
Of course I know your name.

00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:26.901
I hope to see you again in
the finals. Keep fighting!

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:29.906
You're far too kind! Y'know,

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:33.881
the only reason I went out to
sea was to be just like you!

00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:36.887
[BARTOLOMEO sobs]

00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:38.389
Huh. Wait.

00:04:38.422 --> 00:04:40.160
Where do I watch
the match, again?

00:04:40.194 --> 00:04:41.195
It must be that way.

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.468
[gasps] Wait Mister Luffy!

00:04:44.503 --> 00:04:46.973
[LUFFY]
Hm? Hm...?

00:05:02.204 --> 00:05:03.674
Whoa, jeez...

00:05:03.707 --> 00:05:05.811
Are they gonna toss everyone
down here, or what?

00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:19.305
[grunts] It's Grandpa!

00:05:19.338 --> 00:05:22.979
And Sai, too! Oh! What smells?

00:05:23.012 --> 00:05:24.850
Hello there, Boo.

00:05:24.883 --> 00:05:27.454
[BOO coughs]
So...

00:05:27.487 --> 00:05:29.626
Is this some kinda trash heap?

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.031
Why are there toys everywhere?

00:05:32.064 --> 00:05:34.234
What is this place, Brother?

00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:36.606
How am I supposed to know?

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.846
Next one's comin' down.
Better not stand there.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.652
[BOO grunts, groans]

00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:47.529
[RICKY] To think there was
such a massive junkyard

00:05:47.562 --> 00:05:52.572
hidden beneath the kingdom.

00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:55.010
[TANK]
Excuse me. I have a question.

00:05:55.043 --> 00:05:56.312
[RICKY]
Hm?

00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:01.924
I could be wrong.
If so, forgive me.

00:06:01.957 --> 00:06:04.629
But you're him, aren't you?

00:06:04.662 --> 00:06:05.932
Tell me, please.

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:08.102
Sir, you must be!

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.652
[TANK] To think you've been
alive all this time, King Riku.

00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:16.853
[COMPETITORS gasp]

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:18.289
[COMPETITOR A]
King Riku...?

00:06:18.322 --> 00:06:20.393
There's no way!

[ALL grunting]

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:28.476
[TANK gasping]

00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:30.981
You crazy? The man's dead!

00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:33.654
Did you hit your head
when you fell down here?

00:06:33.687 --> 00:06:38.496
[laughs] That old king lost
his mind, didn't he?

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:41.904
Went on a rampage and had to
be put down like a wild dog,

00:06:41.937 --> 00:06:43.740
from what I heard.

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:58.971
[RICKY] We're far enough from
prying eyes, I suppose.

00:06:59.004 --> 00:06:59.973
[TANK gasps]

00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:02.812
[RICKY] I might as well
shed my disguise.

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.934
[ALL murmuring]

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:15.705
[TANK gasping]

00:07:15.738 --> 00:07:18.109
[RICKY] I couldn't hide
the truth from you.

00:07:18.142 --> 00:07:19.846
I am indeed Riku.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.186
Though there's no need to call
me "King" anymore, Captain Tank.

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:25.724
[TANK cries]

00:07:27.796 --> 00:07:31.001
[COMPETITOR K]
It's really him!

00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:33.674
[COMPETITOR L]
He's been alive this whole time!

00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:39.853
[TANK sobs] I'm so happy
to see you, King Riku.

00:07:39.886 --> 00:07:42.993
I can't even save
my own granddaughter.

00:07:43.026 --> 00:07:45.532
I'm just a sad old man now.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.903
Not worthy to be king.

00:07:47.936 --> 00:07:50.641
[TANK]
It's been so long.

00:07:52.278 --> 00:07:54.716
Forgive me, my lord.

00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:56.520
With Doflamingo in control, I--

00:07:56.554 --> 00:08:00.928
Enough! I trust you.

00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:04.434
I know you've been watching
over Viola all this time.

00:08:04.468 --> 00:08:06.439
I'm certain that you
would not abandon

00:08:06.472 --> 00:08:09.311
your duty or honor so easily.

00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:12.050
I can only imagine how
much you've suffered.

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:16.459
[TANK] No, it's nothing compared
to what you've gone through.

00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:17.529
[DAGAMA grunts]

00:08:17.562 --> 00:08:18.831
He's not kidding!

00:08:18.864 --> 00:08:21.035
It really is King Riku!

00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:23.674
Heh. Is that the
King of Prodence?

00:08:23.707 --> 00:08:27.280
[ELIZABELLO laughs]
None other, old friend!

00:08:27.313 --> 00:08:30.588
So many times in the past
you've aided my kingdom!

00:08:30.622 --> 00:08:32.525
Oh, I've missed you!

00:08:32.558 --> 00:08:33.861
Whoa there, okay!

00:08:33.894 --> 00:08:36.767
Things haven't been the same
at all since you've been away!

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.539
There's no stability between
nations these days.

00:08:39.573 --> 00:08:44.014
War all the time!
Oh! I've had enough!

00:08:44.048 --> 00:08:45.050
Huh?

00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:47.989
"Had enough"?
Why don't you wake up?

00:08:48.022 --> 00:08:50.260
While you're crying,
someone else is laughing

00:08:50.293 --> 00:08:53.266
all the way to the bank!
Ever think of that?

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:54.602
[RICKY growls]

00:08:55.604 --> 00:08:58.375
Our nations are being pushed
into war with each other.

00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:00.480
All to suit someone
else's agenda.

00:09:00.514 --> 00:09:02.652
It's a nice gig
for a weapons dealer.

00:09:02.686 --> 00:09:05.657
The more we fight,
the richer they get!

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.205
And in this case, the one to
blame is a man known as Joker.

00:09:13.239 --> 00:09:16.212
It's an alias of Doflamingo,
of course.

00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:18.950
As of yet, we haven't
determined where he

00:09:18.984 --> 00:09:21.790
manufactures or
stores his weapons.

00:09:21.824 --> 00:09:24.963
But we do know that he's
selling them to our enemies,

00:09:24.996 --> 00:09:28.570
locking our kingdom into a war
that never seems to end!

00:09:28.603 --> 00:09:29.706
[RICKY gasps]

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.041
[ELIZABELLO growls]

00:09:31.075 --> 00:09:34.014
We entered this tournament as
an excuse to infiltrate the city

00:09:34.047 --> 00:09:36.587
and search for
Doflamingo's factory.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.657
At the bequest of
the King of Kano,

00:09:38.691 --> 00:09:41.630
we of the Happosui Army
are working to stem the tide

00:09:41.663 --> 00:09:44.267
of weapons smuggling
that plagues this world!

00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:47.040
King Riku! Doflamingo's
ascension to the throne

00:09:47.074 --> 00:09:49.546
is the result of you
acting foolishly!

00:09:49.579 --> 00:09:52.552
And now all the nations
around you are suffering!

00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:53.486
[RICKY growls]

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.058
What he says is true,
King Elizabello.

00:09:56.092 --> 00:09:57.361
[ELIZABELLO grunts]

00:09:57.394 --> 00:09:59.465
[DAGAMA] It is noble of you
to show gratitude for the aid

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:03.807
Dressrosa offered us in the
past, but those days are gone.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.012
The name King Riku's been
dragged through the mud

00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:07.582
and rightfully so.

00:10:07.615 --> 00:10:09.051
Enough, Dagama!

00:10:09.085 --> 00:10:10.754
Huh?

00:10:10.788 --> 00:10:13.126
We faced a nightmare
ten years ago,

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:15.363
and the truth you know is a lie!

00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:18.069
So shut your mouth
about King Riku!

00:10:18.103 --> 00:10:20.874
It's over! Stop fighting!

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.312
Uh, King Riku.

00:10:23.346 --> 00:10:27.253
Many years ago, I was
a soldier in your army.

00:10:28.455 --> 00:10:29.826
I was as well.

00:10:29.859 --> 00:10:33.366
Me, too, my lord.
And proud of it.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:34.334
[RICKY]
Hm?

00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:39.478
[gasps] The hell...?

00:10:39.513 --> 00:10:41.983
[COMPETITOR F] What's happening?
This is creepy!

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:45.691
I thought they were broken,
but now they're getting up!

00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:09.238
Why would all those
soldiers bow to Riku?

00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:12.211
And the toys, too! What gives?

00:11:12.244 --> 00:11:13.714
They're loyal to him?

00:11:13.747 --> 00:11:15.050
I don't get it.

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:17.788
I thought everyone here
hated King Riku.

00:11:20.794 --> 00:11:21.863
[RICKY]
Hm?

00:11:21.896 --> 00:11:24.101
[HACK] Yeah. There's
a structure down here

00:11:24.134 --> 00:11:26.038
even King Riku
didn't know about.

00:11:26.072 --> 00:11:29.545
If you ask me, we should
start searching underground.

00:11:29.579 --> 00:11:30.681
[KOALA]
I see.

00:11:30.714 --> 00:11:32.585

Now go straight
through that door.

Keep walking,
you'll find a factory

00:13:09.177 --> 00:13:12.785
with a port along
the way. March!

[TREBOL] Those contenders
were all pretty tough.

What did you turn me into?!

00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:12.103
[GANCHO] Many ages ago,
our Tontatta ancestors

00:14:12.136 --> 00:14:15.476
took to the seas, not in
search of treasure,

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:19.552
but in search of resources
that their homeland lacked.

00:14:19.585 --> 00:14:21.723
But they could not hide
from the Big People,

00:14:21.757 --> 00:14:23.860
and their encounters
never ended well.

00:14:23.893 --> 00:14:28.469
Before long, our race was
in danger of going extinct.

When all seemed lost,
they came here to Dressrosa

00:14:39.992 --> 00:14:44.234
and met with the King.
He offered the Tontatta a deal.

00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:46.740
In exchange for a bit of labor,

00:14:46.773 --> 00:14:51.315
he would provide us with a home,
resources, and safety.

00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:53.219
And as for the king's name...

00:14:53.253 --> 00:14:55.056
It was Don Quixote.

[DWARVES murmuring]

00:15:03.405 --> 00:15:07.213
This fateful encounter occurred
more than 900 years ago,

00:15:07.247 --> 00:15:09.986
but it's remembered
as the beginning

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:13.092
of the darkest age
in our history.

00:15:13.126 --> 00:15:16.498
We call it The Slave Era!

00:15:16.533 --> 00:15:19.304
There are some surviving
manuscripts that detail

00:15:19.337 --> 00:15:23.212
the cruelty we faced at the
hands of the royal family.

00:15:23.245 --> 00:15:26.986
And they are horrifying!

00:15:28.355 --> 00:15:31.663
[GANCHO] Our ancestors toiled
and toiled underground,

00:15:31.696 --> 00:15:33.800
hidden away from the world.

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:37.908
Meanwhile, the Big People above
lived a life of luxury,

00:15:37.942 --> 00:15:40.213
built upon the backs
of our efforts,

00:15:40.246 --> 00:15:42.417
with the riches we discovered.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.588
[ALL crying]

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.036
[GANCHO] Now, the next hundred
years were part of the

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.111
Blank Century, so the records
from that time are lost to us.

00:15:56.144 --> 00:16:01.723
But 800 years ago, a new king
came to power in Dressrosa.

00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:03.994
[DWARVES]
King Riku the First!

00:16:04.027 --> 00:16:07.333
[DWARVES cheering]

00:16:21.929 --> 00:16:24.167
[GANCHO] Soon he learned
the truth of our people's

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.309
sad history. The centuries
of oppression and slavery.

00:16:28.342 --> 00:16:31.315
Then, to our surprise...

00:16:31.348 --> 00:16:34.756
With tears streaming down
his face, he bowed his head

00:16:34.789 --> 00:16:38.061
and offered us his
deepest apologies.

00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:42.605
[GANCHO] Later, the King
devised a plan to help us.

00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:45.644
He enacted reparations.

00:16:47.213 --> 00:16:50.353
[GANCHO] He told us we no
longer needed to slave away.

00:16:50.386 --> 00:16:53.292
We could take anything we
required from the country.

00:16:53.326 --> 00:16:56.966
And we didn't need to
pay a thing in return.

00:16:59.705 --> 00:17:01.509
Huh? My bag's missing!

00:17:01.542 --> 00:17:02.712
[MAN J]
Uh! My watch is gone, too!

00:17:02.745 --> 00:17:04.516
[WOMAN B]
Has anyone seen my wallet?

00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:08.389
Oh, no! Someone has
stolen my favorite jacket!

00:17:08.422 --> 00:17:10.594
My Shusui was right here
a minute ago!

00:17:10.627 --> 00:17:12.396
Looks like they stole
from everyone!

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.234
But that's what
fairies do for fun!

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:15.737
What're you babblin' about?

00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:17.608
Fairies are fairies,
that's all I know.

00:17:17.641 --> 00:17:19.612
All you can do is laugh
and let it go!

00:17:19.645 --> 00:17:20.981
You want me to laugh?!

00:17:21.014 --> 00:17:23.520
Invisible fairies are the
guardians of Dressrosa

00:17:23.553 --> 00:17:26.291
since ancient times
and they're our ally!

00:17:26.324 --> 00:17:27.762
When they engage in mischief,

00:17:27.795 --> 00:17:30.232
the only thing to do
is turn a blind eye!

00:17:30.266 --> 00:17:33.139
Well, if fairies stole from us,
I guess that's okay then!

00:17:33.172 --> 00:17:34.842
Let's forget about it!

00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:37.046
[FRANKY sobs]

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:39.083
King Riku declared
that our actions

00:17:39.117 --> 00:17:40.620
were the work of fairies.

00:17:40.654 --> 00:17:43.760
So the citizens accepted
them with good humor.

00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:45.897
The legend of the
Dressrosa Fairies

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:49.237
was born and
continues to this day.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.143
That is so cool!
I love this Riku guy!

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:54.815
[GANCHO] Under the rule of
the benevolent Riku Dynasty,

00:17:54.848 --> 00:17:56.786
a helping hand was always lent

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.457
to neighboring countries
when they were in need.

00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:01.261
Although I can't say
that the kingdom

00:18:01.294 --> 00:18:04.669
was especially wealthy,
its people were always smiling

00:18:04.702 --> 00:18:07.106
and the world thought
of them warmly.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.748
Our ancestors paid tribute to
King Riku by planting flowers

00:18:10.781 --> 00:18:13.185
and greenery over the
whole countryside.

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:15.791
It was a labor of love
that continued

00:18:15.824 --> 00:18:19.932
until the entire kingdom
shimmered like a rainbow.

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:23.907
The Tontatta are linked to the
Riku family by a bond of respect

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.346
that's been nourished
for over 800 years.

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:32.491
But alas, those many
years of prosperity

00:18:32.525 --> 00:18:33.894
may be coming to an end.

00:18:33.927 --> 00:18:36.498
The Don Quixote family
has returned.

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:38.335
Their descendant is king.

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:41.510
Doflamingo cares not
for the Tontatta Tribe.

00:18:41.543 --> 00:18:44.281

my daughter, Mancherie,

00:18:59.277 --> 00:19:02.651
and now that he's taken
500 of our people hostage,

make slaves of us all.
