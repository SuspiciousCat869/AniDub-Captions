00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:18.003
I don't care. I'm done.
Good riddance.

00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:20.906
The point of having a plan
is to follow through with it.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.576
I should've known better than
to trust you with anything.

00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:25.244
We gotta get him back, now!

00:12:25.277 --> 00:12:27.480
Bleh.

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:34.320
[NARRATOR] Although Law's plan
was far from complete,

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:36.322
the Straw Hats had
defeated Caesar,

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:39.892
freed the children,
and reduced his lab to ruins.

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:47.967
[NARRATOR] Undeterred by
its master's defeat,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.269
Land of the Dead
continued its advance,

00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:52.605
filling Building A
and most of Building B

00:12:52.638 --> 00:12:54.974
with its poisonous mass.

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:05.184
[ALL screaming]

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.888
[NARRATOR] The control room
was safe for the time,

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:10.823
but its collapse was inevitable.

00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:13.526
[USOPP] You guys are really
making me sweat here.

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:16.362
[gasps] C'mon, hurry!

00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:17.563
[NARRATOR]
Luffy and his allies wait

00:13:17.596 --> 00:13:19.665
near the only exit
from the island,

00:13:19.698 --> 00:13:23.035
but Brook and Chopper
are nowhere to be found.

00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:26.605
Hang in there, Brownie.
We're gonna fix you right up.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.375
Chopper will be
here soon, I'm sure.

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:37.183
Hey, Luffy. You think...
they're okay?

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:39.985
[LUFFY]
Of course they are.

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:41.520
They'll get here.

00:13:41.554 --> 00:13:43.656
I know they will!

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:06.245
[NARRATOR] A short time ago,
a strange sight could be seen

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.848
in the skies near Punk Hazard.

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:14.987
[NARRATOR]
Little did the Straw Hats know

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.989
what they were in for.

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:19.692
[BUFFALO grunting]

00:14:19.725 --> 00:14:22.795
[BABY 5] Once this mission
is over, then I'm done.

00:14:22.828 --> 00:14:26.332
I'll kill him. You hear me?
With my own hands.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:29.535
I won't forgive you,
Joker! So cruel!

00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:32.104
It wasn't enough to
blow up my dear fiancée--

00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:34.473
you had to burn his
whole town to ash, too!

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.308
He did you no wrong!

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:38.744
How many men must you kill?

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:42.314
Every time I get engaged, you
blow my darling to little bits!

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:46.352
Eight men and eight towns!
Enough is enough!

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:48.087
Why won't he let me be happy?

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.156
Eeh! That's just how
he shows his love!

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.892
He's just protective!

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:55.828
He thinks of you like his little
sister. That sorta thing.

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:57.229
Him blowin' up a town or two's

00:14:57.263 --> 00:15:00.132
just a sign of how
much he cares!

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:02.601
Besides, this only happens
'cause you haven't learned

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:04.603
how to say no to those chumps.

00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:06.238
And what made him a "chump"?

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:10.075
He said he needed me.
How could I turn my back on him?

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:16.115
It's love at first sight.
Will you marry me?

00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:17.716
What?!

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:20.986
[chuckling]

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.623
[ALL chuckling]

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:29.895
[BABY 5] Just ten days after
that sweet, innocent confession,

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:33.499
he became the eighth victim.

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:34.667
It's all my fault!

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.236
If he hadn't met me,
he'd still be alive!

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:38.704
Look, here's the deal.

00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:42.474
Just 'cause someone asks,
you don't gotta say yes.

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:46.278
You don't need 50 newspaper
subscriptions. No one does!

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:48.447
And stop lending out
all of your money!

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.849
Or wasting it on crap
you don't need!

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:53.452
Sheesh! How much
debt do you got?

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:54.987
Why d'you care?

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.589
It's 98 million, that's all.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:01.660
This is none of your
business. I'm fine.

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:06.632
If you're fine, lend me
some. Say, two mil?

00:16:06.665 --> 00:16:08.000
What?!

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:10.602
[BABY 5]
He needs me!

00:16:11.904 --> 00:16:15.607
Um... Can I pay you later?

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:16.575
[BUFFALO]
Mh-hm!

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:19.778
When we're done,
I need it to go gamblin'!

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.013
Okay, then.

00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:24.683
Once we finish our mission, I'll
take out a new loan for you.

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:28.787
[BUFFALO grunting]

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:38.330
Joker needed me
to carry this out.

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:42.067
After that, it's over.
Bastard's as good as dead.

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:51.810
Neh! That's it! Punk
Hazard, straight ahead!

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:57.182
[BABY 5]
I can't see anything.

00:16:57.216 --> 00:17:00.886
Caesar's gas is covering
the whole island.

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:02.154
[sighs]

00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:08.727
If I shoot it,
will that help any?

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:10.963
No way. Hop off.

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:14.933
I've got this. No problem.
I'll be quick!

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:16.969
Sure. Try it.

00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:35.954
[yells]

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:39.825
It's typhoon time. Let's go!

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:46.265
[BUFFALO]
Storm Gust... Matasaburo!

00:17:57.776 --> 00:17:59.044
Huh?

00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:11.056
They'll be here soon.
Caesar, Monet, and Vergo, too.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.125
[laughs]

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:16.795
I sure can't wait to spend
all your money at the casino!

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:21.633
[whooshing]

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:24.736
[BUFFALO]
Hm? What's that weird noise?

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.140
[whooshing]

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:30.409
[BABY 5]
It's coming from the poison.

00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:34.780
[gasps]

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:42.588
What?!

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.556
Did one of the tanks
just explode?

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.594
Nuh-uh. Something went
flying into the ship!

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:49.895
[gasps]

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.570
[BABY 5]
Not something. Someone.

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:03.275
[gasps] Wait, that's Caesar!

00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:05.110
What the hell?!

00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:12.017
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL B ringing]

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.485
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL B]
Cu-lick!

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.955
[BUFFALO]
Joker, this is Buffalo.

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.924
I got some bad news.

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:19.892
[DOFLAMINGO]
What's up?

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.827
[BUFFALO]
Well, y'see, we made it,

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.963
but it looks like something
went down before we got here.

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:28.100
We just saw Master Caesar,
but he was all busted up.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:30.736
He went flying outta the
lab and into the tanker,

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:33.105
like someone kicked
his ass hard.

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:34.873
Is that so?

00:19:40.812 --> 00:19:44.116
I don't care what state he's
in--grab Caesar immediately.

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:46.818
Get outta there and
bring him to Dressrosa.

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:51.657
Cool. I'm on it, boss.
Be back in no time.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:56.662
But Monet and Vergo!

00:19:56.695 --> 00:20:00.232
Just do what he says.
There must be some reason.

00:20:00.265 --> 00:20:02.668
[BUFFALO]
Okay! So long!

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:04.169
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL B]
Cu-lick!

00:20:06.405 --> 00:20:11.410
[chuckling]

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.682
[DOFLAMINGO]
Bunch of damned rookies.

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:19.518
Blow up the lab.
What the hell do I care?

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:22.387
It'll take more
than that to beat me.

00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:24.756
All that matters is Caesar.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.994
As long as I have him,
I can make all the SAD I need.

00:20:29.027 --> 00:20:34.800
[laughing]

00:20:50.882 --> 00:20:53.485
[LAW]
Hey, it's time. Let's move.

00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:55.053
Get on the cart.

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.203
[grunts]

00:21:11.236 --> 00:21:14.473
Looks bad! I wonder what
happened to the guy.

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:21.313
Wait, there's someone
down on the deck.

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:22.648
But that can't be right.

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:25.017
No way. Not with all that gas.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.519
You're sure it's not just some
dead body or something?

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:30.255
[gasps] Wait a sec!

00:21:53.378 --> 00:21:55.180
It's a robot!

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:05.857
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:09.361
Man, that is one messed
up lookin' bird!

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:19.371
[NARRATOR] As the countdown
to R Building's destruction

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:21.340
dwindles ever closer to zero,

00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:24.309
Luffy continues to wait for
all of his friends to gather.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:27.612
Meanwhile, outside, the powerful
team of Baby 5 and Buffalo

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:29.848
are challenged to an
intense two-on-one battle

00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:32.684
by the tough-as-nails
General Franky!

00:22:32.718 --> 00:22:34.586
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:34.619 --> 00:22:37.956
"Running Wild!
Invincible General Franky!"

00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:40.559
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
