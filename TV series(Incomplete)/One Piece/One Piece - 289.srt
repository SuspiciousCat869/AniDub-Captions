1
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,092
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,362
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:45,232
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:50,203
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,339
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,440
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,777
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,313
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,483
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:06,053
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,222
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,531
Third Gear!

13
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,335
It's open.

14
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,512
All right! Time to head out!

15
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:09,282
No way! How'd you
make yourself all tiny?

16
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,790
All right! Back to normal!

17
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,559
Hang on, Robin!

18
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,261
Stupid pigeon guy!

19
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:23,230
I can't wait to kick your ass!

20
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,131
Secret Technique.

21
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,369
Owl Thrashing!

22
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,075
Chapapapapapapa!

23
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,244
Beans Left!

24
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,520
You call that an attack?

25
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:51,725
This is terrible!

26
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,228
He's right--He's
fighting on our side now.

27
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,096
I better help him.

28
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,066
There it is! The real stuff!

29
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,235
That's cola, for sure!
Come to papa!

30
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,240
Super!

31
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,379
Chapapapa. Oh, come on!

32
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,781
It's not like
anything's gonna change

33
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,582
'cause you drank some cola.

34
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,220
Get ready.

35
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,056
Chapa? For what?

36
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,091
Another round of
your flimsy punches?

37
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,292
Gimme a break.

38
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:31,498
Strong Hammer!

39
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,268
Dobeba!

40
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,417
Amazing!

41
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:05,532
Oh, you were right.

42
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,602
My punches were pretty flimsy.

43
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:12,472
But don't worry--that's
all gonna change.

44
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,543
"Zoro Busts Out a New Technique!

45
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,446
The Sword's Name
is Sniper King?"

46
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,271
Oh, hey, Franky.

47
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,575
I've gotta tell you something
while there's still time.

48
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,477
Zoro and Sniper King got
their wrists cuffed together

49
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,179
with those Sea
Prism Stone Handcuffs!

50
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:13,433
They what?

51
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:16,036
You're tellin' me we're on
the hunt for two keys now?

52
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,239
One for Robin and
those two bozos?

53
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,506
Yeah, exactly.

54
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,076
How stupid can this get?

55
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,445
Alright. At least I know
how deep of a hole we're in.

56
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,518
Chapa!

57
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,056
You've really
got me fired up now!

58
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,125
Chapapapapapapapa!

59
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,196
Oh, boy. He just
won't stay down.

60
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,364
Talk about tough.

61
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:45,465
Oh, I'll show you tough.

62
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:53,540
Franky.

63
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,375
Destroyer canon!

64
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,510
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

65
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,080
I've gotta dislocate
my shoulders to do this.

66
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,350
Maybe you shouldn't do it then!

67
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,552
Chapapapa. Moron.
That won't work.

68
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,254
I'm a Six Powers master.

69
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,556
No bullet can move
as quickly as I can!

70
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:14,128
It doesn't matter how much
you run around or how fast.

71
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,462
It's practically
impossible for anyone

72
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,365
to escape my
Franky Destroyer Canon.

73
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,367
These aren't just any canons.

74
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,803
They're loaded with
tracking cannonballs!

75
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,339
Tracking cannonballs?

76
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,041
Does he mean they're cannonballs

77
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,509
that can sense their
target and track it down?

78
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,357
I've never even heard
of technology like that!

79
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,525
This guy's amazing!

80
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,534
Hey, wait!

81
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,170
You mean all the
"tracking" is done by you?

82
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,005
How can you still
run that damn fast?

83
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,009
Chapapa, why am I letting

84
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,411
this idiot chase
me around like this?

85
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,019
Aw, man, he disappeared again.

86
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,524
Come out!

87
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,495
Searching for me is pointless.

88
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,164
I'm a master of
the Shave technique.

89
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,231
With its power,

90
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,468
not only am I faster
than the speed of lightning,

91
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,470
I'm also completely silent.

92
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:33,107
Just like an owl
patiently hunting his prey.

93
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,444
I always carry out a
flawless assassination.

94
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,084
Just like an owl, huh?

95
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,018
Precisely.

96
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,221
My target doesn't
realize I'm upon them

97
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,256
until the moment of their death.

98
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,028
He was hiding over here.

99
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,333
Yeah, all that bragging
was real stealthy of you.

100
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:04,305
Cocky jerk. How dare you
humiliate me like this!

101
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:07,507
No one humiliates CP9 and lives!

102
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,210
Shave!

103
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:17,551
Iron ball!

104
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,124
Whoa! Be careful!

105
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,394
Dammit! We're over the ocean!

106
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,301
Franky!

107
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,241
This is bad!

108
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:45,045
The current's too strong.

109
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,147
It'll drag him
straight to the waterfall.

110
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,283
And there's nothing I can
do to help him in the sea.

111
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:54,387
Franky! Swim
with all your might!

112
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,394
Chapapa. No matter
what, I'll be fine.

113
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,496
I'll just use my
moonwalk if I go over.

114
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,633
Not good. I can hardly move.

115
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,601
Talk about a
damn strong current.

116
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,436
And I'm gonna run out of air.

117
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,072
I'm doubly screwed, here.

118
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,307
Chapapa!
Just hurry up and drown!

119
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,017
Yoyoi!

120
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,086
There's no way.

121
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,154
He busted out of the fridge?

122
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:36,563
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

123
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:39,433
Thank you. Thank you.

124
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,069
Thank you.

125
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:50,210
Thank you! I am so full!

126
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,379
Holy crap, he got fat!

127
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,214
You cannot be serious!

128
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,416
Did you eat every
piece of food in there?

129
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:09,362
I really don't have
any desire to die today!

130
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,568
I'm already at the basin!

131
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,503
Don't fall!
Don't fall! Don't go over!

132
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,373
Franky Butterfly!

133
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,787
Chapapapa! You are
going over that waterfall!

134
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,322
Moon Walk!

135
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,332
Solid Beast!

136
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,239
Ugly bastard!

137
00:12:58,512 --> 00:12:59,346
Chapa!

138
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,249
Weapons Left! Eat this!

139
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,017
Paper Art!

140
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,188
Slime!

141
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,090
Chapapapapapapapa!

142
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,293
Come on! What the hell was that?

143
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,264
So close! Too bad!

144
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:19,400
Dammit. This is serious.

145
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:22,302
I've gotta get to shore, pronto!

146
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:27,107
One Liter Cola Cannon!
Coup de Boo!

147
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:31,011
Chapa!

148
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:32,246
Didn't learn your lesson, huh?

149
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,349
It takes more than strength
to defeat a Six Powers Master!

150
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:38,218
Strong Hammer!

151
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,319
Paper Art!

152
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,791
Now fall over the edge!

153
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,328
Strong Right!

154
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,769
Let's go!

155
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:22,596
Chapa!

156
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,502
Lemme go, you jerk!

157
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,304
I can't do the
Moon Walk with one foot

158
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,305
when I'm carrying someone else!

159
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:35,509
You're gonna make us fall!

160
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,745
Yeah, I realize that.

161
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:39,813
Tell ya what,
I'll let go of your leg.

162
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:42,483
After you've taken
me back to shore.

163
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:44,818
We could fight it out on land.

164
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,787
Or you could put all your energy

165
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,323
into fighting me right now
and see where that gets us.

166
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:51,725
I prefer the first option.

167
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:55,462
But if I'm goin' down those
falls, you're comin' to.

168
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,799
You and me. We're in
the same boat here.

169
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,167
So why don't we
just go back to shore?

170
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:07,207
Good job, that's
some fine kickin'.

171
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,178
Good, good. We're
almost there. Keep at it.

172
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,414
Chapapa. Just so you know.

173
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:16,517
This battle is gonna end
as soon as we're there.

174
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,153
Oh? Is that a fact?

175
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:20,788
Chapapapapapa!

176
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:22,389
Your damn right it's a fact.

177
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,758
'Cause I just remembered
a little technique of mine

178
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,428
that's sure to finish
you off in a single blow!

179
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:33,434
How funny. That makes
two of us, Fukurou.

180
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,068
Chapa?

181
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,184
Robin! I'm comin' for ya, Robin!

182
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:51,518
Shout if you can hear me!

183
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,722
We'll save you! No matter what!

184
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,423
I made you a promise, Robin.

185
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,193
We're not gonna leave
this island without you!

186
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:02,496
I don't care what happens, I'm
gonna get you back from them.

187
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,465
Robin!

188
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,209
Where the hell is
that number 2 key?

189
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:16,377
Zoro! I'm finished!

190
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,213
I'm too tired!
Gimme a piggyback!

191
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:20,380
No way!

192
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,083
Tempest Kick!

193
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,792
Finger Pistol!

194
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:32,459
What was that for?

195
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,161
Don't play innocent with me!

196
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,430
You were just pretending
to fire that kick at them.

197
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:37,531
You were aiming
for me, weren't you?

198
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:40,301
That's the most paranoid
accusation I've ever heard.

199
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,170
But I will admit you have
been getting in my way,

200
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,705
so if you wanna
fight, I'm ready.

201
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:45,839
What'd you say?

202
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:48,175
You've been getting in
my way, you stupid herbivore!

203
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,410
What are you talking about?

204
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,412
I like meat just as
much as the next guy.

205
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:54,281
Don't lie to me,
you long-necked freak!

206
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,449
You're a giraffe!

207
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,284
Now why don't you run along
and eat some tree leaves?

208
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,453
I can tell you're pretty
insistent on fighting me.

209
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,422
So why don't you just sit
tight and wait for me here.

210
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:04,058
I'll finish off
the prey on my own

211
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,826
and then we can settle this.

212
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,027
Hold it!

213
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,730
We're gonna fight alright,
but you're not taking my prey!

214
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,232
Wow! I've always
wondered about this!

215
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,467
You too, Zoro!

216
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,236
Didn't you just
ask me the other day

217
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:17,737
who you think is stronger,
a giraffe or a wolf?

218
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,309
I bet you're just
dying to find out.

219
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:23,343
Not really.

220
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,412
I see! Yep, I guess
we're both really curious

221
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,381
to see who'd win in
a fight between them!

222
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,215
No, I said I--

223
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:31,384
Just leave this
one to me, alright?

224
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:35,556
So the prediction of the world's
most feared pirate hunter

225
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:39,760
and the notorious swordsman of
the Straw Hat Pirates is-- oh!

226
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:43,297
He gets the feeling the wolf has
the greater edge strength wise!

227
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,065
Of course I do!

228
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,534
What's that you say? Really?

229
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,271
You don't think we should
overlook the giraffe though?

230
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,206
Very true, that is a good point!

231
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,409
That Sky Slicer of his was
pretty impressive indeed!

232
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:58,178
Yeah, it was powerful.

233
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,115
The fact is that wolves
aren't much more than cunning.

234
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,182
But beyond that,

235
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:04,318
they aren't exactly the
most capable of creatures.

236
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,487
You bastard!
That's the final straw!

237
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,155
So you wanna do this right now?

238
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:11,825
Excellent. Alright.
Now's our chance, Zoro.

239
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,026
I get it!

240
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,429
You're trying to get them to
stop paying attention to us

241
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,231
and start fighting each other,

242
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,465
and then we'll make our escape

243
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,301
while they're distracted, right?

244
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,736
Are you for real?
That just occurred to you?

245
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,706
And why are you sharing
that information with them?

246
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:26,773
I'm kind of embarrassed,

247
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:29,109
but you actually had us
going for a minute there.

248
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,145
The prey is always
the first priority.

249
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:34,415
Geez, Zoro! What am
I supposed to do with you?

250
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,449
We almost got away

251
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:38,052
and you completely
ruined the plan!

252
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:39,820
Big deal, it was a
pretty terrible plan

253
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,188
in the first place.

254
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:43,357
I've got an even
better survival plan!

255
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,424
Just do me a favor, Zoro,

256
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,394
and please keep your
mouth sealed shut this time.

257
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:52,465
Hmm, a giraffe or a wolf,
I wonder which one is cooler?

258
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,736
There's more to
life than just strength!

259
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:57,738
There are the
truly important things.

260
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:58,672
For example!

261
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,441
Being known as the
most stylish and hip!

262
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:08,048
Hm, which one is it?

263
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,818
Well, I'm having a
little trouble arguing

264
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:12,286
with his logic on this one.

265
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,787
Nothing to argue about.

266
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,256
Everyone knows that wolves

267
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:17,524
are both stronger
and cooler than giraffes.

268
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:18,458
You are so full of it!

269
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,828
All you have to do
is go to any zoo to see

270
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:23,464
that giraffes are a
million times more popular

271
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:24,531
with kids than wolves are!

272
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:27,134
Which obviously means
that giraffes are cooler!

273
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,304
Just the kind of stupid point
I'd expect a tall horse to make.

274
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,273
Don't you ever call me a horse.

275
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:34,174
I'm a giraffe, dammit.

276
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,778
It's working! Let's go!

277
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:40,047
That kind of distraction

278
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,282
won't last long enough
for us to get away.

279
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:43,183
What? Well, I sure hope you have

280
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,152
some sort of backup plan then.

281
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,155
Rock, paper, scissors.
You and me.

282
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,791
These cuffs are
the real problem.

283
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:53,527
But I've thought of a way
we can get them off of us.

284
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,728
Really?

285
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,797
What's it have to do with
playing rock, paper, scissors?

286
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,134
Whoever loses has to
chop off his own hand.

287
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:06,140
That is the most terrifying
idea I've ever heard!

288
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:07,808
I'm not done explaining,
just listen!

289
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:10,411
The first thing
we do once we've got

290
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:13,280
these cuffs off us is run
like hell until we find Chopper.

291
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:14,481
With his medical expertise,

292
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,317
he'll be able to
sew the hand back on

293
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,818
in no time at
all, understand?

294
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:20,453
We're not rag dolls!
Don't be ridiculous!

295
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,291
Wait.

296
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:27,394
I've got another plan
to get us out of this mess.

297
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,729
I don't even wanna hear it!

298
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:34,034
We won't be able to settle
this with words alone.

299
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,769
I'm ready to go when you are.

300
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:36,770
And let's up the stakes,

301
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,706
the winner gets to keep
the prey all to himself.

302
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,054
What the--?

303
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:04,464
Shing!

304
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,471
Alright, Sniper King.
Just hold that posture.

305
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:12,172
You are now a sword.

306
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,540
Someone get me a lawyer!

307
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:18,044
There is no way I am not
gonna sue your ass off for this!

308
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:21,282
So, what's your plan now?

309
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:23,450
Just take me to shore already.

310
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,453
I wanna hurry up and knock
you out and get this over with.

311
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:29,423
That's it. I'm sick
of your talking.

312
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:30,390
Sick of it.

313
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:33,093
I'm gonna shut you up
right here and now!

314
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:39,166
Super Cartwheel Iron Ball!

315
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:42,168
I'm gonna slam you into the
tower and smash you to pieces!

316
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:45,405
That's your plan?

317
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:48,308
Well that would pulverize
me, gotta give you that.

318
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:51,344
Franky Centaur!

319
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:55,783
Chapa?

320
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,284
I've got both your legs.

321
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,219
As long as I've got
you bound like this,

322
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:00,454
you can't move around!

323
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,189
That doesn't mean anything.

324
00:22:02,222 --> 00:22:03,223
At the speed we're going.

325
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:06,093
There's nothing you can do
to slow us down now!

326
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:08,528
Well, let's just see about that.

327
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:13,067
70 mm Caliber Cola Cannon!

328
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,468
Just a little Coup de Vent!

329
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:20,140
He stopped our momentum!

330
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:23,476
We're not even
rotating anymore! Damn you!

331
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,145
That's far enough.

332
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,113
We're right above the shore.

333
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:31,118
Now, take this. 70 mm Caliber.

334
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:34,521
1 point 5 Max
Cola Power! Coup de--

335
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,489
Stop it! What're
you trying to do?

336
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:42,429
Just give up already,
you bastard!

337
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:45,833
Coup de--

338
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,434
Vent!

339
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:59,279
Super!

340
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:16,430
I'm sorry, Doctorine.
I can't keep my word.

341
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:18,766
Maybe I am just like
the doctor after all.

342
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,169
If he put his life on the
line to save his country,

343
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:26,140
then I want to put my life
on the line to save my friends.

344
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:28,108
Everyone, please stay away.

345
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:30,210
I'm about to lose control.

346
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,177
On the next One Piece:

347
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:34,147
"Uncontrollable!
Chopper's Forbidden Rumble!"

348
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:36,316
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
