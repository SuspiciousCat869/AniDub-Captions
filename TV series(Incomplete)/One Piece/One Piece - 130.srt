00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,205
We gotta fight.

174
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,306
Then let's go!

175
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,575
What's this?!

176
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,743
[NAMI]
Oh, that?

177
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,411
Usopp said to hold
onto 'em in case

178
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,547
we needed 'em for something.
Who knows.

179
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,483
‐‐C'mon!
‐‐They're in our way!

180
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,484
I'll get rid of 'em.

181
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,153
[OFFICER] Take your positions.
Once we pull up,

182
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,521
everyone attacks!

183
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,061
[LUFFY]
Okay! Now we ready?

184
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,032
Now's our chance!

185
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,667
Full‐speed ahead! Shake 'em off!

186
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,706
[VIVI]
Now, Karoo.

187
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,041
[KAROO squawks]

188
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,212
Let's go to Alubarna!

189
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,247
[KAROO squawks]

190
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,290
[VIVI] Although my adventure is
over, a new challenge awaits.

191
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,292
Restoring Alabasta.

192
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,394
I'll need more courage
than I've ever found

193
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,463
if I'm to succeed in
bringing my homeland

194
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,532
to its former glory.

195
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,767
This once proud nation
is like a battered ship

196
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,270
wandering aimlessly at sea.

197
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,039
But I believe no
cause is hopeless,

198
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,374
not as long as you
give it your all

199
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,742
and don't give up!

200
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,244
Alabasta may be
adrift right now,

201
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,713
but I know my people!

202
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,781
They will face the oncoming
waves of fear

203
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,050
and uncertainty with bravery!

204
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,052
We will never be discouraged!

205
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,222
The path ahead, though long
and rough, is clear.

206
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,558
We will push forward,
straight ahead,

207
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,560
with confidence and vigor!

208
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,730
Just like the Going Merry
and her crew!

209
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,731
The Straw Hats.

210
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,767
We will see them again someday,
won't we, Karoo?

211
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,068
[KAROO squawks]

212
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,206
[KAROO squawks]

213
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,698
Hey, Captain Smoker.

214
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:09,602
[SMOKER]
Tashigi. So how are your legs?

215
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,736
They're doing fine.

216
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,371
Change the subject.

217
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,217
[TASHIGI]
Thank you.

218
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,722
I saw the new bounties
on their heads.

219
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,925
[SMOKER] The amount's no
surprise considering the catch.

220
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,661
Have you heard what
his swordsman buddy did?

221
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,929
You mean Roronoa?

222
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,434
He cut down one hundred bounty
hunters in Whisky Peak,

223
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,905
and then, in Alubarna,
he killed Daz Bones.

224
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,274
The assassin? No way!

225
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,276
[SMOKER] He used to be a
bounty hunter and was known

226
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,977
throughout the West Blue.

227
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,581
In Baroque Works, he went
by the alias Mr. 1.

228
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,317
Considering Crocodile had
so many famous warriors

229
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,252
at his command,
you'd think they'd be

230
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,922
unstoppable against
any opposition.

231
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,592
However, fate was not kind.

232
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,661
One day we'll have a rematch.

233
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,362
Damn Straw Hats.

234
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:16,469
[TASHIGI] Yes, and I will
defeat you, Roronoa Zoro.

235
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,671
[ZORO] Looks like the Marines
have stopped following us.

236
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,440
[GROUP groaning]

237
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,843
[ZORO] That's good news,
we shook 'em off!

238
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:28,447
[GROUP groaning]

239
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,515
Stop it!

240
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,383
What's with the pathetic groans?

241
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,021
I miss her!

242
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,656
[ZORO]
That's enough whining!

243
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,526
If you wanted her
to join that bad,

244
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,394
then you shouldn't
have let her leave!

245
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,796
Ah! You savage!

246
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,830
Blockhead!

247
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:45,831
Idiot.

248
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,966
Three Swords Style.

249
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,569
Saying "Three Swords Style"
isn't an insult, Luffy.

250
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,637
Four Swords Style.

251
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,738
[USOPP] It's not the number
that's the problem.

252
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,741
An effective insult must
involve some personal detail

253
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,010
about the recipient that's
rude or disparaging!

254
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,646
[ROBIN] Looks like we finally
escaped the firing squad!

255
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,881
[ZORO]
Yeah.

256
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:02,982
Excellent work.

257
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,817
[GROUP gasps]

258
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,419
Here to avenge your friends?
Just try it!

259
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:08,921
What the hell
are you doing here?!

260
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,857
‐‐[USOPP] Warning. Warning.
‐‐[CHOPPER yelling]

261
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,660
[CHOPPER]
Who's she?

262
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,830
I don't know,
but she's so damn beautiful!

263
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,737
[weapons clatter]

264
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,105
Didn't I tell you before?

265
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,507
Don't point such
dangerous objects at me.

266
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,009
Are you always so slow?

267
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,877
How long have
you been on our ship?

268
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,579
[ROBIN]
Quite a while.

269
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,515
These are your clothes, right?
I'm borrowing them.

270
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,383
Just a minute, lady!

00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,718
Who in the hell
do you think you are?

00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,520
Monkey D. Luffy.

273
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,422
It hasn't been so long
that you've forgotten

274
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,590
what you did to me, has it?

275
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,858
[SANJI growls]

276
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:46,725
Luffy!

277
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,460
What'd you do to
that beautiful woman,

00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,462
you lousy bastard?
Tell me! Confess!

279
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,699
[USOPP] All stowaways must
leave the ship immediately!

280
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,701
Wait a minute! Stop lying!

281
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,603
You know I didn't
do anything to you!

282
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,470
Wrong.

283
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,040
And what you did to me
was unbearable.

284
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,642
Go ahead. Admit it.

285
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,078
[CHOPPER] Who's that woman
and what's she talking about?

286
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,913
[USOPP] ...all mystery chicks
vacate the ship

287
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,582
or we'll be forced
to call the Marines.

288
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,083
Thank you for voyaging
on the Going Merry.

289
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,251
[SANJI]
...tear you apart!

290
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,721
You're not makin' any sense.
What do you want me to do?

291
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,825
I want to join you.

292
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,728
[GROUP]
What?!

293
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,434
[ROBIN]
Use that, immediately!

294
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,904
It can neutralize the poison
from Crocodile's hook.

295
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,606
Even if he was
buried in this rubble,

296
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,907
there's a chance
he might survive

297
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,809
since he's actually rubber.

298
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,779
[COBRA] You looked me straight
in the eye and told me

299
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,616
that the only thing
written here was history!

300
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,921
Why did you lie to me?

301
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,158
You knew?

302
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,793
How cruel.

303
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,162
[COBRA] The truth is, this
country's history isn't written

304
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,664
anywhere in there.

305
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,633
Instead, it has everything
about the weapon

306
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,501
you wanted to get your hands on.

307
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,603
The description, location.

308
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,138
It doesn't make any sense.

309
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,040
If you had told Crocodile
this information,

310
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,442
this country would now
be his for the taking.

311
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,543
Isn't that right?

312
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,647
I'm not interested.

313
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,516
Whether people in
this country live or die...

314
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,119
It really makes
no difference to me.

315
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,054
I had already decided
from the start

316
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,657
not to give Crocodile
the weapon.

317
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,125
[COBRA]
I don't understand.

318
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,994
Then why did you come here?

319
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:32,197
I don't really know anymore.

320
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,667
Chasing a dream, I suppose.

321
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,834
An empty dream.

322
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,805
The last remaining
Poneglyph in the world

323
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,808
that still carries
the true history.

324
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,580
The Rio Poneglyph.

325
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,149
What do you mean by

326
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,717
the "true history"?

327
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,154
[ROBIN]
Nothing.

328
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,755
It doesn't matter now.

329
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,057
For 20 years I've searched,

330
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,826
and I've never had
a better lead than this.

331
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,661
This was my last hope.

332
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,229
And it didn't work out.

333
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,666
So if I'm going to die here,
it's the perfect time.

334
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,835
I'm tired of this
fool's crusade.

335
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,236
It's over.

336
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,777
All I wanted was
to learn our true history

337
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,016
and to share it with
the whole world.

338
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,186
So then, you're saying

339
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,288
that it's possible our lost
history could actually

340
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,222
be uncovered?

341
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,558
And the Poneglyphs
are the key to unlocking

342
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,625
these records?

343
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,530
[COBRA]
You mean, all this time...

344
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,637
'Kay. Let's go.

345
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,206
[ROBIN]
Hold on!

346
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,141
I no longer have
a reason to live!

347
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,744
Just leave me here!

348
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:52,711
You're coming with me.

349
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,547
Do what you want once
we're out of here.

350
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,586
[ROBIN] I wanted nothing
more than to die

351
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,321
at that very moment.

352
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,756
But you forced me to live.

353
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,991
That's your crime!

354
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,028
There's no place for me
to go, or return to.

355
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,430
So I've decided
that I'll join you.

356
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,433
I see your problem.
Guess there's no other choice.

357
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,069
‐‐Welcome.
‐‐[GROUP] Luffy!

358
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,771
There's nothing to worry about.

359
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,206
Trust me.
She isn't a bad person.

360
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,755
[laughing]

361
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,730
[USOPP]
Pay attention!

362
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,433
I want some straight‐up
and honest answers!

363
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,101
I'll ask you one more time.

364
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,202
What's your name?

365
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,373
My name's Usopp. Hello.

366
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,541
Nico Robin.

367
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,076
Okay, Nico Robin.

368
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,644
So what's your occupation?

369
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,812
Archaeologist.

370
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,313
Are you serious?

371
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,482
Archaeology runs in my blood.

372
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,284
I come from a long line of them.

373
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,385
[USOPP]
Hmm. I see.

374
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,154
So, your family has a
scientific background, huh?

375
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,422
[ZORO]
What in the hell?

376
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,457
[USOPP]
Go on!

377
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,425
It was when I was 8 years old

378
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,495
that I decided to pursue
archaeology as my career.

379
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:17,763
Shortly thereafter,

380
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,232
I found myself wanted
by the World Government.

381
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,101
Since then I've spent
the past 20 years

382
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,602
hiding from the world.

383
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,571
You've been alone?

384
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,239
Ever since you were 8?

385
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,309
Then one day,

386
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,810
I heard the calling of the sea,

387
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,612
but there's no way
for a child to survive

388
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:34,680
alone on the water.

389
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,349
The only option I found
that ensured my protection

390
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,685
and the ability to
achieve my goal was...

391
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,453
I chose to work
for various rogues.

392
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,323
Not an ideal solution,
but it brought me this far.

393
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,591
And here we are.

394
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,526
And I'm guessing you
incorporated Crocodile

395
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,628
into your gallery of rogues.

396
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,430
Of course.

397
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,600
I used him to get to
the Rio Poneglyph.

398
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,102
[USOPP]
Hmm...?

399
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,770
I'm good at maneuvering
through obstacles

400
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,272
to achieve a goal.

401
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,774
I'd be a great asset
to you and your friends.

402
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,611
Huh. You're full of confidence.

403
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,112
What's your specialty?

404
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,449
Killing.

405
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,285
Luffy! My investigation
has concluded that she is

406
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,453
far too dangerous!

407
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,155
[LUFFY, CHOPPER laughing]

408
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,457
You guys listening to me?

409
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,192
[NAMI]
Seriously!

410
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,628
I'm disappointed.
You two are pathetic!

411
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,696
Until recently, she was
the vice president

412
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,632
of a crime syndicate.

413
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:30,569
And you really think such
a woman should join us?

414
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,504
You may've fooled these idiots,

415
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,373
but I'm not convinced!

416
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:38,810
You pull anything, and I'll
personally kick you out!

417
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,878
All right.

418
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,914
I'll keep that in mind.

419
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,849
Oh, I just remembered.

420
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,351
I brought along some of
Crocodile's jewelry with me.

421
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,820
[NAMI squeals]

422
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,323
Wow, I love ya, sister!
You're the best!

423
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,158
[USOPP, ZORO]
Oh, boy, here we go.

424
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,493
Nami's been had.

425
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,827
This chick's bad news.

426
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,497
She's following her lead
like some kinda pet!

427
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,169
Ah, love. Bold.

428
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,737
The likes of which
I've never seen.

429
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,606
I'm captured by your spell.

430
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,875
Held prisoner in your eyes.

431
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:10,742
[NAMI]
Treasure!

432
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,744
[SANJI]
I was driftwood floating at sea

433
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,513
until you struck me
like a thunderbolt

434
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,782
igniting my soul.

435
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,183
A snack.

436
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,685
Ah, thank you.

437
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,787
[ZORO] Look at him.
Falling all over himself.

438
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:22,754
[USOPP]
Yeah.

439
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,457
Well, he was a lost
cause from the start.

440
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,392
[ZORO sighs]

441
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,194
Looks like you and
I are the only holdouts

442
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,263
on this ship of insanity.

443
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,531
We shouldn't blame the others.

444
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,600
Their simple minds
can't resist her charms.

445
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:35,767
[LUFFY]
Hey, Usopp!

446
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,703
Chopper.

447
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,937
[CHOPPER laughing]

448
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:43,208
[LUFFY, NAMI, CHOPPER]

449
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,545
[SANJI]
What should I call you? "Robin"?

450
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,214
Or something more daring
that declares my love?

451
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:51,817
Leaving?

452
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,488
[SANJI sighs]

453
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,656
She's great!

454
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,324
With an adult charm.

455
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,260
She's far different than Nami.

456
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,904
This ship has charm.

457
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,641
Is it always this lively?

458
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,676
Yeah, it usually is.

459
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,815
[ZORO]
This woman's up to something.

460
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:24,916
But what?

461
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,591
What's the forecast, Navigator?

462
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,992
Is it smooth sailing ahead?

463
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,762
[NAMI] The wind is calm
and the weather's beautiful.

464
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,930
There's no problems
on my end, Sis!

465
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,766
[ZORO] How would you know?
You haven't stopped gawking

466
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,600
at that jewelry!

467
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,935
[LUFFY]
Sanji! Is our snack ready?

468
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:44,970
[SANJI]
Be patient!

469
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,171
[LUFFY]
But I'm hungry!

470
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,707
[CHOPPER] Oh, yeah! Me too!
Me too! Me too! I want food!
