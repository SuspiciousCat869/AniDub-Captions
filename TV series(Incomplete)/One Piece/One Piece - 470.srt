1
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,723
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,426
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,729
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,565
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,368
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,037
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,006
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,876
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,511
they capture the
unwanted attention

10
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,045
of the World Government,

11
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,549
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,752
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:09,189
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:12,359
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:17,063
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,769
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of his crew,

17
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,004
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

18
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,873
to rescue his brother, Ace.

19
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:26,974
The Whitebeard Pirates have

20
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,809
successfully
pushed into the bay,

21
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:32,312
but a massive number of Marines
still block the path to Ace.

22
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,581
The battle is heating up!

23
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,685
[MIHAWK]
Apologies, Shanks.

24
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,254
[LUFFY panting]

25
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,358
[MIHAWK] But I will not
hold back against him.

26
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,193
Hey, I know him!

27
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,427
"Hawk-Eye"!

28
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,498
[MIHAWK]
I wonder, what is written?

29
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,767
Will my hand wipe
his name from history?

30
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,369
Or perhaps...

31
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,737
His fortune shall spare him

32
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,640
the fury of this
Black Sword I wield.

33
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,743
[panting]

34
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,581
[LUFFY]
"The Great Swordsman Mihawk!

35
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:11,084
Luffy Comes Under the Attack
of the Black Sword!"

36
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,056
[LUFFY] I don't have
time to get in a fight

37
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,927
with such a strong guy!
All I'm here to do is save Ace!

38
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,400
[LUFFY grunts]

39
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,169
[LUFFY]
Go! Second Gear!

40
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,203
[MIHAWK grunts]

41
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,078
[IVANKOV]
Hee-haw!

42
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,080
Death Wink!

43
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,453
[IVANKOV]
Galaxy Wink!

44
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,892
[LUFFY panting]

45
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,228
[IVANKOV]
That's it, Straw Boy, well done.

46
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:57,364
Just keep your eyes on the prize
and keep moving forward.

47
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,599
You let us handle the rest.

48
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,769
[IVANKOV yells]

49
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,741
[PIRATE A] Don't worry,
we'll deal with fancy pants!

50
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,542
Yee-hee-haw!

51
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,644
[PIRATE A]
Yeah!

52
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,914
Hey, "Hawk-Eye"! Remember the
time we challenged you?

53
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:17,784
Well, here comes a blast from
the past to kick your smug ass!

54
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,593
We're powered up now as New
Kamas and you're gonna feel it!

55
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,097
[PIRATE A, PIRATE B yell]

56
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,267
[MIHAWK]
I don't remember you.

57
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,671
You're worms
in a long line of them.

58
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:44,244
[MARINES, PIRATES shouting]

59
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,853
[pants]

60
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:56,690
Almost there! Keep running
and don't look back!

61
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,192
[MIHAWK shouts]

62
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,635
[LUFFY groans]

63
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,836
You're still in range.

64
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,341
[LUFFY yells]

65
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:27,287
Ow. Man. He got me.

66
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,657
[grunts]

67
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,227
[JIMBEI] Only Ace's brother
could survive that attack.

68
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,063
Anyone else would've been
sliced clean in half.

69
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,566
The turncoat, Jimbei.

70
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,733
I'm going to make sure

71
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,636
that's the last time
you so much as touch Luffy.

72
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,838
Even if it costs me my life!

73
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,140
[gasps] Why are you doing this?

74
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:50,043
For one, I don't want to
see Ace get murdered.

75
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,846
And I'd like to have
a peaceful sea for a change.

76
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,882
It may be too late
to avoid the war

77
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,886
we've gotten ourselves into now,
but there is still hope.

78
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,922
Namely, in that
daring kid over there.

79
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,391
[LUFFY grunting]

80
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,026
"Hope," you say?

81
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,062
We'll see what fate
lies in store for him.

82
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,565
But, as for you, I'd step back.

83
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,767
Fishman Karate!

84
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:20,607
[JIMBEI]
Arabesque Brick Fist!

85
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,125
Sharkskin Palm Thrust!

86
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:43,463
[JIMBEI]
Shark Brick Fist!

87
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,706
[JIMBEI grunting]

88
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,884
That guy's a monster. Aw, crap.

89
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,053
[IVANKOV groaning]

90
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,355
[IVANKOV pants]
Huh?

91
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,690
He's going in for the kill!

92
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,527
[LUFFY gasps]

93
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,738
Bastard!

94
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,007
Now, Gum-Gum...

95
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,248
[LUFFY]
...Jet Bazoo--!

96
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:37,551
[LUFFY gasping]

97
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,088
[pants]

98
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,223
Too close.

99
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,826
He'd've sliced my arms
right off if I'd attacked.

100
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,062
So, you're smarter
than you look.

101
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,263
[LUFFY gasps]

102
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:56,570
[MARINES, PIRATES gasping]

103
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,357
[MARINE AA] Okay,
a sword should not do that.

104
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,927
Can we please call that thing
something other than a sword?

105
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,566
[COBY]
Uh, he's definitely earned

106
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:28,002
that world's strongest
swordsman title.

107
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,037
[HELMEPPO whimpering]

108
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,906
He's stronger than
a mountain of ice?

109
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:34,341
There's no way
Straw Hat's gonna survive.

110
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,909
Not if he's fighting him.

111
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,247
[VISTA]
Hmm?

112
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:45,085
That's why you
don't slice icebergs!

113
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,233
[BUGGY] Stealthy footsteps,
no one sees me.

114
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:06,006
[BUGGY] All right, you guys
ready? Time to put operation:

115
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,841
"Make Captain Buggy
Look Like a Bad Ass

116
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,744
In Front of The World"
into action.

117
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,378
[whispering] The Navy
loves propaganda,

118
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,714
so I'm sure they're
broadcasting the war.

119
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:17,017
We just gotta find us
a Video Transponder Snail.

120
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:18,985
Let's go.

121
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,055
[PRISONERS whispering]
Yeah.

122
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,358
It's shocking how easy
it is to encourage them

123
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:25,892
with such vague directions.

124
00:10:34,602 --> 00:10:36,737
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

125
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,340
So, you wanna team up? Nonsense.

126
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:42,642
Why not? The reign of these
antiquated, geriatric pirates

127
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,845
like Whitebeard
is coming to an end.

128
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,513
He's the last of them.

129
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:50,384
We're on the brink of
a new era and it belongs to us.

130
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:54,054
An era where all that matters
is the power you yield.

131
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:58,392
Sounds appealing, right?
You know you want a piece of it.

132
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:00,427
[CROCODILE]
Hmm.

133
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:03,697
Oh, come on, now. I can tell
that you're intrigued.

134
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:08,369
Sure, technically, you've
been stripped of your title,

135
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:09,970
but when you get down to it,

136
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,074
we're both Warlords
at heart, aren't we?

137
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:15,542
Stop looking at me
like you're my equal.

138
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:17,711
'Cause you're far from it.

139
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:21,048
If anything, you should
be begging to work for me.

140
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,983
[DOFLAMINGO]
Heh. Well then,

141
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,552
and here I thought
you'd been humbled by prison.

142
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:29,690
But not even Impel Down
could make a dent in you.

143
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,226
Damn straight.
I've heard enough talk.

144
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,929
Sables!

145
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,631
Get lost! You jackal!

146
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,243
I assumed you
could be reasoned with,

147
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,444
but I was obviously mistaken.

148
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,416
These dumb jarheads
don't notice you

149
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,918
if you don't try to fight 'em.

150
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,487
We can just breeze through!

151
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:04,424
[laughing]

152
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,592
[BUGGY]
Hm?

153
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,093
[BUGGY screaming]

154
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,929
[BUGGY]
Th-That's not a breeze!

155
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:11,131
[PRISONER AA]
Captain Buggy!

156
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:14,968
Whoa! He literally got sucked
into someone else's fight!

157
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:20,073
Are you gonna move,
or do I have to make you?

158
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,108
What'll it be?

159
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,743
[HANCOCK]
You're welcome to try,

160
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:26,380
but you will perish before I
let you touch my future husband.

161
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,082
Husband?

162
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,951
Yes, my betrothed.

163
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,588
[HANCOCK]
After the ceremony,

164
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,957
we'll embark upon an
enchanted honeymoon.

165
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,391
[gasps]

166
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,398
[HANCOCK]
Luffy, my love,

167
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,236
let us abscond into the
depths of amorous euphoria.

168
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,345
[HANCOCK]
But then, what if...

169
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,915
[LUFFY] Our bliss has
left me famished, my dear.

170
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,917
[HANCOCK] I'm afraid the
food storage is empty, darling.

171
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:07,688
[LUFFY] But the world is full
of meals waiting to be cooked.

172
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:12,426
My darling, cook for me,
so I can taste your love.

173
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,095
[HANCOCK]
Of course! Anything for you.

174
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,297
Just give me
one moment, darling.

175
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,935
[HANCOCK] I must be prepared
for this possibility.

176
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,371
Luffy's appetite
is truly voracious.

177
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:25,573
If I want to satisfy him,

178
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:28,975
I must be capable of producing
a truly colossal feast!

179
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,681
[AMAZONS]
Please, Snake Princess!

180
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:37,117
We'll be happy
to make it for you!

181
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,419
[HANCOCK]
I'll have nothing of it!

182
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:42,389
Luffy wants to savor the
labors of my love, not yours!

183
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,292
[LUFFY] Darling!
How much longer must I wait?

184
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,929
[HANCOCK panting]
Coming, my love!

185
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,565
[AMAZONS]
Such undying devotion!

186
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,233
[HANCOCK]
I'll gladly embrace any trouble

187
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:56,269
that life throws our way,
because it's worth it!

188
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,438
Anything's worth it
to be his wife!

189
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,942
"His wife"? [giggles]

190
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:05,612
What the...? I can't tell if
she wants to fight me or not.

191
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:08,415
Straw Hat! Got you!

192
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:10,750
Are you deaf,
you ridiculous fool?

193
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:13,520
The only way you're getting
past me is in a coffin!

194
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,789
Perfume Femur!

195
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:18,058
You're kidding me! Really?

196
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,262
[LUFFY grunts]

197
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:23,997
Stop now!

198
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,768
[LUFFY grunting]

199
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,708
You'll never make it
to your brother in time.

200
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,246
[LUFFY]
Damn!

201
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,681
You shall perish after all.

202
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,817
[LUFFY yelling]

203
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,771
[BUGGY] Just breezing through,
nothing strange here!

204
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:06,740
[MIHAWK] There's no denying his
fighting skills have improved,

205
00:15:06,774 --> 00:15:08,743
but I've already
seen all his moves.

206
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:10,577
There's no chance
that I'll miss again.

207
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,112
Not from such a close distance.

208
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,448
[LUFFY yelling]

209
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:16,750
[BUGGY] Don't mind me!
Just passing through!

210
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:18,952
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

211
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,587
Oh! Nice save!

212
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,856
[BUGGY screams]

213
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,092
...Jet Human Shield!

214
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:29,296
Hey! What's wrong
with you?! I'll die!

215
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,565
What? I didn't slice you!

216
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,233
Besides, I just heard you say,

217
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,235
"Don't mind me,
I'm here to save you!"

218
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,439
There is no way your hearing
is that selfishly selective!

219
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,909
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum... Human Shield!

220
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,176
[BUGGY]
Cut it out!

221
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,412
[BUGGY yelling]

222
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,248
[MIHAWK]
Hmm?

223
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:52,719
All right! Enough!
Your sword's not working!

224
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:56,389
Suffer the Special
Muggy Ball! And blow off!

225
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,460
Or maybe not!

226
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,363
Do you wanna hear
a joke instead?

227
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:05,298
How's the Muggy Ball like
a robust financial market?

228
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,600
[MR. 3]
I don't know, how is it?

229
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:09,203
[BUGGY] Say it together
everyone. Because it goes...

230
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,839
[BUGGY, PRISONERS]
...boom!

231
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:13,707
[MR. 3] I've never
heard that one before!

232
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:14,675
[PRISONER BB]
Nice, Captain Buggy!

233
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,343
[PRISONER CC]
Good one!

234
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,445
[LUFFY]
Thank you, Buggy!

235
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:20,747
See you in the
afterlife, I guess!

236
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,415
We're not done!

237
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,451
[LUFFY yells]

238
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:29,356
Vista!

239
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,692
Pops said to make sure Ace's
brother doesn't get killed!

240
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:33,460
Now go! Back him up!

241
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,129
Certainly! I shall make haste!

242
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:38,298
[LUFFY screaming]

243
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,405
We meet at last.

244
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:48,575
Your reputation precedes you,
Flower Sword Vista.

245
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:52,012
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

246
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,748
I'm thrilled you've heard of me.

247
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,417
[MIHAWK]
You can drop the false modesty.

248
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,354
[LUFFY grunts]

249
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,156
Ah, well that sucked!

250
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,458
That mustache guy, who is he?

251
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,027
[MIHAWK]
I see Straw Hat's true strength.

252
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,429
[LUFFY]
Well, thanks, whoever you are!

253
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:16,303
[LUFFY panting]

254
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:34,855
[MIHAWK] It's nothing
to do with physical strength.

255
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,391
His power is to
rally those around him.

256
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:40,561
[LUFFY panting]

257
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:43,463
That's the spirit,
Straw Boy! Keep running!

258
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,365
[LUFFY panting]

259
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,467
Least he got past Mihawk.

260
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,573
Luffy! Save your brother,
you can do it!

261
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:55,576
[MARINES grunting]

262
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,444
[LUFFY]
Outta my way!

263
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:01,648
[MIHAWK] Of all the people
seeking to conquer the sea...

264
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,017
[LUFFY panting]

265
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:08,788
[MIHAWK] ...he may possess
the greatest talent of all!

266
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,692
Ace!

267
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:15,495
[BUGGY, MR. 3, PRISONERS
yelling]

268
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:20,801
That--That damn Straw Hat!

269
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:22,603
You'll pay for this!

270
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:25,673
Once again, you've proven
how amazing you are!

271
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,674
You let Hawk-Eye
think he'd beaten you,

272
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,511
but in reality, you got
exactly what you wanted!

273
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,712
Huh? What do you mean?

274
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:35,482
Don't be so coy.
Ya did it, Captain!

275
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,353
[BUGGY]
A Video Transponder Snail?!

276
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:42,589
Uh, yeah! That w-was
definitely my plan.

277
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,758
But did you expect
anything less from the man

278
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:48,128
who's gonna rule
the world? [laughs]

279
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:51,531
[PRISONER D] I'll follow you to
the end of time, Captain Buggy!

280
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:54,034
[BUGGY]
Shh.

281
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:55,735
[PRISONERS whispering]
Yeah.

282
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:59,172
Now, this is where
the important part starts.

283
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:02,809
I wish that the universe
would stop encouraging him.

284
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:07,714
[NARRATOR] In the looming shadow
of Ace's impending execution,

285
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:11,818
the world has been rocked
by one revelation after another.

286
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,693
[NARRATOR] It all began
when more than 200 inmates

287
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:23,197
managed to escape from the
iron-tight prison of Impel Down,

288
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,099
and the most notorious
of those prisoners

289
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:28,635
have now taken a lead role
in this epic battle.

290
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,240
[NARRATOR]
The blood soaked expanse

291
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:37,011
of the ghastly battlefield
is an unearthly sight.

292
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:39,045
And with a single
glance at its horrors,

293
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,716
it's clear that this
showdown will change history.

294
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:54,260
[NARRATOR] The populace
of the world has no choice

295
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,964
but to helplessly observe
the events of this war with the

296
00:19:56,997 --> 00:20:00,934
knowledge that its outcome will
determine their very future.

297
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,580
[MARINE FF] Fleet Admiral,
everything has been arranged.

298
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,682
[SENGOKU] The bay is
fully prepared as well.

299
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,450
[MARINE FF]
Yes, sir, we're all set.

300
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:21,688
[CROWD murmuring]

301
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,390
[MAN C]
What?

302
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,560
They're already
preparing for the execution?

303
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,262
[WALLEM]
Those bastards!

304
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,430
They're pushing up
the schedule, are they?

305
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,433
Damn! We don't have much time!

306
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:35,502
[CROWD murmuring]

307
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,738
[MAN A] Hold on. Is it
really about to happen?

308
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,273
[MAN B]
That's ridiculous!

309
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:40,507
Why would they announce the time

310
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,776
and then change it
at the last minute?

311
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:43,944
Cut the feed!

312
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:47,347
Kill every single video
broadcast outta this place!

313
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:50,117
As representatives of the Navy
and the World Government,

314
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,520
we're fighting to
preserve the righteous cause

315
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:55,890
of absolute justice,
and we must prevail.

316
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,292
Even if that means
stepping over the line.

317
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:01,995
But it's too much for this
naive world to understand,

318
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,931
let alone see.

319
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:06,300
There's no reason to
submit innocent citizens

320
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,035
to the horrific imagery
about to unfold.

321
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:12,372
[MARCO]
Pops...

322
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,077
[PIRATE AA]
Run faster!

323
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,579
Dammit, looks like
they really are

324
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,647
gonna execute Ace ahead of time!

325
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:24,584
[LUFFY]
Ace!

326
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:25,652
[SENGOKU]
The only news that

327
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:28,922
should spread throughout
the world after this war

328
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,891
is of our victory.

329
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:33,126
And the details are irrelevant!

330
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,967
[PIRATE D] Huh? They're
attacking our ships!

331
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,539
[PIRATES gasping]

332
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:47,741
[PIRATE BB]
Look at the bay head!

333
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,709
There's something out there!

334
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:00,855
[PALMS] Pretty sure
they're not on our side!

335
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:02,489
The Navy must've found a way

336
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:05,258
to get some reinforcements
around the ice wall somehow!

337
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:08,796
But are they admirals? I mean,
these guys are blowing up ships!

338
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,630
Shouldn't they be up front?

339
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,368
[PIRATE CC]
Is that...?

340
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,106
[PIRATE DD]
What--What the hell are they?

341
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:23,777
Of course. I wondered
when I'd get a glimpse

342
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:25,912
of the Government's
human weapons.

343
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,023
It's that big bear guy,
or I guess I mean guys.

344
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:37,591
There're so many!

345
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,398
[IVANKOV]
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

346
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:46,099
I'm confused.

347
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:48,402
[NARRATOR] A mere hour
and a half has passed since

348
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:52,906
the war began, but the Navy
aims to end it in one strike.

349
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:55,242
With this critical push,
the tide of the war

350
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:59,613
has once again changed course,
flowing into its final stage.

351
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,918
I'm tired of waiting!

352
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:06,720
Let's get this done!

353
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:09,256
Go out there and make me proud!

354
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:17,164
[NARRATOR] The Whitebeard
Pirates and Navy forces

355
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:20,167
appear to be in a deadlock, as
powerful fighters from each side

356
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,802
clash again and again.

357
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:23,870
However, when an army
of human weapons

358
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,305
encircle the battlefield,

359
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:27,708
Luffy and his allies find
themselves overwhelmed

360
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,776
by their explosive attacks.

361
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,445
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

362
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:33,981
"The Extermination
Strategy in Action!

363
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:36,316
The Power of the Pacifistas!"

364
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:39,085
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
