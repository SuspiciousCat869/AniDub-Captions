WEBVTT

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.871
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:07.907
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.643
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:13.046
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.314
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.415
You can have it!

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.151
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.487
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.523
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:26.259
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:38.758
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:41.594
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:46.766
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.002
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:50.670
to ever chart these
waters and learn

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.605
all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.574
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.976
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.479
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:03.616
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D.
Luffy, a boy whose body

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.952
became rubber after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.589
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:13.693
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:17.964
[NARRATOR]
It's been two years since

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:19.866
the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.868
Scattered across the world,
Luffy and his crew

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:23.503
underwent special
training to prepare

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:24.771
for the trials ahead.

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:26.773
Now, thousands of feet
below sea level,

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:28.942
they set sail to the next
step in their journey:

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:30.376
Fishman Island.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.178
Only by passing
through its waters

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.514
may they reach the New World.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:41.554
Guys! Check it out! Over there!

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:43.389
I think we made it!

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.959
Fishman Island!

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:48.361
It's huge!

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:50.463
[NAMI]
It's in a giant bubble!

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:52.632
It looks like they have clouds!

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:54.200
There must be air inside.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.068
[CHOPPER]
Whoa, does that mean

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:56.970
we're 10,000 meters deep now?

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:59.105
It's not as scary as I thought.

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:08.848
[LUFFY laughs]
All right! We made it!

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:12.518
Guys! We got company!

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.155
[roars]

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.825
Well, crap. That's not good.

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:21.027
[NAMI]
Sea monsters! Giant ones!

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.528
[ALL scream]

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:26.065
So, close! And now we're dead!

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:31.771
[LUFFY] Wow, they look
tough! I want one!

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:37.477
[LUFFY]
Wait, is somebody riding 'em?

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.881
[LUFFY]
"Landing at the Fishman Island!

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:44.250
Beautiful Mermaids!"

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.622
Why would you allow
these foolish humans

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:51.891
to tell you what to do, Kraken?

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:54.394
[roars]

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.076
[STRAW HATS yelp]

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.945
What the heck, Surume?

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.548
Seriously, we were almost there!

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:17.050
Forget about all that!

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:20.119
Just hang on! Don't
fall off the ship!

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.487
My eyes!

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:25.258
Mine, too! And I
don't even have any!

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.409
[STRAW HATS sigh]

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:48.081
[panting]

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:49.615
[USOPP gasps]

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:05.832
[USOPP yells] Whoa, it's like a
whole circus of sea monsters!

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:08.634
[HAMMOND] You guys are the
Straw Hat Pirates, aren't you?

00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:10.336
So what if we are, pal?

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.107
Maybe you better tell us
who you are first!

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.476
[HAMMOND]
You have quite the reputation.

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.611
For starters, you were the ones

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:21.781
who ruined the
Arlong Pirates' plans.

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.616
[gasps]

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:27.053
[HAMMOND]
That part makes sense at least.

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:29.455
But for some reason,
two years back,

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:33.393
when Hachi was in trouble,
you stood up for your old enemy.

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:36.062
And then, you clocked one
of the Celestial Dragons

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:39.065
right in his ugly face.

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:40.500
Fisher Tiger happened to do

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.802
the exact same thing
and he's the hero

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:45.071
of this entire island.

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:50.009
Fisher Tiger?

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:55.181
[chuckles] I'm not sure
what to do with you.

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:56.649
Tell it to me straight.

00:06:56.682 --> 00:07:01.421
Are you supposed to be
our enemies or not?

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:03.656
How about I give you an option?

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:05.525
Enlist under our
banner as members

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:08.661
of the New Fishman
Pirates or else!

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:12.064
"Or else" meaning we
sink you right now.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:15.868
What'd you say?

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:18.070
[NAMI]
Fuel up, Franky, hurry!

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.006
Huh? You got a plan?

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:21.674
You and I both know that Luffy

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:24.010
isn't gonna cooperate
with these guys.

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:26.679
But we're 10,000 meters
underwater right now and if we

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:28.848
try to fight them, we don't
stand a chance of winning,

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:31.350
especially not with
those sea monsters.

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:32.852
So, we have to go!

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:35.021
I need you to use all of
the oxygen we have to make

00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:36.789
a giant Coup de Burst
so we can charge

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:38.191
straight into Fishman Island!

00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:39.592
[BROOK, CHOPPER gasp]

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.627
Whoa, are you kiddin' me?

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:45.465
[NAMI] We've come way
too far to die here.

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:46.699
I agree.

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:50.303
It's risky, but it's likely our
only chance at surviving this.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:52.572
If that's the case, I'm gonna
fill it up right away!

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:54.740
Franky! Steer the ship!

00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:57.443
Everything's gonna
be just super.

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:03.649
Ah. Those humans're
starting to look

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:05.651
awful busy over there to me.

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:08.788
They might be up to something,
don't you think?

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.891
[HAMMOND]
Humans aren't that clever.

00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:14.460
Whatever it is,
we can deal with it.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.262
So, have you decided if you want

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:19.432
to be part of our crew,
Straw Hat Luffy?

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:28.107
Yeah right, you wish! Stupid!

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:33.412
Are you sure about that?

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:35.314
You did hear me say
what will happen

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.617
if you refuse, didn't you?

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.253
Guess you are the
enemy of the Fishmen!

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:43.756
Nothing but filthy human scum!

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.760
Bleh! Why would I
wanna work for a big

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:50.096
dumb fish face like you?

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:52.298
[CHOPPER] Cut it out, Luffy,
you'll make him mad!

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:54.033
That's a real shame.

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:57.603
You won't be seeing
Fishman Island after all.

00:08:57.637 --> 00:09:00.606
Get ready to sink, Straw Hats.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.941
Sea Lion!

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:05.278
[roars]

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:08.681
[USOPP grunts] All right,
filled up and ready to move!

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.116
Franky! You're up!

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:11.050
Roger!

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.852
[roaring, growling]

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:14.687
[HAMMOND]
Take them down!

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.322
Bring it on!

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:21.961
[growling]

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:23.996
Franky, let's go!

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.300
Hey, don't forget,
we got our own lion!

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:30.503
Maybe we can fight some
other time, all right?

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:34.840
Here goes. Coup de Burst!

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:40.079
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.881
Look at 'em go!

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.256
[ALL yell]

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:52.925
Can't breathe.
There's no more air.

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:56.262
[grunts] We're getting squished.

00:09:56.295 --> 00:09:59.932
[BROOK gasps] It's hard to
breathe, and that's not

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:03.436
just because I don't have lungs.

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:06.872
Hang on! We'll make it,
no matter what!

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:10.910
What in the hell?

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:12.878
What's up with that crazy ship?

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:15.014
We're on our way in!

00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:18.384
I'll be with you soon,
beautiful mermaids!

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:24.857
[BOTH gasp]

[STRAW HATS scream]

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:27.560
[LUFFY]
We lost the coating!

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:30.463
It got stuck when we
crossed the bubble!

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:36.535
[gasps] Look up there!
What could it be?

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:40.973
[gasps] This bubble.
It's a double structure!

00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:45.077
A normal ship would crash
because there's nothing but air!

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:47.647
We're about to run
into another bubble!

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.649
You guys ready?

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:51.584
[GROUP gasping]

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.424
Water?

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.639
[NAMI]
This current is really strong!

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.645
[CHOPPER]
Help... me...

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.981
[BROOK]
Can't breathe.

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:25.818
[SANJI]
Crap. Four of us can't swim.

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:39.365
[ZORO]
Come on. Reach!

00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:45.004
[SANJI]
Nami! Robin!

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:50.910
[SANJI] Dammit. I can't
resist the current!

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.493
[HAMMOND]
That's one way to get in.

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:09.328
Pretty reckless though.

00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:11.030
Well, we can still
go in after them

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:12.798
if you want to, Hammond.

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:16.969
No way to know if they're
alive or dead though. Psh.

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:18.571
Yeah, let's track them down.

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.673
We can't let Neptune's
Army get their hands

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:22.675
on them first, now can we?

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:24.143
But before we do anything,

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:27.580
we should go back to Noah
and tell the boss what's up.

00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:29.548
I think he'd want
to know that the man

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:32.785
who ruined Arlong's
plan is here.

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:49.368
[ICHIKA]
Hey!

00:12:52.204 --> 00:12:53.272
Take a look!

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:54.073
I'll look.

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:55.207
I won't!

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:56.509
Maybe I'll look.

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.277
Who cares if I look?

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:01.680
Now he's moving!

00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:02.681
He moved!

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:04.183
No, he didn't!

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:06.085
He might've moved.

00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:07.787
Who cares if he moved?

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.554
[coughs]

00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:10.389

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.058
[laughs]

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.028
All right! He's alive!

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:17.897
Thank goodness!

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:24.470
Where am I?

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:27.540
[CAMIE]
Oh, Luffy- <i>chin</i> !

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:30.409
It's been a while, hasn't it?

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:32.511
So, how are you feeling?

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:37.716
Ah!

00:13:56.268 --> 00:13:57.703
Ah!

00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:02.808
Hah! Hey, it's Camie!
It's nice to see you!

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.744
Oh, Camie, you've
gotten so lovely!

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:07.479
Marry me!

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:09.682
It's been two
whole years, huh?

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:12.351
You haven't change a bit!

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:14.987
Wait a minute. If Camie's here,

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.690
then we made it to
Fishman Island after all?

00:14:17.723 --> 00:14:18.824
Yeah, we did!

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.993
From what I understand,
we were about to drown,

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:23.362
but then we were rescued
by a bunch of mermaids!

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:24.496
That's right!

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.166
Sanji, Chopper, and I just
woke up a few minutes ago.

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:28.667
Guess we're pretty lucky, huh?

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.936
Lucky enough to wake up
in Camie's house.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.071
Here catch.

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:34.340
Oh. So, this is your house?

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:36.508
[CAMIE]
My bad! I know I was supposed

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:39.011
to pick you guys up on
Sabaody, but I was thinking

00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:41.080
that was another month from now.

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:44.850
Heh. That's okay!
Where is everybody?

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:49.388
Well uh. Looks like
we got separated.

00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:51.757
Goodness. I hope they're safe.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.259
So, they're lost?

00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:54.927
Yeah. Before I blacked out,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.962
I was trying to follow
them, but that current

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:59.298
must've pulled them off
in a different direction.

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:00.699
Ah, gotcha.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.701
Well, I'm sure it'll
turn out okay, right!

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:03.802
They're fine.

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:06.272
The bonehead can't
do much underwater,

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:08.941
but the robot and Moss Head
are probably with him.

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:10.042
So, I wouldn't worry.

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:12.878
Right, everything'll
be just fine!

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:15.547
[CAMIE] I hope I get
to see them again soon.

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.049
Anyway, here you go!

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:18.651
I'm sure you're all freezing.

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:21.053
So, I made some soup
that'll warm you right up.

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:22.554
[GROUP cheers]

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:23.789
[CAMIE]
Ta-dah!

00:15:23.822 --> 00:15:26.926
Cold seaweed soup! It's yummy!

00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:32.398
[USOPP]
It's cold?

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:35.401
[CAMIE]
Mm-hm!

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:36.435
[screams]

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:38.070
That's not right,
how are you supposed

00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:41.240
to get warm if the soup
is cold? I'm sorry!

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:42.741
Wha...?

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.944
I'm such a failure!

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:47.413
[BOTH screaming]

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:50.983
But your soup is great, Camie.

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:53.686
I'm warmer already!

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:55.587
[CHOPPER]
That doesn't make sense.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.856
Come on, let me try some, too!

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.694
Your clothes are dry, everybody!

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:02.594
They're dry!

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.196
No, they're not dry!

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:05.698
Your clothes might be dry.

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:07.833
Who cares if they're dry?

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.438
Ah!

00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:14.473
[LUFFY] You took care
of our clothes, too?

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:15.774
Wow, thanks!

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.343
[laughs]

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:19.445
[LUFFY]
Who are those little guys?

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:21.480
[CAMIE] Oh, they're
some friends of mine.

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:22.982
The Medaka Mermaid Quintuplets.

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:23.983
I'm Ichika!

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:24.883
I'm Nika!

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:25.884
I'm Sanka!

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:26.885
I'm Yonka!

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.620
And I'm Yonka Two!

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.956
[USOPP]
Wait, why are there two Yonkas?

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.625
They're really fast swimmers,
and pretty clever as well!

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:35.828
Yeah? Nice to meet ya!

00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:38.497
I've got a lot of neat
friends here, actually.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.699
This is the sea floor
of the Mermaid Cove,

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:43.002
home to the girls' dorm
of the famous Mermaid Café!

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:45.404
[SANJI]
Huh?

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:50.142
G... G... G... The Girls' dorm?

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.745
[BOTH gasp]
Uh-oh!

00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:53.979
Please, Camie!

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:57.249
Tell me everything about
this Mermaid Café place!

00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:59.018
Oh, it's just this
cute little café

00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:00.486
where I work as a waitress.

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:02.855
We have a lot of pretty
mermaids there on staff.

00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:06.025
Ah! Sounds like heaven!

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.529
Can I get you anything extra?

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:13.832
Sanji!

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.634
Don't die!

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:18.670
I won't die!

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:20.339
[USOPP, CHOPPER]
False alarm!

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:24.009
I swore. I made
a promise to myself,

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:27.846
that for the entire time
I was on Fishman Island

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.050
I wouldn't get a
nosebleed and pass out!

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:35.387
[SANJI]
And I've held out for this long,

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:38.357
so I deserve a reward, right?

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.692
Pathetic.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.295
[CAMIE] I know! Why don't
we go up there now?

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:46.165
I'll introduce you
to all of my friends!

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.702
[LUFFY]
Whoa! A turtle!

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:53.238
[CHOPPER]
"Sea Turtle Elevator," huh?

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.042
[CAMIE] Could you give
us a lift, Mr. Turtle?

00:17:57.076 --> 00:18:00.579
[whistle blows]

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:04.817
[CAMIE] This is a coral
apartment complex.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.586
The dorms are at the very
bottom, so rent's cheap.

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:09.254
The top floor's
the most expensive

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:11.056
because it gets natural light.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.892
[LUFFY] Mm... Does that
mean you're poor?

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:16.295
And what about
Hachi and Pappagu?

00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:19.231
[CAMIE] Hatchin got beat up
real bad about a year ago.

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:20.833
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.

00:18:20.866 --> 00:18:23.902
He was protecting the Sunny
for us back on Sabaody, right?

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.737
Hatchin came from
the Fishman District,

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.806
so that's where he's been
resting and recovering.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.508
I haven't had the chance
to see him lately,

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:31.777
but from what I hear, he's
getting better all the time.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.246
Huh? He's okay?

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:36.815
Yeah. but it's kind of
a rough part of town.

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:38.750
If you guys go along
with me, I wouldn't mind

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.185
heading over there
to visit him, though.

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:41.286
[LUFFY]
Let's do it!

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.589
I've been wanting to
thank him face-to-face.

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:45.424
Sure, you got it!

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:49.027
And, well, as for Pappagu...

00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:51.597
He's a super-famous
fashion designer.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.465
So, he lives in a
big fancy mansion

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:57.336
in the high-class district
of Fishverly Hills!

00:18:57.369 --> 00:18:59.104
I'm supposed to
deliver some clams

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:00.973
over there today.
You wanna come with me?

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:02.941
Wait, he's your pet.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:05.043
But you two don't live
in the same place?

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:08.147
[giggles] Yeah, 'cause
that area's a little

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.948
out of my price range.

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.718
We have better
clams here, anyway.

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:14.786
[CHOPPER]
We're almost to the top!

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.222
Huh? Hey, what's that
drinking-straw

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:18.524
looking tube dealie?

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:21.793
Oh. That thing?
That's the Water Road.

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.462
The bubble craftsmen built it.

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.631
And when mermaids or
fish get inside it...

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:29.034
Well, hold on.
Here, let me show you.

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.640
Wow look!

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:35.641
So, cool!

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:39.044
Camie! Don't go!

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.550
It's the surface! We made it!

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.919
Luffy- <i>chin</i> !

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:52.090
[CAMIE]
Look! I'm swimming in the sky!

00:19:52.124 --> 00:19:55.360
--[GROUP] Whoa!
--[LUFFY] I wanna do that!

00:19:55.394 --> 00:19:56.562
Wait a sec!

00:19:56.595 --> 00:20:00.199
If we're underwater, why do
I see a sky full of clouds?

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:04.102
No way! I don't get it,
but it sure is neat!

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:06.004
Hey! Camie!

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.040
[SANJI]
Huh? It's a girl!

00:20:08.073 --> 00:20:09.541
Where's that coming from?

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.877
[gasps] Hey, guys!

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.845
[SANJI, LUFFY]
Huh?

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.014
Whoa.

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.683
Are these your pirate friends?

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:20.586
I guess that means they
didn't drown after all!

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:22.454
[SANJI whimpers]

00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:24.089
You didn't come in
through the entrance

00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:26.191
like you're supposed to,
so we were concerned.

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:28.694
[SANJI whimpering]

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:29.795
Well, hi there.

00:20:29.828 --> 00:20:31.897
You're not as scary
as I thought you'd be.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.465
So, you broke in?

00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:36.401
That's pretty hot. I kinda
have a thing for pirates.

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:39.238
[SANJI stammering]

00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:43.375
[gasps]

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:44.443
[laughs]

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:48.714
[laughs] It's like a
real-life fairy tale!

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:53.185
A coral paradise! A whole
cove full of mermaids!

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:06.732
[sobs]

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:08.000
[GROUP gasps]

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:09.935
What's the matter
with Sanji now?

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:13.505
He didn't even cry this hard
when he left the Baratie.

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.910
Finally!

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:22.648
I found my All Blue
after all these years!

00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:28.086
Are you sure about that? Really?

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.522
Here, let me
introduce everybody!

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:32.624
That's Luffy- <i>chin</i> ,
he's the captain!

00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:34.960
Yeah, nice to meet ya!

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:36.962
[CAMIE]
Sanji- <i>chin</i> 's the crybaby.

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:39.264
The nose guy is Usopp- <i>chin</i> !

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:40.465
That's me!

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:42.768
[CAMIE] And the raccoon
is Chopper- <i>chin</i> !

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:44.036
Not again!

00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:45.103
[SANJI whimpering]

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:49.041
[MERMAID 527A]
Aw, why are you crying?

00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:50.008
Come over here.

00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:52.144
Let's dance in
the water together!

00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:55.147
[yells]

00:21:57.416 --> 00:21:59.651
Okay. I get it.

00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:02.621
This is obviously
too good to be true.

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:05.357
Maybe... I'm destined
to die today.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:06.625
That's dark!

00:22:06.658 --> 00:22:07.793
What the heck happened to you

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:10.295
in the last two years
to make you this gloomy?

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:13.065
Isn't this supposed to be
the land of your dreams?

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:17.336
[LUFFY laughs]
You crack me up, Sanji!

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:19.438
[USOPP, CHOPPER]
I don't think he's joking!

00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:51.336
Interesting.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.207
So, Straw Hat finally
made it to our turf, did he?

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.007
Good for him.

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:58.343
[gasps] Right.

00:22:58.377 --> 00:23:01.246
Wh-What are we gonna
do about it, Boss?

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:08.987
[HORDY] I want you to bring
him here, and quickly.

00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:16.094
[NARRATOR] After a safe,
if explosive, arrival

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:18.397
on Fishman Island, the
Straw Hats make thier way

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.400
to Mermaid's Cove, where
they recieve a warm welcome.

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:23.535
Unfortunately, the three
princes of the island

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:25.704
don't seem as cordial
as the mermaids,

00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:27.572
and the Straw Hats
are forced to hide.

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:30.041
Then, just when it seems
like danger is passing,

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:33.211
Sanji is struck with a
shocking medical emergency.

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:34.780
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:38.316
"Excitement Blow-out!
Sanji's Life Under Threat!"

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.919
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
