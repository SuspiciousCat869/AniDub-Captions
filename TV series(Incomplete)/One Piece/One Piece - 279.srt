1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,771
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,407
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,175
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:11,478
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,746
You want my treasure?

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:13,847
You can have it!

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,051
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:20,253
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,158
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,427
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,663
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,479
Sniper King.

13
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,315
Hm?

14
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:57,217
Shoot down that flag.

15
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,752
Roger.

16
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,191
This my new weapon, a massive
slingshot by the name of Kabuto!

17
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,393
Behold its awesome power!

18
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:10,463
Special Attack Firebird Star!

19
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,407
No way.

20
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,446
Mission complete.

21
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,214
You're all going to die!

22
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:31,051
You morons can't challenge the
entire world and expect to win!

23
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:36,122
Yeah? Bring it on!

24
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:45,465
Robin! There's still something
I want to hear you say!

25
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:54,007
Tell me you wanna live!

26
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,744
Robin.

27
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,450
Robin.

28
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,753
I can live?

29
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:12,659
I never dared to wish
for something like that.

30
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,031
The world had
denied me that hope.

31
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:22,536
The sea's a vast
place so I guarantee--

32
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,273
Someday you'll find friends
who won't ever leave you!

33
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:41,688
But now, if I'm allowed to
say my wish, just this once.

34
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,591
Then I--

35
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:50,664
I want to live!
Take me with you!

36
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,433
Take me away from here!

37
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:20,193
You guys! You're so
awesome! I love you!

38
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:26,367
Let's go!

39
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,168
Look! The drawbridge
is lowering!

40
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,338
Our reinforcements pulled
it together after all.

41
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,440
And just in time, too.

42
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:38,212
Hey, Robin! We'll save you!
No matter what!

43
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:42,583
That got it! Go, Straw Hat!
The rest is up to you!

44
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,685
Damn you, pirate scum!

45
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,487
We'll never let you through!

46
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,255
Prepare the mortar cannon!

47
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,258
Don't let 'em cross the bridge,
even if you have to destroy it!

48
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,525
Yes, sir!

49
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,570
What happened? Why'd it stop?

50
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:03,804
Damn those marines!

51
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:08,074
They really piss me off!
Stop getting in the way!

52
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,212
Hey! Straw Hats! Listen up!

53
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,315
Huh? Granny Kokoro?

54
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:15,616
I heard everything.

55
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,484
Why are you all
just standing around?

56
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,819
We're not "standing around"!

57
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,821
The bridge broke -
there's no way over!

58
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,089
Jump into the waterfall!

59
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:25,091
Give it all you've got!
Trust me!

60
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,594
Look, it's the sea train!

61
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:32,098
Hey. What's up with
that devious chuckle?

62
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,043
Let's go!

63
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,457
I wouldn't take
you with me anyway.

64
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,159
You'll never
make it as a pirate.

65
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,229
No! I will make it as a pirate!

66
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,832
Someday, I'm gonna gather
a crew even better than yours

67
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,668
and I'm gonna find the greatest
treasure in the world,

68
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,570
and then I'll be
King of the Pirates!

69
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,504
I'll show you!

70
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,309
When I was little, I made
an oath to gather a crew

71
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,611
and become King of the Pirates.

72
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:21,014
It was a promise I made
to the man who protected me.

73
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,350
Robin.

74
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,319
You're not only
a part of my crew.

75
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,654
You're my friend.

76
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:30,324
I'll protect you,
just like he protected me.

77
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:33,426
I swear. I'll always be there!

78
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,702
"Jump Towards the Falls!
Luffy's Feelings!"

79
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,554
Hey!

80
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,423
You gotta take me with you on
your next adventure, Shanks!

81
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,658
I wanna be a pirate,
just like you!

82
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,395
Right. As if you could
ever be a pirate!

83
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,196
Why couldn't I?

84
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,399
Look.

85
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,567
You might be a
good swimmer and all,

86
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,437
but that doesn't mean you'd
make a good pirate, Luffy.

87
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,138
But I'm a great fighter, too!

88
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,708
My punches are like two pistols!

89
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:21,408
Are they now?

90
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,210
What's that supposed to mean?

91
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,779
He means that you're
too much of a kid, kid!

92
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,047
And he's right, you know.

93
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,482
I got boys older than you.

94
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:31,218
I'm not a kid! I'm a grown up!

95
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,553
Here, have some
juice and calm down.

96
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,356
Wow! Thanks, Shanks!

97
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,760
I don't know one
pirate who drinks juice!

98
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,561
Hey! You tricked me!

99
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,132
Stop laughing!

100
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,167
That was a cheap shot!

101
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,247
Excuse us.

102
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:08,088
So these are what pass for
pirates around these parts.

103
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:10,624
Looks rather sad to me.

104
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,497
Welcome, gentlemen.

105
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,064
What can I do for you?

106
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,301
We're mountain bandits,

107
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,704
but we didn't come to
tear your place apart.

108
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,306
All we want is some sake.

109
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,541
I'd say ten barrels should do.

110
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:31,145
I'm sorry, but actually we're
fresh out of sake right now.

111
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,682
Interesting. These other
pirates seem to be drinking.

112
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,550
Is that water in their glasses?

113
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:40,053
No. That just happens to be the
last of what I had stocked up.

114
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,256
My apologies, gentlemen.

115
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,426
Looks like me and my friends
drank the whole place dry.

116
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,362
But, you can have
this if you want.

117
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,097
It hasn't even been
open yet. Go ahead.

118
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,306
I'm wanted.

119
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,709
There's an eight million
berry bounty on my head.

120
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:06,446
One bottle isn't enough for a
nightcap. So don't insult me.

121
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:11,785
Just great. Now the floor's wet.

122
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,554
Sorry about that, Makino.

123
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,589
You got a rag I can
clean this up with?

124
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:19,092
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

125
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,233
Since you like to clean things

126
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,402
so much maybe you'll find
this mess more fulfilling.

127
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,807
A place with no sake is a
place not worth our time, men.

128
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,675
Let's get out of here.

129
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,578
See you later, pansies.

130
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,458
Captain, are you okay?
Are you hurt?

131
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:54,327
Not a problem in
the world, Makino.

132
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,534
That fella really
got you good, boss!

133
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,435
Talk about a loser!

134
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,740
Why are you all laughing?

135
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,442
What's so funny?

136
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,744
You should have
fought back, Shanks!

137
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,479
It doesn't matter
how strong they look

138
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,214
or how many of them there are,

139
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:18,151
if you just laugh it off,
you're not a man, or a pirate!

140
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,689
Look, Luffy,
I know how you feel,

141
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:24,258
but the guy just
spilled some booze on me.

142
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,293
It's not worth getting
bent out of shape.

143
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,295
Whatever!

144
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,705
You shouldn't eat out
of frustration, Luffy.

145
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,005
Shut up!

146
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,744
Wait! What are you eating?

147
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:44,945
No! You didn't!

148
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,647
Don't tell me you ate the
fruit that was inside that box?

149
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,653
Spit it out right now!
Every single bit!

150
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:56,323
What are you doing?
Why are you shaking me?

151
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,400
What's going on?

152
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,502
Luffy, you just ate
the Gum-Gum Fruit.

153
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,371
Part of a group
called the Devil Fruits.

154
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,640
Eating any of them takes
away your ability to swim

155
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:13,707
for the rest of your life,

156
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,677
but the one you ate also
turns your body to rubber!

157
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,413
No way! It can't!

158
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,715
You dumbass!

159
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,733
What is this?

160
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:44,070
We were drinking and having a
nice time, until you showed up.

161
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,240
You apologize!

162
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,608
No one messes
with Shanks's crew!

163
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,746
I don't think I said anything
to offend you directly.

164
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,150
You think wrong! Now apologize!

165
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,651
Mayor! Help me!

166
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,458
Did you see the looks
on those pirates' faces?

167
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:08,295
Yeah! They got doused in liquor
and didn't even say a word.

168
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,262
How pathetic.

169
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:12,166
Pirates are a bunch
of wimps, nothing more.

170
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,734
They're all talk, no action.

171
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,268
Stop it!

172
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,139
Stop making fun of Shanks
and his men right now!

173
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,474
They're not wimps at all!

174
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,741
Luffy, no!

175
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:27,214
You better stop right now,
you stupid bandits!

176
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,587
You should watch
your flapping gums, kid.

177
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,589
No one who's ever
made me mad has lived

178
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,692
to tell the horrifying
and painful tale.

179
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,327
Wait! Hold on!

180
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:43,396
Let the boy go! I beg you!

181
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,200
I don't know what he's done,

182
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,736
and I certainly don't
intend to fight you over it.

183
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,639
If you'll accept, I'll
even pay you to stop this.

184
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:54,775
Just spare the poor
boy's life, please!

185
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,343
Mayor!

186
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,712
While the oldest
generation may know the way

187
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,714
of the world better than us all.

188
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:03,751
I'm sorry, but this rotten
kid's already made me angry.

189
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,619
Nothing can save him now.

190
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,456
You're the rotten
ones around here!

191
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,127
And you're a lost cause.

192
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,496
Which you can
regret in the next life.

193
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,196
No!

194
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,431
Please, you have to let him go!

195
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:23,170
I was wondering why the bar
was empty on such a fine day.

196
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,138
So, it's the
mountain bandits again.

197
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,340
Captain Shanks!

198
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,079
Shanks!

199
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,573
Pirates. You're just
now showing your heads?

200
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,309
Have you been spending all
this time scrubbing the village?

201
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,212
Luffy! Didn't you say
earlier that your punches

202
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,413
were stronger than pistols?

203
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,315
Shut your mouth!

204
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,751
Listen. I don't know what
you think you're doing here,

205
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,553
but you might wanna leave.

206
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,455
You wouldn't want
something bad to happen.

207
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:17,458
And I have just the man
to deliver this message.

208
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:20,227
I'll blow your
head off if I have to.

209
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,062
But that's up to you, my friend.

210
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,004
Would you risk your life?

211
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:33,741
Now that' you've
drawn your pistol,

212
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:35,409
are you willing to use it?

213
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,611
What the hell are
you talking about?

214
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:41,481
I'm saying that guns aren't for
threats. They're for actions.

215
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,097
You! You're a dead man!

216
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,565
These guys fight dirty!

217
00:14:58,598 --> 00:14:59,499
Dirty?

218
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,435
Who did you think
you were dealing with?

219
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,771
We never claimed to
be saints or anything.

220
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:07,074
You fellas are staring
down a crew of pirates.

221
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:10,277
Shut up! We just
want the boy! Not you!

222
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:11,612
Listen up bandits.

223
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:15,182
Whether I'm sprayed with
alcohol or doused with food.

224
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,650
Hell, even if I'm spit on,

225
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,820
most of the time I'll just laugh
it off and forget about it.

226
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,089
But if you hurt
a friend of mine,

227
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,624
you'll pay for it,
regardless of your reason.

228
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:28,696
Shanks.

229
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,364
So we're gonna pay?

230
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:34,000
Lousy pirates.
Kill 'em all, men!

231
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,338
I'll take care of this.
Shouldn't be a big deal.

232
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:49,616
You shouldn't get too cocky.

233
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,453
If you really wanted to fight
us, looks like a battleship

234
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:55,121
or something bigger
would have been more useful.

235
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,424
Wow.

236
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,327
Hold on, please!

237
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,129
It was the kid who attacked us!

238
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,197
I thought you were a wanted man.

239
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,702
A smokescreen!

240
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,173
Luffy?

241
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:16,076
Looks like I made
a clean getaway.

242
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,077
They'd never think to look

243
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,179
for a mountain bandit
escaping onto the ocean.

244
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,649
Dammit! Let go of me,
you dumbass idiot!

245
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:23,550
I really hope you die!

246
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,820
Yes. I know that's
what you want.

247
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,156
But you're the one dying today.

248
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,725
Remember what I said
about making me angry?

249
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,561
Dammit! Dammit!

250
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:38,298
Filthy bandit scum and
I couldn't squeeze off one hit!

251
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:51,044
Sorry, kid, but I don't seem
to have a use for you anymore.

252
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,319
What the--?
What the hell is that?

253
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,312
Shanks!

254
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,422
Get lost.

255
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,675
I'm in your debt, Luffy.

256
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,611
Makino told me everything
about how you stood up for us.

257
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:02,515
How you were willing to fight
and put yourself on the line.

258
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:07,655
You can't cry. You're a man now.

259
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:10,290
But Shanks. Your arm!

260
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,493
Your arm!

261
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:19,066
Luffy. It's just an arm.
I've got another one.

262
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,134
I'm just glad you're alright.

263
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,589
So you're leaving?

264
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:44,158
Yeah. It was a nice
extended vacation,

265
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,726
but we have to part ways now.

266
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,227
I bet you'll miss me, right?

267
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,563
Yeah. But this time's different.

268
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,765
I won't beg you
to take me with you,

269
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,368
'cause I'm gonna become
a pirate all on my own!

270
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,506
I wouldn't take
you with me anyway.

271
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,676
You'll never make
it as a pirate.

272
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:03,343
No!

273
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,312
I will make it as a pirate!

274
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:08,182
Someday, I'm gonna gather
a crew even better than yours

275
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,818
and I'm gonna find the
greatest treasure in the world,

276
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:14,622
and then I'll be King of
the Pirates! I'll show you!

277
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,490
You think you'll surpass us?

278
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,329
In that case.

279
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,100
I'll leave this hat to you.

280
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,335
It means more to me than
anything in the world,

281
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,238
so you better take good
care of it. You hear me?

282
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,824
It's been ten years
since that day.

283
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,694
I set out to sea
to become a pirate.

284
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,829
I'll protect my
friends and my crew

285
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,732
the same way that
Shanks protected me.

286
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,517
Robin! Wait for us!

287
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:34,201
Bastard!

288
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,402
That vile Chopper Man!

289
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:39,340
He will thwart my plans for
world domination no longer!

290
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:41,809
This is Dr. Usodaba:
Evil Incarnate!

291
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:43,577
He leads the evil Usodaba Gang

292
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,246
and plots to take
over the world!

293
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,314
This evil scientist
produces evil monsters,

294
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,682
evil robots, you name it!

295
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:51,051
Those are some of his
evil minions behind him.

296
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,419
Did I mention he was evil?

297
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,655
I'll lure Chopper
Man to my base.

298
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:57,324
Here, I will patiently await
his arrival, ready to strike.

299
00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:00,327
Then, I'll crush him with
my gang's full fighting power!

300
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:02,796
His weakness, and my bait,

301
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,366
will be his lovely
assistant, Namifia!

302
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:07,201
This is Namifia,
his lovely assistant!

303
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:09,670
She efficiently manages all
of Chopper Man's missions.

304
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:13,273
All right, minions!
Go out and kidnap my hostage!

305
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:17,044
Sir! Here you go, evil one!

306
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:17,678
What's up?

307
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:18,812
Why'd you bring him?

308
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:22,249
This is Chopper Man! Our
hero and champion of justice!

309
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,418
Donning his Chopper cape, he
flies around doing good deeds,

310
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,053
and fights for world peace!

311
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:28,321
His weapon is his cuteness!

312
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,291
Using the power
of his "Cute Spark",

313
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:33,160
he can render any enemy
helpless by melting their heart!

314
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:34,762
And if that doesn't work,
he uses the power

315
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,631
of his "Chopper Violence"
to beat the crap out of them!

316
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:39,466
Tea, please!

317
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:42,135
Hey! You can't relax
at my base of evil!

318
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,472
What's that big thing
out in the garden?

319
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:46,306
My secret weapon!

320
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,809
Stop peeking at
it, you little jerk!

321
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:50,244
Can I take you for a test drive?

322
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:51,245
Sure! Go ahead!

323
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:53,747
Don't make friends with
my nemesis, Luffybomber!

324
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,749
This is the giant robot
and secret weapon

325
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:56,784
known as Luffybomber!

326
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,252
It stands 50 meters tall!

327
00:21:58,285 --> 00:21:59,787
With Usodaba at the controls,

328
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,456
it becomes your worst
and strongest enemy!

329
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,158
Special Skills: It can speak!

330
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:06,660
Personality: It does
whatever it feels like!

331
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:20,641
This is the Rice Ball
Monster, Zorokiller!

332
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,443
If you don't have
rice balls, he gets mad

333
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:24,378
and says, "Make sure
you have some next time!"

334
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,247
Robiflowern, the flower monster!

335
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,348
This evil woman is defeated

336
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:30,251
by Chopper Man's "Cute Spark"
time and time again!

337
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:32,353
And, the naughty
monster, Sanjiropus!

338
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:33,320
He insists that
he isn't naughty,

339
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:35,222
but he's always thinking
about naughty stuff!

340
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:37,124
To men, he will show no mercy!

341
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:39,460
They are the Usodaba
Gang's "Evil Three"!

342
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:40,661
But, they don't
really have anything

343
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:41,762
to do with this story, so.

344
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:44,131
Conveniently enough,
this evil gang was blown away!

345
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:46,333
Whoa! That was amazing!

346
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,168
You're the coolest, Luffybomber!

347
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,536
Hell yeah, I am!

348
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:52,673
Hey, Chopper Man!

349
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,375
There's trouble in one
of the eastern towns!

350
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:55,476
Right!

351
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,544
I'll fly over there with my
giant robot Luffybomber

352
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:00,080
and see what's going on!
Where'd he go?

353
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:01,148
Oh, I sold him.

354
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:03,183
Go, go, Chopper Man!

355
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,518
Continue your noble
fight for world peace!
