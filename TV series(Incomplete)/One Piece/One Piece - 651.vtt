00:01:28.744 --> 00:01:30.247
[TEACH laughs]

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.422
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.259
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:38.463
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:42.237
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.578 --> 00:02:38.016
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.922
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:43.661
These wild and dangerous
seas are known as

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:46.199
the New World.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.270
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:50.741
to ever chart these waters
and learn all the secrets

00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:51.977
they held.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.881
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.253
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:58.423
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:03.000
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:05.470
became rubber after
eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:09.111
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:12.618
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:18.029
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:19.934
of the New World,
the Straw Hats form

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:21.637
an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.175
Their current objective is
to destroy a man-made

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:27.448
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:30.087
However, Luffy becomes
sidetracked when he finds out

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.558
that the prize at a local
fighting tournament

00:03:32.592 --> 00:03:34.729
is the Flame-Flame Fruit.

00:03:34.763 --> 00:03:37.000
I'm sick of him always
having to protect me!

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:42.144
This time, Soldier...

00:03:42.178 --> 00:03:43.446
...I'll protect you!

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.616
I promise!

00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:00.648
[REBECCA]
He won't make it this time.

00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:02.017
He'll die.

00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:04.021
Who're you talking about?

00:04:04.054 --> 00:04:07.127
[REBECCA] He's a toy soldier
with only one leg.

00:04:07.161 --> 00:04:08.196
[LUFFY]
A toy?

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.467
Oh, my, elderly gentlemen.

00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:12.638
May I offer to carry your
belongings for you?

00:04:12.672 --> 00:04:14.944
Oh, am I?

00:04:14.977 --> 00:04:17.114
Do you find me funny?

00:04:17.148 --> 00:04:18.851
You know, I met someone
like that in front of

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:20.387
the Colosseum.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.126
[REBECCA]
Yeah. It was probably him.

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.865
[INMATE C] We're not allowed to
step foot outside the arena.

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:27.434
Even if we wanted
to help your friend,

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.606
there's nothing
we can do in here.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.211
I mean is it possible
for a toy to be killed?

00:04:32.244 --> 00:04:34.816
Them being alive in the first
place still seems weird.

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.426
You're not from around here,
so it difficult to understand.

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.370
They aren't any different
from us humans.

00:04:45.403 --> 00:04:48.276
Whether it's being friends
for the friendless,

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:50.982
siblings for those
without family,

00:04:51.015 --> 00:04:54.455
or bringing love to the lonely.

00:04:54.488 --> 00:04:56.258
I don't understand why
it's against the law

00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:57.528
for them to live with us.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.167
You know,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.071
ever since the day
I lost my mother,

00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:04.274
I didn't have any
family of my own.

00:05:04.308 --> 00:05:07.782
He brought me up like
I was his own daughter.

00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:11.857
I don't think of him as a toy.
He's more like a father to me.

00:05:13.727 --> 00:05:16.031
Wow.
You two sound really close.

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:19.706
[GYATS]
Thank you for your patience!

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:21.676
The ring has been
fully repaired!

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.081
Rebecca.
The match is about to start.

00:05:26.052 --> 00:05:28.456
[REBECCA] Lucy! Are you
eating food off the ground?

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:29.927
When we were wrestling earlier,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.532
two of the lunches
fell on the floor, see?

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.502
You spent hard earned
money on 'em.

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:36.205
I didn't want them
to go to waste.

00:05:36.238 --> 00:05:38.242
Besides, they still taste good!

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.522
You know, you don't
look like a prisoner.

00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.396
Which means you can
buy me lunch again!

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:50.199
[laughs]

00:06:00.688 --> 00:06:02.592
I'll be seeing you
at the finals.

00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:05.430
Yeah! Good luck out there!

00:06:05.463 --> 00:06:07.033
[GUARD B]

[COMPETITOR A]
About time!

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:13.714
Mark my words, that Flame-Flame
Fruit is as good as mine!

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.284
[COMPETITOR B]
You're all talk.

00:06:15.317 --> 00:06:16.485
[COMPETITOR A chuckles]

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:27.809
[REBECCA]
Hey, Mother! Mother!

00:06:27.842 --> 00:06:29.612
Look at all the flowers I found!

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:31.215
[SCARLET]
There's so many of them!

00:06:31.248 --> 00:06:33.052
I picked this one just for you!

00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:35.758
It's beautiful!
Thank you, Rebecca!

00:06:35.792 --> 00:06:39.198
And this is from
your mother to you!

00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:40.200
Right. Let's go.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.235
Yeah!

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:47.213
One-two! One-two!
One-two! One-two!

00:06:50.521 --> 00:06:52.892
We did good selling
all the flowers today!

00:06:52.926 --> 00:06:54.662
[SCARLET] Maybe people bought
so many 'cause I had

00:06:54.696 --> 00:06:56.198
such a cute little helper!

00:07:00.774 --> 00:07:02.411
I say we dig in!

00:07:02.444 --> 00:07:05.283
That sounds like a great idea.

00:07:05.316 --> 00:07:07.822
You must be starving
from all your hard work!

00:07:07.855 --> 00:07:09.458
Yep! I was getting so hungry,

00:07:09.492 --> 00:07:11.362
my stomach wouldn't
stop growling!

00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:12.298
Oh, no!

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:13.801
[BOTH laugh]

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:15.070
[REBECCA]
This is really yummy!

00:07:15.104 --> 00:07:16.138
[SCARLET]
Good!

[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

00:07:24.923 --> 00:07:27.494
[MAN F] King Riku's army
is burning the village!

00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:28.797
[MAN G]
Make them stop!

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.203
It doesn't make any sense!
Why is the king doing this?

00:07:38.884 --> 00:07:41.823
That's the royal palace.
It's on fire!

00:07:43.594 --> 00:07:45.163
Why's this happening?

00:07:45.196 --> 00:07:47.067
Our country's falling apart!

00:07:51.476 --> 00:07:53.714

don't let 'em get away!

00:07:57.454 --> 00:07:58.757
I'll hold 'em back!

[PIRATE C]
Who's the shorty? Shoot him!

00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:20.466
[TOY SOLDIER]
Run! Don't look back!

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.604
[REBECCA]
I'm so hungry.

00:08:38.637 --> 00:08:40.207
Mother, I'm starving!

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.543
[SCARLET]
I know, dear.

00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:43.814
Two days is a long time to wait.

00:08:43.848 --> 00:08:44.582
I'm sorry.

00:08:44.615 --> 00:08:46.185
[stomach growls]

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.537
You'll have to stay here alone
for a while, okay, Rebecca?

00:08:55.571 --> 00:08:58.544
You promise me you won't leave
this spot no matter what.

00:08:58.577 --> 00:08:59.679
[REBECCA]
Huh?

00:08:59.712 --> 00:09:01.883
[SCARLET] I'm going to bring
us something to eat.

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:02.952
[REBECCA]
Really?

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.867
[rustling]

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.235
[REBECCA]
Is that you, Mother?

00:09:39.258 --> 00:09:41.361
I... I couldn't save her.

00:09:44.435 --> 00:09:48.376
I'm sorry! It's my fault.

00:09:48.409 --> 00:09:50.112
I failed to protect your mother!

00:09:53.554 --> 00:09:55.958
She told me to
give you this food.

00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:58.797
That you were waiting here
patiently for her to return.

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:01.770
[REBECCA]
I'm so hungry.

00:10:01.803 --> 00:10:03.072
Mother, I'm starving!

00:10:05.343 --> 00:10:07.347
[SCARLET] I'm going to bring
us something to eat.

00:10:24.314 --> 00:10:28.222
[REBECCA]
Mother? Please, Mother.

00:10:28.256 --> 00:10:30.527
Wake up. Please. Wake up!

00:10:40.346 --> 00:10:42.317
The trail of blood leads
over this way!

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.288
They gotta be around here
somewhere close!

00:10:44.321 --> 00:10:45.389
Keep looking!

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:50.767
[TOY SOLDIER]
Forgive me!

00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:54.374
I'm sorry!

00:10:54.407 --> 00:10:55.443
I'm so sorry!

[stomach growls]

00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:05.329
[TOY SOLDIER]
You have to eat.

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:10.072
Well, if you don't,
I'll just eat it myself!

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:10.974
Here I go!

00:11:11.008 --> 00:11:12.778
I'm about to chew up
all this food!

00:11:19.024 --> 00:11:20.961
Your mother was high-born.

00:11:20.994 --> 00:11:22.497
She was a very special woman.

00:11:25.203 --> 00:11:27.040
These are dangerous times.

00:11:27.074 --> 00:11:30.046
Did you know we
have a new king now?

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:31.482
This new ruler.

00:11:31.516 --> 00:11:34.188
His mission is to capture
anyone who is related

00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:36.459
to the former nobility.

00:11:36.492 --> 00:11:38.396
And because you have
your mother's blood,

00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:39.932
he'll be coming for you too.

00:11:43.305 --> 00:11:46.111
I regret I couldn't save
your mother's life.

00:11:46.145 --> 00:11:50.486
But I will devote mine to
protect yours whatever the cost!

00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:51.957
Someday...

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.361
...happiness will return to you.

00:11:54.394 --> 00:11:56.633
Until then, I will stay
by your side!

I'd rather have my mother!

00:12:07.922 --> 00:12:09.424
I hate you.

00:12:09.457 --> 00:12:11.095
Because you couldn't save her.

I hate you!

00:12:13.534 --> 00:12:15.403
Well, how about now?

00:12:15.436 --> 00:12:18.511
Ha! How could you hate this?

00:12:18.544 --> 00:12:19.579
What if I spin around?

[TOY SOLDIER]
You can't! It isn't safe there!

00:12:27.962 --> 00:12:29.766
The new king has people
watching the village

In the end, they even sank
to stealing valuables

from their citizens in an
act of shameless greed!
