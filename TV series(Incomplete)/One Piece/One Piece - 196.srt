00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:26,241
And how dare you report
to me with this nonsense

175
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,575
about a ship that magically

176
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:29,994
--[JONATHAN clears throat]
--fell out of the sky!

177
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,206
The part about it falling
from the sky is true at least.

178
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:35,709
Huh?

179
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:36,960
I told you.

180
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:38,878
It's not a waste.

181
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,216
Heh. Right, Lieutenant?

182
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:16,875
[JONATHAN]
I see.

183
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,587
Ghost ship, huh?

184
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:24,299
[JONATHAN]
Smells delicious.

185
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,812
[MARINE A gasping]

186
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:39,397
[MARINE A]
Commander! Look at what I found

187
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:40,440
in one of the rooms!

188
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:42,817
[DRAKE coughs]
Huh?

189
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,528
Ingots and a crown.

190
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:47,572
These treasures are quite old.

191
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:49,407
Huh. The pirates
must've stolen them

192
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,284
from some ancient ruins.

193
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:53,286
[DRAKE]
Get them to the lab!

194
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,371
[MARINE A]
Yes, sir!

195
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:58,375
Well then, let's have
a look inside, shall we?

196
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:03,546
[MARINES gasp]

197
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,509
[SOUTH BIRD cooing]

198
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:08,802
What the?

199
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:10,595
Huh? Easy there.

200
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,472
It's just an
ordinary south bird.

201
00:12:12,555 --> 00:12:13,598
[DRAKE]
A south bird?

202
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:15,266
[JONATHAN]
Yes. They always point south

203
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,726
which made them a
prized possession

204
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,939
for the sailors of old,
despite their silly appearance.

205
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:22,440
[SOUTH BIRD squawks]

206
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:24,693
[JONATHAN]
Hey! Oww! Stop it!

207
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:27,237
Get it off me! Get it off me!

208
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,822
[OFFICER A]
Are you okay, sir?

209
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:31,825
[JONATHAN gasps] They certainly
are violent little creatures.

210
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:49,175
[JONATHAN] Hmm. The kitchen
is well maintained.

211
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:54,764
Medical and history
books, sir. New ones.

212
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:58,435
Interesting. Seems these
ghosts study a lot.

213
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:01,146
Not ghosts again.

214
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,689
That's ridiculous.

215
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,946
[JONATHAN]
Excellent work, men.

216
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,115
Stay brave and remember
to keep a watchful eye

217
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:14,367
during your investigation
of this ghost ship.

218
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:20,206
[MARINES murmuring]

219
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,916
Hmph. Back to work.

220
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,418
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

221
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:26,046
[JONATHAN] It would appear
that the ship in question

222
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:28,840
stopped by Jaya quite recently.

223
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:31,343
That coffee was
delicious, was it not?

224
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:32,886
[DRAKE]
Yes?

225
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:35,221
Judging from the color and smell
of the coffee left on deck,

226
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:37,640
one can assume that the
beans are from Jaya.

227
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:39,059
But you must already know this,

228
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:41,644
having courageously sampled
the beverage yourself.

229
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:43,021
[DRAKE]
Uh, well, uh--

230
00:13:43,104 --> 00:13:44,606
[JONATHAN]
And that south bird.

231
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:48,860
That species of bird only
inhabits the jungles of Jaya.

232
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:50,487
Incidentally, there is legend

233
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,281
of a city of gold
that exists there.

234
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,617
Commander, are you telling me
that vessel isn't really a--

235
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,118
[JONATHAN] I don't know
where the ship's crew is,

236
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:59,621
or what they're up to,
but that's no ghost ship.

237
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:01,623
It's just a pirate
boat outta Jaya.

238
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:04,417
And not just any pirates,
it's the Straw Hat Pirates.

239
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:06,836
I should know, I've seen
their boat twice now!

240
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,338
I don't understand, Commander.

241
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:10,340
Weren't you just calling
it a ghost ship earlier?

242
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:12,050
[JONATHAN] Frankly, our men
are all a little too green

243
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,052
to deal with a
situation like this.

244
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:16,721
If we tell everyone that
the notorious Straw Hats

245
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:19,849
have infiltrated our ranks,
it'll cause panic and confusion

246
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:23,311
that will undoubtedly aid
the pirates in their mission.

247
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,939
So for now, we continue
calling it a ghost ship.

248
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:26,856
Understood?

249
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,316
[DRAKE]
With all due respect,

250
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,777
I think we should assemble
a special investigation unit

251
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,321
and begin searching for
the pirates immediately.

252
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,281
And I'd be happy
to lead the team.

253
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:37,367
--[JONATHAN] Don't be so hasty.
--[DRAKE] But--

254
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,994
Our defenses are our
number one priority.

255
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:42,205
You, go reinforce
security at the coast

256
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:43,790
as well as around the sea gate.

257
00:14:43,873 --> 00:14:45,250
Sir!

258
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,626
[JONATHAN] I also want the
ammunition store, the brig,

259
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,461
and all major
passageways secure.

260
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:51,214
You'll have extended authority
to manage related personnel.

261
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:52,674
Right away, sir!

262
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:53,633
[DRAKE grunts]

263
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:55,093
[JONATHAN]
Is there a problem?

264
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:55,927
No.

265
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:57,220
The night is still young.

266
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:59,597
And the darkness will
restrict their movement.

267
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,850
Then again, it will
also restrict ours.

268
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:03,518
At dawn, assemble your team.

269
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:06,813
Then thoroughly investigate any
places where people gather.

270
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:09,315
Places where people
gather? But why?

271
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,026
Here's why.

272
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:13,361
Because it's difficult
to find green insects

273
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,988
living in green grass.

274
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:17,866
If the Straw Hats were to
acquire some of our uniforms...

275
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:18,700
[DRAKE gasps]

276
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,951
You must understand,

277
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:22,537
it's not that I don't
have faith in my men.

278
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,788
But we must keep in mind

279
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:26,499
that we are searching
for a most clever enemy.

280
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,043
[DRAKE growls]

281
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:30,462
[JONATHAN]
Pirates are like stray dogs.

282
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:32,922
They're always hungry.

283
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:34,090
Why don't you start by

284
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:36,718
checking the dining
hall at first light?

285
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:37,927
[BOTH]
Sir!

286
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:41,222
[CHOPPER]
Where did everyone go?

287
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,647
What the heck is this place?

288
00:15:56,571 --> 00:15:57,989
Holy crap!

289
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:03,787
Good thing we still
had this waver.

290
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:11,127
[gasps]

291
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,425
Security is tight.

292
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,387
I'd better find everybody and
get out of here right away.

293
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:33,233
Oh, no. Is this...?

294
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:41,616
Well, look at that.

295
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,160
We've landed in another
fine mess, haven't we?

296
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:45,829
I hope Robin and
Nami were able to

297
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:47,872
get out of the ship okay.

298
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,670
What is it?

299
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:56,589
Well, thought I saw
a light in the trees.

300
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:00,051
I don't see anything.

301
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:08,184
[SANJI groans]
I can't even smoke in peace.

302
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:11,229
[LUFFY]
Hmm...

303
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:16,317
[LUFFY groaning]

304
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:24,534
[LUFFY]
Beef.

305
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:25,744
Pork.

306
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:26,911
Chicken.

307
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:29,414
Fish, beef, pork, meat!

308
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:30,874
Meat! Meat!

309
00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:33,209
[LUFFY groans]

310
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:35,003
[stomach growls]

311
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:36,796
I know there's
some food in there.

312
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,424
One way or another,
I'm gonna find it.

313
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,892
Okay, that didn't work!

314
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:51,144
Chopper would really be
handy right about now.

315
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:52,687
He could smell up
something good.

316
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,731
[stomach growls]

317
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:55,940
[USOPP]
Found 'em!

318
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:01,154
Oh, man, we can't get
anywhere near the Going Merry.

319
00:18:01,237 --> 00:18:03,615
They've got our ship
under a friggin' microscope!

320
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:05,992
[ROBIN]
Oreja fleurs.

321
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:08,912
We looked,

322
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:11,748
and we couldn't find a single
crew member anywhere.

323
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:13,208
That's not even the half of it.

324
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,626
Did you hear that
the maintenance guys

325
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:15,960
said they saw monsters?

326
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:17,879
Yeah. And on top of that,

327
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:20,465
the commander clearly said
this was a ghost ship.

328
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:22,050
That ain't right.

329
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:26,012
Assigning us to watch a creepy
ghost ship in the dead of night.

330
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:27,972
I see.

331
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:29,349
Apparently the
Marines think that

332
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:31,893
the Going Merry is a ghost ship.

333
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,853
Ghost Ship? How rude!

334
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:36,272
Why those--

335
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:38,483
You!

336
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:39,693
Relax.

337
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:41,361
I believe this could
work out in our favor

338
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:44,072
if they go on believing
their little ghost story.

339
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:46,700
Don't you think we can
use it to our advantage?

340
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:50,120
It could buy us some time.

341
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:51,246
I got it.

342
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:52,956
The ghosts must have
stolen cursed gold

343
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,458
and are now doomed to
sail the seas forever.

344
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:58,545
Cut it out, man.
'Cuz I touched that gold.

345
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:01,047
[BOTH gasping]

346
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:03,341
[MARINE A, MARINE D]
Ghosts!

347
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:07,095
[JONATHAN] Straw Hat Luffy
and Pirate Hunter Zoro.

348
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:10,015
We can also assume that the
woman with countless hands

349
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:13,768
and that hairy beast are
also part of the group.

350
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,604
All in all,
there's seven pirates.

351
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,149
Among them are...

352
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:22,360
...a very skilled gourmet cook,

353
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:24,070
a knowledgeable ship's doctor,

354
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:27,198
and possibly a
historian as well.

355
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:29,367
[MARINE J]
I heard something over here!

356
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:31,077
[MARINE K]
This way! Hurry!

357
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,080
They're gonna get me!

358
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:35,040
They're gonna get
me cause I'm lost

359
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:37,375
and I don't know
where I'm going!

360
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:42,756
[CHOPPER pants]

361
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,926
[footsteps]

362
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,178
[CHOPPER whimpers]

363
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:50,180
Now I'm trapped! Cornered!

364
00:19:50,263 --> 00:19:52,057
What the heck am I gonna do?

365
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,352
I gotta think of
something! Think!

366
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:08,490
[MARINE J]
Wait! It's downstairs!

367
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:09,991
[MARINE K]
On my way!

368
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:14,746
[sighs] That was close.

369
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:24,089
All right. Where to next?

370
00:20:26,383 --> 00:20:31,846
[NAMI panting]

371
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:44,567
This is bad.

372
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:47,612
It's enclosed by land
in all directions.

373
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:56,246
[gasps] Then where are we?

374
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:59,833
Did we land in a lake with
no possible way to get out?

375
00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:09,050
At any rate,

376
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,261
obtaining the information
necessary for our escape

377
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:12,929
is our first task.

378
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,390
Let's do this, Long-nose.

379
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:16,641
What do you say?

380
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:18,226
I don't wanna.

381
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:27,777
[MARINE S]
Hm?

382
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:33,450
[footsteps]

383
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:38,121
[footsteps continue]

384
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:49,674
[MARINE S sighs]
It was nothin'.

385
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:53,053
[MARINE S gasps]

386
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,057
That idiot.

387
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,935
Can't he take something
seriously for once?

388
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,313
[JONATHAN]
What I don't understand...

389
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:04,397
...is why.

390
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:06,816
Why are the Straw
Hat Pirates here?

391
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:18,078
[JONATHAN] What could they
possibly be looking for

392
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:20,372
at Navarone?

393
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:22,791
Guess we'll have
to wait and see.

394
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:39,599
<i>A future lies before us</i>
<i>waiting to begin</i>

395
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:42,811
<i>Let's take to the wind!</i>

396
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:47,023
<i>and search the world for answers</i>

397
00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:51,403
<i>to all the questions</i>
<i>in our minds</i>

398
00:22:51,486 --> 00:22:55,865
<i>Exploring day and night we'll...</i>

399
00:22:55,949 --> 00:23:00,912
<i>...live out our</i>
<i>dreams in paradise!</i>

400
00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:03,581
<i>And that's why...</i>

401
00:23:03,665 --> 00:23:06,626
<i>We're running, and running,</i>

402
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,629
<i>traveling along an open road</i>

403
00:23:09,713 --> 00:23:12,924
<i>Never letting go of</i>
<i>what we came to do</i>

404
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:15,468
<i>We're here to see this through!</i>

405
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:18,471
<i>We can't lose, can't lose,</i>

406
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:21,433
<i>nothing on earth</i>
<i>can stop us now</i>

407
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:24,853
<i>'Cause we're not afraid</i>
<i>of our own destiny</i>

408
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:31,526
<i>We Dream and live</i>
<i>our lives free!</i>

409
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:44,414
[USOPP] Of all places,
a Marine fortress?

410
00:23:44,497 --> 00:23:46,166
[LUFFY]
I'm starving.

411
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:47,083
[NAMI]
We can't do anything

412
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:48,543
until we can see
the big picture!

413
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:50,211
[LUFFY]
I'm starving!

414
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,005
[JESSICA]
Let me see that cook's spirit!

415
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:53,340
[SANJI]
Are you talking to me?

416
00:23:53,423 --> 00:23:54,716
[LUFFY]
I said I'm starving!

417
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,718
[JONATHAN] Welcome to
the fortress of Navarone!

418
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,053
[ZORO]
Are you talking to me?

419
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,679
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

420
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:01,014
"Sanji the Cook!

421
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:03,683
Proving His Merit at the
Marine Dining Hall!"

422
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:06,644
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
