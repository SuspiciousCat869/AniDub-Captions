Is this really the Don Krieg,

He could die!

He hasn't had a single
bite to eat for days!

191
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,154

get some food soon!

What?!

202

He's finally weak
enough to be captured.

00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,382
This may never happen again,
and I'm not gonna ruin it

up, he'll keep on doin' 'em.

Don't you realize he's a cold,
heartless, killing machine?!

246
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,833
This is the man known as
the ruler of the East Blue,

the most treacherous
of all pirates!

It all started back in prison...

249
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,841
He pretended to be a Marine...

250
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,377
And when he decided to
declare his pirate ambitions,

251
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,146
he took command
of a Marine vessel

252
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,014
by killing the senior officer!

253
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,385
[CARNE] He would raise the
Marine flag to enter ports,

254
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,521
then lay waste to the
unsuspecting cities

255
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,389
and passenger ships there.

256
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,392
He even showed the white flag
before attacking enemy ships.

257
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,228
He did anything
to secure victory.

258

in physical combat.

just leave us alone?

What?! Are you crazy?!

350
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,330
Good... Hop to it.

351
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,443
Tell me the truth, Sanji!
Are you his spy or something?!

352
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,012
We can't let you go
anywhere near that kitchen.

353
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,848
[COOK D] We're fed up
with you acting insane!

354
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,186
[SANJI]
All right...

355
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,887
[COOKS]
Huh?

356
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,655
[SANJI]
Stop me if you wish.

357
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,560
[SANJI]
I know...

358
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:54,032
It's no secret that Don Krieg
is a terrible, ruthless man.

359
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,135
[COOK A]
Huh?

360
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,170
[SANJI]
But that doesn't matter to me...

361
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,873
[SANJI]
It doesn't matter!

362
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:06,512
After we feed all these men, who
knows what's going to happen...

363
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,681
I am just a simple cook,
no more and no less.

364
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:13,051
If someone's going hungry,
it's my duty to feed them.

365
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,520
That's all I know...

366
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,357
Whaddya say?

367
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,892
Is that wrong?

368
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,564
[SANJI grunts]

369
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,500
Patty!

370
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,435
Hey! Somebody grab him!

371
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,503
[SANJI groans]

372
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,704
[PATTY]
You bring free food to

373
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:37,075
the bums I kick outta this
place, over and over again...

374
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,111
And I'm not about to
argue over who's right

375
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,679
in that particular situation,

376
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:43,749
but this time, you're just
flat out wrong, Sanji.

377
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:47,019
I can't let you do things
like that anymore.

378
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,054
We're going to
protect this place.

379
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,356
Fortunately, we've got
numbers on our side.

380
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,127
It is Don Krieg, but what
could he do against all of us?

381
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,395
[KRIEG growls]

382
00:19:56,428 --> 00:20:00,465
At a joint like this, pirate
scumbags come and go all day.

383
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,969
We're fully prepared to
serve any kind of customer!

384
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,970
Is that...?

385
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,407
I really hope you saved
some room for dessert...

386
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,776
...'cause I have
a secret recipe...

387
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:11,443
[KRIEG]
Huh?

388
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,446
...that is truly to die for!

389
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:19,218
Open wide! Here comes
the Meat Ball of Doom!

390
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,155

[PATTY]
I might've broken the door...

397
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,846
I sure hope Zeff doesn't
yell at me again.

398
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,248
[CARNE]
He might go easy on you for

399
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,083
saving the restaurant and all.

400
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,519
So what are we going
to do about all the guys

401
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,687
left in Krieg's ship?

402
00:20:55,754 --> 00:21:00,125
Fry 'em! Cover it in batter,
and fry the entire thing.

403
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,127
[LUFFY]
Hm?

404
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,296
[USOPP, NAMI gasp]

405
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:09,301
[KRIEG]
Are you a chef or a comedian?

406
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,970
Because your jokes are lame!

407
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,605
[PATTY, CARNE gasp]

408
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,141
[KRIEG]
And that dessert was terrible!

409
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,277

All those guns!

[COOKS groaning]

418

You cooks should
not have defied me!

419
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,315
I am by far the
world's strongest man!

420

Arms, made of solid steel!

Wootz steel body
armor, impenetrable!

422
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:06,091
And a diamond fist that could
pound this entire world to dust.

423
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,327
In addition to the
weapons on my body,

424
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,164
I have a fleet of 50 ships
with five thousand pirates!

My record is perfect!

I've won every single battle
that I've ever been in!

00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,670
I am Don!

428

fit to be called Don!

down to the last letter!

Don't you ever disobey me!

This is about a hundred meals...
