Hey, stop freakin' out.

175
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,939
[USOPP]
Are you crazy, Zoro?!

176
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,141
How can I not freak out
at a time like this?

177
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,810
We're all gonna drown like rats
if we don't get out of here!

178
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,078
Don't you get it?

179
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,581
[VIVI] So it's either my
kingdom or my friends.

180
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,316
All you've done
is take, Crocodile,

181
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,985
so I know you wouldn't
give me either choice!

182
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,253
Even if I left for Alubarna,

183
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:50,856
you'd kill me before
I ever reached it!

184
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,491
The only real choice...

185
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,160
The only way to
end this nightmare

186
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,597
is to take out the
one who started it!

187
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,099
Monster, you don't know a thing.

188
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:05,605
Not anything about this
country's people, its history,

189
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,374
our way of life!

190
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,063
[LUFFY]
Vivi!

191
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,000
Get us out! You can
do it, I know you can!

192
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,369
[VIVI]
How, Luffy?

193
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,903
[CROCODILE]
Ah, so you're finally starting

194
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,239
to beg for your life,
eh, Straw Hat Luffy?

195
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,074
There's no shame in that.

196
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,177
It's only natural.
Everyone is afraid of dying.

197
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,146
[LUFFY]
I'm not begging!

198
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:51,984
It's just if I die, who else is
gonna be able to kick your ass?!

199
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,359
Don't flatter yourself,
you small fry.

200
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,729
You're a small fry who
thinks he's a big shot!

201
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,601
[CROCODILE]
You're right, Miss Wednesday.

202
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,337
I would've had you killed
if you had left for the capital,

203
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,906
and of course, I plan
on doing the same here.

204
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,441
[CROCODILE chuckles]

205
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:27,119
That thing is so gigantic.

206
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,121
Vivi! You show that gator!

207
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,357
Are you crazy?! It's too big!

208
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,060
Vivi, don't listen to
this kook! Get outta there!

209
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,461
But, uh, get us out, too!

210
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,196
[LUFFY]
She only has to beat one of 'em!

211
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,031
[NAMI]
No! Look out the windows!

212
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:42,134
[USOPP] Huh? Ah! They're all
waiting in line to eat us?

213
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,969
[ZORO] At least we
won't drown like rats.

214
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,272
[USOPP] Yeah, but getting eaten
by a ginormous alligator

215
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,708
isn't the way I
wanna go, either!

216
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,713
Peacock String.

217
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,884
That thing is fast! Strong, too!

218
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,152
It chomped through
those stone stairs

219
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,388
as if they were cardboard!

00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,158
Vivi! No!

222
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,226
Can you hear us?!

223
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,229
Please, say something!
Tell us, are you all right?

224
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,933
[LUFFY]
Vivi! Get up!

225
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,801
[NAMI]
Run!

226
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:19,505
[USOPP] Vivi, get outta there!
It's gonna eat you!

[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

228
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,814
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
Someone's calling.

229
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,018
Yes?

230

[SANJI]
Hello? Hello?

231
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,355
Can you hear me?

232
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,958
Yes, we can hear you.
You're a Millions, right?

233
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,826
[SANJI] Hey, pal,
is thing working all right?

234
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,462
I've only used a Transponder
Snail once before.

235
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,864
[MILLIONS A]
It's workin' fine.

236
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,967
They can hear you.
Just talk into it.

237
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,268
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
What do you want?

238
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,836
[CROCODILE] Hurry up
and state your business.

239
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,204
What is it?

240
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,374
[SANJI] Oh, now I know I've
heard that voice before.

241
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,942
[CROCODILE]
Hm?

242
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,515
[SANJI] Yeah, hello there.
You've reached the Crap Café.

243
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,366
[SANJI] Hello there.
You've reached the Crap Café.

244
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,068
[CROCODILE]
The Crap Café?

245
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,236
[SANJI]
Does that ring a bell?

246
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,971
It should, but in
case it doesn't,

247
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,341
maybe this'll jog your
memory: Little Garden.

248
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,409
[SANJI]
Yeah, hello.

249
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,246
You've reached the Crap Café.
Can I take your order?

250
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,315
You can quit foolin' around.

00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,883
A Transponder Snail?

252
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,084
I don't know what
you're talking about.

253
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:43,589
I never used a Transponder Snail
once while on Little Garden.

254
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,358
We have four of the five
Straw Hats inside that cell

255
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,595
based on what Mr. 2 showed us.

256
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,931
The only one that's
left is their pet.

257
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,934
Could they have other members
we don't know about?

258
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,768
Did ya hear that?

259
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,269
[NAMI]
The voice was unmistakable!

‐‐San‐‐!
‐‐Luffy, shut up!

261
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,873
They don't know about him,
so let's keep it that way!

262
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,943
He was in the cabin when Mr. 2
showed up so they never met!

263
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,279
He's our ace in
the hole, so zip it!

Oh, that's right! Sanji and
Chopper didn't get captured.

me who you are?

Me?

268
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:24,029
Well, just call me "Mr. Prince."

269

[CROCODILE]
Very well, Mr. Prince.

270
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,267
Mind telling me somethin' else?
Like where you are?

271
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,969
[SANJI]
I'm afraid I can't say.

272
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,973
If I did, you'd just come
a'running and get rid of me.

273
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,975
Even though I highly doubt
you could get rid of me,

274
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,376
I'm not about to do so.

275
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:41,647
I'm not stupid. I never
give up information easily.

276
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:45,985
Unlike you just did, Mr. 0.
