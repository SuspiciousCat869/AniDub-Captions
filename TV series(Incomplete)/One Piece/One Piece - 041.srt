00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,871
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power...

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:06,539
Gold Roger, the King
of the Pirates,

3
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,275
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,779
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,515
You can have it.

7
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,852
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:21,388
Now, you just have to find it.

9
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,759
[NARRATOR] These words
lured men to the Grand Line

10
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,794
in pursuit of dreams greater
than they've ever dared

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:32,232
to imagine! This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,804
<i>Come aboard and bring along</i>
<i>all your hopes and dreams</i>

13

<i>Your heart will be your guide</i>

17
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,927
<i>Raise the sails</i>
<i>and take the helm</i>

18
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:06,599
<i>That legendary place that the</i>
<i>end of the map reveals</i>

19
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:13,440
<i>Is only legendary</i>
<i>until someone proves it real</i>

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,443
<i>Through it all, through all</i>
<i>the troubled times,</i>

21
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,179
<i>through the heartache,</i>
<i>and through the pain</i>

22
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:24,417
<i>Know that I will be there</i>
<i>to stand by you</i>

23
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,787
<i>Just like I know</i>
<i>you'll stand by me!</i>

24
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:33,526

<i>We are!</i>

29
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,783
Do you know what
the biggest difference

30
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:59,619
between you and me is?

31
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,488
The nose?

32
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,058
The jaw?

33
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:05,992
Webbing!

34
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:10,163
[ARLONG growls]
Species!

Oh, man!

38
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:26,679
I bet that had to be painful.

Assault From the Sea!"

44

[ARLONG]
You see?

45
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,347
This is the inherent
power of fishmen...

46
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,683
I feel sorry for
you pathetic humans

47
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:07,554
having been created with
such limited power...

48
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,522
We've been on a different
level than you since

49
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,857
the beginning of time.

50
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,592
Being such inferior creatures,

51
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,428
it makes perfect sense
for you to bow before me.

52
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,230
[ARLONG chuckles]

53
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:23,269
[laughs]

54
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,404
I'll show you...

55
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,140
...show you the real difference
between you and I...

56
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,077
Okay. But there's no way I'm
gonna lose, to a big fish.

57
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,781
I mean since I am gonna
be King of the Pirates.

60
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,601
[ARLONG]
King of the Pirates...?

61
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,436
Don't be foolish.

62
00:03:56,436 --> 00:04:01,441
A puny human like you couldn't
possibly conquer the Grand Line.

63
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:04,677
You can't even crush a
pillar with your jaws.

64
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,846
He's right. There's no
way a human could do

65
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,483
something like that. If those
jaws got a hold of you,

66
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:14,821
they would do a lot more than
just leave some bite marks.

67
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:19,659
[LUFFY screaming]

68
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:23,630
He'll snap through your
bones like a butcher!

69
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,832
[ARLONG chuckles]

70
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,801
[LUFFY]
Yeah, so what?!

71
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,271
Quit your braggin'!

72
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,774
[LUFFY]
You're not that awesome!

73
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,677
[ARLONG]
Huh?

74
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,714
Besides, smashing stones with
your teeth isn't that smart.

75
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,654
[YOSAKU] Way to go! You're the
best Big Bro! Tell it like is!

76
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,790
[JOHNNY] Yeah! What idiot
bites a rock anyway?!

77
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,194
Fools... That's not the point.

78
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,398
Every member of the human race
is ignorant and weak...

79
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,499
What good are you

80
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,502
if you can't even pull
yourself out of the water?

81
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,674
As a matter of fact,

82
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,344
I'm worthless without my
friends to help me out!

83
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,347

00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,581
[NAMI gasps]

85
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,351
Huh? No way...
Luffy's a swordsman?

86
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,821
[LUFFY yells]

87
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,556
[LUFFY]
Take that! And that!

88
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,390
[ARLONG]
Is this a joke?

89
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,726
Whatever it is,
it isn't swordplay.

90
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,530
You're just flailing about
like a child playing pirates!

91
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,273
I hope you realize
this isn't a game...

92
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,943
[LUFFY yells]

93
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,785
That's enough... Now, die.

94
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,687
[LUFFY]
Shut your face!

95
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,955
[ARLONG]
Huh?

96
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,924
[ARLONG groans]

97
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:13,539
[ARLONG grunting]

98
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:18,778
[VILLAGERS] What?! He just
shattered Arlong's teeth!

99
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,414
[ARLONG groaning]

100
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,550
You're right!

101
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,720
I don't have a clue how to
use a sword, you bastard!

102
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,757
Wait... What exactly is
he trying to say here?

103
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,759
[ZORO grunting]

104
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,064
[LUFFY]
I'm a terrible sailor...

105
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:42,435
...I definitely can't cook...

106
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,270
...and I can't even lie!

107
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:45,905
[USOPP]
Hey!

108
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,740
And without my friends
to help me,

109
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,443
I would have been dead
a long time ago!

110
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:56,449
[ARLONG laughs] So you fully
admit how pathetic you are?

111
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,819
You may be a fool, but you
certainly are honest.

112
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,487
How must your crew feel,

113
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,791
tolerating this idiocy
day in and day out?

114
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,760
I bet they're sick of it.

115
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,997
But that makes me wonder why
they tried so desperately

116
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,000
to save their halfwit leader.

117
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,537
Someone like you doesn't
deserve a ship or a crew.

118
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,606
What good is a helpless,
rubber‐brained captain to them?

119
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,376
What can you possibly do?

120
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,313
I can kick your ass!

121
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,854
Well get to it. Ya numbskull.

122
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,723
If he dies I'm gonna kill him!

123
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,693
[USOPP] Heh, heh, heh.
I've got your back, Luffy!

124
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,895
[DOCTOR]
All‐right Gum‐Gum!

125
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,031
[JOHNNY]
Get him Big Bro!

126
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,401
[YOSAKU]
Yeah! Go for it!

127
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,338
Cheer all you want, but
it won't change a thing!

128
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,974
Uh! He's got new teeth!

129
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,642
[ARLONG]
I'm a shark.

130
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,011
New teeth will grow,
one after another.

131
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:05,051
And with each set they become
stronger and stronger.

132
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,386
Endlessly.

133
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,825
Whoa!

134
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,995
As many as it takes.

[JOHNNY, YOSAKU gasping]

136

This is but one of the many
gifts we fishmen possess.

137
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,742
That's so cool!

138
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,045
If you haven't yet realized
that fishmen are superior,

139
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,581
you will very soon.

140
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,021
Tooth... Attack!

141
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,556
Huh?

[ARLONG] You're dead...
You stretchy freak...

155
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,100
How dare you use my injured
brother as a shield!

156
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,235
What're you talkin' about?

157
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,171
You're the one who attacked me,
don't you remember?

158
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,107
[sighs] That was pretty scary.

159
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:46,319
Don't move a muscle...
Rubber man.

160
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,822
Heh. Hey. Now that's
an interesting idea.

161
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,924
He's got an idea?

162
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,826
It's in his brain.

163
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,830
Did he come up with
some secret scheme?

164
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,031

[ARLONG]
You...

172
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:36,502
You fool. There's no point
in crushing my teeth.

You really don't get it!

174

Big Bro Luffy, uh, that
can't be very sanitary...

Now I have shark teeth!

00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,859
[JOHNNY, YOSAKU gasping]

177
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:03,529
Really, what were they
expecting? It's Luffy.

178
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:10,036
[ARLONG] How long do you intend
to keep fooling around?!

179
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:15,508
[LUFFY screaming]
A shark bit me!

180
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,880
[BOTH]
So stop playin' games!

181
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,049
Well it's not like
I'm having fun!

182
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,884
[ARLONG]
Tooth attack!

183
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,918
[LUFFY grunts]

184
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,391
[ARLONG yells]

185
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,868
[ARLONG yells, chuckles]

186
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,407
[LUFFY yells]

187
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,609
[JOHNNY, YOSAKU]
Oh, no!

188
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:02,254
Gotcha! And now
we're even. [laughs]

189
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,991
So you used my teeth... [grunts]

190
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,095
But... Your puny jaws
aren't strong enough.

191
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,131
Now listen...
Sharp as my teeth are,

192
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,566
they're only useful
when they come

193
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,668
with powerful jaws like mine.

194
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,403
Then they're deadly!

195
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,938
[LUFFY groans]

196
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:23,242
Ahh! Big Bro's gonna
get his arm bitten off!

197
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,410
[NAMI gasping]

198
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:30,449
[LUFFY screams]

199
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,202
[LUFFY yelling]

200
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,307
[yelling continues]

201
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,449
[NAMI gasping]

202
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:13,492
[ARLONG groans]

203
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,645
Is his arm okay?

204
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,547
If he took a
single step back

205
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,215
his arm would've
been ripped off.

206
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,684
Yeah but he wasn't thinking
about how animal fangs work,

207
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,687
that'd require a tiny
bit of brain power.

208
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,162
Is he okay...?

209
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,365
You think Big Bro Luffy's
arm will make it?

210
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,552
[LUFFY]
Hey... Where'd he go?

211
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,055
[NAMI]
Luffy! The sea!

212
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,189
[LUFFY]
Huh?

213
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,260
[LUFFY]
Hey, look! A shark!

214
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,563
[USOPP gasping]
No, that's Arlong!

215
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,071
So wait. He went under?

216
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,240
Oh, crap... This isn't good.

217
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,576
His abilities double in strength
when he's under water.

218
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,648
[ARLONG] Once my momentum
in the water builds up,

219
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,783
it's impossible to stop me.

220
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,319
This is precisely
the kind of ability

221
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,290
that makes us fishmen
all the more superior.

222
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,260
Did he run away?

223
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,640
Now... It's time...

224
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,242
Shark Darts!

225
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:15,814
[LUFFY screaming]

226
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,650
Oh, no!

227
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,252
A torpedo?!

228
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,791
[VILLAGER A] Something just
flew out of the sea!

229
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,826
[LUFFY]
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

230
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,365
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

231
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,833
[ARLONG]
Wow...

232
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,874
I'm impressed you
could dodge that.

233
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:43,977
Good job.

234
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,946
But the longer you
evade your death,

235
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,315
the more painful it will be.

236
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,616
[gasps]

237
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:54,387
[ARLONG]
Shark... Darts!

238
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,566
Whoa.

239
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:10,003
Just what kind of bones does
that crazy shark have?

240
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,339
His nose crushed the ground!

241
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:16,476
[ARLONG]
Shark Darts!

242
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,650
[LUFFY screams]

243
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:28,021
[LUFFY screaming]

244
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:35,595
[USOPP] Hey Luffy, hide! Arlong
went into the sea again!

245
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,497
[LUFFY gasping]

246
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,000
Hurry up, Big Bro!
You gotta hide from him!

247
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,869
He's setting his sights
on you right now!

248
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,705
[NAMI gasping]

249
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,608
Get outta there!

250
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,080
I won't hide.

251
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,782
Stop being so stupid!

252
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,518
Go run for cover before
you become a target!

253
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,787
[LUFFY] No way!
I'm not running anywhere!

254
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,523
I'm gonna catch him
and break his nose!

255
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,458
C'mon!

256
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,360
Ya shark!

257
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,631
[laughs] You've got some nerve!

258
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,066
Or you realized,

259
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:16,536
that it's pointless to
try and hide from me.

260
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,871
Didn't you hear us telling you

261
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,572
that you should go
somewhere and hide?!

262
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,574
You barely escaped
his last attacks!

263
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,144
If he lands just one direct
hit it'll kill you.

264
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,947
Luffy, listen to us!
Go and hide!

265
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,150
Now, Gum Gum...

266
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,988
...Shield!

267
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,790
Hey wait! What's that position?

268
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,626
I don't think that'll
stop the attack!

269
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,062
[ARLONG] I'll get double the
speed from this distance!

270
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:45,665
This time, I'll pierce your
heart rubber man... now...

271
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,836
...take this‐‐Shark Darts!

272
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,177
He's hit!

273
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,979
[NAMI whimpers]

274
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,616
[LUFFY]
Heh, heh, heh!

275
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,919
[ARLONG growls]
Huh?!

276
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:10,090
[LUFFY chuckles]

277
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,192
Oh, no... Did he get hit?!

278
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:15,995
He's fine. He somehow
managed to avoid it.

279
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,667
[laughs] It's over!
That attack, won't work now!

280
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,037
[ARLONG]
Shark Darts!

281
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,539
[LUFFY screams]

282
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:33,113
You bastard!
That was just pure luck!

283
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,814
[ARLONG]
Die!

284
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,616
[LUFFY]
Fat chance!

285
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,651
Gum Gum...

286
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:41,488
...Finger Net!

287
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,624
[LUFFY]
Fishing! Fishing!

288
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:48,728
[ALRONG groans]

289
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:51,197
[LUFFY] And...

290
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,002
[LUFFY]
...Spear!

291
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,178
[ARLONG groaning]

292
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,747
[USOPP squeals]

293
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:12,685
[VILLAGERS cheer]

294
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,523
[LUFFY]
Is he dead?

295
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,095
Do you see the intensity
in his eyes?

296
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,363
Oh, no.

297
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:27,233
It's the same expression that
Sea Kings make before they snap.

298
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,904
[SANJI] He must have snapped
with Luffy's last attack!

299
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,606
[gasps] His eyes...

300
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,209
...I've never seen
them like that.

301
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,678
[ARLONG]
You wretched human!

302
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,014
[LUFFY yelling]

303
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:45,919
[ARLONG] What have you done
to me?! A mighty fishman!

304
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,792
[JOHNNY, YOSAKU gasping]

305
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,961
[USOPP gasps]

306
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,634
Whoa... That was crazy...

307
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,204
It didn't actually hurt but I
can tell he's really like...

308
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,638
...madder...

309
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,706
[ARLONG yells]

310
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,274
[LUFFY groans]

311
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,750
Aw, man... What's that?

312
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,285
The saw blade!

313
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,988
That thing is gigantic!

314
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,327
[ARLONG growls]

315
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,002
[ARLONG yells]

316
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,278
[JOHNNY]
Big Bro Luffy!

317
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,913
[VILLAGERS shouting]

318
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:50,650
[DOCTOR] He won't stop...
Luffy'll get cornered!

319
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,287
[ARLONG yells]

320
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,357
[LUFFY groans]

321
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,292
He jumped in the building!

322
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,095
[JOHNNY, YOSAKU panting]

323
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:11,271
[NAMI] The left window.
On the top floor...

324
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,273
That's the room that...

325
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:17,210
[gasps] That was a
little too close!

326
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:21,314
[ARLONG]
There's nowhere else to run!

327
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,016
You and me... Here...

328
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,019
...in the highest
level of Arlong Park.

329
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:30,623
At last... The time of
your death has come.

330
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,226
What is this room?

331
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,894
Lotta paper.

332
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,996
This isn't just any room.

333
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,965
This is the room
where I made Nami

334
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:42,735
draw all of her sea
charts for me.

335
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,804
[NAMI]
The map room.

336
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,240
[LUFFY]
This is Nami's room...?

337
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,741
[ARLONG]
These sea charts

338
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:53,379
are what she's worked
on all these years.

339
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,580
Just look around you.

340
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,084
These maps are more valuable
than any amount of treasure.

341
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,187
You see to us fishmen collecting
data about the ocean

342
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,824
is a simple affair. But
assembling that raw information

343
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:07,360
into a useful chart
is a difficult task.

344
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,696
That's why we needed a surveyor.

345
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,864
In fact, that is the
sole reason I'm so keen

346
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,200
on keeping that woman
in my possession.

347
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,202
She's absolutely brilliant.

348
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:19,272
The accuracy of her charts
is beyond comparison.

349
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,942
She's too good for
human trash like you!

350
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,411
Her talent should be used
solely for building up

351
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:28,081
the mighty Arlong Empire!

352
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:35,955
Now listen.
Nami belongs to me.

353
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,791
[LUFFY]
Is that so?

354
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,195
And you're interfering
in our business.

355
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:44,430
You human scum!

356
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:48,368
She's not your friend.

357
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:50,870
[LUFFY]
I don't care.

358
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:53,940
I don't care what you say.

359
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,309
[ARLONG]
Huh?

360
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:59,746
Because Nami is our navigator!

361
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:07,153
<i>♪All that's in my heart</i>
<i>confuses me</i>

362
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,155
<i>I cannot understand</i>

363
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,290
<i>As I face what I must do</i>

364
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:14,060
<i>I'll say goodbye</i>
<i>and squeeze your hand</i>

365
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,828
<i>I'll set sail alone</i>

366
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,098
<i>But always know</i>
<i>I'm gonna keep you near</i>

367
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,833
<i>As I drift away</i>

368
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,437
<i>I pray you watch me</i>
<i>as I disappear</i>

369
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,344
<i>As I watch the sunrise</i>

370
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:33,846
<i>I began to wonder</i>

371
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:38,785
<i>What could be the reason</i>
<i>It's so hot inside</i>

372
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:41,020
<i>No answer has come</i>

373
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:45,124
<i>But I can't get away</i>
<i>from what's true</i>

374
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:50,029
<i>It's because of you</i>

375
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,198
<i>Show me how to</i>
<i>catch those feelings</i>

376
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,867
<i>Get 'em to come back to me</i>

377
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,369
<i>I'll do what I must</i>

378
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,839
<i>Because they're</i>
<i>everything I wanna be</i>

379
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,974
<i>Wrap these arms around my dreams</i>

380
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:04,477
<i>And pull 'em back from yesterday</i>

381
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,979
<i>If I'm holding hands with you</i>

382
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,816
<i>I'm sure that we can</i>
<i>make the way♪</i>

383
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,893
[USOPP] Amazing!
It's such a fierce battle!

384
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,229
[LUFFY] I finally figured out
how to save her!

385
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,898
[SANJI] Hurry up and get to it,
you damn rubber man!

386
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,834
[LUFFY]
I'll completely destroy the room

387
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:29,302
that she wants to be free of!

388
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,537
[USOPP]
Go! Get Arlong!

389
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:32,972
[NAMI]
Luffy...

390
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,407
Thank you.

391
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,209
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

392
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:39,579
"End of the Fishman Empire!
Nami's My Friend!"

393
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,381
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates!
