00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.414
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:40.187
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:45.463
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.902
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:51.276
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.376 --> 00:02:52.979
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.384
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:58.557
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:02.498
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.101
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:08.243
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:12.552
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:18.029
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.601
and launched an attack
on the Warlord, Doflamingo,

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.573
who had controlled
the Kingdom of Dressrosa

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:24.308
and threatened to
kill its people.

00:03:24.408 --> 00:03:26.445
In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:26.546 --> 00:03:28.183
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:30.420
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives,

00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:34.395
until finally, Luffy took down
Doflamingo himself.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.367
So you're telling me you didn't
get your memories back

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.005
until two years ago?

00:03:39.105 --> 00:03:40.440
Yeah.

00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:42.345
I'm surprised they
came back to you at all.

00:03:42.445 --> 00:03:43.981
Kinda weird, isn't it?

00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:46.285
I actually have Ace
to thank for that.

00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:47.220
Huh?

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.422
Huh?

00:03:49.258 --> 00:03:50.861
Or that's what I believe.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:56.405
It happened in the worst way.

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:03.688
That tragedy...

00:04:03.788 --> 00:04:06.358
...is what awakened my memories.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:44.067
[gasps]

00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:55.758
[ACE]
Sabo!

00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:57.060
[LUFFY]
Sabo!

00:04:59.298 --> 00:04:59.966
[KOALA]
Sabo!

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.412
[KOALA] Finally found you!
Something wrong?

00:05:06.513 --> 00:05:09.285
I'm fine. I'm just
taking in the view.

00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:10.588
Good.

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:19.438
[KOALA] We've been away from
Baltigo for about a month now.

00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:24.716
I hope everyone's well.

00:05:24.816 --> 00:05:27.689
We've had our hands full
for quite a while, huh?

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.861
We should probably report to
Dragon as soon as we dock.

00:05:44.288 --> 00:05:45.758
What's going on?

00:05:45.859 --> 00:05:47.562
[REVOLUTIONARY A]
Oh, it's the Second in Command!

00:05:47.662 --> 00:05:49.999
Perfect timing! Follow us
to the situation room!

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.370
The war in Marineford
just ended!

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.810
We're on our way to
a briefing about it now!

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:55.878
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:00.354 --> 00:06:02.157
[REVOLUTIONARY C]
Whitebeard's been defeated?

00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:03.426
[REVOLUTIONARY D]
Crazy to think one of the

00:06:03.527 --> 00:06:05.230
Four Emperors is down.

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:07.836
This sounds pretty severe.

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:11.041
There were a lot of casualties
on the Navy's end.

00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:12.846
Where's Iva? They okay?

00:06:13.112 --> 00:06:15.584
It doesn't say. Not here.

00:06:16.285 --> 00:06:18.390
The only reported deaths

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.696
are the Emperor,
Whitebeard, and...

00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:25.704
"Fire Fist" Ace, too.

00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:29.846
[gasps]

00:06:32.184 --> 00:06:34.756
Uh, hey, Dragon. Read this.

00:06:34.856 --> 00:06:36.626
Wait, that can't be true?

00:06:36.727 --> 00:06:39.599
It says here that you're
Straw Hat Luffy's father.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.770
[DRAGON]
Hm? That's correct.

00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:43.573
[REVOLUTIONARIES]
Huh?!

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.890
[ACE]
I'm gonna be a pirate anyway!

00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:15.169
I'll be so tough
that all the other pirates

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:17.843
and all the Marines
will bow at my feet.

00:07:17.943 --> 00:07:21.048
That's gonna be the legacy
I leave behind when I die!

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:29.899
[ACE]
I don't care if people hate me.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.270
I don't care if they
wish I'd never been born.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.874
But they won't ignore me.

00:07:33.974 --> 00:07:35.545
That's what it means
to be strong!

00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:37.180
To be a great pirate!

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:50.741
[SABO panting]

00:07:53.547 --> 00:07:55.183
Sabo? Are you okay?

00:07:58.557 --> 00:07:59.826
You're acting bizarre!

00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:15.858
[REVOLUTIONARY I]
I can't believe that Ace

00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.095
was Gold Roger's son.

00:08:18.195 --> 00:08:20.099
[REVOLUTIONARY E] He was a
pretty big threat to the Navy,

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.103
so I bet they were
itching to get rid of him.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.827
[ACE]
Lemme tell you guys a secret.

00:08:35.463 --> 00:08:37.233
[REVOLUTIONARY E]
It says Akainu punched a hole

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:38.937
right through Ace's chest.

00:08:41.075 --> 00:08:44.649
[panting]

00:08:56.271 --> 00:08:59.879
[ACE] All it takes to become
brothers is to share some sakÃ©!

00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:02.786
Whoa, really? That's so cool!

00:09:02.886 --> 00:09:04.722
[ACE]
We may sail in different seas

00:09:04.822 --> 00:09:07.227
with different crews
on different ships.

00:09:07.327 --> 00:09:10.868
But wherever we go and
whatever adventures we have,

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:14.609
we'll always be brothers,
and nobody can take that away.

00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:20.588
From now on, we're honest
to goodness brothers.

00:09:20.688 --> 00:09:22.323
Cheers to that!

00:09:28.436 --> 00:09:30.741
[ALL]
Brothers!

00:09:36.018 --> 00:09:37.956
[gasps]

00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:39.792
What's come over you, Sabo?

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.689
[screams]

00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:55.691
[KOALA]
Sabo!

00:09:55.791 --> 00:09:56.693
[HACK]
Sabo!

00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.364
[SABO]
That's right.

00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:04.007
The man who died
wasn't just any old pirate.

00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:11.188
[SABO] And he wasn't
some dangerous menace

00:10:11.288 --> 00:10:15.731
of the Great Pirate Era
that needed to be stomped out.

00:10:17.134 --> 00:10:22.243
[SABO]
Ace is my brother!

00:10:47.194 --> 00:10:49.699
You won't catch me running away!

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:51.970
And I'll never lose!

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:01.523
[REVOLUTIONARY K]
The chief's awake!

00:11:01.623 --> 00:11:04.294
[REVOLUTIONARY L] Thank
goodness! That's great news!

00:11:14.481 --> 00:11:18.155
[KOALA cries] We all thought
you were gonna die!

00:11:18.255 --> 00:11:19.959
You big jerk!

00:11:21.395 --> 00:11:23.733
You had a really
high fever, Sabo.

00:11:24.568 --> 00:11:26.806
[KOALA] You've been out
for three days straight!

00:11:26.906 --> 00:11:30.346
We've been so worried! [cries]

00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:37.293
You got your memory back?

00:11:38.997 --> 00:11:41.903
Yeah. I can remember everything.

00:11:42.003 --> 00:11:44.108
Who I am. Where I'm from.

00:11:44.208 --> 00:11:48.382
Even the whole reason I
left home and set sail. [sighs]

00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:53.492
I see. I'm glad.

00:11:54.494 --> 00:11:56.398
You won't leave, will you?

00:11:59.973 --> 00:12:02.143
No. Don't worry.

00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:06.451
Do you know if
Dragon's still around?

00:12:06.552 --> 00:12:07.353
Yes.

00:12:08.624 --> 00:12:10.459
We need to talk.

00:12:26.158 --> 00:12:29.799
At that moment, it felt like
Ace took me aside and said,

00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:31.302
"Hey, you're Sabo.

00:12:31.402 --> 00:12:34.107
And you're a brother
of mine and Luffy's."

00:12:46.967 --> 00:12:48.202
So that's why I--

00:12:48.302 --> 00:12:49.739
[ZORO]
Wait a sec.

00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:53.145
Do not disrupt!
Let the poor man talk!

00:12:53.246 --> 00:12:54.347
Ya' know.

00:12:54.447 --> 00:12:55.951
Huh?

00:12:56.051 --> 00:12:58.022
I saw you polish off
that bottle! It's empty now!

00:12:58.122 --> 00:12:59.926
And how dare you
eat all the meat!

00:13:00.026 --> 00:13:03.232
I required a meaty pallet chaser
after that woeful tale!

00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:05.236
Now, now, let's all calm down.

00:13:05.336 --> 00:13:07.741
He's right. We have
a bigger concern.

00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:09.344
You ate all of the food.

00:13:09.444 --> 00:13:11.883
How do we explain that
to Luffy when he wakes up?

00:13:11.983 --> 00:13:13.486
[FRANKY]
Good going, guys.

00:13:13.587 --> 00:13:15.223
You pounded all of it.

00:13:15.323 --> 00:13:18.029
I volunteer Kin'emon
and myself to procure rations

00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:19.699
from the marketplace
at daybreak.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:20.701
We appreciate it.

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:22.470
Don't forget the booze.

00:13:23.306 --> 00:13:25.745
Luffy's friends with
some real characters, huh?

00:13:25.845 --> 00:13:28.282
You won't get bored. [chuckles]

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.290
Hey. Don't leave us hanging,
finish the story, bro.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.158
Sure.

00:14:01.617 --> 00:14:03.019
Here I am.

00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:05.957
Sorry it took so long, Ace.

00:14:07.895 --> 00:14:09.532
[SABO]
Take a look at this.

00:14:09.632 --> 00:14:11.435
You'll be happy to hear
Luffy's well on his way

00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:13.973
to becoming
the King of the Pirates.

00:14:14.073 --> 00:14:16.345
That's our badass
little brother for ya.

00:14:16.445 --> 00:14:17.346
[cork pops]

00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:38.857
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL B rings]
Cuh-lick.

00:14:38.957 --> 00:14:40.561
[KOALA]
Hey, Sabo?

00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:43.600
[SABO] I have a favor to ask
of the Revolutionary Army.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.506
There's a Devil Fruit that
I need to get my hands on.

00:14:46.606 --> 00:14:48.075
[CROWD cheering]

00:14:48.175 --> 00:14:49.478
[BARTOLOMEO]
But wait! What about

00:14:49.579 --> 00:14:51.516
the Flame-Flame Fruit,
Mister Luffy?

00:14:51.616 --> 00:14:53.587
There's one guy
I hope doesn't win.

00:14:53.687 --> 00:14:54.922
But it's fine.

00:14:55.022 --> 00:14:57.326
The lives of my friends
matter way more!

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:01.503
[BARTOLOMEO]
Don't you worry about nothin'!

00:15:01.603 --> 00:15:04.241
Just go and save the day
and let old Barto

00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:05.944
take care of the
tournament for ya!

00:15:06.044 --> 00:15:08.315
[LUFFY]
Thanks! You're awesome, buddy!

00:15:13.927 --> 00:15:16.131
[SABO] If you think you're
getting the Flame-Flame Fruit,

00:15:16.231 --> 00:15:17.300
you're wrong.

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:22.511
Sorry, Luffy. It's mine.

00:15:23.747 --> 00:15:25.082
[BARTOLOMEO]
Listen up!

00:15:25.182 --> 00:15:26.686
I dunno who the hell
you think you are,

00:15:26.786 --> 00:15:29.491
but that's "Mister Luffy"
to you, you damn punk!

00:15:29.592 --> 00:15:31.529
The Flame-Flame Fruit
belonged to his brother,

00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:33.967
Fire Fist Ace, so nobody
deserves to have it

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.704
more than him!

00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:38.977
Also, he's gonna be King of
the Pirates one day, ya jackass!

00:15:39.077 --> 00:15:41.481
[SABO] I know.
I've known that for years.

00:15:50.233 --> 00:15:51.903
Hey, what's your deal?

00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:54.708
You show up outta nowhere and
tell me I can't have the fruit?

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.398
[SABO]
Luffy. It's me.

00:16:08.603 --> 00:16:10.273
Nope. Don't know ya.

00:16:10.373 --> 00:16:12.978
Listen! That Flame-Flame Fruit
belonged to my brother Ace!

00:16:13.078 --> 00:16:14.515
So don't get in my way!

00:16:15.584 --> 00:16:17.688
And I dunno who
you're calling Luffy.

00:16:17.788 --> 00:16:19.759
You see? It's real, buddy!

00:16:19.859 --> 00:16:21.128
My name is Lucy!

00:16:21.228 --> 00:16:22.665
Give me some credit.

00:16:22.765 --> 00:16:25.269
I would recognize
my own brother anywhere.

00:16:26.038 --> 00:16:27.641
Your "brother"?

00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:31.115
Listen, pal, only two people
can call me their brother.

00:16:31.215 --> 00:16:34.655
Ace and my other
brother who died.

00:16:37.027 --> 00:16:38.663
Way back.

00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:55.163
[LUFFY gasps]

00:16:55.263 --> 00:16:58.168
[LUFFY]
Sabo!

00:17:02.477 --> 00:17:03.345
Liar!

00:17:07.487 --> 00:17:10.159
How else would I know
we stole booze from Dadan

00:17:10.259 --> 00:17:11.562
and shared it together?

00:17:16.773 --> 00:17:19.679
Sabo?!

00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:22.083
[LUFFY sobs]

00:17:22.183 --> 00:17:28.997
[crying]

00:17:29.097 --> 00:17:30.667
Where have you been
all this time?

00:17:30.767 --> 00:17:32.505
Why didn't you
come see me sooner?

00:17:32.605 --> 00:17:34.809
I totally thought you were dead!

00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:36.077
[SABO gasps]

00:17:39.818 --> 00:17:42.658
That means a lot, Luffy.

00:17:42.758 --> 00:17:45.530
I'm glad you're
alive, too, brother.

00:17:51.876 --> 00:17:54.682
I'm sorry, Sabo!

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:58.657
But I saw Ace die and I couldn't
do anything to help save him!

00:17:58.757 --> 00:18:00.225
Yeah.

00:18:00.326 --> 00:18:03.967
Ace may not be with us,
but at least you're here.

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:06.104
You don't know
how grateful I am.

00:18:07.206 --> 00:18:08.643
[SABO]
I nearly lost two brothers

00:18:08.743 --> 00:18:10.547
without being able to
do anything about it.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.421
If something awful
happened to you,

00:18:14.522 --> 00:18:16.726
then I wouldn't have anyone
else left, now would I?

00:18:22.537 --> 00:18:29.484
[crying]

00:18:34.127 --> 00:18:35.262
So, thank you!

00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:41.408
Thanks for staying alive
this whole time, Luffy.

00:18:42.344 --> 00:18:48.756
[panting]

00:18:50.459 --> 00:18:53.800
Would you let me eat
the Flame-Flame Fruit then?

00:18:56.271 --> 00:18:57.841
[LUFFY]
Mm-hm!

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.216
[LUFFY] I really think
it should be yours!

00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:13.840
Would ya look at that!
Luffy's happy.

00:19:14.508 --> 00:19:16.912
Wonder what he's
dreamin' about right now.

00:19:20.286 --> 00:19:21.187
See ya around.

00:19:21.287 --> 00:19:22.456
Oh?

00:19:22.557 --> 00:19:23.960
[SABO]
I got to see his face.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.265
Oh right, this is a
Vivre Card of Luffy.

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:27.734
I had one made up.

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:30.006
Huh? When'd that happen?

00:19:30.106 --> 00:19:31.942
I'll be taking a piece as well.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.220
All right. I'm sure that
Luffy can be a handful,

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.790
but keep an eye on him for me.

00:19:41.361 --> 00:19:43.465
[FRANKY]
Yeah! You betcha, pal!

00:19:47.106 --> 00:19:49.277
It's only natural that I worry!

00:19:49.377 --> 00:19:51.114
You're my kid brother.

00:19:51.616 --> 00:19:54.855
He might be a bit much
for all of you to handle,

00:19:54.955 --> 00:19:56.659
but take good care
of 'im for me.

00:19:56.759 --> 00:19:57.828
Huh?

00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:06.244
[chuckles] Funny. I remember Ace
sayin' the same exact thing.

00:20:08.448 --> 00:20:12.290
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL B ringing]
Cuh-lick.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.328
[HACK]
Sabo? This is Hack!

00:20:14.428 --> 00:20:17.266
Hey. I just left
the house. Coming.

00:20:17.366 --> 00:20:19.839
Roger that. And how was Luffy?

00:20:19.939 --> 00:20:21.375
He seemed like
he was quite the--

00:20:21.475 --> 00:20:22.644
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Cuh-lick.

00:20:27.253 --> 00:20:29.290
Why did he hang up?
The pompous ass!

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.529
Whoa! I'm not Sabo!

00:20:42.518 --> 00:20:44.120
[FUJITORA]
Be my eyes, would you?

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.657
What did it come up?

00:20:46.458 --> 00:20:47.928
One, sir.

00:20:48.028 --> 00:20:49.565
So be it then.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:52.002
Seems the odds are
in Straw Hat's favor.

00:20:52.436 --> 00:20:54.473
It's what we agreed on, right?

00:20:54.575 --> 00:20:56.211
[MAYNARD]
It is, but...

00:20:56.311 --> 00:20:59.383
[FUJITORA] Then I'd say, he won
this round fair and square.

00:21:00.954 --> 00:21:03.225
[FUJITORA] There will be
no arrests tonight.

00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:05.731
You're not serious!
Issho, please!

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.601
We worked hard to find them,

00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:09.872
and you let them go
over a dice roll?

00:21:09.972 --> 00:21:13.245
And after lashing out
at the Fleet Admiral, too!

00:21:13.345 --> 00:21:14.782
This is going to be
our best chance

00:21:14.882 --> 00:21:16.418
to bring in Law
and the Straw Hats!

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:18.321
Hold on, Maynard.

00:21:18.956 --> 00:21:21.596
You should know better
than to take a gamble

00:21:21.696 --> 00:21:24.134
then complain about
the outcome of a roll.

00:21:24.702 --> 00:21:27.707
It's quite unbecoming of a man.

00:21:32.518 --> 00:21:35.289
Has anyone seen Lucy
after the tournament?

00:21:35.389 --> 00:21:36.425
Not that I'm aware of.

00:21:36.526 --> 00:21:38.228
I wanna at least thank him.

00:21:38.328 --> 00:21:40.299
He's probably just laying low.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.805
[TOWNSMAN E] Whether they're
pirates or criminals,

00:21:42.905 --> 00:21:45.677
it doesn't change the fact
that they're our saviors,

00:21:45.777 --> 00:21:47.881
and we owe them everything.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.095
Grandfather!

00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:57.802
Yes, Rebecca?

00:21:57.902 --> 00:21:59.204
[REBECCA] I haven't been able
to find Father, Lucy,

00:21:59.304 --> 00:22:00.574
or the others yet.

00:22:01.108 --> 00:22:03.445
Yes. No need to worry.

00:22:03.546 --> 00:22:06.151
Kyros has already contacted me.

00:22:06.251 --> 00:22:07.888
They are all safe together.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.526
Ah.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.603
[DOLDO]
That aside. Rebecca.

00:22:18.175 --> 00:22:21.481
[DOLDO] Should I agree to
return to the throne,

00:22:21.582 --> 00:22:24.387
you do understand,
that will make you a princess?

00:22:24.487 --> 00:22:25.890
[gasps]

00:22:41.589 --> 00:22:43.593
So, are we pretty much
good to go?

00:22:43.693 --> 00:22:45.296
[KARASU]
Yes, anytime.

00:22:45.396 --> 00:22:47.701
Nice. Once we get
back to Baltigo,

00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:50.807
there is so much I want
to tell Dragon about Luffy!

00:22:52.477 --> 00:22:53.980
'Til next time.

00:22:55.082 --> 00:22:57.788
[SABO]
It was nice to see you again.

00:22:57.888 --> 00:22:59.023
Let's hurry!

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:16.057
[NARRATOR] After eluding
the Big Mom Pirates,

00:23:16.157 --> 00:23:17.961
the Straw Hats aboard
the Thousand Sunny

00:23:18.061 --> 00:23:21.034
become separated after arriving
on a dangerous new island.

00:23:21.134 --> 00:23:23.773
Meanwhile, a terrifying man
with boundless power

00:23:23.873 --> 00:23:25.276
descends from the sky and

00:23:25.376 --> 00:23:27.146
crashes right into
Kid's territory,

00:23:27.246 --> 00:23:29.384
proclaiming that he
wants to start a war!

00:23:29.484 --> 00:23:31.020
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.758
"The Strongest Creature!

00:23:32.858 --> 00:23:36.464
One of the Four Emperors
Kaido, King of the Beasts!"

00:23:36.565 --> 00:23:39.136
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
