1
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:38,250
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,891
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:45,297
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,273
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:52,445
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:53,548
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:57,254
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:57,287 --> 00:02:59,425
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,799
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:05,905
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:09,378
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:12,284 --> 00:03:13,888
[LUFFY] And thank you, Merry.

13
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:16,527
We never would've made it
if you weren't there.

14
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,931
[LUFFY] I was pretty surprised
when you showed up,

15
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:19,833
but when I think about it,

16
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,404
you've always been
there to protect us.

17
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:24,676
We've always counted on you.

18
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:25,845
Anyway, I'm just happy

19
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:27,849
you've been part
of the team, Merry.

20
00:03:27,882 --> 00:03:30,254
You're a good friend to have.

21
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:32,592
[FRANKY] I don't mean
to spoil the mood,

22
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,899
but damn, you guys did
some crazy stuff back there.

23
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:36,901
[FRANKY] I don't
think the government's

24
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:38,638
gonna let you off that easy

25
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:40,608
after you burned
down their flag.

26
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:42,411
[LUFFY] Eh, whatever.

27
00:03:42,444 --> 00:03:45,552
It doesn't feel
like a big deal to me.

28
00:03:45,585 --> 00:03:47,421
[LUFFY] The only reason
I did any of that

29
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:50,528
was 'cause they took our
friend and I wanted her back.

30
00:03:56,673 --> 00:03:58,043
[LUFFY] Thank you, Merry!

31
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:00,915
Snow Falls over the Parting Sea!

32
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:05,558
[LUFFY] Hey! Usopp!

33
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:06,425
Are you there?

34
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,330
[CHOPPER]
Where did you run off to?

35
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:09,365
Come back!

36
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:13,006
[LUFFY] Hey! Usopp!

37
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,943
[LUFFY] Thought he'd
be up here for sure.

38
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:17,849
Where are you hiding?

39
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,686
Are you in there?

40
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,857
Usopp?

41
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,830
[LUFFY]
Seriously, I just saw him!

42
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:26,800
[SANJI]
Hey, they're calling you.

43
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,307
[USOPP] No, I can't.
It's too soon.

44
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,079
[LUFFY]
Stop playing hide and seek!

45
00:04:33,112 --> 00:04:33,914
[giggles]

46
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:36,319
Get out here
or I'll kick your ass!

47
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:38,925
Kick your ass!

48
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,496
Hey, do you know where
Usopp's at, Sniper King?

49
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,066
You're his friend, right?

50
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,337
[USOPP]
Oh, ah, no need to fear.

51
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,975
He took a different boat
and went on ahead by himself.

52
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:50,615
But why?

53
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:51,850
That doesn't make sense!

54
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:53,788
The Merry's his ship, right?

55
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:55,457
You gotta be kidding me.

56
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,860
If they haven't
figured it out yet,

57
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:58,597
then what's it gonna take?

58
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:02,872
Not here, either.

59
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:06,513
What the heck is going on?

60
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:10,688
[NAMI] I checked everywhere.

61
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,460
Looks like we're
the only ones on the ship.

62
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:14,529
[SANJI] That's pretty strange.

63
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:17,535
[NAMI] The Merry didn't
sail itself here, did it?

64
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,938
[ZORO] Of course not.

65
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:20,808
Someone was calling us.

66
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:22,411
The whole crew heard it.

67
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:23,915
[KOKORO] And you
don't know who it was?

68
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,750
[ROBIN] No.

69
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,620
Just a voice
beckoning us to the sea.

70
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:29,025
Come on, you guys,
the answer here is obvious!

71
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:31,530
I'm telling you, that was
Merry's voice we heard!

72
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:33,967
Huh? You think so?

73
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:37,709
Merry! Come on!

74
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:38,844
Say something else!

75
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:41,951
[ZORO] I think we'd know
by now if the ship could talk.

76
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:44,623
Y'know, as ridiculous
as it may sound,

77
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:47,494
I was thinking the same thing.

78
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:49,700
[NAMI]
But there's no way, right?

79
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:51,468
That's impossible.

80
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:54,642
[FRANKY] Hm?

81
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:04,095
[USOPP] The whole
situation remained a mystery.

82
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:07,468
For some reason, these words
lingered in my heart.

83
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:08,504
[USOPP] I don't know
if it's something

84
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:10,073
I actually heard someone say,

85
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:12,712
or maybe just
something I imagined.

86
00:06:14,214 --> 00:06:15,784
[VOICE] Don't worry.

87
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,793
[VOICE]
I'll carry everyone

88
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:22,164
for a little bit longer.

89
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:26,105
I know it sounds
ridiculous, but I--

90
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:31,182
I think it was--
An incarnation of the Merry.

91
00:06:31,215 --> 00:06:33,486
And she spoke to me.

92
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:38,531
You think I'm completely
out of my mind, don't you?

93
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,935
I don't care.
You don't have to believe me.

94
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,507
[FRANKY]
Whether I believe it or not,

95
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,645
you said that
whoever it was you saw

96
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:49,586
looked like someone holding
a wooden mallet, right?

97
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:50,788
That's right.

98
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:52,424
Does it mean something?

99
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:55,497
[FRANKY] Yeah, it sure does.

100
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:58,103
It means that you
saw a Klabautermann.

101
00:06:58,136 --> 00:07:00,206
Kla--Klabau-what?

102
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:03,881
A Klabautermann.

103
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:07,956
It's an old legend that's passed
down from sailor to sailor.

104
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:09,993
[FRANKY] The more
care a ship receives,

105
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:12,866
the more they grow
to appreciate the sailors.

106
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,101
[FRANKY] This ship
must've been determined

107
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:18,143
to make sure you made it to
the next shore, no matter what.

108
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:19,880
Just think about it.

109
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:23,153
This ship had a caring crew
that was so special to her.

110
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:24,823
She even appeared in human form

111
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:28,196
to reassure them that everything
was going to be all right.

112
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:30,834
I betcha she's been very happy.

113
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:45,263
I see.

114
00:07:45,296 --> 00:07:47,902
So it was you.

115
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,673
You were the one
who made those repairs

116
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:52,545
and spoke to me
back then, weren't you?

117
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:55,049
Merry.

118
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,103
Hey, look!
There's a ship coming!

119
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:07,273

00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:10,013

They're alive!

00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:12,217
[RANDOM SHIPWRIGHT 312C]
I knew they'd make it!

123

I just knew it!

124
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:16,627
[SANJI] It's a
Galley-La Company ship!

125
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,529
[RANDOM SHIPWRIGHT 312D]
I thought they were done for

126
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,733
when they went out
during Aqua Laguna!

127
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,202
[RANDOM SHIPWRIGHT 312A]
Forget Aqua Laguna!

128
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,205

00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:27,715
Ahoy!

00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:29,318

Nico Robin survived.

133
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:42,846
They pulled it off after all.

134
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,117
They took on the

[cheering]

136
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,904

then they brought it all back.

138
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,168

Their ship! It's breaking!

[ZORO] Hey, why's it falling
apart all of a sudden?

141
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:19,920
[SANJI] There's
nothing sudden about it.

142
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:21,856
We all knew this was inevitable.

143
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:25,163
They told us, right?

144
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:27,836
Before we left, they said
Merry was unfit to sail.

145
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:29,137
[LUFFY] Yeah, but--

146
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:32,778
What happened to you, Merry?

147
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:39,693
[LUFFY] Ice Pops, help!
Merry's in trouble!

148
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:41,262
Can't you do something?

here just in time!

I'm begging you!
Don't let her die now!

Merry's more than just a ship!

She's a member of our crew!

If it wasn't for her,
we all would've died back there!

You gotta get outta there!

176
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:47,146
Another tidal wave's
about to hit!

177
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:55,731
[MERRY]
Thank you.

178
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:21,215
Huh? Ready a ship?

179
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:23,319
The weather's still
too rough out there!

180
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:25,056
[ICEBERG] Then I'll go alone.

181
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:26,258
[RANDOM SHIPWRIGHT 312B]
Are you kidding?

182
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,027
[RANDOM SHIPWRIGHT 312C] No, no.

183
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,362
We'll go with you!

184
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:32,839
This is a miracle.

185
00:12:32,872 --> 00:12:34,809
There's no other word for it.

186
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:37,882
The miracle of a ship
that's gone beyond its limits

187
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:40,386
to see you one last time.

188
00:12:42,223 --> 00:12:45,230
As you know, I've been
a shipwright for many years.

189
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:48,803
But I've never seen a ship
as incredible as this one.

190
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:52,210
[ICEBERG] It's lived
a wonderful life.

191
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:02,564
[MERRY]
Let's go back, everyone!

192
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:09,010
[MERRY] Back to
the seas of adventure!

193
00:13:09,377 --> 00:13:13,252
Merry!

194
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:15,456
[MERRY]
I came to get you!

195
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,927
[LUFFY] I understand.

196
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,510
Well? Guys, you ready?

197
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:49,545
Yeah.

198
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:57,928
[LUFFY] Merry.

199
00:14:57,961 --> 00:15:01,001
I know the floor of the sea
is a dark and lonely place,

200
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,472
but don't worry.
We're here to see you off.

201
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:09,418
[LUFFY] And I'm sure
you wish he was here,

202
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,625
but it's probably best
that Usopp isn't around.

203
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:14,461
I don't know if
he could take this.

204
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:16,600
Well, is that true?

205
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,637
[USOPP] Of course it isn't.

206
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,308
We all must say
our farewells someday.

207
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:23,312
Every man knows that.

208
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:25,550
We must hold back our tears.

209
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:33,131
[USOPP] Luffy knows
what has to be done.

210
00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:06,298
[LUFFY] Thank you for
carrying us for so long,

211
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:08,670
and for so far, Merry.

212
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:22,664
Snow?

213
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,091
A real caravel!

214
00:16:36,124 --> 00:16:37,126
Yeah!

215
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,705
[LUFFY] Now the
Going Merry has everything

216
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:45,711
she could possibly need!

217
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:49,450
[LUFFY] Cheers to a
new ship and a new crewmate!

218
00:16:58,703 --> 00:17:01,241
[NAMI] Look at all the damage
you did to poor Merry!

219
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:03,680
A crew has to
take care of its ship!

220
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:05,684
And don't you forget it!

221
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:07,821
Right. We're sorry.

222
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,796
Hey, Luffy,
what's so loud down there?

223
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,101
Cannon firing practice!

224
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,738
But it's not going very well.

225
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:18,342
[USOPP] Let the expert
aim the thing.

226
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,585
[LUFFY] Awesome!

227
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:25,557
You hit that on the first try!

228
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,526
Whatcha think?

229
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,195
So are you impressed yet?

230
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:42,792
[LUFFY] Zoro!

231
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:46,165
That's the Captain's seat!

232
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,201
[NAMI]
Hey! Look! A light!

233
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:54,414
I'm going to the Grand Line
to find the All Blue!

234
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:57,521
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

235
00:17:57,554 --> 00:18:00,293
The world's best swordsman!

236
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:04,234
I'm going so I can draw
a map of the whole world.

237
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:08,108
I'm going to be a
brave warrior of the sea!

238
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:12,283
[LUFFY]
And now to the Grand Line!

239
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:24,776
The entrance to the
Grand Line is a mountain.

240
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:26,712
A wha--?

241
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:45,183
[ALL] We made it!

242
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:46,151
I can see it!

243
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:48,924
This is the greatest sea
in the whole world!

244
00:18:48,957 --> 00:18:50,594
The Grand Line!

245
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:52,329
Let's go!

246
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:16,311
[LUFFY laughing]

247
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:19,217
[LUFFY] We're flying!

248
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,554
Don't bother looking back!

249
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:23,291
'Cause we're
going straight ahead!

250
00:19:29,738 --> 00:19:31,943
I'm afraid there's
nowhere left for me to go.

251
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:32,945
And for that matter,

252
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:35,551
there's no place for me
to return to, either.

253
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:37,788
So I've decided
to stay here with you.

254
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:39,357
I see your problem.

255
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,961
Guess there's no other choice.

256
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:41,930
Welcome.

257
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:43,700
Luffy!

258
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:44,334
Trust me.

259
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:46,639
I'm a navigator, aren't I?

260
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:49,311
[LUFFY] We're flying!

261
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:50,480
Yeah!

262
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:52,984
We're headed to the sky!

263
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,265
[LUFFY]
There it is! Sky Island!

264
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:22,731
[MERRY]
I'm sorry.

265
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:31,983
[MERRY]
I wanted to carry everyone

266
00:21:32,016 --> 00:21:33,986
just a little bit further.

267
00:21:36,124 --> 00:21:38,630
[MERRY]
I had so much fun.

268
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:41,468
I wish our adventures
would never end.

269
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:43,371
Merry!

270
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:46,745
[SHIPWRIGHT 312C]
Who is that?

271
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:50,721
[MERRY]
But I'm sorry, I can't--

272
00:21:50,754 --> 00:21:51,756
[LUFFY] No, Merry!

273
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:55,096
If anyone should apologize,
it's us, not you!

274
00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:56,833
[LUFFY] I'm no good at steering.

275
00:21:56,866 --> 00:22:00,774
I ran you into icebergs
and all kinds of stuff.

276
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:03,880
I took bad care of you
and ripped your sails.

277
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:08,389
Zoro and Sanji are idiots, too.

278
00:22:08,422 --> 00:22:11,395
They were breaking
your stuff all the time!

279
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:14,902
[LUFFY] Usopp tried to fix you,
but he wasn't any good at it.

280
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:16,906
We all know that.

281
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:20,613
If anyone's sorry, it's--
It's us!

282
00:22:22,183 --> 00:22:25,991
[LUFFY crying]

283
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:27,393
[MERRY]
I don't mind.

284
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:28,863
I was happy.

285
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,178
[MERRY] I know you
always treated me with love.

286
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:37,747
Thank you.

287
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:47,735
[MERRY] Even if the time
we spent together was short,

288
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:52,376
I'm glad that I could
spend it with you.

289
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,807
[LUFFY] Merry!

290
00:23:16,024 --> 00:23:19,197
[KOKORO] It was a lotta work,
but we're finally back!

291
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,066
[CHIMNEY] Yeah!

292
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,201
[GONBE] Meow!

293
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:23,873
[KOKORO] Now it's time
to get Water 7 back to normal.

294
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:26,478
Looks like there's some kinda
hubbub going on, though.

295
00:23:26,512 --> 00:23:27,548
[CHIMNEY] No kidding!

296
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:28,984
The Marines are here!

297
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:29,685
[GONBE] Meow!

298
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:31,188
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

299
00:23:31,221 --> 00:23:32,591
Peace Interrupted!

300
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:35,530
A Navy Vice-Admiral
with the Fist of Love!

301
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:37,934
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
