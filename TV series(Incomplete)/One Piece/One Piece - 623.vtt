[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:46.706
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:49.275
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.512

all the secrets they held.

For the rest of the

the end of the road.

the Four Emperors.

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.842
Their first stop is Punk Hazard,

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:26.179
an island divided into
freezing and burning halves.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.214
There, they soon discover
the twisted motives

behind the ruler of the island,
the mad scientist Caesar Clown.

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:34.454
Aided by Trafalgar Law

you can't possibly
expect me to keep it.

You're a pirate.

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.980
But if you wanted to silence me,

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:10.383
you had plenty of opportunities
to do it earlier.

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:14.988
Using Straw Hat, what
exactly are you planning?

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:20.293

If you really need to know,

I'm talking about Kaido,
King of the Beasts.

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:34.240
Sure, as long as Shanks isn't
first, I'm cool with that.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.441
And besides,

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:39.479
I'm already plannin' on crushin'
all Four Emperors anyway.

you can beat them all?

We share a common goal,
but I warn you, it ain't easy.

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.854
These are the strongest
fighters on the seas.

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.455
They've gone head-to-head
with Whitebeard

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.858
and lived to tell
about it, remember?

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:54.694
Not only that,
our target, Kaido,

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:58.131
is considered the most
powerful creature in the world.

00:04:58.164 --> 00:05:01.367
What? Creature?
He's not even human?

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.137
We'll work together
to beat Kaido.

After that, our
alliance comes to an end.

If you're curious about
our chances of success...

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:12.145

and I'll leave it at that.

It's not a plan, it's
a suicide mission, Luffy!

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:22.488
In that case...

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:24.657
...my answer is yes!

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:26.259

Can we talk this over
for just a minute?!

Not that I wanted you alive.
That's just how it worked out.

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:36.736
Don't read into it.

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:40.006
By the way, after we leave here,

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.575
I'm thinking about
heading over to Green Bit.

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:45.178
Who knows? The Straw
Hats may be useful.

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:48.114
Or maybe I'm the one
who's useful to them.

[MARINE P] If any of you wanna
say goodbye to the pirates,

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.148
you're just rotten kids!

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:17.450
And if you wanna thank them,

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:20.086

[TASHIGI gasps]

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:26.492
[MARINE Q] Listen up! Pirates
are good-for-nothin' punks!

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:28.027
Marines are where it's at!

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.961
[MARINES]
Yeah!

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:30.529
And wherever there's
chaos in the world,

we guarantee you it means
there's a pirate close by!

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:35.234
You're young, but you
should know that fact!

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:36.936
There's no way we'll
ever forgive 'em

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:38.504
for the damage they've done!

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:40.106
Not in a million years!

Yeah!

00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:45.211

[gasps]

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:04.664
...they gave it without
a second thought!

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:08.000
They didn't even
know who we were,

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:09.468
what was wrong...

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.671
But they took us with
them and never complained

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:15.207
about our size or said
we were slowing them down!

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:17.410
When can we leave
this place and go home?

Trust me, it'll happen
soon! Just hang tight!

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.014
We were trapped on this island.

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:24.383
And no one was
gonna come save us!

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:25.751
But the pirates did!

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:28.454

So sorry that we didn't get here

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:39.632
Pirates are filthy! Everyone

On the other hand,
the Navy... is always clean!

They won't let us say thank you!

The Navy's worse than Caesar!

00:12:05.024 --> 00:12:06.826
Don't say that! I'm sorry!

amount, but still.

surprised if the Straw Hats

Hello, Law.
It's been far too long.

choose to show your face.

What's his name?
I keep forgetting.

That's right. Kaido,
King of the Beasts.

But he doesn't strike me
as the bargaining type.

I'm only asking for you to
abandon a decade of hard work.

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:14.439
To go back to being
a simple pirate.

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:17.142
Unfortunately,
once that happens,

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:18.744
the Navy Admirals
at headquarters

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:22.581
won't be able to turn
a blind eye to you any longer.

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:24.349
You have until tomorrow.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.818
[LAW]
If I look in the morning paper

00:21:26.852 --> 00:21:28.186
and see a headline announcing

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.522
your resignation
from the Warlords,

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:33.258
then I will call you
and the deal is on.

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:34.426
[DOFLAMINGO growls]

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:35.961
[LAW]
But if I don't see it,

00:21:35.994 --> 00:21:39.431
then my offer is
as good as dead.

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:41.099
So long.

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:45.337
Just a damn minute! Law!

00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:56.415
[DOFLAMINGO sighs, grunts]

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:57.983
Young Master!

00:21:58.016 --> 00:22:00.952
[DOFLAMINGO grunts]

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.654
[BUFFALO grunts]

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:11.063
[DOFLAMINGO]
I'm gonna kill that brat!

00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:17.769
[NARRATOR] While sailing
towards the next island

00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:20.305
of the New World,
everyone is left in shock

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:23.942
as Law reveals his plan to
defeat the Four Emperors.

00:22:23.975 --> 00:22:25.877
Meanwhile, back on Punk Hazard.

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:28.013
Doflamingo descends
from the skies

00:22:28.046 --> 00:22:32.284
and proceeds to decimate
Smoker and the G-Five forces.

00:22:32.317 --> 00:22:34.052
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:38.256
"The G-5 Wiped Out!
Doflamingo's Sudden Attack!"

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.126
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
