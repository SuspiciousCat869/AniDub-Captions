00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.465
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.868
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.787
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.123
These wild and dangerous
seas are known

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:48.001
as the New World.

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:50.128
Gold Roger and his
crew were the only men

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.963
to ever chart these
waters and learn

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:53.840
all the secrets they held.

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:55.717
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:58.136
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.096
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:03.892
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.977
a boy whose body
became rubber after eating

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.022
the Gum-Gum Fruit,
sets sail into the New World

00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:10.815
with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:14.194
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:19.532
[NARRATOR] After a fierce battle
at the bottom of the sea,

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.910
the Straw Hat Pirates
depart for the deadly waters

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:25.455
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:28.750
Receiving a distress call,
the crew lands on Punk Hazard,

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:31.294
an island split into two
sections with extremely

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.046
different climates.

00:03:33.087 --> 00:03:35.840
G-5, led by Vice Admiral Smoker,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.760
arrives at the island
in pursuit of the Straw Hats.

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.845
But they soon
meet Trafalgar Law.

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:50.939
[LAW]
Scalpel!

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:56.694
[SMOKER]
My heart!

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.913
[BROWNBEARD]
But then the Master arrived,

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:09.791
a kind and generous savior.

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:13.670
[crying] Master!

00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:17.548
This island, Punk Hazard,
is the domain of our savior.

00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:21.010
[BROWNBEARD chuckles]
No, don't cry.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.720
The Master
continues his research

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.681
for the betterment of mankind.

00:04:24.722 --> 00:04:26.808
To do so, he needs
test subjects,

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.395
and each of you will have
the honor of becoming one.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:33.648
Like it or not, you're his!

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.446
[LUFFY]
"Chopper's Fury!

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.907
The Master's
Inhumane Experiment!"

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:48.997
[GROUP crying]
Oh, Master!

00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:51.541
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)] He must be
a really nice man, huh?

00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:53.251
Yeah. That's true.

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.877
He's a wonderful person.

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.462
The Master is super!

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:57.505
Merciful!

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:58.840
Mankind's last hope!

00:04:58.881 --> 00:05:01.175
Gimme a break,
you don't even know the guy!

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:02.635
Are you even listening?

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:03.803
We!

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:04.554
Love!

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:07.140
The Master! Whoa!

00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:08.683
What the hell's goin' on?!

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.812
Why'd I puff up like this?!

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:13.896
[LUFFY]
A fuzzball!

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:15.356
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
Yeah, that's called Guard Point.

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.692
It's one of six different forms
you can change into.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.485
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)]
It'll just change on a whim?

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:20.486
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
Get used to it!

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:23.114
Hey, I'm not a toy,
so quit playin' with me!

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:27.160
[yelling]

00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:28.453
Seriously?

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.038
The samurai just ditched us?

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.955
Yes.

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:31.956
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Damn it!

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.958
I thought it was a little
too quiet around here.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.418
When I mentioned
that I had fought

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.755
with a lone torso earlier,
he asked me where I had seen it.

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:41.674
I told him I lost it somewhere
around the lake.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.468
That's when he
went storming off,

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:46.721
presumably to go and look
for his missing middle.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.806
I must've missed it
'cause I was distracted

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:51.017
by Nami's sexy body!

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.978
What does it matter
to you, Sanji?

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:55.396
[SANJI (NAMI)]
I'm the one who took him out

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.148
of the cell and
brought him with us.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:06:01.152
The poor guy. He couldn't move.

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:05.907
Like it or not,
I'm responsible for the guy.

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:07.867
If anything were
to happen to him,

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.660
it'd be my fault.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.163
I see. He can't hold a sword.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.665
Therefore, if an enemy
were to attack him,

00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:16.334
all that he could do
is run away.

00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:20.463
Well? What now?

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.006
He could be in danger.

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:24.675
Damn it. Let's go find him.

00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:26.386
Luffy, I'll be right back.

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:27.595
You just stay put.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.430
'Kay! I'll try!

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.723
[BROOK]
I'll make you a deal.

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.225
I'll show you the way,

00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:33.726
but only if you'll show
me your panties.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:34.769
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Works for me!

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.979
Aw man, I'm still
wishing I had a camera!

00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:39.482
Oh, no you don't!

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:42.026
[BROOK yells]

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:44.237
Hey! You've gotta go with them!

00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:45.822
[ZORO groans]

00:06:45.863 --> 00:06:48.282
If Zoro's there,
that means Sanji'll

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:51.285
be too busy arguing
with him to be lewd!

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.246
I can't believe I'm being
forced to go search

00:06:53.287 --> 00:06:55.039
for that farting samurai
in this weather

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.375
just 'cause you
can't control yourself!

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.668
You idiot!

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:00.294
Do you think I want you here?

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:01.921
I wanna be around guys
who can share

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.256
in my happiness!

00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:04.924
Not a loser like you!

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:08.261
Ah... Why was I
the only one hit?

00:07:08.302 --> 00:07:10.555
I hope I didn't break a bone.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:11.681
No.

00:07:11.722 --> 00:07:13.599
The only thing broken is my
panty-loving heart.

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:15.393
[arguing]

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.192
[CHOPPER (SANJI)] It's nice
to see them happy, isn't it?

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.944
Just like normal kids.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:26.487
[CHILDREN laughing]

00:07:26.487 --> 00:07:27.905
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Yeah, you're right.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.949
And they're so full of energy.

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:32.160
They don't look like
they're sick at all.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:38.791
[CHILDREN]
Super!

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:43.337
I wonder what's making them ill.

00:07:43.337 --> 00:07:44.672
I'll do some research.

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:46.799
Awesome!
Can I do anything to help?

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:47.925
Yeah.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:50.803
Would you please collect samples
of their sweat for me?

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:51.846
Thank you.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.728
'Kay, that should do it.

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:00.104
[MOCHA]
'Scuse me, Miss?

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.856
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Hm? What is it?

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.525
Do you think I'll get better?

00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:08.571
It's just that I wanna see
my mommy and daddy.

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:10.781
Yeah, I know you do, Mocha.

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:13.242
Don't worry.
I'll get you back to them.

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:15.036
I promise I'll find a way.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.128
[USOPP] All right, we need
to come up with a plan.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.796
Where do we go from here?

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:27.131
First things first,
we need to get

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.050
our regular bodies back
as soon as possible!

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.219
I'm sick and tired
of being a giant perv!

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:34.931
Aw, c'mon!
You know ya love me, Nami!

00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:35.973
Franky.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:39.227
Don't smile with his face.
It's creepy.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.686
You're no fun.

00:08:40.728 --> 00:08:42.480
So, about the ankle-biters.

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.732
What'll we do?
Any bright ideas?

00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:47.860
Franky. I beg you.

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:51.072
Please don't speak while
you're in Chopper's body.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.406
Not one word!

00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:55.409
[SYND grunts]

00:08:55.409 --> 00:08:56.744
[DOLAN]
You ready?

00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:58.246
[BOY A]
Yeah, just try it!

00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:02.667
[GIRL C] Synd, you wanna have
a snowball fight with me?

00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:08.381
What's the matter?
Are you okay?

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:12.885
[SYND grunts]

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.679
I can't breathe.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.764
[grunting]

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.768
[GIRL C yells]

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:24.272
You scared me.

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:26.107
What's wrong? Are you sick?

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.275
[SYND]
No fair...

00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:32.738
It wasn't real!

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.782
Ya find somethin', Mister?

00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:36.951
Well, we'll see soon enough.

00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:43.499
What? This can't be right.

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.293
[SYND yells]

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.211
You're acting weird, Synd.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.504
Are you feeling bad?

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.299
[SYND yelling]

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.341
What happened?

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:54.510
I dunno, the big guy just
started flippin' out!

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:56.220
[SYND yells]

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.097
I can't breathe!

00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.473
Hey Chopper.

00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:01.434
He says he's havin'
a hard time breathin'.

00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:02.768
Think you can you help him?

00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:04.895
Mocha!

00:10:06.897 --> 00:10:10.026
Children! What's the matter?

00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:11.402
Dolan, too?

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:14.155
All of a sudden, the big kids
are droppin' like flies!

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:15.364
Any idea why?

00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:17.033
Chopper, you find anything?

00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:18.075
Please tell us!

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:20.786
I guess the kids really
were sick, huh?

00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:21.912
You're wrong.

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:22.913
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Huh?

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:26.167
Synd, is there something
that you want right now?

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.878
What do you usually
do this time of day?

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:31.297
This time of day?

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:32.465
[grunts]

00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:33.883
Well, I, uh...

00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:37.053
I have a check-up. After that...

00:10:37.094 --> 00:10:38.929
Go on. What happens next?

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:40.723
[SYND grunts]

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.768
I get... some candy.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:44.935
Candy?

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:46.896
[GIRL H]
It's the best ever.

00:10:46.937 --> 00:10:49.607
Everyone loves it
'cause it's super yummy.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:52.443
It is!
And it's a lot of fun, too!

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:53.361
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
What?

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:54.945
Yeah, 'cause smoke
comes out of it!

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:56.864
It's really cool, y'know?

[SYND grunts]

00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:00.451
Maybe that's what I need.

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:06.707
When I eat it I feel happy.

00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:12.797
So if I have some candy,
then I might feel better.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.095
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
What was your name? Brownbeard?

00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:21.263
Do you know anything about this?

00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:22.223
[BROWNBEARD]
Huh?

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:23.265
These children.

00:11:23.307 --> 00:11:24.975
They're not sick after all!

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.519
What're you saying?

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.145
I'm never in the lab.

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:30.022
I don't know what goes on here.

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:31.941
But I do know this.

00:11:31.982 --> 00:11:35.277
These youngsters are suffering
from an incurable disease!

00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:36.987
[USOPP]
It's all right. Stay with us!

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:38.155
Hey, Chopper!

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:41.325
The smaller ones are
startin' to break down, too!

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.244
So this "Master."

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:44.870
What's he doing to these kids?

00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:46.539
What are you implying?

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.501
He would never do anything
to hurt these children!

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.420
The Master is merciful.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.797
He went out of his way
to bring them here.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:57.007
And he did it because
he hoped to find a cure

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.843
for their disease!

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:01.178
He's a scientist of love!

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.304
[ALLY]
I can't breathe!

00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:03.514
[BOY I]
Ally?

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:04.849
[ALLY coughs]

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.642
[BROWNBEARD] Just look at
what you've done to them!

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:09.061
They're suffering because
they left the laboratory.

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:11.063
If they'd been able to get
their daily treatment,

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:12.815
they would be fine right now.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:13.899
No way!

00:12:13.941 --> 00:12:16.110
What's wrong?
What did you find out?

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.488
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
NHC10.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.116
I detected it in
their sweat samples.

00:12:23.784 --> 00:12:27.329
It's only a trace
amount, but still.

00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:28.873
This is a stimulant!

00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:32.418
They've been drugged?

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.754
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
'Fraid so. They aren't sick.

00:12:34.795 --> 00:12:38.382
They're going through
NHC10 withdrawals.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:40.176
Only a select group of doctors

00:12:40.217 --> 00:12:42.261
from chosen countries
are allowed to use it.

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.889
I know because Dr. Kureha
was one of them.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.849
While it's helpful
in curing diseases,

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:50.144
it's used sparingly because
it's highly addictive.

00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:52.229
From what I can tell
from my research,

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.939
the kids have been
consuming small amounts

00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:55.900
of it each and every day,

00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:58.569
and they've slowly
become dependent on it.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.113
If they go without it,
they crave another dose

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:05.242
to ease the pain
of their withdrawals.

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:07.244
Who would do this?

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:09.663
And to children!

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:13.626
Your master's responsible for
this, isn't he?

00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:16.712
If he's a "savior," then why'd
he drug them?!

00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:18.464
Was it so they can't escape?!

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.216
What the hell does
he want with them?!

00:13:20.257 --> 00:13:21.383
Watch your mouth.

00:13:21.425 --> 00:13:23.803
Insult the Master and
I'll make you pay!

00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:25.429
Chopper! What now?

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:27.681
The kids keep collapsing!

00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:28.891
Candy...

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.893
[grunts]

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.269
You want candy?

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.896
Okay, do you want
me to go get some

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:34.980
from the lab for you?

00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:36.232
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
No!

00:13:36.273 --> 00:13:37.483
As much as they want it,

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.276
we can't let 'em
have it anymore!

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:40.736
That's where it came from!

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:42.404
They were unaware
that they were ingesting

00:13:42.446 --> 00:13:44.782
the drug because it
was hidden in the candy!

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.409
[SYND]
You've gotta help me, Straw Hat.

00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:49.620
I really need a piece of candy.

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.205
Are you gonna get it for me?

00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:52.540
Sorry, but I can't.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.500
Chopper's the doctor of my crew.

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.877
I trust him--
whatever he says goes.

00:13:56.877 --> 00:13:58.295
So I can't do it!

00:13:58.337 --> 00:13:59.672
No fair!

00:13:59.713 --> 00:14:04.385
[crying]

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:08.180
[SYND panting]

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:21.110
[SYND whimpering]

00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:24.905
[CHILDREN whimpering]

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:35.749
[SYND]
Why?

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.253
Why?!

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.299
His eyes! What's wrong with him?

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.675
Scary!

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:49.638
Meanie!
You said you'd get it for me!

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.432
Just do it already!

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.686
[SYND grunts]

00:14:55.728 --> 00:15:01.442
You said you were gonna get it!
Go get my candy!

00:15:01.442 --> 00:15:03.444
[yelling]

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:06.614
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)]
Whoa!

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.365
Where is the boy's
strength coming from?

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:09.408
[LUFFY grunts]

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.119
Stop, Synd! Calm down!

00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:13.412
Something's way wrong!

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:15.247
I've never seen him
like this before!

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:18.417
[SYND yells]

00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:37.978
Damn, that kid is strong!

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.271
[USOPP]
Well, of course he is!

00:15:39.313 --> 00:15:41.148
What did you expect
from a giant?

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.483
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)]
But he's just a kid!

00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:45.027
Why can't I have my candy?!

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:46.028
[GROUP yells]

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.822
No!
He's not a giant, Mister!

00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:51.200
All of us used
to be normal-size.

00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:53.869
At least till we came
to this island.

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:55.496
[BOY I] I thought maybe
our disease made us

00:15:55.537 --> 00:15:56.705
grow too much.

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:59.416
'Cause that's the only
thing wrong with us!

00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:01.210
There are plenty
of strange diseases,

00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:04.171
but not one capable of
changing someone's size.

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:06.423
Giants aren't made,
they're born that way!

00:16:06.423 --> 00:16:09.843
Our bodies get bigger and bigger
the longer we stay here.

00:16:09.885 --> 00:16:13.013
Why's this happening to us?

00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:15.057
No way.

00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:16.558
That means their
size wasn't caused

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.894
by hypersecretion
of growth hormone.

00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:21.063
But then what could it be?

00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:22.231
Need candy!

00:16:22.272 --> 00:16:24.066
Candy!

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:25.776
They're using these kids...

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.405
...as test subjects!

00:16:29.446 --> 00:16:30.614
[ALLY]
Candy!

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:34.576
Calm down, Ally,
it's gonna be okay!

00:16:34.618 --> 00:16:36.161
Give it to me!

00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:37.454
[CHOPPER (SANJI) grunts]

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:45.129
[CHOPPER (SANJI)] What is this
"Master" guy trying to do?

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:46.797
They're innocent children!

00:16:46.797 --> 00:16:48.841
What kind of monster
would drug them?!

00:16:48.882 --> 00:16:51.176
[BOY G]
Candy!

00:16:51.218 --> 00:16:53.220
Now the other kids
are losin' it, too!

00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:55.639
[CHILDREN yelling]

00:17:00.227 --> 00:17:02.104
We can't fight back--
we could hurt them!

00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:03.313
[CHILDREN yelling]

00:17:06.483 --> 00:17:07.526
Nami!

00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:10.529
[SYND yelling]

00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:12.823
No, Synd!
Don't throw it, please!

00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:14.241
I'll fight the big guy!

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:16.660
[USOPP] No, you won't!
Get outta my way, Luffy!

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.704
Careful!
Don't hurt the children!

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:19.997
Oh, come on!

00:17:19.997 --> 00:17:23.625
I know! Special Attack...
Sleep Star!

00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:51.862
[USOPP]
That worked like a charm!

00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:53.280
They're sound asleep.

00:18:00.537 --> 00:18:01.705
Poor kids.

00:18:01.705 --> 00:18:04.583
I had a feeling that
they'd been kidnapped.

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.752
We need you to help
us get outta here!

00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:09.880
I wanna go home and see
my mommy and daddy again!

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:14.301
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
Luffy.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.220
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.180
[CHOPPER (SANJI)] I can't
imagine the pain these children

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:20.682
are dealing with right now.

00:18:20.724 --> 00:18:22.476
Knowing what they've
been through,

00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:24.144
it breaks my heart!

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:25.938
They said they wanna go home!

00:18:25.979 --> 00:18:27.898
They wanna see their parents.

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:29.775
We've gotta do something!

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:31.693
Yeah! I agree!

00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:33.862
We're the only ones
who can save them!

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:35.572
[LUFFY]
Hmm... Okay.

00:18:35.572 --> 00:18:37.366
Let's put 'em on the ship
and take 'em home.

00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:38.408
No problem!

00:18:38.408 --> 00:18:40.410
Come on!
That's never gonna happen!

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.496
We can't just waltz
outta here, y'know!

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:43.539
That's true.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.625
Besides, our theory
is speculation.

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:48.627
So we can't be
certain of anything

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.587
until we meet who's responsible.

00:18:50.587 --> 00:18:52.881
Oh, yeah, the "Master."

00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:54.091
[sighs]

00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:55.592
It's bad timing, though.

00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:58.262
Half the crew's looking
for that samurai.

00:18:58.262 --> 00:18:59.263
Well--

00:19:00.597 --> 00:19:01.682
It's fine.

00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:05.519
I'm sure they'll
figure something out.

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.896
We can all go to
the lab on our own.

00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:10.357
Luffy, I'm staying here.

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:11.984
I wish I could go.

00:19:12.025 --> 00:19:15.070
I'm so angry about what
he's done to these children,

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:18.699
and I really wanna
kick his butt!

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.450
But... I can't leave 'em.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:21.869
The kids need me.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.120
I'll protect them.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.413
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
I should stay, too!

00:19:24.454 --> 00:19:26.123
We can't leave
Chopper here alone!

00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:28.041
Whatever! Admit it!

00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:29.293
You're scared, huh?

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:32.754
Wait, you guys'll be in trouble
if they start rampagin' again.

00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:33.964
Big time.

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:43.140
[LUFFY] All right, that should
keep these giants in check.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.975
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
I feel kinda bad about this.

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:46.101
Get over it.

00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:48.270
These kids're huge--
they could crush you!

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:51.023
Yeah, and we have no idea
when they're gonna wake up.

00:19:51.064 --> 00:19:53.442
I'm not so sure
we should split up.

00:19:53.483 --> 00:19:54.902
Think about it.

00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:57.112
If we want Trafalgar
to switch us back,

00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:59.281
we'll have to be together
when we see him.

00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:01.366
At least, I assume
that's how it works.

00:20:01.408 --> 00:20:03.702
What's the big deal?
Stay like this!

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:06.288
That's easy for you to say!
You're still in your own body!

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:11.418
[BROWNBEARD] The Master
wouldn't harm children--

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.170
he's a warm-hearted savior.

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:17.966
You'll always have
my allegiance, Master.

00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:28.393
[BROOK] Hello? Mr. Samurai?
Where are you?

00:20:28.435 --> 00:20:30.354
[ZORO] You'd think his wooden
clogs would leave tracks

00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:32.397
in the snow.

00:20:32.439 --> 00:20:34.441
[SANJI (NAMI)]
So heavy!

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:36.360
My boobs are so
heavy that they bounce

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.736
whenever I run!

00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.780
Get it together! Do you want
to save that samurai

00:20:39.821 --> 00:20:40.656
or not?!

00:20:40.697 --> 00:20:41.865
[SANJI (NAMI) yelps]

00:20:42.824 --> 00:20:44.743
So romantic!

00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:46.995
[BOTH]
Huh? [yell]

00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:50.415
No! The only reason I caught you
is 'cause you're in Nami's body!

00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:51.625
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Then why'd you drop me?

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:53.627
Now she's gonna
be all bruised up!

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:56.713
You guys aren't going to believe
what I've found over here!

00:20:56.713 --> 00:20:59.883
Look! It's a footprint!

00:20:59.883 --> 00:21:01.426
You think it's the samurai's?

00:21:01.468 --> 00:21:02.886
[BROOK]
I don't think it's human.

00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:05.138
Well, then it must be
a centaur footprint.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.558
[BROOK]
Uh... No...

00:21:08.558 --> 00:21:11.395
This is... way too big.

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:16.525
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Shurororororo!

00:21:18.735 --> 00:21:21.280
The heart of the
leader of the G-5.

00:21:21.321 --> 00:21:24.533
Vice Admiral Smoker.

00:21:24.574 --> 00:21:28.578
What a wonderful souvenir.
Thanks.

00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:30.414
With this, the fight is over.

00:21:35.585 --> 00:21:37.921
Shurorororo!

00:21:39.756 --> 00:21:42.467
Now that the G-5
has lost their warship,

00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:44.136
they're bound
to attempt to steal ours

00:21:44.177 --> 00:21:46.513
in order to make a report.

00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:49.599
Of course,
I've got men lying in wait.

00:21:52.602 --> 00:21:54.688
[LAW]
What about the Straw Hat crew?

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.773
[CAESAR CLOWN]
No need to worry about them.

00:21:56.773 --> 00:22:00.777
I have a plan to get rid of them
and retrieve the children.

00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:04.364
Watch. Those brats
will beg to come back.

00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:06.616
We won't even
have to lift a finger.

00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:08.118
You'll see.

00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:09.328
[LAW]
Huh?

00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:11.580
[CAESAR CLOWN] I didn't think
much of the Straw Hats,

00:22:11.621 --> 00:22:14.833
that is, until Monet
warned me about them.

00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:17.294
It might be overkill,
but I'm sending those two

00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:19.004
after their crew.

00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:19.963
That's right!

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:23.050
The men known as the
Snow Mountain Assassins!

00:22:23.091 --> 00:22:25.302
They never miss their target!

00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:30.432
[CAESAR CLOWN]
My loyal minions.

00:22:30.474 --> 00:22:33.477
The Yeti Cool Brothers.

00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:39.107
[ROCK]
There are six more of them.

00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:40.400
[SCOTCH]
The way he talked 'em up,

00:22:40.442 --> 00:22:42.944
I thought they were
gonna be a lot stronger.

00:22:42.986 --> 00:22:45.280
It should be easy
to finish 'em off.

00:22:47.574 --> 00:22:49.242
[ROCK]
We'll take 'em down.

00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:51.119
Just like those other three.

00:22:53.163 --> 00:22:55.665
And we'll do it in a cool way.

00:23:17.813 --> 00:23:20.023
[NARRATOR] Luffy and friends
rush to the laboratory

00:23:20.023 --> 00:23:22.692
to find the master
while Nami and Chopper

00:23:22.692 --> 00:23:24.778
stay behind to look
after the children.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.906
But hidden assassins
soon target them.

00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:30.742
Just as Luffy realizes
something is amiss,

00:23:30.784 --> 00:23:33.745
the two find themselves
in grave danger.

00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:35.330
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.372 --> 00:23:39.626
"To Annihilate the Straw Hats!
Legendary Assassins Descend!"

00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:42.421
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
