These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

Gold Roger and his crew

chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

For the rest of the

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.253
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

In order to defeat one of the

Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:27.447
Luffy had intended to
win a tournament that

00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:29.720
promised the Flame Flame
Fruit to the champion,

00:03:29.753 --> 00:03:33.126
but abandoned that plan when
Law was captured by Doflamingo.

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.631
Now, he rushes to
the palace to save him.

Hold on. What's with that sword?

00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:36.994
The blade isn't
even sharp, is it?

00:06:37.027 --> 00:06:40.033
In this coliseum,
we fight to the death.

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:42.037
If you won't shed
the blood of others,

you'll pay with your own.

Do you happen to know how

Why would Master Trebol

Did we just get crushed
by a big duck?

There's no time to explain now.

We have a problem here.

00:17:25.456 --> 00:17:27.460
My forces are ready to fight.

00:17:27.494 --> 00:17:30.066
I can handle this myself.

00:17:30.099 --> 00:17:32.236
I've waited long enough!

00:17:33.472 --> 00:17:36.111
[REBECCA] Our hopes have been
dropped from heaven to hell.

00:17:36.144 --> 00:17:38.115
The fighters can't
take this anymore.

00:17:38.149 --> 00:17:39.952
Their spirits are broken!

00:17:43.492 --> 00:17:47.634
All we can do now is
wait 'til the day we die.

00:17:50.072 --> 00:17:53.714
They say they'll release us
if we survive a thousand times.

00:17:53.747 --> 00:17:55.718
But how is that
supposed to give us hope?

00:17:55.751 --> 00:17:57.420
It's just more misery!

00:17:57.453 --> 00:18:01.596
"The gladiator Kyros won
all 3,000 of his matches."

00:18:01.629 --> 00:18:02.998
But that's just
a stupid legend--

00:18:03.032 --> 00:18:04.936
No one even remembers him!

00:18:04.969 --> 00:18:07.306
Kyros was probably made up
by a bunch of prisoners

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.146
who were holding on to
a dream of being free.

00:18:10.179 --> 00:18:11.883
But he's just a statue.

00:18:11.916 --> 00:18:14.722
A perfect warrior who
could never really exist.

00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:19.899
I'm sick of dreaming an
impossible dream, so I'll fight!

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:23.005
The competition today
is my one chance!

00:18:23.038 --> 00:18:23.907
So I'm taking it!

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.544
It's a suicide mission!

00:18:25.577 --> 00:18:28.550
We're not talking about
a typical gladiator match!

00:18:28.584 --> 00:18:30.120
You'll end up dead!

00:18:30.153 --> 00:18:32.290
I forbid you to enter!

00:18:32.323 --> 00:18:33.960
You are not thinking straight!

00:18:33.993 --> 00:18:35.429
You are only 16.

00:18:35.462 --> 00:18:39.104
Rebecca, I simply know
better than you. Trust me!

00:18:39.137 --> 00:18:41.074
You're not an adult yet!

00:18:41.108 --> 00:18:43.579
You don't know
what's good for you!

00:18:45.584 --> 00:18:48.790
Oh, shut up! Stop acting
like you're my father!

00:18:49.826 --> 00:18:52.732
You are the one who's
not thinking straight here!

00:18:52.765 --> 00:18:54.301
"You can handle this"?

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:57.641
I don't know what your plan is,
but you can't beat Doflamingo!

00:18:57.674 --> 00:18:58.877
Look at yourself!

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.649
You're just a broken toy
with one leg!

00:19:09.464 --> 00:19:10.867
[gasps]

00:19:11.903 --> 00:19:15.442
Of course. You're right.

00:19:16.444 --> 00:19:19.050
[gasps] Wait!

00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:22.757
I'm sorry for being
so meddlesome.

00:19:22.791 --> 00:19:25.797
But if you can,
please do not fight.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:30.139
Soldier! We can talk!
Just come back!

00:19:30.172 --> 00:19:33.547
Soldier, please!
Don't leave like this!

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.749
I'm scared!

00:19:34.782 --> 00:19:37.454
I didn't want you to
sacrifice yourself, okay?

00:19:37.487 --> 00:19:40.326
That's all! I'm sorry!

00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:42.932
I'm just so worried about you!

00:19:42.965 --> 00:19:45.503
Please come back!

00:19:54.689 --> 00:19:56.792
That's not just my legs!

00:19:57.762 --> 00:19:59.898
Pica must be moving.

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:02.571
I wonder if he's dealing
with someone as well.

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:07.581
[DAIKON]
You stay right here!

00:20:07.614 --> 00:20:09.317
[CUB]
Are you all right, Commander?

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.921
Yes, thank you.

00:20:10.954 --> 00:20:11.989
We gotta move.

00:20:12.023 --> 00:20:14.762
Hold on! They'll be hurt
if we don't help them!

00:20:14.796 --> 00:20:17.768
[LAO G] Get your paws off me,
you little bastards!

00:20:17.802 --> 00:20:20.707
Stop looking back,
Commander! Just go!

00:20:21.676 --> 00:20:24.782
We're ready. We all knew
what we signed up for.

00:20:24.815 --> 00:20:26.085
Don't say that!

00:20:26.118 --> 00:20:28.890
If you stay here,
then everyone might die!

00:20:29.992 --> 00:20:34.167
Even if Leo pulls off Operation
S.O.P., it's still not over.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.105
If we let Doflamingo walk away,

00:20:36.138 --> 00:20:38.275
he can do the same
thing all over again.

00:20:38.308 --> 00:20:39.177
Or even worse!

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.181
No one else can beat Doflamingo!

00:20:41.215 --> 00:20:44.588
We're counting on you
for that! Keep fighting!

00:20:47.995 --> 00:20:50.600
[USOPP] Is the commander
really such a big deal, Leo?

00:20:50.634 --> 00:20:54.307
I dunno, seems kinda crazy
to bet everything on one guy.

00:20:56.244 --> 00:20:58.850
[DWARF D] As long as
the commander makes it.

00:20:58.884 --> 00:21:01.956
[DWARF E]
It doesn't matter if we die.

00:21:01.989 --> 00:21:05.329
Why do you trust him so much?
He's just a one-legged toy!

00:21:05.362 --> 00:21:08.937
Normally, when Sugar
turns someone into a toy,

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.308
they're bound by
the contract she makes.

00:21:11.341 --> 00:21:13.479
Meaning, they can't disobey.

00:21:13.513 --> 00:21:16.184
That's why they're able to
keep them all as slaves.

00:21:16.217 --> 00:21:18.790
But unlike them,
the commander's free.

00:21:18.824 --> 00:21:21.361
He was the first one here
to be transformed.

00:21:21.395 --> 00:21:24.935
So that time, when Sugar
used her Hobby-Hobby power,

00:21:24.968 --> 00:21:29.778
she made a mistake and forgot
to form a contract with him.

00:21:30.948 --> 00:21:33.653
[LEO] One little error
from more than ten years ago

00:21:33.686 --> 00:21:36.559
gave them a powerful
enemy like none other.

00:21:36.592 --> 00:21:39.230
He's the only toy in this
kingdom who can strike back

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:41.503
at the Don Quixote Family.

00:21:41.536 --> 00:21:44.207
A toy who can take
revenge for them all.

00:21:46.746 --> 00:21:49.818
[LEO] For a whole decade
he's been fighting on his own,

00:21:49.852 --> 00:21:52.891
but he never gave up,
and he never lost hope.

00:21:54.226 --> 00:21:56.231
He knew the truth
about the toys,

00:21:56.264 --> 00:21:58.570
and how much
they were suffering.

00:21:58.603 --> 00:22:01.508
Slaving away and forgotten.

00:22:02.812 --> 00:22:06.886
[LEO] In time, all of our people
would've been enslaved as well.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.388
But thanks to him...

00:22:09.892 --> 00:22:13.131
[LEO]
...now we're able to fight back!

00:22:17.508 --> 00:22:20.914
If he calls us to arms,
we have to answer!

00:22:20.947 --> 00:22:24.320
Otherwise, this kingdom
is as good as dead!

00:22:28.495 --> 00:22:29.732
He's worth it!

00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:32.737
We're proud to bet
everything we've got on him!

00:22:36.044 --> 00:22:39.150
[LEO] Nobody remembers him now,
but years ago,

00:22:39.183 --> 00:22:41.989
everyone in the kingdom
knew who he was.

00:22:43.425 --> 00:22:45.864
[LEO] Before he got
transformed into a toy,

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:47.399
his name was...

00:22:47.433 --> 00:22:48.903
...Kyros!

00:22:50.172 --> 00:22:51.809
[LEO]
He was the strongest gladiator

00:22:51.842 --> 00:22:54.347
that the coliseum had ever seen!

00:22:56.017 --> 00:22:57.921
That's who our commander is!

00:22:57.954 --> 00:23:00.259
A legendary hero!

00:23:15.022 --> 00:23:17.093
[NARRATOR] The Toy Soldier
dashes through the palace

00:23:17.126 --> 00:23:18.763
to face off with Doflamingo,

00:23:18.796 --> 00:23:21.702
then a fearsome foe named
Gladius appears in his path.

00:23:21.736 --> 00:23:23.706
Overwhelmed by his
explosive strength,

00:23:23.739 --> 00:23:26.110
the Toy Soldier soon
finds his life in peril.

00:23:26.144 --> 00:23:27.748
When all hope seems lost,

00:23:27.781 --> 00:23:30.687
suddenly, Luffy rushes in
like the wind!

00:23:30.721 --> 00:23:32.490
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.524 --> 00:23:35.830
"The Rupture Man!
Gladius Blows Up Big Time!"

00:23:35.863 --> 00:23:38.736
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
