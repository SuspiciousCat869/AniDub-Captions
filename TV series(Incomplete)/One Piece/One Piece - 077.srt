00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,460
But you have to help!

179
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,129
Those were the boss's orders...

180
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,933
[BON CLAY]
Un... deux... trois...

181
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,835
Uh, what's "four" again...?

182
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,137
Anybody?

183
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,438
[sighs]

184
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,907
That 0... So much trouble.

185
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:44,450
[NAMI]
Vivi... I'm sorry, but, I...

186
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,859
[NAMI]
I need to rest.

187
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,428
I understand, Nami...!

188
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,496
Don't worry,
everything's under control.

189
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,966
I'll keep an eye on our course.

190
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,500

00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,706
You're burning up!

193
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,975
Hey, everyone...! Come quick!

194
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,042
[ZORO]
Huh?

195
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,510
What's wrong, Vivi?

196
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,211
Are you okay?!

197
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,879
[VIVI]
Nami has an awful fever!

198
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,450
What...?! Nami's sick?!

199
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:23,489
[NAMI pants]

200
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,696
[USOPP]
Huh...?

201
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,401
It's most likely the climate...
It's quite normal...

202
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,569
See... Sailors in the
Grand Line aren't used

203
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,706
to the strange weather
and can become quite ill...

204
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,242
There are countless stories
of tough, notorious pirates

205
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,677
who suddenly died.

206
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,079
Their immune systems
were attacked and ravaged

207
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,448
by colds and fevers.

208
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,851
Ignoring the symptoms can make
even the slightest cold deadly.

209
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,420
[whimpers]

210
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,588
[SANJI]
Nami!

211
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:30,756
Is there anyone aboard this ship

212
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:34,260
with even the slightest
amount of medical experience?

213
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,368
Well... when you're sick eating
lots of meat always helps

214
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,269
Right, Sanji?

215
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,470
Huh? Meat is protein

216
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,107
and that does give the body
energy to operate properly...

217
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,875
I can cook some foods
that'll boost her energy,

218
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,210
but there's no guarantees.

219
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,812
I'm not a doctor.

220
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,314
Besides, if my cooking
made that big a difference,

221
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,549
she'd never get sick.

222
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,151
I put a hundred times more
care into preparing her meals

223
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,153
than I do for you losers.

224
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,788
I serve Nami fresh meats
and vegetables

225
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,790
to ensure a balanced diet...

226
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,293
Anything that's
rotten or moldy...

227
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,294
...goes to you.

228
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:08,994
Jerk!

229
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,830
Oh well,
still tastes good to me!

230
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,098
[laughs]

231
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,901
[sighs] My point is that as
long as I'm this ship's cook,

232
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,138
nobody's gonna feed Nami
better in terms of nutrition.

233
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,673
I can do anything
in the kitchen...

234
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,476
Still... I do know that
there are specific foods

235
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,478
for different
kinds of illnesses,

236
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,146
but I can't make that call.

237
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,814
She needs to be
diagnosed by a doctor

238
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,483
who will tell us
how to help her.

239
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,319
Just... feed her
everything that we've got.

240
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,453
Oh, shut up...

241
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,288
She doesn't have
the energy to eat.

242
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,858
She's sick...

243
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,659
Ah! One hundred four!

244
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,294
No, this isn't good...

245
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,330
There's bound to be doctors
and nurses in Alabasta

246
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,631
that can help, right?!

247
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,434
How much longer
till we get there, Vivi?

248
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,535
[VIVI]
I don't know.

249
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,304
At least a week,
and that's too long!

250
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,339
'Kay, so she's sick.

251
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,840
Maybe we're overreacting.

252
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,543
I don't know.
I've never been this sick.

253
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,379
Morons! Have you
all lost your minds?!

254
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,647
This is serious!

255
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,315
She shouldn't have
such a high fever

256
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,684
unless her body's
fighting an infection!

257
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,786
This is bad...

258
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,321
Whatever's wrong,
it's possibly life‐threatening.

259
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,723
Ahhh!

260
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,793
You mean Nami's gonna die?!

261
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,197
Your screams aren't helping!

262
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,700
We have to find a doctor
to help Nami before she dies!

263
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,536
Okay! Everyone just calm down!

264
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,704
You're only going to
make her feel worse...

265
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:26,405
Listen.

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,375

I'm fine.

00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:32,878
Nami?

270
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,647
Yay! She's cured!

271
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,881

00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,321
Go to my desk,
open the second drawer...

00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,557
There's a newspaper
in the bottom.

275
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,397
No change... in our course.

00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,533
[VIVI]
No!

277
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,402
That's not possible!

278
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,403
Huh...? What's up?

279
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,237
Something wrong?

280
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,538
Is it about Alabasta?

281
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,773
Tell us!

282
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,943
According to this article, three
hundred thousand royal soldiers

283
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,278
have defected to the Resistance.

284
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,550
Until now, we've been
embroiled in a cold war,

285
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,452
with six hundred thousand
royal soldiers against

286
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,254
four hundred thousand rebels...

287
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,923

the balance has shifted!

289
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,927
The uprising in Alabasta
will seriously escalate now.

00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,629
Things'll get ugly.

291
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,799
That paper you're looking
at is three days old.

292
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,634
I'm sorry I didn't
say something earlier.

293
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,437
We can't change our speed,
so I didn't want to worry you...

294
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,806
There's nothing anyone
can do right now.

295
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,774
You understand... Luffy?

00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,809
[LUFFY]
Hmm...

297
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,578
Things are bad, and
they're beyond our control!

298
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,880
[NAMI] That sunk in
better than I'd hoped.

299
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:41,714
Nami, look...

300
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,949
You need to see
a doctor right away!

301
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:44,950
I'm fine...

302
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,418
That thermometer's broken...

303
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,286
I mean, come on,

304
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,622
nobody gets a
temperature of 104...

305
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,625
It's probably just a
mild case of sunstroke.

306
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,661
There's nothing a doctor
can do for me that time won't.

307
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,596
Besides we don't have
time to hunt for one.

308
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,399
We need to head straight
for Alabasta, right?

309
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,902
I appreciate the concern...

310
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,603
Thank you.

00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,478
Huh, she sure recovered fast...

312
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,413
No... She's faking.

has escalated,

more blood will be shed
throughout the kingdom...

00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,663
We're at war.

317
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,097
If I don't put a stop
to this insanity,

318
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,334
the entire Kingdom of
Alabasta will be doomed...!

319
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,337
Crocodile will move in
and seize control!

You're trying to get me home
safely, but there's no time...!

321
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,343
I need to get home
as quickly as possible!

If I don't make it back in time,

00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,014
a million innocent citizens will
give their lives needlessly!

324
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,849
There's a million people there?!

00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:51,850
Wow!

I don't need to look at it...

337
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,982
I've been using that big cloud
over there as my guide.

You moron, clouds move

Ow! Jeez, my head's killing me.

340
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,923
So leave the navigating

[ZORO]
Shut up and get moving...!

356
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,916
Take the seat and
catch the portside wind!

357
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,084
[SANJI]
Nami, what's up...?

358
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,085
It's a perfect day.

359
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,522
The sun is shining,
the waves are quiet...

360
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,858
[NAMI]
The wind...

361
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:06,925
Wind?

362
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,727
There's a powerful wind...

363
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,629
It's heading right this way.

364
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,564
I think.

365
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,799
Luffy...?

366
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,933
You're head's on fire!

367
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,035
You gotta stay in bed!

368
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,870
And we need to get you a doctor!

369
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,571
Maybe you should mind
your own business.

370
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,572
This is my normal temperature!

371
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,475
Now quit being so stupid
and pull the damn ropes!

372
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,978
Nami... I know you're
acting brave for Vivi,

373
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:26,912
but if you keep pushing,

374
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,781
your body won't have
a chance to heal!

375
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:29,948
Quack.

376
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,450
I told you guys I'm fine!

377
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,818
Let it go!

378
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:37,956
Whoa... Hey...

379
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,625
Take it easy.

380
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,826
Not another word, dammit!

381
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,461
Hurry and move the ship!

382
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,629
[SANJI]
Right, we're on it.

383
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:44,963
[USOPP]
You got it.

384
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,670
Sheesh...

385
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,806
Something... I don't know...

386
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,476
But something's headed
this way... and soon.

387
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,811
[ZORO grunts]

388
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,772
Huh?

389
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,680
[VIVI] I need to get home...
before time runs out.

390
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,851
[VIVI]
I have to ask you all a favor!

391
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,554
As a passenger on your ship,
it's not my place to ask this,

392
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,189
but I have no choice...

393
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,358
My homeland is in
jeopardy of being destroyed.

394
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,860
So I would
really appreciate it,

395
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,862
if we could move even faster...

396
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,063
Every minute I'm out here,

397
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,199
puts more of my people in
danger of losing their lives.

398
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:58,137
We need to head for
Alabasta at full speed!

399
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,209
Of course, we will...

400
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,345
Just like we promised.

401
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,484
Then it's settled.

402
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,553
Let's find an island with
a doctor on it right away!

403
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:15,087
Huh?

404
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,054
First thing's first...

405
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,490
We need to hurry and
get Nami healthy again.

406
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,725
Then we head for Alabasta!

407
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,895
After all, we need her at the
helm to move at top speed...

408
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:23,762
Right...!

409
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,498
No one makes this
ship move like Nami!

410
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,900
Princess... Hold on.

411
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,701
Won't finding a doctor
for Nami take time

412
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,237
the citizens of Alabasta
just don't have?

413
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,071
That's right!

414
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,339
So the sooner we
get Nami a doctor,

415
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,442
the sooner we can
get to Alabasta!

416
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,444
Those are wise words, Vivi...!

417
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,713
You're beautiful and brilliant!

418
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,716
The girl's got guts.

419
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,185
Thank you, Vivi.

420
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,120
Don't overexert yourself, Nami!

421
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,292
I'm... uh...

422
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,593
I'm sorry...

423
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,862
I may need to lie down...

424
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:57,629
[VIVI]
Nami!

425
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,532
What the hell is that?!

426
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,434
[VIVI]
It's a cyclone!

427
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,436
[LUFFY]
It's huge!

428
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,306
Wait! That's the same
path we were headed on!

429
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,908
[SANJI] Vivi's right...!
That's the exact same direction!

430
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,944
It would've been a direct hit
if we'd kept goin' straight!

431
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,279
We'd be dead right now!

432
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,422
See that...?!

433
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,623
Way too close...!

434
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,458
We barely missed it!

435
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,593
[VIVI]
Incredible!

436
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,294
Cyclones in the
Grand Line are said

437
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,230
to be impossible to predict...!

438
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,298
Yet, somehow Nami did!

439
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,833
However she does it,
it's obvious her technique

440
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,402
isn't based on any
conventional method...

441
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,505
It's as if she's detecting
the weather with her body!

442
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,241
It's beyond reason...!

443
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,642
A miracle!

444
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:44,643
All right!

445
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,478
What are we waiting here for?!

446
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,981
Let's find Nami a doctor!

447
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,649
[CREW]
Yeah!

449
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,502
[SANJI] Ah!
What're we gonna do, Vivi?!

450
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,371
Nami's fever won't go down!

451
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,005
[KAROO]
Quack!

452
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,640
Hey, guys... Stop.

453
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,476
That behavior isn't helping!

454
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,818
[LUFFY]
See any doctors yet?!

455
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,021
Luffy, you can't be serious.

456
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,992
Uh, hey, guys...

457
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,728
What do you think about
people standing on water...

458
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,630
What‐‐do I think it's possible?

459
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:39,965
What kind of question is that?

460
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,533
It's impossible, of course!

461
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,001
Yeah...?

462
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,870
Well, then... what's that?

463
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,371
What's what?

464
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,373
