00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.757
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.693
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.820
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:36.222
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.925
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:43.596
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.165
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:48.868
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:53.006
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.077
[NARRATOR] The first stop on
Luffy's journey to the New World

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:01.848
is Fishman Island, thousands
of feet below sea level,

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:05.151
where his crew becomes
involved in a civil war.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.853
Meeting Jimbei
in the Sea Forest,

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.656
they learn of the events
that led to the conflict.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.192
He tells a tale
of the Fishman Pirates,

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:16.930
the island's brave queen,
and its hero, Fisher Tiger.

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:26.906
[LUFFY] "Back to the Present!
Hordy Makes a Move!"

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.485
[ALL crying]

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.784
Wait, Jimbei!

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:15.121
What kind of scum would
assassinate our queen?

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:16.990
[FISHMAN SOLDIER E]
Spread out and find them!

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:18.258
[FISHMAN SOLDIER F]
Turn the island upside down

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:19.525
if you have to!

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:24.631
[JIMBEI] First, Brother Tai...
now, Queen Otohime.

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:27.800
I can't. I can't!

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:34.574
[JIMBEI grunts]

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.310
[JIMBEI] How am I supposed
to live with this anger?

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:40.146
What peace can I
ever hope to find?!

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.716
No. Damn it!

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.851
[gunshots]

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:47.020
[FISHMAN SOLDIER G] There he is!
The shooter's up there!

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:48.855
[FISHMAN SOLDIER H]
Go! Get to the rooftop!

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:50.890
[JIMBEI grunts]

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:55.328
Is he the one?

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:58.498
[HORDY] I saw him with a gun
in his hand. There's no doubt.

00:04:58.531 --> 00:04:59.532
Uh?

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.934
Where is the cur?

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:05.038
Boss Jimbei! One of our
men just killed him, sir.

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.773
Was it someone we know?

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.641
Far from it.

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:14.047
It can't be!

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:17.483
[JIMBEI]
It's a human!

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:21.387
[JIMBEI grunts]

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:22.889
Hide the body!

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:24.857
[FISHMAN SOLDIER I]
Hold on. Do what?

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:26.659
[HORDY gasps]
Hm?

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:28.861
[JIMBEI]
If this gets out,

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:32.198
it'll ruin everything
the queen has accomplished!

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:35.501
All of her work
will be for nothing.

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:38.137
She'll never be
able to rest in peace!

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.609
Maybe, but that still doesn't
change the truth, does it?

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:46.746
[JIMBEI] The truth is
that he was a lawless pirate!

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.982
Pirate or no pirate, all that
matters is he was human.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.250
[gasps]

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.319
[JIMBEI]
Leave it be, Hordy!

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.421
Don't do it, damn you!

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:00.093
[HORDY]
Listen, everyone!

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:02.795
[CROWD gasping]

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.933
[HORDY]
It was a human!

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:11.037
A human assassinated our queen!

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:15.174
This is what
humans are capable of!

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:19.045
Killing in cold blood!

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.920
She trusted them
with all her heart!

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:31.157
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
A human.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.427
All she ever wanted was
a peaceful coexistence.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.396
And this human murders her

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:39.399
just when she finally
had us convinced.

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:44.537
We put all of our faith in her
and he's stolen that from us.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.973
By taking Queen Otohime's life,

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:50.710
he's taken our hearts,
and the future of this country!

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:52.478
We could kill you
a million times--

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:55.481
it'd never replace
our queen! You human!

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:58.184
Is there no justice
in the world?

00:06:58.217 --> 00:07:01.020
What joy can we find now?

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:03.089
It's more than I can take!

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:08.194
All I can see is despair!
All I can see is regret!

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:15.568
[thudding]

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.108
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Has the King agreed

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:24.444
to leave the Tower yet?

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:25.978
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Afraid not.

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:29.215
There's no reasoning with him.

00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:33.319
He's so stricken with grief
and rage, he's lost all control.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.924
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT, FISHMEN
SOLDIERS] King Neptune!

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.359
[NEPTUNE]
Lock the door behind me

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:44.664
and leave it shut until
my urge to kill has subsided!

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:51.671
--[thudding]
--[NEPTUNE grunting]

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:54.407
[NEPTUNE yells]

00:07:56.442 --> 00:08:01.447
[NEPTUNE gasping]

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:08.855
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT] King
Neptune, will you talk to me?

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:12.358
[NEPTUNE]
Hmm? I'm listening.

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:13.960
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
The shooter was discovered

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:16.195
with the gun still in his hand,

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:19.432
so one of our
soldiers killed him.

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:21.133
He was a human.

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:24.370
[NEPTUNE]
I would've torn off his limbs,

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:27.106
whether he were armed or not.

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:30.543
[NEPTUNE]
But my queen would never

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:33.679
have allowed such savagery.

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:37.350
I don't even know
when this all began,

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:41.821
but I would only perpetuate
it further by seeking revenge.

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.990
If the children of our
nation were to see me

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:48.261
engage in such acts, it would
only teach them bitterness--

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:50.696
show them that
rage is the answer

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.634
and this horrible bloodshed
would spiral onward.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:58.137
It was easy to empathize
with Otohime's message

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.108
of peace so long as it
was someone else's problem!

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:05.411
But now... why would
it be wrong for me

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:08.548
to kill the man who
shot my wife to death?

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.983
Why is that not my right?

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:15.922
As much as I want to...
I just can't understand that.

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:18.758
[NEPTUNE]
I-In my time as a soldier,

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:23.429
I took many lives in reprisal
for my fallen comrades.

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:27.633
And I've killed swarms of humans
over the years who besieged us.

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:29.669
But my hypocrisy kept me

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:32.438
from helping Otohime
in her endeavors.

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:35.875
So I simply stood
by her side and watched.

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:38.311
Why should she die

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:42.114
when a beast like me
is allowed to live?

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:44.717
I could never take over her work

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.986
because my hands
are forever stained

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:50.256
with the blood of
my brutal history.

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:51.257
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
My king,

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.693
we're all teeming
with contradictions,

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:55.962
and we all change with age.

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:59.031
That goes for Fishmen
and humans alike.

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:01.968
But there are some
things that only a soldier

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:06.339
can have the strength
to understand.

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:15.014
[door opens]

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:18.150

King Neptune!

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:22.722
[NEPTUNE panting]

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:24.824
[NEPTUNE]
Thank you for helping me.

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:26.392
I'm not certain if I'm ready,

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:30.229
but at least I can
attend my wife's funeral.

00:10:30.262 --> 00:10:31.430
[FUKABOSHI,
RYUBOSHI, MANBOSHI gasp]

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.199
Father, you made it!

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:35.001
I've missed you so much!

Welcome back.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.489
[NEPTUNE]
I'm sorry, children.

00:10:56.522 --> 00:11:00.960
I shouldn't have left you alone
during such a terrible time.

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:03.329
[SHIRAHOSHI]
You should see this, Father.

00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:06.265
[NEPTUNE]
Hmm? What is it?

00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:08.100
[SHIRAHOSHI] These letters
keep flying after me

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:09.935
no matter where I go.

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:13.406
[FUKABOSHI] She's already
received five of them, Father.

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:16.909
[NEPTUNE]
Is this... a love letter?

00:11:16.942 --> 00:11:19.078
Shirahoshi's only six-years-old!

00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:22.048
Who in blazes is
this Vander Decken?

00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:25.251
That's the name of a legendary
pirate, isn't it, Sire?

00:11:25.284 --> 00:11:30.022
[NEPTUNE] Hmm... My children
will not attend the funeral.

[GROUP gasp]

00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:32.391

There could be an accomplice

still on the loose
for all we know.

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:37.029

00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:38.090
To all my fellow Fishmen...

[TRANSPONDER SNAIL buzzes]

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:42.762
[FUKABOSHI] ...I'm sorry to
interrupt my mother's funeral,

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:45.865
but there's something
I need to tell you.

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:47.867
So I ask that you
please forgive me

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.070
and lend me your full attention.

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:53.572
In her last moment of life,

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:57.042
my mother happily spoke
to us of the future.

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:59.812
She told us that,
"We are almost there--

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:02.414
our new home in
the light of the sun."

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:05.017
We have chosen to adopt
our mother's dream

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.353
and dedicate our lives
to seeing it through.

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:10.189
No matter how long it takes.

00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:12.057
So noble.

00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:14.727
We understand that
you are not yet ready

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.898
and you likely won't be for
the World Summit in two years.

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:21.200
But there will be
another in six years

00:13:21.233 --> 00:13:24.403
and another after that in ten.

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:27.173
It's only natural for
this tragedy to have reaffirmed

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:30.176
your deeply held
mistrust of humans,

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:32.378
so I'll destroy
the remaining signatures

00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:34.280

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:40.886
And together, we'll
start from the beginning.

00:13:41.954 --> 00:13:44.089
[FUKABOSHI]
Someday in our future,

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:47.526
when your wounds have
finally begun to heal,

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.862
once you feel you are ready...

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:58.971
...united, we will dream
of a new life in the sun!

00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:27.933
[JIMBEI]
In the decade that followed,

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.969
the remaining members
of the royal family,

00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:32.771
including the King himself,
rarely left the palace

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:36.475
but chose to speak to the nation
through their monitors instead.

00:14:37.643 --> 00:14:38.777
[JIMBEI]
And all the while,

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:41.614
the islander's signatures
steadily replenished.

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:44.149
[JIMBEI]
So there you have it.

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:48.287
That's how we spent the past 16
years fighting discrimination.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.788
And that's how
the Fishman Pirates

00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:52.391
were formed and divided.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.729
There's no denying
the awful things

00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:58.898
Arlong did to your home.

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:03.602
Even so, at one time,
he was like a brother to me.

00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:10.509
[JIMBEI] When we received
news of his violent actions,

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:13.279
we took it upon
ourselves to stop him,

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:16.849
but he always managed
to dodge any real consequence.

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:18.517
He hid his actions from the Navy

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:21.887
by bribing any soldiers
that he came across.

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.823
I let him live, and
in failing to stop him,

00:15:24.857 --> 00:15:27.660
I, too, share the
guilt for his crimes.

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:32.164
[JIMBEI grunts]

00:15:32.197 --> 00:15:36.902
And that's why, though it
pains me, it's my fault.

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:42.975
Oh, yeah?

00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:45.744
If you're so sorry,
kill yourself.

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.579
[CHOPPER gasps]
Sanji.

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.715
[SANJI]
Take responsibility.

00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:52.651
Pay with your life for the
suffering that you caused her.

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:54.019
Give her peace.

00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:56.188
That's enough, Sanji!

00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:58.357
What? Are you serious, Nami?

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.459
How could you excuse
the things they did to you?

00:16:00.492 --> 00:16:02.861
[NAMI] I'll never
excuse what Arlong did!

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:05.798
But Jimbei? He never meant
for anyone to get hurt.

00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:07.866
Wait. Are you sure?

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:13.172
[JIMBEI]
I will accept any punishment.

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:15.040
If you wish for me
to take my own life--

00:16:15.074 --> 00:16:16.041
[NAMI]
Drop it!

00:16:16.075 --> 00:16:17.643
[JIMBEI grunts]

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:19.244
[NAMI]
Look. It's okay.

00:16:19.278 --> 00:16:21.413
The only one I hate is Arlong.

00:16:21.447 --> 00:16:22.982
[JIMBEI grunts]

00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:28.520
[NAMI] Believe me,
I'm relieved to hear you're

00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:31.290
not the mastermind
of the Arlong Pirates.

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:35.427
And you're a friend of Luffy's,
which tells me plenty about you.

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:36.628
I won't lie.

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:40.132
The Arlong Pirates made
my life a living hell,

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.301
but y'know if it wasn't
for that nightmare,

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:45.337
I never would've met my friends.

00:16:45.371 --> 00:16:48.607
That awful time
made me who I am.

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:54.446
I can't hate you just
'cause you're a Fishman.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.848
So you?

00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:58.784
You don't get to pity me
just because of my past.

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:04.590
I'm fine with my past, because
I'm happy in the present.

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:06.792
[JIMBEI gasps]

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.297
It doesn't matter
who did this to me.

00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:16.301
Don't become angry.
Not on my behalf.

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:20.973
Please, you can't tell
anyone on the island.

00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:25.778
The tragedy that we've endured
and our hatred must die with us!

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.113
[ALADDIN]
I wouldn't dwell on it.

00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:29.748
There's nothing
you could've done.

00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:33.085
You've known each other
since childhood, after all.

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:35.821
Like him or not, he's still
like a brother to you.

00:17:35.854 --> 00:17:37.523
And you're no killer.

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:42.061
[JIMBEI crying]

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.400
I don't deserve to
be treated so kindly.

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:53.338
You have my gratitude.

00:17:56.642 --> 00:17:59.445
[HACHI]
Nyu! Nami!

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:07.686
You're a good man, Jimbei.

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:11.924
[cries] I know how hard
it is to be a big brother!

00:18:11.957 --> 00:18:15.794
You're a helluva guy, Jimbei!

00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:19.364
That whole story!
I like 'em all so much!

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:21.266
Tiger and Otoshime
and what's-his-name.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.268
Shut yer mouth, Franky!

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.506
[NAMI] He must've been
carrying so much pain.

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:38.283
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:18:38.317 --> 00:18:39.818
[NAMI]
Luffy?

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:43.088
[LUFFY snoring]

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:44.389
[GROUP]
What?

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:47.359
[SANJI]
Moron!

00:18:47.392 --> 00:18:48.794
Wake up!

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:51.663
[LUFFY grunts, yawns]

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.132
[LUFFY]
I needed that nap.

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:54.867
I shoulda known.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.903
The only time you can sit
still is if you're asleep.

00:18:57.936 --> 00:19:00.239
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:02.307
Jimbei, are you crying?

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:03.609
Huh?

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:06.945
Oh, come now.
Of course I'm not crying.

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.481
[LUFFY]
Hm. What did I miss?

00:19:09.515 --> 00:19:10.949
[JIMBEI]
It's nothing, all right?

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:13.418
Let's forget it and move on!

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:17.156
[LUFFY]
Hmm. Sure. Whatever.

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:19.324
So, Jimbei.

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:22.194
What did the queen end up
doing to that thief she caught?

00:19:22.227 --> 00:19:23.395
Are you for real?!

00:19:23.428 --> 00:19:26.031
Ya mean you fell asleep at
the very beginning of the story?

00:19:26.064 --> 00:19:28.467
--[LUFFY] Did I miss it all?
--[SANJI] You did!

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.335
[NAMI]
Shirahoshi, right?

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:32.271
You gonna be okay?

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:36.308
[CAMIE] Namichin! She's royalty!
Don't be so casual, please!

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:40.078
Oh. Forgive me
for being so emotional.

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:43.582
It's difficult not to cry
when I think about my mother.

00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:45.984
She sounds like she
was quite the woman.

00:19:47.486 --> 00:19:49.721
Yes.

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:52.658
It's a real pleasure
to meet you, Namichin.

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:53.859
Uh, no, Princess!

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:56.595
Namichin is just a silly
nickname I gave her, so,

00:19:56.628 --> 00:19:58.430
it's just plain Nami! No chin!

00:19:58.463 --> 00:20:02.267
Excuse me, perhaps it's a bit
forward of me to say this,

00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:05.370
but even though we just met,
I feel a connection to you--

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:07.573
like we've been
friends for a long time.

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:08.807
Oh, yeah?

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.511
Well, we've both been through
some similar rough patches.

00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:15.681
[SHIRAHOSHI giggles]

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:18.116
[JIMBEI grunts]
Excuse me.

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:21.353
I just lost track of time.

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:23.155
I need to know
what the situation is

00:20:23.188 --> 00:20:25.190
at the Ryugu Palace.

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:27.092
Just to confirm
what you've told me,

00:20:27.125 --> 00:20:28.927
Hordy and his crew
have taken the King

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:32.764
and the palace guards captive.
Apart from that, you're not sure

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:35.701
what happened to
three members of your crew.

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.170
And that's all the
information we have, correct?

00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:40.706
[HACHI]
Nyu. Hey, Jimbei.

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.542
If the siege is playing
out as Hordy planned,

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:45.344
there's a good chance
the rest of the country

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:48.413
is falling to his
forces now, too.

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:52.050
Hold on. Are you saying
you know what his plan is?

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:55.454
To be honest, I have had
my suspicions he was up

00:20:55.487 --> 00:20:58.657
to something ever since
he retired from the army.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.860
But he was clever enough to
keep the details hidden from me.

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:06.898
Not me. I know.
But first, let me warn you.

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:10.235
Hordy hates humans even
more than Arlong did.

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:12.471
The only thing driving
him is resentment.

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:14.339
He talks about
rebuilding the kingdom,

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:18.210
but all he really wants to do
cause suffering to humans.

00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:20.412
And to prove my point,
you'll see there's

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:23.482
one big difference
between him and Arlong.

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:26.218
Arlong had no problem
with killing humans,

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:30.389
but the one thing he'd never
do is hurt other Fishmen.

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:32.791
Hordy? He doesn't care.

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:34.926
He'll also turn his
fury against Fishmen

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.562
who are sympathetic to humans.

00:21:37.596 --> 00:21:40.799
He'll cut down
anyone in his way!

00:21:40.832 --> 00:21:43.402
The World Summit is set
to take place again soon,

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:46.371
but a lot's changed
in the last four years.

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:49.608
For the first time
since Otohime's death,

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:51.476
they've actually
gathered enough signatures

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.378
for King Neptune
to speak at the Summit

00:21:53.412 --> 00:21:57.149
about relocating Fishman
Island to the surface.

00:21:57.182 --> 00:22:00.052
Huh. I see.

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:02.587
Then Hordy has seized
the palace just for that?

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:06.591
I wish. No, I'm afraid
it's a lot worse than that.

00:22:10.929 --> 00:22:12.664
[CHOPPER screams]

00:22:12.698 --> 00:22:14.900
[CHOPPER]
Wh-What is that?

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:18.837
[CHOPPER]
It's huge!

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.939
They get that big?

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:22.040
What the...?

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:24.509
It's a Video Transponder Snail.

00:22:24.543 --> 00:22:26.311
What's it doin' out here?

00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:31.383
[DEN]
Look! It's activating!

00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:34.920
[CAMIE] Oh, yeah. It's
projecting on the bubble.

00:22:34.953 --> 00:22:35.620
[gasps]

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:36.321
[NAMI gasps]

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:38.924
[JIMBEI]
Hmm... I thought so.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.161
It's him.

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:46.031
[SANJI]
What's up? You know that guy?

00:22:46.064 --> 00:22:50.001
That's Hordy.
This can't be good.

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:51.269
He found us?

00:22:51.303 --> 00:22:52.738
[CAMIE]
Hatchin!

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:57.509
[HORDY] Hello there,
people of Fishman Island.

00:22:57.542 --> 00:23:00.011
Am I coming through?

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:02.714
Well then, for those
of you who don't know,

00:23:02.748 --> 00:23:06.585
I'm the captain of
the New Fishman Pirates.

00:23:06.618 --> 00:23:10.455
My name... is Hordy Jones!

00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:15.660
[NARRATOR] Broadcasting
across all of Fishman Island,

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:18.296
Hordy makes his plans
for conquest clear.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.598
The people watch in horror

00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:22.667
as he prepares for
Neptune's execution.

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:25.170
Those who'd oppose him are
scattered across the island.

00:23:25.203 --> 00:23:28.573
With the Straw Hats in disarray,
Luffy is ready to fight,

00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:31.510
but Jimbei has
something else in mind.

00:23:31.543 --> 00:23:33.445
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.478 --> 00:23:37.682
"The Kingdom in Shock! An Order
to Execute Neptune Issued!"

00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:40.118
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
