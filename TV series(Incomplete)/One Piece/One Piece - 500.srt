1
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,724
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,461
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,062
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,065
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,600
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,369
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,038
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,040
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,810
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,446
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,046
of the World Government,

12
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,984
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,820
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,157
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:13,360
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:18,131
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,737
[NARRATOR] Unable to save Ace's
life during the War of the Best,

18
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:26,507
the injured Luffy was
taken to Amazon Lily,

19
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,075
where he fell into despair.

20
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,679
But this is a story from ten
years ago, in the East Blue.

21
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,114
Ace, Sabo, and Luffy

22
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:36,750
finally beat the tiger
with Naguri's guidance,

23
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,153
then bid him farewell as he
continued his own voyage.

24
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,725
[LUFFY]
"Freedom Taken Away!

25
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:48,061
The Nobles' Plot Closing
In on the Brothers!"

26
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,668
Hold on tight! The storm's
starting to pick up!

27
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,871
It had better be!
I'm bored! This is nothing!

28
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,973
Hey, guys!

29
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,209
It keeps getting
windier and windier!

30
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,979
Luffy. You better not
let go of that flag!

31
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:06,981
Real pirates can't
have a wimpy storm

32
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,248
blow their flag away!

33
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,383
[LUFFY]
Gotcha!

34
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,719
Come on, stupid storm!

35
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,255
You're gonna have to
do better than that!

36
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,623
Yeah! C'mon! Bring it!

37
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,126
[SABO]
Heh, heh!

38
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,694
Get ready, cuz here we go!

39
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,430
[screams]

40
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,264
[BOTH]
Crap! Luffy!

41
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,033
You okay?

42
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,536
Do I look okay to you? [screams]

43
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,305
Actually, yeah, looks fun!

44
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,973
[BOTH laugh]

45
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,909
Huh? Quit laughing!
Hurry an' pull me up!

46
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:39,713
[ACE, SABO laughing]

47
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:47,221
[LUFFY] We didn't get blown away
or nothin'! That was cool!

48
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:50,023
[SABO] Yeah, too bad we gotta
build a new hideout, though.

49
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,393
[ACE] No biggie, we just
gotta grab some new parts.

50
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,594
[LUFFY] This time,
I want a big 'ole telescope!

51
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,596
[ACE]
You'll never find something

52
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,330
that nice here, stupid.

53
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,967
[SABO sighs] I think I'd
rather have a cannon.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,969
[LUFFY]
Maybe some dummy threw one away!

55
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,603
[ACE, SABO, LUFFY laugh]

56
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,508
Lame, I think you were right.

57
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,111
I haven't found anything
like a telescope anywhere!

58
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,378
Shut up!

59
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,580
We didn't come out here to
get you a worthless telescope.

60
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:16,450
Go find something useful!

61
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:17,551
Not much for planks,

62
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,287
but I can always
use another pipe.

63
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,255
[gasps]

64
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,591
[SABO]
It's a telescope!

65
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,194
Luffy's not gonna believe this!

66
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:31,231
[BLUEJAM PIRATES chuckle]

67
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,833
Well, hello there.

68
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,537
Who woulda thought one of
the three Gray Terminal brats

69
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,572
was from a noble family?

70
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:43,110
Oh, yeah, and who
told you that, huh?

71
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,812
[BLUEJAM] All right, men,
try not to leave a mark.

72
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,148
[BLUEJAM PIRATE C grunts]

73
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,317
You jerks want a
piece of me, c'mon!

74
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,120
[ACE. LUFFY yelling]

75
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:54,121
[BLUEJAM PIRATE D groans]

76
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,957
[BOTH yell]

77
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:58,792
Oh, wow, nice shot.

78
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,594
You ready to take them on, Sabo?

79
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:01,628
Yeah!

80
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,031
Nobody can take on all
three of us at once!

81
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,300
I don't care if
they are pirates!

82
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,467
That's right!

83
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,937
We beat that big 'ole tiger,
so you guys are nothing!

84
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,672
Yeah? Just try me!

85
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,941
I know how we can
wrap this one up fast!

86
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,843
Let's go straight
for the captain!

87
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:16,643
Yeah!

88
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:21,515
[ALL grunting]

89
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,884
[yells]

90
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,018
[LUFFY grunts]

91
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:25,820
[SABO grunts]

92
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,654
[yells]

93
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:33,760
[ALL yelling]

94
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,603
All right, kiddos,
just give up nice and easy!

95
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:45,372
We never give up, ya hear me?

96
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,507
Damn! Let go!

97
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,908
What do you want?

98
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,211
[LUFFY] Get off my head!
I'm gonna kick your butt!

99
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:53,046
Yeah! Leave us alone!

100
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,616
[gasps]

101
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,960
It appears I arrived
just in time.

102
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:07,261
Crap, it's my dad!

103
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,095
[gasps]

104
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,362
[gasps]

105
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,932
He's caught! And we didn't
harm a hair on his noble head.

106
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:12,599
Bring 'im!

107
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,201
Don't you dare!

108
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,602
Hey! No!

109
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,739
[SABO] He wanted to find me
so bad he hired pirates?

110
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:19,940
Those other boys.

111
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:21,709
They're the ones
who tempted Sabo

112
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,145
into a life of debauchery
and wickedness.

113
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,279
Give him back, ya jerk!

114
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,781
What do you mean "give
him back," you filthy rat?

115
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,250
Sabo is my son!

116
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,585
Which means that he's
obligated to live on the path

117
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,988
that I have prepared for him!

118
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,255
You should be ashamed,

119
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,791
steering him toward the
life of a petty thief!

120
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:40,560
You're both nothing
but wannabe thugs!

121
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,563
Why did you do it?
For my money?

122
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,165
Screw your damn money!

123
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,067
[ACE groans]

124
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,168
Ack. You foolish pirate!

125
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:50,738
Quit knocking that kid
around so carelessly!

126
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,806
You'll get that delinquent's
disgusting blood

127
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,941
on my nice clothes!

128
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:54,941
[ACE growls]

129
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,709
Hey, Ace!

130
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:56,677
[SABO grunts]

131
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,645
[BLUEJAM PIRATE H]
Hey, come back here!

132
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,846
[SABO]
Stop this, okay?

133
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,415
Nobody tempted me
to do anything!

134
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,418
I only ran away
'cause I wanted to!

135
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,320
I'll be dealing with
you later, Sabo. Take him!

136
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,325
Deal with the other two
however you see fit.

137
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,793
Not a problem, sir,

138
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,195
you've already paid us
quite handsomely.

139
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,398
We'll make sure these two
never bother your boy again.

140
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,967
I'll spare you the gory details.

141
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,304
Wait, Bluejam!
Please don't hurt them!

142
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,207
Call them off, Dad,
I get it! Please stop!

143
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:30,210
Huh? What do you
mean, you "get it"?

144
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:34,448
Don't you dare, Sabo!

145
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,551
I'll do whatever you
want me to do, okay?

146
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,321
I'll live whatever life
you've mapped out.

147
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:44,959
Just please. I'm begging you,
don't hurt my friends.

148
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,027
They've done nothing wrong.

149
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:48,628
I can't stand this.

150
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,031
Those two are my brothers.

151
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:53,367
Sabo, no.

152
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,636
Oh? If that's what
you want, then go home.

153
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,572
And promise you'll
stop playing pirate

154
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:01,308
with lowlifes in
this trash heap.

155
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,578
No! Don't do it!

156
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:05,879
[BLUEJAM PIRATE I]
Shut up, kid!

157
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,382
Dammit, Sabo.
Run away from them!

158
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,650
Luffy and I can take
care of ourselves!

159
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,421
This is your life,
you have to be free!

160
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:16,190
He's right! Don't go!

161
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,093
[ACE] Are you gonna abandon all
your dreams, just like that?

162
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,393
Sabo!

163
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,633
Sabo!

164
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,833
[gasps]

165
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,205
[ACE]
Sabo!

166
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,113
Hey, Captain!

167
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,548
What do you want us to do
with the other ones?

168
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,483
We'll take them
back to the hideout.

169
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,485
[BLUEJAM PIRATE J]
Yes, sir.

170
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,688
[LUFFY]
You bastard! Untie me!

171
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:49,022
Come here and fight!

172
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,925
I'm not gonna lose this time!

173
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,626
[BLUEJAM PIRATE K]
Shut your mouth, brat!

174
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,128
Why'd you bring us
to your hideout?

175
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,896
You shoulda just killed us!

176
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,765
[BLUEJAM] It must be
awful nice to be a noble.

177
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,034
Wouldn't you punks agree?

178
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,204
To them, we're no different than
the piles of garbage we live in.

179
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,007
They just sit back while
we do all the dirty work.

180
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,043
It's a pretty cushy life
your buddy's living, I'd say.

181
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,212
You got no clue what
you're talking about!

182
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:15,116
Pirate life is way better
than being a stupid noble!

183
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,516
Sabo said so himself!

184
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,820
You kids are so hopeless I
can't help feeling bad for you.

185
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,488
Hey, untie their
ropes, and quick.

186
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:22,523
[BLUEJAM PIRATE K]
Yes, sir.

187
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:24,491
Why do you think a kid
from a noble family

188
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:26,526
ran off to a place
like Gray Terminal?

189
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,763
Did you think he just wanted
to make some new friends?

190
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,466
He was mocking you and
all the other people here,

191
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:36,203
just like adult nobles do
when they're feeling bored.

192
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:39,573
Real sorry to break it to you.
That boy's no friend of yours.

193
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,576
You're lying! Sabo would never
pull a stunt like that!

194
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,345
He's right! He said we were
brothers, you heard him!

195
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,882
Yeah, guess so. Whatever
you kids say. Ha, ha, ha.

196
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,217
But in any case,

197
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:53,653
you boys aren't gonna bother him
or his family anymore, are you?

198
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,155
'Cause if that's the plan,

199
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,625
I'm afraid I'd have to take you
both out right here and now.

200
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,461
If you really think of
him as your brother,

201
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,630
it'd be best for everyone
to leave him alone.

202
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,764
[gasps]

203
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,232
[ACE]
Leave him alone?

204
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,800
What about our dream?

205
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,136
No! Sabo told us that
he hates High Town!

206
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,705
Look, if you really care
about this Sabo kid,

207
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:14,241
then you gotta let him
go live his own life.

208
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,143
You'll understand
when you grow up.

209
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,679
Anyway, until recently,
I had a bone to pick with you

210
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:22,249
after what happened with
Porchemy and our money.

211
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:23,817
But I'm over all that now.

212
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,218
In fact, I'm kind of impressed

213
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,887
at how tough you
little punks are.

214
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,356
Which is why I wanted
to ask you something.

215
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,625
It might just be
worth your while.

216
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,294
Thanks to you boys,
I'm kinda short-handed.

217
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,865
So, how would you feel
about doing a job for me?

218
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,333
Don't worry. It's
a short, easy gig.

219
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,537
There's actually not really
much danger involved.

220
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,939
On that barrel's a
map of Gray Terminal.

221
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,175
You just have to carry
packages to the locations

222
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,077
marked on the map with an "X."

223
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,679
You interested?

224
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:52,679
Okay, sure.

225
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,981
[LUFFY gasps]

226
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,649
What about pay?

227
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,122
My head is tired.

228
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:04,124
Hauling stuff is no fun
if Sabo's not around.

229
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,325
Just deal with it.

230
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,727
I don't like this either.

231
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,129
I'd much rather find
Sabo and rescue him.

232
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:13,033
But Bluejam had a point. We've
gotta let him live his own life.

233
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,636
Look, give it some time.

234
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,539
He's gonna be all right
and if he doesn't like it,

235
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,108
he can always come
and join us again.

236
00:12:21,142 --> 00:12:22,643
Until that happens,

237
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,378
let's keep putting money
in the pirate fund.

238
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:27,881
[SABO]
Believe what you want,

239
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,616
it's still not Ace
and Luffy's fault.

240
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,819
[SABO'S DAD] Quit wasting
our time! Tell us the truth!

241
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,121
Wait just a minute.

242
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,056
Those scoundrels must
have threatened you.

243
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,924
They really have you
wrapped around their fingers.

244
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,828
No! They aren't those
kind of people, okay?

245
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,029
Any noble with a
criminal record to his name

246
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,665
will damage his family's
hard-earned reputation.

247
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,901
You would also be barred
from entering High Town.

248
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,803
Those two forced
you to leave home

249
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,406
and get involved with their
atrocious acts of violence

250
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,208
against your better judgment.

251
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,276
Isn't that right, Sabo?

252
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,749
Look here, son. The fate of
your friends in Gray Terminal

253
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,150
is in the hands of pirates.

254
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:05,118
Those pirates work for me.

255
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,722
All I need to do
is give the order.

256
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:10,157
If these slum brats
are that important,

257
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,593
think long and hard about
what you have to do.

258
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,532
[SABO'S DAD] You're a smart boy,
born to a great family.

259
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,001
You already know what's right.

260
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,636
You promised me you
wouldn't hurt them.

261
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,704
That's the only reason
I came back here!

262
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:27,274
You haven't changed at
all since I ran away!

263
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,809
No one tempted me!

264
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:31,979
I've made every decision
by my own free will!

265
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,415
[groans]

266
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:36,984
[SABO'S DAD]
You disappoint me!

267
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,318
I apologize, sir,

268
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:41,221
I'm so ashamed that I
have such a foolish son!

269
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:43,991
Surely you understand
my dilemma?

270
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:48,295
[COP A] Of course!
It must tear you apart inside.

271
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,098
Don't you worry, I'll take
care of all the paperwork.

272
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,500
[SABO groans]

273
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,585
[SERVANT A]
Welcome back, sir.

274
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,055
Home at last. Let's go, Sabo.

275
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:16,924
You've been gone
quite some time.

276
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:21,128
Ah! On second thought, don't
come in yet. You must be filthy.

277
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,197
Hose yourself off
in the yard first,

278
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,465
then come in and take a bath.

279
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:26,533
[SERVANT A]
We're all glad that you're

280
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,735
back home safe, young master.

281
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,505
Oh, goodness! Is it really you?

282
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,341
You've grown so big! [laughs]

283
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,509
Hello, Mom.

284
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:38,378
Now, Stelly, say hello
to your brother Sabo.

285
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,881
Nice to meet you, big brother!

286
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:44,151
I'm Stelly and I'm
eight! What about you?

287
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,619
[SABO]
What the hell?

288
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:47,988
We adopted him.

289
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,591
He's a promising boy
from another noble family.

290
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,559
For reasons beyond
understanding,

291
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:55,228
his parents suddenly
became neglectful.

292
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,298
So far he's fit
in extremely well.

293
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,367
I imagine that if things
don't work out with you

294
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,437
when it's time to choose a
successor, then he would...

295
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,706
Ugh, no, no, never mind.

296
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,940
I've said too much.

297
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,608
Go and get settled in your room.

298
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:11,278
You'll resume your
studies tomorrow morning.

299
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:23,056
[ACE] Are you gonna abandon all
your dreams, just like that?

300
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,624
[knocking]

301
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,295
Hey! Do you know what I heard?

302
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:31,331
You're as dumb as
a brick. [chuckles]

303
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:35,402
That's what Mama and Papa think,
in case you couldn't guess.

304
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,671
But still, you sure are lucky.

305
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:41,141
Tomorrow night they're
taking care of the garbage.

306
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:45,446
To think, had you stayed in
Gray Terminal a day longer,

307
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:48,114
you'd be dead like
the rest of the crooks.

308
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,284
Too bad.

309
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:52,720
My life would be a lot easier
if you never came back,

310
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:54,955
but I'm clever enough,
so I'll make do.

311
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,524
[gasps] Hey, ow! Stop!

312
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,393
Let go of me or I'll tell Papa!

313
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,196
What did you say?
What's going on?

314
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:04,665
You tell me everything,
or I'll beat you up!

315
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:08,202
Wait! Tomorrow?
There's going to be a fire.

316
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:09,837
They're burning Gray Terminal.

317
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,604
A fire?

318
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:11,938
That's right.

319
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,242
You didn't hear about it because
you've been away for so long.

320
00:16:15,276 --> 00:16:18,078
The nobles in High Town
decided it months ago.

321
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,347
The World Government is
sending a group of people

322
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,683
to check out all
of the East Blue.

323
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,986
They're finally gonna
arrive in Goa Kingdom

324
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,688
three days from now!

325
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:30,457
Rumor has it they
have a World Noble,

326
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,960
a Celestial Dragon with them.

327
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,528
People are panicking!

328
00:16:34,562 --> 00:16:36,563
The members of the royal
family don't want him

329
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,065
to see all the dirty
parts of this country.

330
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,801
So they made the
obvious decision

331
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,969
to burn down Gray Terminal!

332
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,606
It's a surefire way to cleanse
this country of all its rubbish!

333
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,609
There's no way they'd just burn
everything down without warning!

334
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:51,711
Don't joke about
something like that!

335
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:54,247
There's a lot of people
living in Gray Terminal!

336
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:57,484
They can't just torch down their
homes because they feel like it!

337
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,886
Get off of me!

338
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,187
You really are stupid.

339
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,557
Haven't you heard a
single thing I've said?

340
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,426
All the shame of this country.

341
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,161
Tomorrow they're gonna
burn it all away.

342
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,097
The people, too?

343
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,172
Hey. Wait up!

344
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,442
Where are you going?

345
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,115
[gasps] You can't jump
out the window like that!

346
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,055
Wow. He's a goner.

347
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,224
[SABO]
It's a lie. It's gotta be!

348
00:17:37,258 --> 00:17:39,426
They can't burn down
a place that big!

349
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,263
And someone would've heard!

350
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:43,964
[gasps]

351
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,435
[SABO]
Soldiers from this afternoon.

352
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,371
[NOBLE SOLDIER A] Are we sure
we're ready for tomorrow?

353
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,474
There can't be any
miscalculations.

354
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:54,908
[NOBLE SOLDIER B]
We're ready on our end.

355
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,876
But we're stuck
relying on the pirates.

356
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,781
They have to burn the trash
precisely at the right time.

357
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,716
[NOBLE SOLDIER A]
Don't worry. Bluejam and his men

358
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,152
have been placing boxes
of oil and explosives

359
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,988
all over Gray Terminal,
just like we asked.

360
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,225
[SABO]
Bluejam has a hand in this?

361
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,559
It must be true!

362
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,028
But why? What's in it for him?

363
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:28,375
Hey, Ace. What d'you
think Sabo's doing?

364
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:31,679
Seriously? Shut up.

365
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:35,116
I thought we had agreed to stop
worrying about him for now.

366
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:36,783
Okay.

367
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,185
Who knows.

368
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,287
This could actually
work out better for him.

369
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:42,155
[LUFFY]
Sabo...

370
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,026
Hey, Luffy!

371
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,495
Where's my telescope?

372
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:49,329
[sighs]

373
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:14,054
[SABO]
Okay, think.

374
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,590
if there was really
gonna be a fire tonight,

375
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,426
the people in the town would
be upset about it, right?

376
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,732
[NOBLE A]
Why, good morning!

377
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,433
A good morning to you, sir!

378
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:28,135
[NOBLE A]
What a beautiful sunny day!

379
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:29,603
[NOBLE F]
Yes, lovely.

380
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:30,837
What a relief!

381
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,741
Guess there's nothing fishy
happening today after all!

382
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:35,709
I'll walk around for a bit.

383
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,377
And just wait.

384
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:40,914
Come tomorrow morning, things
will be nicer than ever before!

385
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,716
[NOBLE F]
Yes, it'll be wonderful.

386
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:48,955
[CROWD chattering]

387
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:50,891
It's a little breezy,
but everything else here

388
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:53,126
seems as normal as can be.

389
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,097
[KING A]
Today is windy.

390
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:59,966
That's true, Your Majesty,
very windy indeed.

391
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,004
[KING A] Accidents can happen
easily on a day like this,

392
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:05,873
especially wildfires.

393
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:09,543
How right you are, Majesty.
It's quite possible.

394
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:12,446
[SABO'S DAD] What?
Sabo snuck out of the house?

395
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,348
He's such an ungrateful brat!

396
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,783
All he cares about is playing
pirate with his friends

397
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:19,086
when he should stay
at home and study!

398
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,588
Have the police search
the entire town!

399
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:25,392
He couldn't have gotten
very far by himself!

400
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,094
Um, excuse me.

401
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:28,695
What do you want, kid?

402
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,564
[SABO] Did you know that
there's supposed to be

403
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,533
a fire in Gray Terminal tonight?

404
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,601
Of course I know about the fire.

405
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,070
Why, what's wrong,
did they cancel it?

406
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:38,372
[SABO]
He knows.

407
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:41,275
Tell me, boy,
whose family are you from?

408
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,944
[SABO]
So, it's true!

409
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:46,179
Hold on!

410
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:47,881
[SABO]
Everyone knows, don't they?

411
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,650
They have from the start.

412
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,651
Look at them! They're smiling!

413
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:54,388
They don't give a damn about
the people in Gray Terminal.

414
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,157
They're happy to see them
burn them to the ground!

415
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:03,630
[BLUEJAM] You know,
we've been waiting on you.

416
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,832
Are there any more boxes
you need us to move?

417
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,969
Yeah, and I've got a
bigger job for you later on,

418
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:10,971
but we'll talk more
about that tonight.

419
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:16,042
[SABO panting]

420
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:17,811
[SABO]
Dad knows about it, too.

421
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:21,782
Crap. That's why he brought
me back home when he did.

422
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:23,483
As much as he hates me,

423
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:25,518
he still needs someone
to inherit his property

424
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,454
and maintain the
family's reputation.

425
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:28,688
[DOG A barks]

426
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,024
[gasps]

427
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:33,026
[NOBLE C]
Oh. Sorry about that.

428
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,895
He gets excited
around new faces.

429
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:36,563
Sounds to me like
you're out of breath.

430
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,065
Is there something
bothering you?

431
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:39,833
No, sir. It's nothing.

432
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:42,670
[NOBLE C]
Is that so? All right then.

433
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:44,704
Say, I was wondering,

434
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:47,174
did you know that there's
supposed to be a fire going on

435
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,408
in Gray Terminal tonight?

436
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,511
Yes, I heard all about the fire.

437
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:53,080
And you're not worried? At all?

438
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:55,415
Nobody in this town
cares what happens?

439
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:58,485
Nobody in town even thinks
of stopping this thing?

440
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,755
That's admirable of you.

441
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,325
You must have a very kind heart.

442
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:07,160
But, boy, please,
don't you say a word.

443
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:10,263
It's important that we all
keep our mouths shut.

444
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:13,533
Think. What would happen if
someone outside of High Town

445
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,536
found out about the plan?

446
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,271
You and I are special!

447
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:19,473
We come from great
noble families.

448
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:20,708
[SABO screams]

449
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:22,777
[NOBLE C]
Calm down!

450
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,512
[SABO]
Ace! Luffy!

451
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:26,413
There's something
wrong with this town!

452
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,549
Something wrong
with these people!

453
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:30,517
They know people are gonna die.

454
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:32,386
They're happy people
are going to die!

455
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:35,022
They're sick!
This whole place is sick!

456
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:36,757
I can't stay here any longer!

457
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,259
I have to tell them, right now!

458
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:44,698
[SABO] Today of all days.
Why is it so windy?

459
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,867
That's him! That's
the missing boy!

460
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,670
Excuse me, kid.
You need to come with us.

461
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:50,504
[NOBLES gasp]

462
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,406
Hey, you! Stop running!

463
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:54,875
[SABO] The nobles here
don't care who they kill.

464
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:58,178
They'll burn a whole town alive
just 'cause they don't like it!

465
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,746
You gotta get out
of Gray Terminal

466
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,115
and you gotta get out now!

467
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:06,953
Hold on, Ace! Luffy! I'm coming!

468
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:16,831
[NARRATOR] Luffy and Ace
unwittingly aided Bluejam

469
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:19,032
in the plan to burn
down Gray Terminal,

470
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,235
and may now perish themselves.

471
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:23,904
However, when Bluejam runs
into troubles of his own,

472
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:25,672
the night descends into chaos.

473
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:27,641
As the flames reach
higher and higher,

474
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:30,510
Sabo struggles in vain
to save his friends.

475
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:32,179
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

476
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:36,049
"The Fire Has Been Set!
The Gray Terminal in Crisis!"

477
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,718
I'm gonna be
King of the PIrates!
