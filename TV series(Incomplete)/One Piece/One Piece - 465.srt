00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,924
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,661
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,964
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,766
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,470
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,071
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,241
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,977
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,813
they capture the
unwanted attention of

10
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,247
the World Government,

11
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,783
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,921
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:10,357
I can't wait to see what kind
of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,427
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:18,565
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,170
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of his crew,

17
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,606
Luffy is rushing to Navy
headquarters to rescue

18
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,876
his brother, Ace,
from public execution.

19
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,478

00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,515
have successfully stormed
Marineford to save Ace,

21
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,951
and triggered an all-out
war with the Navy.

22

[ACE]
Oars!

23
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:53,300

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,626
[MORIA cackles] I'll have
to fix up that foot of his,

56
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,498
but that's a small price to pay
for another giant zombie!

[WHITEBEARD]
Oh, Oars.

58
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,713

I'm scared and I'm weak
and I'm useless!

Even our leaders are
falling one after another!

[AKAINU]
As soldiers of the Navy,

116
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:10,070
we carry the weight of
the justice of the world

117
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:13,640
on our backs, and we'll
gladly die to defend it.

118
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,943
Any man who turns tail
and runs doesn't deserve

119
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,912
to call himself a marine.

120
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:21,081
Let alone a man,
for that matter.

121
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,483
The most he could
be called is...

122
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,852
a waste of life.

[whimpering]

124
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:31,792
If you truly care about
your family as you say,

125
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,793
you'll only shame
them by living.

"Pirates are evil,

But that's only true because
history tells us so.

Children who've
never known peace

183

the definition of
right and wrong.

187

They'll decide the future and
how the past is written.

Ah. Will justice prevail?

There's nothing left to
prevent Whitebeard's allies

from entirely flooding the area!

can to stay prepared!

live by that rule.

keep it in mind.

decide that for us, old man!

does join the Navy,

and he'll eat all the food

in me for criminals...

Ace, you fool!

285
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,921
Why couldn't you have
just listened to me

286
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,056
and done what I asked?

287
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:36,937
Ace.

288
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:39,673
Trust me on this.

289
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:44,744
You two really should
join the Navy. Okay?

290
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,849
[GARP] I know you'll make
a strong Navy soldier.

291
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,124
Old man.

292
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,969
If you're feeling any doubt
over what must be done,

293
00:21:09,003 --> 00:21:12,539
I'm afraid I just can't
take pity on you, Garp.

294
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:16,576

would've done something already.

I just heard, Helmeppo?

Yeah.

schedule and immediately

pictured myself dying!

as fast as his legs
will carry him.

Yet even with his goal in sight,
the adversaries before him

331
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:28,041
may prove to be an
insurmountable wall.
