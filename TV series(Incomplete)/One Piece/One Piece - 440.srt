1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,867
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,669
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,906
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:47,775
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:50,578
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:52,347
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,283
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:57,952
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,986 --> 00:02:59,587
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,289
of the World Government,

47
00:03:01,322 --> 00:03:05,393
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

48
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:07,929
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

49
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:11,399
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

50
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:14,569
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

51
00:03:14,602 --> 00:03:19,207
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

52
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,746
[NARRATOR] After being
separated from his crew,

53
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:27,815
Luffy set out to rescue
his captured brother, Ace.

54
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:31,653
To do so, he snuck into the
government prison, Impel Down.

55
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:35,290
Bon Clay, who was saved
by Ivankov of New Kama Land,

56
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:36,824
has just learned
that Luffy's treatment

57
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:40,228
against Warden Magellan's
deadly poison has already begun.

58
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,398
[IVANKOV]
Making miracles is never easy!

59
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,235
[LUFFY]
"Believe in Miracles!

60
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,671
Bon Clay's Cries
From the Heart."

61
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,716
A miracle.

62
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:03,651
[IVANKOV]
Nothing less.

63
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:06,521
And, even then, it'll take a
tremendous one for Straw Hat Boy

64
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:08,489
to survive after
everything he's been through.

65
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:09,724
He's in rough shape.

66
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:11,426
You said it takes
courage and spirit

67
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,795
to make a miracle work
and Straw Boy's got both!

68
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:16,331
[LUFFY screaming]

69
00:04:16,364 --> 00:04:19,000
I know he can do it!
He can do anything!

70
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:21,469
That's why I'm not
nervous in the least!

71
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:23,938
Then, practice what you preach
and take a deep breath.

72
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,574
All we can do is wait
and trust in him.

73
00:04:29,577 --> 00:04:35,283
[CROWD chatter]

74
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,418
[IVANKOV]
I ate the Horm-Horm Fruits!

75
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:38,853
It gave me the fabulous power

76
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:41,990
to alter the hormones
of anyone I see.

77
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:44,692
I can change their sex,
body temperature, skin color,

78
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:46,761
growth, even their emotions!

79
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:49,063
I can remodel people
from the inside-out,

80
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:51,366
like an engineer
of the human body!

81
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,034
The candy boys and
candy girls you see here

82
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:56,571
used my help to really
kick gender in its sorry pants.

83
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:59,340
Some men became women
and some women men,

84
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:03,011
but all of those hang ups
are a thing of the past!

85
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:05,947
In short, those are the kind
of miracles we deal in here.

86
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,682
I just provide the hormones.

87
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:10,818
Ha-ha! Everyone else
provides the dream!

88
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,919
[GROUP cheering]

89
00:05:11,953 --> 00:05:13,888
Oh. Oh, yeah.

90
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,557
[BON CLAY]
He changed that man from earlier

91
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:18,993
into a woman by
injecting hormones!

92
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:30,471
I still can't believe that
there's a place like this

93
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:33,107
in the middle of a prison!
I must be dreaming!

94
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:36,344
It's not a dream!
It's a dream land!

95
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:39,514
[IVANKOV] All of these
candies you see around here

96
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,517
were once lost prisoners
who made it here by sheer luck.

97
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,952
Each with their own story.

98
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:47,622
See, there are hidden entrances
to New Kama Land

99
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:49,524
on every floor of Impel Down.

100
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,426
You just have to keep
an eye out for them.

101
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:53,661
There's one at the
bloody mountain of needles.

102
00:05:53,695 --> 00:05:55,797
One in the lair of wild beasts.

103
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,366
One in the burning hellfire.

104
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,535
There's even one
in the mortuary.

105
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,037
We use these handy-dandy
passages to go wherever we want

106
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,873
in this prison to get
everything we need.

107
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:11,813
A paradise hiding in the bowels
of hell itself?

108
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:12,980
Why, the jailers
would never believe

109
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:15,149
such an absurdity exists.

110
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:17,018
Despite living
in our hidey-hole,

111
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:19,987
we still keep tabs on everything
that's going on outside.

112
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:22,523
We've got a line in one
of the Transponder Snails,

113
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:24,959
the very same ones
the jailers use.

114
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:27,762
That way, we're in on all
the hip and horrible happenings

115
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:29,097
here in the prison.

116
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,832
We also nab newspapers
from the garbage

117
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:33,000
so we can we can keep up with
the other parts of the world.

118
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:36,437
And we were totally tuning in
to Straw Hat Boy's wild ride.

119
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:38,740
It's not every day we get to see
a break in, a break out,

120
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,808
and all sorts of
delectable nonsense!

121
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:42,677
We were cheering him on
the whole way!

122
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,446
But it seems like this place
of yours is gigantic!

123
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,647
Where exactly are we?

124
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:49,117
[IVANKOV] Oh, this place wasn't
always here, I assure you.

125
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,186
Some prisoner had a Devil Fruit
power that was good for digging.

126
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,123
They were the first to start
chipping away at these caverns.

127
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:58,159
They led other prisoners here a
long time ago, and, bit by bit,

128
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:00,995
the new recruits started
building this place together.

129
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:03,765
To paint a picture, this
paradise of ours is actually

130
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,868
a bit like an ant farm made from
digging tunnels in the rock.

131
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:08,970
But, to answer your
question, specifically,

132
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:12,106
we are located right
in between Level 5 and Level 6.

133
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,341
Whoa, hang on a minute!

134
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:16,911
Did you say Level 6? I didn't
know there was such a thing!

135
00:07:16,944 --> 00:07:19,514
[chuckles] Well,
it's not widely known,

136
00:07:19,547 --> 00:07:20,848
but I assure you, it is there.

137
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:22,683
[gasps]

138
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:26,721
Level 6 is where the true
villains are kept locked away.

139
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:28,022
Every one of them is condemned

140
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:30,725
to a lifetime sentence
without parole.

141
00:07:30,758 --> 00:07:33,194
It's known as "Eternal Hell."

142
00:07:33,227 --> 00:07:35,663
Exceedingly wicked crimes
are often covered up

143
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:37,965
by the World Government.

144
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,201
As are incidents that
would tarnish the reputation

145
00:07:40,234 --> 00:07:42,203
of the powers that be.

146
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:43,838
You know, like
your little rampage

147
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,641
that took you all
the way to Level 4.

148
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,209
If you had tried to pull
that same maneuver

149
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:53,014
a little while back, it wouldn't
have been so easy, by the way.

150
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:55,783
There was another beastly
baddie guarding this prison

151
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:58,085
not too long ago, you see.

152
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:02,190
He was the Jail Manager of
Impel Down, Shiryu of the Rain.

153
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:06,561
And, to size him up, he just
as strong as Warden Magellan.

154
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:08,963
Honestly, considering that
Magellan spends most of his time

155
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:09,997
sitting on the crapper,

156
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,266
you might say Shiryu
was twice as troublesome.

157
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,101
[gasps]

158
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:17,505
[BON CLAY] As strong as the
warden? Is that even possible?

159
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,640
Security's not too
shabby these days,

160
00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:22,543
but when he was around,
it was downright iron-tight.

161
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:28,716
[BON CLAY] But you said
he's gone now? What happened?

162
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,658
[SHIRYU growls]

163
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,733
[MAGELLAN] Shiryu, what do
you think you're doing?

164
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,101
My job.

165
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,236
The prisoners aren't here
for your amusement.

166
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,573
I remind you that
we're jailers, not butchers.

167
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,810
No one cares about the lives
of these vermin.

168
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,979
I will not tolerate
this any longer.

169
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,247
If someone were to find out

170
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,616
about half the atrocities
you've committed,

171
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,753
Impel Down would be
disgraced beyond measure.

172
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,055
Now, I must exercise
my authority as Warden

Heh...

00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,737
[IVANKOV] He killed prisoners
when and as he saw fit,

178
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,306
even on the slightest whim.

179
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,308
He was completely outta control.

180
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,611
So now, they hold him
in darkest corners of Level 6

181
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,180
as a high-security risk.

182
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,083
Unbelievable!
I've never heard of this.

I know it happened before
I got here, but even so--

He's in fine company, too.

185
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,656

Wolf, the "Great Battleship."

Even "Heavy Drinker" Vasco Shot!

188
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,598
The names of these

to make anyone

190
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:08,574
[IVANKOV] It's the worst
of the worst on Level 6.

191
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,110
Half the crimes these villains
committed were so heinous

192
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:14,080
even the newspapers
dared not mention them.

193
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,082
Your former boss is there, too!

194
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,884
I suppose he was pretty

00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,359
[IVANKOV] Back in Alabasta,

00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,761

206
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,777
Along with that other guy,

207
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,613
the one Straw Hat Boy
came here to save.

208
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,316
Second division commander
of the Whitebeard Pirates,

209
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,085
the "Firefist," Portgas D. Ace!

210
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,754
I heard about it over the radio.

211
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,023
They're brothers,
if I'm not mistaken.

212
00:10:58,758 --> 00:10:59,925
Yes, that's right.

213
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,996
Straw Boy said he only came
to Impel Down to rescue him.

214
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,998
It's insane that he
thought to sneak in

215
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,668
and miraculous that he did it.

216
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,270
Too bad his plan
is dead in the water now.

217
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,642
He has to save himself, first,

218
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,944
which unfortunately means
that he's out of time.

219
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,181
Ace Boy is set to be executed
this afternoon at 3 PM.

220
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,683
I believe they're going
to transfer him

221
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,218
to Navy Headquarters
sometime this morning.

222
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,953
It's already past midnight,

223
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,656
so that means Ace Boy
will be taken out of Impel Down

224
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,159
in seven or eight hours, tops.

225
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,364
[IVANKOV] Straw Boy's treatment
is going to take two more days

226
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,300
to run its course.
And, even if he survives,

227
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,369
he'll need another
three days of recovery

228
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,937
to restore his strength.

229
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,340
So, by the time he wakes up,
it'll all be over.

Are you crazy?

231
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:53,112
He can't take two more days of
that torture! It's killing him!

232
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,781
As I told you, his chances
are extremely low

233
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,750
and he'll need
a miracle to make it!

he'll survive, anyway.

are you doing up there?

Hang in there, Straw Boy!

Hang in there, Straw Boy!

[ACE panting]

356
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,460
Listen, Ace.

357
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:52,698
That woman, I admit I don't
know anything about her,

358
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:56,602
but I think it's safe to assume
she's pulling your leg.

359
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,603
[ACE yells]

360
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,670
So what, you're just saying

361
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,074
she came all the way down
here just to lie to me?!

362
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,647
No, sorry.

363
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,683
I know you mean well,
but, honestly,

364
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,286
my brother really would
break into here.

365
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,588
He does stupid things
without thinking all the time!

366
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,224
Since we were kids,
he's always been reckless

367
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,960
and made me worry
about him! That idiot!

368
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,397
[GUARD D] Looks like
the day has finally come.

369
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,465
Finally is right.

370
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,433
I just hope they pull
this off without a hitch.

371
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,269
That goes without
saying, doesn't it?

372
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,137
Nobody wants a war
in Impel Down.

373
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,306
[GUARD C] Warden Magellan
will be here any minute.

378
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,695
The screams.

379
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,629
Yes, they've stopped,

380
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:01,466
despite how excruciating
the treatment is.

381
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,736
I fear his silence
brings grim tidings.

382
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,109
[IVANKOV]
A true pity.

383
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,680
And yet, he fought valiantly
for over 20 hours.

384
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,551
Oh! Straw Boy.

398
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,142
He's still alive!

399
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:20,846
That can't be right! It made
more sense when he was dead!

400
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:25,217
The hormone treatment
hasn't even gone a day!

Good morning.

Warden Magellan, sir,
it's time for the--

404
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,725
[MAGELLAN]
Sorry, diarrhea.

405

[DOMINO]
Please, hurry.

406
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,663
I'm afraid it's time for
the transfer of Portgas D. Ace.

407
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,534
[WHISTLER]
Keep it coming!

408
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,169
This way! It doesn't matter
if it's cooked or not!

409
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,837
Just pile it on!

410
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,309
[WHISTLER] Hurry up!
Just leave it close to him!

411
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,777
Wow, he's taking in food

412
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,679
like his stomach's
made of quicksand!

413
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,415
I thought this guy was tiny,
where's he put it all?

414
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,716
It's already been 30 minutes,

415
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,885
and he's shows
no signs of stoppin'!

416
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,689
Whoa, look at that.

417
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,657
There goes a whole week
of food for us.

00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,228
The boy's got some vitality.
I'll give him that.

Whoa, that's not natural, man.

[NARRATOR] After Luffy
is miraculously cured

429
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,463
by Iva's treatment, he prepares
to set off on his own,

430
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,365
hoping to catch up with Ace.

431
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,666
But, before he can leave,

432
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,369
Iva realizes that
Luffy is Dragon's son

433
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,339
and decides to lend a hand,
revealing that Iva himself

434
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,474
was a memeber of the
Revoluationary Army.

On the next One Piece:

436

"Luffy Back in Action!
Iva Begins the Breakout Plan!"

00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,982
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
