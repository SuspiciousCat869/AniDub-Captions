00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,891
And I'm Luffy.

178
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,393
Nice to meetcha.

185
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,573
Look. He's been hit!

[MORGAN groans]

187
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,641
You runt...

[MORGAN growls]

190
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,745
Now, die!

191
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,414
[LUFFY]
I don't think so!

‐‐[LUFFY grunts]
‐‐[MORGAN groans]

193
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,085
The captain's getting
pummeled out there.

194
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,822
It's embarrassing.

195
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,758
Call yourself a Marine.

196
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,994
But you destroyed my
friend Coby's dream.

197
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,095
[MORGAN groans]

198
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,663
‐‐[LUFFY growls]
‐‐Straw Hat!

199
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,764
Stop right there!

200
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:19,932
Look at what I got!

[HELMEPPO]
Are ya stupid or something?!

203
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,103
I said stop!

204
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,605
If you would pay
attention to me,

205
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,607
I have a hostage here
you might wanna look at!

206
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,442
Helmeppo's crazy.

207
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,443
Hey.

208
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,777
[LUFFY]
Huh?

209
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,946
If you value your squatty
little friend's life,

210
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,014
you won't move a muscle!

211
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,884
I'm serious! One move and
I'll shoot him! I swear!

[gasps]

216
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,959
Luffy, listen!

217
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,029
Don't let anything that happens
to me stop you, no matter what!

218
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:50,963
Even if I die!

219
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,466
Of course. You got it.

220
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,234
You hear that, you big idiot?

221
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,970
Coby is ready to
die by your hand.

222
00:08:58,971 --> 00:08:59,972
Don't you move!

223
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,741
I said don't move or I'll shoot!

224
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:02,808
I swear it!

225
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,644
Luffy!

226

For I am fearless Marine
Captain "Axe‐Hand" Morgan!

229
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,153
Daddy, hurry up
and kill him already!

230
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,655
[LUFFY]
Pistol!

[HELMEPPO screams]

232
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,894
Nice one.

[MORGAN groans]

234
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:31,904
Thank you.

235
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,907
I'm Just doing my job, Captain.

[MARINE A]
Captain Morgan's been beaten.

239
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,084
[MARINE E]
Unbelievable!

240
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,852
[MARINE C]
Those guys are unreal!

241
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,088
If there's anyone else

242
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,857
who wants to step forward
to fight us, then do it now.

Finally!

00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,200
[MARINE I]
It's really happening!

249
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,202
[MARINE G]
Glorious day!

250
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,470
That's weird...

251
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,306
Looks like they're all happy
that their captain was beaten.

252
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,641
They must've been afraid of him

253
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,943
for a long time
before we showed up.

254
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,713

[COBY]
Zoro! Are you okay?!

257
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,217
What's wrong?!

258
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,552
I'm just...

259
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,886
...hungry.

260
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,827
[GIRL]
Sorry, you two.

261
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,629
You just have to suck
it up for a while.

262
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,231
[MARINES muttering]

263
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,080
[GIRL] I can't find
this sucker anywhere.

264
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,650
Hmm.

265
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,684

[GIRL]
That's it!

268
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,600
A maritime chart
of the Grand Line.

269
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,201
I knew they were hiding it.

270
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,606
[GIRL]
This isn't the map.

271
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,107
What mark is that?

272
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,046
So, it's Buggy.

273
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,582
Also known on the seas...
as Buggy the Immortal.

274
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,045
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

275
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,715
[ZORO]
Whew! I am stuffed!

276
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,449
[ZORO sighs]

277
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,117
Having not eaten
for three weeks,

278
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,786
I was ready to gnaw
through my boot straps.

279
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:05,124
[GROUP laughs]

280
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,726
I can't believe you're finished.

281
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,060
Lightweight.

282
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,829
How the hell can you
have a bigger appetite

283
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,297
than a guy who hasn't
eaten in weeks?

284
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,899
[LUFFY] It just tastes too
good, I guess. Right, Coby?

285
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,134
Uh, yeah, It's great.

286
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,969
Thanks for fixing it for us.

287
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,137
My pleasure.

288
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,406
After all, you guys
did save the town.

289
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,008
You're the most amazing
man I've ever met!

290
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,643
Yeah, I am, I know.

291
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:25,811
I'll be more amazing...

292
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,148
...when I'm King of the Pirates,
and I have the One Piece.

293
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,016
Oh, and the best
crew on the seas.

294
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:31,817
So.

295
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:32,985
How many others
have you gathered

296
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,321
for your crew besides me?

297
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,188
[LUFFY]
Hm?

298
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,189
You told me that you
were in the middle

299
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,092
of gathering together
the crew for your ship.

300
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,761
And if you're gonna be
King of the Pirates,

301
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,764
I gotta assume you already
have some waiting in the wings.

302
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,831
[LUFFY]
Nope, just you.

303
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:46,832
[gasps]

304
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,267
Just...?

305
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,169
Yep. It's just us.

306
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,005
So you and I are what amounts
to an entire pirate crew?

307
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,006
[LUFFY]
What's wrong with that?

308
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,341
We're a couple of strong guys!

309
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,175
Okay...

310
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,843
But please tell me
you have a ship.

311
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,678
[LUFFY]
Sure do. It's right there.

312
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:07,720
You're kidding.

313
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,122
Nope. But we'll have an
enormous one before long.

314
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,357
Just you wait and see!

315
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,125
[laughing]

316
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,460
And how's that?

317
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,196
With a great big
pirate flag on top.

318
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:23,736
[LUFFY laughing]

319
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,039
I can't wait!

320
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,375
I think Luffy was born
without that part of the brain

321
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,877
that allows the rest of us to
plan out what we have to do.

322
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,412
I can't believe I let
myself get suckered

323
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,314
into having him as my captain.

324
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,384
Hey! We'll have a ton more
crewmembers in no time.

325
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,485
[RIKA]
Luffy?

326
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,720
Where are you and your
crew planning on traveling

327
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,988
when you leave here?

328
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,390
You mean it's not obvious?

329
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,325
We're headed straight
for the Grand Line.

330
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,762
No! Have you completely
lost your mind?!

331
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,063
You have two crew members!

332
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,065
There's no way you're equipped
to handle the Grand Line, Luffy!

333
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,066
I've heard about it,

334
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,836
but I never knew it was
such an awful place.

335
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,771
It's worse than you think.

336
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,340
You know that this world
has two oceans, I'm sure.

337
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,777
There is an enormous landmass
that cuts across both of them.

338
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,246
This is called the Red Line.

339
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,950
Legend tells of a town that sits
dead center on the Red Line.

340
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,352
The Grand Line is said
to cut through this town

341
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,855
at a right angle and
stretch all the way

342
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,457
around the rest of the world.

343
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,092
The story goes on to say

344
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,962
that Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

345
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,265
had once obtained everything
this world had to offer.

346
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,133
Before he died, he said

347
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,871
that he left the great One Piece
treasure at this location.

348
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,774
Ever since, pirates have
set sail for the Grand Line.

349
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:39,111
Today the place is
nothing but a battlefield,

350
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:42,448
and some even call it
the pirate graveyard.

351
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,820
I heard stories about it
from people passing through.

352
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,121
The customers say that no one

353
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,489
who has ever entered
the Grand Line

354
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,391
comes out of
that place alive.

355
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,392
Which is really too bad,

356
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,327
'cause that's where the
One Piece is said to be,

357
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,963
and that's exactly
where we're going.

358
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,498
I guess we have to live with it.

359
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,400
No! You can't agree!

360
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,402
[ZORO] What do you care, you're
not going with us are you?

361
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,237
No... But I still worry...

362
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,307
Is it so wrong to care
about the two of you?

363
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,143
Luffy and I haven't known each
other for years or anything,

364
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,312
but I'd still consider
him a friend.

365
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,480
Wouldn't you say?

366
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:15,180
Of course.

367
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,316
We may have to part ways but...

368
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,817
...we'll always be friends.

369
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:19,919
[gasps]

370
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:26,258
[COBY] When I was a just little
kid, I never had any friends,

371
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,995
much less anyone who would
bother fighting on my behalf.

372
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,832
So I always tried my hardest
never to fight for anything.

373
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,336
[COBY] But the two of you
have taught me a lesson

374
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,504
I could never learn on my own:

375
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,606
How to live for
what I believe in!

376
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,009
So I've decided to make my
one childhood dream a reality,

377
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,178
and I'm going to
join the Marines!

378
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,013
[ZORO] Then don't you think
you should be a little more

379
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,115
concerned with your situation?

380
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,350
[gasps]

381
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,186
I mean, you did spend two
years on Alvida's pirate ship,

382
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,522
even if you were nothing
but her cabin boy.

383
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,624
[COBY]
Uhh...

384
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,360
The Marines' information
gathering is top‐notch.

385
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,195
They'll find out about
your time with Alvida,

386
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,630
and you'll never join.

387
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,899
I... never thought of that...

388
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,034
[LIEUTENANT]
Hey! You there.

389
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,135
[COBY, RIKA gasp]

390
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,208
We heard that you fellas
are actually pirates.

391
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,543
Is this rumor true?

392
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,878
Right, and I just added the
first member to my crew.

393
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,881
So pretty much the whole
thing just became official.

394
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,084
We appreciate everything you
did to save our town from

395
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,387
that horrible tyrant who
terrorized us all for so long.

396
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,256
However, now that we know that
you're pirates, as Marines,

397
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,561
we cannot sit idly by and watch
you go about your business.

398
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,062
Therefore, you and your crew

399
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,231
will need to leave
this town immediately.

400
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,000
But out of respect for
what you've done,

401
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,068
we will not report
you to headquarters.

402
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,103
Are you crazy?

403
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,105
How do you find the
nerve to talk like that?!

404
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,673
[MAN B]
Before these pirates came along,

405
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,908
you guys were as scared
of Morgan as we were.

406
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,244
[WOMAN A] Without them,
we'd still be under his reign.

407
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,412
We owe them our lives!

408
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:58,250
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

409
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,185
Well, time to go!

410
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,021
Thanks for all
of the food, lady.

411
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,923
Hey, wait a second.
You're leaving already?

412
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:05,924
Yeah.

413
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,698
[COBY whimpers]

414
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,100
[LIEUTENANT] Aren't you
part of the crew, as well?

415
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:19,271
[COBY gasps]
Uh, well, I... uh... I...

416
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:23,976
[LIEUTENANT]
Hold it!

417
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,445
Is he with you or what?

418
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,446
What I can tell you

419
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,482
is what he's been busy
doing up to this point.

420
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,951
[COBY]
Luffy! You wouldn't!

421
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,055
Yeah, there was this
fantastically fat pirate lady.

422
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,723
I think her name was Alvida.

423
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,625
Luffy.

424
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,294
[COBY] If they find out
I ran with a pirate crew,

425
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,130
I'll never join the Marines.

426
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,466
She carried around this
huge iron club and, boy,

427
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,469
she was the nastiest looking
woman I've ever seen.

428
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,239
For two years, this wimpy kid
was her own private cabin boy.

429
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,474
[COBY]
Please stop!

430
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,142
You can't do this!

431
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,311
Luffy, no!

432
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,345
[COBY yells]

433
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,346
[BOTH gasp]

434
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,481
[MARINES gasp]

435
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,650
[ZORO]
Hm.

436
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,651
[COBY whimpers]

437
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,418
[gasps]

438
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,653
[LUFFY chuckles]

439
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,521
Now that was a dumb move.

440
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,990
[COBY, LUFFY grunting]

441
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,992
[LUFFY]
Bastard!

442
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:14,993
Damn you!

443
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,195
Get out of here now!

444
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,530
We can't have you pirates
ripping up this town any more

445
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,265
than you already
have, you hear me?!

446
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,333
[ZORO]
Enough.

447
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,501
You made your point.

448
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,336
Now let him fall to the ground.

449
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,671
[COBY groans]

450
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:30,509
[COBY panting]

451
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,678
It's obvious you're not
crewmates so stop badgering

452
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:36,348
the poor kid and take your leave
of our town this instant!

453
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,349
[LUFFY]
Heh.

454
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,551
[COBY]
Huh?

455
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,023
[COBY]
That was on purpose?

456
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,726
Luffy did that
just to help me out.

457
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,298
[COBY] He worked me
up and got me so mad

458
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,702
that I'd hit him and look
like I wasn't on his side.

459
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,039
[COBY] Even at the very
end of our journey together,

460
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,809
I wound up continuing
to rely on him.

461
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:07,379
I couldn't do
anything for myself.

462
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,048
Nothing's changed
for me at all.

463
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,320
[COBY]
I am such an idiot!

464
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,222
‐‐[COBY] Sir!
‐‐[LIEUTENANT] Hm?

465
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,223
Please, sir.

466
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,491
Please, you have to let
me join the Marines.

467
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,495
I'll clean and scrub and do any
chores that you'd like me to.

468
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,565
I'll do anything
to become a Marine.

469
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,666
[LIEUTENANT]
Hm.

470
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,404
Lieutenant. I can't say
I fully trust this kid.

471
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,073
I wouldn't be against the idea
if there weren't clear cases

472
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,744
of certain Marines
actually being pirate spies.

473
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,680
I say, we should conduct
a background check first.

474
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:45,517
No matter what you say, I am a
man who will become a Marine!

475
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,755
[reaction missing]

476
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,695
[LIEUTENANT] I can't tell
you how many of our comrades

477
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,464
have been killed by
pirates over the years.

478
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,533
This is a big step
you're taking.

479
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,434
So...

480
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,436
[LIEUTENANT]
Permission to join granted.

481
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,973
Sir!

482
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,155
[GIRL]
Hmph.

483
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,923
[ZORO] That was a thin act
you put on back there.

484
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,725
I wouldn't be surprised if
they see right through it.

485
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,826
[LUFFY laughs]
Coby should be able

486
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,562
to handle the rest on his own.
I have faith in him.

487
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,431
[ZORO] It is a fitting
way to leave this place,

488
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:35,334
unable to turn back 'cause
everyone here hates us now.

489
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,236
Very pirate‐like.

490
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:37,769
[laughs]

491
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,504
Yeah. It sure is.

492
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:40,839
‐‐[COBY] Luffy!
‐‐[LUFFY] Huh?

493
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,576
I can never thank you enough.

494
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,446
You've done more for me
than anyone ever has!

495
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,182
I've never heard of a Marine
thanking a pirate before.

496
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,583
That's one for
the history books.

497
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,352
[LUFFY laughs]

498
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,288
[LUFFY]
We'll meet again, Coby!

499
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,356
Someday!

500
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,357
Bye, Luffy.

501
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,626
Hope to see you again someday!

502
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,795
All hands, salute!

503
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:04,863
[COBY gasps]

504
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,533
See ya!

505
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,536
[LIEUTENANT] That's a good
friend you have there.

506
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,537
[COBY gasps]

507
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:18,777
Yeah!

508
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,045
[LIEUTENANT]
Men!

509
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,315
Seeing as our current salute
is in violation of Marine law,

510
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,318
we will all go without
food for three days!

511
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,620
Do we all understand this?!

512
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,888
[MARINES, COBY]
Yes, sir!

513
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,394
[COBY] I know that we'll
meet again someday.

514
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,730
Deep inside, I feel it as much
as I've ever felt anything.

515
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,000
even if we are divided
as pirates and Marines,

516
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,803
I still look
forward to that day.

517
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,911
At last, our pirate
crew finally sets sail!

518
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,913
I got the feeling some
interesting adventures

519
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,814
are waiting for us.

520
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,416
[LUFFY laughs]

521
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,254
I'll be King of the
Pirates. I know it.

522
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:05,924
You seem more than obsessed

523
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,592
with this King of the
Pirates business.

524
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,027
Is there some kinda
story behind it?

525
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,862
Or any kind of reason at all?

526
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,364
[LUFFY]
No. No reason.

527
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,265
It's just...

528
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,099
Just what?

529
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,336
I promised someone...
a while back...

530
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,772
[LUFFY] I swore that
I would gather a crew,

531
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,774
find the world's
greatest treasure,

532
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,277
and become King of the Pirates.

533
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,951
And this straw hat
knows the whole story.

534
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,787
I see.

535
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,065
Now! Let's go!

536
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,701
It's time for us to
set our heading...

537
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,637
...for the Grand Line!

538
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:07,319
<i>♪As a kid, I never stopped</i>

539
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,822
<i>Searching for a great treasure</i>

540
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:14,659
<i>I had a map in my mind</i>

541
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,729
<i>That I knew would lead me</i>

542
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:21,500
<i>I had to find my way</i>
<i>to that place</i>

543
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,903
<i>Before someone could beat me</i>

544
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:28,607
<i>The promised land</i>

545
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:32,010
<i>And I wouldn't let go</i>

546
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,681
<i>My only dream...</i>

547
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:46,124

<i>I'll call out your name</i>

550
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,468

555
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,891
[ZORO]
You're kidding.

556
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,726
You don't even know how
to navigate correctly?

557
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,727
[LUFFY]
Well, do you?

558
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,728
[ZORO]
No!

559
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,397
[LUFFY] Ah! Would you
stop rocking the boat?!

560
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,898
You'll knock my hat off!

561
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,967
[ZORO] Is that straw hat
that important to you?

562
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,835
[LUFFY]
Yeah!

563
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,069
It's my treasure,

564
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,005
and I have to return it to him
after I'm King of the Pirates.

565
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,407
[ZORO]
Who's him?

566
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,075
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

567
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:40,078
"Luffy's Past!
Enter Red‐Haired Shanks!"

568
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,581
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
