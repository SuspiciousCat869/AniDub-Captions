00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,716
[CRAFTSMAN T] It's that guy
in the costume! Get him!

175
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,785
Those bastards!!

176
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:21,155
RAHH!! I'll pound
in their faces!!

177
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:21,755
[LULU]
I got your back!

178
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,523
[KAKU]
Wait! Hold on!

179
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,192
For Pete's sake.

180
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:29,563
[HATTORI]
Coo coo.

181
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,567
There he goes! Hurry!

182
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,302
We got this clown!

183
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:38,138
He's alone. Box him in!

184
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,207
Stop! It's the end of the line!

185
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,326
[CRAFTSMAN W]
He's headed for the roof!

186
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,768
[CRAFTSMAN AA] So, ya
thought ya could get away.

187
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,036
Didn't ya, punk?

188
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:12,439
[CRAFTSMAN AA] It's gonna take a
lot more than that to get by us.

189
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:16,277
You made a big mistake when you
decided to mess with Galley-La.

190
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,480
Prepare for the
beating of your life!

191
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,750
Cause we're not gonna
show any mercy, scumbag.

192
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:25,185
[MASKED WOMA] You can come
at me with all you've got.

193
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:28,722
But it still won't be enough.

194
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:29,789
[CRAFTSMAN II]
Got two over here!

195
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,025
[CRAFTSMAN UU] They're
headed for the back door!

196
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:36,530
[CRAFTSMAN KI]
Let's try and corner them!

197
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,332
Move, move! After them!

198
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,500
[CRAFTSMAN KU] Don't let
those bastards get inside!

199
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,576
[MASKED MAN] You have the
floor plan memorized.

200
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:50,344
Is that correct?

201
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,678
Yes.

202
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,385
So, they all seem pretty
worked up down there.

203
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:02,455
Yeah. There is definitely
something going on right now.

204
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:07,527
Alright, then. When are
we gonna make our move?

205
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:10,798
Hey, where's Luffy?

206
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,567
Ahhh!!!

207
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,071
[ZORO and NAMI] That idiot!
What about the plan??!

208
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:21,141
I thought we weren't
gonna rush into anything!!

209
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:23,777
[CHOPPER]
Too late.

210
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,663
[CRAFTSMAN KA]
They're going for the back door!

211
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,465
Let's head em off!

212
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,000
[CRAFTSMAN KI] No matter
what, they can't get inside!

213
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:54,642
You got alotta
nerve coming here.

214
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:57,344
After the crap you
tried to pull last night?

215
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,680
You're gonna pay
for what you did!

216
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,415
Oh yeah, you guys are in

217
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,184
for a world of hurt for
messin' with Mr. Iceberg!

218
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,719
Surrender!

219
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,255
[CRAFTSMAN KO]
Give it up now,

220
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,158
and we might just go easy on ya!

221
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:11,759
[CRAFTSMAN KO.5]
You're surrounded!

222
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:12,960
There's nowhere to run!

223
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,628
[CRAFTSMAN SA] We already
know that it's not just the two

224
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,530
of you guys in your
little pirate gang.

225
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,331
Now where are the others?!

226
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,376
He's pullin' out a weapon!

227
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,745
[CRAFTSMAN SHO]
Shoot 'em!

228
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:51,365
[CRAFTSMAN SE]
No way! They're gone?!

229
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:53,067
[CRAFTSMAN SO]
What the hell?

230
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,534
[CRAFTSMAN TA]
Where'd they go?

231
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,279
Hey, are you okay?

232
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:09,316
Man, that guy's a monster.

233
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,286
He flew. He was
flying through the air.

234
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,388
[CRAFTSMAN TSU]
What the hell?

235
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,491
He can fly?

236
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:21,362
[MASKED WOMAN] Idiots.
Do you not know when to give up?

237
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:24,130
Aaaaaah!

238
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,268
[CRAFTSMAN TO]
He's jumping!

239
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:28,468
[MASKED WOMAN]
Moon Walk!

240
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:34,641
What the?! He's really flying!

241
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,112
[MASKED WOMAN]
Thorny Road!

242
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:51,725
[MASKED WOMAN] I told you
you were bested, didn't I?

243
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,694
[CRAFTSMAN NA]
Get ready! Here he comes!

244
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,195
[CRAFTSMAN NI] He's gonna
land in the courtyard!

245
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,563
Don't let him escape!

246
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,232
[CRAFTSMAN NU]
There he goes! Get around him!

247
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,333
We can trap him in there!

248
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,767
[CRAFTSMAN NE]
Yeah!

249
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,040
[PAULIE]
This is it.

250
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,541
[SKULL MASK]
Interesting.

251
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,809
Huh?

252
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:13,314
[BULL MASK] All this time it was
literally right under our noses.

253
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,348
Hand it over.

254
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:21,555
[BULL MASK] You can't possibly
understand its importance.

255
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,260
Who are you bastards?

256
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,362
Where in the hell
did you come from?

257
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:29,830
[SKULL MASK]
From the shadows.

258
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:32,533
[BULL MASK] Yes. From the
darkest corners of existence

259
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:35,102
we bring with us
the light of justice.

260
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:40,541
We are Cipher Pol No. 9, an
undercover intelligence agency.

261
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:42,810
[PAULIE] Well, no matter
where you freaks came from.

262
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:44,712
You sure as hell didn't
get in without running

263
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:46,747
into the Galley-La craftsmen.

264
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,249
[BULL MASK]
Perhaps we did.

265
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,183
Huh?

266
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,619
[BULL MASK] The details
are all very hazy,

267
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:54,421
a sea of fists and bodies.

268
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,091
What's important
is we're here now.

269
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:00,694
[PAULIE] I get it.

270
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:04,198
This ain't just some
assassination plot, is it?

271
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:05,265
[BULL MASK]
Very astute.

272
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,102
But then, we never claimed
that it was, now did we.

273
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:11,138
In any case we need what Iceberg
was trying to keep hidden.

274
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,608
The item you hold in
your trembling hand now.

275
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,312
And since you have been
made aware of its existence.

276
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,514
We need to take
your life, as well.

277
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,719
[BULL MASK]
In trusting you to this task,

278
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:30,123
Iceberg has signed
your death warrant.

279
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,127
[CRAFTSMAN NI] What's
the word? Did you find 'em?

280
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,028
Nu-uh!

281
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,130
There's no sign of
those guys anywhere!

282
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,298
They get inside?

283
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,599
There's men standin' guard

284
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:39,767
at every single point of entry.

285
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,069
No, there's
no way they got in.

286
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:42,870
[CRAFTSMAN NE]
Dammit!

287
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:43,837
Then where the
hell did they go?

288
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:45,372
[CRAFTSMAN NO]
They couldn't've gotten far.

289
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,074
They've gotta be
hiding somewhere!

290
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,410
Search the perimeter
one more time. Got it?!

291
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:52,245
[CROWD]
Yeah!

292
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:59,053
Here. He's behind this wall.

293
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:02,422
[MASKED MAN]
Right. Now give me a push.

294
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,758
Huh...?

295
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:14,235
Incredible. I had a feeling that
you'd be coming back for me.

296
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:16,570
But I can't believe my eyes.

297
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,506
Is this how you
came in last night?

298
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,275
How is that even possible?

299
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,444
[MASKED MAN] It's the
power of the Door-Door Fruit.

300
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,246
Where a normal man sees a wall,

301
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,514
I see a prospective entryway.

302
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,749
No matter how thick it may be,

303
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:31,751
I simply touch it
and it opens for me.

304
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:35,322
[gunshot]

305
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,558
Hold on. It's not time yet.

306
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,693
[MASKED MAN] Relax,
it's not a fatal wound,

307
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,528
he'll still be able to talk.

308
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,231
I'm just giving him a
taste of what's to come.

309
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,433
Like an appetizer of pain.

310
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,069
What's more after that,

311
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,771
I don't think he'll be
running off anywhere

312
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,507
before we get the
signal to finish the job.

313
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,478
Or, perhaps I should say to
serve him the main course.

314
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,047
[ICEBERG]
I see.

315
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,119
So that's how CP9
handles things, huh?

316
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:07,054
[MASKED MAN]
As a matter of fact.

317
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,289
That is how we do it.

318
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,694
That poor Straw Hat boy.

319
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:20,768
[ICEBERG] He had nothing
to do with this, did he?

320
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:23,404
There's no need to beat
yourself up about it.

321
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,340
After all, you simply told the
truth exactly as you saw it,

322
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,575
and I was indeed
here last night.

323
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:35,115
That was all part of
your plan, wasn't it?

324
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,216
[MASKED MAN]
Right again.

325
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,818
You're alive for two reasons.

326
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,453
First, so you could
tell your story

327
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:40,821
of the failed assassination.

328
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,690
Placing a member of
the Straw Hat crew

329
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,491
at the scene of the crime.

330
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:46,760
Secondly, we were
trying to ferret out

331
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,163
an important document.

332
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:51,765
The blueprints
of a certain ship.

333
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,235
One that has been
passed down in secret

334
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:59,073
from shipwright to chosen
apprentice for generations.

335
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:01,742
We knew that with your
life clearly in danger,

336
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:03,510
you would pass
that document on

337
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,113
to someone you
trusted to keep it safe.

338
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:12,353
You made that choice earlier
tonight. Your foreman, Paulie.

339
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:15,422
Our associates are with
him this very moment.

340
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,592
It's all going as
planned, isn't it.

341
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,329
You must be very damn
proud of yourselves.

342
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,566
[MASKED MAN] I want you
to see this to its end.

343
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,134
Of course.

344
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,502
[MASKED MAN]
I'll go deal with the riff-raff

345
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,804
standing guard
outside the door.

346
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,439
When the blueprints are secured,

347
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,341
our associates will contact you.

348
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:38,812
At that time you will have full
clearance to dispose of Iceberg.

349
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,047
Do so at once.

350
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:46,153
[MASKED MAN] Make sure
he dies, without fail.

351
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,823
After that, the only remaining
loose end will be Paulie.

352
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:54,128
He dies, and the truth of what's
happened here dies with him.

353
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:56,630
The blame will remain
on the Straw Hats,

354
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,531
and no one's the wiser.

355
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:03,704
I know he doesn't listen to me.

356
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:07,141
It's crazy, but I thought maybe
he'd listen to his own advice.

357
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:09,243
We are talking about Luffy.

358
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,211
Hey guys. Do you
think that's Robin?

359
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:14,481
In the middle of all that
commotion down at Galley-La?

360
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:17,618
No matter what Luffy decided to
do, we still gotta be careful!

361
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:18,619
Yeah, I know.

362
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,788
But him rushing in like
that might actually work

363
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:22,756
in our favor.

364
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,658
If you think about
the way he does things,

365
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,727
is he the kind of guy
that's gonna go in through

366
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,228
the back or side entrance?

367
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,363
Not his style.

368
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,297
No way.

369
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,399
So I'm pretty sure
by now he's made a go

370
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,134
at barging straight
through the front door.

371
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,103
And it's safe to
assume that right now

372
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:37,771
he's running around
inside like crazy,

373
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,274
because he has no idea where
he's going, doncha think?

374
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,308
Oh yeah!

375
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,676
Sounds like him!

376
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,246
Uh-huh! From the
shipwrights' point of view,

377
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,648
he's the leader of the
group that attacked Iceberg.

378
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,350
So if he made it
in there by now,

379
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:52,286
all of those guys are gonna
be busy trying to catch him!

380
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,188
Which would mean the guards
have severely thinned out

381
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:56,123
at the front door,
or at the very least,

382
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:57,658
they're completely distracted!

383
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:00,127
So the safest way in right
now is through the front,

384
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,696
right behind all the
chaos in Luffy's wake!

385
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,498
So when he does it,
it's completely stupid.

386
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:06,100
But if we do the
exact same thing,

387
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:07,468
it's actually a
brilliant plan, huh?

388
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:08,636
Yeah, makes sense!

389
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:11,505
I say that we
should go for it then!

390
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,407
[NAMI]
The gate is right up ahead!

391
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,809
Okay! Ready?!

392
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,144
It's show time!

393
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:18,778
Here we, go!

394
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:35,529
This was a dumb idea!

395
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:38,465
[LUFFY]
Guh, crap. This sucks!

396
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:43,637
I wanted to jump right though
the front door like a typhoon.

397
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,640
But I'm totally stuck!

398
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:53,180
Gotta get out.

399
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:56,516
Gotta get Robin!

After all this time,

402
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:18,098
I never thought we'd be
meeting here. Nico Robin.

403
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:20,501
[ROBIN] You say that as
if we were fated to do so.

404
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:21,669
What do you mean?

405
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:24,405
[ICEBERG] We might have more
in common than you think.

406

Explain yourself.

[ICEBERG] What I possess
and your existence

408
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,743
could destroy the world.

"CP9 Takes Off Their Masks!
Their Shocking True Faces."

I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
