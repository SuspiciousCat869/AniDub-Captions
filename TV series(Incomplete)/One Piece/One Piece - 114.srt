00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,295
[USOPP]
That's you.

179
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,364
[CHOPPER]
Oh, yeah.

[REBEL SOLDIER A yelling]

183
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,486
Are you all right?

184
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,520
[REBEL SOLDIER A]
Yeah.

185
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,025
[REBEL SOLDIER B]
Koza! Are you okay?

186
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,494
I'm fine.

187
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,462
Are you sure?

188
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,697
That bullet from Nanohana
is still in you.

189
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,833
[KOZA]
None of that matters now.

190
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,568
This is a battlefield we're on.

191
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,671
We have to stay focused
on what's happening.

192
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,373
Got that?

193
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,408
I'd like to get to
one of their horses.

194
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,976
If we can make our
way down this street

195
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,545
and through the center of town,
then we'll be at the north block

196
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,014
where the royal palace is.

197
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,915
[REBEL SOLDIER B, KOZA grunt]

198
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,651
What are you planning, Koza?

199
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,019
Why go to the palace?

200
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,722
To reach the king and
demand that he surrender to us.

201
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,990
But that's insane!

202
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,826
The main force of the royal army
is stationed in the north block!

203
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,396
And what's more,
they're led by Chaka and Pell.

204
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,597
Think of the danger!

205
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,432
And we haven't even
managed to gather

206
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,933
all of our forces together.

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,602
Don't you think it
would be a better idea

208
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,104
to wait until reinforcements
arrive here to help?

209
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,874
We can't.
It's already too late for that.

210
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,276
Now come on!

211
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:19,945
[REBEL SOLDIER B]
Wait! Koza!

212
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,038
Halt! Are you aligned
with the rebel army?

213
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,975
The only thing ahead
of here in the north block

214
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,144
is the royal palace.

215
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,579
Do you understand me?

216
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,615
[ROYAL SOLDIER C] If you
aren't a part of the battle,

217
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,918
leave this area of town at once!

218
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,753
[ROYAL SOLDIER A]
Hey! Are you listening?

219
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,656
This place is no
playground, you get it?

220
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:04,824
[VIVI]
I know that!

221
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,294
[ROYAL SOLDIER F]
Princess Vivi?

222
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,829
[ROYAL SOLDIER G]
It can't be!

223
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:10,963
[ROYAL SOLDIER H]
Is it really her?

224
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,601
[VIVI]
Where's my father?

225
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,736
I need him now!

226
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,471
Well, Princess...

227
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,506
[VIVI]
Never mind.

228
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,641
If I can't see him,
then take me to Chaka.

229
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,412
There's something
that he must do!

230
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,704
[MR. 2]
Deux!

231
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,040
Un! Deux! Un! Deux!

232
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,109
[MR. 2]
Trois!

[SANJI]
Bastard!

234
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,501
[MR. 2]
That was quite a kick.

235
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,204
This one can compete with
my Ballet Kenpo moves!

236
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,141
You! Out of my way!

237
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,242
[SANJI]
I already told you.

238
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,212
If you want to get by,
you'll have to defeat me first!

239
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,849
I hope you realize all your
efforts will be in vain.

240
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,685
All my life I have practiced
these dance moves.

241
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,821
I have perfected the
dancer's graceful art

242
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,589
of Ballet Kenpo
and it is unbeatable,

243
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,858
even by the likes of you!

244
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,498
[MR. 2] Just give up!
It's no use trying to escape!

245
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,036

My Degenerate Swan
Dance Recital!

248
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,127
This dance isn't
getting me anywhere;

249
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,597
it's time to settle
this once and for all.

My ultimate Swan Arabesque,

00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,690
stopped by that stupid,
insignificant cook?

00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,093
You've gotta be kidding me here!

266
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,865
Okay, it's time to get serious.
From now on, I mean business!

267
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,667
Do you hear me?

268
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,201
Let's see it, then.

269
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,336
Hah!

270
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:41,373
You don't know the true extent
of my power yet, do you?

271
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,208
My most impressive
feature is my ability

272
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,977
to remember faces.

273
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,012
Using that, I can
construct and display

274
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,781
an incredible montage!

you will laugh helplessly

until you collapse.

To begin... The world's
most ridiculous hair.

278
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:02,061
Then, the world's
most ridiculous eyes.

279
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,663
The most ridiculous nose.

280
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,999
And then the world's
most ridiculous mouth.

00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,969
Now, take a good, long look!

of the Copy‐Copy Montage!

[MR. 2 laughing]

285
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,700
About ninety percent of that
was your own ridiculous face.

00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,171
I'll help you.

00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,240
Stop playing dress‐up,
you ugly freak!

Don't you have a heart? I'm a
brilliant artist, you big jerk!

mess around with your

They aren't just tricks!

Just wait until you see!

294
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,956
Within my art there
lies the power

295
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,925
of the greatest friendships
and the truest loves!

296
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,727
Right, I get it.

297
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,229
I see what you're planning now.

298
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,364
[MR. 2]
We all need love! And friends!

299
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,767
It really just isn't
going to work, though.

300
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,802
Now let's see you hurt me!
[yells]

301
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,272
How could you do that?

302
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,774
You just attacked
your little friend

303
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:22,875
with the long nose!

304
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,878
Well, then, clearly you
don't value friendship much,

305
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,246
do you?

306
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,814
You're a real idiot.

307
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,416
No matter what you
transform your face

308
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,152
to look like,
you're still only you.

309
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,054
I'm not the kind
to be fooled by images

310
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,722
and façades like that.

311
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,760
No way! A person is their soul!

00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:45,431
[MR. 2 whimpering]

313
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,466
Is their soul?

[MR. 2 crying]

315
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,337
That's so...

316
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,806
Wow!

317
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,407
[crying]

318
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,509
I am so embarrassed to
have been so caught up

319
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,178
with appearances!

320
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,815
I understand,
even if I was to become...

321
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:03,849
...her, for instance.

322
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,452
It wouldn't make any
difference to you at all,

323
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,353
because images don't matter.

324
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,195
[MR. 2]
Well he's easy to read...

325
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,432
[MR. 2]
Really easy to read.

326
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,038
[MR. 2]
Incredibly easy to read.

327
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,611
You are such a fool.

‐‐[ROYAL SOLDIER I] What?
‐‐[ROYAL SOLDIER A] It's Vivi!

[ROYAL SOLDIER C]
But why now?

331
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,696
But Princess Vivi,
that's insane!

332
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,564
We can't do something like that!

333
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,903
What are you afraid
would happen if we did?

334
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,305
That the kingdom
would simply die?

335
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,907
You're wrong, it wouldn't.

336
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,176
This palace is not
Alabasta, after all.

337
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,915
Alabasta is...

338
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,401
It is the people who are
out there hurting each other.

339
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,270
They're the ones who
made Alabasta a country

at stopping this war,

Please, Chaka!

for a few seconds!

If you can do that,
then I will take it from there!

I swear, I can do this!

destroy this palace!

00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,481
[ROYAL SOLDIER A] But you can't
be serious, Princess Vivi!

351
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,717
[ROYAL SOLDIER B] The palace
has stood in the same spot

352
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,219
for four thousand years!

353
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,820
[ROYAL SOLDIER C] Please don't
go through with this plan,

354
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,055
Princess Vivi!

355
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,991
[ROYAL SOLDIER D] Chaka! You
have to use your best judgment!

356
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,826
[ROYAL SOLDIER E]
The king isn't even here!

357
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,162
You can't possibly do
this without his approval.

358
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,768
[CHAKA]
Sire! We must take action

359
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:40,172
against the rebels quickly,
before it's too late!

360
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,007
[COBRA]
This is not some little quarrel.

361
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,743
If we strike first,
they will strike back.

362
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,845
Are you suggesting that
we attack our citizens

363
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:50,148
before we determine
who's behind all this?

364
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,084
Because that would
be the true destruction

365
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,919
of our kingdom.

366
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:57,122
But we will act‐‐
we will head out for Rainbase

367
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,124
and Crocodile.

368
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,093
[PELL] Your Majesty,
attacking Crocodile now

369
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,528
will only make things worse!

370
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,365
It will only add fuel
to the rebel army's fire!

371
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,133
If we leave for Rainbase now,

372
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,935
the rebel army will
use our absence

373
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,371
as a perfect chance
to attack the palace.

374
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,139
[COBRA] It doesn't matter
if the rebel army

375
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,141
destroys this palace completely.

376
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,343
It's only a building.

377
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,344
You see,

378
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,446
even if our royal army
does fall in the end,

379
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,215
if we can just defeat Crocodile,

380
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,350
this country can still
be reborn as long as

381
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,786
its people are safe and whole.

382
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,788
If we battle the
rebel army instead,

383
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,323
then that will all change.

384
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,028
Remember...

385
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,364
...the people are the country!

386
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,038
[CHAKA]
Princess Vivi.

387
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,076
[SOLDIERS gasp]

388
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,378
[CHAKA]
I will do as you say!

389
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:58,417

[NAMI yells] Why did these guys
decide to come after me?

404
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,168
[ZORO] That dumb woman!
Where did she go?

405
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,137
[MR. 2] This guy may
be a first‐class cook,

406
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,506
but he's nothing special
when it comes to fighting!

407
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,242

more of my Ballet Kenpo,
