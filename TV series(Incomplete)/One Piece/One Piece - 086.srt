00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,418
Even if I should
disappear right now,

174
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,053
my dream will come true.

175
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,456
And when it does, the
citizens' sickness of the heart

176
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,425
will be cured as well.

177
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,262
You're crying... Why, Dalton?

178
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,434
Is that... true for a country?

179
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,904
Yeah, if the will
to do it, is passed on.

Don't worry, Chopper...

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,616
your mushroom won't kill me...

182
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,990
I've had... a marvelous life!

Thank you, Chopper!

185
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,486
[CHOPPER] This castle
is where Doctor died...

186
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,856
He gave his life trying
to save this country...

187
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,659
[CHOPPER]
This place is his grave,

188
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,828
and a symbol of
what he believed in!

189
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,097

190
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,433
Ah! I'd almost
forgotten that fool!

192
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,610
How dare you
desecrate my castle

193
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,112
by flying the flag of
that stupid doctor?!

194
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,281
I command that
it be burned immediately!

195
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,656
[CHOPPER] I'll never
let you touch that flag

196
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,625

Look, sir! He's that‐‐

You're right! It is him!

201

[KUROMARIMO]
He's that Doctor's monster...

202
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,903
...the one Dalton stopped!

203
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,576
That flag there...
It's a symbol of his faith!

204
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,746
I won't let you
take it down, not now...

205
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,514
...not ever!

207
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,385
We're going to take it,
and all of you down!

208
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,022
And we're going into the castle!
Show them no mercy, boys!

209
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,524

gonna fight, too?

Didn't your mother ever
tell you it's not right

00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,014
to strike a lady? 'Specially,
not a hot, young one?

this stupid thing come off?!

What's going on outside?

Nah, stay in bed.

If you need a coat,
you can borrow mine.

246
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,897
What? But it's
a girl's coat and it's ugly.

say any coat'll do.

Oh, yeah.

Come forth,

They might look silly,

They're tough...

So tough that the citizens
couldn't stand against them...

That's the number one

You refused my wishes,
and broke that law!

377

Now you are all going to
be punished for your crimes!

378
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,983
But first, I'm gonna
deal with the matter of

00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,853
that quack's flag
sullying my regal castle!

you were just fake ones,
weren't you?

flying a pirate flag means...

for something, big mouth!

as some kind of joke!
