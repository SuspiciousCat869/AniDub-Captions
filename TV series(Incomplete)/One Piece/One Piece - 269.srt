1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,737
It's the One Piece
treasure giveaway!

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,540
The first key letter to be
on the lookout for is...

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,277
We'll tell you how to enter
at the end of the show!

4
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,647
Riding on Rocketman,
the Straw Hat pirates

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,551
have infiltrated
Enies Lobby's Main Island.

6
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,190
So anyway, what
about our Captain?

7
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,092
Any guesses on where he went?

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:25,693
Who knows.

9
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,494
The island's pretty big.

10
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,296
Where should we start?

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,464
Huh?

12
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,536
That's got to be where he's at.

13
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,438
Luffy, who ran
ahead of the others,

14
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,440
is desperately trying to make
his way to the courthouse.

15
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,614
Spear!

16
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,720
He jumped onto the tree!

17
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,324
I'm not getting anywhere.

18
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:01,128
Don't those dumb jerks
have anything better to do?

19
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,197
What's up?

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,431
You take the reins.

21
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,599
Here.

22
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:07,768
Wait.

23
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,502
What's going on here?

24
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:16,310
When you see 'em, I want you
to pass on a message for me.

25
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,679
"You're all fired."

26
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,681
You got it.

27
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,417
All right, jump!

28
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,818
Not so fast!

29
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:29,222
Half Knot Air Drive!

30
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,103
Whoa!

31
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,605
He took out those
Watchdogs out in one hit!

32
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,074
You ready for round two?

33
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,579
Meanwhile, Robin
and Franky were caught

34
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,747
in the middle of a desperate
situation of their own.

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,948
Both the triggers needed

36
00:01:54,981 --> 00:02:00,053
to revive the Ancient Weapon
are right here, at my mercy!

37
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,591
You get it, now?

38
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,494
When I say the winds of this
world are blowing in my favor,

39
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,030
I most assuredly mean it!

40
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:15,236
Every man and every nation in
the world must answer to me!

41
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,538
All that power at
the tip of my fingers!

42
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,040
I don't understand.

43
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,577
Why would Aokiji allow you
to invoke the Buster Call?

44
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,193
What gives you the
right to question me?

45
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,094
You shut your mouth!

46
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,146
You get to play a part in
the rebirth of this world!

47
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,582
Isn't that enough for you,
you insolent witch?

48
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:47,388
I believe you should
even be thanking me!

49
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,124
I'll cleanse this world
of Ohara's legacy

50
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,393
by bleeding you dry.

51
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,696
Understand, Nico Robin?

52
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,325
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

53
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:31,599
Now listen, and listen well.

54
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:32,833
From this moment on,

55
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:36,270
I'm going to make you suffer
pain so excruciatingly agonizing

56
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:39,240
that you'll wake up every
morning wishing you were dead.

57
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,041
So prepare yourself.

58
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,543
I'm going to hurt you

59
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:46,046
and use you then
throw you out into the sea!

60
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,316
A life as sinful as
yours deserves nothing less!

61
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,489
Oh, and by the way,

62
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,759
I just received some
interesting news.

63
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:02,129
Apparently, a moronic
group of riff-raff has decided

64
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:06,200
to infiltrate our island in a
hapless attempt to rescue you.

65
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,569
You don't mean--?

66
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:09,570
Yes.

67
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,472
But, don't you worry.

68
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,141
I'm sure they've been
apprehended by now.

69
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:18,345
Straw Hat Luffy and his
crew will trouble us no more.

70
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,414
They're so stubborn.

71
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,152
They're little more
than insects compared

72
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:28,822
to the might of the ten thousand
soldiers of Enies Lobby.

73
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,457
Conveniently, we were
already preparing

74
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,660
a prison transport ship.

75
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,828
What perfect timing they have!

76
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,264
Along with Cutty Flam, they'll
make a wonderful addition

77
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:41,234
as the latest inmates
of Impel Down.

78
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:02,490
Hold on!

79
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:03,491
That wasn't part
of our agreement!

80
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,793
In exchange for my
cooperation and surrender,

81
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:09,596
you promised that you'd let
the Straw Hats escape safely!

82
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:22,709
Come now!

83
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,445
What are you getting
so worked up about?

84
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:25,579
Lucci!

85
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:29,083
Remind her of the exact
conditions that were offered!

86
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,517
The terms of the
arrangement were,

87
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,287
that excluding Nico Robin,
the Straw Hat Pirates

88
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,723
would be allowed to
leave Water 7 safely.

89
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:36,824
Correct.

90
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,425
There you have it.

91
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,229
Fairly straightforward, I'd say.

92
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:50,170
After allowing them
to leave Water 7 safely,

93
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:54,374
as promised, the Straw Hats
decided to come here.

94
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,511
Is this some kind of joke?

95
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,647
You're going to break
the heart of our agreement

96
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,683
over a ridiculous technicality?

97
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,219
These dirtbags are
the lowest of the low.

98
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,821
Not a shred of decency
in any one of 'em!

99
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,156
Huh?

100
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,092
What did you say?

101
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,361
Shut up, you
filthy piece of trash!

102
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,696
We're not under any obligation

103
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,132
to keep our promises
to a bunch of criminals!

104
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,466
You hear me?

105
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,102
Take that, and that, and that!

106
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,169
You, too!

107
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,807
Don't get cocky
with me, understand?

108
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,275
Deceiving and capturing pirates

109
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,477
is what the Navy does,
you insolent wench!

110
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,746
You're just the
idiot who fell for it!

111
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:51,832
You coward.

112
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,502
Still running that
mouth of yours, I see.

113
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,369
Rest assured.

114
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,604
I'll choose a
fitting death for one

115
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:02,442
who's spent her life lying,
deceiving, and betraying others.

116
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:14,255
Before the supreme power of
justice, resistance is futile.

117
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,723
But look on the bright side,

118
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:19,693
at least your friends will
suffer and die with you!

119
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:23,163
Hurry!

120
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,565
Don't let him escape!

121
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:25,633
He's alone!

122
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,234
Surround him!

123
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:30,404
Get him!

124
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,540
Move!!

125
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,343
Get outta my way!

126
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,782
Stupid bastards!

127
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:44,218
Commander!

128
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,387
This guy's really scary!

129
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,688
Don't falter, men!

130
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,657
Bring him down!

131
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,757
Attack!

132
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,628
Commander!

133
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,634
There! Yep!

134
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,070
That dead end's
gotta be the place!

135
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,505
They better not
have taken you away yet!

136
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,176
Robin!

137
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,647
I suppose that's enough for now.

138
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,214
You two!

139
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,449
Get them out of here.

140
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,516
Yes, sir!

141
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,053
There's a Sea Prism Stone
lock on her restraints.

142
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,487
Make sure it's secure.

143
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,256
Cutty Flam goes to Impel Down

144
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,491
and Nico Robin to
Navy Headquarters.

145
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:25,793
As soon as the ship's ready,

146
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,495
we'll set sail through
the Gates of Justice.

147
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:29,363
Right!

148
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,330
It shall be done, sir!

149
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:35,069
Also, take extra
precautions with Cutty Flam.

150
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:38,539
He can be extremely violen--

151
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,041
Has Straw Hat been sighted?

152
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,144
Yeah.

153
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:47,448
We got a report about it a
little while back, chapapa.

154
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,717
When he heard the news,
Chief got so worked up.

155
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,418
It was embarrassing.

156
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,320
They said there were
only five casualties,

157
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,155
but that can't be right.

158
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,528
The receiver is off the hook.

159
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:05,065
Don't give us any
trouble, tough guy.

160
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,266
Let's get going.

161
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,047
You can return to
your quarters for now.

162
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,048
Thanks to this catch,

163
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,751
CP9 will be the toast
of Navy Headquarters.

164
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:27,054
Our status will rise
to incredible heights,

165
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,756
in a covert way, of course.

166
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:29,757
And for that,

167
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,559
I'd like to propose a
little toast of our own!

168
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,531
I'm not in the mood
for some ridiculous toast.

169
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:43,037
Nor am I interested in our
status or political influence.

170
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,605
Our brand of justice
is to assassinate

171
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:46,807
in the name of the
World Government.

172
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,774
As long as they continue

173
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:50,578
to recognize you as
the commander of CP9,

174
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:54,214
we will fulfill our
duty to the letter.

175
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,550
But we're under no obligation

176
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:00,454
to support your
personal ideologies.

177
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:03,591
That's--
That's a sound argument.

178
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:06,526
But then, what is
it you want exactly?

179
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,666
Perhaps all that
we seek is blood.

180
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:26,746
And with CP9, we have
the privilege to kill.

181
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:31,485
These guys give me the creeps.

182
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:36,190
Like he said, they assassinate
legally in the name of justice.

183
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,392
And they're very
good at what they do.

184
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,427
Quite dependable.

185
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,630
As long as I have
them working for me,

186
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:44,498
there's nothing
I can't accomplish!

187
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,533
I'm invincible!

188
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:19,532
Hey!

189
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:22,469
What's all that commotion about?

190
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,410
Something's coming!

191
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,391
Way to go, Sodom and Gomorrah!

192
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,526
Keep charging forward!

193
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:49,730
Oh, no!

194
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:50,864
It's them!

195
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,601
Those pirates that broke
through the Main Island's Gate!

196
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:54,435
Fire!

197
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:56,170
Don't let up!

198
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,605
Gero, Gero!
Gero, Gero!

199
00:13:57,638 --> 00:14:00,174
Unless you wanna die,
get outta the way!

200
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:00,741
Take that!

201
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:01,775
And that!

202
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:06,279
Fall back and then
restore formation!

203
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,016
Damn!

204
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:09,649
Stupid pirates!

205
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,018
You shouldn't be so cocky!

206
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,627
Now I've got you, pirate lady!

207
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,203
Get outta here!

208
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,037
Beat it!

209
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,438
Smooth sailing.

210
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,073
These two make it easy.

211
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:36,109
Keep going until we reach
our Captain, King Bulls!

212
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:46,220
Damn!

213
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,755
There's so many of them!

214
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:50,490
There's no end to
these stupid Marines!

215
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,659
They boxed me in!

216
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,096
He's headed your way!

217
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:56,797
There he is!

218
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,198
Capture him!

219
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,134
Don't let him go any further!

220
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,270
I need to find out where
they're holding Robin and fast!

221
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:06,173
But I can't keep looking
with these guys in the way.

222
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,375
Attack him from both sides!

223
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,412
He went down that alleyway!

224
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:12,546
After him!

225
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,220
He's fleeing to the rooftop!

226
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:29,096
Halt!

227
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:29,530
Whoa!

228
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:30,230
What the heck?

229
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,333
These guys are really stubborn.

230
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:33,667
You won't escape this time!

231
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,035
End of the road!

232
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:35,702
Fine.

233
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,238
I'll get there in one shot!

234
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,040
Now Gum Gum.

235
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,409
Surrender, Straw Hat!

236
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,777
Stop him!

237
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,647
Rocket!

238
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,381
See ya!

239
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,118
Damn!

240
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,653
I hate that guy!

241
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:55,823
Don't let those
pirates go any further!

242
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,691
Stop them!

243
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,793
Bring down every
last one of them!

244
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,595
Keep firing!

245
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,463
Send those marines packing!

246
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,770
Whoa, really?

247
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,647
Stupid bastards!

248
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:25,552
Oh.

249
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,254
Oh, I see.

250
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,292
Understood!

251
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,728
So then, when Sodom
and his brother Gomorrah

252
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,364
were about to die in
the belly of a Sea King,

253
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,133
the Franky Family showed up!

254
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,234
They were rescued

255
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,703
and told these fateful words
that he still remembers:

256
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:46,040
"Look, we're already full
so we're not gonna eat you!"

257
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,175
And from that day forward,
the two brothers swore

258
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,378
their undying loyalty
to their savior, Franky.

259
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,481
So let me get this straight.

260
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,284
The Franky Family brought
down a Sea King, ate it,

261
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,419
and they just
happened to be saved

262
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:01,355
because Franky
was already full?

263
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,190
Pretty much.

264
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:03,724
Fine.

265
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,292
Whatever.

266
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,427
You mind watching
where you're going?

267
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,094
You're making me nervous.

268
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:14,100
"I will follow Big Bro Franky
until the day I die!" he says.

269
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,535
I bet he's really happy

270
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,005
that one of us can
understand what he's saying.

271
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,682
He said "By the way,
the masked guy

272
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,751
that was with you never
made it on board my back.

273
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,118
Is that okay?"

274
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,194
He's talking about Sniper King!

275
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,362
Where is he?

276
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,599
Why now? Why now?

277
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:46,433
Idiot.

278
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:47,635
Did he fall off?

279
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:48,469
Didn't you hear?

280
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,571
He hasn't been
here from the start!

281
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:51,605
Don't tell me.

282
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,306
Did he run away again?

283
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:03,017
Move it!

284
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,385
Get out of the way!

285
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:05,686
Arrogant pirates!

286
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,289
You can't keep this
foolishness up forever!

287
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:11,124
Stand aside and let us pass!

288
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:14,762
If you wanna pass, you'll have
to go through me to do it!

289
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:16,630
Fine then!

290
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,765
Attack!

291
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,604
Is that really the
best you've got?

292
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,073
Battleship Cannon!

293
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,446
Come on!

294
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,614
There's only three of them!

295
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,148
Do something!

296
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:45,525
So, you're good at
fighting, aren't you?

297
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,129
Then you can beat
those guys, huh?

298
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,630
You bet.

299
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,310
We'll get her back.

300
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,445
We just needed motivation.

301
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,315
Now that we know
Robin needs saving,

302
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,650
there's no limit to what Luffy

303
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:12,118
and the rest of our
crew can accomplish!

304
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:18,058
I'm gonna beat up
every last one of them!

305
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,594
There's a new move I wanna try!

306
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:24,064
I believe in him.

307
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,465
He can do it.

308
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:26,566
Go!

309
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,435
Get that rope guy!

310
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,739
Not gonna happen!

311
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:36,043
Shrouds and Ratline Knot!

312
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:38,545
We're done for!

313
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:41,048
Consider this a dead end.

314
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:42,282
Give up and go.

315
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,351
Lieutenant Commander!

316
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,619
Terrible news!

317
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:46,253
What is it?

318
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,321
It's Straw Hat Luffy, sir!

319
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,527
We can't find him anywhere!

320
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,128
He gave us the slip!

321
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,663
That's impossible!

322
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,133
We've got thousands of
Marines here looking for him!

323
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,268
Even so, no one can find him!

324
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,269
Don't tell me.

325
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,672
Is he somehow already
inside the courthouse?

326
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:05,906
No!

327
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,009
Not even an insect could've
gotten past our defenses, sir!

328
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,711
Go!

329
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:13,580
We must find Straw Hat
at any cost, men!

330
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:22,556
This is the last building.

331
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,624
She's gotta be here.

332
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:29,596
Right.

333
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,066
But there isn't a bridge.

334
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,500
Looks kinda far, too.

335
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,167
Oh well.

336
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,669
Guess I'll try jumping over.

337
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:42,376
What the heck?

338
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,411
Air Door.

339
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,654
Hey!

340
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,657
You're the bull who's working
with that stupid pigeon guy!

341
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,626
There seem to be
some discrepancies

342
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:01,428
between the report
and the actual situation.

343
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,128
Whoa!

344
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:03,764
How'd you just appear like that?

345
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:05,099
Awesome!

346
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:06,133
Magic?

347
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,202
To be honest, it did
seem a little suspicious.

348
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:10,571
No way you only
took out 5 marines.

349
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,673
Man, you really surprised me!

350
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:15,142
An invasion like
this is unprecedented.

351
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:18,045
This is the furthest
anyone has ever infiltrated

352
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:20,347
into the mouth of
the World Government.

353
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,016
But that ends here.

354
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:35,229
Outta my way, bull.

355
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:36,130
Tell me.

356
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:40,133
How long do you plan
to keep fighting?

357
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,281
Until I die.

358
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:15,262
Get outta my way.

359
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:17,498
Listen, boy, do you have
any idea what it means

360
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,833
to challenge the power
of the World Government?

361
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,201
Blah blah blah.

362
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:21,901
Whatever!

363
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:23,404
I'll deal with that stuff later.

364
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:24,338
Fool.

365
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,373
You still believe
you'll have a future?

366
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,510
All I care about is
