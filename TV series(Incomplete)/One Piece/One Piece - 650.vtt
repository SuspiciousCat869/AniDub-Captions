00:01:28.377 --> 00:01:32.018
[cackles] My darkness
will swallow the world,

00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:34.388
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:36.292
You think I’ll lose to you?

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:38.463
I’m gonna be King
of the Pirates!

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:42.739
Roger’s treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.955
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.988 --> 00:02:46.233
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.336
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.977
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.915
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:56.286
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.857
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.694 --> 00:03:03.132
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D.
Luffy, a boy whose body

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:05.470
became rubber after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:09.045
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:13.286
I’m gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.198
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:22.706
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.910
Their current objective
is to destroy

00:03:24.943 --> 00:03:28.751
a man-made Devil Fruit Factory
in the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:30.621
When Luffy hears about
a fighting tournament

00:03:30.654 --> 00:03:33.226
at the Corrida Colosseum
with the Flame-Flame fruit

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.533
as the prize, he decides
to join and compete against

00:03:36.567 --> 00:03:40.073
titanic contenders from
all over the New World.

00:03:40.107 --> 00:03:41.109
[LUFFY]
A punch?

00:03:41.142 --> 00:03:42.946
That’s why you’re
so bent outta shape?

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.752
Come on! I can’t even
remember how many times

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:47.221
I got slugged by him!

00:03:47.254 --> 00:03:49.325
[CHIN JAO] Then I’ll finish
the job and pulverize

00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:51.062
every bone in your body!

00:03:51.096 --> 00:03:53.466

He bested a living legend!

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:39.225
After a hard-fought battle, we
have a champion for Block C.

00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:42.264
Let’s hear it for Lucy!

00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:44.603

Our winner from Block B.

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:31.864
The irreverent leader
of a pirate crew

00:05:31.897 --> 00:05:33.568
called the Barto Club:

00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:36.439
Bartolomeo the Cannibal!

00:05:36.472 --> 00:05:39.445

00:05:39.478 --> 00:05:42.284
And now, from Block C.

00:05:42.317 --> 00:05:47.027

[CROWD cheers]

00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:54.441
[GYATS] The long-anticipated
finale is fast approaching!

00:05:54.475 --> 00:05:57.181
Unfortunately, as the arena
needs immediate repairs,

00:05:57.214 --> 00:06:00.588
the battle for Block D will be
delayed by about 15 minutes.

00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:01.857
Sorry, folks!

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.527

00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:05.096
[MAN B]
After all that buildup?

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.803
[GYATS] We appreciate your
patience as we prepare

00:06:07.836 --> 00:06:10.273

[CAVENDISH grunting]

00:06:36.894 --> 00:06:39.231
[COMPETITOR F] Cavendish doesn’t
know when to quit, does he?

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:40.534
Huh?

00:06:42.738 --> 00:06:44.375
[BARTOLOMEO]
I warned him!

00:06:44.408 --> 00:06:45.745
What is his deal?

00:06:45.778 --> 00:06:47.782
I dunno, said something
'bout "“Straw Hat."”

00:06:47.816 --> 00:06:50.555
Oh, you mean Straw Hat
as in Straw Hat Luffy?

00:06:50.588 --> 00:06:52.858
The one who couldn’t even
save his brother’s life

00:06:52.892 --> 00:06:55.831
during the War
of the Best, right?

00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:58.302
[COMPETITOR C laughs]
Anybody can get famous

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.708
for not being able
to do something!

00:07:00.742 --> 00:07:02.879
[laughing]

00:07:02.912 --> 00:07:04.616
[yelping] What the hell?

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:06.018
Let go of me, scumbag!

00:07:06.052 --> 00:07:09.091
I’ll have you know that
I happen to be a nobleman

00:07:09.124 --> 00:07:11.763
from the Kingdom of Biggschots!

00:07:11.797 --> 00:07:16.706
[COMPETITOR C whimpering]
Stop! I-I can’t breathe!

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:19.546
Well, that’s funny,
since you had

00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:22.719
enough breath to talk
smack a minute ago.

00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:25.189
[gasps]

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.929
Look here.

00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:30.734
The Great Straw Hat Luffy
is a hero in his own time!

00:07:30.768 --> 00:07:33.339
He’ll be the legend
that defines this era!

00:07:33.372 --> 00:07:35.578
The future King of the Pirates!

00:07:35.612 --> 00:07:38.951
[COMPETITOR C whimpering]

00:07:38.985 --> 00:07:41.388
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:45.363
It’s been over two
years since that day.

00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:51.142
[BARTOLOMEO]
At Loguetown in the East Blue...

00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:53.213
On the same scaffold
where Gold Roger,

00:07:53.246 --> 00:07:55.518
the King of the
Pirates, was killed...

00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:58.824
I heard him shout to the sky:

00:07:59.992 --> 00:08:01.830
Wait and see!

00:08:01.864 --> 00:08:06.339
I’m gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:08:06.372 --> 00:08:10.146
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasping]

00:08:15.023 --> 00:08:17.561
[BARTOLOMEO]
And in that fateful moment...

00:08:30.588 --> 00:08:32.992
[BARTOLOMEO] ...a bolt of
thunder split the heavens

00:08:33.026 --> 00:08:35.063
and saved his life!

00:08:45.918 --> 00:08:47.388
[laughs]

00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:52.230
Hey, I’m still alive!
That’s nice!

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:54.803
[BARTOLOMEO] I witnessed
a true miracle that day!

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:58.511
[BARTOLOMEO laughing]

00:08:58.544 --> 00:09:00.714
[BARTOLOMEO] Ever since then,
I’ve been followin'

00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:03.486
the Straw Hats’
adventures in the news!

00:09:03.521 --> 00:09:08.698
Alabasta! Enies Lobby!
Impel Down!

00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.235
And who could forget...

00:09:11.268 --> 00:09:15.410
...that legendary
showdown at Marineford!

00:09:15.443 --> 00:09:21.590
[BARTOLOMEO laughing]

00:09:21.623 --> 00:09:22.725
[BARTO PIRATE A]
Hey, Boss!

00:09:22.758 --> 00:09:25.197
What should we do with
the soldiers we captured?

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.668
[BARTOLOMEO]
Drown '‘em, I don’t care!

00:09:27.702 --> 00:09:29.972
[BARTOLOMEO] Back home,
I was just a gang leader

00:09:30.006 --> 00:09:33.547
who took over 150 towns,
no big deal.

00:09:33.581 --> 00:09:36.218
But Luffy inspired me
to be great.

00:09:38.455 --> 00:09:41.295
[BARTOLOMEO]
So I set out to sea!

00:09:52.418 --> 00:09:54.555
[COMPETITOR C yelps]

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:57.293
Now, let me see,
where were we?

00:09:57.327 --> 00:09:59.633
Right, you were
making fun of Luffy.

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:01.603
And just what makes you
think you’re anything

00:10:01.637 --> 00:10:04.475
to write home about,
huh, ya jackass?

00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:09.284
How’s about I cut out
your tongue? Huh?

00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:12.157
You will never be
half as good as him!

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.063
Worthless piece of crap!

00:10:15.096 --> 00:10:16.633
Why the hell is
everyone fighting now?

Let go!

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.455
Don’t think so!

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:35.805
Get your hands off
my sword; I’ll kill you!

00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:37.107
Can you just leave me alone

00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:39.545
and let us settle this
crap some other time?

00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:42.150
I’ve been fighting
people all day!

[BARTOLOMEO]
I don’t blame you, pal.

00:11:05.096 --> 00:11:07.669
I’m too nervous to
walk up to him, myself.

00:11:07.702 --> 00:11:10.407
And even if I did,
what would I say?

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.847
Look at that, he really does
have a scar under his left eye!

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.151
He’s even more
amazing in person!

Huh? I can’t see through
all these tears of joy!

Who does that cabbage
asshole think he is?

limb and save Luffy!

just leave me alone?

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.872
Follow me!

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:26.913
Uh, sure! Thanks for the help!

00:13:26.946 --> 00:13:33.292
[TEACH laughs] Well, then that
goes for Shiryu as well!

00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:58.209
I guess so, but I don’t think

00:13:58.243 --> 00:14:01.014
we should take
Aokiji’s word for it.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.496
Eh? Oh. Hey, Captain,
I’m sorry. One second.

00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:10.266
Straw Hat’s here.

00:14:10.299 --> 00:14:15.844
[TEACH grunts]
Huh? Really now? Put him on!

00:14:18.382 --> 00:14:20.821
[TEACH]
Hello there!

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.166
You again.

00:14:29.673 --> 00:14:33.313
So you’re... Blackbeard?

00:14:33.346 --> 00:14:38.757
[laughs] Long time no see,
Straw Hat Luffy.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.895
Hey, I know how ya feel.

00:14:40.928 --> 00:14:44.468
I was surprised to hear you were
my commander’s baby brother.

00:14:44.502 --> 00:14:47.240
[TEACH chuckles]
You sure you wanna be here?

00:14:47.274 --> 00:14:49.311
You’re gonna miss the big show.

00:14:49.344 --> 00:14:54.789
Don’t ya wanna be there for your
brother’s execution? [laughs]

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.498
What do you want?

00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:04.976
[TEACH] It’s been a while,
hasn’t it, old friend? [laughs]

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:10.386
I heard you’re competing in the
gladiator tournament, "“Lucy"”!

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.658
[TEACH] But forget about
the Flame-Flame fruit.

00:15:12.691 --> 00:15:14.962
Burgess is gonna win that, easy!

00:15:14.995 --> 00:15:16.866
[BURGESS laughs]

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.471
[TEACH] I wanted Ace to join
the Blackbeard Pirates

00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:22.377
back in the day,
but he turned me down!

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.416
So this way, I can have
the next best thing.

00:15:25.449 --> 00:15:26.285
What do ya think?

00:15:26.318 --> 00:15:31.395
[TEACH laughs]

00:15:31.428 --> 00:15:33.265
I’ll tell you what I think.

00:15:33.298 --> 00:15:38.342
You’re never getting Ace’s
power, as long as I live.

00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:43.720
[TEACH]
Huh.

00:15:43.754 --> 00:15:49.464
[laughs] Well, I can’t wait to
make you eat those words!

00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:01.756
We’d better go.

00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:06.600
Lucy!

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.168
Yeah.

00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:13.312
I get the feeling you know
each other, is that right?

00:16:13.345 --> 00:16:17.287
Yeah, kinda. I can’t
let him win that prize!

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.892
[REBECCA pants]

00:16:21.596 --> 00:16:24.267
[LUFFY] Hey, this is good!
Y’got any more?

00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:29.377
You can’t eat
all my free samples

00:16:29.411 --> 00:16:31.582
without buying any!

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:35.557
[REBECCA] Lucy! I’m so
sorry about that, ma’am.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.393
Tell me which one
you’d like to have Lucy.

00:16:37.426 --> 00:16:40.634
Huh?! You mean you’re
gonna pay for it?

00:16:40.668 --> 00:16:44.073
Oh, hello, Rebecca!
Friend of yours?

00:16:45.076 --> 00:16:47.079
[OLD WOMAN A]
Thanks for your business!

00:16:54.996 --> 00:17:00.640
[laughs] Looks good!
Man, am I hungry!

00:17:00.674 --> 00:17:02.210
Enjoy it.

00:17:02.244 --> 00:17:04.582
Sorry I couldn’t afford
to buy you more.

00:17:06.017 --> 00:17:06.987
Are you kidding?

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.658
Thanks for treating me
to lunch, Rebecca!

00:17:10.794 --> 00:17:12.765
So where are we?

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:13.867
[REBECCA]
These are the living quarters

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.271
for the gladiators
who fight here.

00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:21.081
[REBECCA] Though I suppose
it’s more like a prison.

00:17:28.396 --> 00:17:31.301
The guest competitors won’t
be coming down here.

00:17:31.335 --> 00:17:33.640
You can rest up
for your next match.

00:17:35.744 --> 00:17:37.948
Oh, that’s cool, thanks a lot!

00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:44.762
You’re such a great fighter.

00:17:44.796 --> 00:17:47.601
I was really impressed
when I saw that last battle.

00:17:51.776 --> 00:17:53.880
You like it?

00:17:53.914 --> 00:17:56.652
Yeah, the food here
is really good!

00:17:59.659 --> 00:18:01.194
[laughs]

00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:05.069
Oh, hey, you’re not
hungry, too, are you?

00:18:05.102 --> 00:18:06.640
[gasps]

00:18:06.673 --> 00:18:10.246
I’m so hungry.
Mother, I’m starving!

00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:11.582
[SCARLET]
I know, dear.

00:18:11.616 --> 00:18:15.255
Two days is a long time
to wait. I’m sorry.

00:18:16.593 --> 00:18:20.366
You’ll have to stay here alone
for a while, okay, Rebecca?

00:18:22.103 --> 00:18:23.438
[gasps]

00:18:25.511 --> 00:18:30.185
Oh, I don’t get hungry. Ever.

00:18:31.723 --> 00:18:35.664
Well, that’s weird. Are you,
like, a samurai or something?

00:18:35.697 --> 00:18:37.200
[INMATE B grunts]

00:18:37.233 --> 00:18:38.636
[INMATE A]
All right, I got him!

00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:41.107
[INMATE B]
Go for it, Rebecca! Now!

00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:42.343
[LUFFY]
What?

00:18:42.377 --> 00:18:44.549
[INMATE B] That’s why you
brought him here, right?

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:50.392
Rebecca! What is this?

00:18:50.426 --> 00:18:55.370
[INMATE A]
Come on!

00:18:55.403 --> 00:18:56.605
[LUFFY]
Hey, let go of me!

00:18:56.639 --> 00:18:58.175
You better not make
me drop my food!

00:18:58.209 --> 00:18:59.110
[INMATE B]
Rebecca!

00:18:59.143 --> 00:19:00.514
[INMATE A]
Hurry up!

00:19:00.547 --> 00:19:03.854
If you don’t, you’ll never
accomplish your mission!

00:19:03.887 --> 00:19:10.767
Wait, what?

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.674
[REBECCA growls]

00:19:13.707 --> 00:19:16.444
[yells]

00:19:30.807 --> 00:19:32.410
[yelps]

00:19:45.604 --> 00:19:49.745
[panting]

00:19:57.093 --> 00:19:59.531
[INMATE B]
He actually caught Rebecca.

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:02.002
[INMATE A] How did he
move faster than her?

00:20:08.115 --> 00:20:13.927
Go on, do your worst.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.364
I accept my fate, all right?

00:20:16.398 --> 00:20:18.870
Wait a minute, you think
I’m gonna hurt you?

00:20:18.903 --> 00:20:20.206
But you gave me food!

00:20:20.239 --> 00:20:22.711
Yes, but I just
tried to kill you!

00:20:22.744 --> 00:20:25.282
[LUFFY]
Well, you tried to attack me.

00:20:25.316 --> 00:20:30.259
But, kill me? I don’t think so.

00:20:30.292 --> 00:20:33.199
If he can afford to
forgive her that easily,

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.902
that means she was
never a threat to him

00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:40.914
in the first place,
don’t you think?

00:20:40.947 --> 00:20:42.217
[INMATE B]
What a shame.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.987
This woulda been a
good chance to knock out

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.393
one of the competitors who
has Devil Fruit powers.

00:20:47.426 --> 00:20:49.097
Whoa! Mummies!

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:51.368
Oh, come on!

00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:54.976
We’re prisoners, forced
to fight as gladiators.

00:20:55.009 --> 00:20:57.046
[INMATE A]
So is Rebecca.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.518
They throw us out into
the arena for the crowd’s

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:02.891
entertainment till the day
we finally wind up dead.

00:21:02.925 --> 00:21:09.037
All because we got on the
Don Quixote Family’s bad side.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.141
The king promised he
would let us go free

00:21:11.174 --> 00:21:13.779
if we manage to win
a thousand battles.

00:21:13.813 --> 00:21:15.383
But no matter
how strong you are,

00:21:15.416 --> 00:21:18.890
no one can win that many
fights to the death in a row!

00:21:18.923 --> 00:21:20.627
And everybody who’s
tried to run away

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:25.771
up until now has been
shot and killed on sight.

00:21:25.804 --> 00:21:28.509
There’s no hope
left for us now.

00:21:28.543 --> 00:21:31.816
Ten years ago, before
Doflamingo became king

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.522
around here, we had
gladiator matches,

00:21:34.555 --> 00:21:37.493
but never to the death.

00:21:37.527 --> 00:21:39.965
For all the light there is
in this kingdom of his,

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:42.637
there’s just as much darkness.

00:21:50.219 --> 00:21:54.460
[REBECCA] I swear.
No matter what it takes,

00:21:54.493 --> 00:21:59.303
I will win this
competition today!

00:21:59.337 --> 00:22:01.843
And with the power of
the Flame-Flame Fruit,

00:22:01.876 --> 00:22:08.756
I’ll kill Doflamingo!

00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:11.762
Look. The Toy Soldier
told me he’s planning on

00:22:11.796 --> 00:22:14.968
leading his army to attack
Doflamingo today.

00:22:15.002 --> 00:22:18.910
[panting]

00:22:18.943 --> 00:22:23.887
That means he’s going
to let us all out.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.792
I believe that he can
save this kingdom.

00:22:26.826 --> 00:22:30.032
But he wants to sacrifice
his life to do it!

00:22:30.066 --> 00:22:34.307
[KYROS]
It’s all right.

00:22:34.341 --> 00:22:35.910
[KYROS]
Don’t be afraid.

00:22:35.944 --> 00:22:39.885
This brave soldier will
always be at your side!

00:22:39.918 --> 00:22:46.331
[REBECCA panting]

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:52.578
But I will settle this
before he has the chance.

00:22:52.611 --> 00:22:55.750
I’m sick of him always
having to protect me!

00:23:01.161 --> 00:23:02.631
This time, Soldier,

00:23:02.664 --> 00:23:05.503
I’ll protect you. I promise!

00:23:14.555 --> 00:23:17.527
[NARRATOR] On the night that
utter tragedy befell Dressrosa,

00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:20.232
young Rebecca lost
everyone she loved.

00:23:20.265 --> 00:23:22.871
Although she and the
one-legged soldier survived,

00:23:22.905 --> 00:23:25.644
the pair were forced to live
their lives on the run.

00:23:25.677 --> 00:23:28.215
Now, the story behind
the close bond they share

00:23:28.249 --> 00:23:30.319
is finally revealed.

00:23:30.352 --> 00:23:32.056
[LUFFY]
On the next <i>One Piece</i>!

00:23:32.089 --> 00:23:35.830
"“Protect You to the End!
Rebecca and the Toy Soldier!"”

00:23:35.864 --> 00:23:38.602
I’m gonna be
King of the Pirates!
