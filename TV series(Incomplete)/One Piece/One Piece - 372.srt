1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,032
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,502
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:45,173
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:50,211
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:53,281
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,314 --> 00:02:56,651
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:59,087
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,524
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,493
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:08,763
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:11,366
Alright, here I come!

48
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,635
Like an arrow
forged with lightning!

49
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:17,639
Lightning Bone Sword!

50
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:20,208
Gavotte Bond En Avant!

51
00:03:22,644 --> 00:03:25,747
[BROOK] As they say,
mission accomplished.

52
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:27,482
[OARS]
Gum-Gum...

53
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:29,484
Oh, no! He's goin' after Brook!

54
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:32,120
[OARS]
...Battle Axe!

55
00:03:32,387 --> 00:03:34,022
Skeleton!

56
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:40,194
Leave Robin alone!

57
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,770
Now Gum-Gum...

58
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:51,439
This looks bad.

59
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:53,241
Really bad.

60
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,311
[OARS]
...Gatling!

61
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,817
Sanji! Chopper!

62
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:19,434
[LUFFY]
"The Incredible Battle Starts!

63
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,436
Luffy vs. Luffy!"

64
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:40,521
Kushishishi! Kushishishi!

65
00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:45,660
Kushishishi!

66
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:48,830
Let's see. Three left.

67
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:55,436
Now commence with the stomping

68
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,505
and finish them all off.

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,442
[USOPP]
Please no!

70
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,880
What now?

71
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:07,649
We've already thrown
everything we've got at him

72
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,850
and he's still standing!

73
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:10,351
There's gotta be something.

74
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:12,286
C'mon, think, you guys!

75
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,656
Hey, Usopp.

76
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,224
I'll make an opening for you.

77
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:18,326
Here goes nothing.

78
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,728
[USOPP] Wha... Wait,
make an opening for what?

79
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:22,430
Oh. I get it!

80
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:24,132
Well, it's worth
a shot, at least!

81
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:25,633
'Kay!

82
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,503
Hey! What's going on now? Usopp!

83
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:31,572
[OARS]
Gum-Gum...

84
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,276
[OARS]
...Pistol!

85
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,545
--[ZORO] What?
--[OARS] Now Gum-Gum...

86
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:39,714
One Hundred and Eight Caliber...

87
00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:41,749
[OARS]
...Bell!

88
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,238
If one of those
hits me, I'm dead.

89
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:07,375
I can't keep this up.
Is Usopp ready yet?

90
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:14,482
You may be a giant,

91
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:19,320
but Usopp is about to show you
that real men come in all sizes!

92
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:25,526
Hey, pay attention.

93
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:28,629
[ZORO] If it was up to me,
I'd keep fighting you

94
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:32,400
'til I couldn't lift my swords,
but we're almost out of time.

95
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,902
What do you say
we end this right now?

96
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,770
[OARS]
Okay.

97
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:38,406
Kushishishi!

98
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,974
Oh, we'll end this.

99
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:42,343
But be honest, you don't
think you can actually win

100
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:44,912
after that beating
you took, do you?

101
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,947
[ZORO]
Uh-huh.

102
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:50,585
[MORIA] My! We've got a
real optimist here, don't we!

103
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:54,655
[ZORO] I'm pretty stubborn when
I set my sights on something.

104
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,491
Now let's see what you got.

105
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:59,494
Finish me if you can.

106
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,869
This moron's trying
to mess with your head, Oars.

107
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:09,804
Less talking, more pounding!

108
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,708
[OARS]
I know that already!

109
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:15,843
I'll beat him on my own, Master.

110
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:18,913
Just watch me!

111
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,353
[OARS]
Gum-Gum...

112
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:26,320
Zoro!

113
00:07:26,354 --> 00:07:27,421
[ZORO]
One Gorilla,

114
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:28,589
Two Gorilla.

115
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:30,057
Three Sword Style.

116
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,726
...Pistol!

117
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,760
Two Gorilla...

118
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,563
...Slash!

119
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:43,805
I'll get you!

120
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:46,808
Crap!

121
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,676
My arm is stuck!

122
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:52,580
Damn it, argh!

123
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:53,815
[ZORO]
Three Sword Style.

124
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:57,785
Demonic Raven!

125
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,429
[NAMI]
Did... Did he stop him?

126
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:09,831
[ZORO]
Usopp! Now!

127
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,365
[OARS]
Right arm again?

128
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,635
That ain't gonna work!
I told you so!

129
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:20,408
That's enough of you!

130
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,678
[ZORO]
Where did he...?

131
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:28,416
Zoro!

132
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:40,528
There. That's another one down.

133
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:42,663
Hey, Oars!

134
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:47,777
Over here, stupid!

135
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,831
Got him.

136
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,335
The heck was that?

137
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:15,838
It felt like
something in my mouth.

138
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,708
You didn't!

139
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:20,643
You little bastard!

140
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:22,278
Hold on.

141
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,913
What just happened here?

142
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:28,217
I did it. I got him.

143
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:32,188
It's over, you guys!
Oars swallowed the salt!

144
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:35,224
[USOPP]
Yeah! Take that!

145
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:37,159
[USOPP cheering]

146
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,700
[NAMI] Wait. Why is
salt such a big deal?

147
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,969
Oh that's right,
you don't know, huh?

148
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,872
If you feed a zombie salt,
it kicks out their shadow!

149
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:52,375
Just watch! Oars is done for!

150
00:09:57,947 --> 00:09:59,749
That's Luffy's shadow!

151
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:02,385
Oh yeah, you big dumb monster!

152
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:05,388
It's over! Good riddance!

153
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:07,256
You lose!

154
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:37,453
Kushishishi!

155
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,755
You thought you had me, huh?

156
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:43,426
[USOPP]
That was just Moria's shadow!

157
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:44,293
[MORIA]
Gimme a break.

158
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,962
You don't think
I know my own weakness?

159
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:48,464
Kushishishi!

160
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:50,700
It was so hard not to laugh!

161
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,168
Oh, but it was worth it!

162
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:54,437
I was guarding him with
my shadow the whole time,

163
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,907
watching you numbskulls stumble
all over yourselves for nothing!

164
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,744
Too bad! Kushishishi!

165
00:11:01,777 --> 00:11:06,048
Kushishishi! Kushi!

166
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:08,718
I know how important
this salt is to you.

167
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,719
Take it back!

168
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,489
Usopp!

169
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:16,258
Kushishishi! Ahaha!

170
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,293
[NAMI]
You okay?

171
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:19,695
[USOPP coughing]

172
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:22,765
Oh no, the salt!

173
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:24,400
Brook risked
his life to get this!

174
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:28,471
No! No! This is all
we've got! We can't lose it!

175
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:29,305
Damn it!

176
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:32,875
How dare you
make a fool out of me!

177
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:36,979
I'll pick it up and try again no
matter how many times it takes!

178
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:40,516
[OARS]
Gum-Gum...

179
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:43,052
...Stamp!

180
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:44,820
Finish him!

181
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:52,395

of transformation power

took out the rest of the crew?

gonna fight him on your own?

So just to be clear,

you stole a hundred
shadows from the zombies,

then stuffed them
in Luffy's body,

made him so big?

Yes, exactly right.

312
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,705
After that, all the shadows
will go flying out of his body
