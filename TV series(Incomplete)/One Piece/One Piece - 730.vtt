WEBVTT

00:02:34.976 --> 00:02:37.481
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:40.220
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.531
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.936
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.309
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.213
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:55.417
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:58.624
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:02.566
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:04.368
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:08.343
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.443 --> 00:03:12.552
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:19.365
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:22.638
and targeted the Don Quixote
Family in Dressrosa.

00:03:22.738 --> 00:03:25.645
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:28.216
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:30.320
In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.957
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:34.362
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives,

00:03:34.462 --> 00:03:37.502
until at last,
only their leader remained.

00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:39.404
As the struggle continues,

00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:42.445
the razer-sharp threads
of Doflamingo's "Birdcage"

00:03:42.546 --> 00:03:44.415
tear across Dressrosa.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:46.286
Now, the final
countdown begins,

00:03:46.386 --> 00:03:48.023
and Luffy must finish Doflamingo

00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:51.663
before the kingdom and everyone
in it is torn to shreds.

00:03:51.763 --> 00:03:57.308
That mysterious warrior
named Lucy. It was you!

00:03:57.408 --> 00:03:59.879
[LUFFY]
Uh, yeah.

00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:05.423
Doflamingo's about to strike!
Quick, what's your next move?

00:04:05.524 --> 00:04:08.029
Is there anything
I can do to help you out?

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.037
Buy me ten minutes.

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.474
Huh? What for?

00:04:14.576 --> 00:04:16.647
[LUFFY]
Once my Haki comes back,

00:04:16.747 --> 00:04:19.919
I'll give him one good punch,
and that'll be the end of him.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.422
I promise.

00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:24.028
Tell me! Do you really think,
in ten minutes,

00:04:24.128 --> 00:04:27.736
you can beat Doflamingo
and get rid of the Birdcage?

00:04:27.836 --> 00:04:29.806
Hey! Answer me!

00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:37.955
I know I can!

00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:41.262
[COMPETITOR P screams]

00:04:41.362 --> 00:04:44.034
Now, come and face me,
Straw Hat.

00:04:44.134 --> 00:04:46.640
I'll make you regret this.

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:55.858
[LUFFY] "Tears of Miracles!
Mansherry's Fight!"

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:04.074
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:11.590
Doflamingo really wants us dead!

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.995
I can't believe we
used to like that maniac!

00:05:14.095 --> 00:05:15.731
The Birdcage wasn't enough--

00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:18.504
Now he's gotta turn the whole
town into killer strings?

00:05:18.604 --> 00:05:22.110
Even if we live,
Dressrosa is done for!

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.654
Forget about the
buildings and run!

00:05:26.754 --> 00:05:28.256
If we don't get
clear of downtown,

00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:29.826
we're all gonna die!

00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:31.797
The kingdom is like
a battlefield everywhere!

00:05:31.897 --> 00:05:33.967
We're running
out of places to go!

00:05:39.345 --> 00:05:42.284
I ain't dying cause of a bunch
of stupid strings, damn it!

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.789
It's gotta be safe
downtown, right?

00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:50.868
[TOWNSMAN G]
Hey, stop shoving!

00:05:50.968 --> 00:05:53.106
[TOWNSMAN H]
Back off! You're gonna crush me!

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:54.710
I have children, watch out!

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.582
Everyone, stop right there!

00:05:57.682 --> 00:05:59.185
[TOWNSMAN J]
Where are you trying to go?

00:05:59.285 --> 00:06:01.489
[TOWNSMAN K] Hey! Why are you
running this way?

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.660
Downtown is the only safe place!

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.798
[TOWNSMAN L] No!
Downtown is a battlefield, man!

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:06.900
[TOWNSMAN K]
What?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.336
It's not safe?

00:06:08.436 --> 00:06:11.209
Doflamingo is running wild,
looking for Straw Hat!

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:12.678
If you go anywhere near him,

00:06:12.778 --> 00:06:15.083
then you'll get cut up
by giant strings!

00:06:24.001 --> 00:06:25.572
Then we're stuck.

00:06:25.672 --> 00:06:28.409
Where the hell are
we supposed to go?

00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:30.948
Please, King Riku.

00:06:31.048 --> 00:06:34.021
Your kingdom is dying.
Can't you help us somehow?

00:06:53.927 --> 00:06:55.965
[SAI]
How are the fighters holding up?

00:06:56.065 --> 00:06:57.869
[BARTOLOMEO]
Not good! I mean, look at 'em!

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:00.842
They're flat on their backs
and staying that way!

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.047
Even the proud warrior
of Elbaf can't fight?

00:07:04.147 --> 00:07:07.220
This does not bode well
for our chances at all.

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:16.071
[ROBIN]
What's that?

00:07:16.171 --> 00:07:18.075
[gasps]

00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:42.591
Hajrudin!

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:49.171
Here goes. Armament.

00:07:57.621 --> 00:08:01.195
[grunts]

00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:13.954
Do you really think
your swords can

00:08:14.054 --> 00:08:16.125
stop the cage's
movement, Sir Zoro?

00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:18.998
It isn't something that can
simply be pushed back!

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:20.333
How do you know?

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:21.870
[KIN'EMON, KANJURO gasp]

00:08:22.972 --> 00:08:25.845
Rather than telling me it can't
be done, how 'bout you try?

00:08:25.945 --> 00:08:28.183
You wanna die whining?

00:08:28.283 --> 00:08:31.188
At the end of the day,
this is just one man's power.

00:08:31.288 --> 00:08:35.396
So there's no reason to
believe that I can't stop it!

00:08:35.496 --> 00:08:36.733
Your friend speaks the truth.

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:38.603
Yes! Let's go.

00:09:01.616 --> 00:09:03.285

00:09:03.385 --> 00:09:04.655

You guys ready to go?

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.010
[DWARVES]
We're ready!

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.381
[FRANKY]
The factory is Sea Prism Stone.

00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:19.184
It won't get shredded.

00:09:19.284 --> 00:09:21.757
So I want you bros to push it
with everything you've got it!

00:09:21.857 --> 00:09:24.161
[DWARVES cheer]

00:09:24.261 --> 00:09:27.100
Line up!

00:09:28.804 --> 00:09:32.143

Now. It's go time, baby!

00:09:38.757 --> 00:09:40.427
[FRANKY]
Whatcha gonna do?

00:09:40.528 --> 00:09:42.531
[DWARVES]
Push!

00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:45.871
I said whatcha gonna do?

00:09:45.972 --> 00:09:48.677
[DWARVES]
Keep pushing!

00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:54.823
Zoro is pushing the Birdcage?

00:09:54.923 --> 00:09:56.158
[VIOLET]
Yes.

00:09:56.258 --> 00:09:57.662
[ROBIN]
You think it can be stopped?

00:09:57.762 --> 00:09:59.297
It's hard to say.

00:09:59.397 --> 00:10:01.503
I never even really
considered it, quite honestly.

00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:05.309
[ROBIN chuckles] In that case,
let's wish him luck!

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:14.795
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:23.547
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
I'm just doing what

00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:25.050
the Young Master would want!

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.418
[TOWNSMAN P]
Screw you! Get outta the way!

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:27.888
Huh?

00:10:29.391 --> 00:10:30.794
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:34.669
Cocky punk.

00:10:36.906 --> 00:10:38.511
You stay down there!

00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:40.781
This is the new King's Plateau.

00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:43.152
If you're not in
the Don Quixote Family,

00:10:43.252 --> 00:10:45.323
then you aren't
allowed to be here!

00:10:45.423 --> 00:10:47.360
The Executives all
got their asses kicked!

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.930
There is no Family!

00:10:49.031 --> 00:10:50.668
You can't keep the
safest place in the kingdom

00:10:50.768 --> 00:10:51.737
all to yourself!

00:10:51.837 --> 00:10:55.209
Huh? Don't you get it?

00:10:55.309 --> 00:10:57.849
All of you are
condemned criminals.

00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:59.451
The Young Master has decided

00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:02.090
that the kingdom will be
rebuilt from the ground up.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.793
Without you.

[HAJRUDIN panting]
Why am I able to move again?

00:11:54.695 --> 00:11:56.164
It's strange.

00:11:56.265 --> 00:11:59.004
I was injured quite badly,
but I feel fine now.

of it while you can!

Huh?

00:12:02.712 --> 00:12:04.549
This is a life support procedure
that Princess Mansherry

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:06.485
has used on all of Dressrosa.

What do you mean by
"life support"?

to the plateau!

is moving this way!

under control, Luffy.

I'm done for!

00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:55.376
It's pushing back
harder, isn't it?

00:15:55.476 --> 00:15:57.246
So it seems!

00:15:57.347 --> 00:16:00.186
I fear the pressure
may be too much to stand!

00:16:00.286 --> 00:16:03.660
[ZORO] Don't give up!
Put your backs into it!

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:07.133
[yells]

00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:08.503
[KANJURO yells]

00:16:08.603 --> 00:16:10.339
I won't relent!

00:16:26.472 --> 00:16:27.874
One, two!

00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:30.246
[DWARVES]
Push through!

00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:32.517
[ALL gasp]

00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:33.786
What's up?

00:16:35.022 --> 00:16:36.458
We're losing ground!

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:39.331
Even if it's speeding up,
you guys got this!

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:42.370
Keep pushin' and
make those strings cry!

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.711
[INHEL]
Okay! Push!

00:16:45.811 --> 00:16:48.182
[DWARVES]
Push!

00:16:48.282 --> 00:16:51.188
All right! This is
our chance to show off!

00:16:51.288 --> 00:16:53.793
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:17:05.651 --> 00:17:09.157
[DOFLAMINGO]
I'll find you, Straw Hat!

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:14.367
[TOWNSWOMAN E]
Can't anybody help us?!

00:17:14.467 --> 00:17:18.108
We're on our own! We just gotta
keep running for it!

00:17:20.714 --> 00:17:22.217
[NARRATOR]
Only three minutes remain

00:17:22.317 --> 00:17:24.054
until the Birdcage
reaches downtown.

00:17:24.154 --> 00:17:26.058
At which point,
the citizens of Dressrosa

00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:27.928
will be wiped out completely.

00:17:28.028 --> 00:17:29.531
[GYATS]
You gotta be kidding!

00:17:29.631 --> 00:17:32.037
We're never gonna
make it at this rate!

00:17:32.137 --> 00:17:33.372
[NARRATOR]
Four minutes remain

00:17:33.472 --> 00:17:35.243
until Luffy can
use his Haki again.

00:17:35.343 --> 00:17:37.515
Therefore, the other
fighters in Dressrosa

00:17:37.615 --> 00:17:39.619
must find a way to make up
the one minute difference

00:17:39.719 --> 00:17:42.791
before the Birdcage
finishes contracting.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.615
[LOGAN]
What a low-down rotten trick!

00:17:54.715 --> 00:17:56.552
[MEADOWS]
Cheating bastard!

00:17:56.652 --> 00:17:59.424
Is he so scared of Lucy that
he had to change the rules?

00:17:59.526 --> 00:18:01.696
[DAMASK] We gotta do
something in the meantime!

00:18:01.796 --> 00:18:05.036
We'll take down Doflamingo
and kiss that Birdcage goodbye!

00:18:05.136 --> 00:18:10.479
[COMPETITORS yelling]

00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:13.953
[DOFLAMINGO] I made my
message perfectly clear.

00:18:14.053 --> 00:18:18.261
Either you bring me Straw Hat,
or I kill you on the spot.

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:21.434
[COMPETITORS gasp]

00:18:22.537 --> 00:18:25.644
[COMPETITORS scream]

00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:28.583
Barrier!

00:18:33.526 --> 00:18:34.862
[CHIN JAO]
It's holding out!

00:18:34.962 --> 00:18:36.800
Nice work! Thanks, Rooster.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.505
I'm unworthy of your
words of praise, Miss Robin!

00:18:39.605 --> 00:18:42.043
But I swear I
won't let you down!

00:18:42.143 --> 00:18:44.582
All right, guys,
don't make me look bad!

00:18:44.682 --> 00:18:49.692
Keep pushing and
my barrier's got ya! Go!

00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:56.472
[ALL yelling]

00:18:56.573 --> 00:19:00.212
[BARTOLOMEO] We'll do it
just like Mister Zoro!

00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:13.840
Everybody together now!
And push!

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.911
[ALL grunting]

00:19:16.011 --> 00:19:17.213
This is odd.

00:19:17.313 --> 00:19:18.750
They were all terribly injured,

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.622
but now they're exerting
so much strength.

00:19:24.293 --> 00:19:27.066
[ROBIN] A few moments ago, some
of them couldn't even stand,

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:30.239
let alone fight back
against something like this.

00:19:32.376 --> 00:19:35.249
[ROBIN]
What were those fluffy things?

00:19:35.349 --> 00:19:36.986
They're called Dandelixirs.

00:19:37.086 --> 00:19:38.189
What are they?

00:19:38.289 --> 00:19:39.491
An ability.

00:19:39.592 --> 00:19:41.896
Princess Mansherry creates them.

00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:45.436
They're healing flowers that
sprout up from her tears.

00:19:57.861 --> 00:19:59.631
[TOWNSMAN Z]
Wait! I can't run any faster!

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:01.770
You're gonna have to
or you'll die!

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.840
Come on, we don't
want to leave you!

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.409
It's no use!

00:20:05.511 --> 00:20:09.417
I twisted my ankle.
This is the best I can do!

00:20:13.325 --> 00:20:14.762
[MANSHERRY]
Don't give up!

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:18.402
[TOWNSMAN Z]
Okay, let's go!

00:20:18.503 --> 00:20:20.607
[TOWNSMAN AA] Hey! I thought
you twisted your ankle!

00:20:20.707 --> 00:20:24.114
The Dandelixir puffs can
heal people over a wide area.

00:20:24.214 --> 00:20:27.721
Anywhere that they fall, they
bring miraculous recoveries.

00:20:30.527 --> 00:20:32.564
[LEO] Seeing the sad state
that her home is in,

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:34.969
Princess Mansherry is
overwhelmed with grief

00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:36.973
and overflowing with tears.

00:20:37.073 --> 00:20:40.981
But her sorrow can save
a countless number of lives.

00:20:41.682 --> 00:20:45.022
I see. That's why the
injured fighters rose up again.

00:20:45.122 --> 00:20:47.728
[LEO] Unfortunately,
the ability has a drawback.

00:20:47.828 --> 00:20:50.032
Although everyone is strong
and healthy right now,

00:20:50.132 --> 00:20:52.203
the effect is temporary.

00:20:52.303 --> 00:20:53.940
After three minutes have passed,

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.512
everyone'll revert
to their former state.

00:20:56.612 --> 00:20:58.583
So it's a "life support
procedure" designed

00:20:58.683 --> 00:21:01.387
to see us through
this final battle.

00:21:02.524 --> 00:21:04.829
All of a sudden
the pain just went away!

00:21:04.929 --> 00:21:07.366
I can run again! That means
I don't have to die!

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:09.705
This is a miracle--it must be!

00:21:09.805 --> 00:21:13.680
Someone up there in heaven is
looking out for our kingdom!

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.482
[MANSHERRY]
You can do it, Dressrosa!

00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:17.286
Don't give up!

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:24.902
It's not over.

00:21:25.002 --> 00:21:28.042
The light of hope
still shines bright.

00:21:28.142 --> 00:21:30.980
Our kingdom shall never perish!

00:21:35.223 --> 00:21:36.592
Hey, Cub?

00:21:36.692 --> 00:21:38.563
[CUB]
Yes, Princess Mansherry?

00:21:38.663 --> 00:21:41.434
This is the only way
that I can fight.

00:21:43.506 --> 00:21:46.211
I don't know how to
use any weapons.

00:21:46.311 --> 00:21:50.319
And I can't stop the bad guys,
even though I want to.

00:21:50.419 --> 00:21:53.826
All I have are these tears
that never stop.

00:21:53.926 --> 00:21:55.396
Y'know,

00:21:55.496 --> 00:21:58.502
I actually think that's a kind
and honorable way to fight!

00:22:02.644 --> 00:22:05.951
[ATTENDANT B] Gyats. Can we
afford to wait on Lucy?

00:22:06.051 --> 00:22:08.523
People are going to die
if we hold out much longer!

00:22:08.623 --> 00:22:10.660
I'm aware of that,
but I can't send a fighter

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.664
in his condition
back into the ring!

00:22:12.764 --> 00:22:16.104
Until he gets his Haki back,
he's under my protection!

00:22:18.943 --> 00:22:19.945
Huh?

00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:24.020
[COMPETITOR A gasps]
Who is that?

00:22:28.362 --> 00:22:30.567
Whoa! It can't be!

00:22:30.667 --> 00:22:33.840
Trafalgar Law! The Warlord?

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.343
Wait a sec.

00:22:35.443 --> 00:22:37.581
I think you're
running too far away.

00:22:37.681 --> 00:22:39.818
Well, that's, uh, because...

00:22:39.918 --> 00:22:43.425
Is Straw Hat gonna
get his Haki back or not?

00:22:43.526 --> 00:22:45.362
Yeah. It's just...

00:22:45.462 --> 00:22:47.066
He said he needed ten minutes

00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:50.707
and now we've got about
three and a half to go.

00:22:50.807 --> 00:22:53.445
I'll take him under
my care from here.

00:22:53.546 --> 00:22:55.951
Let's go. Every second counts.

00:22:56.051 --> 00:22:57.086
[GYATS]
Yessir!

00:23:00.927 --> 00:23:02.731
[NARRATOR]
Less than three minutes to go

00:23:02.832 --> 00:23:06.905
until the walls of the Birdcage
close completely.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.592
[NARRATOR] In the final moments
before Luffy's recovery,

00:23:16.692 --> 00:23:18.395
the Navy, the coliseum fighters,

00:23:18.495 --> 00:23:20.298
the Tontattas,
and the Straw Hats

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:23.372
all combine their strength
in a desperate struggle.

00:23:23.472 --> 00:23:25.476
But Doflamingo is
still on the prowl,

00:23:25.577 --> 00:23:27.413
and it falls on
Viola and Rebecca

00:23:27.514 --> 00:23:29.350
to buy more time for Luffy.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.087
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.188 --> 00:23:34.795
"As Long as We Breathe!
Stop the Deadly Birdcage!"

00:23:34.895 --> 00:23:37.834
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
