1
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,284
[NAMI]
Zoro!

2
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,388
Where's Luffy?

3
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,823
Wait! You don't...

4
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,425
You don't think that
Zoro killed him, do you?

5
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,429
[NAMI]
No! It can't be!

6
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,502
What happened to the Captain?

7
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,544
Now listen up!

8
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,379
If you plan on
hurting these ladies,

9
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:28,415
then you're gonna have
to go through me to do it.

10
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:38,359
[NOKO determinedly]
BI BAH! BI BOOO!

11
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,360
[CHOPPER] He said,
"I still haven't played

12
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,094
my trump card yet!"

13
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:11,792
[VILLAGE MAN X]
I-I remember! I'm me!! I'm me!

14
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:15,629
I'm myself again. I remember!

15
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,471
Uhm excuse me, Sir,

16
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,607
but aren't you
one of our guests?

17
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,476
Yes! I am!

18
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,212
So why am I dressed
like I work here?

19
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:37,585
Hey!

20
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,086
The manager shouldn't
be acting like a guest!

21
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,654
Get down to the front desk!

22
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,723
So, I didn't imagine it?

23
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,659
I'm the--
I'm really the manager?

24
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:50,798
Mom! Mom!
Where have you been?!

25
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,066
I'm so sorry!

26
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,501
But I'm here now.
Are you okay?

27
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,073
[VILLAGE MAN C] Yes! Our
memories have finally returned!

28
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,581
[VILLAGE WOMAN]
I missed you so much.

29
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:16,390
[DRIM] Everyone!
Listen! There's trouble!

30
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,658
Oh! Hey, it's Drim!

31
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,326
Don't scare us like that!

32
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,395
It's Drim! My son!

33
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,298
[DRIM]
Mom! Mom!

34
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,299
[DRIM'S MOM]
I'm so glad you're safe!

35
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,040
[DRIM]
Mom!

36
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,441
[VILLAGE MAN C] It looks
like everyone's memories

37
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,776
have finally returned.

38
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:36,977
[VILLAGE MAN A]
That's wonderful!

39
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,046
[VILLAGE MAN B] But, what do
you suppose happened to us?

40
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,251
[DRIM] Everyone!
Please! Listen to me!

41
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,586
I saw him!

42
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,222
The one who took our
memories is in the forest!

43
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,256
[VILLAGERS]
Huh?

44
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:07,207
Bi boobooboo baboo!
Boo boo bah boo! Boo baboo!

45
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,642
What's he saying now?

46
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,712
[CHOPPER] "Cut them to
pieces, Roronoa Zoro!"

47
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,681
That's all.

48
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:17,084
See? I knew it! He's being...

49
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,319
He's being controlled
by that thing!

50
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,124
[relieved]
Boooo...

51
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,368
Somebody better do
something, and fast!

52
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,474
Jeez! It never fails,
stupid swordsman.

53
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:45,679
He always has to make everything
so damned difficult! Ughhh...

54
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,183
[USOPP]
Sanji! Be careful!

55
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,487
Bi bah bah boo.
Bibah booboo!

56
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:58,259
[thinking] "This will
buy me the time I need"?

57
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,693
Collier!

58
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,676
Stay out of my way.

59
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,245
You got that? Dumbass cook!

60
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:21,214
Eh? Huh?

61
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:26,386
[LUFFY]
There he is!

62
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:33,426
Zoro!

63
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,142
[CHOPPER]
Are you guys okay?!

64
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,211
Luffy! What the hell?
Why'd you do that?!

65
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,515
Zoro, did you just
call him "Luffy"?

66
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,253
[NAMI]
You got your memory back?

67
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,588
[ZORO]
Of course I did.

68
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,157
[SANJI]
Then stop looking so creepy.

69
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,694
If it really is back,
then act like it, okay?!

70
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:10,297
Put a big smile on
your face, like this!

71
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,467
Hey! Stop it!

72
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,338
My head. Hey! Who am I?

73
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:18,472
Huh?

74
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:21,575
Don't make this any more
complicated than it already is!

75
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,542
[LUFFY]
Oh yeah! Zoro!

76
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,745
You've got a lot of
nerve for what you did!

77
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,280
I don't know
why I even bother.

78
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,818
[NAMI] Good. Now
we're all back to normal.

79
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:31,685
[LUFFY]
Yup.

80
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:33,420
[SANJI]
Realizing that sea horse horn

81
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,690
was the real culprit was
brilliant, Robin, my love!

82
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,459
[LUFFY]
What? So that was it?

83
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,094
[USOPP]
Yes, Luffy, that was it.

84
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,695
You were the first one
to get your memories back

85
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:42,796
and you didn't notice?

86
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,132
[LUFFY ] How rude! At
least I'm better than Zoro!

87
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:45,999
[ZORO]
You little--!

88
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,769
[SANJI] So, where'd that
thing go anyway?

89
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,338
[USOPP]
Did it escape?

90
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,372
[ZORO]
Nope.

91
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,476
It's obvious where it is.

92
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,669
He's right. It just
turned itself blue.

93
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,638
It could've easily
gotten away by now.

94
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,839
Did it really think
it could hide--

95
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:29,376
Bastard! So, you think you
can try to manipulate me, huh?!

96
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,345
I'll cut you up and
serve you for dinner!

97
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,450
[LUFFY] Huh. Really
got to him, didn't it?

98
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,218
[USOPP impersonating NOKO]
"Ha! You won't catch me!"

99
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,588
[USOPP impersonating ZORO]
"Oh, yeah? Just you wait!"

100
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,690
[USOPP impersonating NOKO]
"Hahaha! Too slow, jerk!"

101
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,759
[USOPP impersonating ZORO]
"Jerk?! How about this?!"

102
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:46,693
[USOPP impersonating NOKO]
"I'm over here!"

103
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,096
[USOPP impersonating ZORO]
"What the?! How?

104
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:53,667
[USOPP impersonating ZORO]
I'll slice you to shreds!"

105
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,369
[USOPP impersonating ZORO]
"Ha! There! I've caught you!"

106
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,004
"You won't get away!"

107
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:02,409
Hahahahaha!

108
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,478
You're next,
Usopp! Just wait!

109
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,615
Bi boo boo bi boo boo!

110
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,317
[CHOPPER]
"Now for my last resort!"

111
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,585
[STRAW HAT PIRATE]
Hmm?

112
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,459
Biboo biboo boo boo!

113
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,632
Bi bah bah bah bibah...

114
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,138
[NAMI] No, it can't be!
Is that you? Bellemere?

115
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:42,549
Doctor!

116
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,617
[USOPP]
Kaya!

117
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,355
Are you feeling better?

118
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,607
[LUFFY]
Huh?

119
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,678
[LUFFY]
Whoa!

120
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,782
How are you guys doing?

121
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,554
[ROBIN thinking]
These people...

122
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,660
They must be from
the others' memories.

123
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,032
Bu bah booooo!

124
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,342
You jerks!
Wanna fight! Bring it!

125
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,044
I'll kick all of your
asses at the same time!

126
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,429
[NAMI thinking]
What's going on?!

127
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:10,771
[ROBIN thinking]
Oh, no!

128
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,073
[ZORO thinking]
Dammit! I can't move!

129
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,143
Bi boo boo biboo.

130
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,578
What's it saying now, Chopper?

131
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,813
"Thanks to the interference
of you meddling pirates,

132
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,816
I lost all of the memories
I collected from the villagers.

133
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,785
But the delicious memories
I've gathered from you

134
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:29,123
are enough for me to transform!
Behold, I will become!"

135
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,291
Become what?

136
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:32,292
I have no idea!

137
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,136
Bah bi bah boo.

138
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,474
[CHOPPER] "I'm not going
to miss this opportunity!"

139
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,193
Bi bah boo, boo!

140
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:50,371
[NOKO with deeper voice]
Bi bah boo boo boo!

141
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:54,307
Bi boo boooo... OOO HOOHOO!

142
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,777
What the?! What's that?!

143
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,415
[LUFFY]
And, uh...

144
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,552
And who am I?
And who are you guys?

145
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,588
[CHOPPER]
What the? Who? How?

146
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,663
[LUFFY]
Hey, you! Mr. Drowning Guy!

147
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:16,397
[ZORO]
Huh?

148
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:16,964
[LUFFY]
Do you know who I am?

149
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,365
[ZORO]
No, dumbass!

150
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,669
Bi bi bi boo! Bi bahbah! Boooo!

151
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:24,505
"At last! I'm a
Millennial Dragon"?

152
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:25,572
No way!

153
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:29,343
Awesome! You can tell
what that thing's saying?!

154
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:32,112
Wait! It's a
talking raccoon-dog!

155
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,117
[CHOPPER]
I'm a raccoon-dog?!

156
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,487
A talking raccoon-dog,
and a dragon,

157
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,390
and some random drowning dude.

158
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,692
What's going on here?

159
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:47,728
Somehow, just looking
at that "thing"

160
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,230
is really pissing me off!

161
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,431
Where am I?

162
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:55,336
[thinking] What, how, and
why is all of this happening?!

163
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:58,806
[thinking] Strange, what
am I doing in this place?

164
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,410
[LUFFY]
Cool! Dragon! Must ride it!

165
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,411
Are you crazy?

166
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,480
Besides, there's no way
you can get up there!

167
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,082
Won't know until I try!

168
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,455
[USOPP]
What kind of a freak is he?!

169
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,128
What's going on?
My arms and legs can stretch!

170
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,031
This is fun!

171
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,535
Wow, he actually
made it up there!

172
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,638
What is his body made out of?

173
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:31,739
He's a monster!

174
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:36,644
[sadly]
Booo... Biboo... Bi bah bah...

175
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:40,247
Whoa! What's going on?
Stop bucking around!

176
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:50,291
[USOPP] It looks like
that Millennial Dragon

177
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:52,726
is in some sort of pain.

178
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:56,063
"Let go! I'm losing
the memories!"?

179
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,297
Memories?

180
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,505
[angrily]
BI BAH BOO!

181
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,788
Won't stop, will you?

182
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:29,463
Quit stealing our
memories! You bastard!

183
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:33,267
Bi bah boo! Bi bah bah boo.

184
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,604
What's he saying? Chopper!

185
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:39,573
Chopper? You mean me?

186
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,742
[LUFFY] Yeah! Who else
would I mean? Right?

187
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,781
"I'm finally a
Millennial Dragon!

188
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,750
Don't try to stop me!"

189
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,718
What'd you say?!

190
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,659
People's memories
aren't yours to take!

191
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,694
If you need some for
this transformation,

192
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:04,531
then go out and make some
memories of your own, got it?

193
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:07,368
[NOKO]
Bi bah bah boo! Boo booboo!

194
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:08,369
[CHOPPER]
"Silence!

195
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:11,271
I've had enough of you!
I'm going to end this!"

196
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,745
Gum-Guuuuuuum Pistol!

197
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:29,122
If you wanna fly so
bad I'll send you flying!

198
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,527
[SANJI]
Come on.

199
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,661
Hmm?

200
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,763
You'll catch a cold.

201
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:25,679
I kicked that dragon's ass!

202
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,248
[ZORO]
If I remember correctly

203
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:29,149
aren't Millennial
Dragons hatched?

204
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,818
I mean, don't
they come from eggs?

205
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:32,586
You can't just <i>become</i> one.

206
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:36,457
Yeah, eating memories won't
do anything to change that.

207
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,524
Oh? Is that right?

208
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,827
[USOPP] Sure! You probably
didn't know about it,

209
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,129
but before we came
to the Grand Line,

210
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,764
we saw some with
our very own eyes!

211
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,566
Wow!

212
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,567
[USOPP]
But never mind that!

213
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,069
I'll bet the villagers
are clamoring to see us!

214
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,405
After all, we're the ones who
got all of their memories back

215
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,140
and saved the day!

216
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,609
They're gonna
treat us like heroes!

217
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:58,178
Damn straight!
And heroes need booze!

218
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,481
[SANJI] Already trying to
forget something, are we?

219
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:01,415
Shut up!

220
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:05,085
This hero's hoping
for a big cash reward!

221
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:08,055
A big bronze statue.
That'd be nice.

222
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,590
[thinking] I wonder
if a lap dance

223
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:11,525
would be out of the question.

224
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,494
Hey, Robin!
What would you ask for?

225
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,296
A book, maybe?

226
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,064
Seems right up your alley.

227
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:21,302
Indeed, it is. Maybe a book
about this island's history.

228
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:23,270
[CHOPPER] I knew it!
I want a book, too!

229
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,674
A medical book this thick! Haha!

230
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:29,042
[NAMI]
Look! We can see the shoreline!

231
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,516
[USOPP]
Greetings, island villagers!

232
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:40,421
Well, here we are!

233
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,622
Huh?

234
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:42,689
[NAMI]
Huh?

235
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:48,095
[USOPP] Whoa!
Hold on, what are you?

236
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,763
Them! They did it!

237
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,334
[VILLAGE MAN A]
Everyone, attack!

238
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:54,502
[CHOPPER]
What the heck is going on?!

239
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:57,471
[NAMI] Usopp! I thought we
were supposed to be heroes?

240
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,474
[USOPP] We were! I'm just
as confused as you are!

241
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:01,809
Hey, Nami! Quick!
Where's the waver?

242
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:03,177
We can't leave it behind!

243
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,145
It's over this way! I'll get it!

244
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,046
[VILLAGE MAN B]
Hold it!

245
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,148
Stop right there,
you filthy pirates!

246
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,383
[VILLAGE MAN C]
Memory thieves!

247
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,250
[YOUNG INN MAN]
And you, girl!

248
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:12,486
Get back here and
pay for your room!

249
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,088
What's going on?

250
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,123
They think we
took their memories?

251
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,491
So it would seem.

252
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:21,494
Well, we are pirates.
What did you expect?

253
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,700
[NAMI] They've left
me no other choice!

254
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,772
[VILLAGE MAN B]
Hey! Hold on! Stop it!

255
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,340
[NAMI]
What kind of pirate would stop

256
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,142
just because someone said to?!

257
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,143
[VILLAGE MAN C]
You... Ah!

258
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:51,324
Thank goodness
we made it back.

259
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,329
My bronze statue.

260
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,765
I was so close to getting one.

261
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:00,067
It would have been awesome.

262
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,737
My very own dark,
cool, bronze statue.

263
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:08,208
[USOPP] Oh, man, I'm
glad that's all over.

264
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,345
Losing you memory can
sure cause a lot of trouble.

265
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,279
[SANJI]
You got that right.

266
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,682
Including someone
trying to scheme his way

267
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,551
into making us his pirate crew.

268
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,121
[USOPP] Come on!
Hey! You can still join!

269
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:25,659
What do you say?

270
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,595
There was also a
certain simpleton

271
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:29,563
who allowed his mind
and body to be taken over

272
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,699
by a neurotic sea horse.

273
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:32,766
What?

274
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,734
If you had kept watch
like you were supposed to

275
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:36,337
instead of sleeping,
then none of this mess

276
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,138
would have happened
in the first place.

277
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:39,206
Stupid moss head.

278
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,508
Shut up! I was tired, okay?

279
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,077
Well, if you're that tired.

280
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,478
Why don't you sleep forever?

281
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:47,681
[NAMI] Arrrrg!
Shut it! Enough bickering!

282
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:52,253
Or else you'll be getting
another dose of amnesia.

283
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:54,255
Aww, Come on!

284
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:57,357
Don't say such
mean things, Nami!

285
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:02,596
[thinking]
My memories.

286
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,170
If I really had
lost all my memories

287
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,038
and didn't get them back.

288
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:20,047
What's wrong, Robin? Huh?

289
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,518
Oh, it's nothing!
Just a little tired, that's all.

290
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:27,388
I bet, poor Robin didn't
get to sleep even once

291
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:29,256
during that entire ordeal.

292
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,490
[CHOPPER]
Yeah, that's right!

293
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:34,161
Now, time to start preparing
a special recuperative dinner.

294
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:39,600
What? Dinner?
Good idea! Sanji! Dinner!

295
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,703
[SANJI] I said I'd start
preparing it! Shut up and wait!

296
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:43,571
[NAMI]
Hey, Luffy.

297
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:44,372
[LUFFY]
Huh?

298
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:45,072
[NAMI]
Why weren't you with Zoro

299
00:21:45,106 --> 00:21:46,340
when he found us by the lake?

300
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:51,045
[LUFFY] Oh, well I kind of got
stuck under a boulder Zoro cut.

301
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:52,213
[ZORO]
A boulder?!

302
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:55,181
[LUFFY] Yeah. To be fair,
it was a pretty big boulder.

303
00:21:57,618 --> 00:22:02,622
♪ ending song ♪

304
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,162
[USOPP] Now that things
have settled down,

305
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:17,431
to the next island!
Full speed ahead!

306
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,233
[NAMI] Geez, you sure
are full of yourself!

307
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:20,234
[USOPP] I think
with this incident,

308
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:22,570
you've all learned how
important memories are.

309
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:24,171
[SANJI] Why are you trying
to wrap everything up?

310
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:25,706
[USOPP] Actually, I think
I just remembered something

311
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:26,807
I don't wanna remember.

312
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,043
[LUFFY] Oh, look!
It's Split Head!

313
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,344
[PORCHE and HAMBURG]
Boss? What's wrong?

314
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:32,046
[LUFFY]
On the next <i>One Piece</i> :

315
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,381
"Proud Man! Silver Fox Foxy!"

316
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,616
[USOPP]
Ugh! Him again?
