I don't care if
all that is true.

175
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,240
[NAMI, USOPP]
Huh?

176
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,774
I don't need any other excuses!

177
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,577
I'm still gonna kick
that guy's ass!

178
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,249
[SMOKER]
I see.

179
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,519
So, how do you intend
to get outta here?

180
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,620
[LUFFY screams]

181
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,622
It's all the way up my legs now!

182
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:46,225
[USOPP]
Help! Help! I'm drowning!

183
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,794
Ugh... All of a sudden,
I feel a little...

184
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,597
No! Hey! Wait!

185
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:56,135
Just tough it out! Vivi said
she'd bring some help back!

186
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,937
[NAMI] Vivi, I know you're
doing all you can,

187
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,373
but please hurry back!

188
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,240
[ZORO]
Dammit!

189
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,575
If only my
swordsmanship were better,

190
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,710
I could cut through
this stupid cage.

191
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,612
We'd be free!

192
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,382
[SANJI] It's really impolite to
make a lot of noise at mealtime

193
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,417
like you were doin'.

194
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,552
[ZORO]
Huh?

195
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,293
[SANJI]
I'll teach you how to behave!

196
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,296
Bad Manner Kick Course!

197
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,993
[SANJI]
Hey, guys. Been waiting long?

198
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,361
[BOTH]
Yay! It's Mr. Prince!

199
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,530
We're finally gonna
get outta here now!

200
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,698
Thank you.

201
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,865
Well, don't just stand there!

202
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,300
Find the key and
get us outta here!

203
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,369
[SANJI]
Nami, my dear!

204
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,505
Do you love me now? Huh?
Well? Nami, my sweet...

205
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,707
[NAMI]
Um, sure!

206
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,541
And I'll love you even more

207
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,711
if you hurry up
and open this cage!

208
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,347
[ZORO]
He is one lovesick idiot.

209
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,383
Vivi! All right! Way to go!

210
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,994
[SANJI] More diners
with bad manners, huh?

211
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,295
[LUFFY]
Get 'em, Sanji!

212
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,498
Smash those weird
bananas into pudding!

213
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,136
Don't worry, I'm gonna
teach these bananas

214
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,538
some proper table
manners all right.

215
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,674
Since theirs are so bad
they attacked a lady,

216
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,175
I'll do it the hard way.

217
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,044
I'll take my sweet
time doing it, too,

218
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,079
'cause nobody does that to Nami.

219
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,181
[USOPP] We don't have
any time for chivalry!

220
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,349
One second strikes!

221
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,219
No, make that one
instant strikes!

222
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,988
[SMOKER] The third one who
just came in has the key.

223
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,691
[LUFFY] Hey, how do you
know that, Smokey?

224
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,993
[SMOKER] Guess your ears
aren't as big as your mouth.

225
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,862
Isn't that one's growl
the same as the one

226
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,563
who swallowed the key?

227
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,232
[BOTH]
Whoa!

228
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,040
[LUFFY chuckles]

229
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,043
Uhh, I can't really tell.

230
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,045
[CROCODILE] Smart thinking,
collapsing the bridge

231
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,780
to buy time like that.

232
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,382
There're obviously more Straw
Hats here than we'd thought.

233
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,618
[MISS ALL SUNDAY] So that was
all done to lure us away

234
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,353
so they could
rescue their friends?

235
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,055
[CROCODILE]
Of course it was.

236
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,557
[BOTH]
Key!

237
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,897
[LUFFY]
There it is! Get it!

238
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,066
[ZORO]
Huh?

239
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,200
[USOPP]
Hey, wait a minute!

240
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,636
[LUFFY]
That doesn't look like the key!

241
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,373
[MR. 3]
Wax‐Wax Ball...

242
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,908
...Release!

243
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:49,709
[gasps]

244
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,077
[NAMI, LUFFY, USOPP]
What the‐‐?

245
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,413
Yes! Water! At last!

246
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,215
It's a miracle!

247
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,317
Hey! It's him!

248
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,386
Mr. 3!

249
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,221
Mr. 3?

250
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,224
What was he doing in the
belly of a bananagator?

251
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,761
Woo‐hoo!

252
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:13,432
I'm alive again!
I thought I was a goner.

253
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,767
Stupid Crocodile!

254
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,168
So you thought you
could get rid of me,

255
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,837
but you didn't try hard enough!

256
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,071
The moment I was swallowed,

257
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,341
I used the last of my power
to create that Wax‐Wax Ball!

258
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,411
That was how I survived!

259
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,347
Huh?

260
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,648
A key?

261
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,817
[LUFFY, USOPP, NAMI shouting]

262
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,285
[MR. 3]
Hm?

263
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,954
[MR. 3 screams]

264
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,922
[MR. 3]
Not you guys again!

265
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:40,926
[MR. 3] Wait. Why do
they want this key so bad?

266
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,962
Hold on.

267
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,198
A room that's surrounded by
and flooding with water.

268
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,768
A cage full of Straw Hats.

269
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:52,338
And they're screaming
like mad for this key.

270
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,308
Now I see what's happening here.

271
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,977
Mr. 3, I presume?

272
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,146
[MR. 3 screams]

273
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,313
[MR. 3 pants]

274
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,349
How'd you know who I was?

275
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,785
Well, your hairstyle
gave it away.

276
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,820
I'll take the key. Toss it here.

277
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,388
[MR. 3]
Hm?

278
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,124
[chuckling]

279
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,327
Sure thing! Here goes!

280
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,662
[SANJI]
Hey.

281
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,166
[ALL scream]

282
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,235
[MR. 3 laughing]

283
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,503
[MR. 3]
I don't know who you are,

284
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,071
but if you want
the Straw Hats out,

285
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,373
you're no friend of mine!

286
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,308
You want the key, go find it!

287
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,309
Good luck!

288
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,011
You'll need it with all
those alligators around!

289
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,480
Trust me, I know!

290
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,015
Jerk.

291
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,398
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
So what happens if their rescuer

292
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:56,101
is able to ascertain which
bananagator swallowed the key?

293
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,736
[CROCODILE]
Hmph. Well...

294
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,338
Even if they were
able to get the key,

295
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,873
it wouldn't make any difference.

296
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,741
I've had the real one with me.

297
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,877
The key in the gator's
belly's a fraud,

298
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,213
but that's for me to know
and them to find out.

299
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,247
You're bad.

300
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,116
[MR. 3] Better find it soon;
that water's rising.

301
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,451
That bastard.

302
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,187
That was a dirty move,
even for that creep!

303
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,790
We're running
outta time! Hurry!

304
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,026
Lousy, good‐for‐nothing wax guy.

305
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,894
[USOPP]
Huh?

306
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,196
Wait a minute, Sanji!

307
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,764
He might be good
for something,

308
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,534
like using those wax
powers to make a key!

309
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,307
You're right.

310
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,775
[MR. 3]
Huh?

311
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,214
[MR. 3 groans]

312
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,482
[SANJI]
Nice work, Candle Man.

313
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,551
Now there are just two
more things to do.

314
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,420
[chuckles]

315
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,488
[MR. 3]
Uh?

316
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,057
[screams]

317
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,328
Let's go. We have to hurry.

318
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,963
Right, we've gotta
stop the rebels

319
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,331
before they attack Alubarna.

320
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,934
We should be able to get
out through that hallway.

321
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:06,005
There's a problem with that!
Namely, dozens of bananagators!

322
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:06,939
[LUFFY growls]

323
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:07,940
[LUFFY]
That's it?

324
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:13,579
I can take on hundreds of
those weird bananas!

325
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,115
Um, that problem's solved.

326
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,851
[VIVI] And I had so much
trouble with just one of them.

327
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,452
No, don't be so
hard on yourself.

328
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,955
Those two just have crazy,
abnormal strength!

329
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:23,989
Yeah?

330
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,293
I'd be even stronger if
I wasn't soaked right now!

331
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,474
Ah! This place is falling apart!

332
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,977
[SANJI]
Yeah, we can see that!

333
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,646
[USOPP] Oh, no! The
passageway's crumbling, too!

334
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,215
[SANJI] We've gotta get
out of here! Right now!

335
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,051
[LUFFY screaming]

336
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,495
All right, Straw Hats!
Time to pay!

337
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,998
If the bananagators haven't
finished you off yet,

338
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,168
you'll wish they had by
the time I'm done with you!

339
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,469
Huh?

340
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,848
[CROCODILE]
This can't be.

341
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,922
[growling]

342
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,938
Hey, you alive there? Luffy?

343
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,042
Usopp! Please! Wake up!

344
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,611
Come on! Just kick your
legs or something!

345
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,014
Hey, help us pull
you outta here!

346
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,950
Jeez, why would a pirate
want Devil Fruit powers

347
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,119
if it means he can't swim?

348
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,391
[SANJI]
What? Smoker?

349
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,558
Hey, Zoro, what are you doing?

350
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,028
In case you forgot,
that guy's our enemy!

351
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,229
[ZORO]
Back off!

352
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,599
I didn't wanna do it, but he
was about to die, that's all!

353
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,234
[SANJI]
Whatever.

354
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,202
We gotta get moving, guys.

355
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,238
We've lost too
much time already.

356
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,940
Vivi, can we still make it?

357
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,042
I don't know.

358
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,543
[SANJI]
Hey, Nami?

359
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,246
You still have that
perfume I bought you?

360
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,082
Huh? Yeah. But why?

361
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,152
Put some of it on, please.

362
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:33,952
'Kay.

363
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:34,920
[SANJI]
Aww, just one whiff of it

364
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,156
makes me swoon like
a schoolboy in love!

365
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,159
[ZORO] Not to mention make
you act like an idiot.

366
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,228
[SMOKER]
Roronoa!

367
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,731
Why did you save my life?

368
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,523
[LUFFY] Zoro! Quick!
You gotta save Smokey!

369
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,624
[ZORO]
What? He's our enemy!

370
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,293
He can take care of himself!

371
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,327
[LUFFY]
No, he can't!

372
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,197
He's got Devil Fruit powers
so he can't swim!

373
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,698
He'll drown if you
don't help him!

374
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,300
[ZORO]
For cryin' out loud, Luffy,

375
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,469
do I really have to do this?

376
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,370
Ah, jeez!

377
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,375
All I did was follow my
captain's orders. That's it.

378
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,545
So, wouldn't read too much
into it if I were you.

379
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,982
It was one of his crazy
whims. Pay it no mind.

380
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,786
[SMOKER] Then you wouldn't
have any gripes with me

381
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:44,156
carrying out my duties
and arresting you, right?

382
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,824
See? I knew this was a bad idea.

383
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:50,395
This is what you get
for saving a Marine.

384
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,403
[MARINE A] They're here?
The Straw Hat Pirates?

385
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,238
[MARINE B]
Yessir, and it looks like

386
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,507
they have Captain
Smoker surrounded!

387
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,841
[MARINE A]
Not for long they won't!

388
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,710
[MARINES]
Yeah!

389
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,348
Yeah! All right!

390
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,749
Full speed ahead to Alubarna!

391
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,852
Where's Crocodile?
Let me at 'em!

392
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,922
[NAMI]
Finally awake, huh?

393
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,825
[LUFFY growls]

394
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,195
[LUFFY gasps]

395
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,430
You want some of this?
Bring it on!

396
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,433
Agh! It's Smoker!

397
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,936
Luffy, forget it! Let's just
get outta here! Come on!

398
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,039
I should. But you
just saved my life.

399
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,746
[MARINE A]
This way! Hurry!

400
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,723
Go.

401
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,459
[SMOKER]
This is the only time

402
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,763
I'm letting you Straw
Hats off, got it?

403
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:01,533
When we next meet,
it's gonna be as enemies.

404
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,711
[MARINE B]
There they are!

405
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,146
[MARINES yelling]

406
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,714

Get 'em!

[laughs]

408
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,952
[MARINE A] Reinforcements have
arrived, Captain Smoker.

409
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,887
Hold on!

410
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,988
Don't let them escape!

411
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,656
[MARINE B]
Cut 'em off!

412
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:29,428
Well, that's our cue. So, Vivi,
which way to Alubarna?

413
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,497
That way! Due east
across the desert!

414
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,967
[MARINE A]
They're running! After them!

415
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,669
Luffy, c'mon! What are you
doing? Aren't you coming?

416
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,937
Yeah.

417
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,680
[MARINE A]
They won't escape us, men!

418
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,983
[MARINES]
Yeah!

419
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:51,850
[chuckles]

420
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,786
Hey. You're not such
a bad guy, Smokey!

421
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,521
[SMOKER]
Huh?

hell outta here, Straw Hat?

[LUFFY laughing]

426
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,871
[ZORO]
Heh.

427
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,679
[MARINE A]
Don't worry, Captain Smoker!

428
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,548
We won't let those
pirates get away!

429
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,728

are hot on our heels!

All right, guys!

431
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,633
We got lots to do so
we're not gonna stop

432

till we get to Alubarna!

433
