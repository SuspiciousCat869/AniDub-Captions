1
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:59,753
So soft! Yummy!

2
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,820
Whoa, really?

3
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,190
[PAULIE] Sorry, but you're
not making any sense.

4
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,258
[MIKAZUKI]
Need me to talk slow for you?

5
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,628
Here's the deal.

6
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:11,599
I'm not paying a single
berry for the work you did.

7
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,301
[MIKAZUKI CREW A] Thanks for
the repairs, they were great!

8
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,503
Listen, Sir, we take
our jobs very seriously.

9
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,206
It's not wise to mock
our shipwrights like that.

10
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,743
Oops. Sorry.

11
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,220
You're on shipwright turf.

12
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,121
This is what
happens when you try

13
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,656
to pull that pirate
crap around here.

14
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,260
[NAMI] It's that tower
right ahead of us.

15
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,238
Everything's huge! So cool!

16
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,208
[BUSYBODY MAN D]
They're strong.

17
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,243
They're skilled.

18
00:02:56,276 --> 00:03:00,180
And they're the pride of
every citizen in Water Seven.

19
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,754
Scary!!

20
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,624
[CHOPPER]
What is that guy selling?!

21
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:11,659
It looks creepy!

22
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,027
[ROBIN]
It's just a mask shop.

23
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,337
[BLUNO]
CP9

24
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,044
[CHOPPER]
Robin?

25
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,195
[ZAMBAI] Pity, I was hoping
we could kill you in your sleep.

26
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,676
You got a lot of nerve.
Who are you?

27
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:18,559
You don't know
who we are?! Really?

28
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,428
'Cause we sure know
you, Pirate Hunter!

29
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,766
[ZAMBAI] Babies stop crying
when they hear our name!

30
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:29,103
A collection of bounty hunters.

31
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,106
We are The Franky Family!

32
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,107
Now, if you don't mind,

33
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,142
I think we'll be taking
that 60 million bounty

34
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,610
you've got on your head.

35
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,511
When we're done with you,

36
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,513
we'll wait inside
that cabin of yours

37
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,449
and ambush the rest of your
crew when they get back!

38
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,051
Hahahaha!

39
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,720
We're gonna be rolling
in the dough in no time!

40
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,223
It's my lucky day!

41
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,195
Lucky, huh?

42
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,233
We'll see about that,
now won't we?

43
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,179
Two-Sword Style.

44
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,347
Rhino...

45
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,015
...Cycle!

46
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,454
[sighs]

47
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,327
Back to sleep.

48
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,531
Ah... man!

49
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,610
[NAMI]
This is the place.

50
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,786
Hey, whatever you
want, make it quick.

51
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,355
We're kinda busy right now.

52
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,456
We need to cash in our stuff.

53
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,228
How much you think it's worth?

54
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,297
Ahhh!!

55
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,766
[panicked] Boss,
come here quick! Ah! Ah!

56
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,769
G-Gold! This much!
No, this much!

57
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,138
Then why are you wasting
your time talking to me?!

58
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,207
Escort them to the
VIP room right now!

59
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,642
We can't afford to
lose this deal, got it?!

60
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,047
[LUFFY]
Wow! Comfy!

61
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,248
After we cash in our gold,

62
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,783
we gotta get one of
these for the Merry.

63
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,151
I could bounce on this all day!

64
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,229
[USOPP] Hey you're not
saying anything.

65
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,231
Don't tell me you
think this stuff is fake!

66
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,298
[OWNER MAN A]
No, far from it!

67
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:41,635
I've been an appraiser
for 25 years, so I'd know!

68
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,774
This treasure is valued at...

69
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:50,044
[LUFFY]
O-One hundred million Berries?!

70
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:50,978
[USOPP]
Keep it down, stupid!

71
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,346
You want the whole
city to know how much

72
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,814
cash we're lugging around?!

73
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,317
[LUFFY] You're really gonna give
us that much money, mister?!

74
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,418
[USOPP]
Play it cool, Luffy!

75
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:00,220
You gotta handle these
things like a professional!

76
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,154
[OWNER MAN A]
It may sound like a lot,

77
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,756
but that's most
certainly what it's worth.

78
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,627
It has historical value
and high purity.

79
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,162
With a hundred
million we can make

80
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,830
the Merry even
better than before!

81
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,166
[USOPP] No kidding! And we'll
have plenty to spare!

82
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,069
Then we'll spend the rest of on
a big statue to put on the deck!

83
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,237
[LUFFY]
No. No, we won't.

84
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,304
[OWNER MAN A]
Well that's wonderful,

85
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,639
I'm glad you
accept the amount.

86
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,075
Now I need you thumbprint
and signature here.

87
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,245
After that, I'll prepare
your money lickety-split.

88
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,313
[LUFFY] You can have both
my thumbs if you want 'em!

89
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,114
[USOPP]
Mine, too!

90
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,583
The more thumbs
the better, right?

91
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,829
What's up?
Giving him a toe print?

92
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:42,997
Before we sign anything,

93
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,435
there are three things I'd
like to say. Mr. Appraiser.

94
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,105
First, I forgot
to mention this

95
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,107
but he's got a one hundred
million bounty on his head.

96
00:07:54,775 --> 00:08:00,047
Second, I don't accept
the appraisal you gave us.

97
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,617
Third, if you try
to lie to us again.

98
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,554
It'll be the last lie you
ever tell. You got that?

99
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,692
[OWNER MAN A]
Please forgive me!

100
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,194
Three hundred million?!

101
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,397
This is like a dream come true!

102
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,232
Skypeia paid off after all!

103
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,067
I never thought
I'd see the day!

104
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,136
Y'know, I always
wanted to be filthy rich!

105
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,704
It's our money, too!

106
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,039
[OWNER MAN A] Uh... p-pleasure
doing business with you.

107
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:26,206
[USOPP]
I don't feel comfortable having

108
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,175
all this money in
one place, guys!

109
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,544
It's scary!
I mean, what if I trip

110
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,013
and it all falls
out or something?

111
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:37,217
That was great! You sure
were scary back there, Nami!

112
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,353
I estimated 300
million from the start,

113
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,455
but I figured he
wouldn't give it up easy.

114
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,357
You really gotta work
on your game face.

115
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,358
Good thing I was there.

116
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,359
Cut it out!

117
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:48,329
You're making me nervous
swinging that around!

118
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:52,165
Well, whatever, we got our money
now and that's what matters.

119
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,535
Aaaahhh!

120
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,303
You dropped it!

121
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,305
Don't let it fall in the river!

122
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:05,178
Phew! That woulda been bad
if the money got wet, huh?

123
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:10,083
If you lose my money,
you're paying in blood!

124
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,254
I'm sorry. V-Very sorry.

125
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,756
So please don't
break my face anymore.

126
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,160
[FRANKY FAMILY NONECK]
Whoa, did you hear that?

127
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,061
Sure did!

128
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,596
That's 300 million
Berries down there!

129
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,832
Ain't no doubt about it,
those are the Straw Hats.

130
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,367
I thought grabbing their bounty

131
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,702
was a sweet deal,
but this is way sweeter.

132
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,569
If we meet up with the rest

133
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,804
of the gang and
get 'em to help us out,

134
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:34,208
we can make twice the money
with only half the hard work!

135
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,277
Hahahaha!

136
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,947
[USOPP]
I dunno, Nami.

137
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,684
Maybe we should take the cash
back to the ship after all.

138
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,552
[NAMI] That'd be a
complete waste of time.

139
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,588
The shipyard is right
around the corner.

140
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,190
Come on. You don't
have to ride so far away.

141
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,424
Let me play
with the money.

142
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,528
Anyway, we'll probably head
back to the Merry soon enough.

143
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,796
After we meet
with the shipwrights,

144
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,531
I'm sure they'll need
to look at the damages

145
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,300
before they can
give us a quote.

146
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,634
I didn't think of it that way.

147
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,770
I guess I can watch
the money 'til then.

148
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,205
I've never carried so
much cash at once, that's all.

149
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,540
I don't know how to handle it.

150
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,275
[NAMI]
Well, that's only natural.

151
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,309
Just don't flail it around

152
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,478
and throw it in any
rivers and you'll be fine.

153
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,647
[LUFFY] Ooh! They're selling
water buns over there!

154
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,748
Let's buy a hundred of 'em!

155
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,749
[NAMI and USOPP]
Shut up.

156
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,349
[LUFFY]
How 'bout a thousand?

157
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:16,917
[NAMI and USOPP]
Shut up.

158
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,517
[LUFFY]
How 'bout--

159
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:17,984
[NAMI and USOPP]
Shut up.

160
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,253
[LUFFY]
Okay.

161
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,719
Right. Back to the shipyard.

162
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:54,688
And it looks like the
crowd's cleared out, too.

163
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,057
[USOPP chuckles]
Well, that's good.

164
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,258
We have enough to deal

165
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,661
with without the shipwright
fan club getting in the way.

166
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,563
[LUFFY] All we gotta do
is find that ice guy.

167
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,833
Uh wait. What's
his name again?

168
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,301
[NAMI]
It's Iceberg.

169
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,403
Oh yeah, now
I remember... Ice Pops.

170
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,804
The old lady back at
the train station said

171
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,439
that's who we
needed to talk to,

172
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,607
but now that
I think about it,

173
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,409
we don't know anything
about him, do we?

174
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,710
Well, it's the
only lead we've got.

175
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,479
I don't know even
how this place works.

176
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,681
Is it okay to
just walk right in?

177
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,349
[LUFFY]
That's what I'm doing!

178
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,050
[NAMI and USOPP]
Not again.

179
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,321
Hold it right there.

180
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,389
[KAKU] You've got
a lot of gumption

181
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,590
just waltzing in like that.

182
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,060
[KAKU] Why don't we
take a step over here.

183
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,629
Then we can talk.

184
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,331
Don't worry. It's not personal.

185
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,699
You're outsiders is all.

186
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,034
So you're not allowed
inside the plant.

187
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,604
[KAKU]
Upsey daisy.

188
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,678
All right champ, what brings
you to the docks today?

189
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,580
C'mon Usopp, I know it's you.

190
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:55,482
I'm right here, Luffy. Idiot!

191
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,751
Oh, now that I look
at it, his nose is square.

192
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,754
[LUFFY] That means he's
square Usopp! Awesome!

193
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,790
[USOPP]
I'm the only Usopp. Stop it.

194
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,725
Anyway that aside.

195
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,760
We came here to see
Iceberg, if that's all right.

196
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:10,664
Hmm... Is that so, little
miss? Are you customers?

197
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,066
Oh, that's nifty.

198
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,601
Not every day that
youngsters come here

199
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:16,270
with a letter of introduction
from Granny Kokoro.

200
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,639
Uh... Hold on,
how old are you?

201
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,407
I'm 23, why do you ask?

202
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,576
You know, for someone who's
hardly any older than us,

203
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,378
you sure do talk
like an old man.

204
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,081
Hahahaha!
I get that a lot.

205
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,515
So, do you know Iceberg,

206
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,084
or did we come
to the wrong place?

207
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,585
Well, of course I know Iceberg.

208
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,454
Why, I'd say that
everyone here knows him,

209
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,789
seeing as he's the
mayor of the city and all.

210
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:40,060
Wow. Ice Pops is an
important guy, huh?

211
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,462
[KAKU]
Darn skippy he is.

212
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,697
He's also the president
of our Galley-La Company

213
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,100
and manager of the
sea train on top of that.

214
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,701
I didn't know he
was such a big deal!

215
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,170
[KAKU] I had a feeling you
weren't from around here.

216
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,072
Iceberg is pretty
famous in these parts.

217
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,574
But do you know
where we can find him?

218
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,610
[KAKU] Hmmm, that's
the question, isn't it?

219
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,412
He keeps pretty busy, of course.

220
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,048
Hunting him down can
be a chore sometimes.

221
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,583
[NAMI]
But you work for him, right?

222
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,285
Can't you get in touch somehow?

223
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:05,386
I suppose I could,

224
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,421
but it seems like you're
in a hurry to get this done.

225
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,689
[NAMI]
Not exactly, but--

226
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:12,660
Hahahaha...
It's fine, I understand.

227
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:15,161
You're itching to have
your ship looked at, right?

228
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,531
Where did you anchor it?

229
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,566
Uh, it's over
by the rocky cape.

230
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,336
[KAKU] All-righty then. I'll
skedaddle over there real quick.

231
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,371
If I take a gander at
your ship beforehand,

232
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,807
you can start talking cost
with Iceberg right away.

233
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,642
As I said, he's very busy,

234
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,644
so I'm sure he'll
be grateful as well.

235
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:34,248
Wait, skedaddle like how?
On a Yagara or what?

236
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,382
[KAKU]
Hahahaha.

237
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,185
I thought we were
trying to save time!

238
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,787
If you folks can hang
tight for ten minutes,

239
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,356
I should be back in two
shakes of a lamb's tail.

240
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,491
Just ten minutes?

241
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:47,260
[KAKU] That's right.
Or your money back.

242
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:51,665
[LUFFY]
Whoa!

243
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,604
[USOPP]
He's fast!

244
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,606
[KAKU]
Alley-oop!

245
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,708
WHOA! He flew!

246
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,479
Wait, where's he going?

247
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,214
If he jumps off
the edge he'll...

248
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,515
[ALL THREE]
Fall!

249
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,151
No! Come back!

250
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,291
Hahaha!

251
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:21,262
So cool!

252
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,597
Yeah, but is he gonna be okay?

253
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,832
Don't worry.

254
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,067
He's always
soaring through town.

255
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,068
Huh?

256
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,039
[ICEBERG] They call
him the "Mountain Wind."

257
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,207
If you didn't know,

258
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,077
he's the Galley-La Company's
Dock 1 Carpentry Foreman.

259
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,113
Kaku.

260
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:47,588
[SANJI] I see. So this
is the city of water, huh?

261
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:49,056
Pretty impressive place.

262
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,191
Lives up to its name,
that's for sure.

263
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,393
I mean, look around!

264
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,561
Clean water,
clean streets, fresh food,

265
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:57,197
and most importantly,
plenty of cute girls.

266
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,766
This place has it all.

267
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,067
Take my word for it,

268
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,268
this is the
perfect place to take

269
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:04,371
that special someone
on a romantic stroll.

270
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:08,074
But why stop at one when
I have two lovely ladies?

271
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,514
This one is Nami and
this one here is Robin!

272
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,683
[SHOP LADY A] You're
scaring away the customers!

273
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:16,884
Stop making that creepy face

274
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,620
and tell me which water-water
cabbage you want already!

275
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:20,687
I'll take both of them.

276
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:22,723
Oh, and there was something
I wanted to ask you.

277
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,258
I'm looking for
some local specialties

278
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,793
that're in season right now.

279
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:26,994
So what've you got?

280
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:30,130
[SHOP LADY A] Water-water
apples and water-water pears!

281
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,433
I can tell you where to find
some fish too, if you'd like.

282
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:33,434
My hubby runs a stand

283
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,636
just like this one down
at the seafood market.

284
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:36,570
[SANJI]
And where's that?

285
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,639
First, go over there
to get back on land.

286
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:41,308
Take six rights and
then seventeen lefts.

287
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,110
You'll see it straight ahead.

288
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,778
Huh?

289
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:48,749
[SANJI]
Let's see uh this way?

290
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,651
This place sure is a
pain when you have to walk.

291
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,522
If I don't stop
running into dead ends

292
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,524
and start figuring out
where the hell I am.

293
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,427
This food's gonna go bad before
I make it back to the Merry.

294
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,263
Don't tell me
Zoro's brain fungus

295
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,564
is starting to
spread to me, too.

296
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:14,174
Oh!! Robin, boy am
I glad to see you!

297
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:17,211
It's me, Sanji! Yoo hoo!

298
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,613
Robin! Look!

299
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:22,182
Huh?

300
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,252
She disappeared.

301
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,554
Looks like another
dead-end to me.

302
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,124
The only way to go
is up, but there's--

303
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,263
Usopp?

304
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:39,032
Man, I don't know
what's up with this place.

305
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,735
I'm not going crazy, am I?

306
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,285
[KAKU] Well lookie here.
That must be the one.

307
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,356
[KAKU]
Pardon me.

308
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:13,133
[thinking]
Oh, it's just Usopp.

309
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,401
My goodness,

310
00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:16,036
I know they told me
their ship needed repairs,

311
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,438
but I didn't think it
would be in shambles!

312
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,511
We should start by
replacing this mast.

313
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:29,083
[ZORO thinking]
Wait. That's not right.

314
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,785
Hey, I see you!
Don't move! You hear me?!

315
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:35,122
Oh pardon. I didn't
intend to disturb your nap.

316
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,491
[USOPP] Jeez! That was
a big surprise!

317
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,527
[LUFFY] I've never seen
someone jump that far before!

318
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,229
[ICEBERG]
Mmwell, my craftsmen are

319
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:45,165
the best in the
business for a reason.

320
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,138
Who is this guy?

321
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,072
Don't ask me.

322
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,074
[ICEBERG] Extraordinary
ships are not born

323
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,476
from ordinary circumstances.

324
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:59,079
They require a nearly
superhuman level of skill.

325
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,080
By the way, Kalifa.

326
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,049
I've already finished
the background check.

327
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,184
The one in the middle
is Straw Hat Luffy.

328
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:08,756
His crew also includes Pirate
Hunter Zoro and Nico Robin.

329
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,325
Their combined bounty is two
hundred thirty-nine million.

330
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,694
They have four other members
without posted bounties.

331
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,497
And their crew was
formed in the East Blue.

332
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,531
Named after their captain,

333
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,200
they're known simply
as the Straw Hat Pirates.

334
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,635
[thinking] They've really
got our number.

335
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:25,105
I see. Welcome.
My name is Iceberg.

336
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,774
I'm the boss here.

337
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:29,209
And this is a mouse
I just picked up.

338
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:33,714
Its name is... let's
see... Tyrannosaurus.

339
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:35,716
I'll need some
rodent food and a cage.

340
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:37,785
[KALIFA] I've already
taken care of that, Sir.

341
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:39,687
Mmwell! Amazing work, Kalifa!

342
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,656
Just doing my job.
Speaking of which.

343
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,725
You're due at a hotel
in Chiza for lunch

344
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,560
with a glassware
factory executive.

345
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:48,295
After that, you're
set to make a speech

346
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,531
at Liguria Square and
once that's finished.

347
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:53,601
You'll be meeting with
Mr. Bimine, the mayor of Pucci.

348
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:54,468
Their local newspaper

349
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:56,804
is scheduled to
interview you as well.

350
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,472
Oh, and when you
return to the office,

351
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,241
there's a folder full
of important documents

352
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:02,409
I need your signature on.

353
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,144
I don't wanna.

354
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:07,281
Very well, then I'll cancel
everything for you.

355
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,383
Hold on, you're
not serious are you?!

356
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,451
[ICEBERG]
What's the point in having power

357
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,519
if I don't get
to do what I want?

358
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:13,553
If that's how you run things,

359
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,522
you've gotta be the
worst mayor in the world!

360
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,358
Yeah Pops, that's pretty lazy.

361
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:19,260
So hold on, are you
sure this is the guy

362
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:20,694
that old lady
was talking about?

363
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,097
Uh-huh. He's the
guy, all right.

364
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,198
[KALIFA]
How dare you!

365
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,173
What's the big idea, lady?!

366
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,641
[NAMI]
That was scary!

367
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,716
I won't stand here and
let you insolent louts

368
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,653
disrespect one of the
world's leading ship engineers.

369
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:46,820
Hey, what's
going on over there?

370
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,455
Iceberg's
secretary just flipped out

371
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:49,723
on some pirates, again!

372
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,525
I wish she'd flip out on me!

373
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:52,492
Pardon me.

374
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,495
I get a bit carried
away from time to time.

375
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,298
Still, Iceberg is a respected
figure here in Water 7,

376
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:59,366
so try to show some courtesy.

377
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,635
Yes. Please don't
provoke Kalifa.

378
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,770
When she lashes out in anger...

379
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:06,273
...her aim sucks.

380
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:09,276
We might've hurt his feelings,
but you hurt his face!

381
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,778
You're way meaner than us!

382
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:13,213
Putting all that behind us,
if you're Iceberg,

383
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,447
you're the man
we're looking for.

384
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,585
Here, we brought a letter of
introduction for you to look at.

385
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:20,220
From Granny Kokoro?

386
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,789
Take a look at
their ship it says.

387
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,491
Aaaah!!

388
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,160
What?! Are you serious?!

389
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:28,429
There has to be something
we can do to change your mind!

390
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:30,397
If money's the
issue, we can pay!

391
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,431
If you're really the best,

392
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,434
then you've gotta be
the one to fix our Merry!

393
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:34,668
C'mon, we're begging!

394
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:35,669
[ICEBERG]
Okay.

395
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,471
That's it?! You don't
need to think about it?

396
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:38,305
[ICEBERG]
Nope.

397
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,640
Then why'd you
tear up the letter?!

398
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,442
The lipstick mark
was creeping me out.

399
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:42,776
Even so, Granny Kokoro and I

400
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,545
have been drinking
buddies for years.

401
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,647
Mmwell and since
Kaku has already gone

402
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,714
to make an assessment for me,

403
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,550
it would seem like a
waste to turn you down now.

404
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,486
Wouldn't you say?

405
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,688
Besides, it's not like
I had anything better to do.

406
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,590
Let me show you around
the factory, sound good?

407
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,359
[LUFFY]
Sweet! Bring it on!

408
00:20:58,392 --> 00:20:59,426
Come along with me then.

409
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,628
Did he seriously
cancel all of his

410
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:02,496
meetings just
to give us a tour?

411
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:06,166
Yeah! You gotta let me sit
on all the cool ships, okay?

412
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,435
[USOPP]
Oh, right... the money.

413
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:12,706
Wait, what? No!
No, no, no, no, no!

414
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:15,743
NOOOOO!

415
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:19,012
Hey! What's wrong
Usopp? Come on!

416
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:22,449
The-The-The money...
It... it disappeared!

417
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,118
Aaaaahhh!

418
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:25,286
[NAMI]
Did you drop it somewhere?!

419
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,487
[USOPP]
I don't know!

420
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:39,767
Hey! Over there!

[USOPP]
Wait! Who are you?!

422
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:44,805
Why are you taking our money--
I mean, give it back!

423
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:48,809
We need it, you jerks!
Do you hear me?! Hey!

424
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:50,544
[chuckles]

425
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:52,346
Thanks for the cash!

426
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:56,349
[USOPP]
Give us our money back!

Hey, Usopp!

429
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:16,297
Why did you give those
guys all our money?!

430
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,132
[USOPP]
I didn't! They stole it!

At any rate, about your ship.

432
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:20,467
[LUFFY]
Oh right. How is she?

433
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,303
[KAKU] She must've gone
on quite the journey.

434
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:23,704
[USOPP] That's why we
need you to fix her!

I have some bad news.
