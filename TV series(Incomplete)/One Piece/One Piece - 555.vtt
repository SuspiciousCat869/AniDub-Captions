00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.705
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:08.742
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.511
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.747
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.082
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.985
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.254
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.223
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:27.427
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:38.925
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.861
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:47.033
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:49.569
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:52.906
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.741
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:57.177
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.879
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:04.517
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.152
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:09.822
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:14.027
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.899
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:22.669
Luffy and his crew
arrive on Fishman Island,

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:26.739
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:29.075
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:34.047
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.217
[NARRATOR] It's not long
before the Straw Hats

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.986
get pulled into the conflict.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.854
[RANDOM FISHMAN 554A] About time
you showed up, Straw Hat!

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.524
[RANDOM FISHMAN 554B]
I can't believe he came!

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:45.792
Wait, Luffy.

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.961
What did you call me?

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:48.828
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:49.796
Just now.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.332
It was almost my name, but--

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.934
Yeah. I was wrong about you.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:57.470
You're a wuss,
but more than just a crybaby.

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:58.605
[gasps]

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:02.041
[LUFFY] So I'll call you
"Weepyhoshi." It's an upgrade.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.111
[chuckles] Oh, yes.

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:09.148
You pirates will bow
the same as everyone else.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.017
Just you wait.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.218
You see?

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.187
These humans are more than
capable of holding their own,

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.489
yet they kneel before me.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.625
That's right.

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:22.328
In a moment, you'll be
just like them, Straw Hats!

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:24.964
I'll be King of the Fishmen,
King of the Humans,

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:27.934
and King of the Pirates!

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:29.636
Is that so?

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.171
[HORDY]
We have a hundred thousand men!

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:34.774
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES cheer]

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:36.042
[ZORO, SANJI gasp]

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.379
[SANJI]
Hey, Luffy!

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.949
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE MM] Those
four million berries are mine!

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:44.217
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE NN]
No, they're mine!

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.152
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE OO]
It's too easy!

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:49.856
[HORDY laughs]
Kill him!

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:01.668
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE PP yells]
What the hell just happened?!

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:07.940
But he didn't do anything!

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.709
And he still
knocked them all out!

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:11.678
[LUFFY]
Your name's Hordy, right?

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.280
I'm about to kick your ass.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.749
You wanna become the king
of a country or whatever?

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:18.685
Fine, I don't care.

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:22.221
But King of the Pirates?

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:23.222
Nuh-uh.

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:25.024
That's my job.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.329
[LUFFY] "Deadly Attacks
One After Another!

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:32.031
Zoro and Sanji Join the Battle!"

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.140
All that in one shot!

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:16.609
I've never seen power like that!

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:19.045
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE B]
So that's him.

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:21.180
That's Straw Hat Luffy!

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:32.191
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE C]
He's gonna mop the floor

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.393
with us for sure!

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:35.061
[ZEO]
Where do you think you're going?

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:36.095
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE C gasps]

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.397
[ZEO] If you won't
stand with your people

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.167
on the day of our uprising,
I might as well kill you myself.

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:45.438
[ZEO]
It's true.

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:50.410
We may have lost 50,000,
but take heart.

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:53.513
We still have 50,000 left!

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.582
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:58.718
[ZEO] Those insufferable
Straw Hat Pirates

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:01.721
have sought to shatter
our dreams at every turn.

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.756
They must pay!

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.000
[ZEO]
The traitor Jimbei is no better!

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:16.202
He follows in
Otohime's footsteps

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:18.137
and befriends the humans!

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:22.141
But that is not the future
we Fishmen wish to create!

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:24.477
He's right! Straw Hat's
a damn human!

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.646
What the hell does he
know about our people?

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:27.880
And Jimbei.

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:31.484
If he wants to turn his back on
his brothers, kill him, too!

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:37.490
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:42.795
[ZORO]
Jeez.

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:44.464
You knocked out too many.

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:45.998
Leave some for me.

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:48.234
Oh, yeah. My bad.

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:50.303
Hey, don't get
ahead of yourself.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:50.970
Huh?

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:52.772
I'm taking 30,000.

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:54.474
Got it, moss-head?

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:56.609
Shut up, dirty cook.

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:57.977
Ugh.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.312
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE F groans]

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.950
Ooh, it looks like we've
got a full house tonight!

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.919
Okay. Thankfully,
I've got just the jam

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:08.821
to start this battle off right!

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:11.190
Oh, yeah!

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:16.162
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:17.597
I'm not sure, Brook.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.799
I don't think they
came here to see you.

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:22.935
[BROOK laughs]
Robin's cool as always.

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.470
Or just cold.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:27.206
No way. They didn't even
listen to your speech!

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.610
[ZEO] Because I used
my inside voice again!

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:31.744
Huh?

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:34.747
He's got way too much
pride to admit it!

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:37.783
[HORDY]
Kill them!

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:40.386
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.255
You're dead now!

00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:44.090
Don't mess with us!

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:56.035
Okay! Go, Third Gear!

00:08:58.571 --> 00:08:59.939
Just come at me!

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:02.108
I'll take all of you!

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:05.478
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:06.846
His arm is--

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.748
I know! It's huge!

00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:12.852
Here goes! Giant Pistol!

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.560
Quick! We had better assist him!

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:23.329
Damn, Luffy. Wait for us.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.332
[SANJI]
I have to help.

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:29.201
I can't bear to see
tears in those eyes.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:33.439
[JIMBEI] Singlehandedly,
you were a defender.

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:37.276
Protecting the virtues
of others, day after day.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.312
But today, we're here.

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:41.514
We'll protect them for you.

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:51.691
If I can't wipe the tears
from a pretty girl's eyes,

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:53.059
I'm no man at all!

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:56.262
Let me go and teach
'em a thing or two.

00:09:56.295 --> 00:09:59.599
After this, we can celebrate
over drinks at the Mermaid CafÃ©.

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:00.833
What do ya say?

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:03.235
Stop yapping and fight!

00:10:06.138 --> 00:10:11.978
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES groaning]

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:13.512
[SANJI]
Collier Shoot!

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yell]

00:10:16.582 --> 00:10:18.351
This is heaven for me.

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:20.753
I won't let you destroy it!

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.355
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:24.090
You still don't wanna give up?

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:26.492
Well, more fun for me.

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:30.096
[ZORO]
One hundred and eight...

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:31.864
...Caliber Phoenix!

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES screaming]

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:50.316
What are you lookin'
at? Let's fight!

00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:51.484
I was thinking.

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:52.785
This island is teeming with

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:55.788
invaluable
archaeological resources.

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:58.958
The way you're rampaging
around and damaging it--

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:01.293
You ought to be ashamed!

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.828
The people.

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:04.096
The kingdom.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.965
They're all treasures.

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:09.268
Trienta Fleurs.

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES gasp]

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:10.870
What's happening?

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:11.904
And Clutch!

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES groan]

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:47.306
You've all been a lovely
audience today. [laughs]

00:11:51.677 --> 00:11:53.446
Gotcha now, little guy!

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:55.314
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES chuckling]

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:56.649

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:00.352
Hwa!

Whoa! He got bigger!

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:06.325
Heh. I'll take you
all on. Bring it!

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:07.893
Hwa! Hwa! Hwa, hwa!

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:09.962
Dude! What kinda
raccoon are you?

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:12.665
Oh, that is the last straw!

[USOPP]
Special Attack, Green Star.

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.269
Devil!

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:21.540
Huh? Aah! Help me!

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:25.411
Take this! And this!
And this, too!

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.114
Had enough?

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:30.483
They call me the
Pop Green Master.

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:32.518
I'm the all-powerful Usopp'n!

[USOPP]
Huh?

00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:44.730
Hey, nice timing, Nami!

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.365
And here I thought
you'd gotten stronger

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:47.700
over those two years.

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:49.401
Guess I was wrong. [gasps]

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.971
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yell]

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:56.809
This fight's starting to get
super exciting now, huh?

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.744
I'd say a 50,000 man brawl

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:02.148
is the perfect time to
take them for a test drive.

00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:03.048
Test drive?

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:05.251
Did you say "them"? Them who?

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:07.920
The Sunny just got
two brand-new weapons.

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:09.088
Big ones!

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:11.090
You guys wanna see 'em?

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:13.692
[BOTH]
Yeah! Of course we do!

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:15.895
[FRANKY]
Wow! Super!

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:17.830
[USOPP]
So what are they? Show us!

00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:19.064
[CHOPPER]
I gotta know!

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:21.400
You think we'll be safer
on the ship than out here?

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:24.770
See for yourself! However
badass you think it's gonna be,

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:27.039
it's ten times better than that!

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.011
You're all... so strong!

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:33.412
I don't believe this!

00:13:33.445 --> 00:13:36.182
You sorry wimps didn't
even put up a fight!

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:38.150
[HORDY]
Tch.

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:40.920
You should keep an eye
on your princess.

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:45.090
[HORDY chuckles]
That's a pretty big target!

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:47.293
She's mine now!

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.727
Water Shot!

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:50.796
[LUFFY gasps]

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.031
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]

00:13:57.803 --> 00:14:00.539
[SHIRAHOSHI screams]

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:06.979
[LUFFY gasps]
They didn't need me after all.

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:08.314
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Huh?

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:16.355
[ZEO]
What happened?

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:42.114
[DARUMA screams]
Did you see that crap?

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:44.917
He deflected Captain Hordy's
Water Shot with his own!

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.719
Like it was nothing at all!

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:49.221
I am so done with that
big, blue traitor!

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:52.558
He's as much trouble as
Straw Hat! Maybe more!

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:56.662
Ha. That raw power of yours
is harnessed very poorly.

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:59.732
Your Fishman Karate needs work.

00:14:59.765 --> 00:15:02.501
Wait a minute. I've heard
stories about this guy.

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:05.371
He was the first Fishman
to join the Seven Warlords!

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:07.139
Yeah, and then
after he resigned,

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:10.376
his bounty jumped up to four
hundred million berries, right?

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:11.744
This is hopeless!

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:13.579
We can't win against that guy!

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:16.515
Why don't you fools stop
chattering and start fighting!

00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:18.717
If you intend to
kill the princess,

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:22.388
you'll have to square
with the rest of us first.

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:24.657
Well, what are you waiting for?

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.260
There is nothing left for you
lot but to go forth and fight!

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.062
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yell]

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:31.997
[grunts, gasps]

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.933
You've gotta be kidding!

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:37.303
[ZORO]
This is boring.

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:41.540
[ZEO]
Such impertinence.

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:47.079
[ZEO] I would advise you to hold
your tongue for the time being.

00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:56.188
[ZEO] At least until you've
broken through our defenses!

00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:57.056
[ZORO]
Heh.

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:58.691
Hope you're not
attached to that sword.

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:01.860
I'll smash it to bits! [yells]

00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:04.496
[ZEO]
Go forth. Iron Shell Squad!

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.066
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yell]

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:08.467
[ZORO]
Hmph.

00:16:11.203 --> 00:16:13.339
[ZORO]
Please!

00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:16.775
Will you train me
as a swordsman?

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:27.252
[ZORO panting]

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:36.228
Copying Hawk-eye.

00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:38.597
Right down to that
oversized sword.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.899
[HUMANDRILLS shriek]

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:42.434
They're nothing but weaklings!

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:44.636
I'm wasting my
damn time with this!

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.374
[ZORO grunting]

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:49.341
[ZORO]
Damn it.

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.643
How many times is this
gonna happen to me?

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:54.246
I said I was gonna
get stronger, didn't I?

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:06.692
[ZORO] I swear, I'm never
going to lose again!

00:17:06.725 --> 00:17:08.827
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.763
Three-Sword Style.

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:22.741
[ZORO]
Black Rope Tatsumaki!

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES screaming]

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:30.983
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE AB gasps]

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:32.284
He cut through their shells!

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:34.653
It's like they were
made outta cheese!

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:35.654
What the hell?

00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:37.389
They all dropped like flies!

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.625
Is this guy the
grim reaper or what?

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:40.993
It's not over.

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:42.294

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES screaming]

00:17:44.163 --> 00:17:45.497
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE EE]
This is sick!

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:47.466
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE FF]
It's a sword hurricane!

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:49.168
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE GG]
Run, you're gonna get cut!

00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:51.937
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE HH] How long
is this thing gonna last?!

00:17:53.005 --> 00:17:54.540
Until you get to hell.

00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:59.645

idiots use your brains?

Attack from the sky!

[gasps]

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.592
So it's like that?

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:14.526
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE AI]
Move it.

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE II screams]

00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:18.230
Watch out. We'll stab you!

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:20.933
Go, Harisenbon!

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:23.969
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE JJ screams]
It's the Sea Urchin Spike Unit.

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:26.171
And their leader Harisenbon!

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:31.810
Before you do anything else,
take out the kicking guy!

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:35.414
Hari-sen-bon!

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:38.750
Well? What are you
gonna do now, huh?

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:41.553
Sanji! Do be careful!

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:44.289
How can you be so calm
at a time like this?

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:45.724
Hey!

00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:55.334

It's been a while since then.

Sanji!

00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:02.875
[SANJI]
I ran like hell.

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:04.910
[CAROLINE]
Come back, candy boy!

00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:07.412
[SANJI]
Over my dead body!

00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:10.482
[CAROLINE] I brought my
favorite dress just for you!

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:12.518
Why don't you try it on?

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:14.686
[RANDOM QUEEN A]
Don't be shy, it's just us!

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.389
[SANJI] That's not
the problem! Forget it!

00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:19.458
[SANJI screaming]

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:22.928
[SANJI]
Through the rain, and the snow.

00:19:25.097 --> 00:19:27.366
[SANJI]
Through thunder and lightning.

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:29.568
I never stopped.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.574
[HARISENBON] Say your prayers,
you stubborn bastard!

00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:37.276
Aren't you adorable!

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:39.578
You can't just run away
from us forever, you know.

00:19:39.611 --> 00:19:42.447
One of these days we're certain
to catch right up to you!

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:44.716
[QUEENS]
Oh, Sanji!

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:45.951
[SANJI]
I've gotten myself out of

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:48.587
tougher spots than
this, haven't I?

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.723
[QUEENS]
Sanji!

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:55.394
Damn you!

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:58.163
Can't win! Don't fight!

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:04.436
[SANJI]
Did I already forget everything

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:06.772
that happened back at Sabaody?

00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:10.909
[QUEENS]
Sanji!

00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:13.979
I need those recipes
if I want to get stronger.

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:16.315
And taking them down
is the only way.

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:17.950
Bring it on!

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:20.052
[QUEENS]
Candy boy!

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:23.188
There's no escape, Sanji!

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:27.559
[QUEENS]
You're all mine!

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:29.695
[laughs] Goodness gracious.

00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:32.197
Now you're all
surrounded, aren't you?

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:33.865
[SANJI gasps]

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:36.301
[QUEENS]
Sanji!

00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:38.604
Sanji darling!

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:42.374
Sweetheart sugar-bear!

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:49.114
[SANJI] My courage had left me,
and there was nowhere to run.

00:20:52.284 --> 00:20:59.157
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES groaning]

00:21:05.297 --> 00:21:06.365
[SANJI]
Then--

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:09.101
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES groaning]

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:12.004
What the? He's gone! Huh?

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.745
[SANJI]
I found a new path.

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:23.548
[QUEENS]
Sanji, wait!

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:28.120
[SANJI]
And then, before long...

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.091
[SANJI]
...I was flying!

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:37.262
He can fly?

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.464
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Huh?

00:21:39.498 --> 00:21:40.866
[SANJI]
Ha, ha!

00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:42.434
Sky Walk!

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:44.469
Awesome!

00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:48.407
Sanji can walk on air now!
Like those other guys!

00:21:55.213 --> 00:21:57.549
"Sky Walk." Oh, I see.

00:21:57.582 --> 00:21:59.251
Not "Moon Walk"?

00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:01.620
[SANJI]
Hey, scumbags!

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:02.354
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Huh?

00:22:02.387 --> 00:22:03.188
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE KK]
Whoa!

00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:04.423
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE LL]
He's flying!

00:22:04.456 --> 00:22:06.325
[SANJI] If you've got something
to say to the princess,

00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:09.127
you'll have to go
through me first!

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:13.131
'Cause I just happen to be
her knight in shining armor!

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:14.866
Thank you, Sanji!

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.968
Are you some kinda wise guy?

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:19.071
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Boo!

00:22:19.104 --> 00:22:21.673
Let's cook these small fries!

00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:24.643
Diable Jambe!

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:29.348
Poele a Frire-Spectre!

00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:36.054
[grunting]

00:22:46.665 --> 00:22:48.033
Hey, Hordy.

00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:49.201
[HORDY]
Hm?

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.804
It's almost over.

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:54.873
So you can just sit tight.

00:22:57.709 --> 00:23:01.113
You can send a hundred thousand,
or ten million guys after us.

00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:04.950
But every single one of them
is going down, you hear me?

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:17.496
[NARRATOR] Brook and Robin
tear through the battlefield

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:18.730
with their new skills,

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:21.433
forcing the New Fishman
Pirates to counterattack

00:23:21.466 --> 00:23:23.402
with their Deadly Venom Squad.

00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:24.603
Not to be outdone,

00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:27.873
Franky shows off a new weapon
of monumental proportions.

00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:29.341
His crewmates are dazzled,
