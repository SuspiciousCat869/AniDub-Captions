1
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:43,658
[GOLD ROGER] The world.
What a glorious place!

2
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:49,039
Seek freedom and it will lie
stretched out before your eyes.

3
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:53,543
If the endless dream guides
your restless spirit, seize it!

4
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:57,213
Raise your flag, and stand tall!

5
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,052
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)</i>

6
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:05,221
<i>I think back to the time</i>
<i>when my search first began--</i>

7
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:07,599
<i>I left behind those</i>
<i>shores of sand--</i>

8
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:12,145
<i>For the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

9
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:15,106
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

10
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,400
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

11
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:25,700
<i>See the light I have searched</i>
<i>for everywhere (ere-ere!)</i>

12
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:28,203
<i>When the summer sun is shining,</i>

13
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:30,830
<i>shaking the sails</i>
<i>of my heart, I know...</i>

14
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:35,835
<i>(Fly away glum blue sea)</i>

15
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:38,254
<i>A brand-new world</i>
<i>that had been hiding</i>

16
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:40,882
<i>has opened up its</i>
<i>doors for me to go...</i>

17
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:45,261
<i>(Fly away glum blue sky)</i>

18
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:47,806
<i>Swaying in the troubled waves--</i>

19
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,266
<i>From all despair,</i>
<i>I can be saved--</i>

20
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,561
<i>For the horizon</i>
<i>on the other side is--</i>

21
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,814
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</i>

22
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:57,899
<i>Is what I aim for!</i>

23
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:00,944
<i>And though I've traveled far</i>
<i>from where my search began--</i>

24
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:03,446
<i>Over seas of green</i>
<i>and shores of sand--</i>

25
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,159
<i>Through the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

26
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:10,954
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

27
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:13,248
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

28
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:18,336
<i>See the light I have</i>
<i>searched for everywhere!</i>

29
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:27,887
[ZABO]
No!

30
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:48,074
[GEDATZ] Yet another
group of illegal entrants

31
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:51,745
have already
infiltrated Skypeia.

32
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:53,371
Old lady Amazon informed us

33
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:57,417
that it's a ship with seven
Blue Sea dwellers on board.

34
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,753
[NAMI]
Seven Blue Sea dwellers?

35
00:02:59,836 --> 00:03:01,421
That's probably us!

36
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,089
[gasps]

37
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:06,593
[MCKINLEY]
White Berets, halt!

38
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:09,220
[WHITE BERETS]
Heso!

39
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:10,096
[CONIS]
Heso.

40
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,473
[PAGAYA]
Heso, gentlemen.

41
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:12,682
[SUU]
Suu-suu.

42
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:15,226
Speak our language!
We can't understand you.

43
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,187
Well, look what we have here.

44
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,938
You must be the
Blue Sea dwellers

45
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:22,275
who have illegally entered the
sovereign land of Skypiea!

46
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:23,485
Prepare to have the weight

47
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:26,613
of Heaven's Judgment
brought down upon you!

48
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:28,239
You're calling them criminals?

49
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:29,491
[LUFFY]
Hm?

50
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:36,706
[LUFFY] "Already Criminals?!
Skypiea's Upholder of the Law!"

51
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:41,711
Illegal entry? What's that?

52
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:44,464
Let's just say it's not good.

53
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:46,675
[MCKINLEY] Don't waste your
breath making excuses.

54
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:49,177
Amazon, the woman who
stands at Heaven's Gate,

55
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,222
captured these very images
using her vision dial.

56
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:54,516
No, wait. That can't be!

57
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,559
I think this is all
a big misunderstanding,

58
00:03:56,643 --> 00:03:58,061
Captain McKinley.

59
00:03:58,144 --> 00:04:00,897
They're not the criminals
you're making them out to be.

60
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,066
What do you mean
by illegal entry?

61
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:05,151
Does this have to do
with that ridiculous

62
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:06,986
one billion extol entrance fee?

63
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,530
Because we didn't
pay her a thing.

64
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:10,824
But didn't that old lady say
we didn't have to pay it?

65
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:12,659
It's not like she
tried to stop us.

66
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:13,827
Yeah, that's true!

67
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,621
Enough! There's no sense
trying to deny it.

68
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:18,373
Now, fess up!

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,752
Don't worry, you need not
become panicked just yet.

70
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:24,129
According to Heaven's Judgment,

71
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:27,007
Illegal Entry is only
an 11th degree crime!

72
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,675
Once you accept
your punishment--

73
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:29,759
which will be minimal--

74
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:31,803
you become legal
tourists on the spot

75
00:04:31,886 --> 00:04:33,430
and may go about your business.

76
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:35,432
Well, you shoulda
told us that sooner,

77
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:36,891
but before we accept,

78
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:39,102
what exactly do you have
planned as far as punishment?

79
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:40,562
A mere slap on the wrist.

80
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:43,606
All you need to do is pay
ten times the entrance fee.

81
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,400
Of course, if you
pay immediately,

82
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:47,819
we'll pretend this little
episode never happened.

83
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:51,156
So, ten billion per person,
times seven people

84
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,908
makes your total
70 billion extols.

85
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:54,826
Cash only.

86
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:57,537
Wait, 70 billion extols?

87
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,539
That sounds like an
awful lotta money!

88
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:01,041
How much is that in Berries?

89
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:03,626
That's the currency used
in the Blue Sea World, right?

90
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,130
Today's exchange rates are
10,000 extols per Berry.

91
00:05:07,213 --> 00:05:09,174
Let's see now,
there's, uh, 10,000,

92
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:10,759
and you gotta carry
the one, and, uh,

93
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:12,302
is there a decimal in there?

94
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:13,762
Five?

95
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:16,806
Seventy billion extols is seven
million Berries, genius.

96
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,976
Get real! Do you realize
how expensive that is?!

97
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,062
After risking our lives
coming to this place,

98
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:23,688
why should we have
to pay a stupid fee

99
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,648
just to enter your
precious city?

100
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:26,983
We can't agree to that!

101
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,735
[MCKINLEY]
You brought this on yourselves.

102
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:32,197
If you had just paid the 700,000
Berries in the first place,

103
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,907
we wouldn't be having this talk.

104
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,160
[SANJI]
That's still way too expensive!

105
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:38,787
This is your first warning.

106
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,707
The White Berets serve under
the vassals of almighty Eneru.

107
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,377
Arguing with us will only raise
the level of your crime.

108
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,796
[SANJI]
Oh, whatever, man.

109
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,255
Let's forget these idiots.

110
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:51,383
We need to start looking for
Nami. I'm getting worried.

111
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:54,010
She may need my tender
affections right about now.

112
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:54,969
[CHOPPER]
Is she in trouble?

113
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:56,346
[LUFFY]
I doubt it.

114
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:04,396
[NAMI] Those weird guys
from earlier somehow knew

115
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,439
about us coming to Skypiea.

116
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:09,109
That means Luffy and the
others may be in trouble.

117
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:10,819
Better hurry back!

118
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:16,282
Soon as the wind
changes direction,

119
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,326
we can head out for
another adventure.

120
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,786
I mean, to look for Nami.

121
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:20,662
[USOPP yelps]

122
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:21,746
Listen to me!

123
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,124
Usopp, are you doin' okay?

124
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:26,084
[USOPP]
Wait, keep your cool, Usopp.

125
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,669
Try and talk some
sense into him.

126
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:29,212
You know, Cap'n.

127
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:31,506
If Nami's just taking a joy
ride around the island,

128
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:32,716
she may be back any minute.

129
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,050
If we leave now,
we could miss her.

130
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:35,969
We don't want that, now do we?

131
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:36,970
You think so?

132
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:39,431
She's taking way
too long for that!

133
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:40,598
Shut up!

134
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:42,017
The reason Luffy's here
in the first place

135
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,269
is to prove he can go where
he was told he can't go,

136
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:45,687
not chase after Nami, stupid!

137
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,771
[CHOPPER]
Okay!

138
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:47,647
That's true.

139
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:49,024
Let's just go.

140
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,693
Yeah, guys, Conis warned us
about that, remember?

141
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:53,653
If we go, we'll incur
Eneru's wrath,

142
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:55,363
then who knows how
much trouble we'll be in?

143
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:56,781
So what now?

144
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,825
Our best bet is to
wait here for Nami,

145
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:01,411
and try not to upset
the White Berets.

146
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:02,996
I mean, it's Nami
we're talkin' about!

147
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,330
She's gotta have
a secret stash

148
00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:06,291
of a few trillion
Berries somewhere!

149
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:09,127
She can pay up, and
then we're outta here!

150
00:07:10,628 --> 00:07:13,882
All right, what are you all
blabbing about over there?

151
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:15,592
And where's your
seventh crewmate?

152
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:17,135
I only count six!

153
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:19,888
Do I need to add "suspicion
of fleeing the island" to...

154
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:22,057
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let's not get carried away here!

155
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,351
She's just takin' the waver
out for a quick spin.

156
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:26,978
Soon as she gets back she can
pay the fine in its entirety.

157
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:29,105
You can trust us, sir.
We're good for it!

158
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:30,357
Heh.

159
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:33,193
[USOPP] Okay, I think
I bought us some time.

160
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:35,737
Now, Luffy, don't do anything
stupid to make Nami angry.

161
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,447
You know how she can get.

162
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,282
[LUFFY]
Aww. Okay.

163
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,325
[USOPP]
Sanji, you, too.

164
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:42,369
[SANJI]
Yeah, yeah.

165
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:44,954
Great! That's the plan.
We'll meet back here later!

166
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:47,499
[SANJI] So, Robin, can I treat
you to a cup of tea?

167
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:49,376
[ROBIN]
Sure.

168
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:53,046
[sighs] Boy, that
was a close one.

169
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,047
Hey, Chopper!

170
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,256
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

171
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,299
[USOPP] You wanna go
fishin' or somethin'?

172
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:58,009
[CHOPPER]
Totally! Let's do it!

173
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:00,053
[USOPP] Conis, are there
any good fishin' spots

174
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:01,638
you know of around here?

175
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:04,265
[CONIS] I know of one about five
minutes from here. Follow me.

176
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:06,393
[LUFFY]
I can't wait to ride this thing!

177
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:08,603
I hope you can fix it.

178
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:11,606
[MCKINLEY] This waver
looks downright abused!

179
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,275
If I find out you're responsible
for this damage,

180
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,736
you're looking at a
tenth degree crime:

181
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,738
"Destruction of Sky
Island Property

182
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:20,073
by a Blue Sea Dweller."

183
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,325
I'm sorry, Captain McKinley,
this is my fault.

184
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:24,369
I crashed the waver, not him.

185
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:26,204
[LUFFY] Yeah, besides,
this thing's mine.

186
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:29,082
[MCKINLEY] Is that right?
Sounds suspicious to me.

187
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:31,459
I was under the impression
wavers didn't exist

188
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:32,544
in the Blue Sea World.

189
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:34,671
If this one was stolen
from Skypiea,

190
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,464
the degree of your
crime will increase!

191
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:39,509
It's not stolen!
Wanna fight about it?

192
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:41,428
[MCKINLEY]
Excuse me?

193
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:42,887
[USOPP screams]

194
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:44,556
Don't mind him!
He was just kidding!

195
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,433
Right this way, Luffy!

196
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:48,727
[MCKINLEY] Who do these Blue
Sea dwellers think they are,

197
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,396
insulting a senior member
of the White Berets?

198
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,398
They'll pay for this.

199
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:55,817
This's the life.

200
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,404
Gorgeous girl and
a view. Not bad.

201
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,409
I'm losing it!

202
00:09:04,492 --> 00:09:05,744
Don't let it get away!

203
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:08,038
Hands are slipping!

204
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:09,205
Luffy, help!

205
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:11,207
[LUFFY]
Hm? Ah!

206
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:20,133
[USOPP]
We got 'im!

207
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:23,053
[CHOPPER]
It's a big one!

208
00:09:23,136 --> 00:09:24,971
[ALL scream]

209
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:26,598
[gasping]

210
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:29,142
[CONIS screams]

211
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:45,450
What did we catch?
A fish or a monster?

212
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,285
[CHOPPER]
It tried to eat Conis.

213
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:48,828
[ZORO]
Take it this is a sky fish.

214
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:49,954
[PAGAYA]
You're heroes!

215
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:51,206
[ALL]
Hm?

216
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,333
Mere words cannot express
how grateful I am

217
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,001
that you saved my daughter.

218
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:57,295
[CONIS]
Father, look.

219
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,130
[PAGAYA]
We're in trouble.

220
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:02,258
[MCKINLEY]
Why am I not surprised?

221
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:04,260
This species of sky
fish is so rare

222
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:05,720
that it's forbidden to catch it.

223
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:08,098
Your incompetence has
once again earned you

224
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:09,599
a violation of the law.

225
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:11,893
This time it's a
ninth degree crime.

226
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:13,311
[CHOPPER]
Why is that a crime?!

227
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:15,939
That thing was gonna eat
Conis! Zoro saved her life!

228
00:10:16,022 --> 00:10:17,649
[chuckles]

229
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:19,651
Wait! Zoro, you didn't
kill it, did you?

230
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:21,069
Don't think so.

231
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:24,406
Well, if it's not dead,
then we didn't commit a crime!

232
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:26,574
[roars]

233
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:29,202
[USOPP] See? What'd I
tell ya? It's alive!

234
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:32,122
Yum!

235
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:34,374
Don't eat it, Luffy! Stop!

236
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,211
You just dug your
own grave, son.

237
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:41,798
Eating an endangered species
is an eighth degree crime.

238
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:44,050
[LUFFY] Little on the tough
side, and it tastes kinda fishy!

239
00:10:44,134 --> 00:10:45,093
[USOPP]
Get off of him, Luffy!

240
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,845
Hey, sky fish,
go back to your home.

241
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:49,889
And if you see any bait
on a hook, don't bite it!

242
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:00,275
You know, I've been biting
my tongue for the last day

243
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:03,403
listening to all the bogus
crimes you're accusing us of.

244
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:05,321
If you don't cut it out, I'll--

245
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:07,699
[USOPP] Zoro! Wait!
Think about what you're saying!

246
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:09,659
[MCKINLEY]
This has become ridiculous.

247
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:12,704
Your behavior is obviously
an attempt at extortion.

248
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:14,956
Congratulations,
seventh degree crime.

249
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,666
[USOPP] Zoro wasn't
trying to extort you!

250
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,835
Uh, he was about to say,
"If you don't cut it out,

251
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:20,837
I will have a good laugh!"

252
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,798
It's kinda like his
catchphrase. Asilly gag!

253
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:25,133
This isn't fair!

254
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:27,427
He's trying to get us
in trouble on purpose!

255
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,679
Ah! Chopper!

256
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:31,639
Shut up. You're only gonna
make things worse!

257
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:34,434
The only way to not get
in trouble is do nothing!

258
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:37,187
Do nothing, huh? That's it!

259
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,355
Now we just have to hope

260
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:40,023
that we don't get
charged for loitering.

261
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:41,399
Okay! Nap time!

262
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:46,488
[snoring]

263
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:57,040
[MCKINLEY] How dare they make
such a racket on Angel Beach.

264
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:01,461
Listen up, you're
all in violation

265
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:03,588
of Skypiea's noise
pollution statutes,

266
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:05,298
which are sixth degree crimes.

267
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:06,841
[USOPP]
You mean we can't even snore?

268
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,843
Agh! Enough already!

269
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:11,346
Let's put a beating on
this beret-wearing freak!

270
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:13,014
--[ZORO] Yes, let's.
--Stop it!

271
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:14,849
[USOPP]
Guys! Cool down!

272
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:20,230
[NAMI] Oh, no, there's
a whole group of people!

273
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:22,982
I hope they're not
those guys from before.

274
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,317
Whoever they are,

275
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:26,986
I hope Luffy's not pulling
any of his usual stunts.

276
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,947
Let's sit down and take
a breather, okay?

277
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,949
Zoro, Luffy, Chopper,
there's no reason for us--

278
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:32,951
[NAMI]
I'm back!

279
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:36,246
Nami, baby! I missed you!

280
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:40,166
[NAMI] Luffy! Promise you won't
start any trouble, okay?!

281
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,960
[LUFFY] Don't know if I
can keep that promise!

282
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:43,503
Hey! Nami!

283
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:45,880
We need you to fork up seven
million Berries from your stash

284
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:47,674
to pay for all the fines we got!

285
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:52,178
Oh, good! So we pay the
fine and we're clear?

286
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:55,348
Did he say seven million?

287
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,686
[MCKINLEY]
Hm? What?!

288
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:02,355
[NAMI]
You're ripping us off!!

289
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,946
[gasps] Oh, crap!

290
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,574
I was so worked up I forgot
to hit the brakes!

291
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:13,491
[BOTH]
Ouch.

292
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:15,368
[WHITE BERETS]
Captain!

293
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:16,953
[NAMI] Hey, thanks for letting
me use your waver.

294
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:18,621
I love the way it handles.

295
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:20,165
[PAGAYA]
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

296
00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:21,374
But more importantly,

297
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,418
do you realize how much
trouble you're in now?

298
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:24,586
[WHITE BERET A]
Captain...

299
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:26,087
[NAMI] Guys, let's make
ourselves scarce.

300
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:27,255
[LUFFY]
Aww. Aren't you gonna finish

301
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,506
the fight you just started?

302
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,425
[NAMI] Trust me, this
Eneru is not someone

303
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:31,801
we wanna mess with.

304
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:33,887
I assume that's another
crime on our records.

305
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,430
Oh, yes, quite.

306
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:38,058
And knocking out an official
is a crime of the fifth degree.

307
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:40,477
Fifth, huh? Could be worse.

308
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,354
[CONIS]
That's not good at all.

309
00:13:42,437 --> 00:13:45,398
Once you're found guilty of
committing a fifth degree crime,

310
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:47,025
almighty Eneru will banish you

311
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:48,985
to the land of the
drifting clouds.

312
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:50,403
How's that bad?

313
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:52,364
[LUFFY]
Land of the drifting clouds?

314
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:54,074
That sounds like fun!

315
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:56,701
It's a death sentence. You die!

316
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:59,454
[ALL]
We-We die?

317
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:17,305
[ZORO]
You really got him good, Nami.

318
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,808
But come on, a death
sentence in God's land?

319
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:21,726
That's quite a contradiction.

320
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,771
But it's the truth!
This is very serious!

321
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:26,981
They'll put you and your
ship on a small cloud

322
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:28,566
and set you adrift in the sea

323
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,194
with no chance of
rescue or escape.

324
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:34,864
You'll eventually die a very
slow and painful death.

325
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:36,741
It's terrible!

326
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:38,118
Interesting.

327
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:40,829
That must be why we saw
that ship fall from the sky.

328
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:42,664
Wait, what are you
talking about?

329
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:45,083
Don't you remember that
galleon we saw falling?

330
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,544
The St. Briss,
I think it was called.

331
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:48,920
For all we know,

332
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:51,548
that crew could've been
punished over 200 years ago.

333
00:14:51,631 --> 00:14:52,674
[gulps]

334
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:02,892
[WHITE BERETS]
You! Criminals!

335
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:05,270
[WHITE BERET B] Do you scum know
what you've done to our Captain?

336
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:06,146
Who cares?

337
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:07,814
Sanji, let me handle this.

338
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:09,190
Anything for you!

339
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:11,901
Don't take it so personally.
It was a lucky shot!

340
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:13,319
[WHITE BERET B]
A lucky shot?

341
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:15,238
[NAMI]
Completely unintentional!

342
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,406
You're lying!

343
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:17,991
[NAMI]
No, I'm telling you the truth.

344
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:19,576
It was an accident. I swear!

345
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,703
An accident?

346
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:23,621
Uh. Okay, guys.

347
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:26,041
Look, try wrapping
your heads around this.

348
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:27,792
It was an accident
because those wavers

349
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,336
are really hard to control,

350
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:31,880
and it was only my first
time to ever pilot one.

351
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:34,257
So I made a little mistake
while I was turning.

352
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:36,468
Yeah, I'll admit that
makes me clumsy,

353
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:38,345
but can you blame a
beginner for messing up

354
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:40,180
and nearly killing your boss?

355
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:41,514
[LUFFY] That's weird,
seemed like you had

356
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:43,141
a pretty good handle
on it to me.

357
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:44,559
[NAMI]
Shuddup!

358
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:46,102
Quiet, Luffy!

359
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:48,605
Nami's trying to trick them into
thinking it was an accident.

360
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:50,065
Don't blow it, okay?

361
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:51,274
All right!

362
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:52,400
[PAGAYA]
Gentlemen.

363
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,152
As important as your
investigation is,

364
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:57,238
perhaps it would be best to get
the captain to a doctor first.

365
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:58,365
Just a thought.

366
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:00,909
Oh. Right! The captain!

367
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:02,410
[PAGAYA]
Now, there's no reason to panic.

368
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,120
Let's take him to my house.

369
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:05,538
We'll get right on that.

370
00:16:05,622 --> 00:16:06,915
[WHITE BERETS]
Heso!

371
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:10,251
[WHITE BERET B]
Consider yourselves under

372
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:11,503
preliminary arrest.

373
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:13,588
Don't go anywhere! Got it?

374
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,675
The poor captain's bleeding!

375
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,009
[SANJI]
Why are they crawling again?

376
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:20,720
Can't they just carry him
like normal people?

377
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:22,055
You guys saved my life,

378
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:24,891
so I know you're not as bad
as they claim you are.

379
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:27,435
So take this chance
and get out of here!

380
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,853
Wait!

381
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,108
[NAMI] I think we'd
better take her advice.

382
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:35,443
When I was on the waver,
I saw it for myself.

383
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,862
An island filled with monsters!

384
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:39,906
Great, so you did
exactly what everyone

385
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:41,408
was hoping you wouldn't do.

386
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:44,244
You mean the place we were
told to never ever set foot on?

387
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:45,120
And there's monsters?

388
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:48,123
Whoa! Don't give 'im any ideas!

389
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:49,958
It's nothing to get
excited about, Luffy.

390
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,502
The last thing we need is
to get involved with this.

391
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:55,255
Regardless, we're
leaving, now let's go!

392
00:16:55,338 --> 00:16:57,799
[SANJI] Ah, it'll break my
heart to be away from Conis,

393
00:16:57,882 --> 00:16:59,926
but if that's what
Nami wants, so be it.

394
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,386
[NAMI]
If we stick around any longer,

395
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:04,222
Conis and Pagaya may get
in trouble because of us.

396
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:05,640
[USOPP]
That's true.

397
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,059
Those White Berets will charge
them as our accomplices!

398
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:09,769
If we can escape now on our own,

399
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:11,813
then it shouldn't cause
them any trouble, right?

400
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,356
After all, how can
they be helping us

401
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,816
when they're with that captain?

402
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:17,861
Okay, that's the plan. Let's go!

403
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:24,701
Luffy, what are you doing?

404
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,202
Why are we running away?

405
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:27,787
Because we're in trouble!

406
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:29,581
So what? We're
always in trouble.

407
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:31,416
It's not about just us anymore!

408
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:35,003
If we don't leave, Conis and
Pagaya could get arrested, too!

409
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:37,130
[LUFFY]
They haven't done anything.

410
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:39,924
Whoever arrests
them is an idiot.

411
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:42,135
I know that, but--

412
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:47,891
[CONIS]
Please. Please hurry.

413
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:52,354
The Blue Sea dwellers
will never escape!

414
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:54,856
[MCKINLEY laughs]

415
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:57,442
Can't you two argue on
the boat? Come on!

416
00:17:57,525 --> 00:17:59,361
How many times do
I have to tell you?!

417
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:03,365
Staying here equals more
trouble for everybody!

418
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:05,408
We're in trouble no matter what.

419
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:06,242
[gasps]

420
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:08,161
[CONIS]
Save yourselves!

421
00:18:08,244 --> 00:18:09,245
Please, go!

422
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:10,872
Ugh. Just great.

423
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:12,082
[MCKINLEY]
Be careful, miss.

424
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:13,958
If you say anything to
defend these criminals,

425
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:17,170
I will consider you and
your father accomplices.

426
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:20,507
These people must be punished
to the full extent of the law

427
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,968
for all the abusive language
and deplorable violence.

428
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:27,806
I find them guilty of
fifth degree crimes.

429
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:29,599
In the name of almighty Eneru,

430
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:33,728
you are banished to drift
in the clouds for eternity.

431
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,647
I told you, it was an accident!

432
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,232
Oh. Forget it.

433
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:39,067
Arrest them!

434
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,779
Just run! You can't win!

435
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:47,701
[MCKINLEY]
Fire the milky arrows!

436
00:18:47,784 --> 00:18:48,868
[yelps]

437
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:50,120
Go, Nami! Run!

438
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:51,538
[NAMI]
Ya think?

439
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,209
What the heck?

440
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:58,753
Clouds?

441
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,797
[screams]

442
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,384
[MCKINLEY]
White Berets! Attack!

443
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:18,523
[WHITE BERETS chuckling]

444
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:21,234
Cool trick! Mind if I try?

445
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:23,194
[chuckles]

446
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:27,032
Attack!

447
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:32,245
These clouds are too fluffy!
I can barely run on 'em!

448
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,042
[yells]

449
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,376
Watch out!

450
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,339
Those fools. They think
they can get away from us?

451
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:50,597
Awesome. Are those cloud skates?

452
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,140
Nice!

453
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:56,311
[LUFFY]
I gotta get a pair of those!

454
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:07,155
Whoa!

455
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:08,907
You see his arm?

456
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,950
[CONIS]
Look! He's all stretchy!

457
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:12,118
I hope he's okay!

458
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:14,287
[chuckles]

459
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:17,665
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

460
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,168
No way! Devil Fruit!

461
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:23,588
[LUFFY]
...Fireworks!

462
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:29,135
[WHITE BERETS yell]

463
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,042
[ZORO]
Piece of cake.

464
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:04,212
Nami! How's the money
situation looking?

465
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:06,006
[NAMI]
Fifty thousand Berries left!

466
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,675
[ZORO] Fifty thousand?
We're that broke?

467
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:11,636
[NAMI] Normally that'd last
us a day or two at most.

468
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,888
What's the deal?
Why are we so poor?

469
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,641
Listen up, everybody! Your
captain has something to say!

470
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:18,685
Everyone on my ship
needs to be more good

471
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:19,728
with money from now on!

472
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,354
So lead by example!

473
00:21:21,438 --> 00:21:22,230
Huh?!

474
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:23,273
[USOPP sighs]

475
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:25,275
In any case,
the Fighting Formation B

476
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:27,110
I taught them to use
was successful.

477
00:21:27,193 --> 00:21:27,986
There's that.

478
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:29,237
Really?

479
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,947
They defeated the White Berets.

480
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:32,574
Unbelievable!

481
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:34,534
At this altitude,
the athletic ability

482
00:21:34,617 --> 00:21:37,871
of Blue Sea dwellers
usually decreases.

483
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:43,168
[laughs]

484
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:45,628
[MCKINLEY]
Those poor deluded fools.

485
00:21:45,712 --> 00:21:48,840
[MCKINLEY] Sorry, criminals!
You have no chance of escape!

486
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:49,924
[SANJI]
Hm?

487
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,176
[MCKINLEY]
You should have behaved

488
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:53,887
and done what I told you to do.

489
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,265
Of all the upholders
of Law here in Skypiea,

490
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,809
we White Berets are
the most lenient.

491
00:21:59,893 --> 00:22:04,314
However, they are not
nearly as forgiving!

492
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:06,191
[MCKINLEY laughs]

493
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:07,776
[MCKINLEY]
Congratulations!

494
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,279
You are now considered
second degree criminals.

495
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,823
You can try to cry for mercy...

496
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:15,742
[MCKINLEY laughs]

497
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:18,370
[MCKINLEY]
...but you will all be judged...

498
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,623
...by the Priests of Upper Yard!

499
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:23,083
Heso!

500
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:30,674
<i>Now, I look up and see,</i>
<i>there's something out there,</i>

501
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:34,302
<i>beyond the endless</i>
<i>clear-blue sky...</i>

502
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:38,014
<i>Possibilities,</i>
<i>of just what could be,</i>

503
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:45,146
<i>a "someday" I'll see if I try...</i>

504
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:01,663
<i>When I am alone</i>

505
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:07,502
<i>all of the memories go</i>
<i>racing through my mind...</i>

506
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:10,005
<i>The things that</i>
<i>I've said and done,</i>

507
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:14,801
<i>the ones I've lost,</i>
<i>the dreams I left behind...</i>

508
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:19,806
<i>Sometimes I felt like</i>
<i>I would defeat myself</i>

509
00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:22,267
<i>until I recalled...</i>

510
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,980
<i>That there was a warm place</i>
<i>I could always go</i>

511
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:30,734
<i>if I happened to fall...</i>

512
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:36,489
<i>With friends and family...</i>
<i>Who'd pick me up...</i>

513
00:23:42,746 --> 00:23:44,539
[NAMI]
That old lady ratted us out!

514
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:46,791
[LUFFY] You're not used to
that kinda thing by now?

515
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,918
Come on. Now, let's get
this adventure crackin'!

516
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:51,129
[NAMI] You still wanna
go to the Upper Yard.

517
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:53,214
[USOPP] Uh, hey, something's
wrong with the ship!

518
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,591
[ROBIN]
Our punishment has begun.

519
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:56,384
We can't stop what's
been set in motion.

520
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,761
[ZORO]
You mean Heaven's Judgment.

521
00:23:57,844 --> 00:23:59,429

On the next One Piece!

522
00:23:59,512 --> 00:24:03,224
"Is Escape Possible? God's
Challenge is Set in Motion."

523
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,852
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
