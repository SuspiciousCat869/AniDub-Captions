00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.330
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:42.905
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:38.016
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.922
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:46.132
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.638
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:51.911
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:53.748
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:56.152
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:59.191
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:03.501
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.136
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.877
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:13.152
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:17.127
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.198
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:21.469
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.504 --> 00:03:24.208
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:27.882
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.688
However, Luffy becomes
sidetracked by a tournament

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:33.861
that offers the
Flame Flame Fruit as a prize.

00:03:33.894 --> 00:03:36.032
[REBECCA]
Are you interested in him?

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:38.337
[LUFFY]
Huh? Who're you?

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.643
[REBECCA] I'm Rebecca.
A gladiator here.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:47.555
This statue before you.
This man was a legend.

00:03:47.588 --> 00:03:50.194
[LUFFY] Whoa, really?
The giant old dude?

00:03:50.227 --> 00:03:52.832
In the entire history
of the Colosseum,

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:56.272
there's never been a greater
gladiator than Kyros.

00:03:56.306 --> 00:03:58.611
[NARRATOR] The Block A round
of the tournament concludes

00:03:58.644 --> 00:04:02.184
and the victor is Burgess
from the Blackbeard Pirates.

00:04:03.353 --> 00:04:07.261
[NARRATOR] Now, the battle for
Block B is about to start.

00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:08.897
But first...

00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:17.515
[BELLAMY chuckles]

00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:20.320
[BELLAMY]
Hey.

00:04:20.353 --> 00:04:21.489
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:25.197
Nice get up, but do ya
think I'm blind?

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.368
I don't care how good
the disguise is,

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:28.871
when it comes to
the guy who managed to

00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:31.643
swerve my career
into the skids...

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.985
...I'll know his face.

00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:38.957
[LUFFY gasps]
It's you?

00:05:08.617 --> 00:05:10.153
[LUFFY]
You're a jerk.

00:05:10.186 --> 00:05:13.760
You really messed up
that poor chestnut head guy.

00:05:14.696 --> 00:05:16.366
[LUFFY]
I'll be back by morning, guys.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:20.842
[BELLAMY cackles]
There's no city of gold,

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:22.846
no island in the sky.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.952
Just oceans and ships
and the men who sail them.

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:29.091
The time for dreaming's over!

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:35.170
Lammy. Right?

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:36.206
[BELLAMY]
It's Bellamy!

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:38.544
Yeah. Lammy.

00:05:38.577 --> 00:05:40.949
But wait, what're
you doing here?

00:05:40.982 --> 00:05:42.986
[BELLAMY]
What d'you care?

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:46.226
It's not like I'm
glued to Jaya, y'know.

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.365
I can go wherever I please.

00:05:49.398 --> 00:05:53.741
Besides. Doflamingo is
a real hero of mine.

00:05:53.774 --> 00:05:56.847
I've been a fan
ever since I was a kid.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.853
I don't care about
the Flame Flame Fruit,

00:05:59.887 --> 00:06:03.627
but I still have plenty to gain
by busting some heads out there.

00:06:03.661 --> 00:06:06.065
I'll take you down as
many times as I need to.

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.304
I'll warn you, I'm not
the same man as before.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.244
For starters,

00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:15.751
I saw the Sky Island,
just like you.

00:06:15.784 --> 00:06:17.287
Y'mean Skypeia?

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.860
[BELLAMY] I lost all of
my crewmates on that trip,

00:06:19.893 --> 00:06:23.032
but it turned my view of the
whole damned world upside down.

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:24.669
[LUFFY]
What happened up there?

00:06:24.702 --> 00:06:27.173
You didn't hurt anyone, did you?

00:06:30.347 --> 00:06:32.050
Maybe.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.455
[BELLAMY]
Anyway.

00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:37.628
I'm not going to hold
a grudge against you anymore.

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:40.466
[BELLAMY] There's a
big wave that's about to

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:42.438
crash through this world,

00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:46.111
and I think that Doflamingo's
ship can ride it out.

00:06:47.013 --> 00:06:50.988
[BELLAMY] Either way,
I'm done laughing at you.

00:07:06.453 --> 00:07:08.055
[BARTOLOMEO]
Hey.

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.825
So you're going to
Green Bit, huh?

00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:28.764
You can, but I sure
wouldn't recommend it.

00:07:28.798 --> 00:07:32.606
You researchers?
Explorers, what?

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.543
We're, uh, a little of both.

00:07:34.576 --> 00:07:37.849
Whatever you want, is it
worth risking your life over?

00:07:37.882 --> 00:07:40.086
'Cause it'd better be.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.592
The bridge there.
What is it made of?

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:44.763
It looks unusual.

00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:48.036
[WAITER A] It's solid iron,
but that doesn't make it safe.

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:50.306
Well, that's obvious enough.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.348
As you can see, nobody's
brave enough to use it.

00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:56.385
There's a school of
fighting fish nearby,

00:07:56.418 --> 00:07:59.826
the seas around Green Bit
are full of the things.

00:07:59.859 --> 00:08:01.596
Before those monsters moved in,

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.769
people used to go to and
from Green Bit all the time,

00:08:04.802 --> 00:08:06.540
but that was about
200 years ago.

00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:10.413
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles]
These fish, what're they like?

00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:13.486
Nasty horns, nasty disposition.

00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:15.725
Take a ship and
they'll capsize you.

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:18.096
Oh, and they'll
attack the bridge, too.

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:20.400
That's what all those
iron bars are for.

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:22.638
Although I hear that
barely slows 'em down.

00:08:22.672 --> 00:08:25.009
Wait a sec. They're fish!

00:08:25.042 --> 00:08:26.546
What, do they fly
out of the water

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.249
and tear straight
through solid iron?

00:08:28.282 --> 00:08:31.890
Maybe! Not brave enough
to see, myself!

00:08:31.923 --> 00:08:34.328
I know plenty of people
who've tried to go,

00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:36.633
but I don't know anyone
who's come back.

00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:39.506
What? Traffy! What gives?

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.143
Why'd you pick such a dangerous
spot for the tradeoff?

00:08:42.177 --> 00:08:46.285
No kidding! Can't you hand me
over someplace nice? You fool!

00:08:46.319 --> 00:08:48.255
--[USOPP] Yeah!
--Deal with it.

00:08:51.395 --> 00:08:54.034
No point in complaining.
We're already here.

00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:57.007
More importantly, don't you
think the people in this country

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.846
are acting kind of strange?

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:02.619
Doflamingo said he stepped down.

00:09:02.652 --> 00:09:06.358
If they don't have a king,
why is everybody so calm?

00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:08.864
We were taken by surprise
the moment we got here.

00:09:08.897 --> 00:09:10.500
That's what worries me!

00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:13.239
[ROBIN chuckles, gasps]

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.449
Hey, Robin,
is something wrong, or?

00:09:18.483 --> 00:09:19.886
Shh.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.727
[gasps]

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:28.003
Am I supposed to
know those weirdos?

00:09:28.036 --> 00:09:29.806
CP Zero.

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:32.444
[USOPP]
"CP"? Wait a second!

00:09:32.478 --> 00:09:34.347
Holy crap, what the hell?

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.657
[ROBIN] The strongest
intelligence agents

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.393
in the world.

00:09:40.427 --> 00:09:43.165
Cypher Pol Aigis 0.

00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:48.343
Like CP9? Please tell me
they're not that tough.

00:09:48.376 --> 00:09:50.848
I'm afraid that they're
much more dangerous.

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:52.116
[USOPP gasps]

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.355
You don't think they're here
'cause of us though, do you?

00:09:54.388 --> 00:09:56.258
Maybe they're on
vacation or something?

00:09:56.291 --> 00:09:58.329
Whatever their objective may be,

00:09:58.362 --> 00:10:01.570
if they're here,
it can't be good news.

00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:03.507
I can't disagree.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.766
You're not getting away,
you thieving fairy!

00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:22.645
[ZORO groans]

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:31.161
[gasps]

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:36.205
[ZORO groans]
Lost 'em.

00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:39.077
Over there!

00:10:40.013 --> 00:10:41.148
[ZORO gasps]

00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:44.421
You're mine!

00:10:45.624 --> 00:10:48.329
[ZORO]
Tricky little punk!

00:10:48.362 --> 00:10:51.469
[yells]

00:10:51.503 --> 00:10:53.874
I got you now, fairy!

00:10:57.147 --> 00:10:59.586
[ZORO] I'll be taking my
sword back, thank you.

00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:01.589
[WICKA screams]

00:11:03.326 --> 00:11:05.530
[gasps]

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.375
[WICKA]
Uh-oh!

00:11:11.408 --> 00:11:13.312
[ZORO groans]

00:11:13.346 --> 00:11:15.918
[WICKA]
Owie, ow, ow. Dang it!

00:11:15.951 --> 00:11:19.525
I really messed up!
That human's gonna see me!

00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:23.700
[WICKA] Run you dummy!
Come on, hurry!

00:11:26.706 --> 00:11:28.175
[gasps]

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.667
Kanjuro! I have
come to save you!

00:11:42.671 --> 00:11:47.681
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES chuckle]

00:11:52.558 --> 00:11:55.463
What do you want?
Who are you?

00:11:55.496 --> 00:11:57.400
There is no need for hostility!

00:11:57.433 --> 00:11:59.538
I'm just an old man passing by!

00:11:59.572 --> 00:12:01.008
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Not likely.

00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:04.615
For starters, what's with
that topknot under your hat?

00:12:06.385 --> 00:12:09.993
This? No, it's simply
a topknot shaped hat.

00:12:10.026 --> 00:12:11.262
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Then, take it off.

00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:14.435
[KIN'EMON gasps] I have
an embarrassing deformity!

00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:16.004
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Heh. Give it up.

00:12:16.038 --> 00:12:17.809
We know you're a samurai.

00:12:17.842 --> 00:12:20.480
Foxfire Kin'emon, right?

00:12:20.515 --> 00:12:22.017
I know nothing of samurai.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.054
I've never heard of the man!

00:12:24.088 --> 00:12:25.691
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
We saw you in the video

00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:28.597
Caesar was broadcasting
from Punk Hazard.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.235
You samurai are
big on honor, aren't you?

00:12:31.268 --> 00:12:33.272
You had to come back.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.980
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
And we were ready for you.

00:12:37.013 --> 00:12:39.351
Evidently, not ready enough!

00:12:39.385 --> 00:12:42.825
Gentleman, you are
making a terrible mistake.

00:12:42.858 --> 00:12:45.765
To take aim at a samurai
is to invite death!

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:47.668
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Whoa, easy there.

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:50.340
If you don't want your
buddy Kanjuro to get hurt,

00:12:50.373 --> 00:12:51.843
you'll put that away.

00:12:51.877 --> 00:12:54.214
What? You know of Kanjuro?

00:12:54.247 --> 00:12:57.688
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A laughs]
Yeah. So why don't you

00:12:57.721 --> 00:13:01.229
move that hand away
from your sword for me?

00:13:01.262 --> 00:13:02.632
You cur!

00:13:02.665 --> 00:13:05.370
Then you also must know
where to find him!

00:13:05.403 --> 00:13:06.673
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Of course I do,

00:13:06.707 --> 00:13:09.477
but if you don't start
playing nice real fast,

00:13:09.512 --> 00:13:12.316
I'll be more than happy
to kill the both of you.

00:13:15.624 --> 00:13:19.699
[CROWD cheering]

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:22.538
Now, the time has arrived!
At long last,

00:13:22.572 --> 00:13:25.243
our second set of fearsome
fighters is entering the ring,

00:13:25.276 --> 00:13:27.982
so I hope you're
ready for Block B!

[LUFFY] Aw jeez, I better
hurry! It's starting!

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:40.507
Wow! We got a great
view up here!

00:13:58.543 --> 00:14:02.317
Gotta admit, that's pretty
dirty-handed of you.

00:14:02.351 --> 00:14:05.557
Not cool, Mister Navy Man.

00:14:05.591 --> 00:14:08.396
This fight is suposed
to be fair and square.

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:10.099
But with all these
big name pirates,

00:14:10.132 --> 00:14:12.404
you couldn't resist, could ya?

00:14:12.437 --> 00:14:13.640
You're full of it.

00:14:13.673 --> 00:14:16.646
[BARTOLOMEO chuckles]
You think playing dumb'll

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.382
get you off the hook, huh?

00:14:18.416 --> 00:14:21.489
Sorry, but if you pick
a fight with my buddies,

00:14:21.523 --> 00:14:23.727
then you're picking
a fight with me, as well.

00:14:23.761 --> 00:14:25.998
And if you insist
on raising a stink,

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:29.806
then I'll have to
silence you. Bartolomeo.

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:33.445
You know my name!
I feel like a real celebrity!

00:15:15.462 --> 00:15:17.167
Violet, my dear.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.169
What's wrong?

00:15:18.202 --> 00:15:20.675
Nothing! I just wanted
to say your name!

00:15:20.708 --> 00:15:22.176
I see!

00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:28.022
Say, Sanji.

00:15:28.055 --> 00:15:29.892
Uh-huh?

00:15:29.925 --> 00:15:33.399
I just wanted to say your name.

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:05.296
We're safe now!

[SANJI]
Dearest Nami. Dearest Robin.

00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:11.408
I hope the weather is
nice where you are.

00:16:11.442 --> 00:16:14.380
[SANJI]
Yeehaw!

00:16:16.686 --> 00:16:19.491
My goodness! You're strong!

00:16:19.525 --> 00:16:20.493
That was amazing!

00:16:20.527 --> 00:16:21.762
No, no!

00:16:21.796 --> 00:16:24.401
Anyone can detect a sniper
from over a hundred feet away!

00:16:24.434 --> 00:16:26.005
It was nothing at all, really!

00:16:26.038 --> 00:16:27.942
Oh, my hero!

00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:31.315
[SANJI] As for me,
I'm trapped in a hurricane.

00:16:31.348 --> 00:16:36.391
That is to say,
a hurricane called "love."

00:16:36.424 --> 00:16:38.129
[SANJI laughs]

00:16:38.162 --> 00:16:40.867
You can always count on me!

00:16:56.198 --> 00:16:58.068
[MOMONOSUKE]
Wrong! All wrong!

00:16:58.102 --> 00:16:59.839
You're not supposed to
drink the tea, you fool!

00:16:59.873 --> 00:17:00.674
Huh?

00:17:00.708 --> 00:17:03.045
You test for poison.

00:17:03.078 --> 00:17:04.949
Then, once you're
certain that it's safe,

00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:07.454
you give the tea to
the shogun, who is me!

00:17:07.487 --> 00:17:11.295
If it's not safe, then you
simply die. Get it?

00:17:11.328 --> 00:17:12.798
Uh-huh!

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:14.101
Do it again.

00:17:14.134 --> 00:17:15.437

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.672
My tea.

00:17:16.706 --> 00:17:17.808
[CHOPPER]
As you wish.

00:17:17.841 --> 00:17:20.981
I shall return shortly
with your beverage.

00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:27.127
Shogun. I hope that
my lap is to your liking.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.798
It is most satisfactory.

00:17:29.832 --> 00:17:33.272
In fact, I might stay
like this all day long.

00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:37.413
I see. You're welcome
to do so, My Lord.

00:17:39.985 --> 00:17:44.895
I might stay like this
all day! [chuckles]

Ugh! How awful of you!

00:17:50.874 --> 00:17:52.077
And why?

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.651
Oh, you mean this wasn't
a "sleeping on your lap" party?

00:17:55.684 --> 00:17:57.387
What d'you think, Brook?

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.324
Play along!

00:17:59.357 --> 00:18:00.393
It's a game!

00:18:00.426 --> 00:18:02.230
Pretending Momo's the Shogun!

00:18:02.264 --> 00:18:04.500
I'm afraid I don't follow.

00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:06.071
It's sad.

00:18:06.104 --> 00:18:07.975
If we leave Momo alone,

00:18:08.008 --> 00:18:11.782
he gets all depressed about
something and nobody knows why.

00:18:11.816 --> 00:18:14.688
He's probably just pretending
to get our sympathy.

00:18:14.722 --> 00:18:18.095
C'mon, Brook!
I feel bad for him!

00:18:18.128 --> 00:18:19.565
He doesn't want to
share it with us,

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:22.170
but I think he went through
something real bad.

00:18:22.204 --> 00:18:23.573
Huh?

00:18:23.606 --> 00:18:27.214
I didn't notice myself,
but I trust your opinion.

00:18:27.247 --> 00:18:30.621
Perhaps, he's acting
cheery for our sake?

00:18:30.654 --> 00:18:34.762
He's sad, but he doesn't
want to worry his friends.

00:18:34.795 --> 00:18:36.365
I had it all backwards!

00:18:36.398 --> 00:18:38.168

from Captain Luffy!
