fairly frequently in this area.

an unusual number

the work of pirates,
or simply a lost child.

possible the incidents

00:10:40.097 --> 00:10:42.350
As it happens, you're in luck.

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:44.685
We've just finished
a new medicine.

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:46.228
Exactly what you need.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.564
It will both warm and heal you.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:50.900
[CENTAUR A]
Really? That's so kind!

00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:52.443
Will you help the others, too?

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:55.071
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Shurorororo! Certainly.

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.740
But first let's get you treated.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.451
[CENTAUR A]
You do so much for us, Master!

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.495
I don't know how to repay you.

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:06.624
[SANJI (NAMI)] Are you kidding?
What the hell is this, Usopp?

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:09.585
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)] I think
they're totally super, bro!

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.420
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
I don't care anymore.

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:13.923
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
Thanks, Usopp! Great idea!

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.801
This thing detracts
from Nami's beauty!

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:18.386
Aw, quit whining!

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:19.929
Without some sort of
system like this,

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.722
we're never gonna
remember who's who.

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:23.432
So Brownbeard, huh?

00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:24.433
[USOPP]
Hm?

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:26.811
That's right.
I'm sure you've heard that name.

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:28.646
It's what I used to go by.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:29.814
[LUFFY]
Nope, sorry.

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:31.607
Are you kidding, you fool?

00:11:31.607 --> 00:11:33.901
Hey, get off of me
before I bite you!

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.152
Something's up.

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:38.406
You wouldn't say a word before,
and now you won't stop yapping.

00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:40.491
Why're you so eager
to run your mouth now?

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.784
Oh ho.

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:44.620
I'm in a good mood because
you guys are in for it.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.498
Law knows that I'm with you now,
and he's gonna come for me.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.458
I despise all the
worthless pirates

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.460
of your damn generation.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.962
Law's the exception.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:53.921
Hold on.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.798
What do you mean
"our generation"?

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.174
Don't you know anything?

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:59.468
Little fool.

00:11:59.468 --> 00:12:01.137
I mean the 11 rookies
with bounties

00:12:01.178 --> 00:12:03.931
over 100 million who
arrived at Sabaody

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.349
two years ago.

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:08.018
You lot, and Blackbeard.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.980
People call you punks
"The Worst Generation."

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.815
Troublemakers who were
born at the change

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:14.150
of the era.

00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:16.152
Reckless fools whose
actions will determine

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:18.529
the future of this world.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.448
After Whitebeard died,
you all came

00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:22.992
to the New World
and began raising hell.

00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:24.827
Anytime something big happened,

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:26.829
a member of your
generation was usually

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:28.831
right in the thick of things.

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:35.838
Blackbeard, Kid, Law,
Drake, and Hawkins.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.340
Basil Hawkins was the one
who shattered my crew,

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.469
leaving us defeated and broken.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.388
It was because of him that
my pirate career ended.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.515
The coward took my legs from me.

00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:48.642
My crew was annihilated.

00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:50.394
I was fleeing for
my life when at last,

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:55.524
I arrived here, on the island
known as Punk Hazard.

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:58.110
Do you fools even know
what this place is?

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:05.993
This island is not what it was.

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:08.996
It used to be a paradise,
teeming with life.

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:11.499
Home to creatures of
all shapes and colors.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.583
Wow, for real?

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.251
It's nothing like that anymore.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.437
[BROWNBEARD] This island
housed the laboratory

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:37.066
of a Government scientist
known as Dr. Vegapunk.

00:13:37.107 --> 00:13:38.943
He and his team
were stationed here

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:41.070
with the task of
developing new chemicals

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.488
and weapons.

00:13:46.116 --> 00:13:48.244
Vegapunk needed subjects
on which to test

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:49.703
his inventions.

00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:53.082
So, instead of going to prison,
criminals were sent here,

00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:56.043
where they were experimented on.

00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:58.254
Four years ago,
Vegapunk tested one of his

00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:01.423
chemical weapons, and it
went very, very wrong.

00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:28.909
Two of the three labs exploded,
destroyed almost entirely.

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.787
We are standing in the
remains of one right now.

00:14:31.787 --> 00:14:32.830
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.610
That makes sense.

00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:05.070
A huge explosion would
do this kind of damage.

00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:07.281
So Robin's theory
was right after all.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.912
Intense heat and
toxic substances

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:14.580
seeped into the air,

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.290
and none of the
plants or animals

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.083
on the island survived.

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:38.437
The Government ordered
the island evacuated,

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:40.105
retrieving their own
people but leaving

00:15:40.147 --> 00:15:42.066
the test subjects behind.

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:44.443
Vegapunk's operation
was shut down,

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:49.114
and his guinea pigs were
thrown away like trash.

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:50.950
They did what they
could to survive,

00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:52.993
taking shelter in
the Third Laboratory,

00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:54.995
the only one still intact.

00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:57.122
There, they were protected
from the poison gas

00:15:57.164 --> 00:16:00.250
that contaminated
the entire island.

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.002
Those who survived
were paralyzed

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.630
from exposure to the gas,
which stole the use

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.465
of their lower bodies.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:09.802
They lived on, without any
real hope for the future.

00:16:09.843 --> 00:16:11.470
But then...

00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:14.473
...a year later,
everything changed.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:16.642
A kind master arrived
on the island,

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:19.812
restoring the hope
that had been lost.

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:22.272
With his ability,
he purified the island

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:23.857
of the toxic gas.

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:25.818
He also gave the prisoners
who couldn't walk

00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:28.278
the mechanical means to move.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.531
More than that,
he gave them purpose

00:16:30.572 --> 00:16:32.866
by making them his
loyal subordinates.

00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:36.662
[cries] Kind Master!

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:38.330
Master!

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.708
Merciful Master!

00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:43.210
I came to the island
a year after that,

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:44.878
desperate and broken.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.006
Two years have passed
since my arrival.

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:02.187
Some toxic substances
remained in the air

00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:06.316
even then, and breathing it
left me feeling nauseous.

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:09.695
I began to think I had no
more strength to carry on.

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:12.698
I had fought to survive,
but I was reaching the end.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:19.997
But then I saw them:

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.041
the men who had lost
the use of their legs,

00:17:22.082 --> 00:17:24.334
just as I had.

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:26.879
And with them, the Master.

00:17:32.926 --> 00:17:34.887
I owe everything to him.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.222
His kindness saved my life
as it saved others

00:17:37.264 --> 00:17:39.224
before me.

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:42.686
Vegapunk and his experiments
stole my comrades' legs.

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:46.899
But then the Master arrived,
a kind and generous savior.

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:52.738
[BOTH crying]

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.615
Master!

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.242
[BROWNBEARD]
And then a few months ago,

00:17:57.284 --> 00:17:59.369
fate brought us
another surprise.

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.913
Trafalgar Law.

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:03.415
A Warlord arrived on
the island and became

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:06.251
our second savior.

00:18:06.293 --> 00:18:08.378
Using his special ability,

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.631
he gave legs to those
of us who couldn't walk

00:18:10.672 --> 00:18:12.925
without mechanical assistance.

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.094
They were the legs
of living animals!

00:18:21.016 --> 00:18:23.227
We thought we would
never walk again,

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:26.730
so we wept when our
bodies were restored.

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:29.942
Oh, my gosh, that's the most
beautiful story ever!

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:32.736
You see? I told you Traffy
was a good guy.

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:35.114
I'm not the only one
whose life he saved.

00:18:35.155 --> 00:18:37.825
How could Dr. Vegapunk do
something so horrible?

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:40.244
Well, I guess this explains
the half-sheep people.

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:41.954
The ones back at the laboratory.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.789
Centaurs and the bird-woman.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.415
It all makes sense now.

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.793
'Cept the dragon.
What's up with that?

00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:50.587
Ah, yes.
Saw the dragon, did you?

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:53.132
That's just an artificial
creature Vegapunk created

00:18:53.173 --> 00:18:56.301
to guard the island from
unwanted visitors.

00:18:56.343 --> 00:18:59.429
It can adapt to any
environment imaginable.

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:01.306
I heard one of the
World Nobles liked it

00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:02.975
and gave it a name.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:06.812
I forgot what it was,
but run if you see it.

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:08.856
It's very aggressive.

00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:10.107
I'm not worried.

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.483
[ZORO]
We already ate it.

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:13.443
Now you know who's in
charge on the island

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:15.279
and why we're here.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.489
Nobody else dares
to come near it now.

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:19.283
It belongs to the Master.

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:21.618
Punk Hazard is the
domain of our savior.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.289
[BROWNBEARD chuckles]
No, don't cry.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.874
The Master continues
his research

00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:28.959
for the betterment of mankind.

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:31.003
To do so, he needs
test subjects,

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:34.673
and each of you will have
the honor of becoming one.

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:37.759
Like it or not, you're his!

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:51.148
[CAESAR CLOWN] Hm?
Is something the matter?

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.482
[CENTAUR A]
Master!

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:54.484
Master! I can't breathe!

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:58.322
What kind of... [coughs]
...medicine is this?

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:00.365
[coughs]

00:20:00.407 --> 00:20:02.201
Please, Master!

00:20:02.242 --> 00:20:03.410
[coughs]

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:04.536
Master!

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:07.706
[coughing]

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:09.833
Please just
let me out of here.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.418
[gasping]

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.879
I need you to hang
on a little longer.

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:15.547
Describe how you feel.

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:19.384
From the sound of it,

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:21.261
there's some nausea
and coughing.

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:23.055
Does your head hurt, as well?

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:23.931
[CENTAUR A]
Yes!

00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:26.391
It feels like it's
going to split open.

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:29.561
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Yes. Yes. I see.

00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:33.273
[MARINE V]
What? It wasn't Vegapunk?

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:34.858
But he was in charge.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.194
If Vegapunk didn't cause
that huge explosion,

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:38.403
who did, Smokey?

00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:42.741
The person who made the weapon
and accidentally set it off.

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:44.284
That was Caesar Clown.

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:45.410
[MARINES gasp]

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:49.581
He and Vegapunk worked together.

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:52.417
Ceasar Clown was
second in command here.

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:55.796
But because of his tendency
towards inhumane methods,

00:20:55.837 --> 00:20:59.132
he and Vegapunk butted
heads frequently.

00:20:59.174 --> 00:21:00.801
P-Please, Master.

00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:06.098
Please help me.

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:07.266
[gasping]

00:21:07.307 --> 00:21:08.809
Shurorororo!

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.560
How are your eyes doing?

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:12.980
Are you seeing anything strange?

00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:17.985
[CENTAUR A] Huh? Oh!
Yes, there's a giant snake!

00:21:18.026 --> 00:21:21.238
[yelling]

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.657
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Shurorororo! Too bad!

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:25.951
All right, that's enough.
Goodbye now.

00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:35.627
After the accident happened,

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:37.504
Vegapunk was listed
as responsible

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:40.007
because he was
the person in charge.

00:21:40.048 --> 00:21:42.134
Of course, it was
a crime to develop

00:21:42.175 --> 00:21:44.303
a chemical weapon
of mass destruction

00:21:44.344 --> 00:21:46.305
that could take out
an entire island.

00:21:46.346 --> 00:21:48.265
When Caesar Clown's
involvement came to light

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:51.643
after the explosion,
he was arrested.

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:54.688
But using his
formidable ability,

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.940
he escaped from a prison ship,

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:59.943
and his location
has been unknown since.

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:01.653
If my suspicions are correct,

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:03.322
and Caesar is back
here on this island

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:05.532
conducting experiments,

00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:07.993
we have to stop him!

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:10.162
Before he does something
even more horrible

00:22:10.203 --> 00:22:11.496
than before.

00:22:12.914 --> 00:22:13.999
"Giant snake."

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:20.672
Was this one another failure?

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:22.132
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Huh?

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:23.717
"Falure," you say?

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:26.136
You really should
watch your tongue.

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:28.180
My experiments
are never failures,

00:22:28.221 --> 00:22:31.224
not even what happened
four years ago.

00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:33.477
None of the useless idiots
in the World Government

00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:35.520
know what they're talking about.

00:22:35.562 --> 00:22:37.064
A failed experiment?

00:22:37.105 --> 00:22:40.650
I developed a weapon that
killed an entire island!

00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:43.362
How is that anything
but a success?

00:22:43.403 --> 00:22:46.990
I proved myself the most
efficient killer in the world!

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:48.867
Didn't I?!

00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:51.370
I meticulously document
each of my victims

00:22:51.411 --> 00:22:53.747
until they draw
their final breath!

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:55.499
Just you wait!

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.542
Soon it will be my day,

00:22:57.542 --> 00:22:59.378
and they'll know I'm
the greatest scientist

00:22:59.419 --> 00:23:00.754
who ever lived!

00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:02.589
Shurorororororo!
Shurorororororo!

00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:10.597
Shurorororororo!

00:23:16.103 --> 00:23:18.522
[NARRATOR] Struck by a
sudden terrible pain,

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:21.900
the children begin to collapse
one after another.

00:23:21.942 --> 00:23:24.403
The Straw Hat crew is shocked
when Chopper reveals

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:26.113
the horrifying cause.

00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:29.282
Meanwhile, Zoro's group sets out
to find the

00:23:29.324 --> 00:23:33.620
unaware of the colossal
shadows looming nearby.

00:23:33.662 --> 00:23:35.372
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:39.126
"Chopper's Fury! The Master's
Inhumane Experiment!"

00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:41.753
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
