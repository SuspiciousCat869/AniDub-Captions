00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.071
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:08.074
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.414
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.515
You can have it!

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.620
Now, you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.555
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.626
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:34.593 --> 00:02:37.009
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.043 --> 00:02:39.912
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:45.184
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.217 --> 00:02:47.286
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.956
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.858
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:52.892 --> 00:02:55.261
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.294 --> 00:02:59.532
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.565 --> 00:03:02.635
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body became rubber

00:03:02.668 --> 00:03:04.236
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.907
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.078
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.614 --> 00:03:17.583
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:20.319
Luffy and his crew arrive
on the Fishman Island,

00:03:20.353 --> 00:03:24.423
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:24.457 --> 00:03:26.726
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones,

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:31.497
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.332
It is not long before
the Straw Hats

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:34.867
get pulled into the conflict,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.903
and find themselves in the
midst of an all-out war!

00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:39.572
After a change of plans,

00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:41.907
Hordy threatens to
crush the entire island

00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:44.443
under the weight of
a massive ship.

00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:47.847
[HORDY] Either way,
the whole island is doomed!

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.149
That includes your
friends, the princess,

00:03:50.182 --> 00:03:52.551
and everyone else down there!

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:54.553
You're just a weakling! Get it?

00:03:54.587 --> 00:03:56.756
You can't protect anyone!

00:03:58.023 --> 00:04:00.126
Watch me.

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.228
I'll save 'em all!

00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:05.998
I trained for two
years. I'm ready!

[HORDY laughs]

00:04:29.922 --> 00:04:32.491
You think you can
save them all.

00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:34.360
Oh, that's rich.

00:04:34.393 --> 00:04:37.797
You talk a big game,
don't you, Straw Hat?

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.534
[laughs]

00:04:44.003 --> 00:04:47.339
This is crazy. He turned
his back on Decken, too?

00:04:47.373 --> 00:04:50.042
Sister, swim away!

00:04:50.075 --> 00:04:53.345
It's up to you to save
our people, Shirahoshi!

00:04:56.048 --> 00:04:58.717
It's a bit late for that.

00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:05.591
[HORDY laughs]

00:05:05.624 --> 00:05:08.427
A bit late? What is
that supposed to mean?

00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:09.595
[MANBOSHI gasps]

00:05:09.628 --> 00:05:13.332
Hold on! Isn't Decken on the
brink of death right now?

00:05:13.365 --> 00:05:15.267
If he dies or passes out,

00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:18.103
the Noah goes back
to normal, right?

00:05:18.137 --> 00:05:24.143
[DECKEN panting]

00:05:35.354 --> 00:05:37.156
His power will go away

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:39.992
and the ship will
stop following her.

00:05:41.126 --> 00:05:45.431
And that mean that...

00:05:45.464 --> 00:05:47.433
...it'll hit the island!

00:05:50.402 --> 00:05:54.440
Why'd you kick me? That hurt!

00:05:54.473 --> 00:05:57.510
Suck it up! I'll kick you
as many times as it takes!

00:05:57.543 --> 00:06:00.112
You're such a meanie!

00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:03.148
Even the captain wouldn't
kick me for no reason!

00:06:05.384 --> 00:06:07.887
Well, you shouldn't
have hurt Nami.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.790
You big waste of space.

00:06:11.824 --> 00:06:14.360
How 'bout another
goose-egg to match?!

00:06:14.393 --> 00:06:16.896
No, get away!

00:06:19.865 --> 00:06:22.134

Next time, be careful...

00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:24.770
...where you drop your fat ass!

00:06:34.213 --> 00:06:37.416
Please don't get any
scratches on that hot body!

Ugh. Not another one!

00:06:40.853 --> 00:06:42.888
Gimme a break!

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE X]
Watch out, she's dangerous!

00:06:45.124 --> 00:06:46.825
Last time she used
that magic wand thing,

00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:48.861
she did some major damage!

00:06:49.862 --> 00:06:52.131
Ha! Black Ball!

00:06:56.702 --> 00:06:57.870
How's she doin' that?

00:06:57.903 --> 00:06:59.605
She must be some kind of witch!

00:06:59.638 --> 00:07:02.541
A witch? That's rude, you guys.

00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:06.779
How 'bout "enchantress"?
That's much nicer.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.685
But it's not magic.

00:07:12.718 --> 00:07:16.188
More like "advanced
meteorology," you might say.

00:07:19.124 --> 00:07:20.259
Uh. Uh-oh.

00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:22.061

00:07:43.816 --> 00:07:46.986
Did you notice how distraught
that black-suited buffoon was

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:50.789
when that woman
fell to the ground?

00:07:50.823 --> 00:07:54.226

discovered his weakness.

Oh, yeah?

I'll make sure she can't move.

Oh, boy. Almost too easy.

00:12:01.974 --> 00:12:04.543
Hey! Chopper!

00:12:04.576 --> 00:12:06.478
Jeez, can't he hear me?

00:12:06.511 --> 00:12:07.412
[gasps]

00:12:07.446 --> 00:12:11.216
I'll crush you into
the ground! Boomsun!

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.919
[CHOPPER]
Usopp! Look out!

00:12:13.952 --> 00:12:16.688
[yells]

00:12:16.722 --> 00:12:19.524
[CHOPPER]
Horn Cannon: Elf!

00:12:19.558 --> 00:12:21.426
Wow. Nice goin'!

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.095
So are all the
tunnels connected?

00:12:23.128 --> 00:12:24.663
Yup! We're good to go!

00:12:24.696 --> 00:12:25.998
Sweet!

00:12:26.031 --> 00:12:31.003
Now... Special Attack:
Green Star!

00:12:36.575 --> 00:12:38.377
[gasps]

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.246
Wait for it! Skull Bombgrass!

00:12:43.348 --> 00:12:45.851
[DARUMA screaming]

00:12:45.884 --> 00:12:49.187
[USOPP]
Heh! Too bad for you, shorty!

00:12:49.221 --> 00:12:51.590
We already fought a tunnel
digger back in Alabasta,

00:12:51.623 --> 00:12:53.625
so we're pros now!

00:12:55.127 --> 00:12:57.496
Heh. Practice makes
perfect, am I right?

00:12:57.529 --> 00:12:58.563
Uh-huh!

00:12:58.597 --> 00:12:59.932
[DARUMA laughs]

00:12:59.965 --> 00:13:02.701
[DOSUN] You tryin' to
make fools out of us?

00:13:02.734 --> 00:13:04.569
[DARUMA]
You screwed up my hard work!

00:13:04.603 --> 00:13:07.773
I'm gonna pulverize you
like the little bug you are!

00:13:07.806 --> 00:13:10.575
I can do some
pulverizing myself!

00:13:11.576 --> 00:13:13.912
I'll bite that ugly nose off!

00:13:13.946 --> 00:13:16.214
Yeah, it's too bad
you can't reach it.

00:13:16.248 --> 00:13:18.183
Back me up here, Chopper.

00:13:21.186 --> 00:13:23.388
Uh, you still there?

00:13:24.823 --> 00:13:26.425
Uh-oh.

00:13:26.458 --> 00:13:28.794
Hey, buddy?

00:13:28.827 --> 00:13:31.663
Ha! Looks like it's my turn now.

00:13:31.697 --> 00:13:33.198
[laughs]

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:39.271
[ALL gasp]

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:42.808
[whimpers]

00:13:42.841 --> 00:13:45.077
[laughs]

00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:50.515
[laughing]

00:13:52.718 --> 00:13:55.187
[chuckles]

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:00.792
Ready-hii?

00:14:00.826 --> 00:14:04.429
Stupidhead! Now you've
made me angry!

00:14:04.463 --> 00:14:08.867
I'm gonna beat you up good!
You might even cry!

00:14:10.068 --> 00:14:13.405
[HYOUZOU] That's it! Ha-ha!
I like your style, kid!

00:14:13.438 --> 00:14:19.911
Finally, I get to
really let loose!

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:56.862
[FISHMAN C]
Ugh... Someone help.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.799
[FISHMAN D] Oh, no!
Let me treat your injuries!

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.834
[MERMAID A]
It's okay, dear, don't cry.

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:04.136
[MERCHILD A]
Daddy!

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.205
[FISHMAN E]
Over here! He needs help!

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:08.808
Dammit, Hordy! These
people weren't even armed!

00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:11.477
How the hell could
you do this to them?

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.511
Huh?

00:15:12.545 --> 00:15:15.448
Her Majesty, is she safe now?

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:19.185
I've got no idea. I wish I did.

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:21.887
But wherever she is,
I'm sure she's fighting for us!

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:26.058
Madam Sharley, what's gonna
happen to Fishman Island?

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.227
Are we gonna die?

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.629
What about the guy
with the straw hat?

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:34.066
Is he gonna come back
here and save us?

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.770
I'm scared, Madam Sharley!
Say something!

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:40.406
We should pray.

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:41.374
[FISHBOY A]
Huh?

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:44.477
All we can do is pray
Princess Shirahoshi

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.645
and the others are safe.

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:49.215
We're helpless.

00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:53.719
If we lose them, then we've
lost all hope of survival.

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:29.922
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Higher! Higher!

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:34.260
Heh. So desperate.

00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:39.331
[SHIRAHOSHI] Stay away from
the island, Noah! Please!

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:40.800
Shirahoshi!

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:44.970
If the Noah falls now,
it's all over!

00:16:47.473 --> 00:16:48.908
No! She can't hear!

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:51.177
Stop swimming upward!

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:56.215
Sister! You have to change your
course before it's too late!

00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:57.783
[HORDY]
They figured it out.

00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:01.287
Shirahoshi!

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.022
[HORDY]
Shark Slicer!

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:06.392
Huh? Ah!

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:07.526
Brother, no!

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.495
Ryuboshi!

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:12.932
The plan is set.
Do not interfere.

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:15.634
Hey! Hey! Hold on!

00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:18.637
If Decken dies, his ability
will stop working.

00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:21.307
You see, I stabbed him so
that the Noah would fall.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.408
[gasps]

00:17:23.943 --> 00:17:25.911
So that's it!

00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:27.847
If she keeps swimming
straight up,

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.383
the ship's just gonna crash
right into the island!

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:33.385
No matter how far
away she swims,

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:35.621
the problem's just
gonna get worse!

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:38.691
After her! We gotta go
tell her what to do!

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.993
Right!

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:43.395
Shirahoshi!

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:45.931
Weepyhoshi!

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:51.203
[HORDY]
Stop right there.

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:52.738
I won't let you ruin this.

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:55.040
It's far too convenient for me.

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:57.009
Without even raising a finger,

00:17:57.042 --> 00:17:59.411
I can crush my enemies
in one shot.

00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:01.881
Including your meddlesome crew.

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:04.116
Stay with me!

00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:09.455
Shirahoshi! You've
gotta swim to the side!

00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:12.157
Sister!

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:14.627
[gasps]

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:27.640
She-She heard you!

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:29.441
[LUFFY]
Yes.

00:18:29.475 --> 00:18:31.010
[HORDY]
Huh?

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:34.413
Useless mermaid!
This isn't over!

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.181
She's pulling away
from the island!

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:37.917
And just in time, too!

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.985
You're getting on my nerves.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.389
I'll make you pay for that!

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:45.624
I don't think so!

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:49.128
[HORDY]
Hm?

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:51.096
Ugh! You brat!

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.599
You're not gonna
hurt Weepyhoshi!

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:55.768
Tch. Watch me.

00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:02.808
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Noah, please follow me!

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.477
I can't hold him.

00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:08.614
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Just a little farther! This way!

00:19:11.216 --> 00:19:13.252
Let's go!

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:16.956
Vander Decken would you just
hurry up and die already?

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:23.862
[DECKEN]
Hordy, I'll get my revenge.

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:26.098
Whatever it takes.

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:36.275
[SHIRAHOSHI] If I stop,
they'll all be killed!

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:41.914
[FUKABOSHI] The ship. It's
starting to move to the side!

00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:44.550
Yeah, you're doing great!
Almost there!

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:45.818
Keep swimming!

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.686
Hurry!

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:56.762
My left hand touched you, so...

00:19:56.795 --> 00:20:00.933
...you're going to
be my final target.

00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:04.169
I'll run you into the ground.

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:08.007
I will chase you to
the gates of hell!

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:11.010
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Noah!

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:14.079
[FUKABOSHI] You mustn't
give up now, Shirahoshi!

00:20:14.113 --> 00:20:17.082
If it misses the island,
then this was all for nothing!

00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:20.653
[DECKEN] Even if I die,
you can't escape!

00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:23.155
[FUKABOSHI]
Stay back!

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:28.427
[MANBOSHI]
Hordy!

00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:34.033
[gasps]

00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:42.508
You're almost there. Don't stop!

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:43.609
Decken.

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:47.713
It's over. You've lost!

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:49.748
If you won't move,
I'll move you!

00:20:49.782 --> 00:20:51.617
Yeah?! Bring it on!

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:56.822
My axe will end this
once and for all!

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:58.891
[HORDY]
Shark Slicer!

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:04.563
I'll protect everyone!

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:35.194
[yelling]

00:22:23.142 --> 00:22:24.977
[ALL gasp]

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:33.051
We were too late! It's falling!

00:22:41.627 --> 00:22:43.128
It's right on target, too.

00:22:43.162 --> 00:22:44.797
[yelling]

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.765
[BOTH yell]

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:48.700
They're all going to die!

00:22:48.734 --> 00:22:51.303
Is there nothing we can do?

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:53.105
[gasps] It can't be!

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:56.175
Now this island will
ring in a new era!

00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:58.343
[growling]

00:22:58.377 --> 00:23:04.383
[HORDY laughing]

00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:14.927
[NARRATOR] Luffy tries to lure
Hordy to the deck of the Noah,

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.529
but his plan is thwarted when
the Fishman destroys the bubble

00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:19.598
maintaining oxygen on the ship.

00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:21.800
Fukaboshi faces off
with Hordy himself,

00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:24.002
but cannot match the
strength of his foe.

00:23:24.036 --> 00:23:26.271
As Hordy reaches a new
level of strength,

00:23:26.305 --> 00:23:29.708
Luffy must place his faith
in a life-or-death gamble.

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:31.743
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:35.814
"Luffy Loses the Fight?!
Hordy's Long-Awaited Revenge!"

00:23:35.848 --> 00:23:38.217
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
