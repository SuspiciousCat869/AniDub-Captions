1
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,719
We're almost to the exit now.

2
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,355
Full speed ahead until
we fly outta here!

3
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,690
What?

4
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:23,490
No way!

5
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,325
You're kidding, right?!

6
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:28,629
All right!

7
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:29,196
There it is!

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,297
Time to move out, men!

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,335
Let's charge ahead, join them,
and get Franky back!

10
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,404
Yeah!!!

11
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,106
Sodom! Gomorrah! Jump!

12
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,779
Straw Hat!

13
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:49,450
The entire Franky Family
thanks you for helping us!

14
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:53,420
We'll never forget it!

15
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,063
Cool!

16
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,431
Hey, nice job!

17
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,267
Pretty high-grade bulls
you've got there!

18
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,473
But no matter what I said
or did, I couldn't stop you.

19
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,475
And the enemy that you'd
go through all of this

20
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,311
to rescue your friend
from is the exact same one

21
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,713
that tried to kill Iceberg.

22
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,315
I've got a word or two of my own

23
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,384
I wanna say to those bastards!

24
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,451
Right.

25
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:28,155
So even though we got in
a few fights back in town

26
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,356
with both the Franky Family

27
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,692
and with the
Galley-La shipwrights,

28
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:35,295
the enemy we're all going
after here is one and the same.

29
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:37,765
Oh, no!

30
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,700
Rocketman can't be controlled.

31
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:43,304
My job ended as soon as
I got us up on the railway.

32
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:46,373
There's nothing anybody
can do to stop it.

33
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,741
This train's gonna--!

34
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,446
Everybody on this train
has the exact same goal.

35
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,348
There's no point in
fighting separately.

36
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,187
From this point forward,
we fight as one!

37
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,154
Listen up!

38
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,591
We're not gonna let
that big wave beat us!

39
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,759
We will achieve our goal!

40
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,795
Let's go!

41
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,064
Yeah!

42
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,868
All right boys,

43
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,604
why don't you show me what
you can do about that wave!

44
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,438
You got it!

45
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,572
Fire all cannons!

46
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,741
Blow it to bits!

47
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,210
Cannons are my specialty!

48
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,411
It's just water!

49
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,380
Don't be afraid, bros!

50
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:27,681
Prepare the cannons!

51
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,449
Roger!

52
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,452
Get a move on!

53
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,765
Puru-puru. Puru-puru.

54
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:48,168
Ah! The Transponder
snail's ringing!

55
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,037
Hey guys, it's from Sanji!

56
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,049
Wh-What's going on here?

57
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,353
Oh, no!

58
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,521
Not him, too!

59
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,123
It was the same
thing in the last car!

60
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,505
Hey, you there.

61
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,175
Yes, Captain T-Bone!

62
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,244
How did you get that
injury on your arm?

63
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:44,645
Huh?

64
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,913
This?

65
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:49,416
I got bitten by a bug earlier
and it bled when I scratched it.

66
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,751
How awful!

67
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,386
We must staunch the bleeding!

68
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,823
We'll have to make do with this.

69
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,392
Sir! You don't have to tear
your cape just for me!

70
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,463
It may be your
arm that's bleeding,

71
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,231
but when one of
my men is injured,

72
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,734
it's my heart that
hurts the most.

73
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:07,668
Captain!

74
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,735
Thank you!

75
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:13,707
Let us fill today and every
day forth with good deeds,

76
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,643
so that peace and
kindness shall reign.

77
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,748
His face is still really scary.

78
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,417
Captain!

79
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,586
I'll help!

80
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:29,123
Oh good, but let me
explain the problem first.

81
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,091
If there's anything I can do.

82
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:34,761
Even if it kills me
I will protect you!

83
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,364
Uh, thanks.

84
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,701
But the problem is with the
officials in car 6 and 7.

85
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,603
They were completely wiped out!

86
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:47,174
Not only that, the two criminals
detained in car 6 are missing.

87
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,143
That's awful!

88
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,712
We can't tell if the prisoners
escaped on their own,

89
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,248
of if they were helped
by an unknown intruder.

90
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,717
For heaven's sake, man,
start a rescue operation!

91
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,253
Help the injured and spread
the word to the other cars!

92
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,787
Yes, sir!

93
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:02,489
Nami!

94
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,724
Nami, can you hear me?

95
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,291
Yeah!

96
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:05,693
What's going on, Sanji?

97
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,461
I've got some bad news.

98
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,597
Things have gotten complicated.

99
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,064
What do you mean?

100
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,668
Hey, wait a sec
what was that noise?

101
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,637
Is someone there
with you or something?

102
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,243
It's nothing just some dumb ass.

103
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,345
Huh? Say what?

104
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:24,879
Sanji!

105
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,614
What's that noise?!

106
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:27,448
It sounds like a bunch

107
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,383
of screaming-are you
okay over there?

108
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,118
What d'you mean by "dumb ass"?

109
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,120
Sorry, dumb asses, actually.

110
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,426
Demi Cannon!

111
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,434
Leave it to us!

112
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,069
Not even making a dent.

113
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,471
I shoulda figured.

114
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:53,073
You think those puny
things are gonna work?

115
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,174
Everybody, step back!

116
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:59,145
Let the Franky Family's
Special Cannon do its stuff!

117
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,053
Target Aqua Laguna!

118
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,154
Go!

119
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,456
Super Scrap Cannon, fire!

120
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,501
Fire again!

121
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,068
Don't let up!

122
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,610
Bring more cannonballs!

123
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:30,110
Got it!

124
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:31,111
Aim at the center!

125
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,446
Focus on one spot!

126
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,015
Focus pocus,
give it all you got!

127
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,418
Yeah, good luck with that.

128
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:39,353
By the way, the
tracks do rise up a bit

129
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,489
but not enough to
get us over that wave.

130
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,192
Rocket Man has done
pretty well out here so far.

131
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,527
But if we get hit,
we're finished.

132
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,363
Does that mean
we're all gonna die?!

133
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,399
No guarantees!

134
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,035
I warned you, now didn't I?

135
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,105
What?!

136
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,439
I don't wanna die!

137
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:02,676
I see.

138
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,344
They still have Robin.

139
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,483
It sounds like things are
pretty lively on your end, too.

140
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,219
Hey listen, Sanji.

141
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,588
I need to tell you why
Robin's doing all this.

142
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:18,258
And also why everyone's
screaming, for that matter.

143
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:22,429
Shut up!

144
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,465
So, like I was just saying.

145
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,433
We found out why
Robin's with CP9.

146
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,635
We're out here
trying to follow her,

147
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,037
but things are kind
of crazy right now.

148
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,338
It's a long story.

149
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,742
We're all gonna die!

150
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,410
But I don't wanna die!

151
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,245
Me either!

152
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,681
If you have time
to cry, keep firing!

153
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,649
We'll find a way out!

154
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,054
Hey, Luffy.

155
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:47,788
Yeah.

156
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,423
I know what you're thinking.

157
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,158
That wave's asking for it, huh?

158
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,035
C'mon!

159
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,470
Keep those cannon's firing!

160
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,539
What're you guys
planning on doing?

161
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,349
Same thing as you.

162
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,586
Watch.

163
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:31,197
Hey, how much is a
hundred and eight times two?

164
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,568
Two hundred and sixteen.

165
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,370
Two hundred sixteen, huh?

166
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,304
That's too long.

167
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,073
Can't we round up or something?

168
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:42,409
Fine make it 300, then.

169
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,278
I don't get it. What do they
think they're doing?

170
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,047
If cannons don't work, what
good are swords are gonna do?

171
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,383
Well, they did say we
should keep fighting, though.

172
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,218
Stop yapping and back them up!

173
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,386
Roger!

174
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,223
Okay!

175
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,258
Ready?

176
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,759
Uh-huh.

177
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,228
Now Gum-Gum--

178
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,697
Three Hundred Caliber--

179
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:15,342
We're gonna crash!

180
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,444
Cannon!

181
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,230
Roger!

182
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:38,766
Okay!

183
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,700
Ready?

184
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,136
Uh-huh.

185
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,038
Now Gum-Gum--

186
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,439
Three Hundred Caliber--

187
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,411
We're gonna crash!

188
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:00,020
Cannon!

189
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,740
Sanji--

190
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,053
It's all or nothing!

191
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:49,796
We... We made it!

192
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,641
Take that, Aqua Laguna!

193
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,115
I thought we were gonna die!

194
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,608
Hey! Hey, Nami are you okay?

195
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:38,044
Yeah, I-I think so.

196
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,514
We survived after all, huh?

197
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,449
You pirates know how to party!

198
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,485
Keep up the good work!

199
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:46,654
They're even stronger
than Aqua Laguna!

200
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:49,089
If we were enemies,
I'd be scared right now,

201
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,225
but since we're
friends, I'm happy!

202
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,593
Go Straw Hat!

203
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,229
We'd all be dead right
now if not for them.

204
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,730
Lucky that little trick worked.

205
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,700
Let's not get ahead of
ourselves, everybody!

206
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,702
We're not through the storm yet!

207
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,771
Yes, ma'am!

208
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:06,339
I'm not afraid of
anything, anymore!

209
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:12,546
Wow, that was really fun!

210
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,215
I knew you were strong,
but that was something else!

211
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,450
Are you an alien or something,

212
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,386
'cause that was totally
out of this world!

213
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:21,322
Oops.

214
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:23,057
Sorry 'bout that.

215
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,224
Luffy, c'mere a sec.

216
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,425
Huh?

217
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,100
Sanji wants to talk.

218
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,240
That you, Luffy?

219
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,442
Yep, it's me!

220
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:42,476
What's up?

221
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,078
You save Robin?

222
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,813
No, sorry.

223
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:47,648
Afraid I'm still
working on that one.

224
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,617
Nami just told me
why Robin surrendered

225
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,385
and all of that stuff.

226
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:57,091
So yeah I know what's going on.

227
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,692
I see.

228
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,327
That's good.

229
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,064
Well anyway,
you know what's next.

230
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,600
Go ahead. Give 'em hell, Sanji.

231
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,068
Huh?

232
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:09,803
Hold on!

233
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,772
He'll die if he fights them now!

234
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,642
If wants to stand a chance,
he's gotta wait on us!

235
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:17,077
Hey, Cook, can you hear me?

236
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,178
Some of the guys on that train

237
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,680
are really tough,
you shouldn't--

238
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:20,547
Zoro!

239
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,015
It's fine.

240
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:29,490
If it was you, would you wait?

241
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:31,725
If you were on that train
right now instead of him and

242
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:35,696
I told you that Robin sacrificed
herself to protect us.

243
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,431
Would you just sit
there and do nothing?

244
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:43,704
No use trying to stop him.

245
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,472
Read me like a book.

246
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,041
But thanks, Moss Head.

247
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:49,510
I never knew that you
cared about me so much.

248
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:51,145
I hope they kill you!

249
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,247
Anyway, that settles it.

250
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,351
I was willing to fight for Robin
even before I knew the truth.

251
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:00,521
But now that you told
me how she really feels.

252
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:04,425
I wouldn't stop,
even if you begged me.

253
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,794
Why'd you break
it, you bastard?!

254
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:09,530
I wanted to talk to
Straw Hat, too, damn it!

255
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:11,165
Huh?

256
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,766
Deal with it.

257
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,602
No point in griping at me now.

258
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:16,103
What, was I supposed
to interrupt you

259
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,338
while you were talking?

260
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,439
That's just rude!

261
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:21,474
You're rude anyway.

262
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,679
I hope he's okay on his own.

263
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:26,313
Granny, hurry!

264
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,215
Make the train go faster!

265
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,483
Faster?

266
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:30,551
Yeah!

267
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:34,221
More like zoom, y'know?

268
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,057
Oh, don't you worry!

269
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,493
This baby is already
going way faster

270
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:42,028
than it was ever supposed to!

271
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:45,399
In fact, we're going so fast,

272
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,534
we can't even stop anymore!

273
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:59,079
So much stuff has
happened since I left.

274
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,582
It almost doesn't seem real.

275
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:04,351
In a way, Robin's in
the same boat you are.

276
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,719
Never found out
about what happened

277
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:09,789
with the Merry or
your fight with Luffy.

278
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,728
It makes me ashamed to think it

279
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,831
but while we were busy
fighting amongst ourselves.

280
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,067
Robin surrendered to the
government

281
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,570
so the six of us could be safe.

282
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,671
That includes you.

283
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:27,775
Oh, man!

284
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:30,644
That's such a sad story!

285
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,649
Why are you crying?

286
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,251
I'm not crying, you are!

287
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:41,622
Damn it!

288
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:42,623
Now I'm all torn up!

289
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:45,225
I always thought Robin
was some evil monster,

290
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,461
but it turns out
she's got a soft side!

291
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:50,064
What if I'm confused
about other stuff, too?!

292
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:53,434
How am I supposed to go on?

293
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,036
I'm not gonna stand here in
the rain when Robin's so close.

294
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,572
I gotta save her
before it's too late.

295
00:18:58,605 --> 00:18:59,673
Sweet.

296
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,243
Once again, I'm Franky,
leader of the Franky Family.

297
00:19:02,276 --> 00:19:04,612
You 'n me'll make a
good team, Eyebrows Bro.

298
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:05,746
I won't go into the details,

299
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,182
but I've got a pretty good
reason to keep Robin away

300
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,117
from those
government chumps, too!

301
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,652
Besides, you really
touched my heart

302
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:13,287
with that story of yours.

303
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,056
Hey, Long-Nose,
let's do this thing!

304
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:22,095
No, I'm... I'm not coming.

305
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:27,268
This doesn't have anything
to do with me anymore.

306
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:29,236
You're about to make
yourselves personal enemies

307
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,571
of the World Government.

308
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:33,240
I don't want to
be any part of that.

309
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:37,211
Besides, Luffy and the
rest of the crew are coming.

310
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,813
After I humiliated
myself in front of them.

311
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,715
I just can't pretend like
nothing ever happened

312
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,483
and laugh it off.

313
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:49,790
I still feel bad for
Robin but I'm sorry.

314
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:52,192
It's not my job to save her now.

315
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,728
I am not a part of Luffy's crew!

316
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,035
See ya.

317
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:06,140
"See ya?" There's
no place to go!

318
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:06,941
Come on!

319
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:09,410
You guys can
talk this over, bro!

320
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:11,512
Forget it.

321
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,714
Just leave him.

322
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:18,251
You are both stubborn as hell.

323
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,488
Check every corner!

324
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,590
They gotta be here somewhere!

325
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,225
What?!

326
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:28,362
This is just terrible!

327
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:31,031
We'll have to make do with this.

328
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:33,701
The train's in a lot
of trouble right now!

329
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:34,468
Wanze!

330
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:35,536
We need your help!

331
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,371
Shut up, stupid!

332
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,339
Your face is in trouble!

333
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:44,578
Nero! The criminals
made an escape!

334
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:45,745
Hm?

335
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:49,649
How's it going over there?

336
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,752
Have you noticed
anything strange?

337
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:53,487
No. Nothing yet at least.

338
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,255
Keep looking!

339
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:55,288
Sir!

340
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,539
They're right here!

341
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,141
Dammit, they found us!

342
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:15,742
Metallic Star!

343
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,784
Who the hell are you?!

344
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:33,761
Your friend told me everything.

345
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:34,595
I understand that you are here

346
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:37,331
to rescue a certain
mademoiselle.

347
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:40,767
That alone is reason enough
for me to join your cause.

348
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:44,504
My weapons are at your disposal.

349
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:54,347
My name is Sniper King.

350
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:16,130
We'll now begin
Operation Rescue Robin!

351
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:19,099
Wait Sanji, don't you want
to learn more about me first?

352
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:21,468
Before anything else, we gotta
clear out the enemy forces.

353
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,404
Like my origin story
or super moves?

354
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:25,439
We'll start with the weak
guys, then work our way up.

355
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:27,474
Sniper King,
I'll-Do-My-Best Star!

356
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:29,376
Hey, would you shut up
and listen to me?

357
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,477
Yes, sir. Sorry.

358
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,681
On the next One Piece:
"A Mysterious Man Appears?!

359
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:35,549
His Name Is Sniper King!"

360
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,218
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
