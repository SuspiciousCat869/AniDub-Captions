00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,690
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,426
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,995
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,998
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,532
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,335
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,004
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,940
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,809
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,444
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,979
of the World Government,

12
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,115
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,586
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:09,123
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:12,293
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:16,963
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,236
[NARRATOR] Separated
from the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,538
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

19
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,307
to rescue his brother, Ace.

20
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,043
Thanks to a final charge
from Whitebeard's associates,

21
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,946
success seemed to be
within Luffy's grasp.

22
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,382
But then, the unthinkable
happened and Admiral Akainu

23
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:39,253
landed a fatal blow
against Luffy's brother.

24
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,520
[ACE]
Pops...

25
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,124
[ACE]
...my family...

26
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,794
[ACE]
...and you, Luffy...

27
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,265
[ACE]
Thank you...

28
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,535
...for caring about
someone like me,

29
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,937
who's good for nothing,

30
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,707
who this world never wanted,

31
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,310
who has such bad
blood in his veins.

32
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,985
[ACE]
Thank you...

33
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,427
...for loving me.

34

[LUFFY]
Ace...

38
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:05,505
[crying]

39
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:35,369
[ACE] You didn't really
think I was dead, did you?

40
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:40,407
[LUFFY crying]

41
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,077
Uh-huh.

42
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,478
Yeah, well I'm not!

43
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,114
So stop your crying and
have some faith for once!

[LUFFY crying]

45
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,092
[ACE] I promise, I'm not
gonna die, okay? Not ever!

46
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,561
At least not as long as
I've got a wussy little brother

47
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:03,063
who needs me to protect him.

48
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,846
[GOLD ROGER] Garp, please,
look after my child.

50
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:24,117
Our son's name is Gol D. Ace.

51
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,097
[ACE]
It's the truth!

52
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,566
All it takes to become brothers

53
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,902
is to share some saké!

54
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,672
All right, from here on out...

55
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,580
[ACE] ...we're honest
to goodness brothers!

56
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,836
But we were so close.

I won't miss twice.

Wake up! Luffy!

85
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,954
We have to run!

then as his family,
we have to step up!

98
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,927
Ace... is our brother!

99
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,498

184
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,686
All we can do is
honor his wishes!

185
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,821
As his sons,
we should be grateful

186
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,323
and hold our heads up high!

187
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,725
Save your tears
for later. Let's move!

188
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,194
I'm done! I can't!

189
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,729
Stand up!

190
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,734
[PIRATE DD]
If a ship can sail,

191
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:04,004
bring it to the
bay head and line 'em up!

192
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,106
[MARINE BB] We can still
shoot you, damn it!

193
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:09,510
Stop wasting time!

194
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,879
[WHITEBEARD grunts]

195
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:14,248
[JIMBEI grunting]

196
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:17,885
Salome! Take me to Luffy.
I fear for his safety!

197
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:19,119
[SALOME hisses]

198
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:20,921
[MARINES yell]

199
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,558
[MARCO]
Sorry for disobeying orders,

200
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:27,227
but someone's gotta watch
this to the end, Pops.

201
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,598
[yelling]

202
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:37,137
[MARINES scream]

203
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:42,542
[WHITEBEARD grunting]

204
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,251
[yells]

205
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:11,705
[WHITEBEARD panting]

206
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:15,276
[chuckles]

207
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,277
Hey, look!

208
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,845
What the hell is that?

209
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:19,480
[MARINES gasping]

210
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:22,449
[MARINE CC] It's huge! Whatever
it is, it's can't be good!

211
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:25,286
Oops. They found me.

212
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,654
There's someone else, too!

213
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:30,090
There's a whole group of
people up on the scaffold!

214
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:33,727
[BLACKBEARD] You fellas ain't
very observant, are you?

215
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,996
[BLACKBEARD chuckles]

216
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,665
Blackbeard!

217
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:40,100
It seems you've
made some new friends.

218
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:44,004
[MARINE DD] I thought they
were locked up in Impel Down!

219
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:48,542
[WHITEBEARD grunts]
Teach.

220
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:49,910
[BLACKBEARD chuckles]

221
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:52,246
[MARINE EE] They were supposed
to be erased from history!

222
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,914
After the crimes they committed,

223
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:56,550
even death was
too great a mercy!

224
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,085
[WOLF gasps]

225
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:01,155

living creature in the world.

226
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:04,992
The "Great Battleship,"
San Juan Wolf.

227
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:10,130
Wow. They even know
my name. Well, I'll be!

228
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,233
[MARINE FF] The "Corrupt King,"
Avalo Pizzaro!

229
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:16,604
Meow, I'm back. Meow, you die!

230
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:19,639
[MARINE FF]
"Heavy Drinker," Vasco Shot!

231
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:26,313
[laughing, hiccups]

232
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,116
I'm gonna go ahead
and kill 'em all, 'kay?

233
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:32,152
[MARINE FF] "Crescent Moon
Hunter," Catarina Devon!

234
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,121
[laughs]

235
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:37,424
You boys want this? Try me!

236
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:40,694
[MARINE FF] And that's the old
jail manager from Impel Down,

237
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,495
Shiryu of the Rain!

238
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:46,033
[MARINE FF] They've joined
the Blackbeard Pirates!

239
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:51,505
[BLACKBEARD laughing]

240
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,374
Hey there, Pops!

241
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:56,877
I'm glad I could
make it to your funeral!

242
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,612
Ya miss me?

243
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:01,915
[WHITEBEARD]
You fat bastard!

244
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:11,258
[NARRATOR]
Blackbeard appears!

245
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,727
His murder of Thatch
and his capture of Ace,

246
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,997
all part of a terrifying plan
that no one could've imagined.

247
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,733
With the war with Marineford
in it's final stage,

248
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,069
Whitebeard fights to
avenge his fallen sons,

249
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:24,939
and punish the traitor who
has plotted his undoing.

250
00:23:24,972 --> 00:23:26,707
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

251
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,644
"Ending the Matter! Whitebeard
vs. the Blackbead Pirates!"

252
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:32,913
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
