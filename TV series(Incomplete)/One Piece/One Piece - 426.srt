178
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,153
[FRANKY]
But I'm so super!

179
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,197
[LUFFY]
I got this one, guys!

180
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,408
[LUFFY grunts]

181
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,663
Hey beetle! Bring it on!

182
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,377
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

183
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,014
[LUFFY yells]

184
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,141
[LUFFY]
Bazooka!

185
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,399
He knocked Boss away!
That's crazy!

186
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:39,031
[BOSS groaning]

187
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,450
Not only is it gigantic,
but it breathes fire.

188
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,954
Damn. That thing's gonna
roast our ship to a crisp!

189
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:48,040
Luffy! Are you okay up there?

190
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,375
[LUFFY]
It's super big.

191
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,876
Super strong.

192
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,504
And it breathes fire.

193
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,048
It's the coolest thing ever!

194
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,758
[CHOPPER]
Uh...

195
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,428
Yeah, I get the
feeling he's okay.

196
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,846
[LUFFY]
I got a plan!

197
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,014
I'm gonna make him
join our crew!

198
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,767
[ALL]
Wait, what? Hang on, Luffy!

199
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,813
[LUFFY giggles] Alright,
big guy. You're gonna join--

200
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,440
[LUFFY yelps]

201
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,943
[LUFFY yells]

202
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,950
[LUFFY giggles]
Yeah, I got ya now!

203
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,910
[YOKO]
This can't be happening.

204
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:28,998
[LUFFY laughing]

205
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,751
[USOPP] Looks like they're
headed back this way.

206
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,043
[BROOK]
Indeed.

207
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,005
[USOPP] In fact, it looks like
they're headed straight for us!

208
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,007
Make a run for it!

209
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:46,390
[USOPP slow motion]
Help! Help!

210
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,184
[USOPP]
Help me!

211
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:48,976
[SANJI]
Really, Usopp?

212
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,479
[ZORO]
Oh, c'mon, you damn idiot.

213
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,064
[SANJI, ZORO grunt]

214
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,317
[USOPP whimpering]

215
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,778
[NAMI]
Huh?

216
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,450
[NAMI]
And now it's flying away.

217
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,412
[NAMI]
What's wrong with those morons?

218
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,501
[NAMI] Hey, there's an
island over there.

219
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,837
I'm guessing that's where
the beetle came from.

220
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,132
[YOKO]
Uh-oh!

221
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,550
Watch out, Boss! Pull up!

222
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,594
[USOPP screams]
We're gonna hit the wall!

223
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,388
[BOSS groaning]
[LUFFY grunting]

224
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,349
[LUFFY screams]

225
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:53,165
[LUFFY laughing]
Good luck gettin' away now,

226
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,917
ya giant beetle!

227
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,545
So, you gonna join
my crew or what?

228
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,005
I'd say yes if I were you.

229
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,132
[LUFFY laughs]

230
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,509
[YOKO]
Boss is with me!

231
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,552
Huh?

232
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:09,139
[YOKO] And he'd rather
die than become a pirate!

233
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,850
[YOKO growling]

234
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:19,900
[LUFFY screaming]

235
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,528
[USOPP, SANJI, ZORO groan]

236
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,155
Okay, so now what?

237
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,616
I didn't even know there
was an island out here.

238
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,912
[USOPP pants]
Y'know what I wanna know?

239
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,664
[GROUP]
What the hell are they doing?

240
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,540
[VILLAGERS panting]

241
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,167
[YELLOW VEST GUY]
Yoko! What's wrong?

242
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,588
[YOKO] Be careful, stay back!
This guy's a pirate!

243
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,924
[VILLAGERS]
Wait, he's a pirate?

244
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,260
Have mercy on us!

245
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,098
[YOKO] Stop fighting back,
you pirate scum!

246
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,018
[FABRE]
Hm? If I'm not mistaken,

247
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,229
you folks are from the
Straw Hat Pirates, aren't you?

248
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,230
[ISLANDERS]
Huh?

249
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,566
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's us.

250
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,236
Oh, man, you're right!
I thought I recognized them!

251
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,573
[BLUE SHIRT GUY] Yeah!
That guy's "Pirate Hunter" Zoro!

252
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,908
[PINK SHIRT GUY]
And him!

253
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,076
That's the infamous
"Black Leg" Sanji!

254
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,995
[GREEN SHIRT GUY]
And is that...

255
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,496
[ISLANDERS]
Wait, who is that guy?

256
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,706
Oh, c'mon!

257
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,624
[YOKO]
Lemme go!

258
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,418
That jerk tried to
take Boss away from me!

259
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,670
I'll bite him to death!

260
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,755
[YELLOW VEST GUY]
Yoko! Calm down!

261
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,091
[YOKO] You calm down!
Shut up and let me at him!

262
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,386
Who in the hell
are these people?

263
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,429
That really hurt!

264
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,265
C'mon! I didn't know you
were that beetle's owner!

265
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:37,061
What owner? He's my friend!
Nobody owns Boss!

266
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,396
Your friend? Really?

267
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,066
You're already on someone
else's team, then?

268
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,568
Don't you think he'd be
better off on a real crew?

269
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,278
[YOKO grunts]
No he wouldn't!

270
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,948
Because Boss and I
are inseparable!

271
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,081
Okay. Can't argue with that.

272
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,207
Huh?

273
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,126
[LUFFY grunts]

274
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,464
[LUFFY]
Here we goo.

275
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,466
Hey! What're you doing to him?

276
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:14,181
[LUFFY grunting, yelling]

277
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,352
[LUFFY yells]

278
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,311
He's free!

279
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,647
[BOSS groans]

280
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,525
[LUFFY]
Sorry if I hurt you, big guy.

281
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,152
You don't think you could
hurt Boss, do you?

282
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,238
[LUFFY] What? I didn't
mean it like that.

283
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,657
[BOSS roars]

284
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,533
[YOKO]
Hey, are you okay?

285
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,576
[LUFFY] Hey, is--
[YOKO] Stay back!

286
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,663
These wounds are nothin' more
than a few scratches to Boss!

287
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,290
They'll all heal up while he's
sleeping underground tonight!

288
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,335
Wow! That's pretty badass!

289
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,045
[YOKO]
Oh, yeah, you think that's cool?

290
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,256
Well, he's gonna
molt tomorrow, too!

291
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,758
He'll get even bigger and
stronger than he is now!

292
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,469
Huh? I didn't think
Beetles kept on molting

293
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,637
after they were fully grown.

294
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,597
[FABRE]
Boss isn't an ordinary beetle.

295
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,226
He sheds his skin once a month
no matter how large he gets.

296
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,187
So as big as he is,
he's only gonna get bigger.

297
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,648
He's gonna be even
stronger than he is now?

298
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,359
Sure is! What, do you
wanna fight about it?

299
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,361
Yeah! That's cool!

300
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,698
Listen, I'll come back
tomorrow and we'll try again!

301
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,533
Uh--

302
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,743
[LUFFY]
Then we'll know for sure

303
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,579
which one of us
is the strongest!

304
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,247
But that's just ridiculous.

305
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:25,461
[BOSS groaning]

306
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,379
Huh?

307
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,715
[LUFFY laughs]
Alright.

308
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,092
You better not
chicken out on me, then!

309
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,304
[BOSS roars]

310
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,223
[FABRE laughs]
If nothing else,

311
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,560
the boy sure is
spirited, isn't he?

312
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,312
Boss?

313
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,113
[FABRE]
Watch your step!

314
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:57,076
Wow! This cave is so cavernous!

315
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,202
[USOPP]
What's it used for?

316
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,579
[WHITE SHIRT GUY] Oh, this?
It's an escape route.

317
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,747
[USOPP]
From what?

318
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,916
[WHITE SHIRT GUY] This cave
is like a massive labyrinth

319
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,209
if you don't know
your way around.

320
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,586
So it's the perfect strategy for
outrunning marauding pirates.

321
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,254
[PONYTAIL GUY]
You'd be hard pressed to find

322
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,673
anyone more adept at
running away than we are.

323
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,383
And that's something
you're proud of?

324
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,094
[FABRE] That's the only
way we can survive

325
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,180
on the Grand Line.
We don't have a military.

326
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,974
And the island is so remote
that the Navy basically

327
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,353
treats us like we don't even
exist, so we're on our own.

328
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,021
Hey, speaking of the Navy.

329
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,316
I noticed that girl was
dressed up like a marine.

330
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,694
[SANJI]
What's all that about?

331
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,073
[FABRE]
She wears that hat and coat,

332
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,034
in memory of her father.

333
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,370
[FABRE] That man was
as good as they come.

334
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:45,124
He refused to look the other way
while we kept getting attacked.

335
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,626
So he left his battalion
and stayed on our island

336
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,586
in order to protect us.

337
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,589
[SANJI] And when you
said, "In memory of"?

338
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,384
[FABRE]
It happened five long years ago.

339
00:18:55,425 --> 00:19:00,180
The poor, brave man took on a
group of pirates all by himself.

340
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,307
And he was killed.

341
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,476
And then, three years later.

342
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:09,106
Boss appeared out of nowhere
as if this was his home.

343
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,233
Yoko was the first to find him.

344
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,193
They bonded right away.

345
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,488
And he quickly became the
guardian angel of our island.

346
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,408
Truth be told, I get the
impression that Boss's strength

347
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:23,495
and bravery remind poor
little Yoko of her father.

348
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,165
Are you sure it's alright
for us to be here?

349
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,291
We are pirates.

350
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,293
A different class of pirate.

351
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,503
Now. Here we are.

352
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,464
[LUFFY laughing]

353
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,552
[LUFFY]
Wow! A windmill! It's huge!

354
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,017
[LUFFY laughing]

355
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,188
[LUFFY]
We're so high up!

356
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,402
[USOPP]
Whoa.

357
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,446
I thought we were just
gonna get more rocks

358
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,364
but it's actually
beautiful back here.

359
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,283
Well, then again...

360
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,535
[USOPP] Not to be rude,
but there's not much

361
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,455
of an architectural
uniformity here.

362
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,540
It's interesting though.

363
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,752
[FABRE laughs]
You don't recognize the theme?

364
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,087
It was a deserted island
when we came here,

365
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,797
so we worked hard to
make all the buildings

366
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,549
look just like they do.

367
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,718
The strange thing is that
everyone who's landed here

368
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,595
since has come from
the same ocean.

369
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,224
So our town is like
a microcosm, in a way.

370
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,559
So we'd like to
welcome you, Straw Hats.

371
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,519
To Kansorn Island.

372
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,398
Home away from home for
expatriates of the East Blue!

373
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,193
[FABRE] We like to
call it Little East Blue!

374
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,237
[VILLAGERS cheer]

375
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,697
Wow! I never dreamed
we'd have the East Blue's

376
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,741
most famous rookies
show up on our shore!

377
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,076
[RANDOM VILLAGER 426D]
Hey, Zoro!

378
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,160
You're from
Frost Moon Village, right?

379
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,537
We've got a dojo just like
the one you trained in!

380
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,081
You should come
and check it out!

381
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,249
[ZORO]
Really?

382
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,833
[RANDOM VILLAGER 426E]
And you grew up on the Baratie,

383
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,085
right, Sanji?

384
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,504
We'd love to hear what you think
of the food at our Baratie.

385
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,296
It's pretty good!

386
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,839
There's a Baratie here?

387
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,300
[USOPP]
Anyone here from Syrup Village?

388
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,260
[YELLOW SHIRT GUY]
Let's see.

389
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,303
I think Luigia might
be from there, actually.

390
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,429
Luigia?

391
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,597
[YELLOW SHIRT GUY]
Yeah, that's right.

392
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,599
She lives in the
biggest mansion in town.

393
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,769
A mansion? But the only
mansion in Syrup Village

394
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,854
is the one Kaya lives in.

395
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,402
Ugh. Everybody thinks
they're so great.

396
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,821
But no shifty pirate's
gonna trick me!

397
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,240
I swear it.

398
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,535
It's been a while.
Do you think they're okay?

399
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,453
[NAMI]
Don't get so worked up, Chopper.

400
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,455
I'm sure they'll call us soon.

401
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,540
[CHOPPER]
Yeah, I hope so.

402
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,917
You might wanna think about
building an insect cage

403
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,794
for when they return, Franky.

404
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,087
Hey, good idea.

405
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,756
I guess we're gonna need one if
that thing's our new shipmate.

406
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,758

You see?

[USOPP] It's me, Usopp,
I need to talk to Nami!

Hey, Usopp. It's Nami.

What's going on?
Did you guys catch it okay?

411
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,476
[USOPP]
No no no, forget about that.

Will you shut up, calm down!

413
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,316
I can't hear her!
Look, how quickly do you think

414
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,151
you could get over
to where we are?

415
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,444
Huh?

416
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,488
[USOPP] There's a town right on
the other side of the island.

Take it easy, guys.

419
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,744
I said I'd ask her, didn't I?

over here! I'm begging you!

Why do they just
want you to come?

425
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,630
[NAMI]
I dunno.

426
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,177
Well, I guess I might as
well see what they want.

427
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,931

You guys take care of the ship!

Is this it?

00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,486
[AMIGO PIRATE 426A] It matches
the description they gave,

rock bound and
surrounded by reefs.

433

against approaching ships.

Well. That's easy.

slow down this ship.

have landed on an island

Where settlers from

Surrounded by familiar sights,

they're suddently
reminded of home,

even in far away waters.

However, the peaceful
settlement is soon disrupted

from an attack by
