00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,734
No! Sir! I'm so sorry, sir!

176
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,237
You would do well to
remember who I am!

177
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,708
I am the only son of the great
marine captain Axe‐hand Morgan.

178
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,410
And don't you forget it!

179
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,313
[MARINES]
Yes, sir, Helmeppo, sir!

180
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,419
[HELMEPPO] Ah! Life sure was
good back then.

181
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,155
[COBY humming]

182
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,156
Damn it!

183
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,991
If it weren't for that
stupid straw hat guy,

184
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,759
none of this would of happened!

185
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,895
He showed up and
ruined everything!

186
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:16,996
Thanks to him,

187
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,832
my father lost his position
as a marine captain!

188
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,935
[MARINES] One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

189
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,003
It's all his fault!

190
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,872
It's because of that straw
hat guy that I'm here

191
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,841
doing stupid chores instead
of living the good life.

192
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,909
[COBY]
Hey, Helmeppo.

193
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,245
What d'ya want? Why are
you touching me like that?

194
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,113
Well, I'm sorry. I just...

195
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,448
I wanted to see if
you're all right,

196
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,016
you know, one friend to another.

197
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,084
A friend?

198
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,186
And why the heck would you
and I ever be friends?!

199
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,388
Well, we're both
chore boys, after all.

200
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,589
[HELMEPPO]
Hmph.

201
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,791
I shouldn't be in a place like
this doing stupid chores,

202
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,060
and I wouldn't be if it weren't
for that Straw Hat!

203
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,263
You shouldn't blame
everything on Luffy like that.

204
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,932
It isn't his fault; he was just
doing the right thing.

205
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,134
You can't just blame your fate
on other people all the time

206
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,069
and expect that to
solve everything.

207
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,705
That's a sign of weakness,
don't you think?

208
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,873
A weakness?!

209
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,442
[COBY] For a long time you could
use your father's power

210
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,112
to get through life.
Things are different now.

211
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,047
We've got to work long
and hard on our own

212
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,082
to accomplish our dreams!

213
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,417
Oh, please.

214
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,219
[COBY]
You know my dream?

215
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,255
Someday I'm gonna become a
great officer in the marines!

216
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,792
I'll chase bad guys
and defend justice!

217
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,896
[HELMEPPO]
How stupid can you be?!

218
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,732
A wimp like you becoming a
marine officer like my dad?!

219
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,100
No way that will ever happen!

220
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,335
I know that it will!

221
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,805
Thanks to Luffy, I know that
I can do anything that I want!

222
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,441
That's right! I'm gonna
be King of the Pirates!

223
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,177
I decided that long ago,
and if I die fighting for it,

224
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,912
it's all right!

225
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,315
[COBY] So I decided to be
like Luffy and do anything,

226
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,518
even risk my life, to
achieve my final goal.

227
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,586
Well?

228
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,121
Now we can work hard and
reach our goals together!

229
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,357
Forget it! You think I'm
going to listen to this?!

230
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,259
What the heck makes you
think you can tell me

231
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,861
what I should do?! And what
could you have possibly learned

232
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,830
from that pathetic
excuse for a pirate?

233
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,765
[COBY] Don't talk about
Luffy like that!

234
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,168
I haven't done anything
but try to help you out!

235
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,837
I don't remember
asking for your help!

236
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,304
[COBY yells]

237
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,439
[HELMEPPO yelps]

238
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,941
Helmeppo, will you please
just stop acting foolish?!

239
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,943
Oh, please! You're
calling me a fool?!

240
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,677
Take that!

241
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,279
[COBY]
Would you snap out of it?

242
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,448
[LIEUTENANT]
What's going on here?

243
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,649
[COBY]
Just stop it!

244
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,717
[MARINE 4] Sir, the chore boys
are fighting on the roof.

245
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:22,221
[LIEUTENANT] Why are you
standing here? Stop them!

246
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,957
[COBY, HELMEPPO scream]

247
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,361
[MARINES gasp]

248
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,196
[MARINES yelp]

249
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,003
[MARINES gasping]

250
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,838
[COBY, HELMEPPO whimper]

251
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,975
[LIEUTENANT growls]
You two!

252
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,511
[COBY, HELMEPPO]
We're... We're sorry, sir!

253
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,550
[RIKA] Really? That explosion
earlier was from you guys?

254
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,352
They didn't kick you
out of the marines,

255
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,553
did they, Coby?

256
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,588
[COBY]
Thank you, ma'am.

257
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,558
No, they actually allowed
us to stay enlisted.

258
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:03,529
Yeah, but we had to agree to
work for free for 50 years.

259
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:07,166
Getting kicked out would
have been so much better.

260
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,168
You two could use
some cheering up.

261
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,569
Yeah, look at this, Coby!

262
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,172
"Straw Hat Luffy Wreaks
Havoc in Loguetown!

263
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,175
Manages a baffling escape
from Captain Smoker."

264
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,011
Luffy's picture! Do you
realize what this means?!

265
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,048
Luffy's headed for
the Grand Line!

266
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,586
At last, he's making his
way closer and closer

267
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,923
to achieving his final goal!

268
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,709
[MARINE 5]
Attention!

269
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,478
[LIEUTENANT]
I will now inform you

270
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,248
about the nature of our mission.

271
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,383
[screams] Look!

272
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,085
What do you want?

273
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,655
[HELMEPPO]
It's my dad!

274
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,256
[LIEUTENANT]
Captain Morgan is being sent

275
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,491
to Marine Headquarters

276
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,894
to face a court martial for the
crimes of military exploitation

277
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,664
and the cruel and unusual
treatment of civilians.

278
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,933
Our mission is to
transfer the prisoner

279
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,835
to Vice‐Admiral Garp.

280
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,937
[MORGAN]
Rankless, low‐life bums!

281
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,606
You have no right to
defy my superiority!

282
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,242
I am Marine Captain
Axe‐hand Morgan

283
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,615
[HELMEPPO, COBY whimper]

284
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,158
[HELMEPPO] So I guess it's
really going to happen.

285
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,827
I mean, I know that he deserves
to get court‐martialed

286
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,863
and all of that.

287
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,334
I get it, given the stuff
that he did, but honestly...

288
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:52,538
...even after all that,
I still respected him.

289
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,707
He's my dad, you know,

290
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:59,445
and no matter what he did,
he was still my idol.

291
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:03,482
But I guess he did take
things a little too far, huh?

292
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,629
Damn it!

293
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:20,499
Why? [cries]

294
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:24,236
Coby, do you think that they're
going to execute him?

295
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,206
[COBY]
I don't know.

296
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,308
[HELMEPPO] I guess I
should probably be ready

297
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,744
for something like
that to happen, huh?

298
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,180
But he's my dad.

299
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,353
[COBY]
Helmeppo...

300
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,690
[MARINE 6]
Marines! All hands on deck!

301
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,525
[LIEUTENANT]
Fall in!

302
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,730
[MARINE 2]
It's Vice‐Admiral Garp!

303
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,700
[MARINES chattering]

304
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,672
[COBY] So that's Marine
Vice‐Admiral Garp!

305
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,607
The man they call the Fist!

306
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,342
He's a great hero of the seas

307
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,678
who travels all over
the Grand Line!

308
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,554
Vice‐Admiral Garp, thank you
for coming all this way.

309
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:22,394
We are pleased to deliver
Captain Morgan to you.

310
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,462
[HELMEPPO]
Dad! No!

311
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,866
[LIEUTENANT] Sir, did you
hear me Vice‐Admiral?

312
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,434
Vice‐Admiral Garp, sir!

313
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,403
Be quiet! I heard you.

314
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,640
I'm a bit tired because I've
been up for five days now.

315
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,742
You are indeed a
dedicated marine, sir!

316
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,477
No, I've been trying
to set a record

317
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,613
for the most doughnuts eaten
in a single sitting.

318
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:41,647
Sir?

319
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,482
The sugar kept
me going at first,

320
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,984
but I've been at it
for a while now,

321
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,655
and I guess the lack of sleep
is starting to get to me.

322
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,923
What a pathetic geezer.

323
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,057
[LIEUTENANT]
Morgan!

324
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,460
Vice‐Admiral Garp deserves
to be treated with respect

325
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,061
from the likes of you!

326
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,664
Old man. Cut the
sleeping act already.

327
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,599
[GARP snoring]

328
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,435
[HELMEPPO, COBY whimper]

329
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,439
[MARINES gasping]

330
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,275
[COBY, HELMEPPO scream]

331
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,810
No one move!

332
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,346
[HELMEPPO whimpering]

333
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,581
If anyone moves a muscle

334
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:19,752
I'll hack this chore boy up
and feed him to the sharks!

335
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,787
B‐But daddy, why
are you doing this?!

336
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,323
Sir, please stop this!
Helmeppo is your son!

337
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,358
How could you do something
like that to him?!

338
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,961
[MORGAN] My son?
What do I need with a son?!

339
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,963
What I want now is freedom!

340
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,631
I don't care about his life!

341
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,968
I'll cut him into a thousand
pieces if I have to!

342
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,771
[HELMEPPO]
But... Daddy!

343
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:39,805
