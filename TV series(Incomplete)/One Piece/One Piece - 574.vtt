WEBVTT

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.071
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.113
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.281
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.151
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.320
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.255
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:26.459
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:36.700
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:39.636
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.808
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:47.344
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:47.377 --> 00:02:50.581
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:50.614 --> 00:02:52.516
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.952
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:57.654
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.292
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.326 --> 00:03:03.927
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:03.961 --> 00:03:07.598
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:11.802
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:13.837 --> 00:03:15.539
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:15.572 --> 00:03:18.075
Luffy and his crew
arrive on Fishman Island,

00:03:18.108 --> 00:03:21.144
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:21.178 --> 00:03:24.314
There, they found themselves
facing the New Fishman Pirates,

00:03:24.348 --> 00:03:26.717
who were looking to destroy
the Ryugu Kingdom,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.086
and instigated an all-out war.

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:30.854
After a long and
grueling battle,

00:03:30.887 --> 00:03:32.689
Luffy finally defeated Hordy,

00:03:32.723 --> 00:03:34.858
the captain of the
New Fishman Pirates,

00:03:34.891 --> 00:03:36.593
thwarting their
plan for revenge.

00:03:36.627 --> 00:03:39.429
[LUFFY] All right,
New World, here we come!

00:03:39.463 --> 00:03:42.866
It's time to set sail!

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:46.570
I hope you and I can take
another stroll together, Luffy.

00:03:48.138 --> 00:03:52.643
[SHIRAHOSHI] I want to visit a
real forest, on the surface!

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:54.645
Sure. Let's do it!

00:03:54.678 --> 00:03:57.414
I'll take you there
first chance I get!

00:03:58.548 --> 00:04:00.717
[ALL]
We won't let you down!

00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:08.191
Who knows what's waiting
for us up there!

00:04:08.225 --> 00:04:11.461
That's the greatest
sea in the world!

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:14.698
All right!

00:04:14.731 --> 00:04:18.268
Let's go!

00:04:18.302 --> 00:04:21.204
The New World's waiting!

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.744
[LUFFY] "To the New World!
Heading for the Ultimate Sea!"

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:41.425
[NARRATOR]
After leaving Fishman Island,

00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:45.062
the Straw Hat Pirates are making
their ascent into the New World,

00:04:45.095 --> 00:04:47.898
the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:04:51.168 --> 00:04:53.103
Smooth sailing so far.

00:04:53.136 --> 00:04:55.138
Yeah, almost too smooth.

00:04:55.172 --> 00:04:56.673
Dude, I'm getting hungry.

00:04:56.707 --> 00:04:58.842
You've tied enough
knots already!

00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:02.446
Hold your horses, Luffy.
I'm almost done, okay?

00:05:06.316 --> 00:05:12.189
[NAMI humming]

00:05:12.222 --> 00:05:15.525
[NAMI sighs]
This feels great.

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:18.128
It's a technique
called Shower Tempo.

00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:19.596
You wanna try it, too?

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.833
[CHOPPER] Nah. It does
look neat, but I'm okay.

00:05:22.866 --> 00:05:24.901
I brushed my fur two days ago.

00:05:24.935 --> 00:05:27.170
What would be really cool
is if I could take a bite

00:05:27.204 --> 00:05:29.873
of that fluffy cotton
candy you got there!

00:05:29.906 --> 00:05:31.608
[NAMI]
That's a cloud, silly.

00:05:31.641 --> 00:05:32.776
[CHOPPER]
Aw, man!

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:34.711
But it looks so sweet and yummy!

00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:37.381
[BROOK] Oh my, it seems there's
something sweet and yummy

00:05:37.414 --> 00:05:38.382
in the bathroom!

00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:41.017
[SANJI] Doesn't get any
more yummy than that!

00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:42.252
[BROOK gasping]

00:05:42.285 --> 00:05:44.988
[SANJI] That's great, Nami,
now let's see the other side.

00:05:45.021 --> 00:05:46.857
[BROOK giggles]

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.993
[NAMI]
Chopper? You might wanna move.

00:05:50.026 --> 00:05:51.228
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

00:05:52.596 --> 00:05:55.866
[BROOK, SANJI scream]

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:56.800
[CHOPPER]
Yikes!

00:05:56.833 --> 00:05:59.469
And to think I wanted
to eat that thing!

00:06:01.872 --> 00:06:04.574
[NAMI sighs]
Perfect.

00:06:04.608 --> 00:06:07.811
My first bath on the
Sunny in two years!

00:06:10.514 --> 00:06:11.948
And it's even more luxurious

00:06:11.982 --> 00:06:14.351
with this gorgeous
underwater view.

00:06:14.384 --> 00:06:16.553
This really is the life!

00:06:16.586 --> 00:06:19.122
[CHOPPER] Don't they need you
on the deck to navigate?

00:06:19.156 --> 00:06:20.724
They can take care of
things themselves

00:06:20.757 --> 00:06:24.027
as long as I go back up before
we get to an upward current.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.595
I might as well take my time.

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:27.998
They can handle a
sea monster or two.

00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:32.636
Come on, Usopp, hurry!

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.438
Just gimme one more minute.

00:06:34.471 --> 00:06:35.672
If we're gonna catch a big one,

00:06:35.705 --> 00:06:38.341
then the rope's gotta
be extra strong!

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.413
Okay, this oughtta do
the trick. [chuckles]

00:06:43.447 --> 00:06:44.748
What do you think?

00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:45.715
Ta-dah!

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:46.950
[LUFFY giggles]
Ooh!

00:06:46.983 --> 00:06:49.252
Oh my. What's all this?

00:06:49.286 --> 00:06:52.389
[LUFFY giggles] I was so
excited to see Fishman Island

00:06:52.422 --> 00:06:54.558
on the way down,
I forgot to catch some fish!

00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:57.093
I bet we can nab something
totally crazy down here!

00:06:57.127 --> 00:06:59.729
And then Sanji can
cook it up on the spot!

00:06:59.763 --> 00:07:02.632
As long as it pairs well
with cola, count me in!

00:07:02.666 --> 00:07:05.268
Seafood dinner, huh? I like it.

00:07:05.302 --> 00:07:07.471
But if we're gonna celebrate
our trip to the New World,

00:07:07.504 --> 00:07:09.005
then I want some booze, too.

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:11.808
Now, which one of these
looks the tastiest?

00:07:11.842 --> 00:07:14.478
Let's pick something
really juicy!

00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:17.347
[ZORO] That one would be
good fried with some salt.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.984
Fried fish with salt,
huh? My favorite!

00:07:21.017 --> 00:07:23.787
[USOPP] Or we could slice up
that skinny one and grill it!

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.922
That works, too! [giggles]

00:07:25.956 --> 00:07:27.791
Ooh! How 'bout that one?

00:07:27.824 --> 00:07:30.727
It's nice and fat. Let's filet
it and drown it in mayo!

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.330
Huh? This guy?

00:07:34.764 --> 00:07:37.133
[USOPP, ZORO]
Luffy. You'll eat anything.

00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:40.237
That creepy thing'll taste like
crap no matter how you cook it.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.438
You think so?

00:07:41.471 --> 00:07:45.108
Eh, meat is meat to me! [laughs]

00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:47.210
Second Gear!

00:07:47.244 --> 00:07:49.279
I could eat on that
thing for a whole week

00:07:49.312 --> 00:07:50.780
and still not get full!

00:07:50.814 --> 00:07:52.816
Now, Gum-Gum...

00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:55.952
...Jet Pistol!

00:07:55.986 --> 00:07:59.389
[USOPP]
Ugh, now it's even uglier!

00:07:59.422 --> 00:08:01.591
You sure the Sunny can carry it?

00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:04.027
Let's find out!
Hurry and catch it!

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.063
Special Attack. Capture Star!

00:08:09.766 --> 00:08:11.034
[USOPP]
Hooked him!

00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:13.537
[LUFFY]
Deep sea dinner!

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.705
Oh man, I can't
wait to taste it!

00:08:15.739 --> 00:08:18.708
That nose. It doesn't
even look like a fish.

00:08:18.742 --> 00:08:20.210
More like a gross old man.

00:08:20.243 --> 00:08:21.545
[LUFFY]
Kinda.

00:08:21.578 --> 00:08:23.246
[gasps]

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.082
[USOPP gasps]
That's the end of that!

00:08:26.116 --> 00:08:28.385
[BOTH gasp]

00:08:28.418 --> 00:08:30.520
[USOPP]
Agh! Wow, this is nuts!

00:08:30.554 --> 00:08:32.889
Our dinner became dinner,
became dinner!

00:08:32.923 --> 00:08:35.125
[LUFFY]
Even better! Let's reel it in!

00:08:35.158 --> 00:08:36.126
[USOPP]
Does that thing look like

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.961
it'll fit on the deck, Luffy?

00:08:37.994 --> 00:08:40.830
[ZORO] Damn it, you're gonna
flip the Sunny upside down!

00:08:40.864 --> 00:08:42.465
Hey, you think something's up?

00:08:42.499 --> 00:08:45.735
The ship's all wobbly and Luffy
and Usopp are screaming.

00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:49.306
I swear, I can't leave those
idiots alone for ten minutes.

00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:53.510
[ZORO] One-Sword Style,
360-Caliber Phoenix!

00:08:55.412 --> 00:08:57.380
[LUFFY]
Nice one, Zoro!

00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:00.884
[SANJI]
What's all the noise about?

00:09:00.917 --> 00:09:02.352
Hey look, Sanji.

00:09:02.385 --> 00:09:03.687
We just caught a fish!

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.121
Yeah, I see that.

00:09:05.155 --> 00:09:06.623
Good job, guys.

00:09:06.656 --> 00:09:08.592
Can't say I've ever
cooked anything that big.

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:09.826
This should be fun.

00:09:09.859 --> 00:09:10.961
What the--?

00:09:10.994 --> 00:09:12.796
Looks like you got cooked.

00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:14.230
[BROOK chuckles]

00:09:14.264 --> 00:09:16.232
[LUFFY] And I haven't even
told you the best part!

00:09:16.266 --> 00:09:18.001
There's a giant
fish inside of it

00:09:18.034 --> 00:09:20.236
with a giant fish inside of it!

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.939
[USOPP] I'm more concerned
about the ship, actually.

00:09:22.973 --> 00:09:25.809
It kinda feels like
we might be sinking.

00:09:25.842 --> 00:09:27.444
[LUFFY]
Nah, we're fine.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.516
[gasps] What's that
thing over there?

00:09:33.516 --> 00:09:34.584
Huh?

00:09:34.618 --> 00:09:36.152
It can't be.

00:09:37.287 --> 00:09:41.524
[gasping] It's some
kinda sea snake!

00:09:41.558 --> 00:09:42.726
[LUFFY laughs]

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:45.428
[LUFFY] Awesome! Get closer,
we can eat that, too!

00:09:45.462 --> 00:09:48.131
[USOPP] I think we've
got more than enough!

00:09:48.164 --> 00:09:51.134
[ROBIN]
Wait. I know what that is.

00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:52.535
Huh?

00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:54.404
[ROBIN]
That's Whitestrom!

00:09:54.437 --> 00:09:55.739
It's a massive whirlpool

00:09:55.772 --> 00:09:58.408
that appears suddenly
in the deep sea,

00:09:58.441 --> 00:10:00.877
like a liquid sea monster!

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.112
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:10:03.546 --> 00:10:05.582
Wow, that looks pretty crazy!

00:10:05.615 --> 00:10:07.917
[USOPP] I don't understand
what that thing is,

00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:10.553
but I know I don't like it!

00:10:13.289 --> 00:10:15.525
[NAMI]
What have they done now?

00:10:15.558 --> 00:10:17.093
[NAMI gasps]
Oh, no!

00:10:17.127 --> 00:10:20.030
That must be the Whitestrom!

00:10:20.063 --> 00:10:22.832
[ROBIN] They say that whenever
a ship gets caught inside it,

00:10:22.866 --> 00:10:25.368
it'll be found
somewhere far away,

00:10:25.402 --> 00:10:26.803
usually without its crew.

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:29.105
[gasps] I know what that means.

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:30.640
They all died somewhere at sea!

00:10:30.674 --> 00:10:32.075
We have to go!

00:10:32.108 --> 00:10:33.843
It's way too dangerous!

00:10:33.877 --> 00:10:37.047
So they ended up somewhere
totally different, huh?

00:10:38.314 --> 00:10:39.149
Cool.

00:10:39.182 --> 00:10:41.384
I say we jump in
and see where we go!

00:10:41.418 --> 00:10:42.952
I don't think so!

00:10:42.986 --> 00:10:44.254
Hurry!

00:10:44.287 --> 00:10:47.123
We have to get away from
the whirlpool right now!

00:10:47.157 --> 00:10:49.726
Okay! You heard the navigator!

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:51.327
It's change our course or die!

00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:54.464

00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:48.918
[STRAW HATS]
The New World!

00:21:48.951 --> 00:21:49.985
[LUFFY]
Finally!

00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:53.022
[FRANKY]
We did it, everybody!

00:21:53.055 --> 00:21:55.057
[USOPP] Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

00:21:55.091 --> 00:21:56.792
[USOPP, CHOPPER scream]

00:22:01.764 --> 00:22:03.733
Whoa. They saved us!

00:22:03.766 --> 00:22:06.001
Don't worry! As soon
as we find Laboon,

00:22:06.035 --> 00:22:09.472
we'll be sure to let him know
where the rest of you are!

00:22:10.806 --> 00:22:13.309
It was an honor
to meet his family!

00:22:13.342 --> 00:22:15.177
Please take care, all of you!

00:22:15.211 --> 00:22:18.314
Thanks for your help!
See you again sometime!

00:22:22.184 --> 00:22:23.719
[USOPP]
I've heard stories about it,

00:22:23.753 --> 00:22:26.021
but I never imagined
it would be like this.

00:22:26.055 --> 00:22:29.692
Turns out the first danger we
have to face in the New World...

00:22:30.693 --> 00:22:32.828
...is really bad weather!

00:22:32.862 --> 00:22:35.264
Ha! Look at that lightning!

00:22:35.297 --> 00:22:37.032
The winds are raging!

00:22:37.066 --> 00:22:39.068
Yeah, the water's rough, too!

00:22:39.101 --> 00:22:41.370
The needle's going crazy!

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.845
I see some ships over there!

00:22:49.879 --> 00:22:52.047
Probably pirates having a party.

00:22:52.081 --> 00:22:54.483
No way, it's a
group of warships.

00:22:54.517 --> 00:22:57.119
Sounds like a party to me!

00:23:02.825 --> 00:23:05.327
[STRAW HATS]
Huh? The Navy?

00:23:11.367 --> 00:23:12.368
[NARRATOR]
The Straw Hats surface

00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:13.869
in the New World at last,

00:23:13.903 --> 00:23:14.970
but are met with a series of

00:23:15.004 --> 00:23:17.239
bizarre and dangerous
weather conditions.

00:23:17.273 --> 00:23:18.874
Soon, they encounter
a young girl

00:23:18.908 --> 00:23:20.443
small enough to
fit in their hand

00:23:20.476 --> 00:23:23.279
and fierce enough to
challenge the entire crew.

00:23:23.312 --> 00:23:24.980
Tempted by the promise of food,

00:23:25.014 --> 00:23:27.016
they agree to help her
with a rescue operation

00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:29.118
that sends them
hurtling head-first

00:23:29.151 --> 00:23:30.453
into a fight with the Navy.

00:23:30.486 --> 00:23:32.021
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.024 --> 00:23:35.057
"Z's Ambition!
Lily the Little Giant!"

00:23:35.057 --> 00:23:35.124
"Z's Ambition!
Lily the Little Giant!"
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:23:35.124 --> 00:23:37.726
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
