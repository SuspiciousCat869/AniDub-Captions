1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,283
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,827
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:45,373
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:51,337
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,923
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,468
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,013
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,558
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,686
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,231
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,817
[NARRATOR]
After the battle with Duval

48
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,485
and the Flying Fish Riders,

49
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,654
the Straw Hat Pirates
continued their journey

50
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,823
toward Fishman Island.

51
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:23,411
Uh, so, do you
like them, Nami?

52
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,496
Listen. Don't think
I'm going to forgive you

53
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,956
'cause of something
silly like this.

54
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,874
Nooo!

55
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,125
No, of course not!
That's not what I meant!

56
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,962
I just wanted to know if ya
think it tastes good, honestly!

57
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,797
It's really delicious!

58
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,717
Nyuuuuu!

59
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,345
You think so?
Do you mean that?

60
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,846
There are actually
two separate routes

61
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,307
one can travel
to reach the New World.

62
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,017
But for outlaws
such as yourselves,

63
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,311
only one of them
is a viable option.

64
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,520
The passage you'll be taking,

65
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,356
ya don't have to
get rid of your ship.

66
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:55,068
And that passage is the
great Sea Floor Route,

67
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,487
straight through Fishman Island!

68
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,947
The Red Line may
be the most massive wall

69
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,365
in the whole world.

70
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,866
But it's not totally solid,

71
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,369
and there's one small hole
that passes through it.

72
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,704
And inside that hole
is Fishman Island!

73
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,958
[NARRATOR] In order to prepare
the Sunny to travel underwater,

74
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,502
Luffy and his crew set sail
for a certain island

75
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,337
not far out of the way.

76
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,507
[PAPPAGU]
This is it!

77
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,343
The Sabaody Archipelago!

78
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,430
[LUFFY]
So cool!

79
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,604
A bubble popped
out of the ground!

80
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,064
How weird is that?

81
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:36,693
[LUFFY]
I'm riding it!

82
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,652
Wow!

83
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,611
So, Hachi.

84
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,613
What's our objective
on this island anyway?

85
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,864
Nyuu!

86
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,741
We'll meet up with one of the
island's coating specialists

87
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,411
and have him slap a coat
of this resin on your ship.

88
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,745
That's all it takes.

89
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,497
After that, your ship
will be fully equipped

90
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,957
for underwater travel.

91
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,084
Seriously?

92
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,877
[NARRATOR] Intending to meet
with the coating mechanic

93
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,129
Hachi spoke of,

94
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,924
the Straw Hat Pirates set out to
explore the Sabaody Archipelago.

95
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,053
[LUFFY]
Tyranny!

96
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,724
The Rulers of Sabaody,
the Celestial Dragons!

97
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,870
Everyone else went to town.

98
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,705
Why didn't the
two of you go with them?

99
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,166
We used up a lot of cola
in that battle with Duval.

100
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,709
Damn near all of it.

101
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,962
It's my job to take
good care of the Sunny.

102
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,172
That's right.

103
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,340
And I like helping out with
all things ship-related, too.

104
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,676
Once we're done, all three
of us can head out together.

105
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,927
What do you say? Sound good?

106
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:45,970
[SANJI]
Sorry.

107
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,805
Thanks for the invite,
but I can't do my shopping

108
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,058
until a certain
someone comes back.

109
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,017
[USOPP]
Wait, what do you mean?

110
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,477
Well, you see...

111
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,149
...my beloved Nami was in a jam.

112
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,860
Now what to do?

113
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,487
We have a ton of
treasure on board,

114
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,864
and I can't leave the ship
knowing it's unguarded.

115
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,657
If only there was a
valiant knight around

116
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,159
to keep an eye on it.

117
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,827
That's me!

118
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,164
She's got you wrapped
around her finger, doesn't she?

119
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,208
[SANJI]
I am a slave to love!

120
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,502
[USOPP] You admitting it
saves me the trouble.

121
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,092
[USOPP]
Hey! Zoro!

122
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,636
[SANJI]
Zoro! Wait!

123
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,179
[USOPP and SANJI]
Where do you think you're going

124
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,014
all by yourself?

125
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,019
[ZORO]
For a walk. That okay?

126
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,187
[USOPP]
Of course not!

127
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,648
You're gonna get
yourself lost, moron!

128
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,941
This is an archipelago!

129
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,526
We won't be able to find you!

130
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,194
Screw you!
I'm not gonna get lost!

131
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,197
Only an idiot would get turned
around in a place like this!

132
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,866
All of these trees
have numbers on them, okay?

133
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,744
That way it doesn't matter how
bad your sense of direction is.

134
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,954
Whoa!

135
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,664
Nice job!

136
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,207
You actually put
some thought into this.

137
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,542
Yeah, good call!

138
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,669
All right, then! Have fun!

139
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,630
[USOPP] Ask for directions
if you get confused!

140
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,841
[SANJI]
Don't trust your instincts!

141
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,218
Screw these guys.

142
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,761
I'll be all right.

143
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,222
I just have to remember
the number on this tree.

144
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,062
And that number is one.

145
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,065
What, do they
think I can't count?

146
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,776
You'd have to be brain dead to
get lost in a place like this.

147
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,988
I'm not taking
anymore crap from them.

148
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,456
The World Nobles I mentioned

149
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,958
are also known as
the Celestial Dragons.

150
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,127
They think they're so much
better than everyone else

151
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,088
they wear masks to avoid
breathing the same air as us.

152
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,631
Now remember what I said:

153
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,842
No matter what they do,
just stay out of their way!

154
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,635
I need you to promise me that!

155
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,970
[LUFFY]
Uh-huh.

156
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:51,804
[HACHI]
Aside from that,

157
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,722
there are a couple
of other things

158
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,766
you should probably
keep an eye out for.

159
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,102
Remember, this is the
place everyone gathers

160
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,730
before heading to the New World.

161
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,814
In other words, like you,

162
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,192
there're a lot of big
name pirate crews around.

163
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,445
Which means marines and bounty
hunters are out to catch them.

164
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,989
[HACHI] Also, the law
won't protect pirates

165
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,824
from being bought and sold here.

166
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,035
Kidnapping happens all the time.

167
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,828
So try not to stand out.

168
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,580
If people realize
how much you're worth,

169
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,706
the whole island'll be on you

170
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,541
and we'll never
get the ship coated.

171
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,461
And fair warning, the marines
here aren't pushovers.

172
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,879
We're right by
Navy Headquarters,

173
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,215
so you never know which
powerhouses might show up.

174
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,592
The bounty hunters here
are pretty ferocious, too.

175
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,928
They're a lot tougher
than what you're used to.

176
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,638
Oh, yeah!
And one more thing.

177

00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,445
[LUFFY]
Right over here!

352
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:53,077
[HACHI]
Oh yeah?! Nyuuuuu!

353
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,244
Yeah!

354
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,580
I'm winning,
I'm winning, I'm winning!

355
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,290
Don't get so cocky!

356
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,626
We've still got
a long way to go!

357
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,752
Yeah, keep it up!

358
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,337
You can do it, Hachin!

359
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,755
What the heck is
wrong with you guys?

360
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,590
When did this turn
into some kind of race?

361
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,761
[yelling, cheering]

362
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,153
Oh! I'm so sorry!

363
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,784
Wait! What are you--

364
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,663
No! I didn't mean to!

365
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,415
Stop it, please!

366
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,209
[BIG MAN]
You gotta help me!

367
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,460
I'm begging you!

368
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,339
Get it off!
Get this thing off of me!

369
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,799
I just...

370
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,720
I just wanna leave!
I just wanna go back home!

[CROWD murmuring]

372
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,478
Hey. What's all
that yelling about?

375
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,151
Get me outta this damn thing!

376
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,611
Bring me something!

377
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,739
Somebody bring me a damn tool!

378
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,743
An axe, a saw, something
to get this thing off of me!

379
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,370
All I want is to go back home!

380
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,830
I don't wanna hurt anybody!

381
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,372
Please, sir.

382
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,500
Let go. Don't kill me.

383
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,132
I give up!

384
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,426
I don't wanna go to the
New World anymore!

385
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,345
Please! I've got a wife
and kid back home!

386
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,847
I'm begging you here!

387
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,475
Somebody help me!

388
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,642
My little boy...

389
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,644
I left when he was just a baby.

390
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,397
He doesn't even know
what I look like!

391
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,524
Help me, please!

392
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,777
Who's that?

393
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,861
[BIG MAN]
I wanna go home!

That's all that matters now!

395
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,530
I won't hurt you!

396
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,865
Let's stay out of this.

397
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,366
He's probably just some pirate

398
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,411
who was caught by kidnappers
and sold into slavery.

399
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,246
His owner must've
brought him to this island

400
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,332
and then he made a run for it.

401
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,709
But he must know
what happens to slaves

402
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,503

What's that sound?

406
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,388
Why's he ticking?

407
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,974
[BIG MAN]
This collar!

408
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,728
If I could only get
this thing off my neck!

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,647

00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,898

Every slave has one
of those metal collars

put around their neck.

417
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,430
And if they try to take it off
or run from their master,

418
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,890
it'll explode.

Just let me go
home to my family.

in the New World anymore.

not to get involved

will be here any minute!

It's all right.

Fine. Just this once.

They're here!

440
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,658
That's not a dragon.

Yeah.

Oh, look, father.

00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,532
Another one of our
slaves has broken down.

its daily sedative

like you were supposed to?

454
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,454
Of course I did.

00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,957
But it seems it had no
effect on this poor fool.

I don't even
want it anymore.

457
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,671

Perhaps something smaller,

like a human child.

Ugh, I detest the weak ones.

474
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,386

00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,862
It'll calm your nerves.

00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,156
I feel terrible.

480
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,115
Thanks, though.

481
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,659
[LUFFY] You think
he's gonna be all right?

482
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,161
Maybe so, but If he lives,

483
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,996
he'll go to prison for piracy.

484
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,289
I don't understand!

485
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,958
An old man and a woman are no
match for a pirate like that!

486
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,126
What's going on here?

487
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,462
If anyone hurts
a Celestial Dragon,

488
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,921
Navy Headquarters
sends an admiral

489
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,966
and a fleet of battle ships
to handle the situation.

490
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,886
An admiral?

491
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,762
You mean Aokiji?

492
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,056
It could be him,
or Akainu, or Kizaru.

493
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,932
No telling which one
of them will show up.

494
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,976
Remember, we're right by HQ.

495
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,228
What makes those
Celestial Dragons so special?

496
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,813
The Dragons are
from the bloodline

497
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,566
of the creators of
the World Government.

498
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,109
Are you serious?

499
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,153
800 years ago,
a group of twenty kings

500
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,113
came together to create
the organization

501
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,657
that's now known as
the World Government.

502
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,993
The Celestial Dragons
are their descendants.

503
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,205
As the years go by,
generation after generation,

504
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,749
they grow more and more
reckless with power.

505
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,460
Celestial Dragons.

506
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,590
[BOUNTY HUNTER 391A]
It's him.

00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,844
[BOUNTY HUNTER 391B]
Yeah, Straw Hat Luffy.

[LUFFY]
Wait, you've heard of me?

512
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,196
[SHAKKY] A man with a
300-million berry bounty

513
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,240
has quite the reputation.

514
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,242
But there's another rookie
visiting the archipelago

515
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,536
with an even higher bounty.

516
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,830
[CHOPPER] He's worth
even more than Luffy?!

I'm gonna be
