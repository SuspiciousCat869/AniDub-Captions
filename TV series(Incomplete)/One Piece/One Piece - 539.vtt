00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.171
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.174
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.877
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.414
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.515
You can have it!

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.385
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.723
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.326
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:39.125
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.995
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:46.032
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.335
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.938
to ever chart these waters
and learn all the secrets

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.106
they held.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.941
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:57.343
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.546
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.082
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:06.352
a boy whose body became rubber
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:09.989
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:13.526
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.465
[NARRATOR] Two years have passed
since the War of the Best

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:20.800
in Marineford.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:24.437
Luffy and his crew reunite to
continue on to the New World.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.173
Their first stop
is Fishman Island.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.509
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.744
and assisted by Vander Decken,

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:34.614
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:37.116
It's not long before the
Straw Hats get pulled into

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.219
the conflict.

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:42.555
Aided by Neptune, Zoro, Usopp,
and Brook attempt to escape

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:43.723
the palace.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:46.759
However, their efforts were
quickly thwarted by Hordy,

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.661
whose strengh
increased dramatically

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:51.464
after taking a drug known
as the Energy Steroid.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.336
Meanwhile, Luffy and the others
arrive at the Sea Forest,

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:57.971
where they meet with Jimbei.

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:00.907
Eleven years ago,

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.909
Arlong was locked away
by the Government,

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:05.511
and even knowing what
evils he was capable of...

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.681
...I freed him.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:16.155
[LUFFY]
"The Haunting Ties!

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.091
Nami and the Fishman Pirates!"

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:28.568
[ROBIN] There must be a key
to the void in history

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.902
here somewhere.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.304
I'm sure of it.

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.876
To think that the missing piece
may have been here

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.212
for several centuries,
untouched.

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:43.483
If I keep going,
I know I'll find something.

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.458
Bingo!

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:58.264
But what about King Neptune?

00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.499
Don't look back!

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.668
The king's giving us a chance
to make it out of here!

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:03.970
[SOLDIER B]
The exit!

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:06.906
[SOLDIER A]
We made it outside!

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.241
[SOLDIER B]
Activate the coral!

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:13.313
That didn't go well at all!

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:14.881
Few guards escaped!

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:17.684
King Neptune sacrificed
himself and we have nothing

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:19.018
to show for it!

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.320
We failed you!

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:21.354
Oh, quit your whining!

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:23.589
We followed his orders,
plain and simple!

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:24.524
Listen up!

00:05:24.557 --> 00:05:26.225
This is by no means a retreat!

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.628
We'll save the king,
take back the Ryugu Palace,

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.431
and eradicate that pirate
scum in due time!

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:32.532
But first off,

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.400
we need to contact
Prince Fukaboshi

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:35.401
and his brothers!

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:36.369
[FISHMEN SOLDIERS]
Yeah!

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:38.905
Find the Princes as soon
as you can, got it?

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:41.107
After that,
we'll start regrouping

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.476
and make our way
back to the palace!

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:44.410
[FISHMEN SOLDIERS]
Right!

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.579
What town's closest
to where we are now?

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.114
Fishverly Hills, sir!

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:50.249
--[FISHMEN yell]
--[FISHMAN A] Look out!

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:52.318
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
in the high-class district

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.886
of Fishverly Hills...

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:56.189
[FISHMAN A]
Run away!

00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:57.857
[PIRATE A]
Get in a line, now!

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.692
[PIRATE B] You'll do it if you
know what's good for ya!

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.495
I don't understand.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:03.963
What do you want from us?

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:04.664
Stomp it.

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:05.631
[FISHMAN B]
What?

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:06.632
It's a test!

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.401
[FISHMAN B]
But why?

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.069
[IKAROS]
Do as we say!

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:13.740
It won't be long before Hordy
rules this country-hhi.

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:18.111
Now, step on the picture!

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:20.046
But I can't do that.

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:22.215
Yes. You can!

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:24.183
[laughing]

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:27.286
[NARRATOR] At Candy Factory
Town, in the northeast...

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:31.290
Come on, put your foot down!

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.660
I can't!

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:35.928
Huh?

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:36.963
I won't do it!

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:38.531
I can't tread on her image!

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:40.133
I beg you to understand.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:41.300
[PIRATE E]
Shut up!

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:42.468
[DARUMA]
Ka ka!

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:44.637
Those who won't follow
our orders will be branded

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.706
as human sympathizers.

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:50.276
Which means...
you'll also be our enemy!

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:51.511
[NARRATOR]
In the southeast,

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:53.513
outside the Fishman
Culture Hall...

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:55.548
[FISHMEN arguing]

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.385
[HYOUZOU]
Whoa, calm down!

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.553
I'll make it easy for you:

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:03.489
step on the picture, or get
ready to leave the island.

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:04.724
It's your choice.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:06.626
[FISHMAN C]
That ain't happening!

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.461
Come on, guys!

00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:10.163
This guy can't be that tough!

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:14.233
[FISHMEN]
Huh?

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:18.371
[FISHMEN yell]

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:21.908
Just step on the picture.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:25.111
Anyone who doesn't wanna

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:27.880
is gonna get sliced up
real good.

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:30.283
[NARRATOR] At the Marine
Shopping Mall in the east...

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:31.951
Whaddya mean,
"Leave the country"?

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:33.019
This is our home!

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:34.020
We can't leave!

00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:36.222
No other place on
the seafloor gets light.

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:37.824
Besides, you're Fishmen too.

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:40.026
What makes you think
humans will accept us?

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:41.060
[ZEO]
See?

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:45.264
You already know how easily
humans will discriminate

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.568
against anything that's
different from them.

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:49.535
Hey!

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.337
What in the heck is
happening to you, man?

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.572
[FISHMAN 539G]
He's being choked!

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:54.874
[ZEO] There's no way
that humans and Fishmen

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.909
will ever coexist peacefully.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:59.278
Your best bet is to accept
the rule of Hordy!

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:04.650
Under his reign, we'll have
the power to change history!

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:08.187
[NARRATOR] At Waterwheel
Town, in the north...

Dosun!

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.592
Hey. I think it's your turn.

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:13.860
It'll be easy.

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:16.295
I can't do it!

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.301
You still haven't
stepped on it yet?

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.070
Then what good are you?

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:25.104
Die!

Hey. Aren't you... Fukaboshi?

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.350
What is the meaning this?

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:38.651
Explain yourself!

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:39.952
[DOSUN]
Heh...

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:42.355
You scum. How dare you!

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:43.923
Forcing people to tread
on the image

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:46.926
of my late mother!

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.432
[NARRATOR] At Coral Hill,
after the departure of Luffy

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:54.700
and the others...

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:56.602
It's too late!
There's nothing we can do!

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:58.938
You're right.
We let Vander Decken escape,

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:01.140
and before that,
we couldn't stop the Straw Hats

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:03.042
from kidnapping
Princess Shirahoshi!

00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:06.178
Didn't the princess say
she'd be back home

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.246
in time for dinner?

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.447
[FISHMAN 539O]
Fool!

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.483
They made her say that so
we wouldn't chase after them!

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:12.251
There's a group from
the Fishman District

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:14.353
that's terrorizing
the entire island!

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.421
Seriously?

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:17.657
Well, did they say what's
happening over there?

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.058
This is unbelievable.

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:20.993
They said that mermaids
are being reported missing

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:22.061
all over!

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.329
Princess Shirahoshi...

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:25.131
They wouldn't sell her
to the Celestial Dragons,

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:25.932
would they?

Hey! Awful news.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:32.238
It looks like another mermaid

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:39.512
Got another one!

Who knew it would be this easy?

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:42.748
Even so...

I've just gotta get
my hands on that one!

She's the biggest
mermaid I've ever seen!

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:54.126
If a human-sized mermaid
can net me 70 million,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.429
then a mermaid that's
ten times that size

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:58.864
is bound to bring in
an even greater haul!

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.433
It's a mermaid mother lode!

Please, Princess. Do not worry.

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:25.758

control of the palace,

but King Neptune
will not give in so easily!

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:30.529
Your father is tougher
than you realize!

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:32.565
Huh? You really think so?

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:34.433
I do. Still...

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.802
I will help save
the king, at any cost!

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:38.638
Oh, well...

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:39.905
Thank you, Jimbei!

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:41.674
I'll be counting on you!

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:43.709
Now. Please excuse me.

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:46.312
I have a matter to discuss
with Luffy and his crew.

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:50.483
[SANJI humming]

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:53.352
[SANJI]
Beautiful Ladies!

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.455
Please have some tea!

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:59.058
Whatever, just leave it
over there for right now.

00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:01.327
Yeah. You've bothered
us enough already.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.029
We're having a serious talk!

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:06.198
You're so sexy when
you're stern with me, Nami!

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:08.567
Sanjichin hasn't
changed one bit!

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:09.735
Mmm, good!

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:12.104
Idiot, that's not for you!
Give it back!

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:13.506
[NAMI]
All right, Jimbei.

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:14.507
Let's settle this.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.749
Tell me. What did you mean?

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:26.585
Earlier, you said you
set Arlong loose

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:27.920
into the East Blue.

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:30.823
[HACHI]
Nyuu!

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:32.758
Jimbei, wait!

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:33.826
It's fine.

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:37.029
[SANJI]
I heard the same thing.

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:37.897
[NAMI]
What?

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:38.731
[SANJI]
Yeah.

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:39.732
A while back.

00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:41.634
When Luffy and I first
learned about Jimbei

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:43.035
of the Seven Warlords.

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:46.138
Yosaku told us about the
bargain that Jimbei struck.

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:47.873
He's a warlord.

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:50.176
In exchange for becoming
one of the Seven,

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:54.480
Jimbei let a dangerous Fishman
run wild in the East Blue.

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:56.582
Ah. Is that what he told us?

00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:58.050
Surprise, surprise.

00:11:58.084 --> 00:11:59.452
You didn't remember.

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:02.321
Wonder how Yosaku's doing now.

00:12:02.354 --> 00:12:04.056
Two years ago,
when I read about you

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.259
associating with Jimbei
in the newspaper,

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:11.497
I honestly didn't know
what to think about it.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.399
I thought Jimbei
had been the key figure

00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:16.669
pulling Arlong's strings
and telling him what to do.

00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:19.705
So, Jimbei.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.608
I'll give you a chance
to defend what happened,

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:25.611
but choose your words wisely.

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:28.347
After all, our very
own navigator here

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:33.819
had her entire life ruined
thanks to your buddy Arlong.

00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:37.656
To put it simply,
whatever you did

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.725
turned her world
into a living hell.

00:12:42.728 --> 00:12:45.297
Depending on what
you have to say,

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:47.032
I might not forgive you!

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:52.838
[HACHI groans]

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:53.973
[CAMIE]
Careful, Hatchin!

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.174
[CHOPPER]
Don't move too much!

00:12:55.207 --> 00:12:57.009
Your wounds could open up again!

00:12:57.042 --> 00:13:00.146
But he's right!
We caused her so much grief.

00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:03.048
It's horrible, and all the
apologizing in the world

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:04.283
won't change a thing.

00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:28.607
[NAMI] I'm gonna guide ships
around all the oceans

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:29.675
of the world.

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.010
It'll be great!

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:32.077
And then,

00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:35.181
I can make maps of all
the far off places I'll go!

00:13:35.214 --> 00:13:38.417
This map's the first step
to realizing your dream.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:39.618
Is that about right?

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:40.653
Yep!

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:43.856
[BELLEMERE]
Nami. Nojiko.

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:46.492
None of us are actually related.

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:49.795
But that doesn't mean
we're not a family!

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:15.254
[VILLAGER N]
Pirates!

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:18.057
Pirates are coming!
Everybody run!

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:22.294
Greetings and salutations,

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:24.730
you pathetic little humans.

00:14:24.763 --> 00:14:26.599
This village is now mine!

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:28.467
No, wait! Yes!

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.136
Better yet... I'll take
this whole island!

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.371
[FISHMEN yell]

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:36.775
[ARLONG] A hundred thousand
berries for adults

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:39.445
and 50,000 for children.

00:14:39.478 --> 00:14:42.181
Those who cannot pay... die!

00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:45.551
[ARLONG laughing]

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:51.857
[BELLEMERE]
It's okay.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.260
I have to do this for my family.

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:58.264
Even if it costs me my life.

00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:05.905
It's true the three of us
may not be related by blood.

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:08.107
But we're still a family.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.142
All I've ever wanted
to be to those girls

00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:11.810
was their mother.

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:14.213
And now... I can be.

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:15.347
Enough chit-chat.

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:16.815
Now get ready to die.

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:22.788
Nojiko! Nami!

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.026
Love you.

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:31.063
[gunshot]

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:39.939
[ARLONG laughing]

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:42.741
[HACHI]
What's this?

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:43.876
A map, huh?

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:44.843
[NAMI]
No!

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:47.246
That's my map!
I drew it! You can't have it!

00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:49.949
A child drew this?

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:51.884
--Give it back!
--[NOJIKO] Nami, no!

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:54.720
I'm impressed. Good job.

00:15:56.488 --> 00:15:57.990
[ARLONG]
She could be useful.

00:15:58.023 --> 00:15:59.191
Bring her with us.

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:00.359
[HACHI]
Right!

00:16:00.392 --> 00:16:02.962
[NAMI]
No, let go of me! Stop!

00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:06.165
Somebody please help me!

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:08.367
[ARLONG PIRATE A] If humans
want to eat, they have to work!

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.936
Now be a good girl
and keep drawing maps.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.571
[laughs]

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:24.950
[ARLONG] Gather up 100 million
berries and then bring it to me.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.553
Do so and I will let
your village go.

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:30.189
in addition to giving
you your freedom.

00:16:30.222 --> 00:16:31.457
[MAN A]
Get that thief!

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.992
She's got our treasure!

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:34.393
Isn't she just a kid?

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:35.928
I don't care!
Shoot her down!

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.631
[MAN A]
Crap! Find her!

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:40.666
[MAN B]
Right!

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:51.977
[NAMI]
Seventy million.

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:54.546
Only seventy million
more and we'll be free!

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.350
Oh. So, you made
it back after all!

00:16:58.384 --> 00:17:01.353
I guess you have
nowhere else to go.

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:04.556
In that case,
welcome back... navigator!

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:11.463
[ARLONG laughing]

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:23.742
I'm sorry.

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:25.944
You had a truly
horrific experience.

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:28.380
[SANJI] That's right!
And she has you to thank!

00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:30.015
[NAMI]
I did.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.717
It was a nightmare.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.919
Nothing will ever make
me change the way I feel

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:36.722
about Arlong.

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:37.790
That said...

00:17:37.823 --> 00:17:39.525
Until two years ago,

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:42.094
when we made
the trip to Sabaody,

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:44.696
I had no idea that even
the strongest of Fishmen

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.166
were routinely
persecuted by humans.

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:52.805
When Camie was kidnapped
and we tried to save her,

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:54.373
I couldn't believe what I saw.

00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:59.645
There was Sabaody Park,
right in front of me.

00:17:59.678 --> 00:18:03.182
The spitting image of Arlong
Park before it was destroyed.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.156
[HACHI]
We wanted a place all our own.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.992
I'm not saying this to make
you forgive any of us.

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:15.427
But it's true!

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:19.631
Oh, Nami. Arlong...
He really hated humans!

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:22.367
Too much.

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:24.369
[ARLONG]
Heh.

00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:26.705
[HACHI]
Yes. We went too far.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:33.412
But for as long as
I can remember,

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:36.081
we yearned for the world
that the humans lived in.

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:37.249
Above the sea!

00:18:43.188 --> 00:18:47.192
Arlong. Me. All of us.

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:17.089
Our jealousy drove us
to hurt people like you.

00:19:17.122 --> 00:19:17.823
[grunts]

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:19.892
Wait! Take it easy!

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.627
I'll go prep some more medicine.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.228
Please lie down.

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:24.429
[HACHI groans]

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:28.133
I heard...

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:29.801
...my people weren't
considered anything

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.371
more than fish way back when.

00:19:32.404 --> 00:19:35.574
Then 200 years ago,
the Ryugu Kingdom

00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:39.111
became a member country
of the World Government.

00:19:39.144 --> 00:19:42.548
They established friendly
relations with humans,

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:44.550
and their king was even
allowed to participate

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.985
in the World Summit.

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:51.023
But, despite that, humans still
had hate in their hearts.

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:53.825
[DEN] The beginning of
the Great Pirate Era

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:56.528
was probably the
worst time in my life.

00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:58.964
It was hard to be a Fishman.

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:00.799
I vividly remember my fear.

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:03.502
Human pirates running
wild on the island.

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:06.371
Anywhere you went
seemed dangerous.

00:20:06.405 --> 00:20:07.839
So much violence.

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.241
I'll never forget.

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.145
[CROWD yelling]

00:20:13.178 --> 00:20:15.480
[DEN] Our only safe place
in the world was taken over

00:20:15.514 --> 00:20:16.582
by humans.

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:21.019
Then came that fateful day.

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:24.022
Whitebeard arrived on
the island and saved us.

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.224
[PIRATES gasp]

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:28.694
[JIMBEI] He made his
powerful presence felt,

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:31.597
claiming Fishman Island
as his own.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:35.133
Because of him,
peace returned to our home.

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:42.107
However, humans continued to
be prejudiced towards Fishmen.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.911
All of you saw it firsthand
at the Sabaody Archipelago.

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:48.614
That's the cruel reality.

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:54.019
Naturally, once
someone attains power,

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:56.989
they tend to be
resistant to change.

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:58.991
Even though the Government
theoretically bridged

00:20:59.024 --> 00:21:01.994
the gap between
Fishmen and humans,

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:05.364
the worst bigots were the people
in control to begin with.

00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:08.800
The ones who should be
leading by example!

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:10.936
Thus, the relationship
between Fishmen

00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:13.639
and humans remained the same.

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:17.509
Thankfully, two individuals
rose up on Fishman Island.

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:19.611
Individuals who would
help change the course

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:21.780
of our beleaguered history.

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:24.216
The first...

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:27.052
...was Queen Otohime.

00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:29.554
She believed we islanders
could live in harmony

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:30.822
with humans.

00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:33.258
She was Princess
Shirahoshi's mother.

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:37.129
Then there was him,
the legendary hero

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:38.897
named Fisher Tiger.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.832
Who freed countless slaves.

00:21:40.866 --> 00:21:42.734
That Tiger guy, huh?

00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:44.403
Think I've heard
the name before.

00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:47.506
To set himself apart
from the humans,

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:50.008
Tiger broke an unspoken rule.

00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:53.111
Invading the holy land
of Marie Jois by himself,

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.180
and freeing the slaves within.

00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:59.318
He would go on
to form the Sun Pirates.

00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:01.119
Many of its members were Fishmen

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:04.256
who were formerly
slaves of the Nobles.

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:05.357
Sun Pirates?

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:06.358
Indeed!

00:22:06.391 --> 00:22:11.897
You know them as
Arlong, Hachi, and myself.

00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:16.535
The three of us were part
of the very first crew

00:22:16.568 --> 00:22:19.705
of the Sun Pirates.

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:22.841
But we were known
as Fishman Pirates,

00:22:22.874 --> 00:22:24.476
foes of the World Government.

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:26.445
That's all that they saw.

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:29.348
Therefore, we made it
that much more difficult

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:31.016
for Queen Otohime.

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:32.351
Bless her heart.

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:34.686
Our existence prevented
much progress.

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:40.859
Queen Otohime was trying
to navigate great hardships

00:22:40.892 --> 00:22:42.761
and improve our future.

00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:44.396
At the same time,

00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:46.898
Fisher Tiger threw his
future away to save those

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:51.036
of his race who were
suffering as slaves.

00:22:51.069 --> 00:22:53.205
No one can say who
was right or wrong.

00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:59.444
Nevertheless,

00:22:59.478 --> 00:23:03.281
they both fought for a better
future for Fishmen and humans.

00:23:03.315 --> 00:23:04.483
Each one is a legend.

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:09.321
And both of their tales
end in tragedy.

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:16.628
[NARRATOR] Queen Otohime tries
to lead the Ryugu Kingdom

00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:20.098
into an era of coexistence
between humans and Fishmen.

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:22.634
Meanwhile, a heroic Fisher
Tiger battles humans

00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:24.870
to free their slaves
from captivity.

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:27.372
When the tales of these
two historic figures cross,

00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:28.673
for better or for worse,

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:32.244
the fate of Fishman Island
will be immeasurably changed.

00:23:32.277 --> 00:23:33.945
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:37.816
"A Hero Who Freed the Slaves!
An Adventurer Tiger!"

00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:39.684
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
