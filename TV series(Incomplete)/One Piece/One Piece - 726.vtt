WEBVTT

00:02:34.876 --> 00:02:37.314
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.447 --> 00:02:40.086
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.363
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:47.802
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:51.175
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:52.879
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.013 --> 00:02:55.317
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:58.524
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:02.431
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:04.034
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.168 --> 00:03:08.343
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:12.618
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.627 --> 00:03:18.530
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:21.837
and targeted the Don Quixote
Family in Dressrosa.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.876
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.815
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:28.717 --> 00:03:30.621
[NARRATOR] In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:30.754 --> 00:03:32.491
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:34.696
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.270
until at last,
only their leader remained.

00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:40.675
Now, the fate of Dressrosa
will be decided

00:03:40.808 --> 00:03:44.917
in a one-on-one duel between
Luffy and Doflamingo.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.026
So now, all that's left
is to have faith in Straw Hat.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.366
But if he's gonna win,

00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:56.540
then I wanna be there to watch.

00:03:56.674 --> 00:03:58.911
[LUFFY]
Let's go!

00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:04.889
Gum-Gum Grizzly Magnum!

00:04:08.798 --> 00:04:10.000
[DOFLAMINGO]
You're wide open!

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:11.335
[gasps]

00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:16.079
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
There's no place in the world

00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:18.249
where everyone prospers.

00:04:18.382 --> 00:04:20.487
It's a waste of time
trying to save them all.

00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:22.491
You're just a pirate
passing through.

00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:25.396
Why are you trying to play hero?

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:28.135
You dare pick a fight
with me, Straw Hat?

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:29.506
That's not true!

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.043
You're the one
picking a fight with me!

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.820
You made so many
of my friends cry.

00:04:36.953 --> 00:04:39.859
And you made my
crewmates angry, too!

00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:48.042
You'll keep hurting people
until you're stopped.

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:50.113
It's time for me to step up.

00:04:50.247 --> 00:04:53.452
I won't let anyone else die!

00:04:55.056 --> 00:04:59.097
[LUFFY] I'm kicking your ass
and wrecking your Birdcage!

00:05:11.322 --> 00:05:15.063
All right. Fourth Gear!

00:05:40.748 --> 00:05:46.693
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:05.396
[TOWNSWOMAN A gasps]

00:07:05.652 --> 00:07:07.955
[MARINE A]
Go! This way!

00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:16.105
[TOWNSMAN D] We gotta get to
the center of town! Keep going!

00:07:35.744 --> 00:07:37.615
[gasps] Those building
are getting

00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:39.786
dragged across the ground.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.235
[TOWNSMAN E] And they're
coming straight for us! Run!

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.509
The kingdom's getting
crushed into a ball,

00:07:51.643 --> 00:07:53.580
and us along with it!

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:07.875
[SAI]
The Birdcage is shrinking.

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:10.781
[CHIN JAO] That would
explain the mass panic.

00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:14.689
The Birdcage buries everything.

00:08:14.822 --> 00:08:16.860
Now the whole kingdom
knows the truth.

00:08:16.993 --> 00:08:19.800
That the Young Master's
rule was all a lie.

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:22.972
He can't control
the people anymore.

00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:25.477
So he's going to
kill them instead.

00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:26.913
He'll erase and entire kingdom

00:08:27.047 --> 00:08:30.153
without a moment's
hesitation, honey.

00:08:31.455 --> 00:08:32.658
This is a nightmare.

00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:35.463
I see the battle isn't over yet.

00:08:36.198 --> 00:08:38.537
[BABY 5 squeals]
I called him "honey" again!

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:39.906
This is really happening!

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.612
Married life is
off to a great start!

00:08:42.745 --> 00:08:44.582
I'm not gonna sit here
picking my nose,

00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:46.586
waiting for death to come!

00:08:46.719 --> 00:08:48.558
Go find our fallen allies!

00:08:48.691 --> 00:08:49.926
Get them back up!

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.397
[ORLUMBUS]
All right!

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:56.774
Oh. He's taking control already.

00:08:56.907 --> 00:08:58.677
If he can handle
these tough characters,

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.413
he'll make a fine leader.

00:09:00.548 --> 00:09:02.351
[BABY 5]
And a fine husband!

00:09:02.484 --> 00:09:06.359
I've really gotta
step it up as a homemaker!

00:09:06.492 --> 00:09:08.196
[VIOLET] If the battle
goes on for too long,

00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:10.702
even this plateau
will be cut to pieces.

00:09:10.835 --> 00:09:12.237
[USOPP]
What?

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.741
I thought this was
the middle of the kingdom!

00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:15.476
Isn't it the safest place?

00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:17.682
Look above.

00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:20.554
The center is
slowly moving, too.

00:09:20.688 --> 00:09:22.157
[USOPP]
Huh?

00:09:23.026 --> 00:09:24.796
[VIOLET] It's probably
closing in on the royal palace

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.499
on top of the plateau.

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:30.440
In other words, where Doflamingo
is fighting right now.

00:09:30.574 --> 00:09:32.244
Unless we push
towards the center,

00:09:32.377 --> 00:09:34.816
we'll be shredded
like everything else.

00:09:36.352 --> 00:09:40.059
[USOPP screams] Climb faster,
climb faster, climb faster...

00:09:40.193 --> 00:09:41.362
Don't shake me!

00:09:41.495 --> 00:09:42.898
Climb faster, go!

00:09:46.873 --> 00:09:48.577
Now that we're
in the midst of it,

00:09:48.711 --> 00:09:51.716
I see that things
are quite chaotic!

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:52.652
This way.

00:09:52.785 --> 00:09:55.157
Huh? Sir Zoro!

00:09:56.225 --> 00:09:58.830
[KIN'EMON] Might I inquire
where you're going, Sir Zoro?

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:00.935
What do you mean?
Isn't it obvious?

00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:02.471
[KANJURO, KIN'EMON]
Huh?

00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:06.747
We're going to
stop that thing. There.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.249
[BOTH]
Where?

00:10:10.788 --> 00:10:14.327
[BOTH]
No!

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.108
What a surprise.

00:10:21.242 --> 00:10:24.815
I never knew there were
little people here in Dressrosa.

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:27.589
And their princess can
heal injuries like magic.

00:10:27.722 --> 00:10:30.027
It's practically a fairy tale.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.932
I hope your arm
turns out all right.

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:34.569
They said it should be
back in working order

00:10:34.703 --> 00:10:36.840
once the blood flow returns.

00:10:36.973 --> 00:10:40.246
[LAW]
Yeah, I know. I'm a doctor.

00:10:40.948 --> 00:10:43.152
When I saw that
underground port,

00:10:43.285 --> 00:10:45.323
one thing became clear.

00:10:57.246 --> 00:11:00.153
[CAVENDISH] This is much
bigger than one man.

00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:04.027
Even if we defeat Doflamingo,
the battle won't be over.

00:11:05.363 --> 00:11:08.737
But it will cause ripples
across the world.

00:11:09.605 --> 00:11:13.045
[CAVENDISH] And all eyes
will be on you and Straw Hat.

00:11:14.682 --> 00:11:18.122
Yeah. That was the plan.

00:11:36.593 --> 00:11:39.097
"Fourth Gear"? Do tell.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.968
[LUFFY]
That's right.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.642
[LUFFY] I gotta kick
your ass in a hurry,

00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:47.247
so I need to get stronger.

00:11:50.487 --> 00:11:54.729
[LUFFY] It's nothing
like Second or Third.

00:12:10.828 --> 00:12:13.667
[LUFFY]
Muscle Balloon!

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.835
[DOFLAMINGO]
Hm?

00:12:48.637 --> 00:12:53.546
Fourth Gear!

00:13:00.293 --> 00:13:03.933
Bounce-Man!

00:13:08.644 --> 00:13:12.551
[chuckles]

00:13:12.685 --> 00:13:16.592
[DOFLAMINGO cackling]

00:13:16.726 --> 00:13:19.965
[DOFLAMINGO] I'm sorry.
Is this supposed to be joke?

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:22.772
You certainly got big,
I'll give you that much.

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:25.511
But you think
a balloon scares me?

00:13:26.378 --> 00:13:27.782
[DOFLAMINGO]
And here I thought you had

00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:29.785
some secret strategy
to win this.

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:31.723
You should take
things seriously!

00:13:31.857 --> 00:13:35.263
I am serious. You wanna see?

00:13:35.396 --> 00:13:38.002
[DOFLAMINGO] What are you going
to do, bounce me to death?

00:13:38.136 --> 00:13:40.841
You can't even stand on
your own two feet anymore.

00:13:40.974 --> 00:13:42.645
How are you supposed
to kick my ass

00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:45.016
with a stupid power like that?

00:13:45.149 --> 00:13:48.088
For two whole years,

00:13:48.222 --> 00:13:52.197
I fought against wild animals
as huge and savage

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.302
as any monster
you could think of.

00:13:57.608 --> 00:13:59.512
[LUFFY yells]

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.526
[LUFFY] If I wanted to
wrestle them to the ground,

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:12.003
I needed greater size
and greater bounciness.

00:14:15.544 --> 00:14:18.315
And what good does
elasticity do?

00:14:23.026 --> 00:14:25.129
[LUFFY]
Shut up.

00:14:27.768 --> 00:14:30.875
[LUFFY]
Once I start,

00:14:31.008 --> 00:14:33.947
you won't even be
able to fight back.

00:14:38.623 --> 00:14:42.531
Now, my Gum-Gum...

00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:44.568
...Kong...

00:14:48.375 --> 00:14:49.477
...Gun!

00:15:48.696 --> 00:15:50.266
What's going on now?

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.604
Something fell from the sky.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.423
What happened?

00:16:02.558 --> 00:16:04.261
[VIOLET]
I can't believe it.

00:16:04.394 --> 00:16:08.135
[USOPP] Huh? You can't
believe what? Is Luffy okay?

00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:10.140
He transformed.

00:16:10.273 --> 00:16:12.845
I've never seen
anything like this before.

00:16:12.978 --> 00:16:14.448
And Doflamingo is...

00:16:14.582 --> 00:16:15.650
[gasps]

00:16:18.222 --> 00:16:20.326
It's Doflamingo!

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.696
[TOWNSWOMAN B]
What?

00:16:28.408 --> 00:16:34.788
[DOFLAMINGO panting]

00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:39.565
Everyone stand back!

00:16:39.699 --> 00:16:43.005
Don't move! What the hell
are you doing here?

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:48.215
I'd like to know that myself.

00:16:52.658 --> 00:16:55.564
[TOWNSMAN K]
Run! He's gonna kill us!

00:16:55.697 --> 00:16:57.367
[TOWNSMAN L]
There's nowhere to go!

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.672
We'll end up
hitting the Birdcage!

00:17:09.592 --> 00:17:11.428
[DOFLAMINGO]
This is downtown.

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:14.334
He really knocked me a long way.

00:17:20.514 --> 00:17:25.757
[thumping]

00:17:33.673 --> 00:17:36.812
[DOFLAMINGO]
He's using elastic force to fly?

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.329
Try this, balloon boy! Overheat!

00:17:51.876 --> 00:17:54.213
This one's my Gum-Gum...

00:17:56.686 --> 00:17:59.457
[LUFFY]
...Rhino Schneider!

00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:09.545
Somebody else showed up!

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:13.185
He's massive! And it
looks like he's strong, too!

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:32.824
[TOWNSMAN O]
He's a giant ball man?

00:18:34.327 --> 00:18:37.467
[USOPP]
Viola. Is he winning, or what?

00:18:37.601 --> 00:18:38.803
Unreal.

00:18:38.936 --> 00:18:41.976
M-M-M-M-M-Mister Luffy!

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.947
Heck yeah!

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.051
What is that? A new technique?

00:18:46.185 --> 00:18:49.391
Yeah, it's gotta be! Woohoo!

00:18:49.525 --> 00:18:52.163
Hey, you realize how
awesome this is, Stumpy?

00:18:52.296 --> 00:18:54.034
We got to witness
a never-before seen

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:56.305
super-secret
special move in person

00:18:56.438 --> 00:18:58.576
and you're just standing
there like a statue!

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.147
[BARTOLOMEO gasping]
I can't stop shaking,

00:19:01.281 --> 00:19:02.851
this is the best day of my life!

00:19:02.985 --> 00:19:04.187
Move.

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:07.259
He's so strong.

00:19:17.648 --> 00:19:19.819
[DOFLAMINGO]
Little bastard!

00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:22.591
He's hardening his skin
with Armament Haki

00:19:22.725 --> 00:19:25.062
and using the tensile force
to multiply his strength

00:19:25.195 --> 00:19:27.266
several times over.

00:19:31.341 --> 00:19:33.345
I'm not gonna lose to a ball!

00:19:33.478 --> 00:19:35.683
I'm stronger than rubber!

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:02.370
What is that pose?

00:20:02.504 --> 00:20:04.742
I'm so sick of this crap!

00:20:13.527 --> 00:20:15.663
Pentachromatic String!

00:20:17.968 --> 00:20:19.437
Bullet String!

00:20:24.815 --> 00:20:26.552
[LUFFY]
I told you, didn't I?

00:20:26.686 --> 00:20:30.392
Now that I'm using Fourth Gear,
you can't keep up.

00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:35.402
This is the end.

00:20:36.237 --> 00:20:38.643
Here I come, Mingo.

00:20:38.777 --> 00:20:41.682
Who the hell do you
think you're dealing with?

00:20:45.055 --> 00:20:46.024
[grunts]

00:20:50.567 --> 00:20:53.305
[LUFFY grunts]

00:20:56.311 --> 00:20:57.446
[DOFLAMINGO groans]

00:21:02.189 --> 00:21:04.828
[LUFFY grunts]

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:10.707
Now, Gum-Gum...

00:21:15.884 --> 00:21:17.787
...Culverin!

00:21:22.163 --> 00:21:23.498
[DOFLAMINGO]
Athlete!

00:21:30.312 --> 00:21:33.753
[DOFLAMINGO] Even with the
armor, he's still like rubber!

00:21:33.887 --> 00:21:39.330
[LUFFY] You think that's
gonna work on me? Not now!

00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:42.571
I can't believe this!

00:21:42.705 --> 00:21:44.775
Don't you dare try and run away.

00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:47.446
You're gonna get
that ass-kicking!

00:21:50.152 --> 00:21:53.593
[DOFLAMINGO] What's happening?
It keeps going!

00:21:56.331 --> 00:21:58.669
Chase him down! Python!

00:21:59.938 --> 00:22:01.074
Damn it!

00:22:05.883 --> 00:22:07.186
[yells]

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.090
How far can his arm stretch?

00:22:09.223 --> 00:22:15.102
[yells]

00:22:21.214 --> 00:22:23.118
Enough! Eat this!

00:22:24.287 --> 00:22:27.594
And now, Gum-Gum...

00:22:34.074 --> 00:22:35.544
...Culverin!

00:22:35.677 --> 00:22:38.415
[LUFFY grunts]

00:23:14.688 --> 00:23:16.726
[NARRATOR] Luffy's unrelenting
assault with Fourth Gear

00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:18.829
seems to make
quick work of Doflamingo.

00:23:18.963 --> 00:23:21.301
But the wicked king isn't ready
to give up Dressrosa yet

00:23:21.434 --> 00:23:24.508
and counterattacks with a
surprise technique of his own.

00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:26.813
Taking Luffy by surprise,
he summons forth

00:23:26.946 --> 00:23:29.651
a mysterious new kind
of Devil Fruit power.

00:23:29.785 --> 00:23:31.522
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.656 --> 00:23:35.296
"A Massive Counterattack!
Doflamingo's Awakening!"

00:23:35.429 --> 00:23:38.068
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
