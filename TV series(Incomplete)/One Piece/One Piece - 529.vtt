WEBVTT

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:05.105
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.910
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.246
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.414
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.515
You can have it!

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.385
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.653
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.723
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.526
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.892
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece,

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:41.861
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:47.100
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.235
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.603
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.906
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.741
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:57.177
this has proven
to be the end of road.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.612
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:02.882
[NARRATOR]
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:05.118
a boy whose body became
rubber after eating

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:08.087
the Gum-Gum Fruit,
sets sail into the New World

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.889
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:13.927
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.331
[NARRATOR] In the two
years that have passed

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.533
since the War of the
Best in Marineford

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:23.102
the Straw Hat Pirates underwent
special training before

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:25.939
returning to the
Sabaody Archipelago.

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:28.341
Now, in order to progress
to the New World,

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.910
Luffy and his crew have
arrived at Fishman Island,

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:33.513
thousands of feet
below sea level.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:37.016
However, they were attacked
by the New Fishman Pirates,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.353
causing them to become
separated yet again.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:43.389
[NARRATOR] In this time of need,
mermaids managed to rescue

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:46.626
some of the crew and bring
them safely to Camie's home.

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:52.465
[ISHILLY screams]
No! What did I do?

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:55.101
We don't have time!
Guys, this is serious!

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:58.004
Please, I'm begging you!
Whatever it takes!

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:00.707
I can't let my friend die!

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:06.012
[LUFFY] "The Fishman Island
Will Be Annihilated?!

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.981
Sharley's Prophecy!"

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:12.719
[LUFFY] We need help!
My friend is dying!

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.420
Can anyone give him blood?

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:18.191
Human or fishman!
S RH negative is his type!

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:21.728
He doesn't have much time!
Please, we're begging you!

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.429
[GROUP]
Help him!

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:28.468
[FISHMEN, MERFOLK murmuring]

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:33.940
Poor thing. I'm sorry.

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:37.577
This is a bad place for a human
to get a blood transfusion.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.912
But, I'm sure Luffy- chin
and your friends

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.814
will figure something out!

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:46.419
[LUFFY panting]

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:47.420
Damn it!

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.355
No matter who we ask,
there isn't anyone here

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.457
who'll give him blood! C'mon!

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.394
[USOPP] I refuse to give up!
Sanji's counting on us!

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:56.729
There's gotta be somebody!

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.135
All right! Luffy!

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:04.804
I found some humans here!

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:07.907
[MERMAIDS giggling]

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.547
Hey, that barrel over there
is the one that drifted

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.382
in with all Camie's
friends, right?

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:19.118
What's in it? Maybe treasure?

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.720
Uh... I don't know.

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:24.090
It's sealed pretty tightly,
so it's gotta be important.

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:27.026
Yeah? I think we should open it.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.562
Me, too. What if it
needs to go in the fridge?

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:32.632
Good point.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.101
Wow. Talk about well-prepared.

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:36.436
Way to go!

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.072
[MERMAIDS laugh]

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:46.979
[SANJI grunting]

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.315
Hey, Sanji! Are you awake?

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.516
Talk to us.

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:54.020
Where am I?

00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:57.056
[CHOPPER sighs]
You pulled through!

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.258
We're safe in a town
right by the harbor.

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:00.727
I was scared.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.663
You almost lost all
the blood in your body.

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:04.864
I was starting to think

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:08.601
we'd never find you a donor.
That was a real close call.

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:10.903
That so? Wow.

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:15.742
What in the hell happened to me?

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:17.810
[CAMIE] You shouldn't be
sitting up so quickly!

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:19.278
You need to rest!

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.680
I just don't get it.

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.815
I mean, the fish
could've given blood.

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.917
But, no, instead we had
to run all over town

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:28.154
looking for another human,
which took forever!

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:29.088
I know. Right?

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:30.923
I was starting
to lose hope there.

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:31.824
[SANJI]
I'm sorry.

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:34.360
I appreciate what
you did, though.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.230
But, I just don't remember much.

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:38.498
Why'd this happen?

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:40.633
Where was I, and
what was I doing?

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:42.335
When I think about it,
it's all a big blur.

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:43.169
[GROUP gasps]

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:44.270
--[LUFFY yells]
--[USOPP] No!

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:45.772
[BOTH]
Let it go already!

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:49.175
If you try to force the
memories, you could relapse!

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:51.711
Oh, yeah! I almost
forgot, Sanji.

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:53.346
You haven't met your donors.

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:57.083
So here. Say, "hi."
And also "thank you."

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:02.188
Wait.

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:06.359
Could my savior have
been a dainty girl?

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.965
[VOICE 529A laughs]
Don't worry. We're only human.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:17.537
After all, if we don't look out
for each other, who will?

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:23.342
Don't worry, babe.

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:24.477
If you want...

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.946
[BOTH]
...we can give you more!

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:35.888
[SANJI screams]

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:40.293
[laughs] Looks like he's
back to his old self!

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:41.627
[gasps]

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:44.697
[USOPP]
That's not exactly gratitude.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.832
Luffy.

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:48.201
Can I see the cut on your
arm for a second, please?

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:49.702
[LUFFY]
Uh?

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.075
It's positive. Thought so.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:58.511
Luffy. That wound's poisonous!

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:00.379
Oh, wow. Really?

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:02.949
That musta been the
sting I felt earlier.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.718
One of the fishmen got me.

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.253
[USOPP]
You don't seem poisoned.

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:08.621
You feeling okay?

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:09.622
Yeah!

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:12.225
[CHOPPER] Either way,
we should be careful.

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:15.394
This stuff's probably deadly.
You sure you're all right?

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:16.062
[LUFFY]
Yup.

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:17.830
Wow. So weird.

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:20.533
It sounds crazy, but you
must have somehow developed

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:23.669
an antibody to fight against
this kind of stuff.

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:24.904
Tell me.

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:27.673
Have you ever experienced a
poisoning like this in the past?

00:08:27.707 --> 00:08:29.242
Let's see...

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:34.947
[LUFFY] Yeah, back when
I was at Impel Down,

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.750
I almost got killed that way.

00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:39.719
[laughs]

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:42.955
That is not funny! At all.

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:45.157
Yeah! It is!

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.593
I bet it was that
octopus swordsman.

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:51.163
I mean, he blocked my punch.
So he's gotta be strong.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.900
No prob. Next time,
I'll be ready.

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:00.740
[MERMAIDS scream]

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:02.842
Huh?

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:05.111
They're so loud.

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:08.548
I think that came
from by that cove.

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:11.317
Don't care. I've got
bigger problems.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.220
These guys are
messed up real bad.

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:18.791
And what's worse,
Straw Hat got poisoned, too.

00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:21.093
I'm dead if he dies. [hiccups]

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:27.166
I'm positive I heard their
screams come from here.

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:28.734
Ishilly!

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:31.237
[SORA, KAIREN]
Where are you?

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.172
[SEIRA]
This is where I saw them last.

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:35.041
But where in the world
could they have gone?

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.642
[ADELE] Did anyone else
hear them say something

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.544
about opening up a barrel?

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:45.217
[CAMIE] Hey, Luffy- chin ,
Usopp- chin , come here.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.652
There's someone I'd
like you to meet.

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:47.753
[LUFFY, USOPP]
Huh?

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:52.124
She's the owner of this place.

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:54.727
--She okayed Sanji resting here.
--[LUFFY] Look at this thing!

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.596
The Madam Sharley.

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:58.164
[LUFFY]
Cool, thanks and stuff.

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:02.635
[SHARLEY chuckles] Has the blond
boy's condition improved at all?

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:03.903
[CAMIE]
Yup!

00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:06.505
But it's best he doesn't meet
you because you're so beautiful.

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:08.407
Right? That would be bad.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.109
Also, we probably
shouldn't tell him

00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:12.678
he's in the back
of the Mermaid Café.

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:14.447
Not if we want him to get well.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.215
[SHARLEY]
Why keep it a secret?

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:17.717
'Cause doctor's orders!

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.119
Chopper's pretty sure that
if Sanji- chin finds out,

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:21.921
he's gonna have a bad relapse.

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:25.157
What a strange prognosis.

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:27.860
[LUFFY]
Hey, big lady. Fish lady!

00:10:27.893 --> 00:10:30.429
Wow. That was rude. Come on.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.564
Tell me what this is!

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:32.865
It's beautiful!

00:10:32.898 --> 00:10:34.900
[SHARLEY] It's also not
on the list of things

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:36.902
you're allowed to touch.

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:37.903
Oh, that?

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:40.506
You're looking at Madam
Sharley's crystal ball.

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:42.174
With it, she can see the future.

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:45.911
Her precognitive visions
are why she's famous.

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:48.414
Well, it used to be.
Not anymore.

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:49.682
[gasps]

00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:57.990
The future isn't ours
to know. Right?

00:10:58.024 --> 00:10:58.991
Sounds rough.

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:01.861
Oh, by the way, how do
mermaids take a dump?

00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:04.363
We are not talking about
mermaid poop again!

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:06.666
Don't you have any class?

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:09.335
Guys, apologize! Quickly!

00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:10.970
[BOTH]
Sorry.

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:14.407
[SHARLEY] Why don't you take
the rest of the day off, Camie.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.677
I think your friends would
appreciate a tour of the island.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.378
Really? You sure?

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:20.579
[SHARLEY]
It's fine.

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:23.949
You deserve it, seeing as
you're always working so hard.

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:25.418
Besides, business has been slow

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:27.720
with human guests so
uncommon these days.

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:30.256
So we have to be
extra good hosts.

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:32.291
The girls from the cove
should show up soon.

00:11:32.324 --> 00:11:35.027
Then we'll have more hands
around here than a starfish.

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:38.597
"More than... starfish?"
Oh, that's right! Crap!

00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:42.535
I should have already delivered
Pappagu's clams by now!

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:44.904
Wow. I have no idea
what's going on.

00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:48.274
I bet he's getting mad
waiting for his food.

00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:50.843
Not quite. He's
enjoying the café.

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:53.212
An old friend of his
suddenly came into town,

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:55.414
and they've been living
it up since he arrived.

00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:56.816
Wait, he's here?

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:59.318
[BOTH]
Well, that makes things easy.

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:06.859
[CAMIE] I didn't wanna bring
this up in front of her,

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:08.394
but Madam told me
a lot of stories

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:10.429
from when she was little.

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:11.664
She said, in those days,

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:14.433
human pirates came to
the island all the time.

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.402
But that was quite a while ago.

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:19.071
About a year before the
Great Pirate Era began.

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:21.240
[BOTH yelp]

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:23.776
[CAMIE] It's hard for her to
talk about things sometimes.

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:25.845
Especially when she
foresees bad stuff,

00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:28.447
like the war at Marineford
and Whitebeard's death.

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:30.449
[LUFFY, USOPP]
What?!

00:12:30.483 --> 00:12:32.752
[CAMIE] Can you imagine knowing
something horrible will happen

00:12:32.785 --> 00:12:33.886
that you can't stop?

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:35.621
[USOPP]
That must be terrifying!

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:36.989
[LUFFY]
Hey, where's Chopper?

00:12:37.022 --> 00:12:38.924
[USOPP] Oh, he said he
was gonna hang out here

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:39.892
and look after Sanji.

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.660
[CAMIE]
C'mon, you two! Hurry up!

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:42.895
[USOPP, LUFFY]
'Kay!

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.166
Right now, we're on
what's considered

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:48.968
Coral Hill's main street.

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:52.238
And that is the primary
entrance to the Mermaid Café.

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:54.306
[USOPP, LUFFY laugh]

00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:58.544
Man! Thought I was
gonna starve to death!

00:12:58.577 --> 00:13:00.346
They might only serve snacks.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:01.747
No. You're good.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.716
We've got cakes and
sea fruit, too.

00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:05.084
[LUFFY]
And meat?

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:06.018
Uh, no.

00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:08.988
We merfolk don't really
eat meat and fish.

00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:13.192
But we have Wakame Brûlée,
Mozuku Tarts, Kelp Soufflé...

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:15.261
You call that food?

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:18.264
Wait! We do have some meat!

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:19.331
From shellfish!

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:22.001
Scallop Sandwiches,
Clam Pizza, and--

00:13:22.034 --> 00:13:23.569
Those give meat a bad name!

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:24.970
Stop! Talking!

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:27.206
Whoa. Okay. Be cool.

00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:28.574
Let's just go inside.

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:30.676
Yeah. Let's all
go find Pappagu.

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.179
Shellfish! What the hell
kind of crap is that?

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.613
[MERMAIDS]
Thank you very much!

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:35.981
[PAPPAGU]
Yeah!

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:37.850
[GROUP gasps]

00:13:37.883 --> 00:13:40.219
[BROOK]
Time to give the dogfish a bone!

00:13:40.252 --> 00:13:44.056
Gotta love the fans, huh?

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:01.607
[BROOK laughs]

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.942
[BOTH]
Oh, wow, it's Brook!

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:04.109
Hooray!

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:06.745
Huh? Luffy and Usopp!

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:09.648
And Camie, you've become
such a lovely young lady.

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.483
Now, may I please
see your panties.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.085
Mermaids don't wear those!

00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:15.054
Hey, guys!

00:14:15.087 --> 00:14:16.956
You have no idea how
much I've missed you!

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:18.324
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:20.659
Hey, Pappagu! Sorry
it's been so long!

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.863
I guess that makes you Pappagu's
"old friend" we heard about.

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:28.634
Yes. Though, I wish the reunion
had better circumstances.

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:30.903
'Cause without him, I'd be sunk!

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:31.971
[laughs]

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:33.138
[PAPPAGU]
Don't let the laugh fool you--

00:14:33.172 --> 00:14:34.406
he means that literally.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.408
There I was, hard at
work by the cove,

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:39.211
finalizing a design idea I had,
when all of a sudden,

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:41.780
a pile of bones went
drifting by on a log!

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:43.082
Huh?

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.852
[PAPPAGU screams]
Bone Daddy!

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.454
[BROOK laughs]

00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:50.623
Come see us again! 'Kay?

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:54.693
I had a great time, Soul King!

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:57.963
[laughs] I'll be back,
lovely ladies!

00:14:57.997 --> 00:14:59.832
Lots of bones to go around!

00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:00.866
What?!

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.134
I've gone limp!

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:04.603
[BROOK yelps]

00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:08.140
No I haven't. Ha!
Skeletons are always rigid!

00:15:08.173 --> 00:15:10.576
Ah, good thing I'm already dead,

00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:13.112
or I would probably die
of embarrassment right now!

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.847
[MERMAIDS]
Oh, you!

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.716
This café has really
put Brook in rare form.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.252
Yeah, whatever's goin' on
inside must be awesome!

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:21.854
Hold up there, boss!

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:22.922
[LUFFY, USOPP]
Huh?

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:24.723
[PAPPAGU]
What're ya in such a hurry for?

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:27.426
I know you're interested
in the café, and I get that,

00:15:27.459 --> 00:15:29.194
but it's not like
it's going anywhere.

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:31.430
Let's come back when
you have your whole crew.

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:34.333
Bone-Daddy and I were just
about to head back to my place.

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:37.069
Why don't you guys come with us?

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:40.372
If you do, you can eat all
the sea king meat you want!

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:42.474
Did you say "meat?"

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:46.245
Yeah, I did! I'm a
wild animal! Ya feel me?

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.247
It's not like I eat
boring shellfish.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.349
I need food with
a little more bite.

00:15:50.382 --> 00:15:52.117
Sea monster exclusive diet!

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:54.153
Oh! By the way,

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:55.521
I brought your order of clams!

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:58.357
Sweet! My favorite
treat is finally here!

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.426
[USOPP]
Ha! So much for your diet!

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.461
Oh, man!

00:16:02.494 --> 00:16:05.364
[SANJI groans]

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.868
Beautiful Mermaid.

00:16:09.902 --> 00:16:11.837
[BLOND DONOR]
Yes?

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.305
[yells]

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:18.644
Lovely Mermaids. So sweet!

00:16:19.778 --> 00:16:21.747
[BOTH]
You okay, hun?

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.482
[screams]

00:16:23.515 --> 00:16:26.485
This sucks. Hope they're
having better luck.

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:31.223
Look, Merfolk are the only
ones who don't eat meat.

00:16:31.256 --> 00:16:32.992
Fishmen eat the stuff
all the time!

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:34.493
So it's not like you
can't get it here,

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:36.228
it's just not as common.

00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:37.930
[LUFFY]
Yes! That's great!

00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:40.032
[PAPPAGU] Man, it's about
time one of them showed up.

00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:41.467
Hey, taxi!

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:46.405
Hey. Wait a minute!

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:50.876
[gasps] Vander Decken!
Thought so!

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:53.345
But why is there a wanted
poster for a ghost?

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:54.313
[USOPP]
Yeah!

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:57.182
Wasn't this guy on the
haunted ship we saw?

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:58.917
You saw him? For real?

00:16:58.951 --> 00:16:59.852
[BROOK]
Uh-huh.

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:01.153
No way! Whoa!

00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:03.789
Our nation's been looking
for him for years now!

00:17:03.822 --> 00:17:06.825
The dude's a pirate and
a no-good undersea thief.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.660
I'll tell you all
about it on the trip.

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:10.696
Let's load up and go!

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:21.740
Story goes, Vander
Decken was hard up.

00:17:21.774 --> 00:17:23.342
The guy was totally
head-over-heels

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:25.778
for the Mermaid Princess
of the Ryugu Kingdom.

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:28.480
He was so desperate,
he sent love letters daily.

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:31.550
Stalkery, y'know?

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:34.753
Gave up letters. Started sending
gifts instead. Then threats.

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:36.388
--Wanted to marry her.
--[BOTH] ...so soft and fluffy!

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:37.322
Feels great!

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:40.259
And springy! Bouncy! Bouncy!

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:42.127
[PAPPAGU]
Are you even listening to me?

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:43.595
[USOPP, LUFFY]
Sure!

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:44.797
Sorry about that.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.167
Ahem. Because his advances
started to become so violent,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.002
the Mermaid Princess got scared.

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:53.705
And so of course, the stalker
became a national concern!

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.208
Yeah! But that was
just the beginning!

00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:58.510
Her father,
King Neptune, got mad,

00:17:58.544 --> 00:18:01.113
which led to him sending the
three princes you saw earlier

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:02.714
off to hunt Vander Decken.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:05.584
But even with the army,
they can't find him.

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:09.254
Oh, c'mon, Camie.
You stole all my thunder.

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:11.690
By the way! King Neptune's
the God of the Sea!

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.659
Plus he's in control
of this country.

00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:15.561
If that's not enough
responsibility,

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.863
he has four children
to take care of!

00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:20.032
The Mermaid Princess
is the youngest,

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:22.434
so, obviously, the three
princes are the older kids

00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:23.769
in the royal family.

00:18:23.802 --> 00:18:25.871
Please. I got this.

00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:28.974
Great. But, something
still doesn't make sense.

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:30.943
[LUFFY]
What's goin' on down there?

00:18:30.976 --> 00:18:34.246
If he isn't a ghost, I imagine
he's a few hundred years old.

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.481
At least!

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.216
[PAPPAGU]
Huh. You're right,

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:38.617
that doesn't make sense.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.887
That is, unless,
you ignore the rumors.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.989
Now there's no denying
that he existed.

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:46.658
But the truth of the matter is
that the legendary sea captain

00:18:46.692 --> 00:18:49.528
Vander Decken died sometime
after he arrived here

00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:53.332
on Fishman Island and hasn't
been heard from since.

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:55.367
That said, the ship
you say you saw

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.504
probably was the
Flying Dutchman , but...

00:18:59.738 --> 00:19:02.074
It's his descendant
who's on board!

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:04.209
He's--!

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:06.345
He's Vander Decken the Ninth!

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:10.449
Wow! That's a lot!

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:11.650
Well, I have to say,

00:19:11.683 --> 00:19:14.319
it's a relief to find out
he's not a ghost after all.

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:16.121
Believing we had come
into contact with someone

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:19.358
from the afterlife was making me
contemplate my own mortality.

00:19:19.391 --> 00:19:22.528
And considering I'm a skeleton,
I don't have much of that left.

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:25.330
I just wanted to tell
an exciting story.

00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:28.167
Man. I thought
Merfolk and Fishmen

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.869
all looked the same, but the
more I see, the less they do.

00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:32.671
[USOPP] Check out those
old ones down there!

00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:35.140
Their fins are split
like Granny Kokoro!

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.109
See those babies?
Right there.

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:38.177
[LUFFY, USOPP]
Huh?

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.878
[PAPPAGU] You'll notice
the father is a Fishman,

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:42.581
but the children are
a mix of both species.

00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:44.550
That's because when
a Mermaid and a Fishman

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:47.252
love each other very much
and decide to get busy,

00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:50.355
their kids can come out
looking like either parent.

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:53.559
Bam. Four possibilities
for the happy family.

00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:56.195
Oh. That's why they
all look different.

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:57.930
So cool!

00:19:57.963 --> 00:20:00.832
All right, we finally
made it to the highway!

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:08.707
[LUFFY] Whoa! This is fast!
What's up with that place?

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.976
[PAPPAGU] Oh. Nothing,
it's a candy factory.

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:11.810
[LUFFY]
Really?

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:13.845
Then why's there
a pirate flag on it?

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.014
Oh, that? That flag's
everywhere here.

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:18.884
By the entrance and the
harbor. It's a big deal!

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:20.352
And for good reason at that.

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:22.988
It symbolizes that
we're protected.

00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:25.657
Y'see, the flag belongs
to a famous pirate

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:27.993
named Charlotte Linlin
of the New World.

00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:31.697
But she's better known as Big
Mom, one of the Four Emperors!

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.365
Whoa. That's no joke.

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:36.001
Ah. Back before
the War in Marineford,

00:20:36.034 --> 00:20:37.769
Whitebeard was this
island's guardian,

00:20:37.803 --> 00:20:40.606
but now that he's dead, someone
else had to take his place.

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:43.075
And that someone
happened to be her.

00:20:43.108 --> 00:20:44.876
Okay.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.579
[PAPPAGU] The thing is, she
demands a whole ton of candy

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:49.615
in exchange for her services.

00:20:49.648 --> 00:20:51.783
Hence the factory
that you just saw.

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:53.185
That's weird.

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:55.020
This country wouldn't
be able to survive

00:20:55.053 --> 00:20:57.422
without the protection of
powerful people like her.

00:20:57.456 --> 00:21:00.158
After all, this is a dangerous
place where pirates come and go,

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:02.961
and more often than not,
they aren't very friendly.

00:21:02.995 --> 00:21:04.029
Yeah, I guess.

00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:06.231
Plus, she's filling in
where Whitebeard left off,

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:08.934
so that's gotta mean she's
a good person, doesn't it?

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:10.502
[PAPPAGU]
Depends on how you look at it.

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:12.004
Whitebeard never
asked for anything

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:13.639
in return for his protection.

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:14.740
Big Mom, on the other hand,

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:17.009
treats it like a business
rather than a charity.

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:18.777
Still. That's cool.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.813
An Emperor. Like Shanks! Crazy!

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:23.415
Hope I get to meet her.

00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:25.117
Eyes forward!

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.419
This is where all the
celebrity-types live:

00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:30.389
Fishverly Hills!

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:32.824
[CAMIE] That tall building right
in front is Pappagu's house,

00:21:32.858 --> 00:21:34.493
where we're going!

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:37.696
[GROUP]
All that for one starfish?

00:21:40.265 --> 00:21:43.535
[SHARLEY screams]

00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:45.304
We have to do something!

00:21:45.337 --> 00:21:47.172
We can't let this happen!

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:50.175
That's Madam Sharley
from the café.

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:52.711
What's the matter?
Please. Please tell us.

00:21:52.744 --> 00:21:54.713
What's wrong? Why are you upset?

00:21:54.746 --> 00:21:57.983
Something must be done.
Now, before it's too late!

00:21:58.016 --> 00:22:00.285
Uh. Sure. What do we do?

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.587
[SHARLEY panting]

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:05.857
[SHARLEY] Find him!
The pirate boy in a straw hat!

00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:09.127
It's an emergency!

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:10.762
He must leave the country!

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:12.597
Now! There's no time!

00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:14.700
Wait. You're having
a premonition?

00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:16.935
I swore I wouldn't
use this power.

00:22:16.968 --> 00:22:19.504
But something about
that boy felt off to me.

00:22:19.538 --> 00:22:23.675
I... I had no choice
but to look into the future!

00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:28.046
What's going to happen?
Tell us! What did you see?

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.915
[MERMAID 529A]
We have to know!

00:22:29.948 --> 00:22:32.184
Sharley! Tell us!

00:22:32.217 --> 00:22:33.151
[FISHMAN 529AA]
Madam!

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:35.287
[FISHMAN 529BB]
Please!

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.957
I hope I'm wrong,
and that it won't happen!

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:42.160
[gasps]

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:59.611
[SHARLEY] I saw him clearly,
surrounded by flames.

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:02.180
Because of Straw Hat Luffy,

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:06.051
Fishman Island,
our country will be...

00:23:08.286 --> 00:23:10.088
[SHARLEY]
...destroyed!

00:23:13.525 --> 00:23:15.293
[NARRATOR]
Beneath its dazzling exterior,

00:23:15.327 --> 00:23:17.896
Fishman Island hides
a dark history.

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:19.297
Harboring an age-old grudge,

00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:22.734
the residents of the island
prepare to take action.

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:25.404
Meanwhile, Luffy and friends
cause a commotion

00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:28.573
at Pappagu's shop, and have
an unexpected encounter

00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:31.877
with Neptune, King
of Fishman Island.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.645
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.678 --> 00:23:37.616
"The King of the Fishman Island!
Neptune, the God of the Sea!"

00:23:37.649 --> 00:23:40.085
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
