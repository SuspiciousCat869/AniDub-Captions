Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18

While laughing out loud

Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27

Gotta find my way, Sail away

28

All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32

Let's press forward

37
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,658
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,427
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,697
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,567
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,403
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42

sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,777
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,445
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,114
of the World Government,

47
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:05,185
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

Luffy set out to rescue
his captured brother, Ace.

54
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,545
To do so, he snuck into the
government prison Impel Down.

55
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,315
[NARRATOR]
Together with Captain Buggy,

56

as well as former Baroque Works
agents Mr. 3 and Bon Clay,

57
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,486
Luffy was able to make his way

58
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,323
to Level 4:
The Burning Heat Hell.

59
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,793
[NARRATOR]
But as soon as he arrived,

60
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,628
he was poisoned by Magellan,

61
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,798

[BON CLAY (HANNYABAL)]
No freaking way!

00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,651
I mean, uh... what do you mean
you can't make an antidote?

67
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,219
What's the hold up?

68
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,421
A miracle?

[grunts] Well, then,
we have no choice.

78
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,459
We should lock ourselves inside!

to bite your way
through, mister wolf.

This Candle House

Yeah, I heard ya.

176
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:06,355
Said you're looking
for Ivankov, right?

177
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,057
Yeah, do you
know something?

178
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,860
Look, over there.
You see that forest?

179
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:12,295
Yes.

180
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:13,996
[PRISONER H]
There's an abandoned jailhouse

181
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,399
way beyond the tree-line.

182
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:18,934
A while back,
I saw this strange guy

183
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:21,437
just dancing around out there.

184
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,438
Really?

185
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:25,374
Yeah, I think it was him.
It's worth a look.

186
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,878
[BON CLAY]
Thanks, friend.

187
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,646
[PRISONER H]
We're all in this together.

188
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,850
That forest, it's where
the wolves live.

189
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,452
[PRISONER H]
Oh, is it?

190
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:38,521
[PRISONER H laughing]

191
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:50,533
[GUARD H] Every so often,
people disappear in Impel Down.

192
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,468
We're sure they didn't
just break out,

193
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,837
as some of the missing
could barely move.

194
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,372
They just vanished
without a trace,

195
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,074
and no one seems
to know the cause.

196
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:00,976
We've come to call it,
"demoning away."

197
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,879
[GUARD H] All the guards here
have come to fear

198
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,582
these unnatural and
strange disappearances.

199
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:08,617
We believe that those missing
have been dragged

200
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:12,621
to the gates of hell,
hence why we call it what we do.

201
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:13,889
[BON CLAY]
"The gates of hell"?

202
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,124
"Demoning away"?

203
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:17,993
Quit pulling my tail!
No way Iva disappeared

204
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:20,629
because of some
superstitious mumbo jumbo.

205
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:21,797
I've never met him myself,

206
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:24,066
but his reputation
certainly precedes him.

207
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,701
Even in a hell like this place,

208
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:28,337
I'm sure he can still
make a miracle happen.

209
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:36,479
[BON CLAY] Because Iva
is our queen! Our god!

210
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:44,086
Somehow, I know
he can save Straw Boy.

211
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:49,091
[BON CLAY] If we can't count
on an antidote anymore--

[BON CLAY panting]

213
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:54,997
[BON CLAY]
He's his only chance.

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,103
Iva, I swear I'll find you!

215
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,705
No matter what!

you're doing to my friend, Bon?

[ARMY WOLVES whine]

236
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:24,787

Leave him...

Where did you go?

[sighs] This place
is like stupid hot.

It's so steamy!

Wait a minute. Priorities.

Where's that pansy prisoner
who beat up all the guards?

253
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:36,143
He's gotta be around
here somewhere.

254
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,113
[HANNYABAL]
Wait, who are you?

255
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,181
[BON CLAY (NAMI)] Who I am
doesn't really matter right now,

some assistance, here?

Uh?

Whew! Can't you see
how sweaty I am?

Oh, surely you can help me
out of these rags! Please?

This is the worst day ever.

I'll just blame it on
the warden, of course,

270

Oh, my tummy!

277
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:54,154
[SALDEATH] That's right.
We got the riot shut down.

278
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:56,623
All of the prisoners have been
returned to their cells,

279
00:16:56,657 --> 00:16:59,026
and we've retrieved
the keys, but--

00:17:00,594 --> 00:17:04,998
I think some are missing.
Damn it. What a pain.

somewhere on this floor!

Where did he go? Straw Boy!

293
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,371

people talking somewhere.

What the--?

310
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:54,675
I'll seat you. What floor
did you come from, by the way?

311
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:58,412
We've got plenty to eat here.
I'd guess you're hungry.

312
00:18:58,445 --> 00:19:02,249
Wait, where am I?
Where's Straw Boy?

313
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:05,819
[laughs] What, do you think you
somehow magically made it out

314
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,887
of the prison?

315
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,058
Don't worry. You're still
in Impel Down, sweetie.

316
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:12,893
No way! That's a lie!

317
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:14,862

any prison clothes!

Everyone's drinking
and having fun!

319
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:18,165
Did I wake up
in some kind of paradise?

320
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,733
What's the deal?

321
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:21,969
Hold on... I remember.

322
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:25,973
[BON CLAY] I was chased down
and attacked by those wolves.

323
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:27,908
Then, Straw Boy
woke up and helped me.

324
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:30,077
After that, I passed out.

325
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,411
[thud]

326
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:34,281
[BON CLAY]
Then, maybe I am dreaming!

327
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:40,120
Or wait! What if I died from
the cold and I'm in heaven now!

Close, but no cigar.

[BON CLAY]
Huh?

330
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:44,458
You've been sleeping
like a baby.

331
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:46,960
Out cold for ten hours now.

332
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:49,496
Ten hours? Are you kidding me?

333
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,464
And who are you?

334
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:53,267
[WOMAN]
My name is Inazuma.

335
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,769
Hm. Mind your manners!

336
00:19:55,802 --> 00:19:58,372
I'm the one who fetched you from
that bitter cold, after all.

337
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,841
You're lucky you two
didn't die from exposure.

338
00:20:00,874 --> 00:20:03,377
Wait, did you say "you two"?

339
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,445
So you brought
Straw Boy here, too?

340
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:07,180
Well then, where is he?

341
00:20:07,214 --> 00:20:10,918
Speak up! Answer me!
Damn you! There's no time!

342
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:13,120
[sighs] Patience now.

343
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:20,527
Let him explain things to you.

344
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:23,230
Him, who?

345
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,499
[PATRON F] Oh, the lights
are down! It's time!

346
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:27,100
[PATRON G]
The show's starting!

347
00:20:27,134 --> 00:20:28,802
You'll want a front row seat.

[CROWD cheering]

349
00:20:37,044 --> 00:20:40,013
What is this?

350
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:43,083
[PERFORMER] Did you sleep tight,
little candy boy?

351
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:48,922
[PERFORMER]
Or should I say little Bon Boy?

352
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,458
How do you know my name?

353
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:54,494
[CROWD cheering]

354
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:58,031
[PERFORMER]
Thank you for coming.

355
00:20:58,065 --> 00:20:59,766
Are you ready?

356
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:05,038
Shake it! Sexy!

357
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:07,007
[PERFORMER]
To get here,

358
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,044
you have to pass through
the sewers of Impel Down.

359
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:15,282
[PERFORMER] Following paths
that shouldn't exist

360
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,251
to a place beyond imagination.

361
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:22,155
It's a prisoner's paradise!

362
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:30,030
We've got every pleasure you
could ever beg for, right here!

363
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:32,299
Drinks!

364
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,401
Weapons!

365
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:36,470
Games!

366
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:40,207
But most of all,
we have freedom!

367
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,845
Yeah, you said it!
We got our freedom!

368
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:45,979
[PERFORMER]
Looks like the jailers

369
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,216
are flipping their tops again.

370
00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:51,151
"Prisoners have disappeared!"

371
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,320
"They've been
pulled down into hell!"

372
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,189
Those silly little fools
couldn't be more wrong!

373
00:21:56,223 --> 00:21:59,393
We're here and we're queer!

374
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:04,464
[CROWD cheering]

375
00:22:04,498 --> 00:22:07,567
[PERFORMER] I wouldn't exactly
call this hell, would you?

376
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:11,638
[PERFORMER]
Well, who knows? Maybe it is.

377
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:14,541
But, if so, at least
it's a gay one!

378
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:17,978
The secret underground
where dreams come true!

379
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:21,448
[PERFORMER]
I bid you welcome.

380
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:28,221
To Impel Down
Level 5.5, bitches!

381
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:32,025
A secret garden
for all y'all prisoners! Ahh!

382
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,062
This is New Kama Land!

383
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:37,230
[ALL]
Hee-haw!

[CROWD cheering]

385
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,603
They're... all queer like me.

386
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:45,639
[CROWD]
Yeah! Iva! We love you, Iva!

387
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:46,440
Wha?

388
00:22:46,473 --> 00:22:48,675
Iva!

389
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,877
Iva!

390
00:22:51,678 --> 00:22:53,313
That's Iva?

391
00:22:53,346 --> 00:22:57,117
The-The legendary
Miracle Worker?

392
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,486
The Queen of
Kamabakka Kingdom?

393
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:00,353
[QUEEN singing]

394
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:02,522
[CROWD]
Hee-haw!

395
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:05,625
[BON CLAY]
Emporio Ivankov?

396
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:07,561
[IVANKOV]
Hee-haw!

397
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:16,937
[NARRATOR] Rescued by Inazuma,
Bon Clay is relieved to hear

398
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,672
that Iva will cure
Luffy's poison.

399
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,674
However, when he
discovers the toll

400
00:23:20,707 --> 00:23:22,476
that it will take
on his friend's body,

401
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:25,178
his joy quickly turns to dread.

402
00:23:25,212 --> 00:23:28,181
Now, the battle
for Luffy's life truly begins.

403
00:23:28,215 --> 00:23:29,716
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

404
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,620
"Luffy's Treatment Begins.
Iva's Miraculous Power!"

405
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:36,256
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
