00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:30.247
[cackles]

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.557
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.292
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:38.496
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.239
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:37.949
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.983 --> 00:02:40.822
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:46.132
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.771
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.804 --> 00:02:51.944
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:53.881
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.286
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.324
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:03.768
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:05.403
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:09.044
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:13.386
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:17.995
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:21.469
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.504 --> 00:03:24.175
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:27.114
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:27.148 --> 00:03:29.018
When Luffy hears about
a fighting tournament

00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:30.454
at the Corrida Colosseum

00:03:30.487 --> 00:03:32.792
with the Flame Flame
Fruit as the prize,

00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:34.796
he decides to join
and compete against

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.802
titanic contenders from
all over the New World.

00:03:37.835 --> 00:03:41.242
Meanwhile, in the Tontatta
Kingdom on Green Bit,

00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:42.913
where the Little
People reside...

00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:45.383
It's time to take
flight, everybody!

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:48.422
With Usoland, beside us,
there's no way we can lose!

00:03:48.456 --> 00:03:52.498
We'll bring our friends back
and Princess Mancherie, too!

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:55.671
Doflamingo has caused
a great deal of suffering,

00:03:55.705 --> 00:03:58.511
especially for
the Tontatta tribe.

00:03:58.544 --> 00:04:00.581
But our troubled
relationship with his group

00:04:00.614 --> 00:04:04.021
actually began long before
he took over the throne.

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.260
[GANCHO]
In fact,

00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:11.168
the beginning of this sad tale
stretches back over 900 years.

00:04:11.202 --> 00:04:14.308
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, at the
King Riku Army Headquarters,

00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:16.647
an opposition
to Doflamingo gathers.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.118
[ZORO]
Damn, Luffy, get it together!

00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:22.424
That sneaky little bastard.
There's a fighting competition

00:04:22.457 --> 00:04:24.429
and he doesn't
bother telling me?

00:04:24.462 --> 00:04:26.867
I could've cleaned up!

00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:29.739
Might as well go ahead
and give me Caesar's heart.

00:04:29.772 --> 00:04:32.477
[LAW panting]

00:04:32.512 --> 00:04:34.550
[DOFLAMINGO] Haven't you
done enough scurrying around

00:04:34.583 --> 00:04:37.287
like a miserable rat?

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:42.497
[cackles] I set a trap
for your little partner,

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:43.567
and wouldn't you know it,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.773
that genius has
walked right into it.

00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:48.944
Straw Hat doesn't
stand a chance.

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:52.919
I'm sure they're scraping
him off the wall as we speak.

00:04:52.952 --> 00:04:55.959
Your alliance has fallen apart.

00:04:55.992 --> 00:04:57.662
So...

00:04:57.695 --> 00:05:00.266
...are you ready to give up?

00:05:11.155 --> 00:05:14.161
[CROWD cheering]

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.204

00:05:35.538 --> 00:05:36.807
[LUFFY]
Let's finish this!

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.677
As you wish, boy!

00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:41.182

[CROWD gasps]

00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:45.925
All right, how 'bout this?!

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:48.363
Gum-Gum Jet Gatling!

[WOMAN A]
Kick his ass, Chin Jao!

00:06:46.747 --> 00:06:49.719
Two unstoppable forces
in a deadly struggle!

00:06:49.752 --> 00:06:52.357
They're matching blow for blow!

00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:06.687
Sorry, folks.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.289
Their attacks are
happening so fast,

00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:11.462
I can't even keep up,
no matter how hard I try!

00:07:15.403 --> 00:07:18.409
[GYATS] But I can feel their
incredible force of will!

00:07:18.443 --> 00:07:22.183
It's clear we are witnessing
history in the making!

00:07:26.526 --> 00:07:28.162
[GYATS]
This is, without a doubt,

00:07:28.196 --> 00:07:32.437
one of the greatest battles ever
fought in the Corrida Coliseum!

00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:35.377
[panting]

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.453
[chuckles] Not bad for a twerp.

00:07:40.487 --> 00:07:46.866
[panting] I admit, for
a geezer, you're tough.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.006
[groans] What did you say?

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.610
Huh?

00:07:51.643 --> 00:07:54.883
Repeat what you just said to me!

00:07:54.916 --> 00:07:57.956
You think I'm "tough," do you?

00:07:57.989 --> 00:08:00.695
How dare you insult me?!

00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:03.734
You're nuts! I'm saying you're
strong. What's wrong with that?

00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:07.208
As far as I'm concerned,
that's an insult!

00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:09.178
Just look at me! Strong?

00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:11.816
I'm like a wolf without fangs!

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.025
No! Just an old round-headed
man without his drill!

00:08:16.058 --> 00:08:17.361
[CROWD gasps]

00:08:17.394 --> 00:08:18.965
But how could a brat like you

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.637
ever comprehend the
misery I experience?

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.910
A mere shadow of my
former glorious self!

00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:28.116
I feel frustrated!
Full of disappointment!

00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:29.986
Overwhelmed with sorrow!

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.594
You'll never understand
what I've had to endure!

00:08:33.628 --> 00:08:34.929
Yeah, you're right!

00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:37.802
How am I supposed to understand
when you don't explain anything?

00:08:37.835 --> 00:08:40.407
You just keep attacking me
and breaking into tears!

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.878
So you truly wish to
know the reason why?

00:08:42.912 --> 00:08:46.987
The tragic story of how
I came to look this way?

00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:49.024
[LUFFY] Well, when you
put it like that, no.

00:08:49.057 --> 00:08:53.433
Well, if you insist boy,
I shall tell you before you die.

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:56.238
It begins 30 years ago.

00:09:14.543 --> 00:09:17.380
Dammit! What the hell's
going on with this ice?

00:09:17.414 --> 00:09:22.358
It doesn't melt! Axes won't
break it! So what do we do?

00:09:22.391 --> 00:09:24.361
[grunts]

00:09:24.394 --> 00:09:26.365
[MAN B] Of course there's
an unbelievable amount

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.839
of pirate treasure under it
just out of our reach!

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.523
[CHIN JAO chuckles] You could
try for a hundred years,

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:41.228
you wouldn't make a scratch
in the ice with those tools!

00:09:41.261 --> 00:09:42.298
[MEN]
Huh?

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:43.767
This whole continent--

00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:46.305
It's made of a
"Crystal Ice Sheet."

00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:47.407
Meaning...

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.644
...if you want to shatter it,

00:09:48.677 --> 00:09:52.317
then you must apply tremendous
pressure in one spot!

[CHIN JAO cackles]

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:52.304

these wannabe treasure thieves

The entirety of my life's work

is held safely within

Hope for the future.
Joy and sorrow of the past.

All told in centuries'
worth of my family's treasures!

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.750
And the only key to
the room is my drill head.

00:11:14.783 --> 00:11:17.353
Without it there's
no way to get inside.

00:11:22.698 --> 00:11:25.337

Nobody can invade my sanctuary!

Not even the Navy!

Today's the day! I've been
doing some training

than my head drill!

Get ready to eat
those words, Chin Jao!

00:14:32.277 --> 00:14:34.381
Right in front of me...
just out of reach!

00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:37.755
Everything I've worked
for is sealed away!

00:14:37.789 --> 00:14:40.994
An endless fortune!

00:14:43.232 --> 00:14:45.771
[CHIN JAO groans]

00:14:45.804 --> 00:14:49.912
[CHIN JAO] Damn you, Garp!
You will pay for this!

00:14:49.945 --> 00:14:53.787
Curse your children
and grandchildren, too!

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.058
Curse you...

00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:59.632
...for all eternity, bastard!

00:15:02.303 --> 00:15:04.542
A short time after
that, I retired.

00:15:04.575 --> 00:15:06.111
Gave up pirating.

00:15:06.145 --> 00:15:09.518
My power was gone and
my heart broken into pieces.

00:15:09.552 --> 00:15:12.925
The man I once was disappeared
and only a shell remained.

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:16.599
I spent my days
just waiting to die.

00:15:16.633 --> 00:15:17.801
Till now,

00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:19.906
when Garp's grandson
is delivered to me

00:15:19.939 --> 00:15:22.845
like an oasis in my
desert of suffering.

00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:27.754
[CHIN JAO]
This must be destiny!

00:15:27.788 --> 00:15:30.293
You're gonna pay for what
you're grandfather did to me!

00:15:30.326 --> 00:15:32.030
And after I get
finished with you,

00:15:32.063 --> 00:15:35.704
he'll experience a life as
miserable as mine has been!

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.746
[CHIN JAO]
This must be destiny!

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.251
You're gonna pay for what
you're grandfather did to me!

00:15:59.284 --> 00:16:01.054
And after I get
finished with you,

00:16:01.087 --> 00:16:04.327
he'll experience a life as
miserable as mine has been!

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.064
That was a great story and all,

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:08.002
but there's just
one problem with it.

00:16:08.036 --> 00:16:09.271
I'm not my grandpa!

00:16:09.305 --> 00:16:10.507
Didn't you hear me?!

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.843
I curse you all!

00:16:11.876 --> 00:16:14.414
Well, I'm not gonna
get beaten by you here!

00:16:14.448 --> 00:16:16.686
I'm still gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:16:16.719 --> 00:16:19.391
All I gotta do is
win Ace's fruit!

00:16:19.424 --> 00:16:22.396
So I'm not done yet! Got it?

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.470
[chuckles] Now, that's
a good joke!

00:16:25.504 --> 00:16:27.340
There's no chance! Give up!

00:16:27.373 --> 00:16:29.310
[gasps]

00:16:29.344 --> 00:16:31.950
You're nothing but
children drunk on infamy!

00:16:31.983 --> 00:16:34.254
They call you the
Worst Generation!

00:16:34.287 --> 00:16:35.456
But you're not strong enough

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:39.565
to sail across the ocean
your forbearers fought upon.

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:42.804
After Whitebeard's death,
it was the end of an era!

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.145
[CHIN JAO] In fact, the only
pirate from your generation

00:16:46.178 --> 00:16:49.519
with even a sliver of
potential is Blackbeard Teach.

00:16:49.552 --> 00:16:50.621
Blackbeard?

00:16:50.654 --> 00:16:53.392
[CHIN JAO]
Well, perhaps time will tell.

00:16:53.425 --> 00:16:54.962
But face i!

00:16:54.995 --> 00:16:56.498
If you're only able to match me

00:16:56.533 --> 00:16:59.170
in terms of strength in
my current lowly state,

00:16:59.204 --> 00:17:00.841
you don't stand a chance!

00:17:00.874 --> 00:17:04.314
Just throw in the towel already!

00:17:04.347 --> 00:17:05.951
[LUFFY grunts]

00:17:06.686 --> 00:17:09.959
[CHIN JAO]
Head-Arms! Spin!

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.236
[CHIN JAO]
Wild Dance!

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:33.005
[LUFFY grunts]

00:17:37.748 --> 00:17:39.351
[CHIN JAO]
Hmm?

00:17:39.384 --> 00:17:40.787
[LUFFY grunts]

00:17:42.457 --> 00:17:46.298
[CHIN JAO groaning]

00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:49.939
[LUFFY grunts]

00:17:51.676 --> 00:17:55.116
Now for my Gum-Gum Hawk Rifle!

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.555
Whoa! Here it comes!

00:17:57.588 --> 00:17:59.424
[yells]

00:17:59.457 --> 00:18:02.598
[groans]

00:18:02.632 --> 00:18:06.004
[yelling]

00:18:06.038 --> 00:18:09.344
[CHIN JAO groaning]

00:18:16.926 --> 00:18:19.898
[CROWD gasps]

00:18:24.407 --> 00:18:27.047
[CHIN JAO]
Hm? Mm...

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.652
That's all you've got?

00:18:29.685 --> 00:18:33.359
Ah. Like I already said,
you're not a shabby opponent.

00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:35.430
But if Rayleigh
chose a brat like you

00:18:35.463 --> 00:18:37.835
as a flag bearer
for the New Generation,

00:18:37.868 --> 00:18:40.306
he's not as sharp
as he used to be.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.045
The Navy on the other
hand, they were wise.

00:18:43.078 --> 00:18:46.719
Fire Fist, he had the Devil's
blood flowing in his veins.

00:18:46.752 --> 00:18:50.326
They stamped him just in time.

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:53.567
You think you can beat the Navy
Admirals and Four Emperors?

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.338
And somehow surpass
Roger's legacy as well?!

00:18:56.372 --> 00:18:57.642
Don't make me laugh!

00:18:57.675 --> 00:18:58.710
No one can!

00:18:58.743 --> 00:19:01.214
It's impossible!

00:19:01.248 --> 00:19:03.452
Then just watch me!

00:19:03.485 --> 00:19:05.489
Gum-Gum Rocket!

00:19:05.524 --> 00:19:08.429
Wait! Is he flying?

00:19:08.462 --> 00:19:11.368
What an incredibly high leap!

00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:13.974
[CHIN JAO]
All right, boy!

00:19:14.007 --> 00:19:16.211
Time for your final lesson!

00:19:16.244 --> 00:19:19.217
I've been holding onto 30
years of rage towards Garp.

00:19:19.251 --> 00:19:21.422
Now it's time to
collect, Straw Hat,

00:19:21.455 --> 00:19:24.629
in the form of an
all-out KO skull smash!

00:19:24.662 --> 00:19:26.464
What the--? Look!

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:29.539
Wait, am I hallucinating?

00:19:29.572 --> 00:19:32.410
Lucy's arm is inflating
like a balloon!

00:19:32.444 --> 00:19:34.047
[CHIN JAO]
Witness me, Garp!

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.053
I'm about to take your
precious grandson's life!

00:19:37.086 --> 00:19:39.090
You hear me?!

00:19:39.124 --> 00:19:41.461
Straw Hat! It's time
for you to pay for

00:19:41.494 --> 00:19:44.268
your old man's right hook that
took everything away from me

00:19:44.301 --> 00:19:45.871
and destroyed my life!

00:19:45.904 --> 00:19:48.744
A punch?! That's why
you're so bent outta shape?!

00:19:48.777 --> 00:19:50.046
Come on!

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:52.918
I can't even remember how many
times I got slugged by him!

00:19:52.951 --> 00:19:54.120
[CHIN JAO]
Then I'll finish the job

00:19:54.154 --> 00:19:56.726
and pulverize every
bone in your body!

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.197
Hasshoken Technique!

00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:04.074
[LUFFY]
Get ready for my Gum-Gum...

00:20:04.107 --> 00:20:06.512
...Thor!

00:20:06.546 --> 00:20:09.284
[CHIN JAO]
Non-Drill Dragon!

00:20:09.317 --> 00:20:12.090
Elephant Gun!

00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:14.026
[CHIN JAO]
Non-Nail!

00:20:19.304 --> 00:20:24.080
[CHIN JAO yelling]

00:20:24.113 --> 00:20:28.221
[LUFFY yelling]

00:20:28.255 --> 00:20:33.265
[CHIN JAO, LUFFY yelling]

00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:46.725
[ALL]
Wha--?

00:20:46.759 --> 00:20:50.065
[GROUP]
Wha--?

00:20:52.705 --> 00:20:56.846
[BOTH]
Wha--?

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.685
[CROWD]
What?!

00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:26.973
Gramps!

00:21:27.006 --> 00:21:28.943
Are you dead?

00:21:31.214 --> 00:21:32.884
Wait! He's out!

00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:36.959
Chin Jao is eliminated.
This round's winner is Lucy!

00:21:36.992 --> 00:21:42.002
[CROWD cheering]

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:49.183
[GYATS]
This is simply remarkable!

00:21:49.217 --> 00:21:51.488
He bested a living legend!

00:21:51.522 --> 00:21:56.098
After a hard-fought battle,
we have a champion for Block C.

00:21:56.131 --> 00:21:59.337
Let's hear it for Lucy!

00:21:59.371 --> 00:22:01.108
Heck yeah!

00:22:01.141 --> 00:22:06.150
[CROWD]
Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy...

00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:14.100
[laughs]

00:22:14.134 --> 00:22:17.440
[GYATS] I admit, I never
expected him to go this far!

00:22:17.473 --> 00:22:21.115
Who could have predicted a
surprise ending like this?

00:22:21.148 --> 00:22:23.720
Listen to all those
idiots cheer him on!

00:22:23.753 --> 00:22:25.757
I'm sick of this "Lucy" crap!

00:22:25.791 --> 00:22:28.428
Even under a false name,
he gets the limelight!

00:22:28.461 --> 00:22:30.767
But, now that the match is done,

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.706
you're mine! And
this time, you're dead!

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.977
[BARTOLOMEO]
Are you deaf, Cavendish?

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.482
I'm not gonna let you touch him.

00:22:38.516 --> 00:22:40.086
No freakin' way.

00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:43.660
You get in my way, and I'll
kill you as well, Bartolomeo!

00:22:43.693 --> 00:22:46.364
[BARTOLOMEO cackles]
I'd like to see you try.

00:22:46.397 --> 00:22:48.603
[CAVENDISH]
I'm the one to kill Straw Hat!

00:22:48.636 --> 00:22:50.139
[BURGESS]
Straw Hat?

00:22:50.172 --> 00:22:51.408
[GYATS]
He toppled a legend,

00:22:51.441 --> 00:22:53.746
but can he hold on
to this momentum?

00:22:53.779 --> 00:22:55.182
And if not Lucy,

00:22:55.216 --> 00:22:57.755
who will go on to
win the championship

00:22:57.788 --> 00:22:59.926
and take home the
Flame Flame Fruit?

00:22:59.959 --> 00:23:05.369
[BURGESS grunts, laughs]

00:23:05.403 --> 00:23:07.273
I get it!

00:23:07.306 --> 00:23:09.578
This should be interesting!

00:23:14.755 --> 00:23:16.525
[NARRATOR]
After winning the Block C title,

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:19.865
Luffy is reunited with the
mysterious gladiator, Rebecca.

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:20.868
When the two of them

00:23:20.901 --> 00:23:22.871
enter the darkness
of Dressrosa together,

00:23:22.905 --> 00:23:25.409
Luffy learns the secret
of her tragic plight,

00:23:25.442 --> 00:23:26.912
as the determined young warrior

00:23:26.946 --> 00:23:30.185
shares the tale of the
cruel fate she bears.

00:23:30.219 --> 00:23:31.990
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.023 --> 00:23:35.095
"Luffy and the Gladiator
of Fate, Rebecca!"

00:23:35.128 --> 00:23:38.034
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
