00:11:15.107 --> 00:11:17.910
[BROOK] I hate to
question you, Kin'emon,

00:11:17.943 --> 00:11:20.046
but where exactly are you going?

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:21.047
I will hurry!

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.982
But I'm certain I hear
the voices of children

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:24.817
not far from here!

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.720
What? You can't
leave me here to die!

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:29.188
Well, I'm already dead,

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:32.324
but that poison gas
will be here eventually!

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:34.493
I've come to save you,
Momonosuke!

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.028
Ah! Children!

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:37.163
Huh?

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:38.464
--[CHILDREN gasp]
--[KIN'EMON] Pardon me.

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:40.533
[KIN'EMON]
Do you know Momonosuke?

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:42.935
You must assist me.
I am his father!

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:43.669
[CHILDREN whimper]

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:44.737
[BOY B]
Scary!

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.038
What?

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:48.307
No! Why do you flee?

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.475
Uh...

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:51.410
[CHILDREN gasp]

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:54.213
Look at them all! Where is he?

00:11:54.246 --> 00:11:57.316
Surely he must be near!
Please tell me, children!

00:11:57.349 --> 00:11:58.484
Where is my boy?

00:11:58.517 --> 00:12:00.519
[CHILDREN shriek]

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:01.921
[KIN'EMON]
Huh?

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:05.691
Who knew there
were this many here?

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.793
[CHILDREN cry, gasp]

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:10.496
[BROOK]
You're in danger! Hurry!

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:12.765
We'll take you
kids to Building R!

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:14.233
[CHILDREN scream]

00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:17.436
That's not nice! Well, anyway,
I'm glad they're all safe.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.638
Let's be off, then, shall we?

00:12:19.672 --> 00:12:22.808
Um, did you say that you
were looking for Momonosuke?

00:12:22.842 --> 00:12:24.510
[gasps]

00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:27.480
[KONBU] You can't take the
candy for yourself, Mocha!

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:30.783
[DOLAN] Yeah! You better
share it with us!

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:34.220
[MOCHA] You guys!
No! I can't! I'm sorry.

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.322
It's bad for you!

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:39.525
Mocha, hold on!

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:42.394
[CHOPPER] Robin!
Keep them still for a second!

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:46.766
Right! Cien Fleurs!

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:50.035
[CHILDREN yelp, groan]

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:52.104
Oh, no! They've got me!

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:54.640
II'm sorry, but I had to.

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:58.811
Here you go, guys. This should
ease the pain a little bit.

00:12:58.844 --> 00:13:01.480
[GIRL B grunts]

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:11.624
Hurry!

00:13:11.657 --> 00:13:14.026
You can't let them get
their hands on the candy!

Don't stop, okay?

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.635
Yeah, okay, Nami!

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:24.970
Don't worry, Chopper!
I'm never giving up!

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:27.606
This candy isn't
gonna hurt us anymore!

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.742
I'm gonna make sure!

00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:53.566

Hey. You all right?

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:19.024
Okay. I'll handle
it from here. Watch!

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.760
[LUFFY grunts]

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:25.030
Look out, Caesar,
'cause here I come!

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:43.282
Once I end you, I'll go
find your troops and say,

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:45.150
"Your poor captain
just couldn't cut it."

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:46.485

[MARINE J] It's my
shoulder! She bit it off!

[TASHIGI] If I let go,
I'll lose my shoulder!

[TASHIGI screams]

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:55.187
[MONET]
I gave you a chance,

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.890
but if you'd rather I tear you
apart.

00:15:57.923 --> 00:16:02.928

[MONET groans]

00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:24.483
[ZORO] If you hadn't
been runnin' your mouth,

00:16:24.516 --> 00:16:26.652
you'd be done with her by now.

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:29.221
But your time's up.

00:16:29.254 --> 00:16:30.789
[grunts]

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:37.563

this quick, all right?

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:43.902
[grunts]

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:50.142
[MONET] I could've sworn
he wouldn't cut a woman,

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.277
but it looks like I was wrong.

00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:55.514
He swung at me without
a moments' hesitation!

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:58.684
So you've misjudged me.

00:16:58.717 --> 00:16:59.818
How 'bout that?

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:06.525
If you thought you couldn't
beat me, you shoulda run.

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:08.527
That was a fatal mistake.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.429
[grunts]

00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:15.000
[ZORO] Maybe I don't go around
cutting just anyone, but still.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:16.602
Think.

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.471
When you're face-to-face

00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:21.974
with an animal that
can rip you to shreds,

00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:24.043
you don't take
any chances, do you?

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:25.878
You get the hell outta there.

What's happening to me?

[TASHIGI panting]

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:41.787

He cut her.

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:55.934
[MONET groans]

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.604
Did she not die?

00:19:02.274 --> 00:19:03.675
That's odd.

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:05.544
He didn't use his Haki!

00:19:05.577 --> 00:19:08.347
[MONET groans]
I see.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.584
So you showed me mercy.

00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:21.093
[MONET groans]

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:32.538
[TASHIGI]
She lost control of her body.

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.640
She must have been
petrified when she realized

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:37.409
that she'd die if
Zoro used his Haki.

00:19:39.878 --> 00:19:43.182
[TASHIGI] I've never
seen anything like that.

00:19:43.215 --> 00:19:45.450
I wonder what the
Straw Hat Pirates were doing

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:47.886
during those two
years they went missing.

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:51.757
[TASHIGI]
How much stronger are they now?

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.692
It's amazing.

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:58.597
Roro... noa Zoro!

00:20:04.102 --> 00:20:07.005

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:17.182
Sorry, but...

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.817
...you're finished.

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:36.168
What was all that about?!

00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:37.803
After everything you said,

00:20:37.836 --> 00:20:39.838
you still didn't try
to kill that girl!

00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:43.375
See? I was right about you,
and you can't deny it!

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:46.778
I don't recall asking you to
finish my fight for me, Captain.

00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:48.947
If you hadn't
killed her, I would've.

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:50.582
You just stepped in.

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:53.185
Hey! That's not fair!
You can't say that.

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:55.320
I stepped in because
you were leaving!

00:20:55.354 --> 00:20:57.222
[ZORO]
Nobody forced you.

00:20:58.323 --> 00:20:59.291
[ZORO]
But, hey.

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:01.159
[TASHIGI]
Hm?

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:03.228
Good job, Miss Four Eyes.

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:07.266
She's dead, so she can't
hurt anyone else anymore.

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:09.568
I don't mind if
you take the credit.

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:12.070
[TASHIGI gasps]
Could you be more patronizing?!

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.539
You think you're better than me?

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:15.774
[ZORO]
Pretty much.

[ZORO]
Hm?

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.186
What's with you?

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.356
[panting] I'll be all right.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.893
Just go on without me.

00:21:34.926 --> 00:21:37.829

Aw, poor, useless, little Monet.

coming to Building R after all!

Well, I can always
use more test subjects.

Please, hurry all you like.

00:21:51.209 --> 00:21:54.613

[NARRATOR] Mocha takes off
running as fast as she can,

00:22:20.038 --> 00:22:23.141
desperately clinging to the
deadly candy with every step.

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:25.544
But the rampaging children
quickly surround her

00:22:25.577 --> 00:22:27.512
and attempt to take
it for themselves.

00:22:27.546 --> 00:22:28.647
In a moment of panic,

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.983
Mocha's next move causes
Chopper to cry out with grief.

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.985

On the next One Piece!
