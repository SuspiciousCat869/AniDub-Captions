1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,575
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,177
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:44,480
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:47,417
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,251
Monkey D. Luffy,

42
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:50,186
a boy whose
body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,788
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:54,724
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,594
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

46
00:02:57,627 --> 00:02:59,262
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:00,763
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:04,100
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:07,704
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:11,107
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,177
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,715
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

53
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:24,821
[NARRATOR] Luffy was sent flying
from the Sabaody Archipelago

54
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:27,123
by Bartholomew Kuma.

55
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:28,825
After soaring through
the sky for hours,

56
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:32,328
he found himself in a kingdom
inhabited entirely by women,

57
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:34,297
Amazon Lily.

58
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,698
After a difficult battle,

59
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:37,800
he won the favor
of their empress,

60
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,903
a woman named Boa Hancock.

61
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:41,771
She agreed to take
him back to Sabaody

62
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,275
on a pirate ship scheduled
to leave the next day.

63
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,779
Granny Nyon! It's terrible!

64
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,649
[NYON] Enishida?
What's all the fuss about?

65
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,419
It's awful.

66
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,621
She's come down with a sickness.

67
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,857
And no one knows what it is!

68
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:08,564
[MOMONGA] You're a
damned fool, Boa Hancock.

69
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:11,434
Empress or not,

70
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,503
one does not simply
ignore a summons

71
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,605
from the World Government.

72
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:16,806
[MOMONGA]
The weight of your pride

73
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,542
is going to sink
your entire nation.

74
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:22,245
If we don't recognize
you as a Warlord of the Sea,

75
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:25,281
your position as their
ruler is meaningless.

76
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:28,251
[LUFFY] Love is a Hurricane!

77
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:30,186
Love-Love Hancock.

78
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:36,526
[SANDERSONIA]
Whatever it is, fight it!

79
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,794
Don't give up!

80
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,267
[NYON] What's this about
the Snake Princess falling ill?

81
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,269
Oh... Granny Nyon!

82
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:52,809
[NYON] Man. I need
you to wait outside.

83
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:55,345
What? But why? I'm in a hurry.

84
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,546
I nyo that!

85
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:03,920
It hurts.

86
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,423
[BELLADONNA]
She keeps clutching her chest.

87
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:09,892
Perhaps something
is wrong with her heart.

88
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:17,600
I've never seen
anything like it.

89
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:18,968
Since her symptoms
are a mystery,

90
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:22,372
there's very little I can do
in terms of treatment.

91
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,874
[ENISHIDA] All we know is
that it's extremely painful.

92
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,777
She won't eat a thing and
she's hardly speaking, either.

93
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,387
I'll be out of here
tomorrow morning!

94
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,922
And soon, we're all
gonna be back together!

95
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:43,826
"Tomorrow morning."

96
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,762
[NYON] It's as I feared!

97
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:47,530
--Mon--
--[HANCOCK gasping]

98
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:48,765
--[NYON] Lu--
--[HANCOCK gasping]

99
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:49,866
What're you doing?

100
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,468
Whatever it is, Granny Nyon,
you've got to stop it!

101
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:54,504
Can't you see you're hurting
her with this nonsense?

102
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:57,006
Do you want to get to
the bottom of this or nyot?

103
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,977
[NYON] Yes. Of course.

104
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,914
That fool.
I should have realized.

105
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,850
It's a pity that the virus
came at a time like this.

106
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,385
Huh? Virus?

107
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,587
If you know what it is,
then just tell us!

108
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,390
I... I can't breathe,
Granny Nyon.

109
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:19,529
Am I going to die like this?

110
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:21,597
Indeed. Yes.

111
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,765
Oh, say it isn't so!

112
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,069
If this is supposed to be a
joke, we're not laughing!

113
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:28,571
It has killed us before.

114
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:31,307
It took the life
of our last empress.

115
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:36,612
[NYON] The same fate befell
the empress before her, too.

116
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,481
I suffered from
the illness myself,

117
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:41,017
but left the country
before it took my life.

118
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,419
No remedy could save me.

119
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:44,454
Snake Princess,

120
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,557
Monkey D. Luffy has
come to see you, as well.

121
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,958
This is hardly the time!

122
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,060
[NYON] He has a
request to ask of you.

123
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:52,762
Will you hear it?

124
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:55,631
What do you mean, request?
Can't you see she's suffering?

125
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,567
How important could it be?!

126
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:00,103
[ENISHIDA] What just happened?

127
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:03,039
[HANCOCK] Show him in. Quickly.

128
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:14,717
[NYON] Monkey D. Luffy,
you are a man favored by fate.

129
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,653
Perhaps this mountain
can be moved, after all.

130
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,790
And perhaps you
are the one to do it.

131
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,559
[HANCOCK]
I hear you need something?

132
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:27,130
Yeah, I sure do!

133
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:29,465
But are you okay?
I heard you were sick.

134
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:30,666
[HANCOCK] Never mind that.

135
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,768
No illness can overtake me.

136
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:38,741
[LUFFY] There's a pirate on
Whitebeard's crew named Ace.

137
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:41,410
He's my brother and
he's about to be executed.

138
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:43,513
I gotta go rescue him!

139
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,450
But I heard if we took a
pirate ship, it'd be too slow.

140
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:48,985
That man is your brother?

141
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:50,953
Do you mean Fire Fist Ace?

142
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:51,888
Exactly!

143
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:53,890
So instead of
going back to my friends,

144
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:57,627
I need you to get on a Navy ship
and take me with you!

145
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,529
How dare you even suggest that!

146
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,063
You selfish beast!

147
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:04,100
You know full well the horrors
our poor sister went through.

148
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:08,171
And still you would drag her
to that abhorrent prison?

149
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:09,805
How could you be so cruel?

150
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,874
This is exactly
why we hate men!

151
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,442
We very well
could have killed you,

152
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:14,810
but as soon as
we show you mercy,

153
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:16,512
then you let it go to your head!

154
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,781
You're lucky she doesn't turn
you to stone and smash you!

155
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:21,684
[HANCOCK] You want me to
follow the government's orders

156
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:23,819
and go with the other Warlords?

157
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:25,988
He's said enough!

158
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:28,724
Strike him down.

159
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,527
[HANCOCK]
If that is truly your request...

160
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,129
Then, of course!

161
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:36,432
I will go anywhere you like!

162
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:38,868
[gasping in shock]

163
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:40,970
Whoa, thanks!
I was worried!

164
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,805
I dunno what I would've
done without your help!

165
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:45,174
She... actually said yes.

166
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,077
She wouldn't listen to reason,
but she'll listen to him!

167
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,645
What happened to her, Granny?

168
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,781
Like the
empress before her...

169
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:52,982
Our Empress...

170
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:55,051
...succumbed to
the burning flames...

171
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:57,687
...that are known only as love!

172
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:01,190
There's a saying
in the East Blue

173
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:03,726
that describes
these winds of passion.

174
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:10,733
"Love is always a hurricane!"

175
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,105
[LUFFY chuckling]

176
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,546
[HANCOCK]
Heavens, my heart is aflutter!

177
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:27,049
I feel I might do
anything Luffy asks of me!

178
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,919
[HANCOCK] I acquiesced
without a second thought!

179
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:32,521
And I don't regret it,
not even the slightest!

180
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:34,056
That's what they call "love."

181
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,890
[gasps]

182
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:35,825
Love?

183
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:37,693
[NYON] Once it has
a hold on your heart,

184
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:40,096
it will squeeze and squeeze
until you fall over dead

185
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:43,099
if you cannyot be
with the one you desire.

186
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:45,134
The empresses
that came before you

187
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,236
all fell in love
with men as well,

188
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,739
but as they were unable
to leave their kingdom,

189
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:52,041
they were forced to
bottle up their feelings.

190
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:55,077
While they stayed,
their heartache grew and grew

191
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:58,781
until the pain was so great
that they died from sorrow.

192
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,686
Little did you nyo that
by agreeing to his request,

193
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:06,255
you may have
saved your own life.

194
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:08,190
Although you were
struck with lovesickness

195
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:11,894
if Luffy had nyot arrived
and requested this very thing,

196
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:14,030
you would have lost
your title as Warlord

197
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:16,666
and led this kingdom to ruin.

198
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:21,103
However, one may say that
he is just as fortunate as you.

199
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:22,038
After all,

200
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:24,173
had fate not
brought him to this island,

201
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,575
the only way he could
hope to enter that prison

202
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:29,712
would be in chains,
just like his brother.

203
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,827
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

204
00:10:36,861 --> 00:10:38,729
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL] Click.

205
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,231
[HANCOCK] Hello, Momonga.

206
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,067
Is this... Boa Hancock?

207
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,635
[HANCOCK]
Yes, and I have decided to honor

208
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:47,872
that little
request of yours, after all.

209
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:51,075
However, there is one condition
that must be met first.

210
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,009
Yes?

211
00:10:52,043 --> 00:10:53,110
[HANCOCK]
Naturally, if you can't accept,

212
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:56,013
you might as well turn
your boat around and leave.

213
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,917
[MOMONGA] All right,
enough suspense, then.

214
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,285
Let me hear it.

215
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:13,864
[AMAZONS saying their goodbyes]

216
00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:15,099
I thought he wasn't
leaving the kingdom

217
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,167
until tomorrow, though.

218
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,936
I heard there was a
last minute change of plans.

219
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,673
Now he's getting on a Navy ship
along with the Snake Princess!

220
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:23,407
[APHELANDRA] Hi, Luffy.

221
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:24,275
[LUFFY] Hey guys!

222
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,110
Thanks for everything!
This was fun!

223
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,713
I'll come back to visit
and bring my friends next time!

224
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:29,447
Your pirate crew?

225
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,915
Yeah,
I bet our chef would be

226
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:32,683
totally crazy about this place.

227
00:11:32,717 --> 00:11:34,685
He likes girls
so much it's scary!

228
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:36,987
Oh, but his food
is awesome. I promise!

229
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,957
I bet he'd love to cook for you!

230
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,292
Our musician's awesome, too.

231
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,426
He's a skeleton.

232
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,694
A skeleton?

233
00:11:43,728 --> 00:11:45,129
His name's Brook,
but watch out,

234
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,263
'cause as soon as he meets you,

235
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:48,032
he's gonna wanna
check out your panties.

236
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:49,133
Our panties?

237
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,936
I have lots to show him,
but I don't see the appeal.

238
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:53,904
And we've got this
little reindeer doctor

239
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:55,706
named Chopper, too.

240
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:01,812
Ahhh, but they're all guys,
'cept Nami and Robin,

241
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,015
but it's no fun
if we can't all visit.

242
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:06,417
Even if men
are forbidden here,

243
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,152
I think they'll
make an exception.

244
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,854
The Snake Princess
seems to favor you,

245
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:12,356
so it's not likely that they
would be sentenced to death.

246
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,425
[APHELANDRA]
Well, probably not, at least.

247
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,729
And there's our empress now!

248
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:21,098
[HANCOCK] Who had the audacity

249
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:23,768
to place these
beasts in my path?

250
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:26,370
[HANCOCK] Detestable!

251
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:29,073
Uselessly adorable obstacles!

252
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:34,245
Ahh! We love you, Princess!

253
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:35,913
[AMAZON 417A]
If I was half as sexy as her,

254
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:37,748
I'd spend all day
in front of a mirror!

255
00:12:37,782 --> 00:12:39,850
[AMAZON 417B] She's even
more striking than usual!

256
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,752
I didn't think
that was possible!

257
00:12:41,786 --> 00:12:43,287
My deepest apologies!

258
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,990
I accept full responsibility!

259
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:47,925
You should be more careful.

260
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,828
Hey! Looks like
you're feeling all better!

261
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:56,767
[LUFFY] Hate to be rude,
but we gotta hurry, Snake Lady!

262
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:58,068
[HANCOCK]
I can't look him in the eye.

263
00:12:58,102 --> 00:12:59,436
It's too much.

264
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,905
That's rude, Luffy!

265
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:02,773
You can't call her Snake Lady!

266
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:05,476
It's Snake Princess!
Don't forget it!

267
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,847
You can simply
call me Hancock if you like.

268
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,817
Ahh! You're so cute!

269
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,853
Cool! Whatever works
for you, Hammock!

270
00:13:15,886 --> 00:13:17,087
It's, ah, "Hancock."

271
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:19,390
The Snake Princess
just smiled at me!

272
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,891
It's like a diamond!

273
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,793
No, it's like
the stars in the sky!

274
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:24,094
Color me dazzled!

275
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:25,963
The spark of a woman in love!

276
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:28,532
It makes me long for
the sweet days of my youth!

277
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:30,367
Oh my! Is something
wrong, Granny Nyon?

278
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,236
Your face is
looking rather grotesque!

279
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,238
How dare you!

280
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:40,978
[NERINE] Have a safe trip,
Snake Princess!

281
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:42,379
[AMAZON 417F]
We'll miss you, Luffy!

282
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:44,181
[AMAZON 417G] Come back soon!

283
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:46,050
Bye bye!

284
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,418
Would you stop that?

285
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,522
[APHELANDRA] Bye!

286
00:13:51,555 --> 00:13:53,991
We're serious
about you coming back!

287
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:57,328
Indeed, we'll await your
return with bated breath!

288
00:13:57,361 --> 00:13:59,864
[laughing]

289
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:03,167
[LUFFY] Yeah! It's done!

290
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,537
[LUFFY yelling]

291
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,045
I had no
obligation to save you.

292
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,549
Whoa! This is great!

293
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:20,050
I was really freaking out there!

294
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:22,052
I thought you guys
were gonna die!

295
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:24,555
Gum-Gum Belly Talk!

296
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:30,594
[laughing]

297
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,367
Hey! Luffy!

298
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,469
I hope you get to
see your friends soon!

299
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,337
[LUFFY] Thanks!

300
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,043
[ENISHIDA] Granny Nyon.

301
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:47,878
I'm not worried
about the Snake Princess

302
00:14:47,912 --> 00:14:49,246
reaching the prison unharmed,

303
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,516
but how will she manage
to bring Luffy with her?

304
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:56,520
Well, it will require some
trickery, I can say that.

305
00:14:56,553 --> 00:15:00,090
The man has a 300 million
Berry bounty on his head.

306
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:02,893
And I'm certain that the
Navy is eager to apprehend him

307
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:05,596
after what happened on Sabaody.

308
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:09,033
But she can't very well
stow him in the cargo.

309
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:10,567
Nyo need to worry.

310
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:12,369
I thought up an
excellent strategy

311
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:18,709
and our princess
can be quite persuasive.

312
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:50,040
[MOMONGA] You certainly
kept us waiting, Empress.

313
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,343
In fact, I'd almost lost hope.

314
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,913
[HANCOCK] Can you
guarantee that you'll honor

315
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:58,849
the promise you made earlier?

316
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:00,851
I contacted my superiors.

317
00:16:00,884 --> 00:16:04,288
As long as we're quick about it,
we can stop by Impel Down.

318
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:08,125
To be clear,

319
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:10,494
only you and
your snake may board.

320
00:16:10,527 --> 00:16:11,628
Unless they're shackled,

321
00:16:11,662 --> 00:16:15,466
pirates are not welcome
at the prison, Warlord or no.

322
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:17,434
They'll make an exception once.

323
00:16:17,468 --> 00:16:18,936
But know this:

324
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:20,871
They'll watch you like a hawk.

325
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:22,906
You can't intimidate me.

326
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:26,910
Whatever you do,
please try to stay safe.

327
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,580
Strike down all
who oppose you, sister.

328
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,415
[AMAZON 417H] Good luck in
the battle with Whitebeard,

329
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,983
Snake Princess!

330
00:16:33,017 --> 00:16:34,318
Luffy, I hope y--

331
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,124
I shall return soon.

332
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:41,992
Guard the kingdom in my absence.

333
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:43,427
Of course!

334
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:49,166
[MOMONGA]
I'm glad I stuck around.

335
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,302
I feared I might have to return
to headquarters a failure.

336
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:56,373
You were so adamant
in your refusal

337
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:58,409
when last we spoke,
so you'll forgive me

338
00:16:58,442 --> 00:16:59,376
if I ask what happened

339
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,812
--to change your mind.
--[stomach growling]

340
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:05,282
Hold your tongue all you like,

341
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,885
but it seems your
stomach will still speak.

342
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:10,621
Even the great Pirate
Empress is only human.

343
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,822
How dare you!

344
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:14,425
A lady such as myself would
never do something so crass!

345
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,993
There's no one else here.

346
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:17,394
Of course not!

347
00:17:20,197 --> 00:17:21,165
Luffy.

348
00:17:21,198 --> 00:17:23,300
I'm sorry! I didn't eat
enough at the banquet

349
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,936
with all those girls chasing
me around and touching me!

350
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:28,338
Regardless, if we get
caught here, it's all over.

351
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:30,307
I'll ask for food later,
I promise.

352
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,076
Just tell your
stomach to be patient.

353
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:33,077
[LUFFY] Got it.

354
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,178
And Luffy...

355
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:36,480
It's difficult to walk
like this. Can you move up?

356
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,015
Uh-huh.

357
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:39,049
[gasps]

358
00:17:41,618 --> 00:17:43,420
You don't have
a fever, do you?

359
00:17:43,454 --> 00:17:44,555
You're quite flushed.

360
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:48,058
No, everything is fine.

361
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:49,626
Well...

362
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,562
While you're here,
do you think you can change back

363
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:54,164
my crewmembers
that you turned to stone?

364
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,334
It would be shameful to show up
at Navy Headquarters in this...

365
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,137
...unsightly state.

366
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,640
[MOMONGA] They are alive,
aren't they?

367
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:05,109
[LUFFY sneezes]

368
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,145
That sneeze.
It sounded like a man was--

369
00:18:08,178 --> 00:18:09,346
It was me!

370
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:12,649
[sneezes manly]

371
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:14,418
This wind is
bad for your health!

372
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:16,620
I may be catching a cold!

373
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:17,754
Sorry!

374
00:18:17,788 --> 00:18:20,224
I'm trying to be quiet,
but your hair tickled my nose!

375
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:22,359
It's all right,
I don't think he's onto us.

376
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,629
I don't know what it is yet,
but you're up to something,

377
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:29,066
and I swear I'll
get to the bottom of it.

378
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:31,602
Would you care to elaborate?

379
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:34,338
Aside from the fact that you're
acting highly suspicious,

380
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:35,939
your demeanor is
completely different

381
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:37,441
than when I met with you before.

382
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:38,342
We're screwed!

383
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,343
I assure you--

384
00:18:39,376 --> 00:18:42,012
I have nothing to hide
in either body or mind.

385
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:43,080
But if you have any doubts,

386
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:45,516
then I would encourage you
to search me yourself,

387
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:47,317
if you think you are capable.

388
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,487
Well then?

389
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:52,289
What shall it be?

390
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:57,227
What the heck do you
think you're doing?

391
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,163
He's gonna find me!

392
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:09,306
No.

393
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:12,743
If you insist, there's no
reason to doubt your word.

394
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,379
[MOMONGA] But I will have
to ask you to fix my crew.

395
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:17,281
We can scarcely
operate the ship,

396
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:20,450
let alone make your
little trip to Impel Down.

397
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,254
Awaken.

398
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:29,259
[MARINES] Hancock!

399
00:19:31,728 --> 00:19:33,297
Huh? What happened?

400
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,065
[MOMONGA]
Get ready for departure!

401
00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:36,033
[MARINES]
Yes sir!

402
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,201
[MARINE 417A]
Right away!

403
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,373
We'll make a stop at Impel Down
before we return to Marineford!

404
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:50,681
[MARINE CURLY]
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

405
00:19:50,714 --> 00:19:53,083
We have word from
Vice Admiral Momonga!

406
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:58,021
Snake Princess Boa Hancock
came to speak with him again.

407
00:19:58,055 --> 00:20:00,023
She finally agreed
to our conditions.

408
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:02,359
I'm told that they're
on their way now.

409
00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:03,727
It's about time.

410
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,296
Let's just hope
they're not late.

411
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,266
That woman is quite formidable.

412
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,203
Now we'll have
6 of the 7 Warlords with us.

413
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:15,505
Hawk-eye Mihawk.

414
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:17,808
Bartholomew Kuma.

415
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,744
Don Quixote Doflamingo.

416
00:20:20,777 --> 00:20:22,813
Gecko Moria.

417
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,515
Marshall D. Teach.

418
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:28,652
And Boa Hancock.

419
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,586
And the Seventh?

420
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,289
Did a little time
in prison cool his head?

421
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:34,458
Perhaps he's ready
to aid in our fight now?

422
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:35,525
No sir.

423
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,560
Just as before,

424
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:38,829
he's adamantly
refusing to fight.

425
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,796
He went so far as to say

426
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,799
he would relinquish
his title as Warlord.

427
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,535
Given his disposition,
I had assumed that he would be

428
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:47,638
the most cooperative
of the bunch.

429
00:20:47,671 --> 00:20:50,841
This is not the time
to get hung up on principle.

430
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,210
We need you, Jimbei.

431
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:57,180
Fleet Admiral, sir.

432
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,615
I have an announcement.

433
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:00,851
We have a small issue
with the 500 pirates

434
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,720
that Admiral Kizaru
captured at Sabaody.

435
00:21:03,754 --> 00:21:04,788
That is to say,

436
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:07,424
the staff at Impel Down
said they can't hold them.

437
00:21:07,457 --> 00:21:09,126
[SENGOKU]
Send them to a labor camp.

438
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:11,261
Frankly, if it doesn't
have to do with Whitebeard,

439
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,363
I just don't have
time for it right now.

440
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,132
[MARINE SCARFACE]
I understand sir, but...

441
00:21:15,165 --> 00:21:17,134
Saint Roswald is, uh...

442
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:19,503
Ugh, let the Admirals
handle it for once!

443
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:21,505
And where the hell is Garp?

444
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:22,539
I thought he informed you, sir,

445
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,642
but he left for Impel Down
quite some time ago.

446
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,845
I guess I should expect
that kind of behavior

447
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:31,648
from that old bastard,
but not before a battle!

448
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:33,116
[MARINE SIDEBURNS]
Excuse me, sir!

449
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,618
I'm afraid we have a situation.

450
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:36,353
Whitebeard's ship is advancing!

451
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:37,187
[SENGOKU] Hm?

452
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,055
I see.

453
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,157
I assume the guard ships
are on the line?

454
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,192
Put me through, I'd rather
speak to them directly.

455
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:43,894
[MARINE SIDEBURNS]
I can't do that.

456
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,429
We lost contact, sir.

457
00:21:45,462 --> 00:21:47,731
With all 23 Navy
vessels keeping tabs

458
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,600
on Whitebeard's main ship,
the Moby Dick...

459
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:51,802
Given the circumstances,

460
00:21:51,835 --> 00:21:55,339
we can only conclude they
were eliminated by the enemy.

461
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:58,342
[SENGOKU]
Surely not the whole fleet?

462
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,643
[MARINE SIDEBURNS] There's
been some worrying activity

463
00:21:59,676 --> 00:22:02,379
from other pirate ships
in the New World, as well.

464
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:03,547
Without guard ships,

465
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,382
we won't have any
idea how many ships

466
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:08,251
the enemy is sending,
or when he's sending them.

467
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,388
I've arranged for replacements,
but we're in the dark right now.

468
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,325
We've been had.

469
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,695
I didn't think they
would act so quickly.

470
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:21,498
Until new ships are
in place, we're flying blind.

471
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:23,266
As long as Ace is there,

472
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,670
they may even have the
audacity to strike Impel Down.

473
00:22:26,703 --> 00:22:28,305
So be ready for anything.

474
00:22:28,338 --> 00:22:29,406
[MARINES] Yes sir!

475
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:35,645
[GUARD 417A] Vice Admiral.

476
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,247
It will be right this way.

477
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,783
Please be careful.

478
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,318
[GARP] Sure.

479
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,396
[GARP] You're a right mess, boy.

480
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:54,297
I hate to see it.

481
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,774
[GARP]
You still breathing in there...

482
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,677
...Ace?

483
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,486
[NARRATOR] Sent flying
across the world by Kuma,

484
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,489
the Straw Hats awaken
in strange new places.

485
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,225
Nami meets a peculiar
old man on a secluded island

486
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:23,860
where a unique
science is studied,

487
00:23:23,894 --> 00:23:26,463
and Franky finds himself
in a frozen land

488
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:28,665
with no cola in sight.

489
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,367
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

490
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,701
The Friends' Whereabouts!

491
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:34,504
The Science of Weather
and the Mechanical Island!

492
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,873
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
