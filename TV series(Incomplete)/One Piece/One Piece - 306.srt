hold my breath any longer!

349
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,500
[NAMI] It hurts too much.

350
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:43,804
Everything's starting
to go dark. Someone help.

351
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:46,740
[KOKORO] It's alright.
Just hang in there.

352
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:49,342
I'm not gonna let you die.

353
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:54,148
[ZORO] What? What's going on?

354
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:57,083
It feels like
something's pulling me.

355
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:08,529
[SANJI] Uh--Uh...

356
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:13,099
Am I hallucinating?
That's gotta be it.

357
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:19,173
[SANJI] It's just like those old
tales that sailors talk about.

358
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:22,742
Just before they drown,
they see an elegant tail fin.

359
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:30,184
[SANJI] They look up, surprised
to see long flowing hair.

360
00:22:30,217 --> 00:22:33,454
I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

361
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:36,223
It's like she's something
out of a dream;

362
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:38,458
a legendary mermaid.

363
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:44,665
[SANJI] If I'm dying,
and this is just a dream...

364
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:45,699
then I don't wanna wake--

365
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,102
I'm swimmin' as fast
as this tail will let me!

366
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:50,304
None of you are gonna
die on my watch!

367
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:51,505
Ah...

368
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:52,772
Aaah...

369
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:55,676
Bah...

370
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:56,810
[BOTH] Aah...

371
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:58,379
Aaahhh!

372
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:00,180
[SANJI] She's the mermaid?

373
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:05,685
[laughing]

374
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:16,397
[FRANKY]
The hell? Seriously.

375
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,266
What kind of madness
is this Buster Call?

376
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:22,570
Hey! Hurry it up!
C'mon, Straw Hat!

377
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:25,205
Your friends--
your friends are here!

378
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,308
They're waiting for ya!

379
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:29,143
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece"

380
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:33,147
"Cannon Fire Sinks the Island!
Franky's Lamentation."

381
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,582
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
