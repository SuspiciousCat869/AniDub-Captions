1
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:50,790
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,250
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,919
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,588
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,091
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:04,429
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,226
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:18,026
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:22,530
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:25,742
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:27,827
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:32,916
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:38,213
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:42,133
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:45,053
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,013
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:52,394
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:54,270
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:59,234
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:01,277
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:07,033
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:14,124
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:21,923
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:32,475
[LUFFY laughs]

25
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:39,524
Gum-Gum Balloon!

26
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,902
[grunts]

27
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:52,412
Nami?

28
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:54,247
We've been had!

29
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,292
My treasure!

30
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:01,046
[LUFFY]
"The Pirate Ship Disappears!

31
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,256
Fortress Battle, Round #2!"

32
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:20,815
[DRAKE]
They're getting away!

33
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:22,567
All ships full speed!

34
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,568
Now!

35
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:24,819
[NAVIGATOR]
But, sir!

36
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:26,946
With all due respect,
we're in shallow waters!

37
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,656
If we sail headlong
into that smoke,

38
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,367
we run the risk of
hitting the reef!

39
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,619
[DRAKE]
I said full speed ahead!

40
00:03:32,702 --> 00:03:33,870
[NAVIGATOR]
But, sir!

41
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:35,372
Do you know what's
going to happen if we let

42
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:38,667
those pirates escape from us?
This fortress and everyone

43
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,461
who serves here will become the
laughingstock of the Marines,

44
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:43,922
we'll be synonymous
with failure!

45
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:45,215
[NAVIGATOR]
We will?

46
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:47,550
You really think so, Lieutenant?

47
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:49,135
[DRAKE]
I know so!

48
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:52,681
And in fact, I'm sure this will
be the last straw for Navarone!

49
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:55,684
Those bigwigs at HQ have
been waiting for an excuse

50
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:58,019
to shut us down
once and for all!

51
00:03:58,103 --> 00:04:00,313
Do you understand me, sailor?!

52
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:01,481
[NAVIGATOR grumbles]

53
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:02,816
[DRAKE]
So tell me!

54
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:05,819
Are you going to allow that
to happen to Navarone?

55
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:06,903
No, sir!

56
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:10,907
Attention, all ships!

57
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,910
Full speed ahead!
Sail through the Sea Gate!

58
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:23,086
[LUFFY laughing]
Whoa!

59
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,381
The open sea! Keep her
on a straight course, guys!

60
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:27,841
[NAMI]
No, turn around!

61
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:29,092
Huh?

62
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:31,678
We can't leave yet!
Full reverse!

63
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:32,846
Don't just stand there!

64
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:35,390
Those lousy Marines
stole all our gold!

65
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:38,685
Turn us around! We have to go
back to the fortress right now!

66
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:40,103
Are you nuts?

67
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:42,731
Maybe you didn't notice,
Nami, but we almost got killed

68
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:43,815
breaking out of that place!

69
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:46,359
Zoro's right!
You're completely nuts!

70
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:49,571
I'm quite sane right now, thank
you! Look, what's the point

71
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:52,699
in escaping if it's without
all our hard-earned gold?

72
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:57,495
Wow, whenever money's involved,
Nami gets really serious.

73
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:59,581
I love that side of Nami, too!

74
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:01,875
But we're so close to
that big hole we made!

75
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,586
All we gotta do is just
sail through it ya know.

76
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:06,254
[NAMI] Hey, aren't we
supposed to be pirates?

77
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:07,756
[LUFFY]
Mm-hm.

78
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,716
Well, have you ever heard of
pirates leaving gold behind?

79
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:12,927
Wouldn't that be the worst
thing a pirate could do?

80
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:14,137
Yeah, I guess.

81
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,140
So, it's decided then!
Let's get our treasure!

82
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:18,641
Crew, make a U-turn and take us

83
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:20,977
back to the fortress
on the double!

84
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:22,520
--[CHOPPER] Got it!
-- [SANJI] Aye!

85
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:24,564
Anything for you, Captain Nami!

86
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:25,648
[CHOPPER]
Right rudder, full!

87
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:26,775
[SANJI]
U-Turn!

88
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:32,364
Hold on, you guys!

89
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:33,782
What are they doing?

90
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:35,575
Hey! Be careful!

91
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:47,504
[NAMI] That's it, guys!
Just keep it up!

92
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:49,339
[bells clanging]

93
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:50,256
[gasps]

94
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:57,138
Sound the alarm bell!
Much louder!

95
00:05:57,222 --> 00:06:00,183
With all this smoke, it's the
only way we can avoid collisions

96
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,017
with our fellow ships!

97
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:05,105
[bells clanging]

98
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,107
[LUFFY]
You hear that?

99
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,942
Please be quiet, Luffy!

100
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:11,986
Sounds like wind chimes.

101
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,906
They're alarm bells. You use
them to signal your location

102
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:16,825
to other ships when
you're in a fog!

103
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:18,910
[bells continue clanging]

104
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:22,247
And those sound like they're
coming straight toward us!

105
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,333
How was that, Nami? Should we
keep her on a rightward course?

106
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,544
[NAMI]
No! Left rudder, full!

107
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:29,045
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

108
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,755
[NAMI] If we don't, we're
gonna crash into that big ship

109
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,591
that's headed right for us!

110
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:36,344
Anything for you,
my sweet thing!

111
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:41,474
[bells continue clanging]

112
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:42,726
[USOPP yelps]

113
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:44,477
[gasps]

114
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:46,771
[NAMI]
We're gonna crash!

115
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:59,868
Hah, that sure was close.
To think we almost died without

116
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:02,662
ever laying eyes
on our gold again...

117
00:07:04,497 --> 00:07:06,875
How do things look up ahead?
Is the coast clear?

118
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,294
[bells clanging rapidly]

119
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:10,587
Uh, oh!

120
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,505
[LUFFY] Sounds like a lot
more than last time!

121
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:16,843
I see one, two, oh, no!

122
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:20,138
There's a whole flotilla
of ships bearing down on us!

123
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:24,351
We're dead meat!

124
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:27,937
So, Nami?

125
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:30,607
What'll it be, my sweet?
Left rudder or right rudder?

126
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,567
--[NAMI] Left! Quickly!
--[BOTH] Huh?

127
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,861
If we don't we're gonna
get smashed to pieces!

128
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:35,779
[NAMI, USOPP, and ZORO groan]

129
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:37,655
What's going on out there?

130
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:40,784
I don't know! Just do
what Nami says, Chopper!

131
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:43,495
She's the best
navigator in the world!

132
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:48,750
Ah! I don't think
we're gonna make it!

133
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:51,503
[gasps]

134
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:55,340
[whimpering]

135
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,480
We... We made it.

136
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:12,982
Keep her headed straight, guys!

137
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:18,196
We can't keep sailing
blind like this!

138
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,032
It's too dangerous here! We've
gotta get out of this smoke!

139
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:22,867
Won't they spot us if we do?

140
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:24,953
Yeah! We'll be sitting ducks
once we leave this smoke!

141
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:26,746
Those ships'll take
aim and then boom!

142
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,289
They'll blast us to
the bottom of the ocean

143
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:31,501
and we'll be fish food!
I can't die yet.

144
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:33,837
[NAMI]
Do you have any better ideas?

145
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,880
--Miss Navigator...
--[NAMI] Huh?

146
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:38,008
I was able to do a
little bit of research.

147
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:41,302
It turns out that this fortress
used to station quite a lot more

148
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:43,763
troops and warships
than it currently does.

149
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:46,099
Uh...

150
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:47,642
Well, thank you for sharing,

151
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:50,478
but this is not the time for
a stupid history lesson, Robin!

152
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:52,689
[ROBIN] It seems that this
fortress has been a victim of

153
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:56,067
military downsizing. As a
result, many of its areas

154
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:57,861
have been shut down,
and there are plenty

155
00:08:57,944 --> 00:09:00,238
of unused docks around the base.

156
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:02,574
Plenty of unused docks, huh?

157
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:06,077
That's great! Wow! Thanks,
Robin! You're a lifesaver!

158
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:07,996
Okay guys, here's the plan!

159
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:11,332
We're going to hide the Merry
in one of those old docks!

160
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,377
[USOPP] Uh? How do we
even know where to find one?

161
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:17,422
[NAMI] Just follow my
orders and this map!

162
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,352
[DRAKE]
What the...?

163
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,396
[grunts]

164
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:37,025
You there, call the
cannoneers at the sea gate!

165
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:39,235
Ask if the Straw Hat
ship passed through!

166
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:41,196
Yes, sir!

167
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,450
Sea Gate cannons! This is
Drake's flagship calling!

168
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:48,328
Have any of you spotted
the Straw Hats' ship?

169
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:49,537
What?

170
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:52,457
Sir! They say
the only ship that's

171
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,292
passed through the
sea gate is ours!

172
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,503
Just us?

173
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:58,046
Where are they?

174
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:00,590
They couldn't have snuck past
the canonneers sight unseen!

175
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:02,384
And then somehow sailed
off beyond the horizon

176
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:06,554
in such a short amount of time?
No, that would be impossible.

177
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:10,100
[SNAIL PHONE rings]

178
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:12,143
Huh?

179
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:13,395
I'm sorry Commander,

180
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:15,188
but it looks like the
pirates escaped, Sir.

181
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:17,482
We lost sight of them
when they hit the open sea.

182
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:18,858
I don't know how to explain it!

183
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:21,152
It's like they completely
vanished into thin air!

184
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:22,696
[JONATHAN]
Just as I thought.

185
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,197
[DRAKE]
Sir?

186
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,074
[JONATHAN] Never mind. You
and your men did well, Drake.

187
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:28,993
Now come on back to port. I'll
share with you my plan on how

188
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:32,163
we're going to catch
the Straw Hats.

189
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:36,668
They haven't gotten
away from us just yet.

190
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:39,212
Nor will they even try
while we still have what

191
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:42,048
they hold most dear
in this fortress.

192
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,356
[SHEPHERD] Unhand me this
instant or you'll be

193
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,234
court-martialed for insulting
a superior officer!

194
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:03,528
[GUARD A] Hear that?
He's gonna court-martial us!

195
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:04,821
[GUARD B]
Drop the act.

196
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:08,950
You two! Let that man go!

197
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:09,784
[[GUARD A, GUARD B]
Huh?

198
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:10,994
[GUARD A, GUARD B gasping]

199
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:13,121
Please accept
our apologies, Major!

200
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:14,414
[GUARD A, GUARD B gasping]

201
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:17,000
[SHEPHERD]
Finally figured it out, huh?

202
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,378
That I'm not some mangy pirate,
but a Special Inspector.

203
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:23,048
I'm Major Shepherd!

204
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:24,591
[JONATHAN]
Hmm...

205
00:11:24,674 --> 00:11:28,094
You Straw Hats are probably
holed up somewhere around here.

206
00:11:29,095 --> 00:11:31,973
Well in that case,
let the games continue.

207
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:34,726
All I need to do now
is sit back and wait.

208
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:36,728
You'll reveal yourselves.

209
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:40,940
[MARINE B] Man, searchin' for
those pirates is wearin' me out.

210
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:43,485
Well, this delicious food
should give us some energy,

211
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:45,737
and then it's back to searching.

212
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:49,741
Wait! This doesn't taste
anything like the food

213
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:51,242
from this morning!

214
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:53,036
You're right! Compared to the
eats we had this morning,

215
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:54,496
this stuff tastes like dirt!

216
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:56,456
Hey! Just what are you
cooks trying to pull here?

217
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:57,749
Give us some of the good grub!

218
00:11:57,832 --> 00:12:00,960
[MARINES] Give us good grub!
Give us good grub!

219
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,337
Jessica! Do you hear that?

220
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,130
The soldiers are
complaining about the food!

221
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:05,465
What do we do?

222
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:11,429
Jessica, please. You have to
let us use his recipes.

223
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:12,931
No way.

224
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:16,309
How dare you even suggest
such a thing in this kitchen.

225
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:17,477
[VICE HEAD CHEF]
Please, hear me out!

226
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,937
It's true that he was a pirate,

227
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,897
but he was still
an excellent cook!

228
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,484
His food tantalized the palates
of the soldiers who ate here.

229
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,821
Isn't that the goal of each and
every one of us in the kitchen?

230
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:29,406
The troops loved his cooking!

231
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:32,784
In fact, it's his food they're
asking for right now, Jessica!

232
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:35,203
So, what's it gonna be?
Please say yes!

233
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:37,080
We're begging you, Jessica!

234
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:39,165
[COOKS]
Please, Jessica!

235
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:48,341
[COOKS gasping]

236
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:49,843
All right, listen up!

237
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:51,553
We're going to learn how to
make food just as delicious

238
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:53,680
and mouth-watering
as the pirate's was.

239
00:12:53,763 --> 00:12:56,057
But as for today, we're
going to swallow our pride

240
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:59,185
and use his recipes
to feed our troops!

241
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:00,645
And you're right.

242
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:03,189
He wasn't a pirate when he
was working in this kitchen.

243
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:04,649
He was a cook.

244
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:08,695
[JESSICA] And he knew the most
important thing was to satisfy

245
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:10,113
the people eating his food!

246
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:11,573

Jessica!

247
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:13,283
[JESSICA] What are you
standing around for?

00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:14,659
We've got men to feed!

249
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:16,578
[COOKS]
Yeah!

250

[USOPP]
Well? What do we do now, guys?

251
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:24,502
[ZORO] If you ask me, I think
we should just head back to the

252
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:27,130
gate and make a break for
it while we still can.

253
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:29,549
You've got a point there.
The Marines mean business.

254
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:31,593
It's too bad we have to
leave the gold behind,

255
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,303
but our lives
are more important.

256
00:13:33,386 --> 00:13:36,139
You're the captain, Luffy.
What do you think?

257
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:40,518
We need to get our gold, but
I need something to eat first!

258
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:43,897
I heard ya. Gimme a sec
and I'll whip something up.

259
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,941

looked kinda empty.

Just so I understand you
correctly, you guys are okay

263
00:13:56,326 --> 00:13:58,370
with us leaving this
place without our gold?

264
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:00,163
[CHOPPER, ZORO, LUFFY, USOPP]
Mm-hmm.

265
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:01,748
Well, that's too bad,
'cause you know,

266
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:03,833
pirate treasure is
always divided up.

267
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,543
Even after
splitting up the loot,

268
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,754
we'd all have more gold than
we'd know what to do with.

269
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:10,131
Just think of all the
stuff we could have bought.

270
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:12,801
Hey, wait! I wanna go
and buy some stuff!

271
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:14,302
[NAMI]
Like what?

272
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,555
Ooh, I'll tell you what I
wanna buy! A big gold statue!

273
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,848
Ooh, Nami, over here!

274
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:20,684
I wanna buy a bunch
of new medical books!

275
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,060
Ones that that'll
teach me all about

276
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:25,230
the latest medical
procedures and operations!

277
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:28,650
New pots, frying pans,
silverware, giant mousetrap...

278
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,026
Wow, even after all that,

279
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,404
there'll still be
a lot left over.

280
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:34,364
I could buy lotsa booze.

281
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:36,408
--[NAMI] Right.
--[ALL] Uh-huh.

282
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:39,661
But first, I take an
extra cut: 80 percent!

283

Are you nuts?!

284
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:42,831
It's not for me.

285
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:45,417
Oh, yeah? Then who? And why
should they receive a bigger

286
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,002
share than the rest of us, huh?!

287
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:50,130
It's for a special lady.
We're going to set aside

288
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:52,924
the gold to pay for the
repairs we need to make.

289
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:55,969
A lady? Oh, wait,
you mean the Merry?

290
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:57,554
[NAMI]
That's right.

291
00:14:57,637 --> 00:14:59,973
Isn't it about time we paid her
back for all she's done for us?

292
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:01,558
Well, come to think of it,

293
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:04,769
the Going Merry has carried us
for a long time now, hasn't she?

294
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:08,690
Ever since I joined up and left
my village in the East Blue.

295
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,191
[MERRY]
It's a slightly older model,

296
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:13,987
but I personally designed
it and she sails like a dream.

297
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,864
She has a carvel-make caravel

298
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:18,658
with lateen sails and
a central stern rudder.

299
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:20,744
She's a fine ship
and her name...

300
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:22,579
...is the Going Merry!

301
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:24,748
Get on already!

302
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:25,665
Huh?

00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:27,959
We're friends, right? So get on.

00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:32,756
[USOPP] This is it.
I'm really a pirate captain now!

305
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:35,759
[LUFFY] Don't be stupid,
Usopp! I'm the captain!

[ZORO, NAMI, LUFFY laughing]

307
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:40,680
We've had so many adventures.

308
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:43,683
Lots of good times and
made so many memories.

309
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:49,731
And me? I'm finally
gonna leave this island.

310
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:55,278
[NAMI]
I'm going now, o-okay?

311
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,076
[NAMI gasps]

312
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:25,058
[NAMI]
I'm off.

313
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:31,356
Hey, don't forget. The Merry
was also with us when we crossed

314
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:34,734
that crazy Reverse Mountain,
and burst into the Grand Line.

315
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:36,903
I've gotta be dreaming!

316
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:38,363
It's impossible.

317
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:41,491
The ocean really is
flowing up the mountain!

318
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:44,327
[SANJI, USOPP]
We made it!

319
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:48,581
[LUFFY]
Whoa!

320
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:51,292
Look how high we are!
We're in the clouds!

321
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:53,545
Woo-hoo!

322
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,549
[LUFFY]
This is insane!

323
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:00,218
[gasps]

324
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:01,678
[LUFFY]
I can see it!

325
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:04,723
This is the greatest
sea in the whole world!

326
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,307
The Grand Line!

327
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,685
Somewhere out there
the One Piece is waiting!

328
00:17:08,768 --> 00:17:10,687
And we're gonna find it!

329
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,647
Let's go!

330
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:17,360
Don't forget sky island.

331
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:24,159
Trust me.
I'm a navigator, aren't I?

332
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:26,411
[SANJI]
Thank you, Nami!

333
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:29,205
All right, gang!
Nami's leadin' the way!

334
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,207
[LUFFY, CHOPPER, USOPP, ZORO]
Yeah!

335
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,251
[LUFFY]
We're flying!

336
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,672
Yeah! We're headed to the sky!

337
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,467
Nami! Good job!

338
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,761
I think I love you!

339
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,847
Yeah, I even risked
my life to save it

340
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,350
when it was carried
to Upper Yard!

341
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:51,811
[CHOPPER whimpers]

342
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:53,480
[screams]

343
00:17:53,563 --> 00:17:55,273
[CHOPPER]
Stop it! Please!

344
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:57,067
Just stop burning the ship!

345
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:01,529
This is gonna hurt.

346
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:06,159
[CHOPPER yells]

347
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:12,874
Yeah, then that mysterious
someone fixed the ship for us.

348
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:14,042
[thud]

349
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:24,010
I saw somebody, I swear!

350
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:25,387
When you think about it,

351
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,056
this ship's gone
through a lot for us.

352
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:40,860
And that's exactly why
we need to give her

353
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:42,404
some tender, loving care.

354
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:46,116
[USOPP] Good idea!
The Going Merry's Great Repair!

355
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,909
[LUFFY]
Let's do it!

356
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:50,829
It's settled! And since we don't
know how much the repairs'll be,

357
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:54,499
we'll just hold off dividing
up the treasure until we do.

358
00:18:54,582 --> 00:18:56,918
[SANJI] Those goons took all
the food from the storeroom,

359
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,337
but lucky for us,
they didn't touch the fridge.

360
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:00,880
Here. Dig in.

361
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:03,508
Huh. I've been wondering
how much longer

362
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:06,094
Usopp's half-ass
repairs were gonna last.

363
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:08,471
Hey, I'm a sniper,
not a shipwright!

364
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:10,223
But yeah, Mechao
said the same thing.

365
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:12,892
It needs professional repairs.

366
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:16,021
Yeah, right. It's time we took
the Merry to a real shipyard,

367
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:17,772
and got some honest-to-
goodness shipwrights

368
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,233
to give her the
repairs she needs.

369
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:23,403
So, there are people who can
fix ships better than Usopp?

370
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:25,780
Yep! Sometimes when you
need a job done right,

371
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,657
you've gotta go see
a professional!

372
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,075
[LUFFY]
That's it!

373
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:32,495
We've gotta get a
shipwright for our crew!

374
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,539
Our journey's far
from over, right?

375
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:36,291
[USOPP, ZORO, NAMI, CHOPPER]
Mm.

376
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:38,918
[LUFFY] We really need
someone with those skills.

377
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:40,920
[USOPP, ZORO, NAMI, CHOPPER]
Mm-hmm.

378
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:43,340
And the Merry
isn't just our ship!

379
00:19:43,423 --> 00:19:44,966
She's our home, too!

380
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,720
So let's go find us a shipwright
who can keep the Merry safe!

381
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,599
Well, I'm impressed.

382
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:54,434
Whoa. He got to the point.

383
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:56,019
That's pretty rare.

384
00:19:56,102 --> 00:19:59,147
Well, that sounds really good
to me, Luffy! Let's go do it!

385
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,899
Uh... That's what I just said!

386
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:03,318
I just hope we can
find somebody good!

387
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:04,986
We should get a musician, too!

388
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,447
Let's forget that one.

389
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,240
The shipwright's a great idea,

390
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:10,950
but haven't you all
forgotten something?

391
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:12,369
[CHOPPER, LUFFY, USOPP, ZORO]
What's that?

392
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:15,497
[NAMI] We have to get
our gold back first!

393
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,998
[LUFFY]
Oh, yeah, right.

394
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:21,044
Well, do we have any idea
where they may have taken it?

395
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:22,587
[USOPP]
To a vault, I bet.

396
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:24,756
Well, duh, genius! Where else?

397
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:27,634
The problem is we have no clue
where that vault may be!

398
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:29,427
[USOPP]
Hey, you don't hafta be rude!

399
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:31,012
I'd say here.

400
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,515
It's just a guess, of course,
but if I were going to hide gold

401
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:36,017
inside Navarone,
this multi-lock storage vault

402
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:39,270
seems like it would
be the ideal place.

403
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:40,855
You're so smart!

404
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,067
You're right! That does seem
like the most obvious place!

405
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,443
All right, guys!

406
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:47,779
Let's go bust into that vault
and get our gold back!

407
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:49,406
But what do we do
about the Merry?

408
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:50,615
We can't just leave her here!

409
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:53,201
She's sure to get
spotted eventually!

410
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,329
"Hide a tree in a forest

411
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:59,082
and hide a big ship
among big ships!"

412
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,253
[NAMI, SANJI, USOPP sighing]

413
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:05,338
So, that's your big plan?

414
00:21:05,422 --> 00:21:08,550
I think I liked you better
when you weren't so serious.

415
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,885
I don't know if it'll help
or not, but we are at a dock

416
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,596
where ships used to be
constructed and repaired.

417
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,057
When we sailed in just now,
I couldn't help but notice

418
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:19,352
an abundance of abandoned
materials lying around.

419
00:21:19,436 --> 00:21:22,272
Ya don't say! Well,
that gives me a great idea!

420
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:25,567
[USOPP whispering]

421
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,651
[USOPP]
Well?

422
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:28,028
[ALL]
Yeah!

423
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:32,657
[hammering]

424
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,079
[USOPP sighs]

425
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:43,001
[USOPP]
Well... Whaddaya think, guys?

426
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,628
Not bad if I do say so myself!
At least we don't have to worry

427
00:21:45,712 --> 00:21:48,048
about the Merry getting
stolen again, right?

428
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,596
[ZORO] Gluing paper all over
the ship to disguise it...

429
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:55,722
What a great idea.

430
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:56,931
[SANJI]
I don't know, guys.

431
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,308
It looks like
a three-year-old did it.

432
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:00,560
You think that's gonna
fool anyone for very long?

433
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:02,937
Yeah, of course it will!
It looks just like one of

434
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,065
the Marine's warships,
no doubt about it!

435
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:07,359
--It sure does!
--You're nuts!

436
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:08,693
Great!

437
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:10,779
Now all we have to do
is get our treasure back!

438
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:14,449
Operation Gold Recovery
commences at midnight! Got it?

439
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:15,700
[ALL]
Got it!

440
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:17,827
[CHOPPER]
Um, why don't we go right now?

441
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:19,913
[LUFFY] Well, 'cause
super-secret missions are

442
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:21,206
always better at midnight!

443
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:23,375
[CHOPPER]
Oh, I get it now!

444
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,169
[USOPP]
Um, you guys are joking, right?

445
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:39,683
<i>A future lies before us</i>

[USOPP] Now we don't have to
worry about the Merry, but wait!

461
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:45,707
Hold on, you guys!

462
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,208
Are we just gonna go like this?

463
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,961
Jeez! Seven people running
around will stand out too much!
