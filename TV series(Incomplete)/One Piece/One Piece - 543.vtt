[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.757
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.693
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.992
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.861
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:47.100
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.269
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:50.637
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.906
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.807
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.210
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:59.913
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.584
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.152
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:09.856
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.993
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.431
[NARRATOR] The first
stop on Luffy's journey

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:21.334
is Fishman Island, thousands
of feet below sea level,

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:24.003
where his crew becomes
involved in a civil war.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.939
Meeting Jimbei,
they learn of the events

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:27.373
that led to the conflict.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:29.776
He tells a tale of
the Fishman Pirates,

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:33.846
the island's brave queen,
and its hero, Fisher Tiger.

[KOALA gasps]

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:44.224
We are nothing like those
evil Celestial Dragons.

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:47.193
So, don't you dare
act like we are.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.661
Now watch.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.439
[gasps]

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:02.709
No killing--not now, not ever!

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:05.044
No matter how far the journey...

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:09.382

this girl back home!

[SUN PIRATE D]
It took a while,

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:25.265
but we finally got an Eternal
Pose to Koala's hometown!

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:27.333
[HACHI]
Nyu! You hear that, Koala?

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.102
You can go back to your family!

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:31.304
[KOALA]
Um, really?

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:35.475
[laughs]

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:38.311
Well, aren't you pretty!
Your parents will be proud

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:42.115
to see what a fine
young lady you've become.

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:44.517
I don't look silly?

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.554
[SUN PIRATES laugh]

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:50.423
We got rid of those
old rags of yours.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.258
You don't want them back, right?

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.493
[KOALA grunts]

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.228
You may feel awkward at first,

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:57.864
but I promise your
mom'll be happy.

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:03.836
I should clean.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.206
Nyu! You gotta break that
weird habit of yours, okay?

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.310
You're just a normal girl!
This isn't Marie Jois!

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.178
Ah, just let her
do what she wants.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:13.079
[HACHI]
Nyu?

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:14.681
[ALADDIN]
The girl was traumatized.

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:16.783
You can't expect her
to stop that easily.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.618
These things take time.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.686
Sorry.

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.487
You should listen to Aladdin.

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:22.789
He would know.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:23.956
[ALADDIN growls]

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.093
Because you were a slave
once yourself, weren't you?

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:30.196
But those feelings might be
better served if you killed her.

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.464
[KOALA gasps]

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.466
Former slave
or not, she's human.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.401
Just like the ones
who owned you.

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.437
I think we've heard
enough, Arlong.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.673
Let me ask you a little
question. Tell me the truth.

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.375
Even though we spared your life,

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:45.378
I bet your parents don't
give a damn about Fishmen.

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:51.017
[laughing]

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.619
Humans think they're
superior to everyone!

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:55.355
That's why there's
no point in saving

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:58.758
a so-called "innocent child,"
because all of them are guilty!

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:01.627
She'll go home, and
she'll learn to hate us.

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:04.063
It won't stop
until we stop them!

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:06.733
Until we take them down a peg!

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:10.002
[ARLONG]
But you know that, right?

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:12.972
You've seen the way they
look at us, haven't you?

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:17.276
The fear, the contempt
in their eyes.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.978
If it were my decision,

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:21.848

five feet under right now.

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.066
Is that so?

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:44.637
I see fear, but that
is not the same as contempt.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.676
Is it because we're pirates?

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.811
[KOALA gasps]

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.982
Why are you so afraid of us?

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:02.889
'Cause I... I don't
know much about you.

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:08.127
I've heard that before.

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:09.862
[OTOHIME]
It's true that our only exposure

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:11.497
to humans has been negative.

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:15.468
But, that doesn't mean we
can judge all humans the same!

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:20.072

That's all it takes!

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:51.971
[KOALA] Uncle Tiger!
You can't sneak off yet!

00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:59.078
Thanks! I'll miss
you! Take care now!

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:02.448
I'll never forget you!
Not for the rest of my life!

00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:05.518
And I won't forget Hachi
or Aladdin either!

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:07.386
Even if we never
see each other again,

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:10.689
in my heart, we'll
always be friends, okay?

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:16.662
I learned a lot! Thank you!

00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:21.133
[TIGER] I know these
things happen slowly,

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:22.968
but by the time you grow up,

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:26.539
I hope our people
can finally get along.

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:27.573
[TIGER grunts]

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:35.648
Ah, ha. There you are--
Fisher Tiger of the Sun Pirates.

00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:37.883
I'm Rear Admiral Strawberry.

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:41.720
We were informed that you might
be stopping on this island.

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:44.890
That girl was property
of the Celestial Dragons,

00:13:44.924 --> 00:13:47.393
but we're going to look the
other way on that matter--

00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:49.328
at least for the time being.

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:52.965
[STRAWBERRY] That is to say,
the village elders were more

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:56.535
than willing to sell you
out as long as we spared her.

00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:58.070
Do you know why I'm here?

00:13:58.103 --> 00:14:00.773
You must, so I won't
waste your time.

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:03.342
This is rather generous,
all things considered,

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:05.744
but you're facing two charges:

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:07.913
Assault and escape.

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:09.181
[TIGER grunts]

00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:18.991
[TIGER gasping]

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:39.778
[gunfire]

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:41.914
What the...? What in
the hell is going on?

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:44.116
It's from the same
direction Boss was headed.

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:45.451
[JIMBEI] Surely, they
wouldn't attack him.

00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:46.952
[MACRO gasps]

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:48.654
[SUN PIRATE E]
Look! Out at sea!

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:50.189

Huh?

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:52.491
[CHOO]
Choo! It's the Navy!

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:53.692
We're surrounded!

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.227
What're they doing here?

00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:56.629
[ARLONG]
It was a damn trap!

00:14:56.662 --> 00:14:57.696
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.499
The brat was nothing
but a ploy to lure us here.

00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:02.868
They played us for fools.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.771
We show them an ounce of
kindness and this happens!

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:08.874
See? Humans are monsters!

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:19.885
[SUN PIRATES yelling]

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.254
Those bastards!

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:24.790
Wait, no.

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:27.026
It must be Tiger they want!

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:27.693
Hey!

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:28.861
[ARLONG]
Huh?

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:32.398
You guys, guard the boat!
I'm gonna go save the boss.

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:34.566
Good! We finally agree!

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.835
When you stop yappin'
and start throwin' punches,

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:38.904
I know you won't let me down!

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.307
[JIMBEI] I'll take that
as a compliment. Let's go!

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.074
[SUN PIRATES shouting]

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:43.976
Hey, Arlong, sir!

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:47.046
This is bad.
The ship is gonna sink!

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:48.881
Jump in the sea!

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:53.419
[ARLONG] Our ship's done for!
Let's hijack one of theirs!

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.321

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:04.763
[TIGER panting]

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.166
How is this monster
still fighting back?

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:08.567
We're plugging
him full of bullets

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.369
and he's just shrugging it off!

00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:14.340
A monster?

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:17.943
[TIGER]
You humans think I'm a monster?

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.611
We'll see!

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:20.813
Fire!

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.515
--[MEN, WOMEN cheering]
--[KOALA gasps]

00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:29.788
Did you hear that noise,
Mom? It was loud.

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:32.524
[gasps] What noise?

00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:35.861
I was right.

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:37.930
Boss!

00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:41.467
Rear Admiral, sir! The Sun
Pirates came to save Tiger!

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.903
I see, it's him. Yes.

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:46.171
Jimbei.

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:54.613
My friends... I'm sorry.

00:16:54.646 --> 00:16:57.082
[SUN PIRATES]
Boss!

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:59.018
Are you the one
responsible for this?

00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:01.053
I do it all for justice.

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:04.089
And justice demands
I crush criminals like you!

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:06.291
[JIMBEI]
Curse you!

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:07.826
[JIMBEI growls]

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.029
Do you want to die
with your captain?

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:12.831
You're not as strong
as you think, human!

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.837
[JIMBEI] We were able rescue
our boss from the Marines,

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:21.940
as planned, and although our
ship was sunk during battle,

00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:25.144
Arlong was able to secure
a new one from the enemy.

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:28.080
Then...

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.786
[SUN PIRATES]
What?!

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:35.988
[HACHI] What do ya mean
ya don't want a transfusion?

00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:38.323
Are you crazy?
You don't have time!

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:39.191
You're gonna die!

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:40.859
You've lost far too much blood.

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:43.662
Whatever your feelings are,
you must reconsider!

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:46.799
The boss has a very
rare blood type.

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:48.033
No one on the crew
is compatible,

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.935
so we need another option.

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:52.871
The blood they have
stocked on the ship

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:54.973
wouldn't be from Fishmen.

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:55.841
[groans]

00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:59.344
It would be human.

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:01.380
So, what? It should work.

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:03.882
Humans and Fishmen
share the same blood.

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.751
We found your type as well.

00:18:05.784 --> 00:18:07.252
So, it's settled, all right?

00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:09.488
[TIGER groans]

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:11.657
Now just relax. You're all good.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.092
Get away!

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:14.293
[SUN PIRATES gasp]

00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:17.329
I would rather die than
live with their blood!

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:23.102
[TIGER] I won't put
that filth in my body.

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:27.639
The blood of the bastards
who tried to kill me.

00:18:27.673 --> 00:18:29.708
Damn it, no.

00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:31.643
I won't take their mercy.

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.879
I will not owe them.

00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:36.982
I won't give in to
any human! I won't!

00:18:37.015 --> 00:18:39.618
[TIGER panting]

00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:41.086
What happened?

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.989
Something changed
for you to say this.

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:53.932
I didn't want to
tell you guys this.

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:55.634
But I...

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:58.003
...on my last trip...

00:18:58.036 --> 00:19:00.906
[JIMBEI] That was quite
a lengthy voyage you took!

00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:03.175
[TIGER]
Yeah, an eventful one, too.

00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:05.310
[NEPTUNE]
Tell me.

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:07.813
Why are you so
adamant about this?

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:09.948
What did you see on your trip?

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:14.686
I saw human nature.

00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:21.160
Soon after I started
off on my journey...

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:22.394
...they captured me.

[crying]

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:31.570
I was...

00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:34.873
...a damn slave!

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:36.208
Boss, no!

[ARLONG, ALADDIN, MACRO gasping]

00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:41.246
Tiger!

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:45.717
[TIGER]
I saw true human corruption...

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:48.086
...true depravity.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.557
I barely escaped, but then...

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.660
...I kept thinking
about those other slaves,

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:56.528
so I went back.

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:01.099
Listen to me.

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:04.903
I lived how I chose to--

00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:08.173
against Otohime's will.

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:11.410
But, I still believe in her.

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:16.148
[TIGER] I still
believe that she's right.

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:18.283
Everyone wants peace.

00:20:18.317 --> 00:20:21.420
Humans and Fishmen alike.

00:20:21.453 --> 00:20:24.923
But our generation
can't bring that peace.

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:27.793
We're bound to an ugly past.

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:30.128
Only children like Koala,

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:33.565
free of that history
can change the world.

00:20:37.102 --> 00:20:39.972
Please you can't tell them.

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:43.475
You... have to... hold it in.

00:20:43.508 --> 00:20:46.712
Our tragedy and our hatred.

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.747
They must die with us...

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.249
No, it's all wrong.

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:51.683
You heard me!

00:20:51.717 --> 00:20:55.220
[panting]

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.856
Some humans... are kind.

00:20:57.889 --> 00:21:01.326
They know...
we're not so different.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.128
I know it, too.

00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:06.665
And because I've met so
many compassionate humans,

00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:09.668
I realize it's foolish
to leave nothing but hatred

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:12.137
as legacy when I die.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.340
But even though my mind
understands that,

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:19.444
there is a devil in my
heart that cannot forgive--

00:21:19.478 --> 00:21:22.848
that fills me with rage.

00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:25.417
My very flesh rejects them.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.719
It rejects their blood!

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:32.057
[TIGER] Despite all
that I've fought for,

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.326
I cannot love them.

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:35.794
I'm sorry!

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:41.133
However you feel, you can work
it out when this is all done.

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:44.536
For now, I'm begging
you, just live!

00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:46.805
Listen, Boss. You're a hero.

00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:50.509
Those slaves that you set free,
they owe you their very lives.

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:53.745
Please, Boss, you can't
die, not like this!

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:56.081
To every slave
and every Fishman,

00:21:56.114 --> 00:21:58.817
you're a symbol of hope!

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.586
Then I'm happy.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.288
[TIGER]
You're still not strong enough.

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:04.523
Damn it!

00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:07.626
You have to step in front of
your men with your whole body.

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:09.594
Do that, you protect them.

00:22:09.628 --> 00:22:11.296
Huh? Why would I--

[TIGER] If there's no one
else who can challenge me,

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:19.971
I'm the new leader of
the Fishman District!

Call me, Tiger!

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:24.276
We're all brothers now.

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:26.611
Your blood is my blood,

00:22:26.645 --> 00:22:30.115
so I swear that I'll protect it!

00:22:30.148 --> 00:22:33.285
I'll fight for the lives
of every Fishman!

[SUN PIRATES crying]

00:23:01.313 --> 00:23:06.485
[SUN PIRATES]
No!

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:16.661
[NARRATOR] Fisher Tiger's death
comes as a great shock to all.

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:19.731
In the aftermath of his demise,
Fishmen are left wondering

00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:22.300
if they can truly
coexist with humans.

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:25.904
While Jimbei vows to uphold
Tiger and Otohime's ideals,

00:23:25.937 --> 00:23:28.106
Arlong's resentment grows.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.508
It's only a matter
of time before

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:32.310
the Sun Pirates face
a crisis of identity.

00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:33.912
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:37.382
"The Sun Pirates Split!
Jimbei vs. Arlong!"

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:39.885
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
