1
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,623
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,360
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,928
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,930
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,465
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,268
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,937
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,873
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:55,742
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,378
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,912
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:02,349
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,719
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,989
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:12,159
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:16,830
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,736
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of the his crew,

18
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,239
Luffy struggled in vain to
rescue his brother Ace

19
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,875
from execution at the
hands of the Navy.

20
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:31,011
Marineford was then thrown
into chaos by Blackbeard,

21
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,347
who stole Whitebeard's
Devil Fruit power.

22
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,848
While attempting
to flee the scene,

23
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,951
Luffy and Jimbei were
critically injured by Akainu,

24
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:42,088
who continues after them on
a path of merciless destruction.

25
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,892
A splendid speech.

26
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,194
Touched my heart.

27
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,729
And though they were few,

28
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,430
those precious
moments of courage

29
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,266
you showed will
change this world.

30
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,668
Though only the
future will tell if

31
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,604
it's for the better
or for the worse.

32
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,416
[SHANKS] It's been
a long time, old friend.

33
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,021
Let's end this war.

34
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,574
Shanks, huh?

35
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,612
The bastard who turned my
grandson into a damned pirate.

36
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,728
[cackles]

37
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,696
Lookee here.

38
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,436
[gasps]

39
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:11,111
[MARINE G] The whole
Red Hair Crew showed up!

40
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,417
[MEDIC A]
Prepare for surgery!

41
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,720
This is serious, they're
losing a lot of blood!

42
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,157
Set up for a transfusion!

43
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,392
[BEPO]
Captain! Hurry up!

44
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:28,862
I know this is cool to watch and
all, but we're going underwater!

45
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,037
But how?

46
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,405
His crew had a run in with one

47
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,574
of the other Emperors
just yesterday.

48
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,677
I thought he and Kaido would
still be duking it out for sure!

49
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:46,881
So... what's he doing all
the way over here?

50
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:51,285
Wha...? Shanks? No way!

51
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,120
--Huh?
--[BUGGY] I got enough goin' on,

52
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,955
I don't need you here!

53
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,158
[SHANKS]
Buggy, catch!

54
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,094
Eh? Your hat?

55
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,795
[SHANKS]
Give it back to Luffy for me.

56
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:04,198
Huh? Why don't you do it?

57
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,265
Listen!

58
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,201
I've drawn enough
attention to myself today.

59
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,369
It's time to get out!

60
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:11,605
No more favors,
especially not for you!

61
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,106
That's a real shame.

62
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,875
I was hoping you'd stick around.

63
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,310
I've been holding onto this
treasure map for a while,

64
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,879
hoping I'd bump into you.

65
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,714
[gasps] "Treasure map"?

66
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,950
And I guarantee
it'll suit your fancy.

67
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:23,984
Oh, really?

68
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,253
I'm supposed to believe
we're such good pals

69
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:29,723
that you'll give me
a treasure map over a dumb hat?

70
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,559
[SHANKS] Oh, well. I can always
give it to someone else.

71
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,661
[BUGGY grunts]
Don't be so hasty!

72
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,297
I'll do it for old time's sake!

73
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,233
[ROUX]
You sure about this?

74
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,835
Huh?

75
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,305
[ROUX] You haven't seen
Luffy in ten whole years.

76
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:47,274
You gonna let him leave
without saying hi?

77
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,917
It's been that long, huh?

78
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,691
[PATRONS laughing]

79
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,059
[PIRATE Q]
Talk about a loser!

80
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,464
[SHANKS laughing]

81
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,532
Why are you all laughing?

82
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,900
What's so funny?

83
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,303
You should have
fought back, Shanks!

84
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:18,105
It doesn't matter
how strong they look

85
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,539
or how many of them there are,

86
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:23,877
if you just laugh it off,
you're not a man or a pirate!

87
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,782
[LUFFY screams]

88
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,922
[LUFFY crying]

89
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,359
You can't cry, you're a man now.

90
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,461
But, Shanks, your arm...

91
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:44,531
Your arm!

92
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:49,169
Luffy, It's just an arm.
I've got another one.

93
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,371
I'm just glad you're all right.

94
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:56,409
[LUFFY crying]

95
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:05,453
I wonder. What would he say?

96
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,988
[BEPO] Captain! We have
to close the door!

97
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:11,725
If we wait, they'll open fire,
but if we don't, you'll drown!

98
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,728
Please stop making things
difficult on us and get inside!

99
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,762
Yeah, okay...

100
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:19,266
[BUGGY yelling]

101
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,767
Actually, wait.

102
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,803
No! We're gonna die!

103
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,307
[BUGGY grunting]

104
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,041
Here, Straw Hat forgot this!

105
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,577
Now, take it and go!

106
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,646
What is he throwing at us?

107
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,114
[BEPO]
Huh?

108
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,048
[LAW]
Huh?

109
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,118
I see.

110
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:41,221
Okay, okay, ya got the hat or
whatever, now c'mon, hurry up!

111
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,756
[LAW]
Right.

112
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,668
[BEPO panting]

113
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,907
It's still too soon, I'm afraid.

114
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,412
[SHANKS]
I'll leave this hat to you.

115
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:08,782
I want you to bring this
hat back to me someday,

116
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,485
in good condition,

117
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,387
and only once you've
become a great pirate.

118
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,257
That's our promise, Luffy.

119
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:34,808
I'll keep my word...

120
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,446
...and that means
I can't see you yet,

121
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,014
right, Luffy?

122
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:53,260
All right, shall we begin?

123
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,162
This one's been shot
through the stomach.

124
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:57,364
Amazing he's still alive.

125
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:00,167
Straw Hat's injuries
are fairly severe as well,

126
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,004
but I think his emotional
trauma is the real issue.

127
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:04,771
Do they need anesthesia?

128
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,141
Not in this state, no.
They're both unconscious

129
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:10,077
and Straw Hat is one
step shy of comatose.

130
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,479
In other words, no matter
how grisly this gets,

131
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:15,215
we won't hear
a peep out of them.

132
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,951
It's gonna be a fun
operation, yeah?

133
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:23,023
Damn it. Stop them!
Do whatever it takes!

134
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:31,298
Ice Age!

00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,405
Ah! They're after the submarine!

00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,373
The whole sea's freezing over!

137
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,116
Looking good.
His pulse is steady.

00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,020

[JEAN BART]
I dunno what happened,

141
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,324
but the water around
us is turning to ice!

[yells] It's gotta be Aokiji!

143
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,096
If we don't do something soon,

144
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,932
they're gonna grab us and
we'll be as good as dead!

145
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,233
Then do something!

146
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,534
[BEPO gasps]

147
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,337
We're diving deeper! Full speed!

Now, Yasakani Sacred Jewel!

00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:58,184
[gasps] What is it now?

156
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:03,156
Going deeper. Hold on tight!

[MEDICS gasping]

158
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:08,429
We got lucky once, but we're
dead for sure this time!

We'll be fine!

No!

00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:30,651
Jeez! Can't they just
give it up already?

163
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,586
Wait, he didn't
hit them, did he?

164
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,355
They can't die down there!

165
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:35,822
No way!

166
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,558
Aww, jeez.

167
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:42,095
If they're still
alive after that...

...I'm afraid Lady Luck
just isn't on our side.

169
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:50,136
But if we can't sink them today,
we'll sink them tomorrow.

00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,947
[MARINE H]
Hey, that's one of our ships.

172
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,416
Why's it taking off on its own?

173
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,385
Hurry up, dammit!

174
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:06,454
Follow that submarine!

175
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,855
Okay, but I mean,
it's already underwater.

00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,791
Also, I'm pretty sure
everyone on it is dead

after those attacks
from the admirals. Sorry.

178
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,663
[HANCOCK] They're alive.
I'm certain of it.

179
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,368
[HANCOCK]
Hear my words!

180
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,870
With my authority as
a Warlord of the Sea,

181
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:28,442
I shall pursue and capture Straw
Hat Luffy, no matter the cost!

182
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:30,578
[MARINES]
Yes, ma'am!

183
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:33,080
[MARINE I]
That's great, but, like, how?

184
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:35,015
Just shut up and go!

185
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:39,319
[MARINES gasp] It's so hot
when she yells at us!

186
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:19,827
[BUGGY] You scum-sucking,
red-haired sack of excrement!

187
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,097
You're telling me the
treasure map thing was a lie?

188
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,666
[BUGGY yells]

189
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,036
Just having some
fun, old friend.

190
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,438
It's been a while, huh?

191
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:33,240
Screw you!

192
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,510
"Oh, been a while, huh?" Blah!

193
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,144
What, did you think
that I'd forgive you

194
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,113
for what you did
out of kindness?

195
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,915
That I'd forget?

196
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,284
Forget about what?

197
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:45,953
Oh, don't give me that!

198
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,821
If you hadn't snuck up
on me back then,

199
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,956
I never would've
eaten that Devil Fruit,

200
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,193
and more importantly, I never
would've lost that treasure map.

201
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,395
In other words,

202
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:57,230
I'd be filthy rich instead
of running from the Navy!

203
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,401
Oh, is that so?

204
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,936
[BUGGY yells]

205
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,606
Playing it cool.
I should've known.

206
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,641
All these years and
you're still a prodigy

207
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,244
when it comes to pissing me off!

208
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,878
You've hardly been
here five minutes

209
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,247
and you've already
lied and cheated me!

210
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,350
You said you were
gonna stop the war?

211
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:20,254
Well, you're about to start
a new one, with me, right now!

212
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,522
Once a chump, always a chump!

213
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,358
You see that?

214
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,793
Sure did!

215
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:29,763
Even the Emperors can't
escape his trash talk!

216
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,865
He's such a pro!

217
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:38,772
[PRISONERS] Captain Buggy!
Could you be more perfect?

218
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,808
We'll follow you to
the ends of the world!

219
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,513
I really did miss you, though.

220
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:48,749
Oh, I'm sure you did!

221
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:50,250
Huh?

222
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:53,820
[BUGGY] But wait, these
guys are certified badasses.

223
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:55,990
If I can catch a ride
with my old crewmate,

224
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:58,925
I can get off this
island scot free.

225
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:12,706
[MARCO]
What now?

226
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,042
Marco,

227
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,445
there's nothing to gain
from fighting anymore.

228
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,815
Just walk away, nice and easy.

229
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:22,716
[grunts]

230
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:28,154
Hawk-Eye! Get back here!

231
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,527
I agreed to fight Whitebeard
and his allies, true,

232
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,230
but Red Hair is another
matter entirely.

233
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:37,664
[MARINES gasp]

234
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,934
[MIHAWK]
You should quit, as well.

235
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:57,551
[PIRATES gasping]

236
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:06,093
Your thirst for battle
is your undoing.

237
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:08,996
Every blow you land
upon your enemies,

238
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,665
you land upon your own men.

239
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:17,938
However, if anyone here
still hungers for battle...

240
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:23,009
...fine! Then come!

241
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:27,681
We shall be more than
happy to face you.

242
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:42,128
[MARINES gasping]

243
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:48,568
Well, Teach, you wanna try?

244
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:51,138
Sorry, "Blackbeard."

245
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:57,211
[laughs] Pretty as a picture,
aren't you, Red Hair?

246
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,446
Those scars are a nice touch.

247
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:22,569
[cackling]

248
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:26,473
[BLACKBEARD]
Y'know what? Fine.

249
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:33,079
[BLACKBEARD] I got what
I came for here, after all,

250
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,349
and I'm not looking for
a fight with you guys.

251
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:38,018
Well, not yet at least.

252
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,254
C'mon fellas, let's pack it up.

253
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:45,458
[BLACKBEARD cackling]

254
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:24,798
[SHANKS]
Accept your losses...

255
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,969
[SHANKS]
Honor the fallen...

256
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:34,374
Withdraw from battle
with your dignity intact.

257
00:20:57,891 --> 00:21:02,529
I think it's finally over now.

258
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:05,599
[SHANKS]
As for Whitebeard and Ace,

259
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,434
I'm sure you won't
object to their friends

260
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:09,236
taking care of the burial.

261
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:16,209
[SHANKS] The battle was already
broadcast to the entire world.

262
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:17,177
I won't allow you to make

263
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:18,812
a further spectacle
of their deaths

264
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:22,116
by parading their corpses
around like trophies.

265
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:23,517
And why shouldn't we?

266
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,886
If they wanted a proper
burial so badly,

267
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,422
then perhaps they shouldn't
have defied the Navy!

268
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,524
We have every right
to string the bastards up!

269
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:32,793
And why should we listen
to a pirate anyway?

270
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,229
[MARINE J]
It's our victory! We earned it!

271
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:36,597
That's enough!

272
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,498
[BOTH gasp]

273
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:40,000
But, sir!

274
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:47,308
I'll allow it, Shanks,
just this once.

275
00:21:47,341 --> 00:21:49,243
But why?

276
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:51,712
Let me take responsibility.

277
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:52,979
[DOBERMAN gasps]

278
00:21:54,782 --> 00:21:56,283
Thank you.

279
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,752
Now go treat the injured,
before it's too late!

280
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:02,422
[MARINES gasping]

281
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:08,162
[SENGOKU]
This war is over!

282
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:11,231
The Navy has won!

283
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:16,403
[MARINES cheering]

284
00:22:18,105 --> 00:22:20,407
If you can help
the medics, hop to it!

285
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:23,443
Get those with serious
injuries out of here first!

286
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:25,312
We've seen enough
suffering for today

287
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,714
and I won't lose any more men!

288
00:22:28,982 --> 00:22:30,818
[NARRATOR] And thus,
what would later be known

289
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:34,288
as "The War of the Best,"
ended in Marineford.

290
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:36,056
The most fearsome battle since

291
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,225
the beginning of the
Great Pirate Era,

292
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:40,828
brought victories
and defeats alike,

293
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:45,332
leaving the world
uncertain of its future.

294
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:14,962
[NARRATOR]
The War of the Best

295
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:17,664
has thrown the entire
world into chaos.

296
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,034
Emboldened by the final
words of Whitebeard,

297
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,902
the pirates once
again envision a wave

298
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:23,970
they can ride into a new era.

299
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:26,741
However, in the vacuum
left after his demise,

300
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:29,309
the seas grow rougher
than ever before.

301
00:23:29,343 --> 00:23:31,378
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

302
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:34,915
"Mighty Leaders Face Each Other
Down! Heralding the 'New Era'!"

303
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,918
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
