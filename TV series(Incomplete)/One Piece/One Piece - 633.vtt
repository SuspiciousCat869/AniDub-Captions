00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.330
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:42.905
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:38.016
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.922
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:46.132
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.638
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:51.911
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:53.748
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:56.152
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:59.191
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:03.501
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.136
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.877
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:13.152
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:18.163
[NARRATOR] Luffy forms an
alliance with Trafalgar Law

00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:20.502
in order to take down
one of the Four Emperors,

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:23.507
the rulers of the New World.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.310
Their first stop is Dressrosa,

00:03:25.343 --> 00:03:29.318
where they aim to destroy a
Devil Fruit manufacturing plant.

00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:30.988
Hoping to create a distraction,

00:03:31.022 --> 00:03:34.228
they arrange a trade with
the country's king, Doflamingo.

00:03:34.262 --> 00:03:36.098
But after Zoro's
sword is stolen,

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:39.539
the crew becomes hopelessly
separated in the vast city.

00:03:39.572 --> 00:03:43.714
I need your help.
Hold me in a romantic embrace!

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.439
I might fall in love with you.

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:59.077
[SANJI gasps]

00:04:02.217 --> 00:04:04.990
[VIOLET] I should've told you,
my name is Violet.

00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:07.361
Would you mind,
if it's not too much,

00:04:07.394 --> 00:04:08.831
escorting me to the next town?

00:04:08.865 --> 00:04:10.167
[SANJI]
Anything.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.638
And once we arrive...

00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:18.550
[VIOLET] ...there is a man there
I need you to kill for me.

00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:19.953
Huh?

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.561
[MAN B]
So whoever wins the tournament,

00:04:23.594 --> 00:04:24.830
they get a Devil Fruit?

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:26.199
[MAN C]
And an awesome one!

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:29.973
The Flame Flame Fruit that
belonged to Fire Fist Ace!

00:04:30.006 --> 00:04:32.812
Hey! Over here! I wanna enter!

00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:35.383
I'm gonna enter! Me!

00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:38.090
[TOY SOLDIER]
What?

00:04:38.123 --> 00:04:38.858
What?!

00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:40.728
No, you can't, you're too old!

00:04:40.761 --> 00:04:42.765
Please, sir!

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:45.738
[chuckles]

00:04:56.893 --> 00:05:00.266
[LUFFY chuckling]

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:03.106
You lost, grandpa?

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.811
This booth is where you
register for the competition.

00:05:05.845 --> 00:05:08.282
Exactly. Put my name down!

00:05:08.316 --> 00:05:10.788
That geezer must be
out of his mind or something!

00:05:10.821 --> 00:05:12.157
No way he's sane!

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.829
Does he even know who he's
gonna be battling against?

00:05:14.863 --> 00:05:16.834
[MAN A] Not a chance!
From what I've heard,

00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:18.904
they've got some heavy-hitters
from the New World

00:05:18.937 --> 00:05:20.541
who are dying to get that fruit.

00:05:20.575 --> 00:05:23.313
Not to mention the champions
from the Don Quixote family.

00:05:23.346 --> 00:05:25.484
They'll stomp that
old-timer like a bug.

00:05:25.518 --> 00:05:27.053
Listen up, Luffy.

00:05:27.087 --> 00:05:29.291
You gotta promise me
just one thing.

00:05:29.324 --> 00:05:32.497
Fight however you want, but
don't let 'em know who you are.

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.068
I'm undercover!

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:35.103
[ATTENDANT EOS A]
Sign your name.

00:05:35.137 --> 00:05:36.239
[LUFFY]
Luf--

00:05:36.272 --> 00:05:38.009
[FRANKY]
What'd I just say!

00:05:50.902 --> 00:05:54.909
Sorry, sir. Only fighters
are allowed here.

00:05:54.943 --> 00:05:56.211
Follow me.

00:05:58.049 --> 00:06:00.588
You remember what I
told you earlier.

00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:03.827
Beat the crap out of 'em,
but keep a low profile.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.531
I'll use my undercover voice.

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:06.734
Next time I see you,

00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:09.539
I'll be holding the Flame Flame
Fruit, piece of cake!

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:15.416
[LUFFY]
Ooh.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.995
Huh?

00:06:27.842 --> 00:06:29.612
As I feared.

00:06:29.646 --> 00:06:32.551
She's in the competition.
My Rebecca!

00:06:56.733 --> 00:06:57.802
[FRANKY]
Yo.

00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:02.679
Huh? Are you talking to me?

00:07:02.712 --> 00:07:03.780
[FRANKY]
Mister soldier.

00:07:03.814 --> 00:07:05.551
You from this
country originally?

00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:07.588
Huh? Well, of course I am!

00:07:07.621 --> 00:07:08.891
Born and raised!

00:07:08.924 --> 00:07:10.894
Come on, don't you know a pure
Dressrosan when you see one?

00:07:10.928 --> 00:07:12.565
I do now.

00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:20.413
Maybe you can help me out.

00:07:20.447 --> 00:07:22.852
I heard the big guns of
the Don Quixote family

00:07:22.885 --> 00:07:25.023
are showin' today. Is that true?

00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:27.427
[TOY SOLDIER]
Don Quixote?

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.164
How do you turn
your volume down?

00:07:29.197 --> 00:07:31.903
Just answer the question!
Are they here or not?

00:07:31.937 --> 00:07:34.475
What's your interest in
the Don Quixote family?

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:36.713
I'm afraid I can't
tell you that.

00:07:36.746 --> 00:07:37.782
If you don't know,

00:07:37.816 --> 00:07:39.886
can you tell me anything
about the SMILE factory?

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:42.692
You want to know
about the factory?

00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:45.698
For a small fry,
you sure do yell a lot!

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.584
[SANJI gasps]

00:07:55.618 --> 00:07:57.087
I can't thank you enough!

00:07:57.121 --> 00:07:57.756
Huh?

00:07:57.789 --> 00:07:59.526
You're a wonderful chef!

00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:02.765
That dish you made me,
it was so very delicious!

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:07.474
[gasps] It all makes sense now.

00:08:07.508 --> 00:08:10.446
The reason I've been improving
my cooking skills all this time

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.051
was for this moment.

00:08:12.084 --> 00:08:15.223
So I could one day
cook for you, Violet.

00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:16.793
[gasps]

00:08:17.762 --> 00:08:19.231
Sanji...

00:08:21.035 --> 00:08:21.904
Thank you!

00:08:21.937 --> 00:08:24.341
[gasps]

00:08:27.515 --> 00:08:29.652
Here they come again.

00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:30.320
This way!

00:08:30.353 --> 00:08:31.689
[SANJI gasps]

00:08:35.698 --> 00:08:37.468
[SANJI]
Wherever you want, my sweet!

00:08:37.502 --> 00:08:40.440
I'll follow you to
the ends of the earth!

00:08:43.714 --> 00:08:45.584
[SANJI]
Is this reality?

00:08:45.617 --> 00:08:48.924
The two of us are literally
a pair of runaway lovers!

00:08:48.957 --> 00:08:51.930
The more the authorities pursue
us and try to tear us apart,

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:54.569
the more inseparable
our bond becomes!

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:56.707
And when the world
turns its back on us,

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.446
the brighter the flame
of our love burns!

00:09:01.983 --> 00:09:06.492
[SANJI] I wish this happiness
would last forever and ever!

00:09:08.698 --> 00:09:10.233
They'll spot us if we run.

00:09:10.267 --> 00:09:11.970
Best to walk simply away.

00:09:12.003 --> 00:09:14.509
Walk away! Huh?

00:09:17.982 --> 00:09:22.323
[SANJI] Well, Sanji,
the dream had to end sometime.

00:09:35.317 --> 00:09:37.521
Uh-- What?

00:09:38.924 --> 00:09:42.531
[SANJI] But I thought you
said we should walk away!

00:09:43.533 --> 00:09:44.736
Together, yes.

00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:49.444
[SANJI gasps]

00:09:54.822 --> 00:09:57.460
[LUFFY]
Ooh.

00:10:06.479 --> 00:10:08.784
[ATTENDANT EOS A] This is the
waiting room for competitors.

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:10.554
Stay here until we call you.

00:10:10.587 --> 00:10:13.292
Talk about action central! Wow!

00:10:14.462 --> 00:10:16.800
[grunting]

00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:19.038
The Flame Flame Fruit
is as good as mine!

00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:20.808
Think again, you blockhead!

00:10:20.842 --> 00:10:22.377
[COMPETITORS growl]

00:10:25.049 --> 00:10:27.287
[COMPETITOR E] You're standing
in the way, ya weakling!

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.458
Says who? Huh?

00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:31.428
[gasps]

00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:40.781
Ooh.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.028
Huh?

00:10:53.907 --> 00:10:57.013
See that? What's with
the little guy?

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:07.100
Interesting.

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:11.141
Looks like we can use
any weapon we want.

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:14.749
[COMPETITORS giggle]

00:11:14.782 --> 00:11:17.021
Huh? What gives?

00:11:17.054 --> 00:11:19.090
Is this some kinda joke?

00:11:20.293 --> 00:11:22.464
[COMPETITOR M] I guess
he's the final entrant.

00:11:22.497 --> 00:11:24.736
Against warriors
like us? Get serious!

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:27.307
[COMPETITOR N laughs]

00:11:30.413 --> 00:11:31.917
This is more than a joke!

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.056
It's an insult to
every gladiator here!

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.098
What're you tryin'
to pull, squirt?

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:57.902
Think that fake beard
makes you look tough?

00:11:57.935 --> 00:11:59.706
[COMPETITOR P]
Forget about him, Spartan!

00:11:59.739 --> 00:12:01.242
Who the hell wants
to see the weak

00:12:01.275 --> 00:12:03.580
get crushed to a bloody pulp?

00:12:03.613 --> 00:12:05.083
The crowd thirsts for battles

00:12:05.116 --> 00:12:07.521
between strong and
manly warriors!

00:12:07.554 --> 00:12:11.697
This is no place for the
likes of you! So piss off!

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.067
Here, let me help ya!

00:12:18.743 --> 00:12:20.948
[SPARTAN yells]

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.570
[SPARTAN gasps]

00:12:31.603 --> 00:12:33.172
[COMPETITORS gasp]

00:13:57.407 --> 00:14:00.881
[giggles] My kinda place!

00:14:18.416 --> 00:14:21.455
[COMPETITOR T] Woah! You see
what that shrimp did to him?

00:14:21.488 --> 00:14:23.927
[COMPETITOR U] He just took down
Spartan like it was nothing!

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.264
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:27.500
[COMPETITOR V]
That's insane!

00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:30.507
He was one of the star
contenders of the Colosseum!

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.444
[COMPETITOR W] I dunno!
Maybe the clutz just

00:14:32.477 --> 00:14:33.713
tripped over himself!

00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:35.684
[COMPETITOR X] That wouldn't
lodge you in the ground!

00:14:35.717 --> 00:14:38.656
So? Where to?

00:14:39.626 --> 00:14:41.596
Did you start a fight
before the event?

00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:42.632
[LUFFY gasps]

00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:44.367
I'm afraid that you're
gonna have to leave.

00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:45.538
You're disqualified!

00:14:45.571 --> 00:14:46.272
What?

00:14:46.305 --> 00:14:47.774
We don't need trash like you

00:14:47.808 --> 00:14:49.846
causing brawls
before the matches!

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:51.248
[gasps]

00:14:51.281 --> 00:14:52.618
[gasps]

00:14:52.651 --> 00:14:55.857
[SAI] Come on.
Knock it off, you idiot.

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:02.370
The big guy started a fight
he couldn't handle.

00:15:02.404 --> 00:15:04.407
He's the one
you should disqualify!

00:15:04.441 --> 00:15:06.178
If he weren't unconscious.

00:15:06.212 --> 00:15:08.917
I don't believe it!
That's Sai and Boo from Kano!

00:15:08.951 --> 00:15:11.255
And that's Don Chin Jao
behind them!

00:15:11.288 --> 00:15:13.593
That guy's a living legend!

00:15:26.419 --> 00:15:27.721
And you're certain?

00:15:27.755 --> 00:15:31.161
[COMPETITOR BB chuckles] You can
trust me. Spartan started it.

00:15:31.194 --> 00:15:34.903
In that case,
Spartan is now disqualified!

00:15:34.936 --> 00:15:37.006
And Lucy can still compete.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.208
[LUFFY]
Great!

00:15:40.748 --> 00:15:42.818
Thank you, guys. I owe ya!

00:15:42.852 --> 00:15:45.423
Hey, don't mention it,
pip squeak! [chuckles]

00:15:45.456 --> 00:15:48.630
Yeah. That's right.
Don't mention it at all.

00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:50.934
In fact, it kinda pisses me off

00:15:50.968 --> 00:15:53.573
when I hear anyone say
the words "thank you."

00:15:53.606 --> 00:15:54.676
Take it back!

00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:57.147
Take back your gratitude,
ya grateful bastard!

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.417
[BOO] You don't have to
reject it that hard, bro!

00:15:59.451 --> 00:16:02.290
If you ever say those words
to me again, I'll kill you!

00:16:02.323 --> 00:16:05.130
[BOO] Sorry. Sometimes he
gets a little worked up.

00:16:05.163 --> 00:16:07.434
I guess that there's
all types out there.

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:10.139
Dagama! You ought'a
know it's pointless

00:16:10.173 --> 00:16:12.845
making alliances with the
other big shots in your block!

00:16:12.879 --> 00:16:16.385
Now that is a baseless
accusation, Kelly Funk.

00:16:16.418 --> 00:16:17.855
Enough trash talk.

00:16:17.888 --> 00:16:19.859
Lot of big names showing up.

00:16:19.892 --> 00:16:21.161
You said it.

00:16:21.194 --> 00:16:24.001
Looks like each country chose
to send their baddest dudes!

00:16:24.034 --> 00:16:26.672
[COMPETITOR DD] I was hoping
for a fight between gladiators,

00:16:26.706 --> 00:16:29.679
but this is turning into a war
between nations over here!

00:16:29.712 --> 00:16:32.417
First, conspiracy,
and now bribery?

00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:34.521
You make me sick, Dagama!

00:16:34.555 --> 00:16:37.093
There's no point
allying with anyone!

00:16:37.126 --> 00:16:38.462
Even if you cheat like that,

00:16:38.495 --> 00:16:40.299
there's only one
winner per block!

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.403
That means someone's
gotta go down!

00:16:42.437 --> 00:16:44.474
How about we cut the crap?

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:47.915
You're here on your
country's orders, same as me!

00:16:47.948 --> 00:16:50.554
The Flame Flame Fruit
gives you more than power,

00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:52.256
it gives you prestige!

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:56.933
Most importantly, it gives you
a tactical military advantage!

00:16:56.967 --> 00:16:59.506
Take a look around at
the faces in this room!

00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:01.843
Let me tell you what I see!

00:17:01.876 --> 00:17:03.713
Suleiman the beheader!

00:17:03.747 --> 00:17:07.287
Class A war criminal involved
in the Sea Battle of Dias.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.959
Abdullah and Jeet,
former bounty hunters

00:17:09.992 --> 00:17:13.633
now wanted for their savage
attacks of government buildings.

00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:16.172
Don't forget about
Orlumbus "The Surmounter."

00:17:16.205 --> 00:17:18.076
The Adventurer of lies!

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.915
Sponsored by the
Don Quixote family itself,

00:17:20.948 --> 00:17:23.553
we have the sadistic
100 million pirate.

00:17:23.586 --> 00:17:25.691
Bellamy the Hyena!

00:17:25.724 --> 00:17:29.397
I also heard the "Pirate Noble"
Cavendish is gonna be here.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.469
And the mad rookie Bartolomeo

00:17:31.503 --> 00:17:34.642
who made waves in
the New World last year.

00:17:34.676 --> 00:17:35.977
Be honest.

00:17:36.011 --> 00:17:38.817
You think with this room
of notorious characters,

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.388
no one is plotting
to rig the match?

00:17:41.421 --> 00:17:43.894
It'd be insane if
we didn't have a plan!

00:17:43.927 --> 00:17:46.398
I'm sure you two are
up to something as well.

00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:47.500
Am I wrong?

00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:49.839
[LUFFY] Is there gonna
be any food served?

00:17:49.872 --> 00:17:50.874
You kiddin'?

00:17:50.907 --> 00:17:53.445
The first challenge
here is a free-for-all!

00:17:53.478 --> 00:17:56.351
Only one winner per block
goes to the next round!

00:17:56.384 --> 00:17:58.723
[COMPETITORS]
Yeah!

00:17:58.756 --> 00:18:00.928
Block A's match
is about to start!

00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:04.033
Then B, C, and D
will get their turns!

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:07.541
There's a grand total
of 550 competitors here!

00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:11.882
As for the following round,
only four will move on!

00:18:11.916 --> 00:18:13.954
The odds of winning
are pretty slim.

00:18:13.987 --> 00:18:15.724
But having your brother
in the same block

00:18:15.757 --> 00:18:18.730
should certainly help!
How fortunate!

00:18:18.763 --> 00:18:20.433
Guess that's
merely a coincidence

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:23.405
and not because you paid
an official to arrange it.

00:18:23.439 --> 00:18:25.944
Just lucky I guess.

00:18:25.977 --> 00:18:28.148
Yep, just luck.

00:18:28.181 --> 00:18:30.252
[LUFFY]
Which Block do I fight in?

00:18:30.286 --> 00:18:33.359
The receptionist should
have told you already.

00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:35.764
It says here that
you're in Block C.

00:18:35.798 --> 00:18:38.736
I'm sure everyone here's got
a different reason to fight.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.810
And depending on whoever
gets the Flame Flame Fruit,

00:18:41.843 --> 00:18:44.314
the whole world
could fall into chaos.

00:18:44.347 --> 00:18:46.051
But that's the way it goes!

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:48.523
Good luck and may
the best man win!

00:18:48.557 --> 00:18:51.763
[cackles]

00:18:51.796 --> 00:18:55.971
[CROWD cheers]

00:18:56.004 --> 00:18:59.044
All right! I can tell
you're excited!

00:18:59.077 --> 00:19:00.446
Before the bloodshed,

00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:03.152
here are the rules for
today's competition!

00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:09.163
[CROWD cheers]

00:19:09.197 --> 00:19:11.670
[GYATS] For the first round,
competitors will be divided

00:19:11.703 --> 00:19:14.875
into four blocks and
engage in a battle royale!

00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:16.345
For those who don't know,

00:19:16.378 --> 00:19:19.652
a battle royale is where
everyone fights simultaneously.

00:19:19.686 --> 00:19:22.691
Meaning everyone's the
enemy except yourself!

00:19:22.725 --> 00:19:24.828
The match ends only when
everyone else has been

00:19:24.862 --> 00:19:26.799
eliminated or killed
in the arena!

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:30.006
The last gladiator standing
will be declared the winner!

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:32.176
A competitor is out of
the game if they get

00:19:32.209 --> 00:19:36.118
thrown out of the ring or
are cut down by an opponent!

00:19:36.151 --> 00:19:38.790
Meanwhile, in the moat
circling the stage,

00:19:38.823 --> 00:19:40.459
we have a unique attraction.

00:19:40.492 --> 00:19:42.330
A school of Little Fighting Fish

00:19:42.364 --> 00:19:45.603
waiting to devour
anyone who falls in!

00:19:47.407 --> 00:19:49.477
[GYATS] Doesn't matter if
you're in or out of the ring!

00:19:49.512 --> 00:19:51.381
Corrida Colosseum is hell!

00:19:51.414 --> 00:19:54.020
So who's ready for some
pain and suffering?

00:19:54.053 --> 00:19:59.698
[CROWD cheers]

00:20:00.767 --> 00:20:02.069
[GYATS]
Then enough talk!

00:20:02.103 --> 00:20:05.978
Let's begin, the first round of
the Corrida Colosseum events!

00:20:06.011 --> 00:20:09.852
Attention to all 137
competitors from Block A!

00:20:09.885 --> 00:20:12.424
Ready? At the sound of the bell.

00:20:12.457 --> 00:20:14.394
Fight!

00:20:14.427 --> 00:20:15.764
[CROWD cheers]

00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:17.768
[COMPETITOR FF yells]

00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:21.642
[yells]

00:20:27.453 --> 00:20:33.699
[CROWD cheers]

00:20:39.477 --> 00:20:43.084
[LUFFY]
Whoa!

00:20:44.253 --> 00:20:48.997
[LUFFY]
Armor! Helmets and swords!

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.101
My head's about to explode!

00:20:51.135 --> 00:20:53.873
You mean we can use
whatever we want?

00:20:53.906 --> 00:20:56.378
Choose anything except
projectile weapons.

00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:58.783
[LUFFY]
Oh, ho, ho!

00:21:00.353 --> 00:21:04.193
[LUFFY] A half-naked statue
of an ancient warrior dude!

00:21:04.227 --> 00:21:05.697
Kick ass!

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.935
Can I have that?

00:21:07.968 --> 00:21:09.403
Afraid not.

00:21:12.209 --> 00:21:14.280
[ATTENDANTS gasp]

00:21:20.193 --> 00:21:21.997
I'm gonna wear this armor!

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.434
And a helmet cooler
than that old man's!

00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:26.371
Wait! Which do I want?

00:21:26.404 --> 00:21:29.143
I'm gonna pick the biggest
sword on the wall! Duh!

00:21:29.177 --> 00:21:34.120
[LUFFY giggles] This lion shield
is definitely coming with me!

00:21:35.289 --> 00:21:36.993
[LUFFY]
Ooh, and this, too!

00:21:37.026 --> 00:21:40.432
I wish Usopp and the others
could see me now!

00:21:44.508 --> 00:21:45.978
Hey! What's wrong?

00:21:46.011 --> 00:21:48.717
It's the nobleman.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:49.819
A nobleman?

00:21:49.852 --> 00:21:52.525
All the female staff
are wilting like daisies!

00:21:52.558 --> 00:21:54.260
What gives?

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.870
Just a peek is too much for me!

00:22:06.686 --> 00:22:09.324
Well I'll be damned.
That is Cavendish.

00:22:09.357 --> 00:22:12.531
You mean the Pirate Noble?
I can't believe he's alive!

00:22:12.564 --> 00:22:15.335
I can't believe
he's so beautiful!

00:22:19.076 --> 00:22:22.216
[CAVENDISH] This is where
we wait? How degrading.

00:22:23.687 --> 00:22:25.857
Ah! You over there.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:26.993
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:22:27.026 --> 00:22:28.529
Nice ensemble.

00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:30.934
[CAVENDISH]
Alas, there is a weight limit

00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:32.971
for gear, I'm afraid.

00:22:33.004 --> 00:22:36.913
A limit? Well that kinda sucks.

00:22:36.946 --> 00:22:39.518
I look so cool though.

00:22:39.551 --> 00:22:41.789
[CAVENDISH sighs]
Doesn't matter.

00:22:41.822 --> 00:22:45.095
All the weapons and armor
in the world won't help you.

00:22:45.997 --> 00:22:49.571
There's only one who deserves
the Flame Flame Fruit.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.155
Me!

00:22:58.189 --> 00:23:00.694
Such beautiful power
is wasted on you.

00:23:00.727 --> 00:23:03.799
It's only fit for someone
equally as stunning!

00:23:14.922 --> 00:23:16.491
[NARRATOR] The stunningly
handsome Cavendish,

00:23:16.526 --> 00:23:18.462
worth over a hundred
million Berries,

00:23:18.495 --> 00:23:19.798
reveals his frightening motive

00:23:19.832 --> 00:23:21.468
for seeking the
Flame Flame Fruit--

00:23:21.502 --> 00:23:22.971
declaring that
he'll slaughter Luffy

00:23:23.004 --> 00:23:24.875
and his fellow
rookies to get it.

00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:27.814
As a fresh sense of panic
sweeps through the Colosseum,

00:23:27.847 --> 00:23:31.087
Luffy meets a mysterious
and lovely female fencer.

00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:32.791
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.824 --> 00:23:35.229
"A Pirate Noble! Cavendish!"

00:23:35.262 --> 00:23:38.335
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
