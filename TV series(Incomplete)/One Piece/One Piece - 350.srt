1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,941
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:40,410
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,081
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:50,086
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,990
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:57,360
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,796
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:03,266
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,202
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,105
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,175
[NEGATIVE GHOST]
Horo horo horo horo!

48
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:20,783
[MORIA] Let's illuminate
our friend here!

49
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:22,819
[LUFFY] What are ya
gonna do, ya jerk?

50
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:25,788
I'm gonna make you pay!

51
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,976
What? What the hell?
My shadow?

52
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,984
No, don't do it!

53
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,233
Ishishi!

54
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:13,069
[MORIA] The shadow of a man
with a 300 million berry bounty!

55
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:14,370
And it's all mine!

56
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:16,005
Now, we'll create
the most powerful

57
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,875
special zombie the
world has ever seen!

58
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:22,278
Kushishishi!

59
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:27,083
[LUFFY] "The Warrior
Known as the 'Devil'!!

60
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:29,018
The Moment of Oars' Revival."

61
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:51,140
[MORIA]
Kushishishishi!

62
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:56,079
Kushishishishi!
Kushishishishi!

63
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:59,282
Now, Straw Hat becomes just
another one of my subjects.

64
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:00,316
And my ultimate minion

65
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,086
will have the power
he needs to come to life!

66
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:09,158
Kushishishishi!
Kushishishishi!

67
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,461
Kushishishishi!

68
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:14,063
Poor Luffy!

69
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:18,501
What just happened?
That's not possible, is it?

70
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,269
His shadow.

71
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:22,338
He cut it off and took it!

72
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,239
[USOPP] Wait a minute!

73
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,074
We've heard about
this, haven't we?

74
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,677
Didn't that skeleton say the
same thing happened to him?

75
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,644
[NAMI] Yeah! I remember!

76
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,279
He said his shadow was stolen!

77
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:32,949
Then this must be
the guy that did it!

78
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:34,584
I bet you're right. How awful.

79
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,351
[KUMACY] Uhhh...

80
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,419
What's the trick?

81
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,321
It must be a Devil Fruit power.

82
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:42,291
Kumacy! Am I imagining things,

83
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:44,694
or were you speaking again?

84
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,131
When I say don't talk,
you shut your mouth for good.

85
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,334
[PERONA] Listen, you!

86
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:53,636
Don't make me keep repeating
myself over and over again!

87
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:57,173
You're not the least bit cute
when you talk, so don't do it!

88
00:05:57,206 --> 00:06:00,009
[ABSALOM] She's very
strict with poor Kumacy.

89
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:01,978
Beary strict, even.

90
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,695
Is there something
you'd like to say?

91
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:25,234
'Cause if you want
to talk. Don't! Ever!

92
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,036
Kushishishishi!

93
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,005
This little guy is just
what I need to bring me

94
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,340
one step closer to becoming
King of the Pirates.

95
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:33,176
Right, Doctor Hogback?

96
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:35,244
Fasfasfasfas!

97
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,647
Since the time
I met you ten years ago,

98
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,649
I've put all of
my time, resources,

99
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:42,185
and energy into
making number 900!

100
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,219
With that shadow,

101
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:45,588
it will make the greatest
zombie of all time!

102
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,423
With that power
at your fingertips,

103
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,725
nothing will be
beyond your reach!

104
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:52,495
[ABSALOM] That means it will
only be a matter of time

105
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,998
before I become the Cemetery
King of the entire world!

106
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,235
[PERONA] And I'll transform
all the cute creatures

107
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:00,670
of the world into zombies.

108
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:02,605
Then I'll have an
entire adorable kingdom

109
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,607
full of servants
that never talk back!

110
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,508
That's right!

111
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,676
It doesn't matter
who the person is,

112
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:10,113
how powerful they are, or how
strong-willed they may be.

113
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,381
Once their shadow is taken
and placed in another,

114
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,683
they bow to your will.

115
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:16,285
Soon, I'll fill the
world with my servants!

116
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,454
If I'd had an army
like that before,

117
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,522
I wouldn't have been beaten by

118
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,525
that idiot Kaido
in the New World.

119
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,595
I think it's about time
we open his eyes, don't you?

120
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:27,363
Gyoro! Nin! Bao!

121
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,198
Yes, Master!
What's your command?

122
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:30,233
Go on ahead

123
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:32,235
and open the door to
the special refrigerator!

124
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:34,637
[ZOMBIE TRIO]
Right! As you wish, Master!

125
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,775
[MORIA]
It's almost time, sweet 900!

126
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:42,712
In but a few moments,
your eyes will open at last!

127
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,480
The perfect shadow
has finally found

128
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,716
its way to my doorstep.

129
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,384
And once I've
placed it inside you,

130
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,720
you'll help me become
King of the Pirates!

131
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,555
Kushishishishi!

132
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,123
Hey, Spider Mouse! Come here!

133
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:55,057
[SPIDER MOUSE 349E] Yes?

134
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,492
[ABSALOM]
Take Straw Hat Luffy's body

135
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,294
and throw it back on his ship.

136
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:00,163
Make sure to remove those webs.

137
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,265
We'll be in trouble if he dies.

138
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:03,232
You got it!

139
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:05,401
Wait! I have an urgent
report to give you!

140
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,235
What is it?

141
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,770
Just moments
ago, the Spider Monkey,

142
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:11,307
Captain Tararan,
was defeated by intruders!

143
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,311
Defeated? Heh!
What does that matter?

144
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:16,746
As long as his
shadow wasn't removed.

145
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,415
But that's just it!
His shadow was removed!

146
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,418
[ABSALOM]
You're certain of this?

147
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:23,519
Yes! There's no doubt!

148
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,188
Grrrrr!

149
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,289
It's him, Absalom!

150
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:29,759
Only one man is capable of
doing this! He has returned!

151
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,761
Damn that
Humming Swordsman!

152
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,497
It seems the reports
I received this morning

153
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,865
weren't so crazy after all.

154
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,333
How could this happen?!

155
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:38,334
The Humming Swordsman
is running around

156
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:40,870
removing every zombie's
shadow he comes across!

157
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,938
Out of nowhere,

158
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:43,839
the number of casualties
has gone through the roof!

159
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:45,508
Everything's playing
out just like

160
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,070
that terrible ordeal we
went through 5 years ago.

161
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,896
[FRANKY] What?
Return to the ship?

162
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,032
You want us to go back
on board the Sunny?

163
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:02,199
[BROOK] Yes, that's right.

164
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:05,002
If your comrades have been
captured, I fear the worst.

165
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:07,004
By now, and if not, very soon,

166
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,173
they will have surely
had their shadows stolen.

167
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,909
But even if that's
the case, they won't die.

168
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:14,845
Their bodies will likely
be taken back to your boat.

169
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,615
You see this?
They'll end up just like me!

170
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,285
Wait! The shadow part,
not the dead part!

171
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,187
Yeah, Yeah, I get it!
Let's move on!

172
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,523
Anyway. Like you were saying,

173
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:29,026
even if you have your shadow
taken, you won't die. Right?

174
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,929
Yes, that would be correct.
But whenever it's taken,

175
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:34,231
you immediately weaken
and lose consciousness.

176
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:36,634
Usually for about
two days or so.

177
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,803
If the victim is strong enough,
then they'll put the

178
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,973
bodies on a ship and send
them to drift out in the sea,

179
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,575
which is why I'm urging
you to return to yours.

180
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:46,143
Any guess as to
why they do this?

181
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,045
[ROBIN] Well, I would assume
it's to prevent the victims

182
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,715
from trying to take back
their shadows. Correct?

183
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,582
Yes!

184
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:52,650
[FRANKY] Why don't
they just kill them

185
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,652
while they're unconscious
and get it over with?

186
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,153
That's something
they cannot do.

187
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,221
Hmm?

188
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,556
[BROOK]
Now this is important,

189
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:01,892
so be sure to
pay close attention.

190
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,595
Firstly, even though the body

191
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:08,165
and shadow have been separated,
they still represent one being.

192
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,834
Think of the shadow as a soul.

193
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,770
If the body dies, the shadow
will disappear as well.

194
00:10:12,803 --> 00:10:15,306
Thusly, killing the
host zombie in the process.

195
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:17,341
Since they're trying to
build an army of minions,

196
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,910
this would certainly
not bode well for them.

197
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:22,346
Secondly, in the likely
event that your friends

198
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,981
have had their shadows stolen,

199
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:26,350
they would most definitely
still be alive and their bodies

200
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:30,254
would be returned to your
ship as soon as possible.

201
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,757
Which is why,

202
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,993
the two of you must not lose
your shadows, as well.

203
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:38,629
If you do, all hope will be
lost and you'll be forced

204
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:42,700
to wander these seas
aimlessly for all eternity.

205
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,769
[BROOK] While you have
this window of opportunity,

206
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:47,605
you should use it to attempt
to awaken your comrades.

207
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:49,273
Once you do, you must regroup

208
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:53,044
and formulate a plan
to reclaim their shadows.

209
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,311
Do you understand?

210
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:55,813
Does all of this make sense?

211
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:58,949
[FRANKY] Hmm...
Yeah, I think so.

212
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,019
Your shadow story
wasn't so crazy after all.

213
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,020
[BROOK] Both of you.
Take this.

214
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:04,355
Huh?

215
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:08,793
[ROBIN] What is it?

216
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,062
[BROOK] The weakness
of these zombies.

217
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:12,963
[BROOK] You've seen its power.

218
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:16,233
This was the weapon I used
to defeat that Spider Monkey.

219
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:25,810
What the hell is that thing?

220
00:11:25,843 --> 00:11:28,379
That thing would be
the soul of the zombie.

221
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:32,316
[FRANKY] Its soul? Why's it
coming out of his mouth?!

222
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,985
No! Captain!

223
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,987
[BROOK] Go on. Get out of here!

224
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,989
Return to your rightful owner!

225
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,875
Their weakness, huh?

226
00:11:57,908 --> 00:12:00,344
What is this stuff, anyway?

227
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,346
It's ordinary salt.

228
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:04,048
It's just salt?

229
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:06,851
Not exactly what I had in
mind as the vanquisher of evil.

230
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,052
Does it lift the
curse or something?

231
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:09,720
[BROOK] Well,
I suppose that would be

232
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:11,055
one way of putting it, yes.

233
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:12,857
The reanimated life
of these zombies

234
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,025
is brought about by
a Devil Fruit power.

235
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,395
And just as one who is a power
holder is weakened by seawater,

236
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:20,431
the salt that is contained
in that water can be

237
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:22,967
used as a weapon to unbind
the shadow from a zombie,

238
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,469
leaving them
permanently deceased.

239
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,071
Okay, I get it.

240
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:28,873
Then when this
Spider Monkey went down,

241
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,374
that black thing that
floated out of him afterward

242
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,244
was someone else's shadow
that he'd been given.

243
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:35,946
To think, something so simple
would be their weakness.

244
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,382
[BROOK] So, in summation,
in order to defeat the zombies,

245
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:40,417
simply throw salt
into their mouths.

246
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:42,887
That's the trick! Salt! Mouth!

247
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,822
Deader than dead!
Make no bones about it!

248
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,223
[ROBIN] Pardon me, Brook.

249
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,224
But how do you know

250
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,826
so much about this
island and its residents.

251
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,395
And how do know
the zombie's weakness?

252
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,330
[BROOK] It all relates
back to an incident

253
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,833
on this island 5 years ago.

254
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,068
The time when I lost my shadow.

255
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,838
I was sent out to sea,
just like all the others.

256
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,742
Luckily, I awoke and was able to
retrace my path and return here.

257
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,358
[BROOK] Once I did, I went
ashore and began my battle.

258
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:28,999
I fought against, the very
zombie that had my shadow.

259
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,372
[BROOK] Unfortunately, the
outcome was a crushing defeat.

260
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,378
[BROOK] Because I vowed to
survive, no matter what I faced.

261
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:46,383
I ran. Even if it was shameful,
I had to keep on living.

262
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,485
I have an
obligation, you see.

263
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:52,323
I was the only
survivor of my crew.

264
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:55,492
One day, I will
escape these evil seas,

265
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:57,461
and make good on the
promises made by myself

266
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,463
and my comrades.

267
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:03,801
Until then, I cannot
die a second time.

268
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:06,570
Sadly, living longer
hasn't helped me

269
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,807
to keep my promises
or reach my goal at all.

270
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,077
But this time, I'm back
and I won't run away!

271
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,347
Not until I defeat that man
and reclaim my shadow!

272
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,439
[BROOK] I'm in a hurry,
so please excuse me,

273
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,341
I'll be on my way now.

274
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,276
Good luck to you.

275
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,011
[FRANKY] Hold on a second!

276
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,185
While you're still
in a mood to talk,

277
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:56,353
there's one more
burning question

278
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:59,023
I still need an answer to.

279
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:24,231
[HOGBACK] That swordsman. That
damned Humming Swordsman!

280
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:27,568
Bastard. That infuriating
troublemaker is the only enemy

281
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:29,637
we have that knows the
weakness of the zombies.

282
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,406
How did he manage
to return here again,

283
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:33,407
and what is she doing?

284
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,410
How much damage has he
managed to do this time?

285
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,647
Cindry! Stop that!
Why do you keep blocking me?!

286
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,416
[PERONA]
The Humming Swordsman.

287
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:44,485
I've heard many
stories about him,

288
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:46,487
but just what kind
of a man is he?

289
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,255
You don't mean
that you've, Perona,

290
00:15:48,255 --> 00:15:51,125
are you saying you've
never seen his face before?

291
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,926
I see, then that's probably how

292
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,262
he slipped past your
ghost network undetected.

293
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:57,264
Yeah, so it would seem.

294
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:00,200
[ABSALOM] Master!

295
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,436
Apparently, that humming pain
in the ass has returned.

296
00:16:02,469 --> 00:16:03,437
Like I care!

297
00:16:03,437 --> 00:16:05,939
Don't bother me with
such nonsense, idiot!

298
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:08,108
I'm busy! You take care of him!

299
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:09,376
[ABSALOM] Hold on!

300
00:16:12,112 --> 00:16:14,648
Kushishishishi!

301
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,123
[ZOMBIE TRIO] Sorry to
keep you waiting, Master!

302
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:26,160
Come on! Let's make our
way to the refrigerator.

303
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:32,066
Kushishishishi!
Kushishishishi!

304
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,501
Master, I have news concerning
the current situation.

305
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,669
[whispering noises]

306
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,505
Eh?! Why didn't you
say so before, fool?

307
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,975
If that's the case, slowing
him down shouldn't be an issue.

308
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:42,843
[SPIDER MOUSE 349D] True!

309
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,311
Keep me informed
of any more problems,

310
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:45,312
should they arise.

311
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:47,481
Now hurry up and dump
Straw Hat on the boat.

312
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:49,416
[SPIDER MICE] You got it!

313
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:55,389
One. Two. Heave ho! Heave ho!
Heave ho! Heave ho! Heave ho!

314
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:56,390
Luffy!

315
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,058
Idiot! Keep quiet!

316
00:16:59,159 --> 00:16:59,927
[USOPP] He lost his shadow!

317
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:01,328
That doesn't mean
that he's dead!

318
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:03,397
Remember? Brook said so!

319
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:07,501
[PERONA] Kumacy! Hurry up!

320
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,505
[USOPP] We can't just
hop out right now.

321
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:13,006
Wait for the right moment.

322
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,242
It sounds like they have
plans for Luffy's shadow.

323
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:16,577
We need to keep hiding
in here to find out

324
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,346
where they're taking it
so we can rescue it later!

325
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:32,126
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 348A] Those two
pirates aren't here anymore.

326
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:33,627
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 348B]
Where'd they run off to?

327
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,729
Hah! To think that
Tararan was defeated.

328
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,197
Impressive.

329
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:42,369
[JIGORO] Here's
where everyone went!

330
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:44,471
[CAPTAIN JOHN] Jigoro,
did you just now get here?

331
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:45,539
Were you lost?

332
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:46,707
[JIGORO] Shut up!

333
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:49,376
More importantly,
where is the enemy?

334
00:17:49,376 --> 00:17:52,646
I must find them
and slice them!

335
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,819
Listen, Franky.

336
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:01,221
What is it? You're
wrong! I'm not crying!

337
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:05,726
I'm not crying, you punk!
Stop looking at me already!

338
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,461
I wanted to know.

339
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:09,329
Why did you ask him about that?

340
00:18:09,396 --> 00:18:10,330
Leave me alone!

341
00:18:10,397 --> 00:18:15,669
I have my reasons, okay?
Dammit! I can't help it!

342
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:18,272
I love that damn skeleton!

343
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,407
He's the nicest guy
in the whole world!

344
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:23,076
It's not fair!

345
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:26,246
Heh! That's true.

346
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:42,262
[humming]

347
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:55,108
[humming]

348
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:23,871
[BROOK] That was scary!

349
00:19:23,904 --> 00:19:25,806
He's so fearsome;

350
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,544
he even gives us
zombies a fright!

351
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:37,184
[BROOK] That was terrifying!
But, I won't give up!

352
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,652
Not this time!

353
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,425
Nyohohoho...

354
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:49,696
Nothing will stop me.

355
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,666
I'll see this battle
through no matter what.

356
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:54,568
I won't run away!

357
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:22,195
Nyohohohahaha...

358
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,377
[BROOK] I'm taking
back my shadow!

359
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:43,483
Kushishishi!
Kushishishi!

360
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,453
Kushiiii!

361
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,755
[HOGBACK] I'm looking
forward to this!

362
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,592
When I first came across this
corpse in the Land of Ice,

363
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,960
I couldn't stop shaking!

364
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:54,561
Honestly, I was trembling!

365
00:20:54,595 --> 00:20:56,263
It's simply
fascinating to think

366
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,665
that such a monstrous creature
was alive and breathing,

367
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:02,235
wreaking havoc across
the seas 500 years ago!

368
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:05,405
The countries that fell at
his hands were taken whole.

369
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:08,442
Under his strength, a legendary
nation of criminals was born.

370
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,744
Imagine my surprise when
I found myself staring

371
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:13,614
at the demon they called
"The Continent Puller."

372
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,349
Man, it keeps getting
colder and colder!

373
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:17,985
Where in the world are
these guys going, anyway?

374
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:20,787
I have no idea, but they
said something earlier,

375
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,024
about some sort of special
refrigerator, didn't they?

376
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:25,859
[USOPP] Oh, yeah! You're right!

377
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:29,930
[CHOPPER]
The Land of Ice? A corpse?

378
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,931
I can't believe

379
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:33,300
I'm going to revive this
extraordinary creature!

380
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,936
This will go down in the books
of Zombie Creation as...

381
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:38,538
Cindry, why do
keep blocking me?

382
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:40,941
[MORIA] Another legend
will be brought back to life!

383
00:21:40,974 --> 00:21:43,877
Kushishi!

384
00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:53,954
It's been quite a
while, hasn't it, 900?

385
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:38,665
The time for his
revival is finally here!

386
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:43,837
Behold! The only warrior
in history who was ruthless

387
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:46,573
and powerful enough to
be given the name "Devil"!

388
00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:49,876
[MORIA] This is Oars!

389
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,407
[USOPP] What the
hell's going on here?

390
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,742
Are they really going
to use Luffy's shadow

391
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,076
to awaken that monster?

392
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,811
[NAMI] I think I finally
understand the mystery

393
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:25,912
of the zombies.

394
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:26,980
Wait! Let go!
What are you doing?

395
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:27,981
[USOPP] Nami! What's wrong?

396
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:30,150
[NAMI] That invisible
bastard is here again!

397
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:33,386
[USOPP] Nami, you're,
you're disappearing!!

398
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,955
[NAMI] What? I am?

399
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:36,490
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

400
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:40,727
"Awakening After 500 Years!!
Oars Opens His Eyes!!"

401
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:43,130
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
