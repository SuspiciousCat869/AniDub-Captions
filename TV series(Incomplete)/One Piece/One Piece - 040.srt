attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:55,962
[ARLONG] You must be aware that
you mere humans can't kill me.

Now, listen. I won't put you
in the ground , Nami...

I'm quite good‐natured.

If possible I'd like you
to be our surveyor

you refuse to come back

86
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:44,344
to the Arlong Pirates and draw
sea charts as one of our own.

87
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,279
And if you decide
to come back with us,

an example of.

Will you come with me
and save the people

or be foolish and refuse

alongside them?

by my side... or not?

This isn't fair...

If I remain friends with
Luffy and the others,

But if I go with Arlong,

106
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,802
everyone from the
village will be saved.

That'll be enough!

[ARLONG] There isn't
a fountain over there.

anywhere near him!

I thought I told you
to never say that again.

Now prepare to die!

145
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,993

that leg weight, he can fight.

146

Luffy, you're the only
one who can fight now!

147
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,638
[ARLONG] In the sea, one
with Devil Fruit powers

148
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,908
is supposed to lose even
the energy to struggle,

149
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:40,413
not to mention his
powers. He will die.

150
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:45,585
And if he's still alive, well,
that wouldn't be fair...

151

You okay?
Please say you're fine!

152
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,356
Sure... I'm fine.

Where'd your pinwheel go?
It was cool.

155
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,032
We've got bigger things
to worry about right now!

156
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,436
[ZORO] Wouldn't be fair?
This game hasn't been fair

157
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,505
from the moment we
started playing it.

158
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,040
Well, anyways.

159
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:12,044
If there's a hindrance,
I should be aware of it.

160
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,946
Correct?

00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,947

here just in time.

00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,297

Go on! Give it to him!

00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,966
[VILLAGERS]
That's where you are?!

168
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,534
He's all right!

169
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,704
Hey, Nami! I beat one of their
leaders. Can you believe it?!

170
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,507
I wiped the smug
off his stupid face.

171
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,980
[laughs] Fishmen are so easy!

172
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,382
[ARLONG]
Hm?

173
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,552
No you... beat choo...

00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,055
Heh. That's right!

175

And now that I'm back it's time
we finish this once and for all.

00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,527
This is the end, Arlong!

177
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,573
[GEZNO] Think... Is there any
way you can free yourself?

178
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,275
Nope. Can't do it.

179
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,611
My energy is way too low...

180
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:22,381
[NOJIKO] Come on!
Come on! Come out!

181
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,353
[JOHNNY]
All right, Cook!

182
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,256
Now if they can just
set big bro Luffy free...

183
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,092
...the Fishmen will be
runnin' for their lives!

184
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,027
Go Zoro!

185
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,030
[YOSAKU] Take down Arlong
once and for all!

186
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,265
[USOPP]
Huh...?

187
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,067
[USOPP]
Ha, ha. Okay!

188
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,468
We have to somehow
prevent Arlong

189
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,870
from getting into the sea...

190
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,540
I'll just keep him from
going anywhere!

191
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,980
[HACHI groans] I... won't
let you have your way...

192
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,284
[USOPP] Hey, Arlong!
I've got a present for you!

193
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,618
[ARLONG]
Huh?

194
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,121
Uh! What's he doin'?

195
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,156
He's so brave!

196
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,960
Usopp! Rubberband of Doom!

197
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,162
[ARLONG] You seem to keep
standing in my way...

198
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,631
I take it you wish
to die first, then.

199
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,467
I can take care of that.

200
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,502
Zoro! Now!

201
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,271
What do you think you're
doing, Usopp?!

202
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,508
[ZORO]
Now's my chance.

203
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:26,178
All I want is a piece
of that proud nose!

204
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,017
You fool!

205
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:36,655
It's a proud nose
because it's unbreakable.

206
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,959
If you were at full strength...

207
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:44,029
...you may have been able
to give it a little scratch.

208
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,437
[ZORO panting]

209
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,542
[ARLONG chuckles]

210
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,445
Ahh! No!

211
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,213
Look, over there!

212
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,048
[YOSAKU]
Hmm? Huh...?

213
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,651
That damn octopus is up!

214
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,388
[YOSAKU]
What's he doing?

215
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,626
[HACHI]
Uhh?! Seriously?!

216
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,328
I thought the rubber band
was gonna fly at me!

217
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,530
[VILLAGERS]
What?!

218
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,232
[USOPP]
What?!

219
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:24,703
[laughing] He saw what
I was aiming for!

220
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,373
But weren't you yelling
"Arlong," huh?

221
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,742
[ZORO pants]
Oh, great...

222
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,510
[HACHI]
We're not done, Zoro!

223
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,480
You may have put me down,
but it wasn't for good.

224
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,748
Cause I'm still alive,

225
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:39,051
and now I'm gonna finish
off your friend!

226
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,088
[ZORO gasps]

227
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,693
[ARLONG chuckles]
No need to be concerned‐‐

228
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,729
seeing as how you will
all be dead anyway.

229
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,431
[ZORO gasping]

230
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,234
[ZORO groans]

231
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,269
[ALL gasp]

232
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,072
[JOHNNY, YOSAKU]
Big bro!

233
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,129
[ARLONG chuckles]

234
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,034
[ZORO groans]

235
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:50,623
[SANJI] You've done enough,
Nojiko. Leave the rest to me!

236
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,594
[NOJIKO]
A fishman!

237
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,399
[SANJI] Watch out! I'll break
the rock with a kick!

238
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,439
[SANJI]
What?!

239
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:11,176
Octopus... Fritter Frenzy!

240
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,611
No!

241
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,313
[HACHI grunting]

242
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,820
[USOPP]
Zoro!

243
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,689
[ZORO grunting]

244
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:29,595
So, that's it, huh?
Way too easy...

245
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:35,334
[ARLONG]
What's with all these bandages?

246
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,369
[ARLONG]
Did you have a good fall?

247
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,137
[ZORO screams]

248
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,838
[ARLONG grunts]

249
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,777
[ARLONG]
What's this scar...?

250
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,478
[NAMI gasping]

251
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,048
[BOTH crying]

252
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,320
[USOPP whimpers]

253
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,126
[ARLONG] I can't believe
he's breathing...

254
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,297
How can he still be alive
with a body like this?

255
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,144
[ARLONG]
Is he dying already...?

256
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:23,215
Am I fighting a wounded man?

257
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:27,419
Either way, he's about to die...

258
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,590
He's going to die
right here and now!

259
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,393
[ZORO groaning]

260
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,561
[laughs]

261
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,862
[ARLONG]
Hm?

262
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,199
[ZORO]
If a person stays put...

263
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,836
...their wounds won't open up...

264
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:49,575
[ARLONG] Is that right? Do you
find your situation amusing?

265
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,744
[ZORO laughs]

266
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,513
[ZORO]
I'm not talking about me.

267
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,616
I'm talking about the Octo‐Man.

268
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,351
[ARLONG]
What?!

269
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:04,456
[ZORO] I thought I told you.
We'll win this game!

270
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,426
[HACHI groaning]

271
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,441
[SANJI]
That was too close.

272
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,249
[SANJI] You're the one
that made this complicated

273
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,917
in the first place!

274
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,221
[NOJIKO]
He did it!

275
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,924
[SANJI] It's time to take
care of that shark!

276
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,493
Hurry up, you idiot!

277
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,328
[LUFFY grunting]

278
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,897
Did they free you?

279
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,299
Yes!

280
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,937
[LUFFY yelling]

281
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:59,678
[LUFFY]
I'm back! Ha, ha!

282
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,247
[VILLAGERS cheering]

283
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,749
It's him!

284
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,652
Our hero's back!

285
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,822
[USOPP cheers]

286
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:15,294
[gasps] Luffy!

287
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:21,300
[ARLONG]
That rubber bastard...

288
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,535
You're... a bit late...

289
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,037
[LUFFY chuckles]

290
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,705
[LUFFY]
Zoro!

291
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,439
[ZORO grunts]

292
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:31,276
Hey! Hold on... what're you...

293
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,612
[LUFFY laughs]

294
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,447
[ZORO screams]

295
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,715
Let's switch!

296
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,451
[ZORO screams]

297
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,720
[ALL] You idiot!!

298
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:46,225
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum... Bell!

299
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,362
[LUFFY]
And whip!

300
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,698
[JOHNNY, YOSAKU gasp]

301
00:18:56,668 --> 00:19:01,340
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum... Pistol!

302
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,246
[LUFFY]
Gatling!

303
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,823
Yes!

304
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,763
[ALL gasping]

305
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,441
[ARLONG]
Is that all you got?

306
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,711
[JOHNNY, YOSAKU]
It's not working!

307
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,914
Nope. Just a warm up.

308
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:52,357
[ZORO groans]
That idiot!

309
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,458
I'm gonna kill him!

310
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,028
[LUFFY grunting]

311
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,136
[ARLONG]
What a bunch of fools.

312
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,872
You think you can
actually beat me?

313
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,608
You were better off drowning
on the ocean floor.

314
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,543
[LUFFY]
No, I don't think so.

315
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,312
I like it up here.

316
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,880
Yep.

317
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,620
Do you not understand my anger?

318
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:25,224
I saw my brothers
crushed like worms.

319
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,228
[ARLONG]
You'll realize soon enough

320
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:33,565
that you should've quite
fighting a long time ago.

321
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,335
Do you think Luffy's
gonna be ok?

322
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,470
I mean Arlong doesn't
seem to be effected

323
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,072
by his attacks at all...

324
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,006
And more importantly,

325
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,009
just how far away do
you think Zoro flew?!

326
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,412
Luffy! I've got your back, pal!

327
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,514
[NAMI] No need to worry.

328
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:00,659
[SANJI] If he loses...
then we'll all... die.

329
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,661
[GENZO]
Yeah. We will.

330
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:07,266
[NOJIKO] If that happens, it's
the end of the East Blue, too...

331
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,340
Do you know what
the biggest difference

332
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,176
between you and me is?

333
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,945
The nose?

334
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,283
The jaw?

335
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,353
Umm...? What's he doing?

336
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:32,024
Uhh... I don't know.

337
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:32,958
Webbing!

338
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:36,161
[ARLONG growls]
Species!

Oh, man! I bet that
had to be painful.

346
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,148
His teeth must be shattered.

through that stone pillar!

351
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,494

Wow...

352
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,998
If he bites you,
he won't just leave marks,

353
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,234
he'll bite right
through your bones!

354
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,342
[ARLONG] You see? This is
the inherent power of fishmen.

355
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,011
I feel sorry for you humans
having been created

356
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,180
with such limited power.

357
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,183
We've been on a different level
since the beginning of time.

358
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,684
You are inferior.

359
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,355
It only makes sense for
you to bow before me.

360
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,056
You're so weak.

361
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,359
Your presence on this
planet is deplorable.

362
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,028
Don't you think your time
has come to an end?

363
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:46,531
[chuckles] I'll show you...

364
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,535
...show you the real difference
between you and I...

365
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,741
Sure. Go ahead.

366
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:59,144
There's no way I'm
losing to a fishman.

367
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,545
Because...

368
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,715
...I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates!

369
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,452
<i>♪All that's in my heart</i>
<i>confuses me</i>

370
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,454
<i>I cannot understand</i>

371
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,556
<i>As I face what I must do</i>

372
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,326
<i>I'll say goodbye</i>
<i>and squeeze your hand</i>

373
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,128
<i>I'll set sail alone</i>

374
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,398
<i>But always know</i>
<i>I'm gonna keep you near</i>

375
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,133
<i>As I drift away</i>

376
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,736
<i>I pray you watch me</i>
<i>as I disappear</i>

377
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,610
<i>As I watch the sunrise</i>

378
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,146
<i>I began to wonder</i>

379
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:39,084
<i>What could be the reason</i>
<i>It's so hot inside</i>

380
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,319
<i>No answer has come</i>

381
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:45,424
<i>But I can't get away</i>
<i>from what's true</i>

382
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:50,295
<i>It's because of you</i>

383
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,497
<i>Show me how to</i>
<i>catch those feelings</i>

384
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,167
<i>Get 'em to come back to me</i>

385
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,668
<i>I'll do what I must</i>

386
00:23:56,701 --> 00:24:00,105
<i>Because they're</i>
<i>everything I wanna be</i>

387
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,274
<i>Wrap these arms around my dreams</i>

388
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,776
<i>And pull 'em back from yesterday</i>

389
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,279
<i>If I'm holding hands with you</i>

390
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,115
<i>I'm sure that we can</i>
<i>make the way♪</i>

391
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,724
[LUFFY]
Hey! Where did Arlong go?

392
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,126
[NAMI]
The sea!

393
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,294
[LUFFY]
The sea?

394
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,495
Whoa! There's a shark!

395
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,796
[USOPP]
That's Arlong!

396
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,797
[LUFFY]
He ran away?

397
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,798
[SANJI]
This isn't good!

398
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,334
He gets even stronger
when he's in the water.

399
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,502
[USOPP]
Ahh! Watch out!

400
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,704
[LUFFY screams]

401
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,406
[STRAW HATS]
Luffy!

402
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,241
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

403
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:40,245
"Explosion! Fishman Arlong's
Fierce Assault from the Sea!"

404
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,181
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
