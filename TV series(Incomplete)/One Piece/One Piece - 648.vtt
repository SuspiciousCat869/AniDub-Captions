WEBVTT

00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:30.247
[cackles]

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.557
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.292
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:38.496
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.239
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:37.949
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.983 --> 00:02:40.822
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:46.132
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.771
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.804 --> 00:02:51.944
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:53.881
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.286
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.324
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:03.768
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:05.403
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:09.044
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:13.386
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:19.999
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.440
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:26.179
Their current objective is to
destroy a man-made

00:03:26.212 --> 00:03:29.485
Devil Fruit Factory in the
kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.423
When Luffy hears about
a fighting tournament

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:32.793
at the Corrida Colosseum

00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:35.263
with the Flame Flame
Fruit as the prize,

00:03:35.297 --> 00:03:37.234
he decides to join
and compete against

00:03:37.268 --> 00:03:40.575
titanic contenders from
all over the New World.

00:03:40.608 --> 00:03:42.979
[CHIN JAO] They called me,
"Chin Jao the Drill."

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:44.082
Because at one time,

00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:48.156
my head possessed an
extraordinary shape.

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:49.726
And so I ask,

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:53.501
do you have any clue what
pain Garp inflicted on me?

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:55.805
For the millionth time,
how should I know?

00:03:55.838 --> 00:03:57.508
Maybe you truly are ignorant

00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:59.779
and don't know the
sins of your family,

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:03.754
but since you're his grandson,
I can't let you walk away!

00:04:03.787 --> 00:04:06.059
[CHIN JAO growls]

00:04:06.092 --> 00:04:08.196
[CHIN JAO]
It may have been 30 years ago,

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.906
but I'm filled with rage
like it was yesterday!

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.909
[CHIN JAO yells]

00:04:19.485 --> 00:04:21.222
I want to hear you say it!

00:04:21.256 --> 00:04:25.063
Admit that I was wronged
with your dying breath!

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.175
That fiend! He took
away my treasure!

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:33.581
[wailing]

00:04:33.614 --> 00:04:35.016
Hey, soldier.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.889
What were you trying to prove
to me back there with the dog?

00:04:37.922 --> 00:04:39.593
What's going on here?

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:42.732
Simple. This kingdom's divided.

00:04:42.766 --> 00:04:45.470
A country filled
with the forgotten.

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:47.241
And those who forget them!

00:04:47.274 --> 00:04:48.443
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:04:48.477 --> 00:04:53.286
Every toy you see was
at one point a human!

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.692
What?!

00:04:55.725 --> 00:04:58.698
Someone came to our
island ten years ago

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.935
courtesy of Doflmaingo.

00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:04.242
They turned us into toys
with their Devil Fruit power!

00:05:04.275 --> 00:05:07.615
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:10.855
Come on, pick up!
Nami! What happened?

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.100
[LAW grunts]

00:05:21.242 --> 00:05:23.948
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
No mercy for the wicked!

00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:26.921
It'd be quicker,
if I wasn't all thumbs.

00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:30.293
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

00:05:30.326 --> 00:05:33.032
What're you waiting for, Nami?

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.638
You were attacked,
weren't you? [gasps]

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.652
[YOUNG DWARF A]
It's Usoland's Haki!

00:05:42.685 --> 00:05:44.857
[DWARF A]
He truly is a legend!

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.627
See, what did I tell ya?

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.798
My body's trembling
with so much excitement,

00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:51.168
it's making the earth
shake all around us!

00:05:51.202 --> 00:05:52.939
[YOUNG DWARF A]
How awesome is that?

00:05:52.973 --> 00:05:55.144
[DWARF A]
His power is off the charts!

00:05:55.177 --> 00:05:57.181
[gasps]

00:05:57.214 --> 00:05:58.684
One question, Leo.

00:05:58.717 --> 00:06:00.789
Your people keep mentioning
some "final battle"

00:06:00.822 --> 00:06:02.491
involving yours truly,

00:06:02.525 --> 00:06:05.865
but what reason do you
want to fight Doflamingo?

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:06.766
Huh?

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.638
Not just a hero,
but a comedian, too!

00:06:08.671 --> 00:06:09.506
It's because we want to

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:12.110
rescue 500 of our
closest friends!

00:06:12.144 --> 00:06:14.382
Over at the secret
factory in Dressrosa

00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:18.991
where they're being
enslaved of course!

00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:20.995
Our fight is in Dressrosa!

00:06:21.028 --> 00:06:22.565
Beneath the Colosseum!

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.368
Inside the factory!

00:06:24.402 --> 00:06:25.370
Everyone!

00:06:25.404 --> 00:06:27.240
Go!

00:06:27.274 --> 00:06:30.113
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:06:32.417 --> 00:06:36.793
[LUFFY] "Making a Sortie!
The Legendary Hero Usoland"

00:06:43.908 --> 00:06:49.251
[DWARVES]
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland...

00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:12.497
Where, now?

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:13.934
We'll show ya!

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:15.203
There's an underground tunnel

00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:17.908
that connects
Green Bit to Dressrosa.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.282
You want us to go
through that tunnel

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:23.319
and meet your buddies
on the other side?

00:07:23.352 --> 00:07:25.424
[LEO]
That's right!

00:07:25.457 --> 00:07:26.694
[USOPP]
These little guys really think

00:07:26.727 --> 00:07:29.432
they're gonna pick
a fight with Doflamingo?

00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:32.270
We finally made it!
There's the airport!

00:07:32.304 --> 00:07:32.872
[ROBIN, USOPP gasp]

00:07:42.592 --> 00:07:43.827
[laughs]

00:07:43.861 --> 00:07:46.032
[chuckles]

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:49.939
Oh, wow! This is way
nicer than I expected!

00:07:49.973 --> 00:07:52.812
Goodness. Isn't that cute?

00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:54.080
[DWARF A]
Attention!

00:07:54.114 --> 00:07:58.590
Yellow Kabu 43 through 48
are now prepared for takeoff.

00:07:58.624 --> 00:08:00.761
Please remain on standby.

00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:06.038
Requesting Pink Bee
21, 22, 25, and 26

00:08:06.071 --> 00:08:08.777
to make their way to
Runway B immediately.

00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:11.015
Yellow Kabu 43 buzzing in.

00:08:11.048 --> 00:08:12.985
I'm ready for takeoff!

00:08:13.018 --> 00:08:18.530
[DWARF A] Yellow Kabu 43,
you're cleared for takeoff.

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:20.099
Pink Bee Squad here.

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:21.970
We're ready when you are!

00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:23.507
[DWARF A]
Roger that, Pink Bee.

00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:26.212
All bug units stand by
for further instruction.

00:08:26.246 --> 00:08:29.418
Oh, and, Usoland, please watch
your step among the aircraft!

00:08:29.452 --> 00:08:30.454
Oh, sorry!

00:08:30.487 --> 00:08:33.360
Hey, you guys! I'm here!

00:08:33.393 --> 00:08:36.566
Leo! It's about time!

00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:44.014
Preparations complete!
Let's take to the air, shall we?

00:08:46.285 --> 00:08:47.989
I'm countin' on you, okay?

00:08:48.022 --> 00:08:49.058
[KABU]
Don't worry!

00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:51.062
This is exactly
what our squad members

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:53.465
have been tirelessly
training to tackle!

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:57.742
He's right. We'll save Princess
Mancherie and our friends!

00:08:57.776 --> 00:08:58.877
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.413
[LEO]
Mm!

00:09:00.447 --> 00:09:02.752
This is definitely first.

00:09:03.654 --> 00:09:05.156
I gotta show Luffy!

00:09:05.189 --> 00:09:07.360
You aren't as compact as we are.

00:09:07.394 --> 00:09:10.367
You'll have to hop aboard our
special 20-passenger buses

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.536
if ya don't mind.

00:09:11.569 --> 00:09:12.738
[ROBIN gasps]

00:09:13.807 --> 00:09:16.145
Lin-year foxes,
please report in!

00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:17.113
[LINEAR FOX A barks]

00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:19.217
[ROBIN, USOPP gasp]

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:30.340
This isn't bad! We're
gonna ride in style!

00:09:30.373 --> 00:09:32.143
[LEO]
They're really fast, too!

00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:33.648
Such beautiful fur.

00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:34.882
[LINEAR FOX A squeaks]

00:09:42.798 --> 00:09:45.236
It's time to take
flight, everybody!

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.644
With Usoland, beside us,
there's no way we can lose!

00:09:48.677 --> 00:09:50.213
[USOPP]
Hm.

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:03.405
We'll bring our friends back
and Princess Mancherie, too!

00:10:03.439 --> 00:10:05.376
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.367
Man, these things
are fast! [chuckles]

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.806
[GANCHO]
I suppose I should explain...

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:22.110
[USOPP]
Hm?

00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:24.214
...why we want to do this.

00:10:24.248 --> 00:10:26.018
What are you
doing in there, perv?!

00:10:26.051 --> 00:10:27.187
Chief Gancho!

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.026
[GANCHO]
Hm? Oh! Yes, at your service.

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:33.533
And thank you for the best
seat on the bus, my dear!

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:35.403
Hm?

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:37.975
Since you're generous enough to

00:10:38.009 --> 00:10:39.980
lay down your
lives for our cause,

00:10:40.013 --> 00:10:43.520
there's something that
I think you should know first.

00:10:43.553 --> 00:10:46.091
[USOPP]
Don't remember promising that.

00:10:46.124 --> 00:10:49.264
Doflamingo has caused
a great deal of suffering,

00:10:49.298 --> 00:10:52.070
especially for
the Tontatta tribe.

00:10:52.103 --> 00:10:54.141
But our troubled
relationship with his group

00:10:54.174 --> 00:10:57.581
actually began long before
he took over the throne.

00:11:03.026 --> 00:11:04.327
[GANCHO]
In fact,

00:11:04.361 --> 00:11:08.536
the beginning of this sad tale
stretches back over 900 years.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.477
[USOPP]
What?

00:11:12.512 --> 00:11:14.247
[NARRATOR]
Here in Dressrosa,

00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:18.222
there grows a vast
field of sunflowers.

00:11:19.692 --> 00:11:22.866
[NARRATOR] And somewhere
nestled among those blooms

00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:26.072
in an unknown location,

00:11:26.105 --> 00:11:28.209
there is a secret entrance.

00:11:28.242 --> 00:11:30.515
Follow the winding
spiral staircase

00:11:30.548 --> 00:11:32.785
deep into the ground...

00:11:34.288 --> 00:11:38.964
[NARRATOR] ...and a cacophony
of excited voices can be heard.

00:11:38.997 --> 00:11:40.200
[DWARVES shouting]

00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:42.304
[FRANKY] Where the
heck are you takin' me?

00:11:42.337 --> 00:11:43.873
[TOY SOLDIER]
You'll see.

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:49.552
Allow me to introduce you...

00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:51.590
The Commander!

00:11:51.623 --> 00:11:55.163
We've waited so long!
We're glad you finally made it!

00:11:55.197 --> 00:11:57.100
Thank you! At ease!

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.905
[DWARVES cheering]

00:12:03.045 --> 00:12:06.018
Who's that tall,
tough-looking guy, sir?

00:12:06.052 --> 00:12:08.222
It'll be great to have
a Big Person like him

00:12:08.255 --> 00:12:09.225
on our side, huh?

00:12:09.258 --> 00:12:11.763
There's no way we'll
lose the battle now!

00:12:11.796 --> 00:12:14.836
Those are the Little
People from Tontatta.

00:12:14.869 --> 00:12:17.240
They will be fighting
Doflamingo with us.

00:12:17.274 --> 00:12:18.577
Say what?!

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.716
They're more of a threat than
you might think, my friend.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.120
They move so fast,
they're almost invisible.

00:12:24.154 --> 00:12:26.491
The townspeople
call them "fairies."

00:12:26.526 --> 00:12:30.968
Oh! Wait, so when Zoro's
sword disappeared before...

00:12:34.475 --> 00:12:37.681
[WICKA] Come on! I thought you
wanted to get back to your ship!

00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:38.617
Huh?

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.821
[ZORO]
Damn, Luffy, get it together!

00:12:40.854 --> 00:12:43.493
[OLD DWARF A] Young man,
will you please sit down?

00:12:43.527 --> 00:12:44.596
Huh?!

00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:46.766
After everything it
took to get you this far!

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.639
Since when do you have time
to stop and watch the fight?

00:12:49.672 --> 00:12:52.578
Ahh! You're such a
big, dumb stupidhead!

00:12:52.611 --> 00:12:56.051
That sneaky little bastard.
There's a fighting competition

00:12:56.084 --> 00:12:58.089
and he doesn't
bother telling me?

00:12:58.122 --> 00:12:59.759
I could've cleaned up!

00:12:59.793 --> 00:13:02.565
[gasps, yells] Commander!

00:13:02.598 --> 00:13:04.268
Huh? You're here, too?

00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:06.806
I'm just as surprised
to see you, buddy.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.075
Commander!

00:13:08.109 --> 00:13:11.081
We've already reviewed the
intel from the scouting unit!

00:13:11.114 --> 00:13:12.651
We know everything that Sugar

00:13:12.684 --> 00:13:14.556
and the enemy have
been up to, sir!

00:13:14.589 --> 00:13:15.758
And, as it turns out,

00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:18.964
just in time for our big
confrontation with Doflamingo.

00:13:18.997 --> 00:13:22.471
Also! Some legendary heroes
have appeared in our kingdom,

00:13:22.505 --> 00:13:23.907
and they're going
to help us fight!

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.813
Uh, their names are
Usoland and Robiland!

00:13:26.847 --> 00:13:29.653
They're on their way
here as we speak!

00:13:29.686 --> 00:13:31.088
And they've got a
whole group of friends

00:13:31.122 --> 00:13:32.290
here with them, too!

00:13:32.324 --> 00:13:33.727
Let's see.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.333
It says their names are
Luffyland, Zoroland, Namiland,

00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:40.607
Sanland, Chopperland,
Fraland, and Boneland!

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.410
[FRANKY, ZORO]
Sounds like Usopp.

00:13:42.444 --> 00:13:45.016
[ZORO] That's the best
he could come up with?

00:13:45.049 --> 00:13:48.489
Eh, okay, I'm Zoroland, I guess.

00:13:48.524 --> 00:13:51.328
And I'm the famous Fraland,
here to save the day.

00:13:51.362 --> 00:13:53.533
[DWARVES]
Wow, that's great!

00:13:53.566 --> 00:13:54.569
[DWARVES crying]

00:13:54.602 --> 00:13:56.472
[FRANKY, ZORO]
So naïve.

00:13:56.506 --> 00:13:58.910
Uh! I don't have time for this!

00:13:58.943 --> 00:14:01.916
I have to get back to the
Sunny before it's too late!

00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:04.522
[WICKA groans] I have been
saying that this whole time!

00:14:04.555 --> 00:14:06.058
[FRANKY]
Hm? The Sunny?

00:14:11.636 --> 00:14:14.007
[GYATS]
Lucy deftly dodges again!

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.013
The warriors from Kano showed
some potential early on,

00:14:17.047 --> 00:14:19.886
but surprisingly, they've been
outpaced by their grandfather,

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.188
who just won't quit!

00:14:21.221 --> 00:14:24.696
Will the infamous gangster Don
Chin Jao emerge victorious?

00:14:24.729 --> 00:14:27.033
Or will the mysterious
newcomer, Lucy,

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:30.005
keep that momentum till the end?

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:32.945
Try and dodge
this one, you brat!

00:14:32.978 --> 00:14:35.316
Now, Hasshoken.

00:14:35.349 --> 00:14:37.755
Head-Arms Spin!

00:14:39.224 --> 00:14:41.361
You did that already!

00:14:48.243 --> 00:14:49.846
[LUFFY]
Oh, yeah?

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:51.816
Well, Gum-Gum...

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.223
[CHIN JAO] I'll knock you
straight out of the New World!

00:14:55.256 --> 00:14:58.128
[LUFFY]
...Jet Cannon!

00:14:58.162 --> 00:14:59.364
[CHIN JAO growling]

00:14:59.397 --> 00:15:01.636
[LUFFY yelling]

00:15:28.756 --> 00:15:30.727
Well, Gum-Gum...

00:15:30.761 --> 00:15:34.936
[CHIN JAO] I'll knock you
straight out of the New World!

00:15:34.969 --> 00:15:37.541
[LUFFY]
...Jet Cannon!

00:15:38.442 --> 00:15:41.315
[yells]

00:15:41.348 --> 00:15:43.285
How can that be?!

00:15:44.321 --> 00:15:45.991
[CHIN JAO grunts]

00:15:49.164 --> 00:15:50.934
[LUFFY]
Jet Whip!

00:15:50.968 --> 00:15:53.573
[CHIN JAO grunting]

00:15:54.642 --> 00:15:59.083
[CROWD cheering]

00:16:02.859 --> 00:16:05.263
[KIN'EMON]
Fight valiantly, Sir Luffy!

00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:07.466
There's no time for spectating!

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.308
But he mustn't lose! His
honor is at stake after all!

00:16:11.342 --> 00:16:14.782
Weren't you in a hurry to rescue
your friend from the Toy House?

00:16:14.816 --> 00:16:16.018
Did you forget that?

00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:19.090
Ahh! The thought did escape me!

00:16:23.265 --> 00:16:24.702
[COMPETITOR A]
Hm? Agh!

00:16:24.735 --> 00:16:29.845
[BURGESS laughing]

00:16:33.485 --> 00:16:34.722
[BOTH]
It's Burgess!

00:16:34.755 --> 00:16:38.630
I heard things were
heatin' up around here!

00:16:38.663 --> 00:16:42.003
[BURGESS grunts]
Hey, who's the small fry?

00:16:55.563 --> 00:17:00.574
[LAW panting]

00:17:02.578 --> 00:17:04.782

[DOFLAMINGO]
Well, how 'bout that?

00:17:24.154 --> 00:17:27.327
Nowhere left for you
to run now, is there?

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.599
--[LAW panting]
--[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.839
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Joker, wait!

00:17:32.872 --> 00:17:34.141
Kill him if you like,

00:17:34.174 --> 00:17:37.146
but there's something I need
you to take back from him first!

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.788
That ruffian stole my heart
right out of my chest!

00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:43.325
I shudder to think
what he'll do with it!

00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:44.127
[DOFLAMINGO grunts]

00:17:44.161 --> 00:17:45.898
[LAW]
Room!

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:47.835
And then Shambles!

[DOFLAMINGO grunts]

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.086
Run while you still can, Law.

00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:06.472
[GIOLLA]
It's no use!

00:18:06.506 --> 00:18:09.778
You can't stifle my
artistic expression!

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.183
[NAMI grunts]

00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:16.091
Now, Blow Kung-fu... Art!

[NAMI yelps]

00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:19.665
This is just smoke!

Well, two can play that game!

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:23.305
Try my Weather Egg on for size!

00:18:23.338 --> 00:18:26.813
Snow Clouds, fill
the sky, now...?

00:18:26.846 --> 00:18:29.752
[STAFF groans]

00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:31.522
[GIOLLA]
Huh?

00:18:34.695 --> 00:18:38.904
Ah! My poor Clima Takt! You
turned it into some weird toy!

00:18:38.937 --> 00:18:42.110
[GIOLLA cackles]
My, oh my!

00:18:42.143 --> 00:18:43.980
No need to flatter me, my dear!

00:18:44.013 --> 00:18:45.016
Like I would!

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:47.286
Well, as beautiful as it may be,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.558
that staff of
yours is not a toy!

00:18:49.591 --> 00:18:51.461
Make no mistake!

00:18:51.495 --> 00:18:52.798
[NAMI]
Uhh...

00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:55.771
Although, there is a Devil Fruit
user in the Don Quixote Family

00:18:55.804 --> 00:18:57.674
who can transform
people into toys,

00:18:57.708 --> 00:19:01.616
I possess the power of
the Art Art Fruit, remember?

00:19:01.649 --> 00:19:05.624
The masterpieces I create
aren't toys at all!

00:19:05.657 --> 00:19:08.129
Masterpieces, really?!

00:19:08.162 --> 00:19:09.833
Oh, no!

00:19:09.866 --> 00:19:11.969
Nami can't fight her!

And with bunny
rabbits for hooves,

00:19:13.573 --> 00:19:17.614
there's not much I can
do either! [squeaks]

00:19:17.648 --> 00:19:19.184
Help me, I'm scared!

00:19:19.217 --> 00:19:21.054
Please, don't let
her take me away!

00:19:21.087 --> 00:19:24.027
She'll have to pry you
from my cold, dead hands!

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.131
Though, unfortunately...

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:31.041
With no guitar, that might
be a very real possibility.

00:19:31.075 --> 00:19:33.580
You act as though this
is some sort of tragedy!

00:19:33.613 --> 00:19:35.182
You should be thrilled.

You were the ones who went
and obliterated my submarine!

My poor henchmen.

you could answer that?

gave them Caesar!

00:23:15.089 --> 00:23:17.694
[NARRATOR] After Chin Jao's
bitter history is revealed,

00:23:17.727 --> 00:23:20.533
the battle to determine the
strongest contender in Block C

00:23:20.566 --> 00:23:21.835
comes to a head.

00:23:21.869 --> 00:23:24.140
As Luffy and Chin Jao
unleash the full brunt

00:23:24.174 --> 00:23:25.944
of their abilities
against each other,

00:23:25.978 --> 00:23:27.080
their ultimate techniques

00:23:27.113 --> 00:23:30.152
will tear through
the very earth and sky!

00:23:30.186 --> 00:23:32.022
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.056 --> 00:23:36.131
"The Fierce Battle Coming to
the End! Lucy vs. Chin Jao!"

00:23:36.431 --> 00:23:39.303
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
