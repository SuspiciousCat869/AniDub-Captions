1
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:08,275
Don't go, Robin!
We're not done talking yet!

2
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:13,313
No. It's over. This is the
last time you'll see me.

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,687
Luffy! Go after Robin- whatever
happens, don't let her get away!

4
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,594
Robin!

5
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,238
I don't believe it.
How can they be so strong?

6
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,380
I knew you were tough,
but this's too much.

7
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,048
We're not like you.

8
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,652
As members of CP9, for as
long as we can remember.

9
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:55,288
We've trained to surpass
the limits of the human body.

10
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,660
The ignition device
is about to detonate.

11
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,494
We should probably hurry.

12
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,699
But a chance like
this one is quite rare.

13
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,134
Let me show you
something interesting.

14
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,057
Devil Fruit powers!

15
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,561
Which one is it?

16
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:45,305
Lucci. What in the...?

17
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,175
Cat-Cat Fruit.

18
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,315
The Leopard model.

19
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,153
A human leopard!

20
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,688
He's huge!

21
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:06,760
What's going on here?
What in the hell are you?!

22
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,357
Fire!

23
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,626
Emergency! Everybody wake up!

24
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,429
Damn them! Those pirates
started this, didn't they?!

25
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,697
We need to do something, quick!

26
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,499
There are still a lot
of people left inside!

27
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,535
Iceberg might be trapped!
Let's make sure he made it out!

28
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,571
Right! Come on!

29
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:34,507
The rest of you--
put out that fire! Go! Go!

30
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:50,323
It appears the fire
is beginning to spread.

31
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:56,497
Leopard. Human.
Whatever the hell you are.

32
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,267
You're not gonna lay one
finger on Iceberg. You hear me?!

33
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,439
No! He's a Carnivore Zoan-type!

34
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,474
They're the most
brutal of them all!

35
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:13,047
Indeed. Logia types.
Zoan types. Paramythia types.

36
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,350
Each one extremely powerful
in their own unique way.

37
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,787
The ability to enhance one's
own personal strength happens

38
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,056
to be the specialty
of the Zoan type.

39
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:26,426
In other words, the more
we train, the stronger we get.

40
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,332
Which makes the Zoan
type the most lethal

41
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,368
when it comes to
attacks at close range.

42
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,069
Shut the hell up!

43
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:41,442
Nobody here gives a damn
about what monster can do what!

44
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,644
Just as well, we're
running out of time.

45
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,547
Before the flames
engulf this place.

46
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,084
We need to make sure that all
of you are properly disposed of.

47
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,151
Iceberg!

48
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,485
Go! Move it!

49
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:57,391
Lucci. The workmen are
making their way up the stairs.

50
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,594
Don't worry.
They'll never make it this far.

51
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,529
Tempest Kick!

52
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,610
Go back!
The ceiling's collapsing!

53
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,587
Nami!

54
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,165
Chopper!

55
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,366
What are you doing?

56
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,635
No matter what,
I'm getting you out of here!

57
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,371
There's no way!
Your wounds are far too...

58
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,542
I'm afraid we
can't let you do that.

59
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:56,483
And I'm afraid,
you're gonna have to!

60
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:05,425
Step aside. Get outta my way!

61
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:15,702
Damn you! Why did it
have to be you guys?!

62
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:21,642
No. I can't believe you.

63
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,444
How could you do this?!

64
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:27,047
You tricked me!
I thought you were my friends!

65
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,153
Then you were mistaken.

66
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,301
Talking pigeon jerk!

67
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,135
Luffy, what are you...?!

68
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,776
Finger Pistol.

69
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,546
Luffy!

70
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,006
Have a nice flight!

71
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,480
Luffy!

72
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,685
Damn you!

73
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,452
Iron Body!

74
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,003
Zoro!

75
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,485
Now it's your turn.

76
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,528
Granny! Granny!
There's a huge fire!

77
00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:00,400
It's Galley-La's main office.
Such a terrible thing to do.

78
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,571
What do you mean, Granny?

79
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,406
Did someone start
the fire on purpose?

80
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,208
Well, I can't
really say for sure.

81
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,644
But usually, when I
get a bad feeling,

82
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,446
it turns out to be right.

83
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,382
I sure hope that
Iceberg is doing okay.

84
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,652
Seriously.

85
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,155
All this is happening
over that thing.

86
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,223
It shouldn't even exist.

87
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,603
The testimony of a pirate
won't hold up as evidence.

88
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:40,074
This case will remain a mystery.

89
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:44,378
Iceberg. No matter how great of
a shipbuilding engineer you are,

90
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:48,115
no matter how great a mayor.

91
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,050
A mere individual
citizen shouldn't

92
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,519
oppose the World Government.

93
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,698
Let's go. We need to
find Tom's other apprentice,

94
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,768
Franky or rather Cutty Flam,

95
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,070
and take those
blueprints away from him.

96
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,656
Did everyone make it out?

97
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,625
It's taken the building.
We can't go back inside.

98
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,228
Have each team check to
see if anyone's missing!

99
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:38,098
Hey! Have you heard anything
about Iceberg? Is he safe?

100
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,634
Don't tell me. He's not
stuck in there, is he?

101
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,736
Of course not!
The foremen are with him.

102
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,438
There's no way
they left him behind.

103
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,307
Search the area! I'm sure
he's here somewhere!

104
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:57,685
Hey, wait. That woman's one of
the Straw Hats! I'm sure of it!

105
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,220
Did she jump out
from one of the windows?

106
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,289
She probably got
trapped by the fire

107
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,558
and didn't have any
other choice in the matter.

108
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,627
Well, what should
we do with her?

109
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,530
These damn pirates have
done a terrible thing here.

110
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,399
Let's make her tell us
where the rest of her crew is!

111
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,435
We'll hunt them down and
turn them over to the Navy!

112
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:25,579
You're sure of it?

113
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,415
You saw Franky wandering
into your bar earlier?

114
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,117
Yeah. I spoke with him.

115
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,219
But he took off to
go look for Straw Hat.

116
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,256
I see.

117
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:39,460
Seems like he doesn't stay
in one place for very long.

118
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:44,365
Wow. Some people just have
the worst sense of timing.

119
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:46,233
Look there.

120
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:50,371
Listen up, Straw Hat!
We've got Long Nose!

121
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:52,506
That's right!
We totally have him!

122
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,576
If you don't want him
to sing in the key of C!

123
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,245
You idiot! How many times
do I have to tell you?!

124
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,381
It's "If you don't want
him to sink into the sea"!

125
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:01,348
Drink some iced tea!

126
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,350
The sea!! Are you deaf?

127
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,419
What kind of a threat is that?
It doesn't make any sense!

128
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,587
Whatever!

129
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,422
All that matters is getting
the message to Straw Hat.

130
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,591
Giving him that stupid
message won't do any good!

131
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,093
And bro Franky will
end up kicking your butt!

132
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,795
"If you don't want him sunk
to the bottom of the sea,

133
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,563
go to the warehouse
under the bridge.

134
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:20,167
With regards, Franky"!
Like that!

135
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,136
If he gets the message
and he does come,

136
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,571
Bro is gonna beat the
living crap outta him!

137
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,310
Who did you say
is waiting for whom,

138
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:31,345
and where is this
certain someone waiting?

139
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,514
Huh? Who the hell are you?

140
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:36,283
We're kind of busy
right now. Get lost!

141
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,350
If you want to live,

142
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:40,588
you'll answer my question
in the next 3 seconds.

143
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:43,290
Huh?!

144
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,426
Is that some kinda'
joke, you nut-job?

145
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:47,428
Do you even have
the slightest clue

146
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:49,029
as to what family
we're a part of?

147
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:54,501
What did you mean by "the
warehouse under the bridge"?

148
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,270
Is that the place
where Franky is?

149
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:01,475
Whatever business
you have with Franky

150
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:05,412
is gonna have to go
through us first. Right guys?!

151
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,763
To think that you left the
friends you traveled here

152
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,532
with all the way from the
East Blue for your ship!

153
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:29,436
Why in the world are the
three of you crying about it?

154
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,805
What?! We're not
crying, you idiot!

155
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,341
I was just thinking about
everything you've been through

156
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,511
to protect that ship all
alone and it touched my heart!

157
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,215
We're not crying!
None of us are crying! Really!

158
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,650
What the heck is
wrong with these nitwits?

159
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,621
Anyway, you get
the gist of it, right?

160
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,256
We're no longer friends!

161
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,391
The Straw Hats are
part of my past now!

162
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:53,627
It's so sad.

163
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,063
So sad that I'll have
to sing about it!

164
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,500
This song is called, "Severed
Friendship! North Wind Chop!"

165
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:01,468
Yeah! Sing it, bro!

166
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,004
Hey! Are you
making fun of me!?

167
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:14,348
Is the tea ready yet?
I'm dying of thirst over here!

168
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:17,350
Almost! We'll bring it
over in just a moment!

169
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,589
That crying wore me out.
Not that I really cried.

170
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:30,263
Here you go, bro. Now be
careful, it's really hot!

171
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,435
Thank you so much!

172
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:37,704
Okay, I understand
what's what, brother.

173
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,241
Hot!!!

174
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,443
She just got through
telling you that! Calm down!

175
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,348
Sorry about that, bro. You okay?

176
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:50,250
Why don't you take a break
and have some tea, as well?

177
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,460
I can't blame you.

178
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:02,196
You must be holding
quite the grudge against us.

179
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:06,100
You know, since we stole your
200 million berries and all.

180
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,268
Especially because it led

181
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:10,070
to such a big fight
with your captain.

182
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:13,040
Whatever.
What happens, happens.

183
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:16,210
No sense in holding
a grudge about it.

184
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:22,650
Taking the high road.
How manly. About that money.

185
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:25,219
I spent all of it!

186
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,187
I'm gonna knock you flat.

187
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,757
Now, now.
Don't get so worked up!

188
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,525
Especially after you showed me

189
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:34,128
how dignified and
forgiving you are!

190
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:38,332
Come on, brother! Can't we
just let bygones be bygones?

191
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,301
I mean, I haven't
flipped out on you

192
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,671
for destroying my home and
demolition factory, have I?

193
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:47,408
And on top of that, you guys
annihilated my subordinates--

194
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,410
You bastards!
How dare you? I'll kill you!

195
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:50,377
Easy, bro!

196
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,279
You gotta control that anger!

197
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:08,162
Yep. A lot has happened
these past few days.

198
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,798
But I do think we're better
off putting it all behind us.

199
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,399
So what do you say
we just put the axe

200
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,335
in the ground
and call it a day?

201
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,170
I think you mean
"bury the hatchet."

202
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:19,340
Yeah. I'm pretty sure it's
"bury the hatchet," bro.

203
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,643
Yeah. What they said.

204
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:23,610
So what's next?

205
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:25,746
What will you do now
that you're on your own?

206
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:29,249
It doesn't seem like
you have anywhere to go.

207
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:31,519
Tell you what.

208
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,254
Why don't you let
me take care of you?

209
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:35,389
Join The Franky Family!

210
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,358
You seem like a good man,
and I could always--

211
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:41,395
Forget it! I have no plans
to become a ship dismantler.

212
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,631
Even though I'm no
longer a Straw Hat,

213
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:45,498
I'm still a pirate! Got it?

214
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,204
You've moved me to song.
This is "The Pirate Code."

215
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,206
Yeah! Sing it, bro!

216
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,442
Don't sing it, and I still
think you're making fun of me!

217
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,778
Look, I'm just
concerned, that's all.

218
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,214
I'm thinking about your future.

219
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,782
My future is none
of your business!

220
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:04,318
And besides, there
are other things

221
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,053
you should be concerned
with right now.

222
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,289
Like that huge
storm headed this way.

223
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:11,225
True. But we're safe here.

224
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,427
Aqua Laguna can
be pretty devastating.

225
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,629
When it hits, we all
have to pull together.

226
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,234
Starting now until
late into the night,

227
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,703
houses will be submerged
up to the second floor.

228
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:24,271
If you're stuck in
the backstreets

229
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,807
or capes during that time,
you don't stand a chance.

230
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,609
But this area's safe.

231
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:31,445
Your ship will be safe too,
if you wanna keep it here.

232
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:35,082
Oh. Thank you very much.
I really appreciate it.

233
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,217
Stop acting like
we're strangers, moron!

234
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,219
I imagine it must be
tough having to deal with

235
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,355
this storm and the chaos
it causes every year.

236
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:43,190
Nah. It's not so bad.

237
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:46,260
We've all gotten used
to the annual evacuation.

238
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,295
The real problem
is the water level.

239
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:52,232
It increases little by
little every single year.

240
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,802
The back streets you
see all through Water 7

241
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:57,171
are built on the
rooftops of an old town

242
00:18:57,204 --> 00:19:00,274
that existed several
hundred years ago.

243
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,343
It's said that the
shipbuilding island

244
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,812
and the backstreets used to be
part of the same piece of land.

245
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:07,748
But now, so much of it
has sunk under the sea.

246
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:10,451
That's why they call
it a "floating city."

247
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:13,621
All of the sidewalks
became canals and waterways.

248
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,623
If you want to be
more precise about it:

249
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:16,791
Technically,

250
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:17,892
rather than saying that the
water level is increasing,

251
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:20,294
the foundation of the
island is actually sinking.

252
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,629
If it keeps up,

253
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:24,598
the city will become harder
and harder to live in.

254
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:28,269
I see. Even this
beautiful city of water has

255
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:31,071
its share of hardships
too, doesn't it?

256
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:34,241
Hmm... But still.
If push comes to shove,

257
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:35,376
you can just take the Sea Train

258
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:37,344
and go live
somewhere else, right?

259
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:41,115
You can say that now.
But not always.

260
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:43,250
It's only been
around for ten years.

261
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,753
Before that time, you
were totally out of luck.

262
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:48,355
Getting across the ocean
without it is no easy task,

263
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,390
even if you have a boat.

264
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,326
This island is isolated.

265
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,096
There was never much
traffic to or from it.

266
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,565
The people who lived here
carried with them the looming

267
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:01,569
fear that someday this entire
city and everything around it

268
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:05,038
would sink into the sea.
They became hopeless.

269
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,752
The one thing that
finally took away

270
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:22,356
that fear was the
Sea Train, The Puffing Tom.

271
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,658
Now, anyone at
any time can travel

272
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,527
across the sea
without a Log Pose.

273
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,463
This was a huge
step for the island!

274
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:33,400
Wow, I had no idea. That
Sea Train is really incredible.

275
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,202
What a wonderful invention!

276
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,471
It was like Water 7
had been reborn.

277
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:40,441
And we owe
everything to one man.

278
00:20:40,474 --> 00:20:44,545
A brilliant shipwright named
Tom who created that Sea Train.

279
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:49,082
He saved us all.
And gave this island new life.

280
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,259
Bro!

281
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,497
Help me.

282
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:13,039
I'll say hello to your "bro"
for you when we pay him a visit.

283
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,619
We now know the location.

284
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,424
Let's go.

285
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:14,662
Hey, Long Nose!

286
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:15,863
What are you gonna do
after you fix your ship?

287
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:19,366
That's obvious! I'm gonna go
on adventures! She's gonna--

288
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,535
Sorry! Not possible! You can't!

289
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,602
What'd you say?

290
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:24,538
That ship won't even
make it to the next island.

291
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,675
Oh well, I'll just help you
dismantle it instead. Ready?

292
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,110
Stop it! What are you doing?!

293
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:31,445
On the next One Piece:

294
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:34,048
"The Man Who Is
Loved Even By His Ship!

295
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:37,717
Usopp's Tears!" I'm gonna
be King of the Pirates!
