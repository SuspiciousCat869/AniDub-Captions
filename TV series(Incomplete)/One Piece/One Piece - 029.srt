bring him to his knees,

356
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:39,344

[GHIN] To hell with
loyalty to Don Krieg.

360
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,954
My devotion to him

361
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,691
was just an escape from
forging my own destiny.

362
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,427
Once you heart is set,

363
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,229
and you pursue all your dreams

Give him the boat we use
to go grocery shopping!

C'mon! Are you
stupid or somethin'?!

370
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,483
Why do we have to give
a perfectly good boat

371
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,785
to a bunch of pirates?

372
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,322
And what's gonna happen to all
our grocery shopping, Jackass?

373

Patty's right. Let 'em swim
wherever they're goin' to!

374
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:30,829

Why did I hesitate?

What was I so worried about?

no need to return it?

It's yours.

391

Not for anything.

Well...
