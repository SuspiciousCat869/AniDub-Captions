the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.448
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.385
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.653
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.656
[NARRATOR] Now, those who
dare to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.493

Great Pirate Era!

for the treasure One Piece

must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:42.428
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:45.498
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.133
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.837
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

[NARRATOR]
Two years have passed

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.581
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:05.451
Luffy and his crew reunite to
continue on to the New World.

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.720
Their first stop
is Fishman Island,

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:10.990
where they encounter King
Neptune, merman royalty,

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.193
and conniving pirates alike.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.195
Soon, Luffy leaves
on an adventure

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:16.829
with the Mermaid Princess,

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.566

Look at that cloud!
It's so cute!

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:40.119
Huh?

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:41.988
[SHIRAHOSHI] I've only read
about them in books, of course,

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:45.358
but doesn't it look
just like raccoon?

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:50.763
[LUFFY] Oh, yeah! That's funny!
It's totally Chopper!

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.232
Who's Chopper?

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:54.601
A friend. Part of my crew.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:55.902
He's a doctor.

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.637
I'm confused.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.141
Are those giant flying fish?

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.412
[LUFFY] Darn it. They're
too far away to tell.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:09.582
Is something wrong?
I can't see from in here.

[FISHBOY 535A]
Mom, what are those weird fish?

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:27.200
Whoa! Look at that!

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.068
That's not normal.

[FISHMAN 535B] Ryugu Palace!
Ryugu Palace! Come in!

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:40.713
This is border control.
Come in. Can anyone hear me?

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:43.149
Hello? Hello?

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:44.584
I wonder what's wrong. Huh.

Click.

I'm still not getting
anything at all.

You think the snail's sick?

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:53.226
There's no immediate
call for alarm,

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.061
but it does seem like
there are a lot of people

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:56.896
coming in from the
Fishman District.

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:58.197
It worries me.

00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:01.100
That many wouldn't come at
one time just for shopping.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.836
They're dangerous people.
Anything could happen.

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:27.694
Today is the day.

All of Fishman Island will
be united under one flag!

Mermaids, mermen and fishmen
must all come together.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:38.371
We must all be of the same mind!

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:40.606
We've tolerated
humans long enough.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.177
Land-dwellers are inferior!
We will rule them.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.446
Or they will die!

of our engagement

But it's no rush.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.068
We don't have to
get married today.

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:10.603
I'll wait until tomorrow.

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:14.307
Seems the Sun Pirates and Jimbei
have decided not to join us.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.310
Annoying, but it isn't
exactly unexpected.

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:18.778
[ZEO] We take down Neptune.

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:21.781
We take down Fukaboshi,
Ryuboshi, Mamboshi,

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.783
then we're done.

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:25.985
Then his army-hii will fall,

surrender first.

one area, and move on.

You and your crewmates are
suspects in two investigations!

First off, we have
a missing person case.

Mermaids that your crew
had recent contact with.

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:39.091
Second, a powerful
psychic has named you

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.494
as a risk to the
safety of our island.

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:43.996
We can't afford
to take any chances.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.300
So we're arresting your crew!

I'm sorry, but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.372
So you're here
because of a psychic?

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:56.476
That doesn't sound very
scientific or sensible.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:57.910
I'm disappointed your culture

in such nonsense.

It seems my theory was correct.

There's a Poneglyph
hidden here somewhere.

care of themselves.

00:12:25.444 --> 00:12:27.847
I wonder if he came across
the Mermaid Princess.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.482
I'd still quite
like to meet her.

00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:31.317
[ALL scream]

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.653
[NEPTUNE]
My poor little girl! You fiends!

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:36.589
What have you done to her? Why?

00:12:36.622 --> 00:12:37.957
Stop crying!

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.358
I know we tied up your guards,

00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:41.360
but we didn't lay a
finger on your daughter!

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:44.930
[NEPTUNE] Liar! Straw Hat
Luffy took her away!

00:12:44.964 --> 00:12:46.031
My sweet princess!

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:48.300
[BROOK] I can assure you
that's not the case.

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:50.903
I only saw Luffy and
Mister Shark leave the room.

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:52.171
Surely I would have noticed

00:12:52.204 --> 00:12:54.373
if they had a mermaid
princess with them.

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:56.375
[NEPTUNE] If you knew her,
you would understand.

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:58.878
She would never sneak
out on her own.

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:02.181
Also, someone would notice if
she simply swam out of the room.

00:13:02.214 --> 00:13:04.950
She takes after me
when it comes to size.

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:08.154
[gasps] Your daughter's
as big as you?

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:11.657
Jamon! Hooray!

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.292
[BROOK]
No thank you.

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:15.294
[NEPTUNE]
Why didn't I realize it sooner?

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:18.330
Straw Hat hid Shirahoshi
inside Megalo's mouth

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:20.900
and they all left
the palace together!

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:24.270
[FISHMEN laugh]

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:25.271
Come on, your highness,

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:27.239
you shouldn't joke
at a time like this.

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:28.440
That's crazy!

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:30.743
I know Straw Hat
has a wild reputation,

00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:33.179
but that's pretty far
out there, even for him.

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:37.616
Ah... Ah-choo!

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:45.791
Dang it, shark, you've
got me sneezing now.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.460
Sharks make you sneeze?
I didn't know that.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.662
They don't, but sometimes

00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:52.398
I sneeze outta
nowhere. Wonder why.

00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:13.219
[NEPTUNE]
Come back, Shirahoshi!

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:14.320
That's enough!

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:17.223
Luffy may be a pirate,
but he's not a kidnapper.

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:19.325
There has to be another
culprit out there.

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:21.260
[NEPTUNE] You can't talk
your way out of this one!

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:23.996
If my little girl
doesn't come back safe,

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.598
then I'm keeping your ship!

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:28.767
And I'll be keeping
your friends in jail!

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:32.071
[NAMI] No fair! We're
victims here, too!

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:40.813
I... I did it.

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:48.621
Looks like they
finished their job.

00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:51.257
Not bad for a bunch of humans.

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.934
[FRANKY yells]

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:03.936
[FRANKY]
Hey, Sunny ! Lookin' good!

00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:05.471
Things got pretty
wild back there,

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:09.541
but you can't keep
a super ship down!

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.544
[DEN] As you can see,
others weren't so lucky.

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:15.581
The tide brings many sunken
vessels to this spot.

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:17.650
It's almost like a
graveyard for ships

00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:19.818
that couldn't reach
the New World.

00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:23.088
And yet, this is a place
overflowing with life.

00:15:23.122 --> 00:15:25.658
Thanks to the grace
of the Sun Tree Eve,

00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:28.661
many colorful fish and coral
make their home here.

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:30.162
[FRANKY]
And whales, too, huh?

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:32.898
I don't think I've ever seen
so many in one place before.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.668
Some of 'em are even
bigger than the Sunny !

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:38.337
[DEN] Even if they're tucked
away in deep waters,

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.740
whales always know
where fertile seas lie.

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:46.211
[FRANKY] Whoa. This place
is a real wonderland.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.416
[DEN]
It's endlessly fascinating.

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:51.784
No matter how much I observe,

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:54.586
there's always
something new to find.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.555
[FRANKY]
So it's not just me.

00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:57.856
Even the people
who live down here

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.758
think this place is a miracle.

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.494
All of Fishman Island, I mean.

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:04.029
[DEN chuckles]

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:07.666
[DEN] I don't know how you got
wood from the tree of Adam,

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.602
but this is a fine ship,
worthy of its parts.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:13.038
[FRANKY] Damn straight!
This is my masterpiece!

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:16.075
Tom made a ship outta the
same stuff for Gold Roger.

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:18.811
So nothin' less'll do
for my captain!

00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:22.514
[DEN chuckles] I'll do
the ship coating for you.

00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:25.484
And I'll do it with gusto.

00:16:25.517 --> 00:16:27.553
[FRANKY] Haven't heard
that one in a while.

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:30.522
Oh, uh, sorry, I never
caught your name.

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:31.890
Call me Den.

00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:34.860
[FRANKY] So, Den, don't
take this the wrong way,

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:38.063
but for bein' his brother, you
sure don't look much like Tom.

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:40.733
I mean, you're a merman
and he was a fishman.

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:42.634
Was one of you
adopted or somethin'?

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:47.406
[laughs] That's a
human-centric way to think.

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:49.708
I can hardly blame you,
since family members

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:52.578
tend to look so much
alike on the surface.

00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:55.180
It works a bit
differently with us.

00:16:55.214 --> 00:16:57.182
We carry genes
from our ancestors

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:59.051
that can show up
in different ways.

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:02.287
And this rule applies to
both merfolk and fishmen.

00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:06.291
So, if an octopus mermaid
gives birth to a shark merman,

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:07.659
that's normal.

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.962
It just means that she,
or the father,

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:12.931
has shark merman somewhere
in their lineage.

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:16.502
The bottom line is
nothing really surprises us.

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:19.705
No matter what way
our children turn out.

00:17:19.738 --> 00:17:21.407
That's why it doesn't
make much sense to us

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.208
when humans discriminate
against someone

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:25.577
just because they
look a certain way.

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:27.146
See, the way you look

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:29.748
doesn't say a thing
about who you are.

00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:31.283
[FRANKY chuckles]

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:33.752
Speakin' of which,

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:36.455
was one of your ancestors
a robot, perhaps?

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:38.290
[FRANKY]
That's not how it works, bro.

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:40.926
My mistake. You're human.

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:42.795
So one of your
parents was a robot?

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:44.096
[FRANKY]
How does that make sense?

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:45.864
Heh. You tell me!

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:48.100
[FRANKY]
It was a rhetorical question!

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:51.403
I should've said, I got
a letter from Granny Kokoro.

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:53.906
So, I heard all
about you and Iceberg.

00:17:53.939 --> 00:17:56.108
[FRANKY] You and the
old bag stay in touch?

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:57.609
That's nice.

00:17:57.643 --> 00:18:00.479
Now that is one face
I never thought I'd miss.

00:18:00.512 --> 00:18:02.714
[DEN] At any rate,
I heard the whole story.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:05.084
The good and the bad.

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:06.752
I know that my brother died

00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:08.654
the very same way he lived.

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:10.389
With gusto!

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:11.356
Well, either way,

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.926
I do appreciate you
comin' here to tell me.

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:16.395
It seems he chose
his students well.

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:18.597
[FRANKY giggles]

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.667
Aw, you're flattering me!

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.869
[DEN]
Are you sure you're not a robot?

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:26.738
Uh, well, it's complicated.

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:28.207
Let's drop it, okay?

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.542
By the way, I've been
meanin' to ask ya.

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:32.678
There's a dude sitting
all alone over there.

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:35.180
Do you know who he is?

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:38.450
Uh-huh! That would
be the Boss, Jimbei.

00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:40.786
Huh? Boss of what?

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:43.055
[DEN] Consider it a
term of endearment.

00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:45.557
He's waiting for someone,
but he doesn't wanna

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:49.094
enter the island
because he's a wanted man.

00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:07.212
[FISHMAN 535A yells]
Intruder alert!

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:08.747
But, the front gate.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.183
How did you scoundrels
get in here?

00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:14.520
[DECKEN]
Well, isn't this convenient!

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:17.389
I was ready for a fight,
but everyone's tied up!

00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:20.492
I didn't expect much from
those pirates we sent.

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:24.363
Don't tell me they're
the ones who did this.

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:25.564
It doesn't matter.

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:26.932
When someone leaves
you a present,

00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:29.268
you don't ask questions.

00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:31.236
Heh. They look scared.

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:36.108
I know you!

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:38.110
What's he doing here?

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:39.344
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
We've fought so hard

00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:43.282
to keep Vander Decken away
and now he waltzes right in!

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:45.317
And is that who I think it is?

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:51.190
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT] Hordy
Jones from the Fishman District?

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:54.026
What does he want?
This can't be good.

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:57.029
[NEPTUNE]
Hordy. I know that name.

00:19:58.597 --> 00:20:00.299
He once served us.

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:04.203
That is, he was a decorated
soldier in the royal army.

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:13.045
Actually, on second thought...

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:15.247
Are you setting a trap for us?

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.483
[ZORO] Had an awful lot
of visitors today, huh?

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:20.285
Ugh.

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:22.287
They're not like the last batch.

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:25.257
You did this! You
must be accomplices!

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.726
Just admit it: you let
them into the palace!

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.728
Oh, really? It's our fault?

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:32.130
You realize we wouldn't even
be here in the first place

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:33.932
if your king
hadn't invited us!

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:36.702
I don't know those guys!
I don't want to!

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.036
They're scary!

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.672
Hey! You gotta give
our weapons back!

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:43.542
This is bad! We're gonna
need to fight them!

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:45.043
[NEPTUNE]
Vander Decken!

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:49.348
So you're the one behind this!
Straw Hat was innocent.

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:50.916
Give me back my daughter!

00:20:50.949 --> 00:20:52.918
You've made her suffer enough!

00:20:52.951 --> 00:20:56.388
[laughs] All
father-in-laws say that,

00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:59.324
but you'll come around by the
time our honeymoon is over.

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:00.959
This I suspect!

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:03.228
[NEPTUNE] I'll never
be your father-in-law!

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.063
Now where did you
take Shirahoshi?

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:07.065
If you harmed one
hair on her head--

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:09.601
You're losing your
mind, old man.

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:12.938
If I already had her, why would
I bother breaking in here?

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:14.706
[NEPTUNE]
Don't play dumb with me!

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.575
You're here and my
daughter is missing!

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:18.343
The situation is clear!

00:21:18.377 --> 00:21:20.746
[DECKEN]
Someone took my Shirahoshi?!

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:23.715
[screams] This is a tragedy!

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:25.350
[NEPTUNE]
She's not yours!

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:27.119
And damn right, it's a tragedy!

00:21:27.152 --> 00:21:29.021
Calm down, your highness.

00:21:29.054 --> 00:21:31.923
This is going nowhere and
we need answers, quickly!

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:33.759
[NEPTUNE growls]

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.095
[NEPTUNE, DECKEN]
Hm?

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:39.865
Enough screaming. It's a bluff.

00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:41.066
See this?

00:21:41.099 --> 00:21:44.002
All the pirates you threw
at her are here in the palace.

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:46.271
That means she must be close.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.240
Even if Neptune
is telling the truth

00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:51.043
and she's gone, she
couldn't have gotten far.

00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:52.778
Somebody, help me!

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:55.113
[HORDY]
Besides, one little toss

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:57.282
and you can track
her down anywhere.

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.918
Don't tell me love
has made you so blind

00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:02.688
that you forgot how
to use your own power.

00:22:06.058 --> 00:22:08.093
His power? What's that?

00:22:08.126 --> 00:22:10.495
Good idea! You know, Hordy.

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:11.663
For a musclehead,

00:22:11.697 --> 00:22:14.733
you're really pretty clever
when it comes down to it!

00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:16.935
Huh? Now he's leaving?

00:22:16.968 --> 00:22:19.471
I have a real bad
feeling about this.

00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:27.212
[DECKEN]
All right, Mr. Coral,

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:30.248
find my princess for me!

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:36.321
Oh! It is flying away!

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:41.660
[yells] We've been
in love for ten years!

00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:44.196
Nothing can tear
us apart, Princess!

00:22:44.229 --> 00:22:46.765
Except death, that is!

00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:50.402
And then, I had
a real big fart!

00:22:50.435 --> 00:22:52.771
[laughs]

00:22:52.804 --> 00:22:54.406
That is funny,

00:22:54.439 --> 00:22:56.708
but it's a bit
inappropriate, too.

00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:57.809
[LUFFY]
Oh, oops!

00:22:57.843 --> 00:22:59.111
[LUFFY, SHIRAHOSHI laugh]

00:22:59.144 --> 00:23:04.149
[laughs] If I can't have
you, then nobody can!

00:23:04.182 --> 00:23:08.787
You're about to be a big,
beautiful corpse, Shirahoshi!

00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:15.026
[NARRATOR]
As sea water pours through

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.630
the palace's broken wall,
Hordy attacks Neptune's army.

00:23:18.663 --> 00:23:21.166
Neptune risks his life
to protect his soldiers

00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:22.868
but cannot triumph in battle.

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.936
Just when things are
starting to look grim,

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.239
Zoro challenges Hordy himself.

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:29.875
However, with the sea water
continuing to rise,

00:23:29.908 --> 00:23:33.078
the swordsman is forced to
battle the Fishman underwater.

00:23:33.111 --> 00:23:34.746
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.283
"The Battle of the Ryugu
Palace! Zoro vs. Hordy!"

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:40.685
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
