are still doctors...

176
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,046
Even though we were
forced against our wills

177
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,781
to serve only Wapol...

178
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,118
We've always worked to advance
our medical research...

179
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,188
For the benefit of all
the patients in this country!

180
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,857
[VILLAGERS murmuring]

181
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,292
It was all because of a...

182
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,462
...certain quack who
taught us to never to give up.

183
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:54,200
[DOCTOR A] We can't afford to
lose any more men like him...

184
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,536
So please, let us help!

185
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,239
[CHOPPER] The effect of the
Rumble Ball lasts three minutes.

186
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,808
All the time I need
to take you down!

187
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:03,809
[CHESSMARIMO]
Three minutes!

188
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,244
Ha‐ha! You couldn't defeat me

189
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,147
in three years,
let alone three minutes!

190
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,650
Just three? Amazing!

191
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,152
Just three? No way.

192
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:18,291
Well, all right, this should
be an interesting battle.

193
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,561
C'mon, you old bat!
Let me up so I can help!

194
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,795
[CHOPPER]
Rumble!

195
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,732
[CHESSMARIMO]
You're no match!

196
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,568
Not against this!

197
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,175
Marimo's Snow Melting Arrow!

198
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,180
[CHOPPER]
Walk Point! Leg Boost!

199
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,919
[CHESSMARIMO]
Hmph! Just a transformation, eh?

200
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,621
I was expecting something more!

201
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:51,023
All you have to show
are devil fruit powers?

202
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,992
You're a Zoan type,
just like Dalton!

203
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,828
So you're a reindeer human, huh?

204
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,030
[CHOPPER]
Heavy Point! Weight Boost!

205
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,167
[CHOPPER]
No! I'm a human reindeer!

206
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,168
Same thing!

207
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,269
And I know everything
there is to know about

208
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:07,206
the three‐form transformations
you Zoan‐types use!

209
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,543
Marimo's Big Super
Surprise Quattro Hammer!

210
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,345
Speaking of surprises,

211
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,347
you've got none left
to spring on me!

212
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,448
I've seen all your forms now!

213
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,317
You're nothing more than
a power fighter like Dalton!

214
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,986
So there's no way you can...

215
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:20,987
Jumping Point!

216
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,288
Jump Boost!

217
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,858
[CHESSMARIMO]
...get the jump on me, freak!

218
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,732
[SANJI]
Jeez! That guy can really jump!

219
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,734
[LUFFY laughs]

220
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,202
[CHESSMARIMO]
What the‐‐?! I don't get it!

221
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,303
What is that form?!

222
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,339
Wasn't his "human‐animal form"

223
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,709
the little reindeer
from earlier?! What now?!

224
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,811
[CHOPPER]
Guard Point! Fur Boost!

225
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,760
Another form?!

226
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,229
[LUFFY]
Whoa! Awesome!

227
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,102
[CHESSMARIMO]
No way! I hit you dead on!

228
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,204
[CHOPPER]
It won't work!

229
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,439
How is this possible?!

230
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,743
You Zoan‐types have a three form
limit! What the heck are you?!

231
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,779
The Rumble Ball
is a special pill that enhances

232
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,248
the power of the Devil Fruit's
transformations...

233
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,717
Over five long years of
research, I discovered

234
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,686
four additional
transformation points...

235
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,288
Do the rest of the math
yourself, you jerk!

236
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,058
A‐A seven‐form transformation?!

237
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,759
[gasps]

238
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,894
[CHESSMARIMO]
That's impossible!

239
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,128
I don't believe it!

240
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:41,100
[gasps] A talking reindeer who
can change into seven forms?!

241
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,102
Your friend,
what's the matter with him?

242
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,737
[SANJI] There's just so much
happiness of meeting

243
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,972
a transforming reindeer
a guy can take.

244
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,307
[WAPOL]
You bastard...

245
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:52,978
Did you forget
about fighting me?!

246
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,431
[CHESSMARIMO] A seven‐form
transformation is impossible!

247
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,599
I won't be deceived by what

248
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,001
has to be an obvious sham!

249
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,169
It's not one!

250
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,839
[laughs]

251
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,146
[CHOPPER]
Arm Point! Arm Boost!

252
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,817
[CHESSMARIMO grunts]

253
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:44,997
[CHESSMARIMO]
Huh?!

254
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,298
[CHOPPER]
Could a sham do that?!

255
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,033
If you thought that was
something, you should see

256
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,870
what my iron hooves
can do against rocks!

257
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,439
Whoa...

258
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,108
Not my hammers! What nerve!

259
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,513
[CHESSMARIMO]
These'll teach you!

260
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,449

Surprise Quattro Axe!

261
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,017
[CHOPPER]
Hm.

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,119

[CHOPPER groans]

264
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,359
Wow! Damn!

265
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,628
That reindeer can
really take a hit.

268
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,634
Damn! You dodged it!

269
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,570
Let's see you dodge... this!

270
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,240
[CHESSMARIMO]
Omnidirectional Snow Splitter!

271
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,385
[LUFFY growls]

272
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,253
You're gonna take me down, huh?!

273
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,656
You're not fighting;
you're just dodging!

274
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,100
Brain Point! Brain Boost!

275
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,404
[CHOPPER] I wasn't just
dodging your swings!

276
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,108
[CHOPPER] I was looking
for your weak spot!

277
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,276
[CHESSMARIMO]
What?!

278
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,445
[CHOPPER]
This'll finish you! Scope!

279
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:17,089
A... A beam!
He's gonna shot a beam!

280
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,457
[SANJI]
No, he won't, you idiot!

281
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,192
[LUFFY]
Hey, you, shut your trap!

282
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,961
I'm telling you,
it's gotta be a beam!

283
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:22,962
[SANJI]
How do you know that?!

284
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,129
Huh, Mr. Smart Guy?!

285
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,197
[LUFFY]
I just do!

286
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,366
[SANJI]
Fine! What kind of beam?!

287
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,301
[WAPOL]
The castle's unguarded...

288
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,136
[CHESSMARIMO]
Looking for my weak spot, huh?

289
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,705
Well, I've got
some news for you!

290
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,480
I don't have one!

291
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,283
Your little transforming parlor
tricks can't save you now!

292
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,318
And as you're about to find out,
you're the one who's

293
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,053
goin' to be finished!

294
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,590
[CHOPPER]
Found it!

295
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,159
[CHOPPER]
His jaw!

296
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,494
[CHESSMARIMO]
Yah!

297
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,177
[CHESSMARIMO]
Huh?

298
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,479
Where'd he go?!

299
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,182
[CHOPPER]
Hoofprint...

300
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,658
[whimpers]

301
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,694
[CHOPPER]
...Roseo!

302
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,363
[groans]

303
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,444
[CHOPPER]
Ah. Three minutes.

304
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,713
Yeah! All right!

305
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,215
Wow! You were
incredible, reindeer!

306
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,784
No, you were more than that!

307
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,452
‐‐You were amazing!
‐‐Shut up!

308
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,722
[LUFFY laughs]

309
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,198
[DALTON groans]

310
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,635
‐‐Dalton... He's awake!
‐‐Are you okay?! It's a miracle!

311
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,072
[VIVI]
I can't take this anymore!

312
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,407
Let's go up the mountain!
Okay, Usopp?!

313
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,542
‐‐Mr. Bushido?!
‐‐[ZORO] Huh?

314
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,744
[VIVI] This sitting around and
waiting is killing me!

315
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,146
Luffy and the others could've
gotten hurt in that avalanche!

316
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,381
They might be trapped!

317
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,150
And don't forget,
Nami had a high fever!

318
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,385
If anything's
happened to them...

319
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,420
[USOPP]
You're worried about Nami...

320
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,589
And Luffy and Sanji
and Dalton...

321
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,058
...and what's going
on in Alabasta.

322
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,262
Vivi... Can't you see it?

323
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,198
You're carrying too many
burdens on your shoulders!

324
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,432
Calm down!

325
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,702
We don't need
to go up there at all,

326
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,338
and do ya know why?
Because those three are fine!

327
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,108
And that's Luffy and Nami
and Sanji we're talking about!

328
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,342
I believe in them!

329
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,445
[VIVI]
That's right... He's right...

330
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,250
[VIVI] You have to
have faith in your friends.

331
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,253
Usopp does and that's
why he can be so calm...

332
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,122
I get it now.

333
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,624
Thanks a lot...
You're full of wisdom, Usopp.

334
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:06,792
[ZORO]
No, he's full of crap!

335
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,627
He's just afraid to
go up that mountain!

336
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,562
[USOPP] But I heard that
there were things like yetis

337
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,297
and huge, man‐eating
bunnies up there!

338
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,465
I don't wanna get eaten!

339
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,567
Then say so from
the start, coward!

340
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,137
[USOPP] Okay! I don't
wanna be some monster's snack!

341
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,640
And I'm sure they're fine!
Luffy can work out anything!

342
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,641
[VILLAGER D]
Dalton, no!

343
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,443
[VILLAGER E]
Wait!

344
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,478
[DALTON groans]

345
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,247
Hey! It's Dalton!

346
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,314
Thank goodness!

347
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:32,718
Would somebody please
tell me who this guy is?!

348
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,320
[VILLAGER D]
Dalton! Listen to reason!

349
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,455
Get out of my way!

350
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:40,292
We can't let Wapol retake
the castle! We just can't!

351
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,660
Wait! You mean that's
where you're heading?

352
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,461
The castle?

353
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,431
In your condition?!
Are you nuts?!

354
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,467
My country is far
more important than my health!

355
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,836
He can not succeed!
I will not let that happen!

356
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,572
Not now, not ever!
Wapol must perish!

357
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,507
[gasping]

358
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,341
But you're not strong enough

359
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,277
to fight them in
your condition, sir!

360
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,312
[VILLAGER D] And the rest of us
are no match for them, either!

361
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,613
[DALTON grunts]

362
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,183
I'm going to settle this
thing once and for all!

363
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,485
I'll stop Wapol
even if it kills me!

364
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,257
[DALTON groans]

365
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,671
Here. I'll take you
to the castle... Hop on.

366
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,272
[gasps]

367
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,608
Come on now,
don't be so modest...

368
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:30,943
I just want you to
save your strength for

369
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,377
the fight, that's all.

370
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,879
How considerate...

371
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,384
[USOPP groans] Just hold
tight... 'Kay, here goes...

372
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,187
[groaning]
We'll be there in no time...

373
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,725
Usopp meant well...

374
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:50,329
[VILLAGERS murmuring]

375
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,333
Um, Usopp, thanks,
but, uh... this isn't working.

376
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,869
Just give me a second! Okay?!

377
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,470
I haven't quite
hit my stride yet!

378
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,638
Besides...

379
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,007
I told ya I was gonna get
ya to the castle and I will!

380
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,408
Now that I caught
my breath here,

381
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,744
we can get back
on our merry way!

382
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:11,817
[ZORO groans] Dammit...
What the hell's he doing?!

383
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,352
[USOPP gasps]

384
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,520
You just gonna
sit there and whine,

385
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,522
or are you coming with us?

386
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:20,859
[USOPP whimpers]
Zoro! [whines]

387
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,427
You stupid jerk!

388
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,729
‐‐You thunder‐stealer!
‐‐[ZORO] Hey! Stop it!

389
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,264
‐‐Gonna knock your lights out!
‐‐Knock it off!

390
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,598
[wails]

391
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,401
[USOPP]
Why did you do that?!

392
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,869
And just as I was gettin'
my second wind, too!

393
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,939
‐‐Uh‐huh... Sure you were...
‐‐I was... No, I was...

394
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,608
‐‐Of ourse you were...
‐‐I'm gonna kick your...

395
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,910
Hey, wait! Hold up!

396
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,445
There's an easier
way up to the castle!

397
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,713
[USOPP]
Huh?

398
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,949
Instead of walking,
take the ropeway.

399
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,217
Ropeway? Impossible...

400
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,587
There hasn't been one connecting
to Wapol's castle for awhile.

401
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,622
Someone's obviously
reconnected one

402
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,723
because I just saw it.

403
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,792
There was a rope leading
from the castle to a big,

404
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,461
white tree on the
outskirts of Gyasta.

405
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,729
Gyasta, huh?!

406
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,398
That's the name of
the town that Dr. Kureha

407
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:03,135
was headed to! Remember?!

408
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,537
[SANJI]
Hey, Luffy!

409
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,538
[LUFFY]
Yeah?

410
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,539
[SANJI]
Where is he?

411
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:08,941
[LUFFY]
Where's who?

412
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,576
[SANJI]
That guy!

413
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,577
That guy who?

414
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,812
[SANJI] That tin‐plated
bastard! He's not here!

415
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,215
[yells]

416
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,485
Well, since his hippo
got knocked away,

417
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:23,488
I doubt he could've
snuck off very far.

418
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,591
Yeah, but how?! When'd he go?!

419
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,660
Probably when you were drooling
over those transformations!

420
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,730
How sneaky! I'll find him!

421
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,832
Where do you think
he ran off to?

422
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,269
[SANJI] Hm. There's not much up
here, just the castle...

423
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,971
And Nami's all alone in there!

424
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,306
[LUFFY yells]

425
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,975
[SANJI] If he lays a finger
on her, I'll chop him up

426
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,510
‐‐and feed 'em to the sharks!
‐‐[KUREHA] Hold it!

427
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,479
[sighs]
Oh, well...

428
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,349
I guess the nincompoop
has a death wish.

429
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,650
[CHOPPER]
Doctorine?

430
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,685
[KUREHA]
Hm?

431
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,622
That guy... Did you hear him?

432
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,191
[KUREHA chuckles]

433
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,326
[CHOPPER]
He called me his friend.

434
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,336
[yells]

435
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,537
[LUFFY]
Hey, big mouth!

436
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,873
When I find ya,
I'm gonna kick your butt!

437
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,344
Seems like my fever's
gone down quite a bit.

438
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,879
That means I should
be able to get back to

439
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,215
the ship after
a little more rest.

440
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,486
[NAMI]
Wait! What am I saying?!

441
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,987
I can't just lay
around in bed like this

442
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,291
because Vivi's waiting...
to go home!

443
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,664
What?! I go away
and this is what happens?!

444
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,633
Drum Castle used to
be a stately palace!

445
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,671
Now it's nothing but a run‐down
hovel filled with snow!

446
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,839
What did they do to it?!

447
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,676
Oh, I won't let
them get away with this!

448
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,843
[growls]

449
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,980
I'll chew them up until there's
absolutely nothing left!
