00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:37.582
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.487
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:45.732
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.303
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.543
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.446
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.952
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.791
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:03.266
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.803
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.837 --> 00:03:08.577
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:12.885
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.359
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:18.229
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.262 --> 00:03:20.501
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.906
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.511
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:28.551
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the entire kingdom inside

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:31.389
a powerful barrier
known as the "Birdcage."

00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:33.393
Amidst the chaos,
he also put prices

00:03:33.426 --> 00:03:35.865
on the heads of Luffy
and his allies.

00:03:35.898 --> 00:03:38.804
As the Don Quixote Family
tightens its defenses,

00:03:38.837 --> 00:03:42.779
Luffy makes a mad dash to the
palace to defeat Doflamingo.

00:03:44.983 --> 00:03:47.420
[LAW]
His name was Corazon.

00:03:47.454 --> 00:03:50.561
He was a former top executive
in the Don Quixote Family.

00:03:50.594 --> 00:03:53.767
[LUFFY gasps]
Mingo killed his own friend?

00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:57.274
Corazon was the man
who saved my life.

00:03:57.308 --> 00:03:59.311
But to Doflamingo,
he was more than a member

00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:01.149
of the Don Quixote Family.

00:04:01.182 --> 00:04:03.654
He was his younger brother.

00:04:03.687 --> 00:04:07.662
Viola, wait. Why place
your faith in them?

00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:08.865
They're criminals.

00:04:08.898 --> 00:04:10.067
That's fine.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.641
Our kingdom must be broken
down and its lies exposed.

00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:14.909
They'll do that.

00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:18.785
I trust them. That's why, I...

00:04:18.818 --> 00:04:21.222
I'm betting everything
on the Straw Hats.

00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:22.626
Please believe me.

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.631
The Usolanders, or rather,
the Straw Hats,

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:28.770
are the greatest hope
that Dressrosa's got!

00:04:29.573 --> 00:04:30.942
Even though they're pirates,

00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:34.883
I'll trust them and cheer
them on 'til the very end!

00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:42.164
[JEET] This is it, Straw Hat!
We're about to reach the bottom!

00:04:42.197 --> 00:04:44.101
Yeah, we're the
first ones to make it!

00:04:44.134 --> 00:04:46.606
We get dibs on beating up Mingo!

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.321
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum... Fire Salute!

00:04:57.027 --> 00:04:59.298
Okay! Now pick up the pace!

00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:00.869
Are you ready?

00:05:00.902 --> 00:05:02.204
[BULL moos]

00:05:02.238 --> 00:05:05.009
[LUFFY]
Let's go!

00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:10.187
[LUFFY]
"A Big Collision!

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.927
Chief of Staff
Sabo vs. Admiral Fujitora!"

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.964
[yells]

00:05:31.997 --> 00:05:32.932
[yells]

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:36.172
[ALL yell]

00:05:36.206 --> 00:05:38.911
[CHIN JAO]
Doflamingo!

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:45.023
[DELLINGER]
This is wrong! Ahh! Wrong!

00:05:47.127 --> 00:05:51.068
How did those muscle heads
make it this far, this fast?

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.489
[DELLINGER]
We were supposed to have

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:03.493
thousands of Marines down there!

00:06:03.527 --> 00:06:05.864
Maybe they're sleep-een.

00:06:08.638 --> 00:06:10.808
I could understand them
getting past the troops,

00:06:10.842 --> 00:06:14.616
but Bastille and Fujitora were
supposed to be there, too!

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.863
Are these guys crazy strong
and somehow we didn't know?

00:06:24.235 --> 00:06:26.472
Is that all they
have to stop us?

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:28.343
The Don Quixote Family is weak!

00:06:28.376 --> 00:06:33.153
We'll reach their boss
in no time! Yee Ow!

00:06:33.186 --> 00:06:35.791
I'm first! Get outta my way!

00:06:35.824 --> 00:06:37.327
[FARUL neighs]

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.899
Now, let's rise
with grace, Farul!

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:42.838
For this is the
stairway to stardom!

00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:46.580
[GLADIUS]
Stupid, useless Navy.

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:48.082
There's more coming.

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:49.218
Huh?

00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:51.155
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
I have a report!

00:06:51.188 --> 00:06:53.928
Straw Hat Luffy has arrived
at the base of the--

00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:55.565
[groans]

00:06:55.598 --> 00:07:01.142
All right, Gum-Gum... Gatling!

00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:03.113
Move it!

00:07:03.146 --> 00:07:04.682
[ALL groan]

00:07:07.454 --> 00:07:09.425
No one stands before Straw Hat!

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:12.598
Only an idiot would
dare get in his way!

00:07:12.631 --> 00:07:16.139
Huh? The idiots behind me
can hit the road, too!

00:07:16.172 --> 00:07:17.709
We know you don't mean that!

00:07:17.742 --> 00:07:20.247
C'mon, Straw Hat,
we're here to help you!

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.086
You're our buddy!

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:25.290
I'm stuck with them, aren't I?

00:07:25.323 --> 00:07:26.492
Die, Straw Hat!

00:07:26.526 --> 00:07:28.597
It's over!
Right here, right now!

00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:35.009
Gum-Gum... Stamp Gatling!

00:07:37.147 --> 00:07:41.488
[BOTH] Yeah! Now that's
what I'm talking about, buddy!

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:50.006
[LUFFY] I'm coming for you now,
Mingo! Watch out!

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:51.509
I'm sorry, sir.

00:07:51.543 --> 00:07:55.149
We-- We tried,
but he's too tough.

00:07:57.722 --> 00:07:59.024
[GLADIUS]
Straw Hat!

00:07:59.058 --> 00:08:01.863
Ahh! They are so done for!

00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:08.342
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES yelling]

00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:11.315
Uh, the coliseum
group is on its way.

00:08:11.348 --> 00:08:14.221
[FARUL neighs]

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:21.636
[CAVENDISH]
Ha!

00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:26.713
[chuckles]

00:08:27.447 --> 00:08:32.825

Destruction... Cannon!

00:08:40.273 --> 00:08:42.978
I'm coming! Hya!

00:08:45.684 --> 00:08:48.289
[MACHVISE] What are you
idiots do-een down there?

00:08:48.322 --> 00:08:52.565
We are supposed to be win-een
this game, not lose-een!

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:55.236
Can't stop one man,
you bunch of goons?

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:58.577
That's "goons" with a capital G!

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.119
It's looking grim,
with a capital G!

00:09:03.152 --> 00:09:08.195
Good luck, with a capital G!

00:09:08.229 --> 00:09:09.800
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE K]
He can keep saying "G,"

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:11.368
but it's not gonna help!

00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:14.208
We're no match for
those guys. Huh?

00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:16.345
[yells]

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:22.725
Ow! Hey, jerk!
Watch out! Meat head!

00:09:22.758 --> 00:09:25.396
One less weakling!
Why should I care?

00:09:25.429 --> 00:09:27.301
What was that?

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:28.671
[CAVENDISH]
<i>Au revoir!</i>

00:09:28.704 --> 00:09:30.908
You two can stand there
bickering all day,

00:09:30.941 --> 00:09:34.682
but I must repay my debt to
God Usopp and his friends!

00:09:34.715 --> 00:09:39.992
Also, I want to see my face
on tomorrow's newspapers!

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:44.802
Enjoy your little war--

00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:48.677
I'm sure that'll work out
just great for you! [laughs]

00:09:48.711 --> 00:09:50.681
Damn it! Bastard's right.

00:09:50.714 --> 00:09:53.219
We have a debt to repay, too!

00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:57.895
Ah! They're all getting closer!

00:09:57.929 --> 00:09:59.799
Those coliseum guys
are moving, too!

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:02.738
I can see that, Dellinger.

00:10:02.772 --> 00:10:05.912
It seems like there's something
holding up the Navy.

00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:07.748
[DELLINGER]
What is it?

00:10:14.795 --> 00:10:17.735
I don't suppose,
if I asked nicely,

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:20.239
you'd move out of my way?

00:10:28.456 --> 00:10:30.092
Prob'ly not.

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:36.038
[SABO] I stand with
the Straw Hat Pirates.

00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:39.344
And with those who have
risen up to join them.

00:10:39.377 --> 00:10:41.181
So if you, or any
of your friends,

00:10:41.215 --> 00:10:45.524
want to lay a finger on them,
you're not taking another step.

00:10:45.557 --> 00:10:47.193
Not on my watch.

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:04.227
Giving cover to pirates?

00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:07.535
Is that the
Revolutionary Army's job?

00:11:07.569 --> 00:11:08.938
[SABO]
It is now.

00:11:08.971 --> 00:11:12.277
And I think I can say that,
as chief of staff.

00:11:13.413 --> 00:11:15.951
Moreso. I say that...

00:11:18.456 --> 00:11:21.161
...as a brother. Ha.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:26.372
I see. Though that
begs the question of

00:11:26.405 --> 00:11:28.977
who your dear sibling might be.

00:11:37.795 --> 00:11:39.264
Don't bother.

00:11:39.297 --> 00:11:42.938
I know he's our enemy, but you'd
only be wasting ammunition.

00:11:47.047 --> 00:11:49.184
[MARINE C]
But Vice Admiral!

00:11:59.506 --> 00:12:01.441
Your leader's right.

00:12:03.112 --> 00:12:05.751
None of you stand a chance.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.227
Even if all of you
attacked me at once.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.263
I wouldn't feel a thing.

00:12:12.296 --> 00:12:13.967
Yeah, we'll see!

00:12:20.547 --> 00:12:22.017
[MARINE E]
Nice shot!

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:27.260
Serves you right for looking
down on us! Little punk! [gasps]

00:12:29.265 --> 00:12:30.366
Huh?

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.243
I told you so.

00:12:36.044 --> 00:12:39.753
[SABO] I ate the Flame Flame
Fruit, if you didn't know.

00:12:39.786 --> 00:12:41.656
I don't care what
kinda power you got--

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:42.892
The Navy's not gonna lose

00:12:42.925 --> 00:12:44.996
just 'cause of one guy
with a stupid pipe!

00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:46.733
I'm telling you, don't shoot!

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.503
Fire!

00:12:58.155 --> 00:12:59.993
Keep it up men!
Don't let him breathe!

00:13:00.026 --> 00:13:02.263
Why won't you listen to me?

What the hell, man?

00:13:14.822 --> 00:13:17.427
Nobody's fingers
should be that strong!

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:21.803
These are claws.

He ate a Logia Fruit.

00:14:43.298 --> 00:14:45.804
Physical attacks go
straight through him.

[MARINE N]
Logia?

00:14:46.906 --> 00:14:48.076
[MARINE O]
He's a monster.

00:14:48.109 --> 00:14:51.516
I admit, this has become
quite the tragedy.

00:14:52.483 --> 00:14:55.222
Second in command of
the Revolutionary Army.

00:14:55.256 --> 00:14:58.630
To think we let someone
like him get that fruit.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:06.344
[BASTILLE] Step aside! You'd
better leave this one to me!

00:15:14.528 --> 00:15:18.469
I'll destroy you!

00:15:55.877 --> 00:15:58.983

00:16:02.056 --> 00:16:03.660
Well, better hold on, kitty,

00:16:03.693 --> 00:16:07.333
'cause I'm about to
clip those claws of yours!

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:14.013
A cat, huh? These are
the claws of a dragon!

00:16:16.719 --> 00:16:20.760
Claws that liberate the innocent
and tear down oppressors...

00:16:24.267 --> 00:16:25.637
[SABO]
...like you!

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:48.683
He did that with his fingers?
The thing broke in half!

00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.452
How dare you!

00:16:51.656 --> 00:16:53.459
And by the way.

00:16:53.492 --> 00:16:56.031
Once these claws
clutch a human skull,

00:16:56.064 --> 00:16:59.404
they can shatter it
to pieces like an egg.

00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:13.766
Huh?

00:17:17.975 --> 00:17:19.177
[gasps]

00:17:19.979 --> 00:17:22.416
Well, this is
quite the quandary.

00:17:26.926 --> 00:17:29.464
[FUJITORA] I brought down a
meteor, but come to think of it,

00:17:29.498 --> 00:17:34.374
the Birdcage is likely to cut it
into pieces before it gets here.

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.664
--Uh-oh.
--Run away!

00:17:48.603 --> 00:17:53.111
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:17:54.916 --> 00:17:58.756
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.075
Ah man. I should've
thought through that one.

00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:09.679
I've made a real mess of things.

00:18:09.712 --> 00:18:12.316
I don't even know where
all the pieces went.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.655
I hope I didn't
harm any civilians.

00:18:14.688 --> 00:18:18.262
Warn us before you drop
a meteor next time! It's scary!

00:18:18.295 --> 00:18:21.769
I brought down
a meteor, real sorry.

00:18:21.803 --> 00:18:23.472
Too late!

00:18:34.427 --> 00:18:36.533
[ALL]
Vice Admiral!

00:18:36.566 --> 00:18:41.474
You realize this
could get terribly ugly.

00:18:42.678 --> 00:18:45.215
[SABO] I know Admirals
are nothing to scoff at,

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:47.621
but that was one
hell of a trick.

00:18:54.034 --> 00:18:56.940
I'm still getting
used to my new powers.

00:18:56.973 --> 00:18:59.077
I'm lucky I was
able to ward that off.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.680
[MARINES gasp]

00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:08.831
Vice Admiral!

00:19:08.864 --> 00:19:10.734
Are you all right, sir?

00:19:15.476 --> 00:19:18.115
You really have caused
quite the mess.

00:19:18.148 --> 00:19:20.854
Wh-- Not half as much as you!

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.296
A moment ago, if I remember,

00:19:25.329 --> 00:19:28.101
you mentioned your
duty as a brother.

00:19:28.135 --> 00:19:29.404
[SABO]
Yeah.

00:19:29.437 --> 00:19:33.112
I can't help but be
reminded of Fire Fist Ace.

00:19:33.145 --> 00:19:34.447
When he possessed
your same power,

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.686
before he died at Marineford,

00:19:36.719 --> 00:19:39.357
he said that Straw Hat Luffy
was his brother,

00:19:39.391 --> 00:19:41.494
though not by blood.

00:19:44.535 --> 00:19:47.908
So are you also his brother?

00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:54.555
Lemme tell you guys a secret.

00:19:56.324 --> 00:19:58.062
[ACE]
All it takes to become brothers

00:19:58.095 --> 00:19:59.998
is to share some saké!

00:20:08.182 --> 00:20:10.620
[ALL]
Brothers!

00:20:11.556 --> 00:20:14.862
The three of us
exchanged a cup of saké.

00:20:18.637 --> 00:20:23.445
Even in death,
our bond will never break.

00:20:48.462 --> 00:20:50.867
I must say, that's
a rather troublesome

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.039
little family you've got there.

00:20:53.072 --> 00:20:55.075
One of them is enough!

00:20:55.108 --> 00:20:57.648
An upstart with
a massive bounty.

00:20:58.482 --> 00:21:01.655
[MARINE AB] A former commander
of the Whitebeard Pirates.

00:21:02.524 --> 00:21:03.560
[MARINE AB]
And the chief of staff

00:21:03.593 --> 00:21:05.930
from the Revolutionary Army?

00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:09.739
[SABO]
Mark my words.

00:21:09.772 --> 00:21:11.809
No matter where I am.

00:21:11.843 --> 00:21:13.680
No matter what I'm doing.

00:21:13.713 --> 00:21:16.953
Even if I must
abandon my duties.

00:21:16.986 --> 00:21:21.361
The moment that Luffy
needs my help, I'll be there.

00:21:26.204 --> 00:21:28.475
I won't let him down.

00:21:33.686 --> 00:21:35.557
[SABO screams]

00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:37.226
--[KOALA] Sabo!
--[HACK] Sabo!

00:21:37.259 --> 00:21:39.798
[SABO screams]

00:21:42.905 --> 00:21:44.575
[SABO]
Never again.

00:21:56.197 --> 00:21:58.803
I think I've asked
enough questions.

00:21:58.836 --> 00:22:00.573
Hardly any point.

00:22:01.375 --> 00:22:04.047
Sorry. Was I boring you?

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.789
I like a story better when I can
enjoy it with a cup of saké.

00:22:12.898 --> 00:22:14.367
[SABO]
Luffy.

00:22:16.004 --> 00:22:18.876
[SABO] You'll always be
our little brother.

00:22:50.306 --> 00:22:53.478
[SABO yells]

00:22:55.049 --> 00:22:56.284
[SABO yells]

00:22:56.317 --> 00:22:59.658
[MARINES gasp]

00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:06.437
[SABO] Luffy, I swear.
I'll protect you!

00:23:14.555 --> 00:23:16.424
[NARRATOR]
Robin, Rebecca, and Bartolomeo

00:23:16.457 --> 00:23:18.596
take a ride on Tontatta Airlines

00:23:18.629 --> 00:23:21.034
as they rush to get
the handcuff key to Law.

00:23:21.068 --> 00:23:23.640
Meanwhile, Luffy gets
sidetracked on his mad dash

00:23:23.673 --> 00:23:26.311
to the palace and happens
upon a hidden passage.

00:23:26.344 --> 00:23:27.948
But the would-be
shortcut may give him

00:23:27.981 --> 00:23:30.118
more trouble than
he bargained for.

00:23:30.152 --> 00:23:31.723
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.756 --> 00:23:35.697
"A Desperate Situation!
Luffy Gets Caught in a Trap!"

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.769
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
