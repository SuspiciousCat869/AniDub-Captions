1
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,057
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:40,994
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,231
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:49,402
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,905
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,273
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:56,677
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,679
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:02,249
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,318
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,789
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,991
[USOPP] "I've decided
to set out on my own

13
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,026
and visit Elbaf!"
"No! Please don't go!

14
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,095
We need you to stay!"
"I was just kidding!

15
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,630
I totally understand
not wanting

16
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,664
to live your lives without me."

17
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,001
"So, does that mean
you're staying, Usopp?"

18
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,204
[USOPP laughing]
Of course I will, dummies!

19
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,006
Man! I didn't know
anybody could love someone

20
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,909
as much as you guys love me!

21
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,712
What the hell's he
doing? What an idiot.

22
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,550
Whoa!

23
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,534
[FRANKY] Hurry it up,
Yokozuna! I need you over here!

24
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,603
[YOKOZUNA]
Gero, gero!

25
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,670
[ICEBERG]
Over here, too!

26
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,739
[YOKOZUNA]
Gero, gero!

27
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,341
[FRANKY grunting]

28
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,710
[metal scraping]

29
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:08,048
[hammar banging]

30
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,950
[PAULIE grunts] Damn it,
I'm having a hard time

31
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,185
keeping up with those two.

32
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,087
But I guess that's
Tom's Workers for ya.

33
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,388
[LULU]
No kidding.

34
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,122
It's an honor to see
Iceberg at work like this,

35
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,091
but Franky's pretty
impressive, too.

36
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,593
To think he had
all that talent...

37
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,728
[TILESTONE] I feel like
I gotta start my training

38
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,996
all over again!

39
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,564
[PAULIE] There's no use
in thinkin' like that.

40
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,799
We gotta step up our game

41
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,668
and show 'em what
Dock 1 is made of!

42
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,404
[TILESTONE, LULU]
Right!

43
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,671
[PAULIE grunts]

44
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:39,279
Lookin' nice, you guys!
Keep up the good work!

45
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:42,716
[GONBE] Meow, meow!
[KOKORO sighs]

46
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,118
[ICEBERG chuckles]

47
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,220
[FRANKY]
What're you laughin' about?

48
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:48,522
[ICEBERG]
Mwell...

49
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,957
Working with you
really brings me back.

50
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,493
When I think about all
those little battleships

51
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,294
you used to make
here on Scrap Island,

52
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,963
I can't help but chuckle.

53
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,165
Yeah, well you weren't
chucklin' back then.

54
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,267
If I recall, you were
pretty pissed off.

55
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,702
[ICEBERG]
That's true.

56
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,003
And after what
happened with Tom,

57
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,239
I felt justified in
those feelings as well.

58
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,742
But when I see this,
I understand.

59
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,512
All that experience wasn't
a waste of time after all.

60
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:14,080
It was preparing you
to build this ship.

61
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,016
[FRANKY grunts]
If you say so.

62
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,484
[ICEBERG]
When it's all said and done,

63
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:20,354
I suppose he's still
Tom's apprentice.

64
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,822
[FRANKY]
Hm?

65
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,156
With a ship like this,

66
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,225
sailing to the New World
will be more than a dream.

67
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,730
Just like Tom would say.
You did it with real gusto.

68
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:32,065
[FRANKY]
Iceberg...

69
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,235
[KOKORO]
Oh, it warms my heart

70
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:38,238
to see those two working
together for once.

71
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,473
[ICEBERG grunts]
[FRANKY] Ow!

72
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,208
Idiot! Don't you know
you're not supposed

73
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,610
to be goofin' around right now?

74
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:45,145
We got real ships to work
on, not your crappy toys!

75
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,247
Don't yell at me when
you don't have a clue

76
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,849
what you're talkin'
about, Ice-for-brains!

77
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,417
[ICEBERG]
That Franky's got a lotta nerve.

78
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,220
If I were you, I'd kick him
out for what he just did!

79
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,189
Mwell, I know the boy
can be a handful,

80
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,524
but he's a fellow shipbuilder.
At his young age,

81
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,294
he's almost on par with the
best craftsmen on the island.

82
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:06,833
He does build battleships, yeah.
His problem is he's too honest.

83
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,736
I'm positive that
both of you boys

84
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:09,937
are gonna grow up to be

85
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,472
world-class
shipwrights someday.

86
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,975
There's no need
for you to be rivals.

87
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,343
If we can keep this up,

88
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,479
we should be able to finish
way ahead of schedule.

89
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:20,681
[FRANKY]
Iceberg,

90
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,118
I told you before, this isn't
an ordinary pirate ship.

91
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,518
Yes, I know that.

92
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,254
For you, this is
an opportunity to--

93
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:30,024
[FRANKY]
Will you let me finish?

94
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,059
This is a ship for
the Straw Hat Pirates.

95
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,761
They're not a bunch
of random upstarts;

96
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:36,363
they're a group that declared
war on the World Government,

97
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,964
and burned down their flag.

98
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,400
And you're not just any
old shipwright, either.

99
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,970
You're also the mayor
of Water 7, remember?

100
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,172
If people knew you
helped build this ship.

101
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,875
It would put you in a
pretty sticky situation.

102
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,977
You understand the
consequences, don't ya?

103
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,980
[ICEBERG] I do. But I can
worry about that later.

104
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,015
Besides, Tom said it himself.

105
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,551
The ship you build
is just a ship.

106
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,622
[TOM]
Franky, there's no such thing

107
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,857
as blueprints for a pirate ship.

108
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,358
It's the flag, boy.

109
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,561
Skull and bones
means pirate ship,

110
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,631
and a seagull flag
means that it's Navy.

111
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,500
[TOM] Whatever you build,
just remember this:

112
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:19,206
Build it with pride, and a
whole lot of manly gusto!

113
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,311
[ICEBERG]
That's what I believe.

114
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:26,280
And when we build
a ship at Galley-La,

115
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:30,050
that's the mantra that
our company follows.

116
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,386
I'm not making
a pirate ship.

117
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,520
[FRANKY]
Hm?

118
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,989
[ICEBERG] I'm helping a
friend achieve his dream.

119
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,224
No matter how you look at it,

120
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,160
that's the only reason I'm here.

121
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:40,560
[FRANKY] Maybe you
should ask your friend

122
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,964
how he feels before you
butt in, Ice-for-brains!

123
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,600
[KOKORO laughing]

124
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,637
[ICEBERG] You may have
changed your life,

125
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,041
you may have changed your
face and rebuilt your body,

126
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,877
but you're the same
person I've always known.

127
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:59,246
The same old friend.

128
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,748
[FRANKY]
My dream, huh?

129
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,885
Give me Tom back!

130
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,853
[train whistling]

131
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:11,124
You hear me?
Stop now, sea train!

132
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,626
[FRANKY]
Tom...

133
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,197
[FRANKY] I don't want
to build ships anymore.

134
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,199
I can't love ships
that hurt the people

135
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:23,503
I care so much about!
I won't do it!

136
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,938
But even so...

137
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:29,142
My goal in life is
to be just like you!

138
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,716
[FRANKY grunting]

139
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,219
[FRANKY]
Come back!

140
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:42,055
Come back and
teach me once again!

141
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,097
[train whistling]

142
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,132
[FRANKY]
Because someday,

143
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:56,136
I want to build
my own dream ship!

144
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,706
A ship that will proudly sail,

145
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,276
bravely over uncharted waters,

146
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,945
all the way to the
ends of the world!

147
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:08,448
[train whistling]

148
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,219
[FRANKY]
I'm beat.

149
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,255
My body's burning up.

150
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:19,459
I'm still alive,
but at this rate,

151
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:22,563
I won't be for long.

152
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,964
[FRANKY gasps]

153
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,198
[ship creaking]

154
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,076
[FRANKY]
Nobody's here.

155
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:44,118
An abandoned ship, full of
broken wood and scrap iron.

156
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:47,588
Funny, huh? I fit right in.

157
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:51,625
I gotta do something about
this useless body of mine,

158
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,662
or I'm not gonna make it.

159
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,196
[ICEBERG]
Mwell, maybe.

160
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,932
But anyway, what's up with that
strange looking body of yours?

161
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,400
[FRANKY]
Screw you!

162
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,870
The sea train mangled my body,
so in order to stay alive,

163
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:06,139
I rebuilt it using
some iron scraps.

164
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,142
[ICEBERG]
We never change, do we?

165
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,710
Every time we meet face to face,

166
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,979
we yell and argue
with each other.

167
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:13,514
I won't forgive you,

168
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:17,617
and you may feel the
same way about me, too.

169
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:18,852
Franky...

170
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:24,157
[ICEBERG sobbing]
I'm-- I'm really--

171
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:27,728
I'm so glad that
you're still alive.

172
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:33,233
[ICEBERG sobbing]

173
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,703
[FRANKY]
Glad I'm alive, huh?

174
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,338
Well, don't go
wishin' I was dead

175
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,007
when the government
comes after you.

176
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,009
It's outta my hands now!

177
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,110
Jeez, my skull's made of iron

178
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,646
and you're more
hard-headed than me!

179
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:50,917
[USOPP]
Oh, hey there, Luffy!

180
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,619
I never expected to
run into you here!

181
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,222
What, me? Oh, I'm just
takin' a walk, that's all!

182
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,157
I guess that
settles it, huh?

183
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:58,258
Since we're already here,

184
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:01,428
I might as well
join the crew again!

185
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,131
All right, and that one
makes scenario number 53.

186
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,366
I like it, but I have
to make it look like

187
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,803
I run into him by coincidence.

188
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,337
That's a little risky.

189
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,873
Maybe I should take
a more direct approach.

190
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,475
All right, let's go for it!

191
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,110
[USOPP grunts]

192
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,260
[USOPP]
Whoa, what's going on in there?

193
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:35,228
Everyone looks so serious!

194
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:38,498
Well, I can't blame them;
I'd be upset without me, too.

195
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,700
For their sake,

196
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,703
I'd better join this crew
again before it gets ugly!

197
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,939
Scenario 34!

198
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,674
Ah-choo! Ah-choo!

199
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,377
[USOPP] I'll warm their hearts
from the chilling evening wind.

200
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:53,914
I just gotta make sure
they heard me sneeze.

201
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,182
This is it!

202
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:56,684
I can't blow it now!

203
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:00,387
Just play it cool and pretend
like it's all a coincidence!

204
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,990
"Oh, is that Usopp
I see over there?"

205
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,292
"Hey, I just happened
to be passing by!"

206
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:07,294
"That's no good at all!
It's chilly out there!

207
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,130
You better come inside
before you catch a cold!"

208
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:14,100
"Well, if you insist.
And what's that?

209
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,569
You want me to
join the crew again?

210
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,072
I guess I might as well,
since I'm already here and all!

211
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:21,074
Lemme tell ya,
it's great to be ba--!"

212
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,676
They went to sleep.

213
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,113
[USOPP sighs]

214
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,282
I better come up
with something fast,

215
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,884
or they just might
finish that ship

216
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,351
and take off without me.

217
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:34,989
It's so much easier to talk to
them when I'm Sniper King.

218
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,557
All right. I'll try harder.

219
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,325
I'll come up with an
even better scenario!

220
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,461
One that will melt
their hearts for sure!

221
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,932
[ZAMBAI]
Hey, Big Bro,

222
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,500
we brought some grub
for you to chow down on!

223
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,602
The guys from Galley-La
can have some, too!

224
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:49,636
And don't worry,

225
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,471
we've got plenty of cola
to wash it down with!

226
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,407
Yeah! Better hurry and drink
it while it's still cold!

227
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,976
[CHIMNEY] Yay!
[GONBE] Meow, meow!

228
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:00,280
[CHIMNEY] Bring it over
here first, I'm starving!

229
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:03,750
Any booze? I'm starting
to run a little dry!

230
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,418
Let Franky and
Iceberg eat first.

231
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,187
They've been at this
longer than us.

232
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,690
You two are going to pass out
if you don't take a break.

233
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:12,359
You don't have to worry about
us falling behind schedule.

234
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,861
Yeah, we'll cover for
you in the meantime.

235
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:18,465
[ICEBERG] All right, but we
might eat it all, you know.

236
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,400
If you think I'm a
good shipwright now,

237
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,337
once I get some cola in me,
I'll blow your pants off!

238
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,739
[ALL munching]

239
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,608
[FRANKY]
Recharge Complete!

240
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,876
Franky Pose Time!

241
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,610
[KIWI]
Max Power!

242
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,112
[MOZU]
Super!

243
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,413
Oh, by the way...

244
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:35,616
What'll you do when
the ship is done?

245
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,017
[FRANKY]
What'll I do?

246
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:39,186
If you give your ship
away to the Straw Hats,

247
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,755
are you sure that
you'll be satisfied?

248
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,223
Is that what your
dream is about?

249
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,826
Will it be fulfilled so easily?

250
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,728
Perhaps you should
go with them.

251
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:49,797
Surely you've considered that.

252
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,832
[FRANKY FAMILY gasps]

253
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,634
All my bros
are in Water 7.

254
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,835
No matter how awesome it is,

255
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:57,537
it's gonna take more than
a ship to get me to leave!

256
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:58,605
[ICEBERG]
I see.

257
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,207
[FRANKY FAMILY]
You mean it?

258
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,978
[FRANKY]
C'mon, back to work!

259
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,146
Yokozuna, you can
take a breather for now.

260
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,114
[YOKOZUNA]
Gero.

261
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:12,252
[ICEBERG]
Paulie, take 15.

262
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,022
[PAULIE groans]

263
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,024
[LULU grunts]

264
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,725
[TILESTONE groans]

265
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,628
[PAULIE groaning] This food is
starin' me right in the face,

266
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,965
but I'm so tired, I don't think
I have the strength to eat it.

267
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,300
[TILESTONE]
Look at us,

268
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,502
we can't even eat hotdogs
as well as those two.

269
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,536
[LULU]
It's depressing.

270
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,204
[FRANKY FAMILY]
We're cheerin' for you, Bro!

271
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,939
[FRANKY FAMILY] As soon as
you're done building the ship,

272
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,742
we're gonna throw a big party,
just like the Straw Hats did!

273
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:37,111
[MOZU]
An even bigger party!

274
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:39,512
[KIWI]
The biggest!

275
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,789
[FRANKY]
Even if it wasn't for long,

276
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:51,558
I had a lotta fun
with you guys.

277
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:57,264
[LUFFY] We'll save
you, no matter what!

278
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:00,067
[FRANKY] That's why I'm gonna
pass on my dream to you.

279
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,303
Nothing'd make me happier.
You wait, Straw Hat,

280
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:06,674
I swear I'll make you the best
damn ship you've ever seen,

281
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,942
just like I promised!

282
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,077
Big Bro...

283
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:35,236
[hammars banging]

284
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:42,409
[FRANKY FAMILY snoring]
[hammars banging]

285
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,044
[KOKORO giggles]

286
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:48,682
[PAULIE grunting]

287
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,885
[FRANKY]
Hey, Ice-for-brains!

288
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,020
I know you're gettin' tired--

289
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,421
Why don't you
take a beauty nap?

290
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,023
[ICEBERG]
Why don't you take a nap?

291
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:57,224
I don't need sleep!

292
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,159
'Cause I'm doin' super
good this evening.

293
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:02,029
Well, what do you
know? So am I!

294
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,664
[FRANKY]
Heh!

295
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,999
[ICEBERG]
Hm!

296
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,468
[KOKORO]
I hope you're watching, Tom.

297
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,236
It's been a rocky
road without you,

298
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,104
but your boys are
doing you proud.

299
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,773
You might've left us, but
watching these two right now

300
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:17,444
is like seeing the ships
you built come alive again.

301
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,680
[KOKORO chuckling]

302
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:23,450
[hammars banging]

303
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,687
[NAMI]
It's finally set!

304
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:31,024
Look, the Log Pose is
pointing to the next island!

305
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,027
[LUFFY] All that's left
is to get our ship!

306
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,361
This is gonna be fun!

307
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,397
[NAMI] I can't wait
to see the ship, myself.

308
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,866
But Franky said no peeking
until he's finished.

309
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,033
By the way, guys.

310
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,568
You know where that
log is pointing?

311
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,071
Might come as a big surprise
if you're not ready!

312
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,640
[NAMI]
Actually, I don't have a clue.

313
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,942
Come to think of it,
it kind of looks like

314
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:50,010
it's pointing down a bit.

315
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,279
[KOKORO laughing]
You bet it is!

316
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:55,349
'Cause where it's pointing is
on the bottom of the ocean!

317
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,651
It's called Fish-Man Island.

318
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:59,686
Uh--

319
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,254
Huh?

320
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:06,894
What?

321
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:09,497
We're finally going
to Fish-Man island?

322
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,364
Really?

323
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,499
Whoa! Sanji's acting weird!

324
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:15,402
[NAMI sighs]
Fish-Man Island, huh?

325
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,704
That's tricky.

326
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:18,205
[LUFFY]
Yeah, I guess so.

327
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,774
Is that gonna be tough after
what happened in your village?

328
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,778
They were pirates.

329
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,513
Not all Fish-Men are gonna
give us trouble like that.

330
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,617
[SANJI] See? Everybody knows
Fish-Man Island is awesome,

331
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,651
even Zoro! And he's stupid!

332
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:33,788
Fish-Man Island is one
of the most famous spots

333
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:34,988
on the whole Grand Line!

334
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,389
Beautiful mermaids
leap and dive,

335
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,491
painting the water with
their elegant tailfins.

336
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,094
There you can
frolic with the fish

337
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,862
and make all your
dreams come true!

338
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,797
Wow, for real? Neato!

339
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,066
[KOKORO]
Ahem.

340
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,767
[KOKORO chuckles]

341
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:51,906
[SANJI]
Let me dream, damn it!

342
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,040
I'm not hurting anyone!

343
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,077
Relax! There's young
mermaids, too!

344
00:17:57,111 --> 00:17:59,479
Thing is, even if the
place is nice to visit,

345
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,982
that don't mean it's easy
for people to get there!

346
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,350
[ROBIN] I assumed
that was the case,

347
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,019
since it's at the
bottom of the sea.

348
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:07,955
[LUFFY] Eh, we'll figure
it out on the way.

349
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,357
Well, "on the way"
is a problem, too.

350
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,662
[KOKORO] Take a look at today's
paper and you'll understand.

351
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:16,163
Huh? What is this?

352
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:18,866
14 ships have disappeared
this month alone.

353
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,767
All in the same place?

354
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,168
I don't understand.

355
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:26,540
They call that patch of
water the Florian Triangle.

356
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:29,509
[KOKORO] Anyways, you won't be
making it to Fish-Man Island

357
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,445
until after you
sail through there.

358
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:32,313
[LUFFY gasps]

359
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:33,647
[NAMI gasps]

360
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:36,817
[KOKORO] Every year, over 100
ships go missing in that area,

361
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,386
and nobody has a clue as to why.

362
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:43,357
What's spooky is that later
they show up totally empty,

363
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,493
without a single
crew member in sight.

364
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:48,128
Other people say they've
found ghost ships,

365
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:52,499
with crews of dead men wandering
the ocean, lost in a haze.

366
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:55,536
You mean they're
like zombies? Scary!

367
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:58,438
Hanging out with a buncha
skeletons sounds cool!

368
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:01,308
"Hanging out?" That's some
imagination you've got.

369
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:04,411
No way! No ghost ships
for us! Not on my watch!

370
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,213
We're passing straight
through that place!

371
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,315
I mean, what really
happens in there?

372
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:10,383
[KOKORO laughing]
Who knows!

373
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:13,687
After all, nobody ever
comes out of there alive

374
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,623
and dead men tell no tales!

375
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,025
I'd be careful!

376
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:20,627
The water is dark,
the fog is thick.

377
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,895
It swallows you up!

378
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:24,431
[NAMI, CHOPPER shrieking]

379
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,867
Many a soul has
been a sacrificed

380
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,368
to that treacherous sea.

381
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,671
So you'd better be darned
ready before you even

382
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:32,172
think of setting sail.

383
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:34,308
Although some people do
call them ghost ships,

384
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:38,045
abandoned vessels are often
called "treasure ships", too.

385
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:39,980
We're more likely to
find a ship filled with

386
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,949
riches than the undead.

387
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:43,917
Yeah! Let's hunt down
those ghost ships!

388
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,653
All right, leave it to me!

389
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,854
No, but I don't wanna!

390
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,858
I'll stock up on plenty of
food and water before we go,

391
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:53,561
so even if we do get
lost, we'll be fine.

392
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,062
A treasure ship, huh?

393
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:56,363
I wonder if they have swords.

394
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,431
[CHIMNEY]
Hey, Pirate people!

395
00:19:58,465 --> 00:19:59,132
[GONBE]
Meow!

396
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,735
[KIWI, MOZU]
Straw Hat!

397
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,837
[KIWI, MOZU grunt, panting]

398
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,839
[LUFFY]
You need something?

399
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,941
Franky wants to
talk to you guys.

400
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,144
He's got something
big to show you!

401
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:11,311
It's been a long night,

402
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:13,213
but they finished
his ship of dreams!

403
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:15,950
And boy is it super cool!

404
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:17,484
Meow!

405
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:20,654
You mean it's done already?
That was really fast!

406
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:21,956
[MOZU]
Of course!

407
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:23,157
That's what happens
when the best shipwrights

408
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,991
in the world work
around the clock!

409
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,059
[KIWI]
You better believe it!

410
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,928
What're we waiting
for? Let's go!

411
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:28,895
Yeah!

412
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:32,032
[ZAMBAI]
Straw Hat!

413
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:35,002
We've got bad news!

414
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,870
[KIWI]
Oh, hey you guys!

415
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:37,971
[MOZU]
What's going on?

416
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:38,972
They look upset.

417
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:41,742
[KIWI]
I wonder what's wrong.

418
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:45,112
[ZAMBAI grunting, panting]

419
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:46,313
To be honest,

420
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,014
we just found out
about this ourselves.

421
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:49,950
Have you seen
the wanted posters?

422
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:51,418
Wanted posters?

423
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:53,053
[ZAMBAI] You've got a huge
bounty on your head, Straw Hat!

424
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,188
They're gonna hunt
you down for sure!

425
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,990
Actually, you've
all got bounties.

426
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:59,160
The whole crew is wanted!

427
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:01,395
Took long enough! How much?

428
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:02,563
Not me, too!

429
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:03,897
I'm wanted?

430
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,900
No point in talking, just look.

431
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,769
Wanted posters for
all seven of you.

432
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,777
[ZAMBAI] Straw Hat Luffy with
a bounty of 300 million Berries.

433
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,247
[LUFFY laughing]
All right! It went up!

434
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,116
[ZAMBAI]
Pirate Hunter Zoro with a bounty

435
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:24,885
of 120 million Berries.

436
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:26,420
[ZORO grunts]

437
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:30,657
[ZAMBAI] Cat Burglar Nami with
a bounty of 16 million Berries.

438
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:32,259
No!

439
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,695
[ZAMBAI] Cotton-Candy
Loving Chopper. Pet.

440
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,431
With a bounty of 50 Berries.

441
00:21:37,465 --> 00:21:38,765
50?

442
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,403
[ZAMBAI] Demon Child Robin with
a bounty of 80 million Berries.

443
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:50,143
Who is that?

444
00:21:50,177 --> 00:21:53,614
[ZAMBAI] Black Leg Sanji.
Attempt to take a photo failed.

445
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:57,117
Bounty: 77 million Berries.

446
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,219
[NAMI groans]

447
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:01,522
Hey look, Sniper King
has one, too!

448
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:03,424
Only 50?

449
00:22:03,457 --> 00:22:05,426
Well I know that this
is probably big news

450
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,661
for you and all, and I'm
sure there's a lot of

451
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:09,896
pirate stuff you want
to talk about, but uh,

452
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,298
hold on a sec okay?

453
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,867
I came here 'cause I gotta
favor to ask of you guys.

454
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:15,503
Take a look at this.

455
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:17,137
It's Franky!

456
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,608
[ZAMBAI] Cyborg Franky, with
a bounty of 44 million Berries.

457
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:24,711
[KIWI] This is awful, Big Bro's
wanted by the World Government!

458
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:26,113
[MOZU]
What're we gonna do now?

459
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:27,714
[ZAMBAI]
Yeah, that's the question.

460
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:30,618
I was happy when I found
out we didn't have bounties.

461
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:32,219
But then this had to happen!

462
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:34,487
Everyone in the whole
city knows about our bro.

463
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,690
He can't stay
in Water 7 anymore!

464
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,091
And if he gets arrested again.

465
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,493
I don't think we'll
have the power

466
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,262
to save him like
we did last time!

467
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:43,297
But I'm sure he's
worried about us, too.

468
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,832
Knowing him, he probably
wouldn't leave the island

469
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,001
no matter how much
we begged him.

470
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:51,304
That's why we came to you.
We have no other choice!

471
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:53,140
We're begging ya
here, Straw Hat.

472
00:22:53,174 --> 00:22:54,374
Even if he tries to fight,

473
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,610
you gotta take our bro
out to sea with you!

474
00:22:56,643 --> 00:23:01,047
Come on! His parents were
pirates it's in his blood!

475
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:15,062
[LUFFY] Okay, take us
to the new ship already!

476
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:17,431
I can't wait anymore,
I'm too excited!

477
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,733
[CHOPPER]
Oh! That's it, Luffy!

478
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,268
Look! It's huge!

479
00:23:21,302 --> 00:23:25,573
[LUFFY laughing] Whoa, you're
right! Hey, but where's Franky?

480
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:26,807
Franky!

481
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,375
On the next One Piece:

482
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,911
The King of Animals
that Overlooks the Sea!

483
00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:33,780
The Dream Ship
Magnificently Completed!

484
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:36,016
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
