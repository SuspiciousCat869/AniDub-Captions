1
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,717
Captain T-Bone.

2
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,420
I don't think there's any room
for someone to hide in here.

3
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,030
Good evening!

4
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,200
It's them!

5
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,802
They were right outside!

6
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:35,636
We found 3 suspicious men,

7
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:38,038
including the
criminals in car 7!

8
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,642
I hate crooked men
and crooked swordplay.

9
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:45,245
Here comes my Right-Angle Flash!

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,115
Bone Soir!

11
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,787
They're gone!

12
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,363
Oh, no.

13
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,331
The cars are detached!

14
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,667
What?!

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,301
Damn it!

16
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,669
That's cheating!

17
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,537
You'll pay for this!

18
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,642
I was too late.

19
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,577
Have a safe trip, gentlemen!

20
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,113
Say hello to the
Sea Kings for me!

21
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,681
Fair thee well!

22
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,662
I'm Wanze!

23
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,163
It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world

24
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,065
and I'm a mad, mad,
mad, mad Wanze!

25
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:44,004
Here I come!

26
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,545
If you wanna pass
through this car,

27
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,748
you'll have to defeat me first!

28
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,355
You think you can stop us?

29
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:02,590
I know I can!

30
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,592
Go go, go, go, go, go, go!

31
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,627
This is an important
escort mission

32
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:12,166
so they got an important guy
like me to keep the train safe!

33
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,834
If you wanna rescue
that friend of yours

34
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,737
then first you'll have
to defeat my Ramen Kenpo!

35
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,511
So you're saying the rear
two cars were detached?

36
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,481
How could you allow something
like this to happen?

37
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,583
My deepest apologies,
ma'am but in our defense,

38
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,319
even Captain T-Bone got
trapped in one of those cars,

39
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,488
and you know how powerful he is!

40
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,589
Fine.

41
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,691
Give me a status report
on what's left of the train.

42
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:38,658
Yes, ma'am!

43
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,461
As of now, in addition
to the engine room,

44
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,329
there are five cars
still with us.

45
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,532
All of the military in the
fifth car have been taken out.

46
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:49,036
That leaves Wanze
guarding the fourth car.

47
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,171
Nero on duty in the third car.

48
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,507
Nico Robin up in the first car.

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,010
And everyone here
in the second car.

50
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,349
It seems our enemy is
not to be taken lightly.

51
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,318
However, the only
problem that concerns me

52
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,420
in our current situation is that

53
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,657
Franky is walking
around this train free.

54
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,259
Our mission was to take
Franky and Nico Robin

55
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:16,263
into custody and then deliver
them securely to Enies Lobby.

56
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,631
As long as we accomplish that,

57
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,800
I don't care how
many men we lose

58
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,336
or how we take care
of our enemies.

59
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:26,006
That has no bearing
on our mission.

60
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,610
And were you able to
identify the intruders?

61
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:30,711
Yes!

62
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,513
First, there are the two men
that we had in custody

63
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,281
but now it seem
that one of those two

64
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,183
is wearing some sort
of strange mask.

65
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,551
There's also a
blond guy in a suit

66
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,752
that we've never seen before,

67
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,754
making a total of
three intruders!

68
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,624
He's probably a member
of the Straw Hat pirates,

69
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,627
just like that
long-nosed man is.

70
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,164
Naturally, their purpose
here is to rescue Nico Robin.

71
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,465
And, since they freed him,

72
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,368
Franky's decided
to help them out.

73
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,403
Hey Lucci, would
you like me to go

74
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,639
and keep an eye on Nico Robin?

75
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,174
That's not necessary.

76
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,376
Just stay focused
on recapturing Franky.

77
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,812
Nothing else matters here.

78
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:10,750
So, they want to take
Nico Robin back, do they?

79
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:17,257
Sorry to break it to them but
that's just not gonna happen.

80
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,362
Like I said, this guy is mine.

81
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,563
You go on ahead.

82
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,798
I'll catch up
with you two later.

83
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,201
Remember, above everything else,

84
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,771
our priority right
now is to save Robin.

85
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,476
That's impossible!

86
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:56,183
I won't let you pass through!

87
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,652
Kneading the high quality flour.

88
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,455
Is he gonna bring out
the ramen noodles again?

89
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,757
Ramen Beam!

90
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,129
Those are sharp!

91
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,168
Damn it!

92
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,707
Cut it out!

93
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,184
Let's head over on the roof.

94
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,052
Uh, right!

95
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:36,290
We'll leave it to you then,
Sanji! Best of luck!

96
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,691
Go, go, go, go, go!

97
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,828
They're go-go-go-go gone!

98
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,230
But I suppose
that's no big deal.

99
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:44,698
'Cause the person
waiting for them

100
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,700
in the next car is
one tough customer!

101
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,635
Nero!

102
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,403
He's the latest addition to CP9!

103
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,238
An assassin for justice!

104
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,640
Those two are dead meat!

105
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,509
If there's one thing that
Nero loves to do, it's kill!

106
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,245
Go, go, go, go!

107
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,046
Flanchet...

108
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,650
...Shoot!

109
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:26,574

carries my name. ♪

110
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:30,544

113
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:35,682
This would be a whole lot easier

114
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:36,883
if we knew which
car Robin was in.

115
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:40,120
I could infiltrate from the
roof and be done in a snap.

116
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,691
Stop muttering and go already,
you stupid Slimy Squid King!

117
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:47,294
Who are you calling
a Slimy Squid King?!

118
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:54,268
Slimy Squid, Sticky Octopus.

119
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,270
Squid, octopus, whatever!

120
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,404
Just hurry!

121
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,772
Bikini Guy!

122
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,810
I've got a brilliant plan.

123
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:06,580
Listen very carefully.

124
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:18,125
This'll take forever if you
keep dodging me like that.

125
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,829
I told you, I'm in a hurry here.

126
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,297
Okay then!

127
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:23,964
Fine!

128
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,600
Ramen Kenpo: Noodle Slicer!

129
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,741
Let's see how you like this!

130
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:36,509
Fire Skate Blades!

131
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,392
Not only did you disrespect
my beautiful attack,

132
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:55,195
you kicked me
ten times, didn't you?!

133
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,197
Actually, it was twelve times.

134
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,432
Hey, you!

135
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:01,368
Are you secretly
super strong or something?

136
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,570
It's not really a secret.

137
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,471
Maybe you're just super weak.

138
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,672
Super weak?!

139
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,809
Not even my old man would
say something like that to me!

140
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,044
How dare you!

141
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:10,878
I'm Wanze!

142
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,113
I won't let you
get away with this!

143
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,314
Rude!

144
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,084
Besides, I was simply distracted
by your swirling eyebrows.

145
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,185
They make me dizzy!

146
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,319
That's why
I fell for your attack.

147
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:22,156
Still, you're a good fighter!
Too bad you look weird!

148
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,223
Hey, you freak!

149
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:26,593
You're in no position to
call anyone weird looking!

150
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,199
After that failed attack, I feel
like I need to prove myself!

151
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,535
So I'm gonna show
you something amazing!

152
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:38,171
This is why I was chosen
to escort those criminals!

153
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:53,187
Ramen Kenpo: Secret Technique!
Ramen Kenpo: Secret Technique!

154
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,691
Beat the dough, pull the dough!
Beat the dough, pull the dough!

155
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,661
What the hell is all that?

156
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:04,664
It's my incredible,
edible, combat uniform!

157
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,470
Ramen's Formal Suit!

158
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,238
Nooow fight!

159
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,740
Go, go, go, goooo!

160
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,742
Go! The secret of this
Ramen Kenpo technique

161
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:18,045
is controlling the free
moving noodles at will!

162
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,046
See?

163
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,147
Bastard.

164
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,284
How dare you disgrace
food like that, you wierdo!

165
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:27,388
My speed, my power,
and my special abilities.

166
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,490
I'm at a different level
now in all of those areas!

167
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,796
If showing you isn't enough,
I'm gonna beat it into you!

168
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,164
Go!

169
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,202
Just shut up already
and get on with it!

170
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,171
But prepare yourself,
'cause I'm gonna make you

171
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,173
eat every last one
of those noodles.

172
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,301
Question.

173
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:19,206
Who are you and what
are you doing up here?

174
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:22,509
The officer in charge
of the third car.

175
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:26,046
A Four Powers master
and a new recruit in CP9.

176
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,282
The sea weasel, Nero.

177
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,752
Unfortunately.

178
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:35,489
I'm under specific
orders not to kill you.

179
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,590
You know, you being one of

180
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,326
our most important
criminals and all.

181
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,160
All right.

182
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,428
That's one half.

183
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,331
Now tell me what you're doing up
here on the roof of this train!

184
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,734
If you had just waited inside,
I would've come to you!

185
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,669
Well, how was
I supposed to know that?

186
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:52,772
You may have tried to cheat
and skip right past this car.

187
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,475
My, my, my!

188
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:56,343
That's rather cautious of you!

189
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,344
But in your line of work,

190
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,514
you always gotta keep
your guard up, right?

191
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:04,484
By the way, what's that weird
looking thing there behind you?

192
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,795
That was a dirty trick!

193
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,334
Of course it was!

194
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,335
They don't call me

195
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,671
the King of Water 7's
Underworld for nothing!

196
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,751
Hey, hold on.

197
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,287
Where did Luffy run off to?

198
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,323
Beats me.

199
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,328
"Beats me?!" Come on!
You know that idiot!

200
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:50,497
What if he fell into
the water or something?!

201
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:52,833
Whoa! Slippery!

202
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:53,934
That's impossible.

203
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,570
I mean, he was right here up
until a few seconds ago.

204
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:57,371
Right, Chopper?

205
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,572
What? Oh! Sure!

206
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,274
This is Luffy
we're talking about!

207
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,442
That doesn't mean anything!

208
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:04,645
I'm worried because he was
here and he's not here now!

209
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,547
Maybe he's stuck in
Rocketman's chimney?

210
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,482
It happens. Right, Zoro?

211
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,182
Oh, sure!

212
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,319
And choking you "happens," too!

213
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:25,199
Just wait Robin,
we're coming for you!

214
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,334
Oh, and Usopp, too.

215
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:34,641
I'd like to welcome you to the
wonderful world of Ramen Kenpo!

216
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,711
That is the lamest
power-up ever.

217
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,280
Go, go, go!

218
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,615
Here I come!

219
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,285
Ramen Kenpo!

220
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,386
Pork Bone Spank attack!

221
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,298
That's the same useless punch
from before, only bigger.

222
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:01,401
Go, go, go! Have another!

223
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,441
Dammit! I'm stuck in
this stupid thing!

224
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:18,084
Go, go, go, go!

225
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,094
Go, go, go, go, go!
So, what do you think?

226
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,664
My Ramen Kenpo attacks are
pretty impressive, aren't they?

227
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,167
It's kind of hard to
look cool when your arm

228
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,136
and leg are buried
in noodles like that.

229
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,305
And now I believe it's
time to pay you back

230
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,708
for all those kicks
you gave me earlier!

231
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,616
What?

232
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:58,325
What the hell are you
getting dizzy for, you idiot?!

233
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,560
You were trying to make me woozy

234
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,297
using your freaky eyebrows
again, weren't you?!

235
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,498
Bad move.

236
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:07,167
You're gonna pay for that!

237
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:14,140
Go, go, go!

238
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,477
Dammit!

239
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,580
I can't pull my arm or leg out!

240
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:23,016
It's impossible to
fight back like this!

241
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:30,624
Here comes my Noodle Soul Press!

242
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,165
Want some more?

243
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:38,766
Here's...

244
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:39,833
...another helping!

245
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:44,171
Another helping! Another
helping! Another helping!

246
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,372
Another helping!

247
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,241
Take that and that
and that and that

248
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,509
and that and that
and that and that!

249
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,184
Finally, I'm free.

250
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,822
Go, go, go!

251
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:05,693
That's what you get for
underestimating me, you meanie!

252
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:10,698
No one stands a chance against
my mad, mad Ramen Kenpo!

253
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:14,201
If I attack him, I'm gonna get
caught in those noodles again.

254
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:17,137
I'll just have to avoid
that stupid suit of his.

255
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,406
Go, go, go!

256
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,474
Have a taste of this!

257
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:24,545
Ramen and Gyoza Combo!

258
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:30,517
Clap-ping!

259
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,620
And that leaves
me only one place

260
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:37,090
where I can attack
this annoying clown.

261
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,828
Escalope!

262
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:43,530
Ramen Beam!

263
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,377
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

264
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,580
As you can see,
I don't have a weak spot!

265
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:02,349
And I've already figured
out your fighting style.

266
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:05,052
Every one of your attacks
is some form of kicking.

267
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,521
So if I lock down your
legs, you're finished!

268
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,424
Go, go, go, go!

269
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,192
Sucks to be you, huh?!

270
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,226
No matter what you do,

271
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:18,799
you'll still end up
getting stuck in my suit!

272
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,234
Now, Mr. Wet Noodle,

273
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,703
while we're at it, try
this one on for size!

274
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:24,071
Ramen Kenpo!

275
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,239
Multi-Noodle Spank!

276
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,693
What in the heck did
you do to my noodles?!

277
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:56,237
I turned that hunk of
pasta fedelini into a platter.

278
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,304
Huh?

279
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,807
Some sort of trick?

280
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,377
Hey! You sliced my noodle
fists to shreds, you jerk!

281
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,216
A chef must fight without
using his hands or knives.

282
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,417
Those are sacred.

283
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:14,254
So it's always been my policy
not to use them in battle.

284
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,491
But, since we're in a kitchen

285
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,627
and you're using
food as a weapon.

286
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,163
That changes things
a bit, now doesn't it?

287
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:23,997
Well!

288
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,831
I knew you were
a pain in the butt,

289
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,268
but that one really
takes the cake!

290
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:30,670
Thousand Noodle Whip!

291
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:39,313
Trying to look cool,
you insolent little punk?!

292
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,114
Huh?!

293
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:40,981
An amateur cook
like you shouldn't

294
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,750
even touch my
precious kitchen knives!

295
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:44,318
You hear me?!

296
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:47,221
Those are meant for
trained professionals only!

297
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:48,422
See?!

298
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:51,692
I sincerely apologize for
my insolence in your kitchen.

299
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:55,028
But I'm going to let you in
on a little culinary secret.

300
00:19:57,264 --> 00:20:01,034
It's time for a demonstration.

301
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,605
This is how a real chef

302
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:08,174
gracefully handles
his kitchen knives.

303
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:16,650
Shave!

304
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:21,221
Strong Hammer!

305
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,323
Paper Art.

306
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:30,130
Tempest Kick!

307
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,576
How about a taste of Fresh Fire?

308
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:46,646
Shave!

309
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,416
Has this guy lost his mind?

310
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,185
He jumped out over the sea!

311
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:55,388
Moon Walk!

312
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:02,462
How in the hell did this freak
jump back in mid-air like that?

313
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,433
Why doesn't my Tempest Kick
have any effect on him?

314
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,735
There's something
strange about his body.

315
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,538
I've had enough of you!

316
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:13,173
Likewise!

317
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:23,516
What the hell are you?!

318
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,455
Don't let me down, octo shoes.

319
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:48,341
Long Nose?! Is that you?

320
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:54,114
Why are you here?!

321
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,763
What the hell is up
with your body?!

322
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:17,331
Well, I'm pretty
sure I'm the only guy

323
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:19,566
you'll meet that can
chill cola in his belly.

324
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,301
That's it!

325
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:21,035
I knew it!

326
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:21,869
You're not human!

327
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,704
But I've discovered
your weak point!

328
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:24,371
Hey, come on!

329
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,673
Don't be ridiculous, buddy!

330
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:27,141
I don't have a weak point.

331
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:28,275
I'm invincible!

332
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:33,347
On the next One Piece:
"Rooftop Duel! Franky vs. Nero."

333
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,782
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
