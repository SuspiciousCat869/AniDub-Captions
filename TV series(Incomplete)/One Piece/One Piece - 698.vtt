WEBVTT

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.715
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.622
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:45.698
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:48.303
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.543
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.446
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.952
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.791
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.366
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:04.869
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:08.510
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:12.752
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:16.492
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.631
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:20.868
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:23.641
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.674 --> 00:03:26.412
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:29.485
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.623
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:31.656 --> 00:03:33.894
Amidst the chaos, he also
put prices on the heads

00:03:33.928 --> 00:03:37.535
of Luffy and his allies, turning
the entire kingdom against them.

00:03:37.568 --> 00:03:38.904
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:38.938 --> 00:03:41.510
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:41.544 --> 00:03:43.547
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.718
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:45.751 --> 00:03:48.156
However, as soon as they
reached their destination,

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:49.458
they were targeted by Sugar,

00:03:49.491 --> 00:03:52.966
who wanted vengeance
for her previous defeat.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.105
[SUGAR] Neither Trafalgar Law
or Monkey D. Luffy

00:03:56.138 --> 00:03:58.911
know who I am or
what I look like.

00:03:58.944 --> 00:04:01.517
This should be a real cake walk.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.689
[USOPP] Hey, Luffy!
I know you can't hear me,

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:07.995
but I really don't wanna hit
the seas without you, buddy!

00:04:10.434 --> 00:04:11.670
[USOPP]
I see them!

00:04:11.704 --> 00:04:16.045
Special! Long-Range
Attack! Bag Worm!

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.592
Huh?

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:30.608
[SUGAR screams]

00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:31.744
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Sugar, no!

00:04:31.777 --> 00:04:34.782
Damn it, she's knocked
out cold again!

00:04:37.254 --> 00:04:39.526
[USOPP]
I got your back.

00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:43.767
[USOPP]
Just keep pushing ahead!

00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:51.348
Mingo! We're here!

00:04:53.253 --> 00:04:55.190
Welcome to my roost.

00:04:55.224 --> 00:04:58.196
Please disregard the mess.

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.703
I wasn't expecting
any company this late.

00:05:01.736 --> 00:05:03.774
So, do tell me.

00:05:03.807 --> 00:05:07.080
What brings you
vermin here today?

00:05:07.113 --> 00:05:09.318
I'm here to whoop
your sorry butt!

00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:11.055
Same here.

00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:17.334
How sad. For you.

00:05:20.407 --> 00:05:21.977
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:25.049
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

00:05:30.695 --> 00:05:31.930
But how?

00:05:37.307 --> 00:05:38.644
[GLADIUS]
Huh?

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.763
Well, that explains
their giant stature.

00:05:47.796 --> 00:05:51.069
Each toy was made up
of several soldiers.

00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:52.237
No qualms with turning

00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:54.609
your own comrades
into weapons, I see!

00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:57.682
How dastardly!
Have you no honor?

00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:02.057
[GLADIUS] Impossible.
Did Sugar pass out again?

00:06:05.664 --> 00:06:07.167
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE C]
Come on, Sugar!

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.606
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE D]
Wake up! You gotta stay with us!

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:12.545
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Please, Sugar!

00:06:12.578 --> 00:06:16.853
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E cries]
That was awful!

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:18.657
We thought we were gonna
be stuck as that thing

00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:20.928
for the rest of our lives!

00:06:22.331 --> 00:06:24.736
[GLADIUS]
Have a little more faith in us.

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:27.509
We were going to turn you back
as soon as the battle ended,

00:06:27.542 --> 00:06:29.278
without question.

00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:31.181
Yeah? That really true?

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:32.785
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE H]
I should have known better!

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.989
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE I]
Shame on us!

00:06:36.258 --> 00:06:38.263
[GLADIUS]
Fools. They don't realize

00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:41.402
we too forgot that
they even existed.

00:06:41.436 --> 00:06:42.706
[BARTOLOMEO]
All right!

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:46.378
My barrier's all recharged
and ready to go!

00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:49.251
If you pinheads wanna
step up to Mister Luffy,

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.089
you'll have to get through me!

00:06:51.122 --> 00:06:53.961
[GLADIUS] Heh. You fleas think
you have a shot just because

00:06:53.994 --> 00:06:56.900
the toys are no longer
at our command?

00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:59.471
Your confidence is
utterly baseless.

00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:02.511
I will finish you off,
personally.

00:07:07.287 --> 00:07:10.260
I'm not about to
let my captain down.

00:07:10.293 --> 00:07:11.997
I imagine one's
acclaim would soar

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:14.034
by defeating an Executive.

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:17.173
Nothing can stop me
from trouncing you now!

00:07:18.477 --> 00:07:19.946
[BARTOLOMEO]
Heh.

00:07:25.457 --> 00:07:32.672
[laughing]

00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:43.960
No, Bellamy!

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:51.777
[chuckles] Concerned
for him, huh?

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.116
Interesting. You two had
a fight back in Mock Town,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.588
if I recall, right?

00:08:04.468 --> 00:08:07.407
[DOFLAMINGO]
When did guys get so chummy?

00:08:07.441 --> 00:08:13.620
Yeah! When? Go on. Go on!

00:08:13.653 --> 00:08:16.593
Hey! Hey! Don't
leave us hanging!

00:08:16.626 --> 00:08:18.964
When? When? Huh?

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.176
The time of pirates'
dreams are over!

00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:29.953
[BELLAMY] So when I see people
chasing dreams of One Piece,

00:08:29.986 --> 00:08:32.257
I get disgusted.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.334
I don't care about
the past. Let Bellamy go!

00:08:37.368 --> 00:08:39.104
Heh.

00:08:39.137 --> 00:08:40.707
[BELLAMY groans]

00:08:40.741 --> 00:08:45.818
[DOFLAMINGO] Nah. That's for
the victor to decide.

00:08:48.624 --> 00:08:53.600
This pitiful worm
crawled here just to die.

00:08:53.634 --> 00:08:56.071
Isn't that right, Bellamy?

00:08:57.675 --> 00:08:59.846
[DOFLAMINGO]
Go on. Tell him.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.716
You entered the
coliseum competition

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.756
to earn an Executive
spot in my family.

00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:07.294
But it was hard, wasn't it?

00:09:07.327 --> 00:09:10.299
You got your ass handed to you.

00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:12.905
[DOFLAMINGO]
That pathetic display was

00:09:12.939 --> 00:09:15.811
more than enough reason for me
to put you out of your misery,

00:09:15.844 --> 00:09:18.483
but I gave you a second chance.

00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:20.955
If you killed Straw Hat,

00:09:20.988 --> 00:09:24.128
I would, in turn,
accept you as an Executive.

00:09:24.161 --> 00:09:26.365
But you didn't deliver
on our agreement,

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.902
which is why I think
your punishment

00:09:27.936 --> 00:09:30.440
should be final this time.

00:09:30.473 --> 00:09:33.814
It's only fair, Bellamy.

00:09:40.393 --> 00:09:47.608
[BELLAMY grunting]

00:09:52.518 --> 00:09:56.158
There's a big wave that's about
to crash through this world,

00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:59.966
and I think that Doflamingo's
ship can ride it out.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.874
Either way, I'm done
laughing at you.

00:10:03.908 --> 00:10:06.379
Doflamingo is
a real hero of mine.

00:10:06.412 --> 00:10:09.218
I've been a fan
ever since I was a kid.

00:10:09.251 --> 00:10:14.528
[BELLAMY crying]

00:10:14.562 --> 00:10:19.806
Even now, I'm loyal
to Doflamingo!

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:23.145
No matter what,
I'll always respect him.

00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:34.769
[DOFLAMINGO]
I believe it's about time

00:10:34.802 --> 00:10:38.611
for you to take responsibility.

00:10:38.644 --> 00:10:40.814
Thoughts, Bellamy?

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:43.720
You worshiped the
ground I walked on,

00:10:43.753 --> 00:10:46.526
but when things got too tough,
you got desperate.

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:48.262
Truly pathetic.

00:10:48.295 --> 00:10:49.465
Cry if you like,

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:52.771
but people can't change
the nature they're born with.

00:11:00.788 --> 00:11:03.058
How sad you'll never
amount to anything more

00:11:03.092 --> 00:11:07.434
than a dime-a-dozen
thug, Bellamy!

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:11.843
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:11:11.877 --> 00:11:13.914
Bellamy did change!

00:11:13.947 --> 00:11:16.351
You take that back now!

00:11:17.387 --> 00:11:19.224
It's okay.

00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:25.102
Just... kill me already.

00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:26.405
I beg you.

00:11:26.438 --> 00:11:30.380
[laughs]

00:11:30.413 --> 00:11:32.284
[yells]

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:33.888
Hey. Straw Hat!

00:11:33.921 --> 00:11:38.429
Set Bellamy free, Mingo!

00:11:44.308 --> 00:11:48.182
[gasps] Damn it! I'm sorry!

00:11:48.215 --> 00:11:51.656
Didn't we just talk
about this, huh? You moron!

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.666
I told you if you lose your cool
he gets exactly what he wants!

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.469
He's provoking you!

00:11:58.504 --> 00:12:00.708
Control your anger!

00:12:00.741 --> 00:12:02.477
Or he wins.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.651
[LAW]
Next time you lose your temper,

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:08.188
you could wind up
losing your head.

00:12:09.358 --> 00:12:13.533
I foolishly found
that out firsthand.

00:12:25.356 --> 00:12:29.164
[LAW] Doflamingo is a
manipulative, heartless monster.

00:12:29.198 --> 00:12:32.270
Always looking to expose
a moment of weakness.

00:12:32.304 --> 00:12:39.084
[laughing]

00:12:40.855 --> 00:12:43.493
You kicked your dyin'
buddy in the face!

00:12:43.527 --> 00:12:46.499
Now that's a riot! [laughs]

00:12:46.533 --> 00:12:50.541
Why'd you do that? Huh? Huh?

00:12:50.574 --> 00:12:53.079
He's sure seen better days!

00:12:53.112 --> 00:12:57.855
Bam! Right in the nose! [laughs]

00:12:57.888 --> 00:12:59.391
What'd you say?

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:01.128
They're just goading you!

00:13:01.161 --> 00:13:05.202
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
How dare you, Law!

00:13:05.236 --> 00:13:08.510
I'm hurt that you think
of me as "heartless."

00:13:10.548 --> 00:13:13.521
[DOFLAMINGO] "Spiteful" maybe,
and a man who loses his temper

00:13:13.554 --> 00:13:15.090
from time to time, yes.

00:13:15.123 --> 00:13:18.229
But heartless? Give me
a bit more credit.

00:13:18.262 --> 00:13:20.735
Think about the position
you all put me in.

00:13:20.768 --> 00:13:22.938
Remember what you did?

00:13:26.245 --> 00:13:27.815
[DOFLAMINGO]
You started this by destroying

00:13:27.848 --> 00:13:31.022
my SAD production machinery.

00:13:31.055 --> 00:13:34.829
Then, you attacked
both Vergo and Monet.

00:13:34.863 --> 00:13:37.233
You also abducted Caesar.

00:13:37.266 --> 00:13:39.304
Recently, you barged
into my home

00:13:39.337 --> 00:13:43.279
here in Dressrosa and
freed all the toys.

00:13:43.312 --> 00:13:46.052
And at present,
your people are currently

00:13:46.085 --> 00:13:48.991
attempting to destroy
my SMILE factory.

00:13:49.024 --> 00:13:52.330
I've tolerated your
antics long enough.

00:13:52.363 --> 00:13:55.337
But you know why
I'm still smiling?

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:58.275
'Cause I'm thinking about
what I'll do to you!

00:13:58.308 --> 00:14:00.247
[TREBOL laughs]

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.852
Actually, what's most
insulting is that

00:14:02.886 --> 00:14:05.189
you think you can
come up and kill me.

00:14:05.223 --> 00:14:09.064
Though I admit, you have
made my life difficult.

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:12.905
It feels like I'm
re-experiencing the trauma

00:14:12.938 --> 00:14:15.944
of what happened 13 years ago.

00:14:25.597 --> 00:14:27.735
If it wasn't for that moment,

00:14:27.768 --> 00:14:29.471
I would have never come back

00:14:29.505 --> 00:14:32.344
seeking revenge on
a twisted bastard like you!

00:14:32.377 --> 00:14:35.216
If it wasn't for
that very incident, Law,

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:38.924
you'd be here answering
to me as "Corazon."

00:14:38.957 --> 00:14:41.996
You know that's
the undeniable truth.

00:15:37.373 --> 00:15:41.114
Now. Black Knight,
give them a show!

00:15:42.818 --> 00:15:45.089
[LAW]
Huh? Another clone?

00:15:51.102 --> 00:15:55.510
Take that one, Traffy!
I'll get the real Mingo!

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:01.989
Move, Bellamy!

00:16:03.192 --> 00:16:04.562
Hey, what was that?

00:16:04.595 --> 00:16:06.032
I thought we were cool!

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:08.504
I told you I was sorry!

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:11.609
[yells]

00:16:12.611 --> 00:16:15.316
[BELLAMY yells]

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:18.523
[LAW] Straw Hat! He's being
used like a puppet!

00:16:21.228 --> 00:16:24.769
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:16:24.802 --> 00:16:29.712
[BELLAMY groans]
I'm sorry, Straw Hat.

00:16:29.746 --> 00:16:34.555
Stop me! Please, somehow!

00:16:38.062 --> 00:16:40.099

00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:43.071

Guillotine High-Heel!

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.616
[DELLINGER giggles]
Your nifty Destruction Cannon

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.487
can make anything
go kablooey, right?

00:17:24.522 --> 00:17:30.132
[squeals] I find it to be
quite delightful! Destruction!

00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:33.606

[yells]

00:18:06.305 --> 00:18:08.108
There's only one way
this can end!

00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:09.812
I'm taking you out!

00:18:09.845 --> 00:18:10.914

[grunting]

00:19:14.107 --> 00:19:15.844
That s'pposed to hurt me?

[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:23.927
Sorry. All I felt was a gentle
breeze against my bonnet.

[WOMAN 664B]
Oh! He's so cool!

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:29.705

be his bonnet for a minute!

He's the toughest of the tough!

00:19:32.812 --> 00:19:36.519

can do better, then be my guest!

00:19:49.377 --> 00:19:51.615
[FRANKY]
Heh! Baby slaps!

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:55.456
You're gonna need more than
a dirty diaper to waste me.

00:19:57.193 --> 00:20:00.934
Was that the pitter-patter of
a caterpillar tickling my brow?

00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:02.838
[DWARVES]
He's so cool!

00:20:02.872 --> 00:20:04.975

[DWARVES cheer]

00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:37.942
I dunno how important
this guy is to you,

00:20:37.975 --> 00:20:39.177
but if you want him to stop,

00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:40.580
you need to
knock his lights out!

00:20:40.613 --> 00:20:44.555

Please, Straw Hat!

00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:47.561

[BELLAMY groaning]

00:21:06.364 --> 00:21:08.235
[DOFLAMINGO]
Another hit or two from your pal

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:10.273
should finish you off.

00:21:10.306 --> 00:21:12.578
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:15.717
Seems like a
fitting end for you.

00:21:15.751 --> 00:21:19.725
Do you remember what I told you
all those years ago, Law?

00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:24.635
"Weaklings don't have the right
to decide how they get to die."

00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:30.312
[screams]

00:21:30.346 --> 00:21:32.551
You bastard, Mingo!

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:36.926
We came all this way and the
coward won't fight us himself!

00:21:36.959 --> 00:21:40.800
Hey, Traffy! I think it's time!

00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:43.739
He's pissing me off!

00:21:44.508 --> 00:21:48.115
You moron.
That's our secret plan!

00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:50.219
You never listen, do you?

00:21:50.253 --> 00:21:54.160
I'm calling it! Gum-Gum...

00:21:54.194 --> 00:21:56.966
You dumbass.
I could strangle you!

00:21:56.999 --> 00:21:59.572
[LUFFY yelling]

00:21:59.605 --> 00:22:01.474
Is he going straight for Law?

00:22:01.509 --> 00:22:04.247
Did his brain go mush
under all this pressure?

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.723
Now that's too funny! [laughs]

00:22:08.757 --> 00:22:09.992
Room, go!

00:22:10.026 --> 00:22:10.860
[DOFLAMINGO]
Hm?

00:22:10.894 --> 00:22:14.400
[yelling]

00:22:15.803 --> 00:22:17.607
Ready? Shambles!

00:22:19.143 --> 00:22:21.882
...Red Hawk!

00:22:21.916 --> 00:22:23.786
[DOFLAMINGO groans]

00:22:23.819 --> 00:22:27.895
[LUFFY yells]

00:22:27.928 --> 00:22:31.434
[gasps] Doffy!

00:22:32.605 --> 00:22:33.873
Huh?

00:22:35.343 --> 00:22:36.712
Huh?

00:22:37.981 --> 00:22:40.286
Now, Radio Knife.

00:22:40.319 --> 00:22:44.795
[TREBOL gasps]

00:22:48.235 --> 00:22:49.638
[LAW]
Damn it, Straw Hat!

00:22:49.671 --> 00:22:52.009
You really are
the worst, aren't you?

00:22:52.042 --> 00:22:57.921
What can I say?
That's just our Generation!

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.890
[NARRATOR]
Pulling off their secret plan,

00:23:15.924 --> 00:23:17.728
Luffy and Law
go on the offensive!

00:23:17.761 --> 00:23:20.031
However, as Doflamingo's
patience runs thin,

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.804
he launches one overwhelming
counterattack after another,

00:23:22.837 --> 00:23:25.342
backing his opponents
into a corner once again.

00:23:25.376 --> 00:23:26.812
In the midst of
their brutal battle,

00:23:26.846 --> 00:23:29.083
the shocking history of
the coldblooded Warlord

00:23:29.117 --> 00:23:30.620
is revealed at last.

00:23:30.654 --> 00:23:32.524
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.557 --> 00:23:33.826
"A Noble Family!
