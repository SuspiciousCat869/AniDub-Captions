WEBVTT

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.884
[TEACH cackles] My darkness
will swallow the world,

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:34.388
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:36.258
You think I’ll lose to you?

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:38.463
I’m gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:42.739
Roger’s treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:38.082
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:40.955
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.988 --> 00:02:46.232
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.737
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.011
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:53.915
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:56.286
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.757
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:03.333
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:05.003
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:08.878
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:12.752
I’m gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:17.260
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:17.294 --> 00:03:20.534
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:22.972
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:25.444
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:27.748
Luffy had intended to win
a tournament that promised

00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:30.421
the Flame Flame fruit to the
champion, but abandoned that

00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:32.926
plan when Law was
captured by Doflamingo.

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.430
Now, he rushes to the
palace to save him.

00:03:35.463 --> 00:03:38.538
Meanwhile, the Block D match
has come to a conclusion.

00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:41.108
[gasps]

00:03:41.142 --> 00:03:42.945
[REBECCA]
Is something wrong with him?

00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:46.252
[snores]

00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:48.089
[REBECCA]
He fell asleep?

00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:56.172
[yelling]

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.810
[MARINE C]
He’s a sleepwalker?

00:04:31.844 --> 00:04:33.346
[BASTILLE]
Correct.

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.686
Hakuba only awakens while
Cavendish is fast asleep.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.293
One could even refer to him
as a sort of alter-ego.

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.170
[REBECCA]
I made it.

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:49.145
[LUFFY]
You want something?

00:04:49.178 --> 00:04:51.015
Are you Straw Hat Luffy?

00:04:51.048 --> 00:04:52.150
Yeah. What’s up?

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:53.521
[KIN’EMON, ZORO]
Don’t tell her!

00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:55.123
Come with me.

00:04:55.157 --> 00:04:57.795
I’m here to help guide
you into the palace.

00:05:02.873 --> 00:05:08.016
[LUFFY] "The Admiral’s Decision!
Fujitora vs. Doflamingo!"

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:11.890
[CROWD cheering]

00:05:11.923 --> 00:05:15.363
Now, time for the final round!

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:19.471
This just in.

00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:22.578
The four executives scheduled
to participate today

00:05:22.612 --> 00:05:26.453
have shockingly announced their
withdrawal from the competition!

00:05:26.486 --> 00:05:29.659
I am at a loss here,
folks. My apologies!

00:05:29.693 --> 00:05:34.067
[CROWD]
What?

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:35.805
[WOMAN A] I was looking
forward to swooning over

00:05:35.838 --> 00:05:37.676
that hard-boiled Señor!

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:40.781
[MAN A] I wanted to see
Lao G in action!

00:05:40.814 --> 00:05:42.785
[WOMAN B] We don’t get to
watch Vise bring the pain?

00:05:42.818 --> 00:05:45.892
I was looking forward to
Dellinger’s High Heel attacks!

00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:46.894
Don’t fret!

00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:48.597
We’ve got a treat in store!

00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:52.170
Subbing in is none other
than our coliseum’s hero:

00:05:52.203 --> 00:05:55.912
Mister Diamante!

00:05:55.945 --> 00:05:57.782
He will be showing up
in the finals

00:05:57.815 --> 00:06:00.387
and throwing down
in their stead!

00:06:00.421 --> 00:06:02.258
[MAN C]
Diamante!

00:06:02.291 --> 00:06:04.596
[WOMAN C]
Oh, Diamante!

00:06:09.205 --> 00:06:10.473
[MEDIC A]
Take him to the Medical Room!

00:06:10.508 --> 00:06:11.776
[MEDIC B]
Hurry!

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:22.364
[snoring]

00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:25.336
I’m gonna need some more
bandages, and fast!

00:06:30.347 --> 00:06:31.415
[gasps]

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.159
[REBECCA] Thank you for
your sacrifice, Agilia.

00:06:36.192 --> 00:06:37.995
It won’t be in vain.

00:06:52.358 --> 00:06:54.494
Ah! Lucy!

00:06:56.065 --> 00:06:58.302
I’m in the finals, too!

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:03.145
Huh? Lucy?

00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:07.020
It’s not him!

00:07:07.054 --> 00:07:08.056
[BARTOLOMEO]
Not cool!

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:09.024
What makes you think you’re

00:07:09.057 --> 00:07:11.195
worthy of speaking
to him like that?

00:07:12.364 --> 00:07:15.704
Oh, you must be Rebecca?

00:07:15.738 --> 00:07:18.577
I’m actually rather familiar
with your backstory.

00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:22.384
Then, you know
about my family?

00:07:22.418 --> 00:07:25.725
I’m going to cause a bit
of commotion here shortly,

00:07:25.758 --> 00:07:28.195
but I swear,
I won’t do you wrong.

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:47.201
[SABO] It’s all about putting
on appearances around here.

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:49.605
There’s something
about this kingdom.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.466
[SABO] I can’t help but think
of the place I grew up.

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:20.968
[ZORO] It’s great ya
wanna help us and all,

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.872
but I doubt you can do anything.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.043
[KIN’EMON] We’ve caught
wind that one needs

00:08:25.076 --> 00:08:27.982
a sort of pass
to enter the lift.

00:08:28.016 --> 00:08:30.387
Don’t worry. I have
the pass you mentioned.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.890
[KIN’EMON]
Oh! Then in that event--

00:08:31.923 --> 00:08:34.094
But you should take
another route instead.

00:08:34.128 --> 00:08:36.432
[KIN’EMON]
What? Why do you advise that?

00:08:38.804 --> 00:08:40.306
[VIOLET] While the lift
would take you directly

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.945
to the palace entrance,
it’s too risky.

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:45.985
If they find out who
you are, it’s all over.

00:08:46.018 --> 00:08:47.220
[LUFFY]
Back to plan A then!

00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:48.958
Let’s kick ass and bust in!

00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:50.327
[ZORO]
That won’t work!

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.998
They’ll just keep sending out
more guards for us to fend off!

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:56.272
[LUFFY]
Huh? Oh, yeah. Right.

00:08:56.305 --> 00:08:58.242
And more importantly...

00:08:58.276 --> 00:09:01.115
[KIN’EMON]
Please proceed.

00:09:01.148 --> 00:09:02.618
[VIOLET]
You look suspicious.

00:09:02.652 --> 00:09:04.656
[KIN’EMON]
Madam, I’m offended!

00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:06.258
[ZORO]
Hey, come to think of it,

00:09:06.292 --> 00:09:09.264
aren’t you the one who lured
our idiot cook away earlier?

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:10.634
[LUFFY]
Sanji?

00:09:10.667 --> 00:09:11.435
There you are!

00:09:11.469 --> 00:09:16.078
[SANJI]
Ooh! Violet, my sweet!

00:09:16.112 --> 00:09:18.684
Yes, and he hurried off
to protect your ship.

00:09:18.717 --> 00:09:20.621
[ZORO]
Uh-huh, we know the rest.

00:09:20.655 --> 00:09:23.827
So you were the one who told him
the Sunny was in trouble, huh?

00:09:23.861 --> 00:09:25.965
[KIN’EMON] Then, perchance,
did you provide Sir Sanji

00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:28.336
with the map to the
Toy House as well?

00:09:28.369 --> 00:09:30.240
[VIOLET]
Yes, that was me.

00:09:30.273 --> 00:09:32.311
[KIN’EMON] How did you
acquire such an item?

00:09:32.344 --> 00:09:35.785
I was one of
Doflamingo’s subordinates.

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:37.855
[LUFFY]
What? For real?

00:09:37.888 --> 00:09:39.158
[WICKA]
It’s true!

00:09:39.191 --> 00:09:42.197
But she was only
pretending to be a bad guy!

00:09:44.836 --> 00:09:46.238
Wicka, it’s you!

00:09:46.272 --> 00:09:49.412
[gasps] Wow!
You actually remember me?

00:09:49.445 --> 00:09:51.950
Come now, did you
forget about my ability?

00:09:51.983 --> 00:09:55.223
I’ve been keeping a close watch
on your people this entire time.

00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:57.193
I also know about the plan.

00:09:57.227 --> 00:09:59.866
You’re fighting alongside
the brave one-legged soldier

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.241
who’s been looking after Rebecca
since my sister passed away.

00:10:04.274 --> 00:10:06.580
We’ll wreck the facilities

00:10:06.613 --> 00:10:08.684
and defeat the
Doflamingo Family.

00:10:08.717 --> 00:10:12.090
Then, King Riku will
return to the throne!

00:10:12.123 --> 00:10:15.397
You’ve been working so hard!

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.035
Thank you for still
believing in my father.

00:10:23.078 --> 00:10:25.784
Princess Viola!

00:10:29.992 --> 00:10:34.201
[FRANKY yells]

00:10:34.235 --> 00:10:37.340
Here comes another
"“Strong Right"”!

00:10:39.646 --> 00:10:40.781
Huh?

00:10:44.756 --> 00:10:46.593
[MACHVISE]
Da-yeeeen!

00:10:46.627 --> 00:10:47.895
Huh?

00:10:47.929 --> 00:10:49.464
[MACHVISE]
Ton-Ton!

00:10:57.013 --> 00:10:57.848
What was that?

00:10:57.881 --> 00:10:58.784
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE H]
Now, men!

00:10:58.818 --> 00:11:00.486
Give this guy all ya got!

00:11:00.521 --> 00:11:01.757
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES yell]

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.329
[groans] Come on!
What is this crap?

00:11:05.363 --> 00:11:07.033
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES yell]

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:08.970
I’ve had enough!

00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:12.477
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES whimper]

00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:14.815
Franky Rocket...

00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:24.736
[FRANKY]
...wait for it...

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:28.744
...Launcher!

00:11:28.777 --> 00:11:30.781
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.117
Run away!

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.654
That guy is crazy!

00:11:33.687 --> 00:11:34.722
I thought it would launch from

00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:38.263
the cannon on his head,
but I guess not, huh?

00:11:38.296 --> 00:11:40.867
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:11:43.774 --> 00:11:46.646
Ah! Señor! Get out of there!

00:11:48.315 --> 00:11:50.419
Come on! Use your dive ability!

00:11:50.453 --> 00:11:51.790
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE I]
You can clean your teeth

00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:53.426
with a shoeshine brush later!

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:54.529
[WOMEN gasp]

00:11:54.562 --> 00:11:56.098
No way!

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.603
He’s such a hard-boiled guy!

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:00.974
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE I]
Señor, please!

00:12:01.008 --> 00:12:02.778
The molars can wait!

00:12:03.913 --> 00:12:05.383
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE L]
I’m sure your tongue is clean!

00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:07.287
Move!

00:12:07.321 --> 00:12:09.324
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE I]
Señor!

00:12:09.357 --> 00:12:11.729
Señor Pink! No!

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:13.499
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Señor Pink!

00:12:13.534 --> 00:12:15.671
[WOMEN]
Señor!

00:12:15.704 --> 00:12:18.442
Why didn’t you use your
powers to dodge that?

00:12:21.015 --> 00:12:22.819
You shouldn’t make
blind assumptions

00:12:22.852 --> 00:12:24.354
about others, you punks.

00:12:24.388 --> 00:12:25.857
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

00:12:28.262 --> 00:12:31.503
[SEÑOR] I use my Swim Swim Fruit
powers on my own terms.

00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:34.040
Yes, I can move through
walls and floors...

00:12:35.977 --> 00:12:38.015
...but under no
circumstances ever

00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:40.353
would I use it to run
away from the enemy.

00:12:43.594 --> 00:12:45.262
[SEÑOR]
In other words...

00:12:49.672 --> 00:12:53.178
I’ll go for a swim
when I feel like it.

00:12:55.317 --> 00:12:58.022
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
He’s such a rebel!

00:12:59.692 --> 00:13:01.996
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE M]
Huh? Is that brandy?

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.401
O-Oh, he’s bleeding all over!

00:13:04.434 --> 00:13:06.472
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE N]
I think he broke a bone or two!

00:13:06.506 --> 00:13:08.877
[BOTH] He’s cleansing
his wounds with brandy?

00:13:08.911 --> 00:13:10.246
I see now!

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:11.348
[WOMEN]
Huh?

00:13:11.382 --> 00:13:12.618
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE M]
Señor!

00:13:12.651 --> 00:13:14.454
You’re way too good
for this world.

00:13:14.488 --> 00:13:18.028
You’ve put your life at risk
and taken a hit head-on...

00:13:18.062 --> 00:13:19.966
...because you knew.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.807
Your colleague was
incapacitated behind you!

00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:25.945
My tummy’s hurt-eeeen!

00:13:25.978 --> 00:13:27.280
[WOMAN E]
Aw!

00:13:27.313 --> 00:13:29.285
My heart can’t take it!

00:13:29.318 --> 00:13:32.056
Señor, I would die for you!

00:13:34.929 --> 00:13:38.235
That was long time ago.
Don’t dwell on the past.

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:40.273
[WOMEN]
Make love to me, Señor!

00:13:40.306 --> 00:13:42.410
Hey, Vise, can you stand up?

00:13:42.444 --> 00:13:45.116
[MACHVISE]
Yeah, yeah! I’m fi-eeeen!

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.557
Damn, that guy’s
hard-boiled as hell.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:52.197
[MACHVISE]
Da-yeeeen! Ton-Ton!

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.800
[FRANKY yells]

00:13:59.011 --> 00:14:02.417
[MACHVISE groans]
My tum-tum! The pa-yeeeen!

00:14:04.321 --> 00:14:05.590
[FRANKY]
What the...?

00:14:05.624 --> 00:14:08.429
Oh, no, musta
missed agai-yeeeen!

00:14:08.463 --> 00:14:11.168
Quit moving around like
some verm-eeeen, dangit!

00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:12.270
Shut up, man!

00:14:12.304 --> 00:14:14.308
What the super-hell
is with you guys?

00:14:14.341 --> 00:14:16.846
[MARINE OFFICER A]
Stop right there.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.885
Cyborg Franky of the
Straw Hat Pirates!

00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:28.169
We’ll be seizing the Toy House!
So better surrender to us now!

00:14:28.202 --> 00:14:30.774
Huh? Why’s the Navy interfering?

00:14:30.808 --> 00:14:31.710
What’s that?

00:14:31.743 --> 00:14:34.381
Did I just miss someth-eeeen?

00:14:34.415 --> 00:14:36.887
I don’t recall
ordering more trouble.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.624
All right, open fire!

00:14:38.657 --> 00:14:40.226
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

00:14:42.598 --> 00:14:43.399
[FRANKY]
Groovy.

00:14:43.433 --> 00:14:45.269
Guess that makes
me their target?

00:14:45.302 --> 00:14:48.810
You wanna fight, too?
I’ll take all you suckers on!

00:14:48.843 --> 00:14:50.647
Now, bring it!

00:15:15.931 --> 00:15:18.536
[DOFLAMINGO] Sounds like
the Navy is on the move.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.976
I’m thrilled you made the
right choice, Fujitora.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.780
Smart man.

00:15:27.153 --> 00:15:29.825
[FUJITORA] Well, I’m not ready
to declare where I stand

00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:32.732
in these complicated
matters just yet.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.467
[DOFLAMINGO]
Hm...

00:15:34.502 --> 00:15:37.007
We can’t take risks
with Straw Hat afoot,

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.344
and with other suspicious
parties getting involved,

00:15:39.377 --> 00:15:41.282
consider it a
precautionary measure.

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:43.953
Our choice was made for us.

00:15:46.358 --> 00:15:49.097
[FUJITORA] The Navy’s primary
priority is to curtail

00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:52.403
the suffering of small
folk in this scuffle.

00:15:54.474 --> 00:15:56.812
If Straw Hat’s intention
is to take you down,

00:15:56.846 --> 00:15:59.050
then I’d wager he’d do
that with little regard

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:02.190
for anything or
anyone in his path.

00:16:04.795 --> 00:16:07.300
[FUJITORA] And if my sense
of justice is correct,

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:10.306
those humble folks will
need my assistance.

00:16:14.414 --> 00:16:15.650
Once that is settled,

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:19.925
I’ll be taking care
of you... personally.

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:21.963
[DOFLAMINGO]
Excuse me?

00:16:28.944 --> 00:16:31.114
[FUJITORA] Now I may be
a newcomer to this game,

00:16:31.148 --> 00:16:33.553
recruited through the
World Military Draft,

00:16:33.586 --> 00:16:37.127
but since I was appointed to
the position of Navy Admiral,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.400
I’ve got but a
simple goal in mind.

00:16:40.433 --> 00:16:43.106
And that is?

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:45.276
[FUJITORA]
I won’t stop

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.215
till I bear witness to
the complete abolition

00:16:48.248 --> 00:16:51.689
of this accursed
Seven Warlords system.

00:17:01.576 --> 00:17:04.013
[FUJITORA] A time back,
there was a pirate who came in

00:17:04.047 --> 00:17:05.984
like a ball of fire
and attempted

00:17:06.017 --> 00:17:08.089
to force his will
over some kingdom.

00:17:08.122 --> 00:17:09.592
I reckon, if he had his way,

00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:13.165
that land would be in a
similar state as this one.

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:17.173
[DOFLAMINGO]
The Navy. The Seven Warlords.

00:17:17.206 --> 00:17:20.246
The Four Emperors.

00:17:20.279 --> 00:17:23.152
What do you think will happen
to the balance of power?

00:17:23.185 --> 00:17:24.320
No clue.

00:17:24.354 --> 00:17:27.093
We won’t figure that out
till it’s demolished.

00:17:27.127 --> 00:17:29.632
However...

00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:31.034
Continue.

00:17:31.068 --> 00:17:34.508
[FUJITORA] If you keep up
this foolish reign of terror...

00:17:41.054 --> 00:17:43.660
[FUJITORA] ...the price on
your head will only increase.

00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:45.096
Heavenly Demon.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.635
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]
Did I mishear you?

00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:50.941
I though you said, "“Off me now
while you have the chance!"”

00:17:50.974 --> 00:17:52.644
[FUJITORA]
Let’s not be hasty.

00:17:52.678 --> 00:17:55.884
We can operate under
a gentleman’s agreement.

00:18:01.428 --> 00:18:04.568
My only objective is to
protect your kingdom.

00:18:04.602 --> 00:18:06.171
So any sort of "“rough edges"”

00:18:06.205 --> 00:18:08.475
that I may accidently
happen upon,

00:18:08.509 --> 00:18:11.014
I promise to turn
a blind eye to.

00:18:11.047 --> 00:18:15.557
And rest assured, that’s the
only kind of eye I have.

00:18:15.591 --> 00:18:18.095
Don’t forget that we have
the Reverie World Summit

00:18:18.129 --> 00:18:20.299
coming up this year.

00:18:27.514 --> 00:18:29.652
[FUJITORA] This world’s
going to be changing,

00:18:29.685 --> 00:18:32.089
whether you like it or not.

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:41.643
[LUFFY] Huh? So, wait?
You’re a princess? Ow!

00:18:41.676 --> 00:18:43.446
[ZORO]
Could you turn it down a little?

00:18:43.479 --> 00:18:47.186
[KIN’EMON] Then does that imply
that you're a Dressrosa royalty?

00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:51.461
[VIOLET]
I used to be.

00:18:51.494 --> 00:18:54.468
[LUFFY] Huh? If Rebecca's
the king’s granddaughter,

00:18:54.502 --> 00:18:56.906
that makes you what now?

00:18:56.939 --> 00:18:59.043
[VIOLET]
Rebecca is my niece.

00:19:08.997 --> 00:19:12.436
She’s the daughter of my
late older sister, Scarlet.

00:19:15.677 --> 00:19:18.148
[KIN’EMON] A hidden door!
Are you a ninja?

00:19:18.182 --> 00:19:20.353
[ZORO]
Now I’ve seen everything.

00:19:20.386 --> 00:19:23.693
[KIN’EMON] A princess and
a ninja! Remarkable!

00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:25.864
[VIOLET] By taking this route,
you can avoid being spotted

00:19:25.897 --> 00:19:28.770
at the main entrance.
Now follow me.

00:19:33.546 --> 00:19:35.583
[LUFFY gasping]

00:19:38.422 --> 00:19:42.129
[VIOLET] This is a secret escape
passage of the Riku Family.

00:19:42.163 --> 00:19:44.868
Not even Doflamingo
knows that it’s here.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.481
[KIN’EMON coughing]

00:19:51.515 --> 00:19:53.118
[KIN’EMON]
What is this comically large

00:19:53.152 --> 00:19:54.488
basket’s purpose?

00:19:54.522 --> 00:19:56.593
It’s a pulley for lifting cargo.

00:19:56.626 --> 00:19:58.162
Look up.

00:19:58.195 --> 00:19:59.297
[ZORO]
Hmm.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.802
Looks like it reaches
all the way up to the top.

00:20:01.836 --> 00:20:04.308
[KIN’EMON] And I spy
a fine staircase, as well!

00:20:04.341 --> 00:20:06.680
Now if you follow
the flight of steps up,

00:20:06.713 --> 00:20:10.352
you’ll reach the Rampart Tower
where the entrance is located.

00:20:12.357 --> 00:20:16.231
[ZORO] Uh... Luffy! How about
you make this easy on everyone

00:20:16.264 --> 00:20:19.337
and grab this boulder here
and shoot yourself up?

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.243
[KIN’EMON]
Oh, quite a novel solution!

00:20:22.276 --> 00:20:26.418
If you can bring the chains once
a-top and cascade back down,

00:20:26.451 --> 00:20:29.190
we can traverse
upwards with ease.

00:20:29.224 --> 00:20:31.629
That sounds like madness.

00:20:40.681 --> 00:20:41.516
I got it.

00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:42.250
[VIOLET gasps]

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:46.357
'‘Kay! Here goes!

00:20:46.391 --> 00:20:47.862
[ZORO]
Make it snappy, Luffy!

00:20:47.895 --> 00:20:50.366
[KIN’EMON] Please join us for
the ride upward, Madame Ninja.

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:52.538
No way... What?

00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:56.044
[CROWD cheering]

00:20:56.078 --> 00:21:01.254
[GYATS] The Corrida Colosseum
Battle Tournament continues on!

00:21:01.288 --> 00:21:04.027
At last! The final round!

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.565
[KOALA panting]

00:21:10.807 --> 00:21:14.582
[KOALA panting]

00:21:14.615 --> 00:21:16.417
Just in time!

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:40.634
Everyone in the
kingdom is watching

00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:43.506
as we lock the special
ring into place now!

00:21:43.539 --> 00:21:46.646
[CROWD cheering]

00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:48.983
[GYATS] For those needing a
refresher, the winner gets

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:51.287
to take home the coveted
Logia Fruit produced

00:21:51.321 --> 00:21:55.062
when "“Fire Fist"” Ace perished,
the Flame Flame Fruit!

00:21:55.096 --> 00:21:58.101
Who will take home
that fabulous grand prize?

00:21:58.134 --> 00:21:59.705
We will soon find out when our

00:21:59.739 --> 00:22:01.642
final five contenders
duke it out!

00:22:01.675 --> 00:22:04.582
[CROWD cheering]

00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:07.486
[SABO chuckles]

00:22:09.925 --> 00:22:12.797
Not gonna lie.
I’m pretty excited.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.039
[SABO] Well, let’s get
to it, Marine Colosseo!

00:22:17.073 --> 00:22:18.610
[BARTOLOMEO]
What did you call me?

00:22:18.643 --> 00:22:20.713
It’s Bartolomeo, man!

00:22:23.018 --> 00:22:26.458
Look! Our first contender
is marching in now!

00:22:26.491 --> 00:22:28.796
[CROWD cheering]

00:22:34.106 --> 00:22:35.643
[KOALA laughs]

00:22:41.054 --> 00:22:42.891
Oh, boy!

00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:46.566
It’s our surprise finalist,
and wayward wanderer,

00:22:46.599 --> 00:22:50.372
none other than Lucy!

00:22:50.405 --> 00:22:55.215
[CROWD cheering]

00:22:55.249 --> 00:22:58.021
[SABO] I hope you’re
watching over me, Ace!

00:23:14.688 --> 00:23:17.126
[NARRATOR] The final battle
to win the Flame Flame Fruit

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.495
is finally underway!

00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:21.502
The stalwart Diamante
comes face-to-face with Lucy,

00:23:21.535 --> 00:23:24.074
the man who is destined
to inherit Ace’s will.

00:23:24.107 --> 00:23:26.244
As the Colosseum
roars with excitement,

00:23:26.278 --> 00:23:28.616
the Don Quixote family
executive demonstrates

00:23:28.649 --> 00:23:30.452
the true extent of his power.

00:23:30.485 --> 00:23:32.089
[LUFFY]
On the next <i>One Piece</i>!

00:23:32.123 --> 00:23:35.630
"“The Final Round Starts!
Diamante the Hero Shows Up!"”

00:23:35.664 --> 00:23:38.301
I’m gonna be
King of the Pirates!
