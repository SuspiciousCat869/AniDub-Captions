[KAYA] You have to tell me
who did this to you.

He attacked me.

[MERRY] He got close to you just
so he could steal your fortune.

about yesterday was the truth.

That's right. And that's
what is most tragic.

When he learned the truth,

he tried his hardest
to get us to hear him out,

197
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,312
but we were all
too shallow‐minded,

We know the attack has yet
to begin, so be calm

what it is you have to do next.

can stop Klahadore now, Kaya.
