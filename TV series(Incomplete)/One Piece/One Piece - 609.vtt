00:13:30.242 --> 00:13:31.877
We've gotta help Mocha!

00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:35.247
Mil Fleurs. Gigantesco Mano!

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:40.352
I'll hold them off while
you go find the girl!

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:42.154
'Kay, thanks!

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:43.689
Get outta the way!

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:46.325
[BOYS grunt]

00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:49.962
[grunts] I'm afraid I can't hold
them off much longer.

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:51.096
[USOPP]
They sure are determined

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.265
to get their hands
on that stuff!

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:54.600
There she is!

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:57.603
[DOLAN]
Mocha!

00:13:57.636 --> 00:14:00.072
[SYND]
Give us candy!

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.231
[CHILDREN shout]

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:27.867
You can't have any! Can't you
see it's bad for you?

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.201
[CHILDREN]
Candy!

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:32.671
I'm telling you guys,
this is what's making us sick!

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.273
Look what it did to you!

00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:36.141
We asked Chopper and
his friends to help us

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:37.776
get out of this place, remember?

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.044
It's mine! Gimme!

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:42.514
No! We've gotta listen to them
or we'll never get back home!

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.350
It's no use, they're too strong!

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:45.851
Let go and run!

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.987
Ah! No, I can't!

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.155
[DOLAN] That's no fair!
We want some too!

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:52.391
Hey! Chase her!

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:56.795
Wait, Mocha! You can't eat
that piece all by yourself!

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:57.596
Share it with us!

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.864
[MOCHA]
I can't let them have it!

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:02.701
I wanna go home and I know
deep down they do, too!

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.274
[gasps]
What?

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:11.543
[CHILDREN grunt]

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:14.747
[USOPP shivers] So cold!
It's freezin' in here!

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:19.018
[MOCHA] The exit's blocked!
What should I do?

00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:22.821
[MONET chuckles] You don't have
to worry about a thing,

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.123
Mocha dear.

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:31.397
It's Monet!

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.798
Wait, who the hell is she?

00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:34.867
[USOPP yells]
It's her!

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.270
She's the crazy bird-woman
I told you guys about!

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:40.105
Monet, help me! Please!

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:44.043
Mocha. You shouldn't
hog all of the candy.

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:47.346
Be a nice girl and share it
with the others, okay?

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:48.614
[MOCHA]
Huh?

00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:59.158
[CHILDREN yell]

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:01.660
It seems the
winged-woman uses sorcery!

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:03.362
She's a Logia type?

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:05.564
So she's our enemy, huh?

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:07.366
[chuckles]

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.970
Monet? But why?

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:16.041
[chuckles]

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:24.717
So, do either one of you guys
know what happened to the boy?

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.018
[SUBORDINATE A]
A boy? Here?

00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:27.219
[GINKO]
Hm!

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:32.024
He went into the "secret room"

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.926
that nobody's
supposed to go into.

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:37.296
And then all of a sudden,
he turned into a little dragon.

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:39.298
His name is Momonosuke.

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:41.033
[SUBORDINATE B] A brat
who turned into a dragon?

00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:42.968
Uh! I mean "the boy"!

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:45.070
[SUBORDINATE A] How did you
know about that, young lady?

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:47.639
Well, to tell the truth,
I saw it all happen.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:50.109
But I decided not to tell
anybody about it 'cause

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:52.644
we weren't supposed
to be in there.

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:54.079
We came here on the same boat.

00:16:54.113 --> 00:16:55.948
When I saw him change,
it scared me.

00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:57.182
I'm worried about him.

00:16:58.183 --> 00:16:59.651
[SUBORDINATE B]
Oh, I see!

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:01.920
There's no need for you
to worry! He's fine!

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:03.856
[SUBORDINATE A] This laboratory
is big and it's got lots

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:05.591
of treatment rooms
scattered throughout it.

00:17:05.624 --> 00:17:07.626
He's just being kept in a
different part of the lab,

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:08.761
that's all.

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:12.464
Oh, really? Do you know if
he's had something to eat?

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:15.167
I dunno why, but he wouldn't
even touch his food.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.436
[SUBORDINATE B] Yeah, we got
him to start eating again.

00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:20.773
Don't you worry about him.
He's doing just fine now.

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:22.074
Listen, whatever you do,

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:24.710
don't tell anyone about the
boy or the "secret room".

00:17:24.743 --> 00:17:27.179
Not even the other kids.
It'll be our little secret.

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:28.380
[GINKO]
Okay!

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:35.421
[SUBORDINATE A] I can't believe
that one of the children

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:36.955
found out about it.

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:39.358
[SUBORDINATE B] We have to let
the Master know right away.

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.768
[CAESAR CLOWN] I never
thought I'd have to enter

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:53.172
this secret room,
much less make use of it.

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:09.888
[sighs] But right now,
I'm afraid it's the only option.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:11.123
Pity.

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:15.194
[CAESAR CLOWN] They just had
to go and ruin everything!

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.900
Oh, how I wish it had all
gone according to my plan.

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.969
It would've been
an amazing show!

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:27.739
One that's more befitting of the
world's greatest scientist.

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:31.009
But then they came along
and spoiled all the fun.

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:33.712
Straw Hat Luffy!
His pirate crew!

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:35.347
The Navy G-5!

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.783
And Trafalgar Law!

00:18:37.816 --> 00:18:40.686
They will regret it.
I'll make sure of that.

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:41.753
When I'm done with them,

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:43.989
they're going to wish
they'd been sent to hell!

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:47.493
Bow down to my
scientific prowess!

00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:51.597
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:56.635
[VERGO, LAW grunt]

00:19:00.772 --> 00:19:04.076
[grunts] Lemme guess,
you're pissed off because

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:07.212
your scheme has come
crashing down all around you.

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:10.516
This thing's really
important to you guys, huh?

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:12.417
It's a hunk of junk!

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:19.024
[groans]

00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:22.494
I would watch my mouth
if I were you, Law.

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:26.698
[yells]

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:28.967
Dammit...! Room!

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:32.504
Now, my heart! Come back to me!

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:35.474
[gasps]

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.771
[LAW groans]

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:16.215
[VERGO]
Hm?

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:18.183
Here's a Counter Shock!

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:34.933
[coughs]

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:43.342
[VERGO]
I have a message from Joker.

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:45.644
He said that it's "a shame."

00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:47.913
[LAW]
My attack didn't work!

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:50.382
[LAW] I knew exactly how to get
my heart back from Caesar,

00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:52.384
but I didn't expect
to see you here.

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.253
I should've guessed
you were his lackey.

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:58.023
Don't you have better
things to do? Well, Vergo?

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:01.793
Mr. Vergo!

00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:06.832
[LAW yells]

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:26.385
[yells]

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:34.493
[pants]

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:38.597
[VERGO] I'm kinda in
the middle of something.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.401
Does it have to be now...

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:44.236
...Vice Admiral Smoker?

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:51.410
Whatever.

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:54.379
Been meanin' to kill you,
might as well get it over with.

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:56.982
[grunts]

00:21:57.015 --> 00:22:00.085
[SMOKER] Go ahead and try!
The sooner the better.

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:02.421
I can only look at
trash for so long.

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:05.157
Before I have to... take it out.

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:09.961
[SMOKER] Especially
filthy pirates... like you.

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:19.671
[NARRATOR] While Smoker
is filler with rage

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:21.707
at the news of his subordinates,

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.743
Vergo confronts him
with powerful Haki.

00:22:24.776 --> 00:22:26.945
With the Navy's pride
and honor on the line,

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:29.047
the two titans
challenge one another

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:31.249
in an epic fight.

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:33.185
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:33.218 --> 00:22:37.222
"Fists Collide! A Battle
of the Two Vice Admirals!"

00:22:37.255 --> 00:22:39.958
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
