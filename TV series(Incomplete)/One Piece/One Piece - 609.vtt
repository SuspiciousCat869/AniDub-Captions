00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:05.008
â™ª Opening Song â™ª

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.099
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:42.068
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:47.307
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.876
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.113
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:54.948
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.383
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.986
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.156
[NARRATOR]
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.392
a boy whose body became rubber
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.596
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.500
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.705
[NARRATOR] After a series
of fierce battles,

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:20.573
the Straw Hat Pirates
have reached the waters

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:24.010
of the New World, ruled by
the Four Emperors.

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.579
Their first stop is
the island of Punk Hazard,

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:29.716
where they face off against the
mad scientist, Caesar Clown.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.318
Fleeing from his deadly weapon,
Land of the Dead,

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.387
they storm his laboratory.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.724
Their mission is to capture him,
free the children he imprisoned,

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:40.660
and escape the island.

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:43.596
But that's some gratitude,
after I took him in!

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.600
I treated that punk like a
brother and this is what I get?

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:50.069
A pity, huh?

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.671
Indeed it is.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:54.407
I know this will be
difficult for you, Vergo,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.043
but I need you to
take care of Law.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:03:01.848
Also, make it as cruel and
gruesome as you can manage.

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:04.217
I want him to suffer.

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:08.588
[LUFFY]
"Luffy Dies from Exposure?!

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.324
The Spine-chilling
Snow Woman Monet!

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:09.282
I can't help but feel like I've
been bitten by my very own dog.

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.116
Law.

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.417
[LAW gasps]

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.295
[VERGO] I'm afraid that you've
crossed the line this time, kid.

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:27.600
You're just too damn
smart for your own good.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:30.136
Know what's sad about
folks like you?

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:35.174
[VERGO]
They tend to die at a young age.

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:40.680
[VERGO] It'd be really
easy for me to kill you.

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:42.982
All I'd have to do is
crush your heart.

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:45.518
But you know what?
I'm not gonna do that.

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:49.722
'Cause that's no fun.
No, I wanna torment you.

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:53.393
I can't wait to wipe that
smart-ass look off your face,

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:55.862
and watch you tremble with fear.

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:01.200
[VERGO]
Just like last time!

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:06.939
[LAW gasps, groans]

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.675
[grunts]

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:09.909
[VERGO]
Hmph.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.484
[LAW groans]

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:25.958
Stand up, Law. You can't die
this early in the fight.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.428
[gasps]

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:36.235
Damn it! What the heck
does she want from me?

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:40.373
Hey! Lady! Show yourself!

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:43.076
I told you I won't let
you go after the Master!

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:44.277
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:49.082
Jeez, this thing again? Argh!

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:50.583
This'll be easy!

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:53.486
Gum-gum... Jet Pistol!

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:57.724
[LUFFY grunts]

00:05:57.757 --> 00:06:01.127
Aw, come on! Not another wall!

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.898
Gum-Gum... Jet Gatling!

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:10.937
[LUFFY yells]

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:16.976
[laughs]

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.880
[yells]

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:23.983
[LUFFY gasps]

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:30.289
[LUFFY] What? You've gotta
be kiddin' me!

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:33.493
Hey! What's the
big idea, bird-lady?

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:36.229
How do you like my
ten-layer igloo?

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:38.931
Quite a bit thicker than
the last one, isn't it?

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:41.300
You see, it's much harder to
break through the snow walls

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:44.237
when they're layered
on top of one another.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.339
You're just tryin' to
buy time, aren't ya?

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:47.774
This thing can't hold me!

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:49.008
[MONET]
You're right.

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:51.611
In fact, you could probably
break through all the snow walls

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:53.446
in a matter of seconds.

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.449
If you agree, then why
even bother?

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:00.753
[MONET] Ha! Don't get
so fired up, Straw Hat.

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.321
[LUFFY gasps]

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:04.590
[MONET chuckles]

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:07.693
There is no way that
I'm losing to you!

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:09.896
[MONET]
That's a good point.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:14.066
Struggle as I may, I have no
chance of ever beating you.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.334
[LUFFY gasps]

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:16.803
[MONET]
However...

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:21.974
...sometimes it's the smartest,
not the strongest,

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:23.342
who wins the fight.

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:25.445
[gasps]

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:34.754
[LUFFY gasps, shivers]

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:37.824
It's so cold. It's like
you're made of ice.

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:39.592
Let go of me!

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.995
[MONET]
You can't push me away.

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:45.097
Now that I've got
you in my embrace,

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:49.235
you no longer have the
strength to break free.

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:52.705
Slowly but surely, my icy
body will drain your power

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:54.640
until there's nothing left.

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:57.910
Eventually...
Your heart will freeze.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:03.115
Soon you'll fall asleep,
and then die.

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:23.135
[gasps]

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:28.708
[MONET]
Would you look at that?

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:31.310
It's snowing heavily
all around you.

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:36.983
[MONET] You're starting to
feel sleepy, aren't you?

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:40.820
Don't fight it.
Let it wash over you.

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:43.523
[LUFFY exhales]

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:47.193
[MONET]
It feels good, doesn't it?

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:56.969
[MONET]
Now, slowly close your eyes.

00:08:57.003 --> 00:09:00.072
There you go... Just relax.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.744
[MONET]
Good night.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.788
[ZORO]
You have got to get it together!

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:18.991
We're in the New World!
Stakes are high!

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.529
[gasps, grunts]

00:09:24.263 --> 00:09:25.431
[MONET gasps]

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.234
Jet Spear!

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.371
Through the floor?

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.273
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:40.413
[LUFFY gasps, shouts]

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.850
[LUFFY grunts]

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:47.954
[yells]

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:50.556
[MONET]
What tremendous power he has!

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.191
But that tumble is
going to land him

00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:53.993
in the trash shoot
which leads straight

00:09:54.026 --> 00:09:56.996
to the garbage dump
that's deep underground.

00:09:57.029 --> 00:10:00.733
He won't be able to make it up
here again, unless he can fly.

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:04.971
He dug his own grave,
so to speak. Mm-hm! So long!

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:06.238
[laughs]

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:11.277
[LUFFY yells]

00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:36.602
[CHILDREN]
Candy! We want candy!

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.638
Please, you've gotta
listen to me!

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:40.740
You can't eat anymore,
it's bad for you!

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:42.074
[KONBU]
Hand it over!

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:46.245
I know it's hard,
but resist the temptation!

00:10:46.278 --> 00:10:50.249
I need you to believe me!
You've gotta be strong!

00:10:50.282 --> 00:10:52.485
You're not getting
past me, kids.

00:10:52.518 --> 00:10:55.655
I'm not gonna let you go back
inside the Biscuit Room!

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:58.324
[BOY I]
We want it! Now!

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:02.995
[KONBU]
Let us through!

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:04.563
Gimme candy!

00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:06.599
[CHOPPER]
Stop right there!

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:09.168
Let go of me!
I just need a little bit!

00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:10.169
No, you can't!

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:11.837
Let go! You're hurting me!

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:13.706
[CHOPPER gasps]
Are you okay?

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:15.641
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to hurt you.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.144
Get outta our way, you monster!

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:20.346
We want our candy!

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:24.183
[CHOPPER grunts]

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:25.484
[CHOPPER]
This won't work.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.720
I can't stop them
without hurting them!

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:28.688
Here's our chance!

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:30.623
Get to the Biscuit Room!

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:33.526
No, stop!
Stay outta there, kids!

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.964
[CHOPPER] Uh-oh! The effects of
the Rumble Ball are wearing off!

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:41.600
Now we can eat all the candy!

00:11:43.569 --> 00:11:46.505
[grunts, shouts]

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:49.909
[GIRL A]
Candy!

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:52.111
[DOLAN] Hurry! Let's go back
to the Biscuit Room!

00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:54.447
[BIYO]
I can't wait to have some!

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.349
No! That stuff's bad for you!

00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:00.820
[grunts] What'll I do?
I'm so weak I can't move!

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:02.288
I'm stuck!

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:03.989
Don't eat the candy!

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:06.292
You can't ingest any
more of the drug!

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:09.662
If you do, it'll wreak
havoc on your bodies!

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:14.767
Everyone! Please! Listen!
I'm begging you!

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.636
You can't eat any more candy!

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.407
[CHOPPER] Dammit!
There's nothing I can do!

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.608
I wanna save them,

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:26.078
but I can't because I
don't have the strength.

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:28.447
[CHOPPER gasps]

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.150
Whoa! You okay?

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:35.821
Nami... Thank you!

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:39.458
[laughs] It looks like we got
here in the nick of time!

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:41.460
What in the hell's gotten
into those children?

00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:43.629
They've become even
more violent!

00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:46.432
Momonosuke! Where are you?

00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:48.601
[CHOPPER sobs]
I'm glad you're here!

00:12:48.634 --> 00:12:50.169
I can't handle them alone!

00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:52.071
Hey, wanna tell us
what's goin' on, buddy?

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:55.040
Caesar Clown's trying to turn
the poor children into giants,

00:12:55.074 --> 00:12:57.843
because he wants to them all
to become vicious soldiers.

00:12:57.877 --> 00:13:01.180
And he's doing it by giving
them drugged candy!

00:13:01.213 --> 00:13:03.315
You've gotta stop the kids
before they can consume

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:04.850
any more of it!

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:07.486
The Biscuit Room's down
the hall to the left!

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.122
That's where they get the candy!

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:12.591
There's a girl named Mocha
who's been helping me.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.528
She's the only child who's
in their right mind.

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:17.630
We've been working together
to keep the others from

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:20.866
getting back in the room,
but now she's in danger!

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.570
She's been protecting the candy
and she's all by herself!

00:13:24.603 --> 00:13:26.105
[CHILDREN]
Candy!

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:28.541
[SYND]
We made it! Ah!

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:30.209
Candy!

00:13:30.242 --> 00:13:31.877
We've gotta help Mocha!

00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:35.247
Mil Fleurs. Gigantesco Mano!

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:40.352
I'll hold them off while
you go find the girl!

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:42.154
'Kay, thanks!

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:43.689
Get outta the way!

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:46.325
[BOYS grunt]

00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:49.962
[grunts] I'm afraid I can't hold
them off much longer.

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:51.096
[USOPP]
They sure are determined

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.265
to get their hands
on that stuff!

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:54.600
There she is!

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:57.603
[DOLAN]
Mocha!

00:13:57.636 --> 00:14:00.072
[SYND]
Give us candy!

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.231
[CHILDREN shout]

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:27.867
You can't have any! Can't you
see it's bad for you?

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.201
[CHILDREN]
Candy!

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:32.671
I'm telling you guys,
this is what's making us sick!

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.273
Look what it did to you!

00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:36.141
We asked Chopper and
his friends to help us

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:37.776
get out of this place, remember?

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.044
It's mine! Gimme!

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:42.514
No! We've gotta listen to them
or we'll never get back home!

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.350
It's no use, they're too strong!

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:45.851
Let go and run!

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.987
Ah! No, I can't!

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.155
[DOLAN] That's no fair!
We want some too!

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:52.391
Hey! Chase her!

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:56.795
Wait, Mocha! You can't eat
that piece all by yourself!

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:57.596
Share it with us!

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.864
[MOCHA]
I can't let them have it!

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:02.701
I wanna go home and I know
deep down they do, too!

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.274
[gasps]
What?

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:11.543
[CHILDREN grunt]

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:14.747
[USOPP shivers] So cold!
It's freezin' in here!

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:19.018
[MOCHA] The exit's blocked!
What should I do?

00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:22.821
[MONET chuckles] You don't have
to worry about a thing,

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.123
Mocha dear.

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:31.397
It's Monet!

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.798
Wait, who the hell is she?

00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:34.867
[USOPP yells]
It's her!

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.270
She's the crazy bird-woman
I told you guys about!

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:40.105
Monet, help me! Please!

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:44.043
Mocha. You shouldn't
hog all of the candy.

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:47.346
Be a nice girl and share it
with the others, okay?

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:48.614
[MOCHA]
Huh?

00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:59.158
[CHILDREN yell]

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:01.660
It seems the
winged-woman uses sorcery!

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:03.362
She's a Logia type?

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:05.564
So she's our enemy, huh?

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:07.366
[chuckles]

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.970
Monet? But why?

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:16.041
[chuckles]

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:24.717
So, do either one of you guys
know what happened to the boy?

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.018
[SUBORDINATE A]
A boy? Here?

00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:27.219
[GINKO]
Hm!

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:32.024
He went into the "secret room"

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.926
that nobody's
supposed to go into.

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:37.296
And then all of a sudden,
he turned into a little dragon.

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:39.298
His name is Momonosuke.

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:41.033
[SUBORDINATE B] A brat
who turned into a dragon?

00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:42.968
Uh! I mean "the boy"!

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:45.070
[SUBORDINATE A] How did you
know about that, young lady?

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:47.639
Well, to tell the truth,
I saw it all happen.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:50.109
But I decided not to tell
anybody about it 'cause

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:52.644
we weren't supposed
to be in there.

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:54.079
We came here on the same boat.

00:16:54.113 --> 00:16:55.948
When I saw him change,
it scared me.

00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:57.182
I'm worried about him.

00:16:58.183 --> 00:16:59.651
[SUBORDINATE B]
Oh, I see!

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:01.920
There's no need for you
to worry! He's fine!

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:03.856
[SUBORDINATE A] This laboratory
is big and it's got lots

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:05.591
of treatment rooms
scattered throughout it.

00:17:05.624 --> 00:17:07.626
He's just being kept in a
different part of the lab,

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:08.761
that's all.

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:12.464
Oh, really? Do you know if
he's had something to eat?

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:15.167
I dunno why, but he wouldn't
even touch his food.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.436
[SUBORDINATE B] Yeah, we got
him to start eating again.

00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:20.773
Don't you worry about him.
He's doing just fine now.

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:22.074
Listen, whatever you do,

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:24.710
don't tell anyone about the
boy or the "secret room".

00:17:24.743 --> 00:17:27.179
Not even the other kids.
It'll be our little secret.

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:28.380
[GINKO]
Okay!

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:35.421
[SUBORDINATE A] I can't believe
that one of the children

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:36.955
found out about it.

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:39.358
[SUBORDINATE B] We have to let
the Master know right away.

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.768
[CAESAR CLOWN] I never
thought I'd have to enter

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:53.172
this secret room,
much less make use of it.

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:09.888
[sighs] But right now,
I'm afraid it's the only option.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:11.123
Pity.

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:15.194
[CAESAR CLOWN] They just had
to go and ruin everything!

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.900
Oh, how I wish it had all
gone according to my plan.

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.969
It would've been
an amazing show!

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:27.739
One that's more befitting of the
world's greatest scientist.

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:31.009
But then they came along
and spoiled all the fun.

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:33.712
Straw Hat Luffy!
His pirate crew!

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:35.347
The Navy G-5!

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.783
And Trafalgar Law!

00:18:37.816 --> 00:18:40.686
They will regret it.
I'll make sure of that.

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:41.753
When I'm done with them,

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:43.989
they're going to wish
they'd been sent to hell!

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:47.493
Bow down to my
scientific prowess!

00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:51.597
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:56.635
[VERGO, LAW grunt]

00:19:00.772 --> 00:19:04.076
[grunts] Lemme guess,
you're pissed off because

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:07.212
your scheme has come
crashing down all around you.

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:10.516
This thing's really
important to you guys, huh?

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:12.417
It's a hunk of junk!

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:19.024
[groans]

00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:22.494
I would watch my mouth
if I were you, Law.

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:26.698
[yells]

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:28.967
Dammit...! Room!

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:32.504
Now, my heart! Come back to me!

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:35.474
[gasps]

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.771
[LAW groans]

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:16.215
[VERGO]
Hm?

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:18.183
Here's a Counter Shock!

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:34.933
[coughs]

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:43.342
[VERGO]
I have a message from Joker.

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:45.644
He said that it's "a shame."

00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:47.913
[LAW]
My attack didn't work!

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:50.382
[LAW] I knew exactly how to get
my heart back from Caesar,

00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:52.384
but I didn't expect
to see you here.

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.253
I should've guessed
you were his lackey.

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:58.023
Don't you have better
things to do? Well, Vergo?

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:01.793
Mr. Vergo!

00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:06.832
[LAW yells]

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:26.385
[yells]

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:34.493
[pants]

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:38.597
[VERGO] I'm kinda in
the middle of something.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.401
Does it have to be now...

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:44.236
...Vice Admiral Smoker?

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:51.410
Whatever.

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:54.379
Been meanin' to kill you,
might as well get it over with.

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:56.982
[grunts]

00:21:57.015 --> 00:22:00.085
[SMOKER] Go ahead and try!
The sooner the better.

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:02.421
I can only look at
trash for so long.

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:05.157
Before I have to... take it out.

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:09.961
[SMOKER] Especially
filthy pirates... like you.

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:19.671
[NARRATOR] While Smoker
is filler with rage

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:21.707
at the news of his subordinates,

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.743
Vergo confronts him
with powerful Haki.

00:22:24.776 --> 00:22:26.945
With the Navy's pride
and honor on the line,

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:29.047
the two titans
challenge one another

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:31.249
in an epic fight.

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:33.185
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:33.218 --> 00:22:37.222
"Fists Collide! A Battle
of the Two Vice Admirals!"

00:22:37.255 --> 00:22:39.958
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
