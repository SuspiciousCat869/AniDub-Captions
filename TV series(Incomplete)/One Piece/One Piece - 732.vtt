00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:37.515
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:40.420
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.487 --> 00:02:45.732
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.303
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:51.543
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.446
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:55.952
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.018 --> 00:02:58.758
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.166
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:04.669
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.736 --> 00:03:08.342
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.819
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:20.367
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:23.641
and targeted the Don Quixote
Family in Dressrosa.

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:26.981
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:27.048 --> 00:03:29.586
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:30.287 --> 00:03:32.291
[NARRATOR] In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:34.162
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:34.228 --> 00:03:36.366
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives,

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:40.040
until at last,
only their leader remained.

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:44.683
[DOFLAMINGO] I don't punish my
associates for their failures.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.352
I forgive them.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.761
But betrayals are
another matter, entirely.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.636
[VIOLET gasps]

00:03:57.642 --> 00:03:58.844
[VIOLET]
No!

00:03:59.713 --> 00:04:04.689
[REBECCA]
My body... I can't control it!

00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:07.628
[chuckles]

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.733
[NARRATOR]
The razer-sharp threads

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.270
of Doflamingo's "Birdcage"
tear across Dressrosa,

00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:15.076
threatening to massacre
everyone in the kingdom.

00:04:15.143 --> 00:04:16.948
Luffy rushes to
defeat Doflamingo

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:18.116
before it's too late,

00:04:18.183 --> 00:04:19.820
but exhausts his Haki
in the process,

00:04:19.886 --> 00:04:23.627
leaving his allies to
temporarily fend for themselves.

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:27.768
Buy me ten minutes.

00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:31.142
Huh? What for?

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:33.179
[LUFFY]
Once my Haki comes back,

00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:35.284
I'll give him one good punch,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.256
and that'll be
the end of him. I promise.

00:04:38.323 --> 00:04:40.794
Tell me! Do you really
think, in ten minutes,

00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:44.334
you can beat Doflamingo
and get rid of the Birdcage?

00:04:48.143 --> 00:04:50.346
I know I can!

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.693
[LUFFY] "Dead or Alive!
A Fateful Countdown!"

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:04.409
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:07.782
We're almost there,
guys! Don't give up!

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.961
C'mon! Take my hand!
We're all gonna make it!

00:05:19.272 --> 00:05:21.375
We stopped it once, didn't we?

00:05:21.442 --> 00:05:23.480
We'll do it again if we have to!

00:05:23.548 --> 00:05:25.651
Let's pull out all the stops!

00:05:25.718 --> 00:05:28.558
[KIN'EMON grunts] We must honor
Sir Luffy's great efforts

00:05:28.624 --> 00:05:30.127
with equal conviction!

00:05:30.193 --> 00:05:33.901
We shall show the world
our pride as Samurai of Wano!

00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:36.339
And we're gonna show 'em
the strength of the Navy!

00:05:36.406 --> 00:05:37.441
[MARINES grunt]

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.979
[ALL grunting]

00:05:49.131 --> 00:05:52.471
Keep pushing! Let's go!

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.945
[ALL grunting]

00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:02.826
[BARTOLOMEO]
Every second.

00:06:02.893 --> 00:06:05.631
Every inch that we
give to this wall

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:08.069
pushes us closer to our defeat.

00:06:08.136 --> 00:06:12.278
It pushes us closer to our
death--to everyone's death!

00:06:12.344 --> 00:06:14.616
You gotta remember
what's at stake here!

00:06:14.682 --> 00:06:17.120
Either you push or you die!

00:06:17.187 --> 00:06:19.425
You're not helping!
Just shut up!

00:06:19.492 --> 00:06:21.563
You don't have to
tell us, we know!

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.570
We all came here to fight,
so we're not afraid to die!

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:26.774
Our lives were saved, twice!

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.581
Fighting to the death,
that's the least that we can do!

00:06:30.648 --> 00:06:32.051
Aw! You're so sweet!

00:06:32.117 --> 00:06:33.987
Hey, don't cuddle me!

00:06:34.054 --> 00:06:35.558
[HAJRUDIN]
Indeed.

00:06:35.624 --> 00:06:39.766
But this will not be
my grave! Nor yours!

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:45.109
I won't quit till I
achieve my destiny!

00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:48.483
[BARTOLOMEO]
Then we'll keep pushing

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.460
till we reach our limit,
and then we'll push some more!

00:06:53.527 --> 00:06:56.567
We all got too many dreams
to give up now!

00:06:56.633 --> 00:06:59.806
No way we're gonna die!

00:06:59.873 --> 00:07:06.886
[ALL yelling]

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:16.707
Stay safe. Everybody, please.

00:07:16.774 --> 00:07:19.712
We've all seen enough suffering.

00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:25.858
[ATTENDANT B]
Are you okay?

00:07:25.925 --> 00:07:27.762
[ATTENDANT A]
Catch your breath.

00:07:32.705 --> 00:07:36.345
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:07:36.412 --> 00:07:37.615
[VIOLET]
Leave her alone!

00:07:37.682 --> 00:07:39.519
This battle's between
you and me!

00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:44.462
I can't... I can't stop it!

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:46.332
Viola!

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.535
Keep fighting it!

00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:51.075
Very good. Now kill Violet.

00:07:57.187 --> 00:07:59.125
I'm so sorry!

00:07:59.192 --> 00:08:00.628
I don't want this!

00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:02.898
But he's too strong!

00:08:04.034 --> 00:08:04.936
Rebecca!

00:08:05.003 --> 00:08:07.742
[chuckles]

00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:21.102
[REBECCA]
No! I hate this!

00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:23.707
I don't want to hurt Viola!

00:08:28.183 --> 00:08:31.055
[REBECCA cries]
Stop!

00:08:31.122 --> 00:08:32.858
You let her go!

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.367
No!

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:40.674
[audio feedback]

00:08:40.741 --> 00:08:43.747
[GYATS]
Are you ready, everybody?

00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:47.788
It won't be much longer, now!

00:08:49.859 --> 00:08:50.961
Huh?

00:08:51.028 --> 00:08:53.132
[TOWNSMAN C]
Huh? Who's talking?

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:57.240
[GYATS panting]

00:08:59.345 --> 00:09:01.216
Where's that coming from?

00:09:01.282 --> 00:09:03.086
Is it some kind of PA?

00:09:03.152 --> 00:09:06.527
Our hero is on his way!

00:09:06.594 --> 00:09:09.766
Hey! There he is!

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:13.707
[panting]

00:09:13.774 --> 00:09:15.611
[TOWNSMAN F]
That's Gyats, isn't it?

00:09:15.678 --> 00:09:17.949
The announcer from the Coliseum?

00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:19.619
[TOWNSMAN D]
What're you doing up there?

00:09:19.686 --> 00:09:21.623
[TOWNSMAN E]
He's lost it!

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.058
[GYATS]
Surely, you remember him!

00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.665
[TOWNSMAN F] Whatever this is,
now is not the time!

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.902
[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

00:09:27.969 --> 00:09:30.608
The whole kingdom's
about be destroyed, y'know!

00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:33.980
We'd rather hear from King Riku!

00:09:34.047 --> 00:09:37.655
What's that?
I need to remind you?

00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:39.191
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:09:39.258 --> 00:09:42.798
[GYATS] Unpredictable in nature
and irrepressible in spirit.

00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:46.005
He burst onto the scene,
and more importantly,

00:09:46.072 --> 00:09:48.042
into our hearts!

00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:51.683
The hero who lit up the coliseum
like a shining star!

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.954
Shining star?

00:09:54.021 --> 00:09:56.994
There's only one answer, surely!

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.197
He means me!

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:01.069
[chuckles]

00:10:01.135 --> 00:10:03.774
Hey. I know I said
I'd stay here with you,

00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:08.584
but, well, it turns out,
my fans need me.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.588
Sorry--huh?!

00:10:10.655 --> 00:10:12.424
Hello? Trafalgar!

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.394
What? Where did he go?

00:10:16.431 --> 00:10:21.677
His courage rocked my soul!

00:10:21.744 --> 00:10:24.047
He tamed the savage bull
that struck fear

00:10:24.114 --> 00:10:26.385
into the hearts
of all gladiators!

00:10:26.452 --> 00:10:28.924
His fearsome fists
felled a giant!

00:10:28.991 --> 00:10:31.763
Even the living legend,
Don Chin Jao,

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.667
faltered before his might!

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:35.269
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:36.806
[GYATS]
Though small in stature,

00:10:36.873 --> 00:10:39.612
his energy was felt through
all of the coliseum--

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:42.284
No! Through all of Dressrosa!

00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:44.555
A man who was born to be free.

00:10:44.622 --> 00:10:46.225
Who fought fervidly!

00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:49.331
Who struck a chord
in our hearts, brilliantly!

00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:53.205
Now are you with me?

00:10:53.272 --> 00:10:56.479
Yeah. I saw him. That guy.

00:10:56.546 --> 00:10:58.216
He was pretty amazing.

00:10:58.282 --> 00:10:59.686
He blew me away, too!

00:10:59.753 --> 00:11:02.491
Everyone in the city
was watching him fight!

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:04.896
You know his name!

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:08.871
Lucy!

00:11:08.937 --> 00:11:10.541
What are you getting at?

00:11:10.607 --> 00:11:13.880
How is a gladiator
supposed to save us now?

00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:20.794
[REBECCA]
Lucy. Please, help me!

00:11:20.861 --> 00:11:23.099
[GYATS]
But Lucy was only an alias!

00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:27.374
That's right! He has another
name you don't know!

00:11:27.441 --> 00:11:28.476
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:30.747
[GYATS]
Would you like to hear it?

00:11:35.557 --> 00:11:39.565
He's a pirate
known as Straw Hat!

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:41.870
Monkey D. Luffy!

00:11:41.937 --> 00:11:43.339
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:11:43.406 --> 00:11:46.278
Huh? He sure had me
fooled with that beard!

00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:49.619
That's the guy King Riku was
talking about before, right?

00:11:49.686 --> 00:11:51.756
[GYATS]
I understand your reservations.

00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:54.529
You must be wary about
trusting another pirate

00:11:54.596 --> 00:11:56.265
when Doflamingo has been lying

00:11:56.332 --> 00:11:59.204
and grinding us under
his heel for so long.

00:11:59.271 --> 00:12:02.911
However, he's different
from the Don Quixote Family,

00:12:02.978 --> 00:12:06.252
who tried to pass themselves off
as our saviors that night,

00:12:06.319 --> 00:12:07.822
so many years ago.

00:12:07.888 --> 00:12:09.893
You don't have to trust me!

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.099
Instead, listen to King Riku,

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:16.873
who placed his faith
in Straw Hat Luffy!

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.013
Straw Hat has already
clashed with Doflamingo once

00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:23.219
and brought him within
an inch of defeat!

00:12:23.286 --> 00:12:25.022
He looked kind of
scrawny though.

00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:29.030
I mean, he did kick
a lot of ass in the coliseum.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:31.168
[TOWNSWOMAN A]
I believe in him.

00:12:31.235 --> 00:12:32.437
[TOWNSMEN]
Huh?

00:12:32.504 --> 00:12:35.578
I do. I won't give up hope.

00:12:35.644 --> 00:12:36.747
[TOWNSMAN N]
Me, too!

00:12:36.813 --> 00:12:39.051
This is our fault, you know.

00:12:39.118 --> 00:12:41.523
Because we didn't
trust our king.

00:12:41.589 --> 00:12:44.395
We believed Doflamingo.

00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:46.966
But not this time, damn it!

00:12:50.273 --> 00:12:51.375
I'll have faith.

00:12:51.442 --> 00:12:53.179
In King Riku.

00:12:53.246 --> 00:12:55.383
And in Lucy, too.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.190
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
I'll have faith in our future!

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.170
[GYATS] This is the calm
before the storm!

00:13:05.237 --> 00:13:06.973
Lucy is taking
a breather right now,

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.978
in preparation for round two,

00:13:09.044 --> 00:13:12.250
but he's going to
come back even stronger!

00:13:12.316 --> 00:13:16.526
So raise your hands
in celebration, Dressrosa!

00:13:18.195 --> 00:13:23.072
[GYATS] Because I spoke to
Lucy, and he made me a promise!

00:13:27.815 --> 00:13:30.854
He'll face Doflamingo.

00:13:38.637 --> 00:13:43.046
And knock him out in one punch!

00:13:43.112 --> 00:13:49.458
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:13:49.525 --> 00:13:53.432
[yells]

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:21.421
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:27.000
[chuckles]

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:29.170
In one punch, you say?

00:14:29.237 --> 00:14:32.912
[CHIN JAO chuckles]
He sure talks big!

00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:38.388
[cries] Mister Luffy
is number one! Sucker!

00:14:40.193 --> 00:14:43.265
[USOPP laughs]
Typical Luffy!

00:14:44.033 --> 00:14:46.071
[ZORO] Glad you're making
this quick, Captain.

00:14:46.138 --> 00:14:49.310
'Cause I'm slipping. Real fast!

00:14:51.014 --> 00:14:57.293
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.672
I can't wait!

00:15:02.738 --> 00:15:04.474
Lucy!

00:15:15.931 --> 00:15:21.475
Hey, Doflamingo! You hear that?

00:15:21.543 --> 00:15:23.547
You phony!

00:15:23.614 --> 00:15:24.982
Cheating our King.

00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:27.187
Filling our streets with lies!

00:15:27.254 --> 00:15:29.190
Sitting on a misbegotten throne

00:15:29.257 --> 00:15:31.963
built on a mountain
of injustice!

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.769
But now you must
face your trial!

00:15:34.835 --> 00:15:37.107
Your cruelty ends today!

00:15:37.173 --> 00:15:42.050
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:15:42.116 --> 00:15:43.953
[DOFLAMINGO]
Gyats.

00:15:45.156 --> 00:15:47.160
[GYATS]
That's right, Doflamingo.

00:15:47.226 --> 00:15:49.799
I see straight through you!

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:52.203
If you're mad,
come and get me!

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:56.244
Keep your filthy hands
off Viola and Rebecca!

00:15:58.148 --> 00:16:02.023
Thanks to your hard work,
the Birdcage was slowed down,

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.862
and countless lives were saved!

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:08.870
And soon enough,
the coliseum's shining star,

00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:11.776
our Lucy, will take the stage!

00:16:11.842 --> 00:16:16.620
Let's show him how we feel
and give the man a cheer!

00:16:16.686 --> 00:16:23.498
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:16:26.104 --> 00:16:31.214
For Mister Luffy! Let's go!

00:16:33.954 --> 00:16:36.291
[HAJRUDIN grunting]

00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:44.207
[TOWNSMAN R]
Hajrudin!

00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:47.648
No! Damn it!

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:50.252
We were so close.

00:16:52.457 --> 00:16:53.492
What's wrong?

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.798
It's like their injuries
came back all of sudden.

00:16:55.864 --> 00:16:57.267
They're dropping like flies!

00:16:57.333 --> 00:16:58.870
'Cause time has run out.

00:16:58.937 --> 00:17:00.039
[ROBIN gasps]

00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:01.242
These people were
the ones who were

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:02.945
given the Dandilixers first.

00:17:03.011 --> 00:17:04.447
And now they're wearing off.

00:17:04.515 --> 00:17:06.586
And they aren't
gonna work twice!

00:17:06.653 --> 00:17:07.855
[ROBIN gasps]

00:17:07.922 --> 00:17:11.294
[MANSHERRY cries] I'm sorry,
that's the best I can do!

00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:14.802
I tried, but my ability
just isn't good enough!

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.606
I did such an awful thing!

00:17:16.672 --> 00:17:19.512
I gave them hope,
then I yanked it away!

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.983
[CUB] That's not true,
Princess Mansherry!

00:17:22.049 --> 00:17:24.454
If it wasn't for your help,
there's no telling

00:17:24.522 --> 00:17:28.128
just how many lives the Birdcage
might have claimed today!

00:17:28.195 --> 00:17:29.999
--[MANSHERRY] But...
--Do you see?

00:17:30.066 --> 00:17:31.235
Huh?

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:34.207
[CUB] You made a miracle
happen down there!

00:17:34.876 --> 00:17:37.782
Hey! C'mon! Don't give up!

00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:39.150
Clear out the injured

00:17:39.217 --> 00:17:41.188
and have the people in
the back take their place!

00:17:41.254 --> 00:17:43.693
Bring in some fresh troops!

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.962
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Roger!

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:47.166
[SAI] We'll hold
our ground at any cost,

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:50.339
until Lucy gets rid of
the Birdcage for good!

00:17:50.406 --> 00:17:53.279
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Yeah!

00:17:53.345 --> 00:17:55.483
They were able to
stall it long enough!

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.291
Thanks to you, they'll survive
till Luffyland returns!

00:17:59.357 --> 00:18:01.194
[gasps]

00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:03.099
[GYATS]
It won't be long now!

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:07.006
Let's begin the countdown
to Lucy's comeback!

00:18:07.073 --> 00:18:09.612
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheer]

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:11.114
Call out his name!

00:18:11.181 --> 00:18:15.323
Make sure he can hear us!

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.730
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Lucy! Lucy!

00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:25.109
Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy...

00:18:32.323 --> 00:18:38.636
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy...

00:18:54.768 --> 00:19:01.414
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy...

00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:09.364
Count from three!

00:19:10.432 --> 00:19:11.569
[gasps]

00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:17.179
[GYATS, TOWNSPEOPLE]
Two!

00:19:21.255 --> 00:19:23.392
[ATTENDANTS scream]

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.368
You had your fun. That's enough.

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:29.972
--[ATTENDANT A] He's hit! Oh no!
--[ATTENDANT B] Gyats, no!

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:32.978
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Lucy! Lucy!

00:19:33.045 --> 00:19:37.788
Don't stop! Almost there!

00:19:37.854 --> 00:19:39.625
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
One!

00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:41.662
What a joke.

00:19:41.729 --> 00:19:45.002
[GYATS]
Your time's up, Doflamingo.

00:19:45.069 --> 00:19:48.342
Lucy's gonna knock you out cold!

00:19:48.408 --> 00:19:51.782
One punch and you're toast!

00:19:56.191 --> 00:20:00.233
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Zero!

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:07.480
[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.693
[TOWNSMAN X]
Hello? Lucy?

00:20:16.064 --> 00:20:20.173
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
What a pity!

00:20:20.239 --> 00:20:22.744
Guess Straw Hat's done!

00:20:22.811 --> 00:20:29.758
[cackles]

00:20:30.727 --> 00:20:34.300
Well, things finally
quieted down.

00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:45.489
And now, you can go quiet, too.

00:20:46.425 --> 00:20:49.430
Forever, that is.

00:20:49.497 --> 00:20:52.403
No!

00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:00.554
I'm sorry, Viola!

00:21:00.621 --> 00:21:03.526
Quick, Rebecca! Close your eyes!

00:21:03.593 --> 00:21:05.362
You don't have to see a thing!

00:21:05.429 --> 00:21:07.701
This is just a bad dream!

00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:11.141
Once it's over, you can
strike it from your memory!

00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:12.443
I'll forgive you!

00:21:12.511 --> 00:21:15.449
All that matters
is that you move on!

00:21:15.517 --> 00:21:18.121
Please, be happy!

00:21:18.188 --> 00:21:19.591
[chuckles]

00:21:21.094 --> 00:21:23.431
Stop it!

00:21:23.498 --> 00:21:27.440
Don't be upset.
It's not your fault!

00:21:27.508 --> 00:21:29.845
[VIOLET] I'm sorry I have to
leave you like this.

00:21:29.912 --> 00:21:31.181
I know it will hurt.

00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:33.986
I know it won't be
easy to overcome.

00:21:37.928 --> 00:21:42.771
[REBECCA]
No!

00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:48.683
[REBECCA cries]

00:21:59.738 --> 00:22:01.074
[gasps]

00:22:03.847 --> 00:22:08.388
[LUFFY yells]

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:15.135
Get back!

00:22:17.641 --> 00:22:21.783
Our champion is here!

00:22:21.849 --> 00:22:25.322
Lucy! [sobs]

00:22:25.389 --> 00:22:30.466
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheer]

00:22:30.533 --> 00:22:37.012
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy...

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.324
[NARRATOR] His strength renewed,
Luffy charged forth

00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:18.328
into the final battle
with Doflamingo.

00:23:18.395 --> 00:23:20.232
Turning his surroundings
into weapons,

00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:22.470
Doflamingo momentarily
overwhelms Luffy

00:23:22.538 --> 00:23:24.006
and takes control of his body.

00:23:24.073 --> 00:23:27.514
But even a mighty Warlord cannot
contain the power of Fourth Gear

00:23:27.581 --> 00:23:30.419
and a blow that carries the
hopes of an entire kingdom.

00:23:30.486 --> 00:23:32.090
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.156 --> 00:23:36.832
"Attack on a Celestial!
Luffy's King Kong Gun of Anger!"

00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:39.838
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
