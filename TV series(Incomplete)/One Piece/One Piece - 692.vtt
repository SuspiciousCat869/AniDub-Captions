must brave the second half

00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:45.865
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:48.437
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.677
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.581
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.614 --> 00:02:56.086
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:58.924
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:03.466
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:20.601
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:23.440
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:26.179
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.212 --> 00:03:28.551
In response, Doflamingo
trapped the kingdom inside

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:30.420
a barrier known as
the "Birdcage"

00:03:30.453 --> 00:03:32.525
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:32.558 --> 00:03:34.829
Amidst the chaos, he also
put prices on the heads

00:03:34.863 --> 00:03:38.236
of Luffy and his allies, turning
the entire kingdom against them.

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.639
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:42.177
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:44.315
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:46.486
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.726
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE AC] But
now they're one hell of a team!

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.297
Okay, ignore that and
keep running like this,

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:53.901
straight up to the palace!

00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:55.605
Go, horse!

00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:54.722
[rattling]

00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:06.446
They look a bit like
toys, don't they?

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.285
I'd hate to see the
child they belong to.

00:05:09.318 --> 00:05:11.523
Ghastly things.

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:18.804

[LUFFY]
Oh! One of 'em fell over!

00:05:53.674 --> 00:05:56.145

If we hadn't moved, that thing
would've chewed my head off!

Who's that?

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.836
He's a Top Executive
from the Family,

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:50.541
with the same rank
as Trebol and Diamante.

00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:52.044

Looks like our enemy ran away.

Hey, buddy, I don't blame you
if you're pissin' your pants.

00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:22.505
Mister Zoro's a
certified badass, after all.

00:08:22.539 --> 00:08:24.710
Crap! He tricked us!

00:08:24.743 --> 00:08:27.715
You won't get to the palace!

nearly that big!

[ZORO] There's something
I forgot to tell you.

You've underestimated
the Straw Hats.

ones you need to worry about.

00:14:56.158 --> 00:14:59.532
He's tricking us!
You can't listen, Chao!

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:00.500
Huh?

00:15:00.534 --> 00:15:01.836
C'mon.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.509
Let's put this business behind
us and get back to work, okay?

00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:05.844
Huh? Ah!

00:15:05.878 --> 00:15:09.485
I put in earplugs, so I can't
hear your nasty lies anymore!

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:10.353
[grunts]

00:15:10.386 --> 00:15:11.021
[gasps]

00:15:11.054 --> 00:15:13.058
[CHAO]
Tontatta Swing!

00:15:13.092 --> 00:15:15.363
[SMILE OVERSEER C screams]

00:15:15.396 --> 00:15:16.264
[CHAO yells]

00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:19.238
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES
stammer, groan]

00:15:19.271 --> 00:15:20.206
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE Z gasp]

00:15:20.239 --> 00:15:21.576
Call the young master, hurry!

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.981
Uh, okay!

00:15:24.014 --> 00:15:26.753
[DWARVES]
You guys better not!

00:15:26.786 --> 00:15:28.590
Tontatta Tail...

00:15:28.624 --> 00:15:30.761
...Four-man Hammer!

00:15:30.794 --> 00:15:32.732
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES
gasp, groan]

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.502
[DWARF A]
Hmm. Okay!

00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:36.706
Let's release their
Transponder Snails!

00:15:36.739 --> 00:15:40.614
If we do that, they won't be
able to call for backup anymore!

00:15:41.683 --> 00:15:43.085
Are you paying attention?!

00:15:43.118 --> 00:15:44.454
[DWARVES]
Huh?

00:15:44.487 --> 00:15:45.089
[DWARVES]
Huh?

00:15:45.122 --> 00:15:46.959
[DWARVES]
Huh?

00:15:48.763 --> 00:15:50.399
Your earplugs!

00:15:55.744 --> 00:15:59.384
Okay, team. Get that door open!

00:15:59.418 --> 00:16:01.990
[MOUJI]
What?! How can it be?

00:16:02.023 --> 00:16:03.192
You mean all this time,

00:16:03.225 --> 00:16:06.298
Princess Mansherry
was never sick at all?

00:16:06.331 --> 00:16:08.068
[DWARF H]
Inhel told us.

00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:11.108
[MOUJI] I was such a fool!
We've been hoodwinked!

00:16:11.142 --> 00:16:13.781
Bamboozled! Hornswoggled!

00:16:13.814 --> 00:16:15.584
Where is the princess?!

00:16:15.617 --> 00:16:16.451
Well, uh...

00:16:16.484 --> 00:16:18.022
Everyone split up
to look for her.

00:16:18.055 --> 00:16:19.158
[MOUJI]
She's that way?

00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:20.728
I'm coming for you Princess!

00:16:20.761 --> 00:16:23.900
[DWARVES]
Hey! Wait a second!

00:16:23.933 --> 00:16:26.071
I'm pleased to know
her illness was a lie,

00:16:26.104 --> 00:16:27.675
but to think that
she's been alone

00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:30.046
all this time in the factory.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.916
How sad she must be!

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.754
Princess, your loyal
Mouji understands!

00:16:33.787 --> 00:16:35.289
[DWARVES]
Come back!

00:16:35.322 --> 00:16:37.728
I can practically see
the tears on your cheeks!

00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:41.068
Why, I can practically
hear you calling out my name!

00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:42.004
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Uh?

00:16:42.037 --> 00:16:43.305
Little Person, incoming!

00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:46.879
"Mouji!" She cries for me!

00:16:46.913 --> 00:16:49.451
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES yell]

00:16:49.485 --> 00:16:51.121
[MOUJI]
Princess!

00:16:51.155 --> 00:16:52.490
[DWARVES]
Mouji!

00:16:52.525 --> 00:16:55.462
[MOUJI]
Princess!

00:16:55.496 --> 00:16:58.135
Princess!

00:16:58.169 --> 00:17:00.741
Wait but a moment
and I will be there!

00:17:00.774 --> 00:17:04.314
[DWARF K] Oh no! That sign
there says "don't run"!

00:17:08.221 --> 00:17:11.328
[DWARF K] And it looks like
we have to keep left, too!

00:17:11.362 --> 00:17:11.997
Huh?

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.332
Mouji, wait!

00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:14.969
[DWARF K]
That's the isolation ward!

00:17:15.002 --> 00:17:18.376
Mansherry must be in there!

00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:20.847
Don't worry, I'll save you!

00:17:20.881 --> 00:17:22.719
Hold on! You can't do it!

00:17:22.752 --> 00:17:24.020
Why would you say that?!

00:17:24.053 --> 00:17:26.525
Look at that sign
up on the door!

00:17:27.962 --> 00:17:29.331
[DWARF L]
It says "keep out"!

00:17:29.364 --> 00:17:31.268
That means we can't go in there!

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:33.974
Oh no! What a tragedy!

00:17:34.007 --> 00:17:36.278
Why didn't anyone
tell me until now?

00:17:36.312 --> 00:17:39.919
It's far too late
for me to slow down!

00:17:39.952 --> 00:17:40.988
[GROUP gasps]

00:17:41.021 --> 00:17:42.224
He crashed right
through that door

00:17:42.257 --> 00:17:44.696
like the "keep out" sign
wasn't even there!

00:17:44.729 --> 00:17:46.365
I'm so disappointed in you!

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:49.805
Your blatant disregard for
the rules makes us look bad!

00:17:49.838 --> 00:17:52.043
I'm sorry... Oh?

00:17:52.076 --> 00:17:53.713
[DWARVES gasp]

00:18:00.126 --> 00:18:03.967
I don't see anyone in here.
Is it just for storage?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.739
[DWARF S]
No, that can't be right.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.315
But, the princess!

00:18:11.348 --> 00:18:14.053
If she isn't here,
then where is she?

00:18:14.087 --> 00:18:17.761
[DWARF T groans]
Is everybody ready?

00:18:17.794 --> 00:18:19.965
[DWARVES]
Let's go!

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:20.967
[DWARVES groan]

00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:22.437
[CHAO]
Faster!

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.610
[FRANKY yells]

00:18:26.546 --> 00:18:30.721
[WOMEN gasp]
You're so relentless, Señor!

00:18:30.754 --> 00:18:32.023
[DWARVES grunt]

00:18:32.056 --> 00:18:33.860
C'mon, hurry!

00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:37.467
[SEÑOR]
Nighty-night.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.170
[FRANKY groans]

00:18:42.944 --> 00:18:46.318
Get real.
Is that all you've got?

00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:50.126
Look at that.
You're a real tough guy.

00:18:50.159 --> 00:18:52.898
[DWARVES grunt]

00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:55.737
[CHAO]
Almost there!

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.173
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:18:58.009 --> 00:18:59.144
[NARRATOR]
Franky Ear!

00:18:59.177 --> 00:19:00.547
Unlike the rest of his body,

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.218
his ears have no
mechanical advantage.

00:19:03.252 --> 00:19:06.158
However, his hearing is
naturally quite good,

00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:08.530
so he gets along just fine.

00:19:08.563 --> 00:19:11.769
Listen, somethin's
been buggin' me.

00:19:11.802 --> 00:19:12.905
[SEÑOR]
Hmm?

00:19:12.938 --> 00:19:15.878
It's not the kinda thing
you'd care about, I guess.

00:19:15.911 --> 00:19:18.448
[grunts]

00:19:18.482 --> 00:19:20.252
But, uh...

00:19:21.689 --> 00:19:23.826
[FRANKY] ...earlier,
I saw this sweet old granny

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.566
having a tough time on
that street over there

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:29.772
and it darn near broke my heart.

00:19:29.805 --> 00:19:31.509
[SEÑOR grunts]

00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:46.839
Is that so? You sure
hate to see that.

00:19:46.872 --> 00:19:48.743
[SEÑOR grunts]

00:19:53.987 --> 00:19:55.958
[WOMEN]
Hey, Señor?

00:19:55.991 --> 00:19:57.427
[SEÑOR]
I just remembered,

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.365
I've got some business
to take care of.

00:20:05.877 --> 00:20:08.549
[WOMEN]
Oh! Wait for us!

00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:18.770
[FRANKY chuckles]

00:20:18.803 --> 00:20:20.641

00:20:20.674 --> 00:20:23.445

Turn harder! You're so close!

00:20:23.478 --> 00:20:25.416

Everyone, help 'em out!

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.453
[DWARVES]
Got it!

00:20:28.255 --> 00:20:32.363
Not so fast! Little shrimps!

[DWARF U gasps]

00:20:41.649 --> 00:20:43.586
You think I'm gonna let you out?

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.726
Better remember who's
in charge of this place!

00:20:46.759 --> 00:20:47.894
[DWARVES gasp]

00:20:47.928 --> 00:20:51.334
It's the manager!
We're in big trouble now!

00:20:51.367 --> 00:20:54.575
Pathetic! You twerps have
been here all this time

00:20:54.608 --> 00:20:57.347
and you just now realized
you're nothing but slaves?

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.185
I'll put you back to work!
Break time is over!

00:21:00.219 --> 00:21:01.221
Don't be lay abouts!

00:21:01.254 --> 00:21:03.793
[DWARVES groan]

00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:14.214
[cackles] Come here!

00:21:14.247 --> 00:21:16.786
[DWARVES groaning]

00:21:16.819 --> 00:21:18.255
[CHAO]
Get away! Quick!

00:21:18.288 --> 00:21:21.762

00:21:21.795 --> 00:21:24.635

[KUWEEN cackles]

00:21:28.609 --> 00:21:31.281
[DWARF Z] If she sucks us up
with that thing, we're done for!

00:21:31.314 --> 00:21:32.517
[DWARVES scream]

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.387
You think you can
escape from me?

00:21:34.421 --> 00:21:39.798
[DWARVES screaming]

00:21:45.309 --> 00:21:48.081
Now, this is how
you clean up a mess!

00:21:49.751 --> 00:21:50.921
[DWARF AA yelps]

00:21:50.954 --> 00:21:52.958
If we don't come up with
something quick, we're finished!

00:21:52.992 --> 00:21:56.265
Open the door! That's
our only hope! Hurry!

00:21:56.298 --> 00:21:57.534
[CHAO]
I'm trying!

00:21:57.567 --> 00:22:01.976
I'm not letting you go!
Vacuuming, power up!

00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:04.882
[DWARVES scream]

00:22:04.915 --> 00:22:07.921
You stubborn little vermin!
Give up already!

00:22:07.955 --> 00:22:08.990
We'll never give up!

00:22:09.024 --> 00:22:12.263
We'll keep on fighting
till this door is open!

00:22:12.296 --> 00:22:15.002

00:23:00.727 --> 00:23:02.597
[chuckles]

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:06.437
Nice work, you guys.
Let's party.

00:23:13.953 --> 00:23:15.990
[NARRATOR] Finally released
from the SMILE Factory,

00:23:16.024 --> 00:23:18.630
the Tontattas can scarcely
contain their joy.

00:23:18.663 --> 00:23:20.499
However, when
they're unable to find

00:23:20.534 --> 00:23:22.303
their missing
princess, Mansherry,

00:23:22.336 --> 00:23:24.407
that joy soon turns to worry.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.811
Meanwhile, the
hard-boiled battle

00:23:25.844 --> 00:23:28.381
between Franky
and Señor begins anew

00:23:28.415 --> 00:23:31.220
as Kuween leaps into the
fray to get her revenge.

00:23:31.254 --> 00:23:32.724
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.758 --> 00:23:36.264
"The Little People's Princess!
Captive Mansherry!"

00:23:36.297 --> 00:23:38.970
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
