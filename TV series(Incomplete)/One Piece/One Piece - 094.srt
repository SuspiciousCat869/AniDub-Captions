00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,026
King of the Pirates.

176
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,162
And not you, Luffy. Sorry.

177
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,530
Heh, that's fine.

178
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,866
I guess we'll just
have to fight then.

179
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,037
Because I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

180
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,072
[LUFFY gulping water]

181
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,208
[ACE] Stop it! Don't drink
it all, you mooch! Hey!

182
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,951
[MR. 11] Something big
must be going on in town.

183
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,220
All the Marines onboard wouldn't
have left me and the ship

184
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,256
unattended like this
if there wasn't!

185
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,091
[MR. 11 sighs, laughs]

186
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,058
Oh well, whatever it is,

187
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:50,029
it's given me a perfect
opportunity to escape!

188
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,397
[BILLIONS A]
Mr. 11.

189
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,265
[MR. 11 groans]

190
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,066
Well now, since you
know my codename,

191
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,568
that can only mean that
the three of you are

192
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,136
members of Baroque Works!

193
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,804
I'd guess Millions.

194
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,273
Hurry up and untie me!

195
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,042
You're right about one thing.
We're with Baroque Works.

196
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,578
But we're in line to become
number agents, you see.

197
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,580
We're not millions,
we're billions.

198
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,048
You are a numbered agent,

199
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,917
but looks like you're
barely one at that.

200
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,552
A stronger agent would
have never been captured

201
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,953
by the Marines like this.

202
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,055
[MR. 11]
Can we discuss this later?

203
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,590
Like when I'm not tied up maybe?

204
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,791
Now help another member out

205
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,426
before all those
Marines come back!

206
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,796
Heh, heh. Oh, we'll
help you all right!

207
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:24,830
[gasps]

208
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,300
[BILLIONS A] Right off
this mortal coil that is!

209
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,435
A Billions can get promoted
to a Number Agent

210
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,103
whenever there's a seat to fill!

211
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,838
[GERONIMO grunts]

212
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,975
And your position...
is about to be empty.

213
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,977
Wait! No, hold on!

214
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,448
‐‐[bang]

Hey!

00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,422
[BILLIONS D pants]

217
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,958
You won't believe it!
Fire Fist Ace is here!

218
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,260
[BILLIONS A]
What?! Fire Fist Ace?!

219
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,928
You mean the Second
Division Commander

220
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,096
of the Whitebeard Pirates?!

221
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,099
Heh, if we can take someone
with his reputation down,

222
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,369
then we're guaranteed
to become Number Agents!

223
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,137
[ACE]
All right, enough chitchat.

224
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,607
We need to find your friends
before the Marines do.

225
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,275
Do you have any idea where
they could have gone?

226
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,142
[LUFFY]
I don't know.

227
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,979
They might've gone
back to the ship.

228
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,481
Well, that's a start.
Where's it docked at?

229
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,451
Actually, I'm not
sure. That's funny.

230
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,553
Huh, jeez.

231
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,956
[ACE] You know, Luffy,
pirate ship captains

232
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,992
usually remember where
they leave their ships.

233
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,526
Yeah, but I was hungry,

234
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,861
and I forgot.

235
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,230
You haven't changed at all.

236
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,499
So, tell me about your crew.

237
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,568
What are they like?
Who are they?

238
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,404
Well first there's a tough guy
who carries around three swords,

239
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,073
wants to be the greatest
swordsman in the world.

240
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,008
Then there's a navigator

241
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,510
who likes maps and
tangerines and money.

242
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,979
There's also a cook who
makes really yummy food.

243
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,180
There's a liar, too.

244
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:53,486
Oh! And we just got a doctor
who happens to be a reindeer!

245
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,187
Really, you don't say.

246
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,923
Sounds like you've got
a motley crew there.

247
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,593
[LUFFY] We also have a
princess and her giant duck.

248
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,560
[ACE]
Oh?

249
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,896
[LUFFY] Everyone in my
crew is so interesting!

250
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,031
[ACE]
Sure sounds like it,

251
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,167
but I'd wager you're the
most interesting one of all.

252
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,337
But still, only a handful
of people for a pirate crew.

253
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,938
That's just like you.

254
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,075
I'm still lookin' for
a musician though.

255
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,511
[BILLIONS A]
Stop right there, Fire Fist!

256
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,213
[footsteps approaching]

257
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,617
[GERONIMO]
You've got no place to run, Ace.

258
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,085
Your head is mine!

259
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,521
It's my ticket to a promotion.

260
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,357
Prepare to die!

261
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,446
Um... is it okay...

262
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,549
...for a ship to set sail
without it's captain onboard?

263
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,318
The first place the Marines are
gonna look for us is the harbor.

264
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,554
So our top priority
is to hide the ship.

265
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,422
I know of a secluded cove
that's up ahead.

266
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,590
We can anchor the ship there.

267
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,426
All right, so we lay low,
let things cool down a bit,

268
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,661
and then go back for Luffy.

269
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,496
Good grief! That guy
attracts trouble

270
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,665
just like a dead guy
attracts vultures.

271
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:17,603
Yeah. That's the only reliable
thing our captain ever does.

272
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,646
It's our lucky day, boys.

273
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,750
This'll be easier than
shootin' fish in a barrel.

274
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:31,650
[BILLIONS D]
Heh.

275
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,320
[BILLIONS C]
Hey, look at that other guy.

276
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:37,356
Is it just me, or does he kinda
look like Straw Hat Luffy?

277
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,493
Hey... now that you
mention it, it is him!

278
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,461
He's worth 30 million Berries!

279
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,662
[LUFFY]
Hm?

280
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,032
Well well, it looks like our
lucky day just got even luckier.

281
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,301
That big promotion's
only a hop, skip, jump,

282
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,504
and two severed
pirate heads away!

283
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,305
[ACE]
Anyway, let's go find your ship.

284
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,340
We'll start at the shore.

285
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,641

'Kay.

00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,110

Hold it right there!

You can't walk away from us!

289
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,784

Yeah, he's right!

is riding on those two!

Do you have any idea how much
trouble you've put us in?

337

Can't you at least try and
act like a captain sometime?

I'm sorry... Oh!
That's right! Where's Ace?

Wait a minute.

00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,326
You didn't just
leave him, did you?

Ace is really strong.

345
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,299
So how strong is he?

346
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,633
Well, let me put it like this.

347
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,502
When we were younger,
I was never able to

348
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,704
beat him in a fight, and this
was way back in the days

349
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,839
before he ate a
Flame Flame Fruit!

350
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,808
That's how strong
my big brother is!

351
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,543
You mean there's a
flesh‐and‐blood person

352
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,711
that you couldn't beat?!

353
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,647
The big brother of a monster
is an even bigger monster.

354
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:52,518
I guess so, 'cause Ace used to
beat me up all the time. Ha, ha!

355
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,386
But I bet now I could
kick his big butt!

356
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,554
[LUFFY laughs]

357
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,390
[ZORO] I'd like to see you
try and back that claim up.

358
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,995
[ACE]
So... exactly whose butt's...

359
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,830
...getting kicked?

360
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,366
Oh, hey, Ace!

361
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,501
This is my crew I was
telling you about!

362
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,403
[ACE] Nice to meet you
and thanks for taking care of

363
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,672
my kid brother!
I know he's a handful!

364
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,407
[ALL]
Oh, no, not at all.

365
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,344
Come on, be honest. This is
Luffy we're talking about!

366
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:21,313
Isn't he a bit much for you
to handle at times?

367
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,481
[ALL]
Not at all.

368
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,383
[ACE]
You're good people.

369
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,518
Well, sit down and relax.

370
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,921
I'm sure you two have
lots of catching up to do.

371
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,022
I'll make some tea.

372
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,359
No, that's thoughtful,
but I don't want to impose.

373
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,897
[SANJI] He's not exactly
what I expected.

374
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,499
[ZORO]
I'll say.

375
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,002
He's polite, helpful,
and gracious,

376
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,703
the polar opposite of Luffy.

377
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,872
One of 'em only cares
about stuffing his face.

378
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,874
There's no way
these two can be brothers!

379
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,943
While the other only
cares about his brother!

380
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,412
I wish I had a wonderful
brother like that!

381
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,382
Brother? I wish I had a
wonderful captain like that.

382
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,384
Sanji! He's kidding!

383
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,720
See! I told you they
were interesting. Ha, ha, ha!

384
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,025
[VIVI]
Baroque Works!

385
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,760
Those are the Billions' ships!

386
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,596
Are we going to let them
escape from the Billions?

387
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,598
[BILLIONS]
No way!

388
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,034
We'll show 'em what Baroque
Works' Billions are made of!

389
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,435
Full speed ahead!

390
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,903
Those guys again?

391
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,538
‐‐[ACE] Luffy.
‐‐[LUFFY] Hm?

392
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,873
Leave it to me,
I'll handle them.

393
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:21,974
[NAMI,VIVI]
Eh?

394
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,077
He's going all by himself?

395
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,446
And in that dinky boat, too.

396
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,983
I wouldn't worry
about him if I were you.

397
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,217
They don't let
just anyone become

398
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,421
the Second Division Commander
of the Whitebeard Pirates.

399
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,722
[BILLIONS E]
Is he insane?!

400
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,824
Fire Fist is heading
right towards us!

401
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,825
[BILLIONS H]
Let him come!

402
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,761
Our ships are gonna make
matchsticks out of his!

403
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:46,965
He jumped!

404
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,434
[BILLIONS A]
Open fire!

405
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,936
[BILLIONS B]
Blow him to pieces, men!

406
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,612
‐‐[BILLIONS gasp]
‐‐[STRAW HATS gasp]

407
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,614
[ACE]
Heh. Fire Fist!

408
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,316
[BILLIONS yell]

409
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,868
[ACE]
Heh.

410
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,136
[ALL gasp]

411
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,873
‐‐[LUFFY laughs]
‐‐[USOPP] He roasted them!

412
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:44,189
[TASHIGI] Captain Smoker! We've
combed the entire city, sir,

413
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:47,159
but Straw Hat Luffy and his
crew are nowhere to be found.

414
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,828
Do you wanna know
who I saw with them?

415
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,498
Vivi, and I'm certain
it was her, too.

416
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,867
Vivi? As in
Princess Vivi Nefertari?

417
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,503
But what would she be doing
with the Straw Hat pirates?

418
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,670
She must be their hostage.

419
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,206
They probably abducted her
in the hopes that her father

420
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,342
would pay a hefty ransom.

421
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,243
Doubt it.

422
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,978
She wasn't acting
like a kidnap victim,

423
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,513
more like part of the crew.

424
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:11,517
The Princess...
acting like a pirate?

425
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,418
Something strange is happening.

426
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,687
I just wish I knew what it was.

427
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,590
[SERGEANT]
Captain Smoker! I'm sorry, sir!

428
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,226
But it appears that Mr. 11
was killed onboard the ship

429
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,362
while we were off
searching for the Straw Hats!

430
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,731
Who, by the way, we still
haven't located yet!

431
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,733
Call off the search
for Straw Hat Luffy,

432
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,369
I have a pretty good idea
where he's headed.

433
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:33,005
He's after Crocodile.
I'm sure of it.

434
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,276
Why Crocodile? He's one of
the Seven Warlords of the Sea!

435
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,378
A pirate given
government approval!

436
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,880
[SMOKER] I find all of the
Seven Warlords despicable,

437
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,383
but Crocodile's
the absolute worst.

438
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,617
[TASHIGI]
Politically‐speaking,

439
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,887
isn't he an ally of the World
Government and the Marines?

440
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,256
Crocodile might have
the powers‐that‐be fooled,

441
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,424
but not me.

442
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,560
They're delusional if they
think giving him a sanction

443
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,728
will make him obey.
He's a pirate!

444
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,398
There's one thing you always
need to remember, Tashigi.

445
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,234
A pirate's a pirate,
no matter where they go.

446
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,536
They never change.

447
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,538
Crocodile will
lead us right to him.

448
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,740
Straw Hat'll show up
wherever he is,

449
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,609
and I'm sure we'll
find out what's going on

450
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:11,610
when we get there.

451
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,947
There'll be no escape
for him, not this time.

452
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,215
‐‐[LUFFY] Woo‐hoo!
‐‐[USOPP] All right!

453
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,751
[USOPP] Since he's one of us
now, here's to Fire Fist Ace!

454
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:20,652
[CHOPPER, USOPP, LUFFY]
Cheers!

455
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,755
Wait! Who said I was
joining your crew?

456
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,059
And to delicious drinks, eh?

457
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:27,793
[CHOPPER, USOPP, LUFFY]
Cheers!

458
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:28,994
Oh, don't worry.

459
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,896
You can't take anything
they say seriously

460
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:31,663
when they're like this.

461
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,898
They get all goofy
when they drink.

462
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,901
[LUFFY, USOPP] Medicine isn't
delicious, it's terrible!

463
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,470
[CHOPPER, USOPP, LUFFY laugh]

464
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,572
Ace! Are you sure
you don't wanna join us?

465
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,074
It'll be fun! I promise.

466
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,010
I can't right now.
I'm chasing someone.

467
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,413
He's a pirate named Blackbeard.

468
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,648
Uh... Blackbeard?!

469
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,851
We've heard of him. He was the
one who attacked Drum Kingdom!

470
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,786
You see, Blackbeard
used to be a member of

471
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,955
the Second Division of
the Whitebeard Pirates.

472
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,790
He was one of my own men,
but he committed

473
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,959
the most unforgiveable sin
a pirate could.

474
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,761
He killed one of his
fellow crewmembers

475
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,429
and then he jumped ship.

476
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,766
As Commander of his division,
it's my responsibility

477
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,034
to take care of him.

478
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,637
[USOPP]
So that's why you're after him.

479
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,705
I came here because
I'd heard that Blackbeard

480
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,874
was seen in Alabasta,
in a place called Yuba,

481
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,943
so that's where I'm headed.

482
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:20,712
[NAMI]
Hey...

483
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,348
That's our
destination too, right?

484
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,018
[VIVI] Exactly. We've just
entered the Sandora River.

485
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,819
We'll take it to Erumalu,
where we'll dock,

486
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,790
and then we'll proceed on foot
until we reach Yuba, here.

487
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,692
The leader of the
rebel army is there.

488
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:34,660
That's where we're going.

489
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,796
You don't say. Do you
mind if I tag along?

490
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,731
Nami, Vivi, I'll
follow you anywhere!

491
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,866
Just tell me where to go!

492
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,701
Hopefully it's off of a cliff.

493
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:43,835
[SANJI]
What'd you say, Zoro?!

494
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,537
[NAMI]
Cool it, you two!

495
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,639
Well, looks you'll be with us
for a little while, Ace!

496
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,842
[USOPP] Ha, ha! We're all really
happy to have you aboard.

00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:50,802
<i>At breakneck speed, I know</i>
<i>we'll arrive there soon!</i>

512
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,772
<i>If we do not give up,</i>

513
00:22:53,805 --> 00:23:01,446
<i>Someday we'll wash up on that</i>
<i>white beach we dreamed up,</i>

514
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,616
<i>It's really not</i>
<i>all that far away...♪</i>

515
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,464
[NAMI]
This is Erumalu?

516
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,133
[LUFFY]
Huh? There's nothing here!

517
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,068
[VIVI]
Erumalu, the City of Green.

518
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,970
[LUFFY] City of Green?
There's no green anywhere!

519
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,139
[VIVI] It was a thriving
city until recently.

520
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,407
[USOPP]
This place?

521
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,742
[VIVI] Karoo, I have a very
important favor to ask of you.

522
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,511
I want you to
go to Alubarna.

523
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,612
[KAROO squawks]

524
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,447
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

525
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,117
"Erumalu, the City of Green
and the Kung Fu Dugongs!"

526
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,787
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
