1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,491
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,261
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,497
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,333
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,401
Monkey D. Luffy,

42
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,203
a boy whose
body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,771
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,674
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,610
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

46
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,312
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,747
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,017
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,587
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,757
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,160
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,698
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

53
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,237
[NARRATOR] Luffy left
the female-only nation

54
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,706
of Amazon Lily to
rescue his brother Ace

55
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,709
from execution by
the World Government.

56
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,312
With the help of
the Snake Princess, Hancock,

57
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,581
Luffy stowed away
on board a Navy ship

58
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:38,518
headed to the colossal prison
known as Impel Down.

59
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,689
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
the other Straw Hats,

60
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,525
scattered around the globe
by Bartholomew Kuma,

61
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,627
face struggles of their own.

62
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,172
[LUFFY]
The Friends' Whereabouts!

63
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,041
Bridging the Islands
and Vicious Vegetation!

64
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,679
[HANCOCK] Love-Love Beam!

65
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,517
I'm starting to worry that we
might not survive this trip.

66
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,453
You'd think they'd learn by now.

67
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:17,056
Luffy. The food
has arrived. Luffy?

68
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:21,794
Hey. Seems like we should've
reached Ace by now, huh?

69
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,664
[HANCOCK] No. I'm afraid
we still have a while to go.

70
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,366
Okay...

71
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,740
[gasps] Awesome! I'm starving!

72
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,711
[HANCOCK] Luffy.

73
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,513
Hm?

74
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,282
Would you care
for a cup of tea?

75
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,683
Sure, that sounds good.

76
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,618
Thank you. Darling.

77
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,854
[HANCOCK] My pleasure!

78
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,157
Oh. I'll just
brew some up then.

79
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,693
So, Luffy. Why don't
you tell me a little

80
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,329
about your friends--
I don't know a thing.

81
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,465
[HANCOCK] Of course, you don't
have to if you don't want to.

82
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,234
I'm just making conversation--

83
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,336
it's not like I'm trying
to dig into your personal life

84
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,605
and find out every
little thing about you.

85
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,207
Okay. Which one
should I start with?

86
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,843
Zoro. Sanji. Usopp.
There's Brook.

87
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,246
Franky. Nami or Robin.

88
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,580
[HANCOCK] Nami? Robin?

89
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,349
Those sound like girl's names!

90
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:19,585
[LUFFY] They are. You're
watering the table, y'know.

91
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,755
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
you and I can't be together.

92
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,858
But why? Tell me why, Luffy!

93
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,261
Because I'm already
with Nami and Robin.

94
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,296
[NAMI and ROBIN giggle]

95
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,834
I don't care!
I won't give up that easily!

96
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,303
You really suck at making tea.

97
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,856
[gasps]

98
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,864
A woman?

99
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,668
[GIRL]
Her clothes are so strange.

100
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,870
She can't be from here.

101
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,706
[ROBIN coughs]

102
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,608
She's alive.

103
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,448
Are you okay, miss?

104
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,685
Well, I'm not really sure.

105
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,321
Where am I? It's cold.

106
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:32,558
[GIRL] You're in Tequila Wolf.
It's a country in the East Blue.

107
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,827
[shivers]

108
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,964
You're shivering. Do you
want to come back to my house?

109
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,634
Well, if it doesn't put
you out--yes, I would love to.

110
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,807
[SLAVER 420A] Keep movin'!
Pick up the pace!

111
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,443
[chuckles]

112
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,759
[ALL] Hm?

113
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,730
Soran! Did you go out again
without asking us?

114
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,265
[SLAVE WOMAN A]
Don't risk it, child!

115
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,434
The officers
didn't see you, right?

116
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,802
[SORAN] Mm.

117
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,870
Who's that you've
brought with ya?

118
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:18,905
[SLAVE WOMAN EYELASHES]
I don't know her.

119
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,740
Doesn't look like
she's from here.

120
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,708
I found her in the snow.
She was freezing.

121
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,876
She's a drifter?

122
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,412
It's more likely
she's a fugitive.

123
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,047
Well, at least
we know she's crazy.

124
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,616
No sane person
would wanna come here.

125
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,718
I can tell when I'm
not welcome someplace.

126
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,320
It's fine, I'll leave.

127
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,390
I'll take responsibility
for her, okay?

128
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,525
You're not the only one
who lives here, child.

129
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,461
What do you think
will happen if the officers

130
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,563
find out we're giving
shelter to a stranger?

131
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,431
[SORAN] I'll take the blame!

132
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,702
[grunts] You can't
reason with that girl.

133
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,804
And where do you
plan on hiding her?

134
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,072
She'll stay in my room.

135
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,173
The loft upstairs?

136
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,043
Ah, she'd be okay up there
for a day or two, I suppose.

137
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,277
Don't tell me you're serious.

138
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,080
We should turn her in before
it's too late and we get caught.

139
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,016
It's already too late--
we've let her into our house.

140
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,586
Might as well show her
some courtesy at this point.

141
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:11,324
Uh! You do what you want,
but keep me out of it.

142
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,392
[SORAN] Thank you.

143
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,027
Don't go thinkin'
this is for good.

144
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,896
She's leaving once
her wounds are healed.

145
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,965
You know she's better off
getting out of this country

146
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,900
as quick as she can.

147
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,539
[ROBIN]
They seem like kind people.

148
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,907
Yeah.

149
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,613
[ROBIN] Thanks.

150
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,885
Something about you
smells so nice.

151
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,454
[ROBIN] I'm not wearing
any kind of perfume.

152
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:44,023
Maybe it's the scent
of the outside world.

153
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,058
What do you mean by that?

154
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:54,534
Well, you see, I haven't
left here since I was born.

155
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,703
Are you some kind of traveler?

156
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,540
Did you come here
from a warm climate?

157
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,543
[ROBIN] Yes. I've been
traveling the world on a ship.

158
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,077
Is it a big ship?

159
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,046
What's the island
you came from like?

160
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,116
And were there any beautiful
birds or flowers there?

161
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:10,950
And was there--

162
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,952
[ringing]

163
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,621
Soran! Time to work,
break's over!

164
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,123
Hurry up and get ready!

165
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,692
I have to go work now.

166
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,661
You work this late at night?

167
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,965
[SORAN] We work all day every
day and all night every night.

168
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,003
You should get some rest now.

169
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,673
But I'd love to hear about
your travels when I get back.

170
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,542
Sure. I'll be
right here... Soran.

171
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,868
Bye.

172
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:54,285
[ROBIN] I don't think I can
make it in time to help them.

173
00:09:57,321 --> 00:10:07,331
[distant clanging]

174
00:10:26,384 --> 00:10:28,019
[door opens]

175
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:29,153
[gasps]

176
00:10:29,186 --> 00:10:30,988
[SORAN]
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

177
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:34,191
[ROBIN]
Soran, you're covered in dirt.

178
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:35,259
It's okay.

179
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:37,962
Just what kind of work
do they make you do here?

180
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:40,031
We're trying
to build a bridge.

181
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:41,032
[ROBIN] What?

182
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:43,401
This country is nothing
but one giant bridge.

183
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:51,475
[distant clanging]

184
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:53,044
[SORAN] It's eventually
supposed to connect

185
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:55,146
a bunch of islands together.

186
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:58,149
The construction has been
going on for centuries now.

187
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:00,117
At least that's
what the officers say.

188
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:01,552
For whole centuries?

189
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:02,653
If you don't mind,

190
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:05,122
do you think you can tell me
about where you're from?

191
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:06,757
[ROBIN] You mean my home?

192
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:11,095
The island I'm from is now gone.

193
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,563
But my true home is on the sea

194
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:15,199
and I've traveled
to countless islands.

195
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:17,068
[gasps]

196
00:11:18,402 --> 00:11:20,237
[ROBIN] Soran?

197
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:21,806
Mm!

198
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:25,242
[ROBIN] What're these?

199
00:11:25,276 --> 00:11:27,244
They're islands
from around the world.

200
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:29,447
I drew them all
from my imagination

201
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,283
since I've never been
outside Tequila Wolf.

202
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,851
[SORAN] But whenever
I'm drawing one,

203
00:11:33,884 --> 00:11:35,453
it makes me feel like I'm there,

204
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,822
like I'm actually
visiting that island.

205
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,357
And I forget all about
being stuck here!

206
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:43,227
Wow. These are great!

207
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,463
[gasps] Sky Island!

208
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,099
Wait, you know it?
So you mean it's real?

209
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:49,333
[ROBIN] Yes.

210
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:51,335
[SORAN] And you went there?
Will you tell me all about it?

211
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:54,205
Of course. Now let's see...

212
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:57,341
I guess I should start
at the beginning of our trip.

213
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:13,157
Wow! Amazing!

214
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,092
I knew the outside world
was incredible,

215
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:17,495
but I'd never
met anyone who'd seen it!

216
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,064
In this place,
they push us around every day

217
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:21,899
and they work us
until we're so exhausted

218
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:23,033
that we just collapse.

219
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,569
But now that I think about it,
maybe it's not so bad--

220
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,304
I mean, at least
we're building something

221
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:29,039
that will help
to connect the world.

222
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:31,142
And once the big bridge
is finally complete,

223
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:32,943
everybody everywhere
will get to see

224
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:36,046
so many beautiful islands
whenever they want!

225
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,950
There's nothing I'd like more!
I'll travel all over the world!

226
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:43,921
[SORAN] And I'll draw pictures
of the real islands I visit!

227
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:45,289
[gasps]

228
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:50,127
That's a lovely thought.

229
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:52,296
Will you tell me about
the other places you've been?

230
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:53,430
Sure, of course.

231
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:56,066
[SLAVE WOMAN EYELASHES]
Do you mind if we listen, too?

232
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:58,435
[ROBIN] Not at all.

233
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:06,343
The woman's up in the loft.

234
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:08,946
Good job. Let's head in, men!

235
00:13:10,114 --> 00:13:12,082
Hey, wait!
Don't forget we made a deal

236
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:13,050
and I held up my end

237
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,386
so you have to get me
out of this country!

238
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,587
Nobody move!

239
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,688
[SLAVE WOMAN 420A]
What's going on here?

240
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:18,923
[SLAVER 420A] Move it!

241
00:13:18,956 --> 00:13:20,090
We've come for the stranger.

242
00:13:20,124 --> 00:13:22,293
Get in our way and you will die.

243
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,962
What's all the noise?

244
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:27,364
Somebody ratted us out
to the officers.

245
00:13:27,398 --> 00:13:29,066
They're looking for her.

246
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:34,171
What do we do?

247
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,088
[SLAVER 420A grunts]

248
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,723
You guys need somethin'?

249
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:54,959
We've got it on
good authority that you lot

250
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:57,261
are harboring a suspicious
woman in this house.

251
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,597
You know we can't take
any chances these days.

252
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,365
There are too many people
out there opposed to

253
00:14:01,398 --> 00:14:04,435
the construction of the bridge.
Now turn her over!

254
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,670
We don't know
what you're talking about!

255
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,076
[SLAVE WOMAN EYELASHES] Look,
you're just wasting your time.

256
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:13,978
There's no one here,
now leave us alone!

257
00:14:14,011 --> 00:14:15,112
We're exhausted.

258
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,181
--[SLAVER 420A] Shut up!
--[SLAVE WOMAN EYELASHES] Uh!

259
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:18,048
Are you okay?

260
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:19,750
If you refuse
to cooperate with us,

261
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:21,452
we'll have no choice
but to arrest you

262
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,188
and question you individually.

263
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:25,155
[whimpers]

264
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:26,156
[CAPTAIN] I take it
you're familiar with our

265
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,727
interrogation tactics.
Is that what you want?

266
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:35,532
[SLAVER 420B grunts]

267
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,712
[SLAVER 420A]
Captain, I found these.

268
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:51,582
[gasps]

269
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:53,684
[CAPTAIN] All right.
And what is this crap?

270
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:54,652
[SLAVER 420A] Islands?

271
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,254
Those are my drawings!
Now give them back!

272
00:14:57,288 --> 00:14:59,456
[CAPTAIN] Hm. Islands, huh?

273
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:06,363
[laughs]

274
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:09,366
That is some sick sense
of irony you've got there, kid.

275
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,801
Give them back!

276
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:12,336
[CAPTAIN] Hm.

277
00:15:12,836 --> 00:15:14,805
[CAPTAIN]
You want your drawings back?

278
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:17,441
Then you better tell us
where the woman's hiding.

279
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:19,209
What woman?

280
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:22,279
[gasps]

281
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:23,714
[CAPTAIN]
Now let's try that again.

282
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:25,416
Where is the woman hiding?

283
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:27,084
I don't know.

284
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:30,654
Do you want off Tequila Wolf?

285
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:33,123
Cooperate and
I'll get you out of here.

286
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:35,259
[CAPTAIN] Then you can see
the outside world in person.

287
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:36,694
I don't know!

288
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:41,398
I'm giving you one last
chance to fess up!

289
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:43,200
[CAPTAIN]
Tell me where she is!

290
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,568
[gasps]

291
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,084
Look! I don't know!

292
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:06,590
[CAPTAIN grunting]

293
00:16:06,623 --> 00:16:08,392
[SORAN whimpers]

294
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,094
[CAPTAIN yells]

295
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:13,330
All you're doing is digging

296
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:15,566
an even deeper hole
for yourselves.

297
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,301
I'll make sure you all
rot on this bridge

298
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:18,769
for the rest of your lives!

299
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:21,205
Now take them all in
for questioning!

300
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:22,639
[CAPTAIN]
Torture them until they tell us

301
00:16:22,673 --> 00:16:24,575
what we want to hear!

302
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,644
And I want the kid
to get the worst of it.

303
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:29,413
[SLAVER 420A] C'mon! Move!

304
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:32,116
[SORAN] Where is she?

305
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:35,519
[whistle blows]

306
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:38,422
[distant gunfire]

307
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,757
[BOTH] Aah!

308
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,691
Now Clutch.

310
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:43,327
Ahhh!

311
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,362
Aah! Uh... Huh?

312
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:51,201
Uh, what's going on?
Hey, you guys?

313
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:56,540
[SLAVER 420F]
Aah! Stay back, I'll shoot!

314
00:16:56,573 --> 00:16:57,908
Put your hands up!

315
00:16:57,941 --> 00:16:59,476
[SLAVER 420F yells]

00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:09,787
Please don't hurt me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

319
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:12,856
[SLAVER 420F] Huh?

00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:18,228
[grunts]

321
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:20,731
I got you now! She's down here!

322
00:17:20,764 --> 00:17:23,167
[SLAVER 420F]
I have her in my sights! Hurry!

323
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,437
I need backup!
She's dangerous!

325
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:30,507
Why are you still here?
Didn't you hear him?

326
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,276
Yeah, the guy just said
he's got the woman

327
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:33,243
you've been looking for!

328
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:35,579
Why don't you quit
harassing us and go get her!

329
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:37,748
I think you've worn out
your welcome here.

[growls]

331
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:39,683
Uh, Captain?

332
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:40,918
Would you quit
standing around

333
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:42,519
and get down there
and cover him!

334
00:17:42,553 --> 00:17:43,887
Yes sir!

335
00:17:44,788 --> 00:17:46,657
I'm letting you
off the hook for now.

336
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,592
But you are sorely
mistaken if you think

337
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,694
I'm going to forget about this!

338
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:51,695

Have fun with that!

00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:34,638
to build this bridge
are criminals

350
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:36,273
from all over the world.

351
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:38,275
Either that or they're
citizens of countries

352
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:41,445
that refused to ally
with the World Government.

353
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:44,381
[wheezes]

354
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:46,750
[SLAVES grunting]

355
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:49,153
[SLAVER 420H]
Get up! On your feet!

356
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:50,821
[SLAVER CAPTAIN]
In short, they're slaves.

357
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:53,190
How much longer
until the bridge is complete?

358
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:54,725
[SLAVER CAPTAIN]
I have no idea.

359
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:58,462
But it's been under constant
construction for 700 years now.

360
00:18:58,495 --> 00:19:01,231
700? But for what purpose?

361
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,567
[SLAVER CAPTAIN] You don't need
to concern yourself with that.

362
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,469
Now that you're here
we're putting you to work

363
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:07,271
so the only thing
you need to worry about

364
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:10,307
is making the bridge. Got it?

365
00:19:18,148 --> 00:19:19,416
[NARRATOR]
Like a flower blossoming

366
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,717
in the middle of the ocean,

367
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:23,620
we now arrive
at the Bowin Islands.

368
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:26,223
[USOPP] Let's get this
exploration party going!

369
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:27,891
I will of course be
the leader of the group.

370
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:30,360
The fearless Sniper King, Usopp!

371
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:32,529
And here's my loyal
and trusty crew!

372
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:34,298
Enh! Enhhh!

373
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:36,667
Who sadly
couldn't be here today.

374
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,870
[USOPP] I give up!
Where the hell am I?

375
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,839
Ugh! I don't even know
if my friends are alive.

376
00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:45,842
Without me, it's doubtful
they will be for long.

377
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:49,213
In fact, I bet they're crying
my name right this instant.

378
00:19:49,246 --> 00:19:50,847
Mhm! They're lost without me!

379
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:52,916
I better hurry up
so I can go save them!

380
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,917
[rustling]

381
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:56,853
[screams]

382
00:19:58,722 --> 00:20:00,891
Just the wind.

383
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:01,959
[clears throat]

384
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,294
The one-man crew of
the Usopp exploration party

385
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,397
must remain ever
vigilant and watchful. Indeed.

386
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:09,666
Let's go, Usopp. Let's go!

387
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,868
Mmmm....

388
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:14,204
[panting]

389
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:16,273
Uh, I can't take this.

390
00:20:16,306 --> 00:20:19,509
I'm lonely.
Hey! Is anyone out there?

391
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:22,679
out there... out there...
out there... out there...

392
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:25,582
Oh please, don't let this
be a deserted island!

393
00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:27,284
Oooh! Oh, no, it's the

394
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:30,621
My-Heart-Will-Stop-Beating-
if-I'm-Left-Alone-Syndrome!

395
00:20:30,654 --> 00:20:32,189
Collapse.

396
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:37,494
[birds chirping]

397
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,363
[whimpers]

398
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:41,832
[USOPP] Hey! There's
gotta be someone out there!

399
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:45,302
Don't be shy,
come out and say hello!

400
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:46,703
Ah! I knew it!

401
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:49,973
How are ya?

402
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:51,408
[growls]

403
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:52,609
[screams]

404
00:20:52,643 --> 00:20:54,511
You're rather energetic today!

405
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,713
[shouting, yelps]

406
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:58,282
[yells]

407
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:02,352
[USOPP] Eeeh!

408
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,692
[USOPP yells]

409
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:12,429
[BUG groans]

410
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:17,634
[MAN] Aaa--ooh, oooh!

411
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:27,678
[birds chirping]

412
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:33,250
[USOPP gasps]

413
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,793
Huh?

414
00:21:42,826 --> 00:21:44,561
[USOPP] Hm?

415
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,729
[MAN] Gonna eat that?

416
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:46,863
Are you kidding?

417
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:49,032
But you saved my life so
you can eat whatever you want!

418
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:50,500
Thank you, whoever you are!

419
00:21:50,534 --> 00:21:52,736
[MAN] My name is Heracles'n.

420
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,372
[USOPP] Wow. That's a
pretty cool name ya got there.

421
00:21:55,405 --> 00:21:56,873
[HERACLES] Really? Think so?

422
00:21:56,907 --> 00:21:59,543
[USOPP chuckles]
I'm Usopp! Nice to meet ya.

423
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:05,015
[USOPP]
Ooh! Is this thing edible?

424
00:22:05,048 --> 00:22:07,617
I've never seen
this kind of fruit before.

425
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:10,020
[HERACLES]
Sure, Usopp'n. It's fine.

426
00:22:10,053 --> 00:22:12,489
By the way, you can call me...

427
00:22:12,522 --> 00:22:14,791
Heracles'n!

428
00:22:14,825 --> 00:22:17,728
Yeah, okay.
Heard ya the first time.

429
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:21,898
Well it definitely
smells delicious, at least.

430
00:22:21,932 --> 00:22:24,601
Hmmm. Maybe I'll just
give it a little lick.

431
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:26,670
[USOPP hollers]

432
00:22:27,437 --> 00:22:28,939
[USOPP shrieks]
[PLANT roars]

433
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,575
[HERACLES] Usopp'n!

434
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:33,710
What the--?
Was that thing a plant?

435
00:22:33,744 --> 00:22:35,846
And did it really
just try to eat me?

436
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:38,415
[HERACLES] Sure.
They are man-eating plants'n.

437
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:39,783
Man-eating?!

438
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:48,425
[USOPP yells]

439
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,827
Whoa!

00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,733
What the hell is this place?

444
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:59,603
[HERACLES] This is the
Swindling Forest, Glinston!

445
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:02,939
[USOPP] Help. Help! Help!

446
00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:05,909
[HERACLES] By the way,
you can call me... Hera--

00:23:14,151 --> 00:23:15,886
[NARRATOR]
Zoro arrives at an old castle

448
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,521
inhabited by Perona.

449
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:19,623
Although he is eager
to return to his crew,

450
00:23:19,656 --> 00:23:22,893
Perona seems strangely intent
on keeping him there.

451
00:23:22,926 --> 00:23:25,462
Meanwhile, Brook is
mistaken for Satan

452
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:26,997
when a group of cultists
believe they've

453
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,732
summoned the dark lord.

454
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:30,133
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece,

455

The Friends' Whereabouts!

A Negative Princess
and the King of Demons!

457
00:23:34,004 --> 00:23:36,072
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
