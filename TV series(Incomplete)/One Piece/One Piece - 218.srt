[CROWD cheering]

2
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,387
[ITOMIMIZU]
And in the right corner,

3
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,357
our challenger
hailing from East Blue

4
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,192
with a tiny crew of only seven

5
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,094
and a massive 100
million berry bounty...

6
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:13,534
The rubber wonder they call
"Straw Hat," Monkey D. Luffy!

7
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,703
Yeah!!

8
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,105
[cheering]

9
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,573
[ITOMIMIZU]
Wow! Luffy is sporting

10
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,443
a larger-than life afro
with a personality to match!

11
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,080
Yeah! Lookin' sharp, buddy!

12
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,481
That's messed up.

13
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,816
[bell ding]

14
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,518
[ITOMIMIZU]
And there goes the bell!

15
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,286
Feh!

16
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,254
Yeah!

17
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:36,190
Gum-Gum Pistol!

18
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:36,624
Ah!

19
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,091
Huh?

20
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:45,633
[LUFFY] My arm is fast,
but my fist is all slow!

21
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,035
Nine Tails Rush!

22
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:58,612
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

23
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:03,183
Be careful, kid. I wouldn't
touch that one if I were you.

24
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,452
And that one too.

25
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,791
[FOXY] Feh-feh-feh!
Can't say I didn't warn you!

26
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:20,634
Feh! Feh! Feh! Feh!

27
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,578
Oh no, that looks bad.

28
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,395
[ITOMIMIZU] A series of powerful
explosions rocks our ship...

29
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,629
[coughs]

30
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,533
[ITOMIMIZU] ...which just so
happens to be the battlefield.

31
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,535
The likely cause is
some Foxy merchandise

32
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,670
that just happens
to be explosive!

33
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,373
All this cheating just so
happens to be pissing me off!

34
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,475
No wonder that jerk's
never lost a match!

35
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,544
Luffy, speak to me!

36
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,678
Hey! Sit down!

37
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,647
[ITOMIMIZU] Using his
surroundings to his advantage,

38
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,716
our boss slammed
Straw Hat head-on

39
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,051
with a strategically
placed cannon attack!

40
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,154
No, he can't lose!

41
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,224
[ITOMIMIZU]
All I can see is smoke!

42
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,793
Was Straw Hat
blown to smithereens?

43
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,762
[LUFFY]
Whew! That was a close one!

44
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:25,065
[ITOMIMIZU] Indeed!
Foxy's onslaught was-- Ahh!

45
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,068
[ITOMIMIZU]
Whaaaaaat?!

46
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,136
Shut up! You're annoying!

47
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,507
[ITOMIMIZU] It's a miracle!
Straw Hat Luffy is alive!

48
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,378
Whoa! He's alive!

49
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:38,479
There's no way!

50
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,315
[ITOMIMIZU] He somehow
evaded the explosive attack

51
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,518
at point-blank range!
What amazing speed!

52
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:48,322
The 100 Million Berry Rubber
Boy is truly a thing of wonder!

53
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,523
That's the power of the 'fro!

54
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,458
Hurry it up, Luffy!

55
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,406
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

56
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,809
[ITOMIMIZU]
Uh-oh!

57
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,478
It looks like our boss' next
attack is already underway!

58
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,614
What could he be
plotting this time?

59
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,483
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

60
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:20,054
[ITOMIMIZU] The sneaky Foxy
lets out an unsettling laugh

61
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,056
from behind a thick
screen of smoke!

62
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,192
Meanwhile, Straw Hat stares
cluelessly into the abyss!

63
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,727
The suspense is killing me!

64
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,029
Where is our boss hiding?

65
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,097
[ITOMIMIZU]
Is that him?

66
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,375
How'd ya' like
that--you had enough?

67
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,144
You got blown up
twice as bad as me!

68
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,314
Shut up, I'm fine! See? Look!

69
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,716
You don't look fine at all!

70
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,484
[FOXY] I don't even want
you on my crew anymore!

71
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,186
I'd rather just crush you!

72
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,255
Slow-Slow Bea-- Huh?

73
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,191
Gum-Gum Hook!

74
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,158
I'm gonna break your arms

75
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,327
so you can't hit me
with those dumb beams!

76
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,063
Does this guy
wanna fight or not?

77
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,665
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

78
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,133
Huh?

79
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,601
There you are! Gotcha!

80
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,638
Huh? It was just a cut out?!

81
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,106
[FOXY]
Slow-Slow Beam!

82
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,677
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

83
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,250
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

84
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,785
Now what, huh?

85
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,520
Which one is the real me?

86
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,223
Which direction will
the beam come from?

87
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,824
How should I know?
They all look the same!

88
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:34,261
Just a bunch of Split-Heads
with stupid-looking haircuts!

89
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,365
[FOXY] Now a stupid
looking Split-Head?!

90
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,335
That one!

91
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,677
You jerk!

92
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,612
I may be a cheater, but
at least I have a heart!

93
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:52,746
You're in for it now!

94
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,147
Look up!

95
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,184
Hah!

96
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,620
Oowaah!

97
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,188
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

98
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,090
[LUFFY]
Damn it! A trap door!

99
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,459
[FOXY] That's what you get for
keeping your head in the clouds!

100
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,195
You're the one who told me to
look up, in the first place!

101
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,496
Feh-feh-feh!

102
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,765
So I did. Better
look down, too.

103
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,433
Huh? Hey! What?

104
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:18,505
Why is the floor moving?!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

105
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:21,975
Look! It's Luffy!

106
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,611
If he falls in the
water, he's done for!

107
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,346
Come on! You can't let
the fight end this way!

108
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,516
[LUFFY] Think you can
get rid of me that easy?!

109
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,355
Close call!

110
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,723
Hahaha!

111
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:36,690
It wouldn't be any fun

112
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:39,159
if boss knocked him
out right off the bat!

113
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:43,197
[FOXY CREW D] Hang in there,
Straw Hat! Afro power!

114
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,333
This ship's a pain in
the butt! What gives?!

115
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,535
Hey Split Head!
Where'd you go?!

116
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,272
Feh! Feh! Feh!

117
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,139
[ITOMIMIZU]
What have we here?

118
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:54,108
Straw Hat's narrow
escape didn't seem

119
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,643
to impress this Foxy Pin.

120
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,379
You might even say
it's laughing at him.

121
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,513
So there you are!

122
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:01,815
[ITOMIMIZU] The cabin of
the ship is Foxy's playground!

123
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,684
Will Luffy be lured inside?

124
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,386
Hold on, Luffy. It's a trap!

125
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,188
Whatever you do,
do not go in that ship!

126
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,758
[sighs]

127
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,494
[LUFFY] I'm gonna beat
that jerk's brains out!

128
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,062
[ITOMIMIZU] Straw Hat
throws caution to the wind

129
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,630
and dashes inside the ship!

130
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,731
Unfortunately,

131
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,700
that means I can't give
you a play-by-play anymore,

132
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,268
but I think it's safe to assume
that whatever is going on

133
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:24,772
in there is completely amazing!

134
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:25,906
Believe!

135
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,309
It's time to put those
wings to the test little bird!

136
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,743
So spread 'em and fly!

137
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,546
These seats are bad enough
without you standing in the way!

138
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:36,216
Cool, a gun deck!
It's huge, too!

139
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,385
Too bad Usopp isn't
here--he'd love this!

140
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,754
Now, where'd
Foxy run off to?

141
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:42,623
[door squeaking shut]

142
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,291
Ah-ha! He's over there!

143
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,327
[FOXY panting]

144
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,630
Feh-feh-feh-feh!

145
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,499
All right, good,
he's coming after me.

146
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,570
And now he'll come rushing
through that door like an idiot.

147
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,406
But we'll see how chipper
our little rubber boy is...

148
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,575
...when my room full of
two foot steel spikes

149
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,344
makes Swiss
cheese out of him!

150
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,446
Feh-feh-feh!

151
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:08,081
Come on Straw Hat,
you know you want-- Aaah!

152
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,258
Ahhhh!!

153
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,495
[LUFFY]
Hey, it's him.

154
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,831
Wow, wonder what
that room's used for.

155
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,599
What kind of monster
fires off cannons

156
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,568
inside someone else's ship?!

157
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,169
Hmm?

158
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:37,811
At least he stopped
running away.

159
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,713
You brat!

160
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:43,484
Diiiiiiie!

161
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,486
I'll show you! Just wait!

162
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,488
Ah, no way.

163
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,557
[LUFFY]
Come back and fight me!!

164
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:56,163
Doesn't he have any
common decency? Honestly!

165
00:09:56,196 --> 00:10:00,467
I've had enough!
Foxy Face Transformation!

166
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,637
I got you now!

167
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,040
Hm? Who's that?

168
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,374
Dear me! Are you ill?

169
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,476
Tell me where it
hurts and I'll fix it.

170
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,813
Is it your head? Is that it?
Are you sick in the head?

171
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:13,780
Wait a sec...

172
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,516
Did you see someone
else come through here?

173
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:18,719
Why no! I didn't see a soul.
But never mind that.

174
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:22,289
You broke something
didn't you? Your face?

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,226
I could of sworn
I saw him go in there.

Hold on! That weird lady
she looked just like him!

00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:35,803
I get it!

Hey! You must be Foxy's

Oh! So that's it!

00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:56,390
She lied to me so
I wouldn't find her brother!

184
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,725
Is he even trying
to fight anymore?!

Oh! The kitchen!

Ah-hem... Yes?

Have you seen some old fox dude
with his head split in two

192
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,478
that looks really
stupid and not cool?

193

You truly are heartless.

I didn't just happen to
lure you into the kitchen.

203
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:44,571
It's all part of the plan.

[FOXY]
That is to say,

205
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:48,342
I have a surprise
waiting for you

Do you want to
guess what it is?

208
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:53,247
It's nothing alive, at least.

That would be against
the rules, after all.

haven't learned yet,

once the effect of my

going to hit you at once.

It's not a costume, it's a

Let's finish him!

and punch combo!

I call this attack the
Slowpoke Ball Demon Coach!

didn't work on that fishman!

this Davy Back Fight.

his own territory!

Well that goes
without saying!

286
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:05,492
He's Luffy and
he has an afro!

287
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,695
I'd say being Luffy
should be more than enough.

288
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:08,896
Though the afro is nice.

289
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,132
Okay, you're gonna have to
explain this afro thing to me.

290

You're all acting
like it powers him up,

291
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:15,135
but that doesn't
make any sense.

292
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,737
I think this is the
longest combat round

293
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,038
I've ever seen!

294
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,707
The guy is made
of rubber after all.

295
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,443
He's made of rubber
and he has an afro!

Really, am I the only one
who doesn't get this?!

Of course, he does
have that afro and all.

is happening on the deck!

Who has the upper hand?

305
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,497
Or perhaps the battle
has ended with a bang

306
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,499
and only one fighter remains!

it looks like Straw Hat

to burn someone like that!

all odds, Straw Hat is up!

down for the count,

but the fight goes on!
