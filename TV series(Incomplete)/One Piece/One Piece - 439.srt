1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,700
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:41,469
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:44,739
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:47,642
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:50,445
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:52,213
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:55,183
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,019
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,521
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,189
of the World Government,

47
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:05,260
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

48
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:08,062
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

49
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:11,266
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

50
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:14,435
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

51
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:18,673
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

52
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:25,079
[NARRATOR] After being
separated from his crew,

53
00:03:25,113 --> 00:03:28,149
Luffy set out to rescue
his captured brother, Ace.

54
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:31,686
To do so, he snuck into the
government prison, Impel Down.

55
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,091
[MAGELLAN] Consider this
your punishment, child.

56
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,627
There's no way to neutralize
the amount of poison

57
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:41,763
your body has absorbed.

58
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,934
[BON CLAY screams]

59
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:51,339
[LUFFY] What do you think
you're doing to my friend, Bon?

60
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:54,142
Leave him...

61
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:56,711
...alone!

62
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:01,416
[NARRATOR] After fighting
off the Army Wolves,

63
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,384
Luffy and Bon Clay
lost consciousness,

64
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:06,421
and were carried away
by the mysterious Inazuma.

65
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:10,525
When Bon awoke, he found
himself in a most queer place.

66
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:12,794
[IVANKOV]
I bid you welcome.

67
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:19,133
To Impel Down
Level 5.5, bitches!

68
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:22,770
A secret garden
for all y'all prisoners! Ahh!

69
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,807
This is New Kama Land!

70
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,576

00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:32,647
[LUFFY]
"Luffy's Treatment Begins.

Move it, sister!

82
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:41,249
I said, Hee-haw!

It's him.

Hee! Haaa...

[CROWD cheering, applauding]

89
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,819
[IVANKOV] I guess I got
a little too excited

dancing and cutting loose.
I-I'm getting... dizzy...

91
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:23,357
[PATRON C]
Iva, are you all right?

92
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:27,528
[IVANKOV]
I think I'm gonna collapse now.

93
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:29,664
Then again, maybe I won't! Ha!

94
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:30,832
[PATRON D]
You were joking?

95
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:33,434
[PATRON E]
You sure fooled me!

96
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:38,406
Unless I'm mistaken, you're Iva,
the Miracle Worker, aren't you?

97
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,374
Oh, goodness me!

98
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:43,244
So, you've heard about
little old moi, have you?

99

Hey, watch your mouth!

100

Show some respect
when you're talk to Iva!

101

He's royalty, pal!

102
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:50,818
You gotta bow down before
the queen of New Kama!

Hush, now, my little candies!

106
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,666
I appreciate the admiration,
but don't sweat the small stuff.

107
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,035
I'm not worried about
silly things like labels.

108
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:10,471
People can call me
whatever they like.

109
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:12,473
They can even call me "Dookie."

110
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:16,711
Never call me "Dookie"!

111
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:18,279

[PATRON G]
You got me again!

00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:23,384
Is this really Iva,
the Miracle Worker?

114

The same one that I've worshiped
from afar for oh so many years?

Never call me "Dookie"! Ha-ha!

[PRISONER]
I've been looking for you!

121
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:53,815
You were the Queen of Kama
Bakka Kingdom, weren't you?

122
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:58,519
About 15 years ago, my father,
who was the king of my homeland,

123
00:07:58,553 --> 00:08:01,556
visited that country
of yours and then he--

[growls]

125
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,792

Do you have any idea
how ashamed I was?

129
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,700
His family and
his country were ruined!

130
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:25,771
I fell from my princely status
to nothing but a lowly pirate!

131
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,707
But all the days
I spent suffering

132
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,408
in this living hell
are worth it

133
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,546

who destroyed my life!

Don't do it! Where did you
even get that thing?

137

Oh, no! Don't point that at me!

138
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,061
Have mercy! I'm fragile!

If you shoot me
with that, I'll die!

You'll kill me!
You can't kill me!

How 'bout some Death Wink?

able to turn back that bullet?

to become a woman?

00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:13,105
You could become a woman
or become a man. Hee-haw!

178
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,508
Or maybe you could be both!

179
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,177
You should be able
to decide for yourself!

180
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,211
Right?

[IVANKOV]
Hee-haw!

182
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,822
That which you call gender
is a label!

183
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,991
It's nothing but a border!

184
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,861
I have no need for it.
No, everyone here is beyond it!

185
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,932
Hee-haw! We've all crossed over
that silly border,

186
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:43,002
which means you're looking
at the new human race!

187
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,638
New Kama!

188
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,976
[IVANKOV]
This is the garden of freedom!

189
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:57,116

He turned that guy into a woman!

This is the real deal!
He truly is a Miracle Worker!

195
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,704
I bid you welcome.

196
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,707
Perhaps, you'd like
to join in on the fun now?

The poor thing's embarrassed!

She's got a long way to go

205
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,158
before becoming
a proper citizen of New Kama.

Huh?

208
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,830
What is it, Bon Boy?

209
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,267
It's an honor to meet you, Iva!

210
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,137
I never stopped believing
you were still alive!

211
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:56,642
I'm so glad I found you!
You have no idea!

212
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,812
If you would hear it,
I have a favor to ask of you.

213
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,013
A favor?

214
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,082
My dear friend
was poisoned by Magellan!

215
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,117
Can you please save his life?

216
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,752
No antidote can help him!

217
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,389
He's lying there dying and
there's nothing I can do!

218
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,358
Please, I'm begging you!

219
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,160
I'll give you my life!

[BON CLAY]
Hmm?

224
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,844
[IVANKOV]
Did you stop to wonder

225
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,914
why we treated your injuries
in the first place?

226
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,817
To be quite honest,
I didn't notice.

227
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,319
We're all just
prisoners down here.

228
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,188
We don't have the means
to simply take in

229
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,924
and care for anyone
that we happen to find injured.

230
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,992
We're not nearly so kind.

231
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,864
[IVANKOV] You see,
I took you in and treated you

232
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,033
because your friend
begged me to do it.

233
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,302
[gasps] Straw Boy did what?

234
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:04,710
[LUFFY groaning]

235
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,993
[IVANKOV] We've been watching
you boys on the monitor,

236
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,363
and I gotta say, I'm impressed.

237
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:27,366
I can't tell if you're lucky
or just plain crazy.

238
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,836
Either way, congratulations
on making it this far,

239
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,738

[LUFFY] He's my friend!
I can't let him die!

246
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,132
That's not something
just anyone would say.

Not when they're on
the verge of death.

248
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,803
I didn't know the flower
of friendship could bloom

249
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,972
in a hellhole like this.

250
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,174
But I do know that
if I didn't help him,

251
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,177
I'd be no better than
a demon in human guise.

Actually, I made these with wax.

266
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,010
So, technically, they should be
called old-fashioned wax stilts,

267
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:27,378
or maybe
new-fashioned wax stilts!

can these beasts keep this up?

Like that's gonna stop them!

We've gotta get off this floor

00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:39,590
or we're never going
to lose these things!

of his treatment, but I assure
you that's part of the process.

284

We've locked him
away for safety.

Ten years of your life.

That's what it's
going to cost you,

290
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:58,435
if I administer this treatment.
It's a high price,

291
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:01,738
but that poison is serious,
Straw Hat Boy.

292
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:05,275
Fine by me.

293
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:07,578
Just so we're clear,
this is a high-risk treatment

294
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:10,347
and there's no guarantee
that it'll save your life.

295
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,315
In your current condition,

296
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:13,817
you have absolutely
no chance of survival.

297
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:15,886
The best I can do for you
through this process

298
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,722
is increase that chance
to two or three percent.

299
00:18:18,755 --> 00:18:21,291
What you face right now
is a battle the likes of which

300
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:23,193
you have never fought before.

301
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,463
You must temper that will
of yours to emerge victorious.

302
00:18:26,497 --> 00:18:29,833
If the poison wins,
you will most assuredly die.

303
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:32,369
But, if your spirit wins,
you walk away.

304
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,805
It's as simple as that!

305
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:37,774
All right, then. I wish you
a pleasant journey.

306
00:18:37,808 --> 00:18:40,677

Straw Boy has been wailing in
agony like that for ten hours?

314
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:47,711
Spirit and hormones.

315
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:50,514
These are the vital forces
of the human body.

316
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:53,884
Combined, the two bring forth
a tremendous healing potential.

[LUFFY screaming]

318
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,957
[IVANKOV] I have drawn out
his latent immunity

319
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,492
and changed his body
to enable him to battle

320
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:04,228
with the deadly poison.

321
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:07,397
Only time will tell which
of the two of them is stronger.

322
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:09,700
Within that battlefield
of a body lies destruction

323
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:13,837
and recovery raging away
at extraordinary speeds.

324
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,974
He will survive only if he
can withstand all that pain,

325
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,376
and escaping from death
does not come cheap.

It's gonna tear him apart!

from the inside out!

there, it was a living corpse!

I'm begging you, here!
Don't let him suffer like that.

You have to do
something, please!

any idea what it takes

to strive against
one's own mortality?

To face the ultimate odds?

350
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:41,425
I'm not a god, or an angel,
or anything like that.

351
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,026
A "Miracle Worker"?

352
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,062
You can call me whatever
the hell you want,

353
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,930
but the truth of
the matter is this:

354
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:48,398
I could never save a fool

355
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,335
who doesn't have the will
to save himself.

356
00:21:51,368 --> 00:21:53,103
I saved an impoverished country,

357
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:56,406
and a country that was left
in ruin after defeat in war.

358
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,474
But, in both cases,

359
00:21:57,507 --> 00:22:00,677
all I did was draw out
their own spirit to live.

360
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:03,413
That can only happen to people
who have the courage

361
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,382
to keep on fighting!

362
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:08,685
Making miracles is never easy!

363
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:18,995
[LUFFY]
Ace!

364
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:50,994
[LUFFY groaning]

365
00:22:51,027 --> 00:22:58,402
[LUFFY screaming]

366
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,653
[NARRATOR] Luffy braves
Iva's agonizing treatment,

367
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,556
even though it has little
chance of actually succeeding.

368
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:23,059
Unable to help in any other way,
Bon Clay cheers for his friend,

369
00:23:23,093 --> 00:23:25,896
praying that his strength
of will can prevail.

370
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:27,764
Meanwhile, the guards
of Impel Down

371
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:30,600
begin to escort Ace
to his place of execution.

372
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:32,068
[LUFFY]
On the next, One Piece:

373
00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:35,839
"Believe in Miracles! Bon
Clay's Cries From the Heart"!

374
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,141
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
