and ruin Vergo's reputation,
then that suits my ends.

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:02.995
One catch.

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:07.233
I need you to forget all you
heard about me and Joker.

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:11.837
That's not a petty request.
It's a condition.

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:15.174
You give me that,
and I give you your life.

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:17.176
Sound like a deal?

00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:34.060
[gasping]

00:11:37.296 --> 00:11:39.131
[LUFFY]
I can't see anything.

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:40.666
[LAW, SMOKER grunt, gasp]

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.437
I wonder what's
goin' on down there.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.908
Ha! All right! No more waiting--
I'm gonna go see!

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:50.609
--[LAW] Stop that.
--[LUFFY] Yahoo!

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:53.045
Hey, what are you doing?

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:55.548
That idiot doesn't even
know the plan!

00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:58.884
[FRANKY] Yeah, shoulda
kept him chained up, then.

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:01.921
Luffy does something crazy the
second your back is turned.

00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:02.855
Every time.

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:07.593
[LUFFY laughing, gasping]

00:12:07.626 --> 00:12:09.328
[LAW growls]
That moron!

00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:12.732
[LUFFY grunting]

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:15.968
[LUFFY]
Hey, Traffy! [laughs]

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:19.872
How're we supposed
to get inside here?

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:21.073
[LAW growling]

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:22.608
[FRANKY]
Quick question, brother.

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:23.843
Do you need my help?

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:26.712
'Cause I'd really rather go
check up on the Sunny.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.848
Do what you want.

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:32.184
Sweet! See ya later!

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:35.287
Coup de Boo!

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:37.189
I'm coming for ya, Sunny!

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:41.193
[LUFFY] Good luck, Franky!
Aw, that stinks...

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:48.534
[SMOKER]
Eh? And what's that look for?

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:52.138
Hey! What're you waitin'
for, Traffy? Let's go!

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:54.840
[growls, exhales]

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:57.576
[laughing]

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:17.296
[MARINE T]
Hey, you there, Smokey?

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:20.332
Are you okay, Captain?
Can you hear us?

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:23.569
[MARINE U] They're gonna die and
there's nothing we can do!

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:26.605
Oh, no. Guys, look!

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.140
[MARINES gasp]

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:31.243
[MARINE C] The poison gas is
gonna be here any minute!

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:39.251
We're gonna end up just
like those poor bastards

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:41.353
we saw in the video!

00:13:44.523 --> 00:13:46.959
Crap, that's not good.
We gotta get inside!

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.928
And in a real hurry, too!

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.030
[MARINES chattering]

00:13:51.063 --> 00:13:52.698
[MARINE V]
Open the door!

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:55.467
Please! We can't
die here, damn it!

00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:57.803
[BROOK, SANJI, ZORO, KIN'EMON
screaming]

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.905
[BROOK, SANJI, ZORO, KIN'EMON]
Run away!

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:03.375
[BROOK, SANJI, ZORO, KIN'EMON
screaming]

00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:05.144
[KIN'EMON] However feverishly
I paddle my legs,

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:07.146
it draws closer still!

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:09.315
[BROOK] Sadly, it seems the
dragon is much more adept

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:10.616
at running than we are!

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:13.619
[ZORO] We gotta catch up,
so we can fly outta here!

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:14.887
[SANJI]
I can't keep up.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.455
Just a little bit
longer, Sanji!

00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:18.157
I don't know if I can.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.492
Nami isn't built for
this kind of abuse.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.728
Her lungs can't take any more.

00:14:22.761 --> 00:14:25.898
Dammit, my chest is really
starting to hurt.

00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:29.735
Her chest... I mean--

00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:33.305
[gasps] Boobies!

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:36.742
[SANJI yelling]

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:37.977
[SANJI]
I caught it!

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.647
If it's that easy, you should've
done it in the first place!

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:48.387
[NAMI] The smoke is
closing in on us, fast!

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.489
[USOPP]
Its coloring is really creepy!

00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:51.891
I feel like I'm coming
down with something

00:14:51.924 --> 00:14:53.392
just looking at that thing.

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:55.594
Hang in there a little
longer, Brownie.

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:59.999
I know you're injured, so thank
you for carrying us like this.

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:01.834
You guys are bite-sized
compared to me.

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:04.436
This is nothing. And besides,
I gotta get back

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.938
and rescue my men, either way.

00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:08.240
Yeah, and we gotta help
those kids, too.

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:11.043
I just hope we can make it there
before they eat that candy.

00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:14.179
Look down! Do you see that?

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:18.150
See? We're not the only ones
running from the gas.

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:20.853
[USOPP]
A dragon?

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:23.188
[NAMI]
Uh. Wait, is that...?

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:27.126
[BROOK, SANJI, ZORO, KIN'EMON
screaming]

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:28.260
[BOTH scream]

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.996
[BROOK] I could do with a little
less turbulence, please!

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.132
[DRAGON A roars]

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:35.334
[growls] Stop running
and fly already!

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:38.570
How foolish of you to rely on
the aid of this unholy beast!

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:40.706
Show some gratitude, will ya?

00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:43.108
We got a free ride on this
lizard thanks to the power

00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:47.746
of Nami's sexy body. In fact,
just thinking about it, I...

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.448
If you don't shut up,
I'll give you something

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:51.216
to really bleed about!

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.519
[KIN'EMON] The poison gas
will soon overtake us!

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:55.487
[BROOK]
My arm muscles are giving out!

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:57.156
In fact, they're already gone!

00:15:57.189 --> 00:16:00.859
Why, look at them!
All that's left is bone!

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:02.594
[BROOK gasping]

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:03.462
[ZORO, SANJI]
That's not good!

00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:07.366
[BROOK screaming]

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.001
[USOPP grunts]

00:16:09.034 --> 00:16:10.202
We got him!

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:11.737
That was a close one, huh?

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:12.871
It's Usopp!

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.340
Nami, you're okay!

00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:15.674
[USOPP]
Come on, just keep moving!

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:17.309
[DRAGON A squawking]

00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:19.878
[ZORO] Nice timing, but what the
hell are you guys doing here?

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:21.880
[NAMI] I've got a mountain
of questions myself,

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:23.849
but save them.
First things first--

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:26.585
We gotta make it to that lab,
or we're done for!

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:28.354
I know!

00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:32.057
[SANJI]
Our taxi's runnin' outta gas.

00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:34.860
We could try running again,
but I don't think we'd make it!

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:37.896
Jump off! And ride on my back!

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.899
[KIN'EMON] You have my
gratitude, bearded one!

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:46.472
[screaming]

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:48.173
Oh! Very good!

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:50.209
Let's just hope I can hold on!

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:51.677
Nice work!

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.312
You're useful after all!

00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:55.547
You people are the worst!

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.216
[BROWNBEARD screams]

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:08.994
[MARINE W]
Faster, faster!

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.630
[MARINE H]
We're all gonna die!

00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:14.133
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!
Dammit! Dammit!

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:16.068
Open already!

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.841
Uhh! Guys, we're too late.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:26.011
The gas, it's coming
over the mountain!

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.179
[gasping]

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:30.015
[MARINES chattering]

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:42.494
Help us! You can't let
us die, not like this!

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:46.198
[MARINE J] That gas is gonna
swallow us up any second now.

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:49.068
Smokey and the Captain are
trapped up there, too.

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:51.570
We're all gonna die!

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:53.672
[whimpering]

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:14.793
[MARINES gasping]

00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:16.962
[MARINES cheer]

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:19.898
[MARINE X]
Look! The shutter's opening!

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:21.700
I don't know how the hell
they got that thing open,

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:23.235
but this is a big emergency!

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:25.537
[SUBORDINATE B] Did some moron
in here touch the lever?

00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:28.474
[SUBORDINATE A] Crap!
Those G-5 guys are pouring in!

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:30.275
What's going on here?!

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:31.643
[SUBORDINATE D]
Look! Up there!

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.045
[SUBORDINATE C gasps]

00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:43.555
No way!

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:48.961
[SUBORDINATE C] That's...
That's Vice Admiral Smoker!

00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:53.732
The Warlord Trafalgar Law!

00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:58.604
And the famous pirate
Straw Hat Luffy!

00:18:58.637 --> 00:18:59.838
How are they here?

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:02.474
I thought the Master
had them locked up!

00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:03.775
[ROBIN giggles]

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:07.045
We made it.
All of our men are inside.

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:10.182
All right. Let's see if we
can get my heart back.

00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:12.117
[laughing]

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.186
This is gonna be awesome!

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:17.656
I'm working with pirates?
How shameful.

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:19.658
[MARINES murmuring]

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:21.827
Smokey! Captain, too!

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.428
They made it after all, guys!

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:26.732
That's the last of us!
Time to close it up!

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:39.878
I guess all that crying
was for nothing!

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:40.979
Huh?

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:44.249
[MARINE M] What's that
in front of the poison?

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:46.985
[BROWNBEARD screaming]

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:52.925
There's the lab!
We're gonna be okay!

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:57.663
[ALL screaming]

00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:59.698
[USOPP, NAMI laugh]

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:02.301
[USOPP] Huh...? Oh, no, wait!
No, no, no, no!

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:04.036
[ALL screaming]

00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:06.271
Are you kidding me?

00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:08.207
No! We're so close!

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.410
Have mercy! We're all
about to die out here!

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:15.981
We're dead, after all that!
And we tried so hard, too!

00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:18.183
[BOTH crying]

00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:20.652
I seem to be giving up
the ghost already.

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:22.054
I'll have company soon!

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:23.555
[KIN'EMON]
Huh?

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:28.227
[ZORO] Yo, Kin'emon!
Think you can cut through iron?

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.562
Most certainly. Have no fear.

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:32.931
Hey, Brownbeard!
Let's keep up the pace!

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:34.600
Yeah? To what end?

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:37.202
You want me to dash my
brains out on that wall?

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:39.771
Would you rather slow down
and eat poison gas?

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:42.741
[ALL]
No way! No how!

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:50.182
I got nothin' to lose!

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:52.384
Here I go!

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:55.354
Not like we really have a
Plan B in a situation like this.

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:57.656
[USOPP grunts]
It's do or die now!

00:20:57.689 --> 00:21:00.092
But that's nothing
new for us, huh?

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:01.893
Are you ready to do this?

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:03.495
Of course!

00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:14.973
[ZORO, KIN'EMON grunting]

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:20.445
[BROWNBEARD yells]

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:21.813
[ZORO growls]

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:23.682
[KIN'EMON growls]

00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:25.717
[BROWNBEARD yelling]

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:26.952
[USOPP yells]

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:28.186
[NAMI grunting]

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.721
[BROOK]
Ya-ha!

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:30.956
[SANJI gasping]

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:33.025
[laughs] Hey, Zoro!

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:35.394
You certainly do know how
to make an entrance.

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:38.030
[GROUP chattering, laughing]

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:41.033
[MARINES gasping]

00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:49.841
[MARINES] Now there's a giant
hole in the shutter!

00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:51.910
[LUFFY]
Hey, guys! I'm here, too!

00:21:51.943 --> 00:21:53.111
[NAMI, USOPP]
Luffy!

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.479
Good to see you!

00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:55.514
Heh.

00:21:55.547 --> 00:21:56.815
What's up?

00:21:56.848 --> 00:21:58.116
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:02.387
[LUFFY inhales]

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:05.257
Everyone's here?

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.894
Okay! It's time to party!

00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:18.837
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hat
Pirates managed to escape

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.440
Land of the Dead and reunite
for their next move.

00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:23.942
Unfortunately for them,
the only escape route

00:22:23.975 --> 00:22:25.177
is through Building R.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.746
However, despite the odds
that are stacked against them,

00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:29.514
Luffy and his companions
pull together

00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:31.550
a dramatic counter attack.

00:22:31.583 --> 00:22:33.352
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:34.953
"Get to Building R!

00:22:34.986 --> 00:22:37.589
The Pirate Alliance's
Great Advance!"

00:22:37.622 --> 00:22:40.459
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
