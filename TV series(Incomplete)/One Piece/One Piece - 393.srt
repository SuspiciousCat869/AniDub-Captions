1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,366
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,994
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:45,540
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,546
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,340
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,719
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,971
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,516
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,686
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,898
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,442
[NARRATOR]
To reach Fishman Island,

48
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,902
Luffy and the Crew
began searching

49
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:17,822
for a coating craftsman
on the Sabaody Archipelago.

50
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,868
Unfortunately, the area is also
home to the Celestial Dragons,

51
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,453
world nobles powerful enough

52
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,872
to hold influence
over Navy Headquarters.

53
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,499
A number of other formidable
pirates headed for the New World

54
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,710
were also lurking nearby.

55
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,961
You do have me a little afraid

56
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,422
for the old coating
mechanic pirate guy.

57
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,840
This town sounds pretty rough.

58
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,345
[SHAKKY] Oh, you've
got nothing to worry about.

59
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,930
Trust me,
Rayleigh's all right.

60
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,390
He's a hundred times
stronger than you.

61
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,602
[LUFFY]
The Target is Camie!

62
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,939
The Looming Clutches of a
Professional Kidnapper!

63
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,654
[LUFFY]
You ready, Chopper?

64
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,321
[CHOPPER]
Yeah!

65
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,447
[SHAKKY]
Just so you know,

66
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,616
I'm sure the Navy is aware
that all you up-and-coming

67
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,410
heavy-hitting pirates
have made landfall here.

68
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,497
I'd keep an eye out for anything
suspicious, if I were you.

69
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,333
[BROOK]
Well that's not good.

70
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,418
So you're saying they
could strike at any time

71
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,503
from out of nowhere?

72
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,088
Yes, but you
might be in luck.

73
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,923
In addition to the
usual troublemakers

74
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,132
around these parts,

75
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,969
with all the other pirates
landing here at the same time.

76
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,597
Navy Headquarters probably
has its hands full right now.

77
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,725
Unless something
especially problematic happens,

78
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,061
the Navy won't waste
major military resources

79
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,521
on checking it out.

80
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,398
In other words:
keep your heads down,

81
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,067
try not to cause any trouble,
and you should be fine, okay?

82
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,819
Sure! I understand.

83
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,446
Thanks a lot!
You were a real big help.

84
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,616
Maybe we'll see you again after
we find the boat-coating guy!

85
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,497
If you can find him.

86
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,806
[LUFFY]
We're here! Sabaody Park!

87
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,058
[CHOPPER, HACHI, CAMIE, BROOK]
Yay!

88
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,688
[PARK-GOERS screaming]

89
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,609
Aw, man!
This place looks fun!

90
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,528
Focus!
Remember why we're here!

91
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,738
[LUFFY]
I remember!

92
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,698
That lady said this is where
we should look for him, right?

93
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,951
[PAPPAGU] Only if we couldn't
find him in the lawless area!

94
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,119
It's the Ferris Wheel!

95
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,538
I've never seen it
from this close before!

96
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,205
[LUFFY]
All right!

97
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,083
Listen up!
It's fun time!

98
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,835
[PAPPAGU] You're not
even trying to find him!

99
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,878
Yay!

100
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,547
Camie! You are forbidden
to step inside that place!

101
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,883
Absolutely forbidden!

102
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,638
[BROOK] My, what a lovely
and leisurely ride this is!

103
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,557
Yohoho! Oh, and
look at this view!

104
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,808
How relaxing!

105
00:05:52,977 --> 00:06:03,571
[screaming]

106
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,839
Awesome!

107
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,050
Let's do it again!
Let's do it again!

108
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,010
That was your first time.
Were you scared, Camie?

109
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,597
Yeah! I was
scared out of my mind!

110
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,100
But it was so fun! I loved it!

111
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,103
I've never had so much
fun in my whole life!

112
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,020
Come on!
You had it easy!

113
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,647
I was in the very front!

114
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,148
[zooming noise]

115
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,441
[PAPPAGU]
We were going so fast

116
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,901
my face was about
to fly right off!

117
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,947
My heart nearly
beat out of my chest.

118
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,741
Not that I have
a heart, of course.

119
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:58,626
[laughing]

120
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,551
[BROOK]
Yoho! Yes.

121
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,470
Gentle rides like this
one are more my style.

122
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,641
This way, I can still enjoy the
lovely view without having to--

123
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:19,772
[screaming]

124
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,940
[CHOPPER]
Look!

125
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,667
[LUFFY]
Faster, faster, faster!

126
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,172
Spin! Spin!

127
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,175
Faster! Faster! Faster!

128
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,720
Spin!

129
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,556
Faster! Faster!

130
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,850
[screaming]

131
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,685
[RIDE GUY] What the heck
is wrong with you people?

132
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,729
Who in their right minds
would spin that hard?

133
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,563
Are you crazy?

134
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,857
Who's gonna pay
for all this damage?

135
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,114
Oh, wow! We're so high up!

136
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,086
[CAMIE]
Look, Luffy!

137
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,463
They're selling ice cream!

138
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,381
[LUFFY]
For real?

139
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,009
[CAMIE] From up here,
everyone looks so tiny!

140
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,345
[CAMIE]
Look! Over here!

141
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,930
The ocean!

142
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:34,972
[LUFFY]
Cool!

143
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,437
It's all so beautiful!

144
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,942
It's the most amazing
thing I've ever seen.

145
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,403
Hey, what's the
crying all about?

146
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,655
It's just...

147
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,325
I've dreamed of this moment
ever since I was a little girl.

148
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,239
I've never been so
high up in the air before!

149
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,490
I'll always remember this day.

150
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,284
Thank you so much!

151
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,910
I couldn't have
come here without you.

152
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,246
Hatchin and Pappagu only
let me come to this place

153
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,332
because they knew
you'd keep me safe.

154
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,096
Nyuu!
I gotta admit,

155
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,266
I'm probably every bit as
happy as Camie is right now.

156
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,144
Every mer-child and fish-kid
dreams of coming to this place,

157
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,271
though not many of us
get to really do it.

158
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,314
So high!

159
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,273
So high!

160
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,524
So very high!

161
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,485
Let's ride this one!

162
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,653
Gondola!

163
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,946
Yeah!

164
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,241
[cheering]

165
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,452
[screaming]

166
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,288
[laughing]

167
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,294
[BROOK screaming]

168
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,514
[CAMIE] Come on!
Let's go inside!

169
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,556
[LUFFY]
Yeah!

170
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,184
Yohohoho!

171
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,436
[CHILD screaming]

172
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,591
[BOUNTY HUNTER 391A]
I'm telling you.

173
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,510
They were crazy strong!

174
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,513
[PETERMAN] Sounds like
you had a rough time.

175
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,349
So what is this
"proposition" of yours?

176
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,268
Right. I'm sorry, sir.

177
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,352
You see, Master Peterman,

178
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,062
I think the girl
with Straw Hat Luffy

179
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,480
might be a mermaid.

180
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,649
I noticed something
when I saw her before.

181
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,238
[HACHI]
Leave them alone!

182
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,158
Camie! Pappagu!

183
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,242
[BOUNTY HUNTER 391A]
After she fell to the ground,

184
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,577
her shoe came off.

185
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:28,080
When it did, I saw
a fin instead of a foot.

186
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,754
[PETERMAN] But these strong
companions you mentioned

187
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:38,257
sound like they could
be a lot of trouble.

188
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:38,966
Nonetheless.

189
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,718
A mermaid spotted on dry land

190
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,803
is certainly a
golden opportunity.

191
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,556
They're impossible
to catch in open water.

192
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,266
I appreciate all the info.

193
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,435
You came to the right man.

194
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,436
And for that info,

195
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,397
you can have 10 percent
of her selling price.

196
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,440
Well...

197
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,567
We were really hoping for 20.

198
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,738
[BOUNTY HUNTERS] I mean,
uh, 10 percent is plenty!

199
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,583
[PAPPAGU] Wait here
a minute, okay, Camie?

200
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,627
Yeah, okay!

201
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,796
But get something yummy
for me, too, all right?

202
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,737
[FALLEN MONK PIRATE 393A]
High Priest Urouge.

203
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,113
Look over there.

204
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,784
My, my. What a sight.

205
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,133
[UROUGE]
A Celestial Dragon, huh?

206
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,177
To think they'd wander
around the lawless area

207
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,804
without a care in the world.

208
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,973
I don't like this,

209
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,601
but our only choice is to
kneel and let him pass on by.

210
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,783
Shalria and Father left me.

211
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,493
And in this cesspool.

212
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,247
Where did they wander
off to this time?

213
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,748
Well, we do know
their final destination,

214
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,166
so rest easy.

215
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,793
We'll meet up
with them soon enough.

216
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,172
This is all your fault!

217
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,674
You're slow as a turtle!

218
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,342
You can't even crawl gracefully!

219
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,511
What a horrible ride you are!

220
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,515
You irritate me to no end,
you pathetic worm!

221
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,190
Hey! You!

222
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,443
What are you doing there?

223
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,736
Why are you moving?

224
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,863
You should be still and bowing!

225
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,243
I'm so very sorry!

226
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,703
Please overlook this, sir!

227
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,457
This man needs urgent care!
We're racing against time.

228
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,542
The hospital is just up ahead!

229
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,795
[CHARLOSS]
Yes, I see.

230
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,465
This is very bad, indeed.

231
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,549
Well, in that case.

232
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,259
You must be swift.

233
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,895
[CHARLOSS] And put
him out of his misery!

234
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,750
[CHARLOSS] And put
him out of his misery!

235
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,922
[DOCTOR 393A]
I beg you, stop!

236
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,173
[MARIE]
Oh, no!

237
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,676
Look at that.

238
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,220
Now that is one selfish Noble.

239
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,814
[CHARLOSS] Tell me.
What's more important?

240
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:25,818
Showing me courtesy or
a mere commoner's life?

241
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,695
Every commoner
owes their very existence

242
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,655
to the Celestial Dragons.

243
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,685
It's settled.

244
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,729
I'm making you my new wife.

245
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,896
Very good, sir.

246
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,732
I shall make arrangements
to send her to the Holy Land

247
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,358
as your 13th wife.

248
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,443
By the by...

249
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,945
I've grown quite weary
of wives 1 through 5 lately.

250
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,364
Have them sent back to
live with the commoners.

251
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,699
Of course, sir. As you wish.

252
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,742
Please, don't do this!

253
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,534
I beg you!

What are you doing?

255
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,369
She's my fiancée!

256
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,370
You can't just come here and--

257
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,413
[gunshot]

258
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,918

when you should be kneeling!

How could you?

00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,773
Somebody help him!
Help him, please!

00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,483
He's going to die!

Someone! Please!

266
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:55,657
These Celestial Dragons
are as wicked as the rumors say.

267
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,700
What was that?

268
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,620
You would have these
people act out against me?

[MARIE] Please,
let go of me! Stop it!

270
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,629
Take her ahead
to the harbor for me.

Yes, sir!

273
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,427
I recognize him, Captain!

00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,597
That guy is Pirate Hunter
Zoro from the East Blue!

275
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,473
Why is he walking

276
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,432
right down the middle
of the street?

277
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,559
Don't he know you don't
do that around here?

278
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,561
He's gonna cause
a lot of trouble!

279
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,502
Hey, what's the matter?

280
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,546
Do you need some
directions or something?

281
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,722
What in the hell does
he think he's doing?

282
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,820
[ZORO]
A kid?

[BONNEY]
Big brother!

285
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,371
Why'd you have to die?
Why'd you leave me?

286

No!

Just stay still, tough guy.

[BONNEY]
Big brother!

290
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,922
Why'd you stand up
to a Celestial Dragon?

291
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,383
You know that can
only end in death!

293
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,679
I guess I actually
shot him, huh?

294
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,891
Thought for sure he dodged at
the last second, but ah well.

295
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,018
Must be imagining things.

296
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,732
[CHARLOSS]
Well, whatever.

297
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,609
As long as he's dead.

298
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,211

did you get in my way?

00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,547
I just saved your
life back there! Moron!

301

What the heck were you thinking,

00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,800
attacking a
Celestial Dragon like that?

303
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,178
You'll bring admirals here!

304
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,804
What's with
all this tomato juice?

305
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,139
It's to make you look dead!

306
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,016
And unless you want
to be that way for real,

307
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,728
Mister Troublemaker, you better
obey the unwritten pirate rules!

308
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,980
What are you talking about?

309
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:32,940
Hey, wait a minute.

310
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,149
There was a kid here.

311
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,400
Where'd she go?

312
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,487
[BONNEY] Don't get the rest
of us caught up in your trouble!

313
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,780
Are you messed up in the head?

314
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,614
[ZORO]
No, I'm fine.

315
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,573
I didn't hit my head.

316
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,282
[BONNEY]
You numbskull!

317
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,159
I'm talking about the inside!

318
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,911
Geez, what a dumbass.

319
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,621
How have you survived this long?

320
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,539
Well thanks to
Jewelry Bonney over there,

321
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,042
we managed to avoid
the worst-case scenario.

322
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,752
That man is Pirate Hunter Zoro,

323
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,462
a member of the
Straw Hat Pirates.

324
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,464
I heard their crew
was kinda wild,

325
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,049
but attacking a Dragon?

326
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,802
And in a public street
in broad daylight?

327
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,136
That's plain bonkers.

328
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,555
It's only natural
that he was saved.

329
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,600
I didn't see the shadow of
death upon him at this time.

330
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,893
I felt his bloodlust.

331
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,604
That guy'll cut you down
without a second thought.

332
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,981
He's a real monster.

333
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,817
A bounty of a hundred
and twenty million berries.

334
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,068
Doesn't seem like a lackey,

335
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,987
but he's number two
on the Straw Hats.

336
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,823
I guess that goes to show
the caliber of his Captain.

337
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,657
Right.

338
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,158
So... Where's
the nearest hospital?

339
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:25,701
[BONNEY]
Hospital?

340
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,577
This man needs a doctor.

341
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,704
He took a bullet.

342
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,997
[BONNEY]
What? Forget him!

343
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,791
He's a total stranger!

344
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,209
You've gotta be kidding me.

345
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,586
A pirate helping
out some random guy?

346
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,505
Never seen that before.

347
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,847
[laughing]

348
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,849
I saw something
when I went into town.

349
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,560
These bubble bicycle
things were flying around.

350
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,978
Yeah! I saw those, too!

351
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,812
Pretty cool, huh?

352
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:54,855
We should buy a couple!

353
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,149
I betcha those bikes
have a really smooth ride!

354
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,317
The snail.

355
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:58,984
It's probably Nami.

356
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,028
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

357
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,029
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL]
Click.

358
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,864
Hello, my beautiful Nami!

359
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,699
[CHOPPER]
Sanji! Sanji, it's Chopper!

360
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,326
Listen to me!

361
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,160
[CHOPPER]
Basically...

362
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,870
They had so many
kinds of ice cream.

363
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,664
We got caught up
and made a mistake!

364
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,207
Slow down.
You're not making any sense.

365
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,208
[CHOPPER]
Sanji!

366
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:20,547
It's terrible! Terrible!
What are we gonna do?

367
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,715
I dunno what you're saying.

368
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,884
Calm down. Just start over.

369
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,095
[CHOPPER]
It's Camie!

370
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,180
What's going on, Sanji?

371
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,557
[CHOPPER]
Camie's been kidnapped!

372
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,726
Wait, what did you say?

373
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,270
[CHOPPER] I think it was a group
of kidnappers working together!

374
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,065
People here capture and
sell merfolk and fishmen,

375
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,233
whoever they can profit off of!

376
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,818
Camie's gonna get sold!

377
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,113
She'll be a slave forever
and it's all our fault!

378
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,366
There are lots of Human
Shoppes on these islands,

379
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,743
so there's no telling
which one she'll be at

380
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,745
or when she'll be sold!

381
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,997
We don't even have
a clue who kidnapped her!

382
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,041
This place is gigantic.

383
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,125
We need to split up and start--

384
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:57,834
Don't move.

385
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,920
Tell me exactly where you are.

386
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,630
We'll come and meet you there.

387
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,756
[CHOPPER]
But... But we...

388
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:03,757
We know some experts

389
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,051
when it comes to this
sort of thing, remember?

390
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:11,306
I'm calling in the
Flying Fish Riders.

391
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,766
[FRANKY and USOPP]
What?

392
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,066
[DISCO]
A young mermaid came in?

393
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,777
It's been a while since we've
had such quality merchandise!

394
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,945
[CAMIE]
Let go of me!

395
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,780
[DISCO] She's a nice
and lively one, too!

396
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,781
All right, then!

397
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,783
Welcome the bidders
into the auction house!

398
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,202
Get ready for some
hot bidding wars, people!

399
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,955
[CAMIE]
Hatchin, please! Save me!

400
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,415
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

401
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,332
"Rescue Camie!

402
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,293
The Archipelago's
Lingering Dark History!"

403
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,921
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
