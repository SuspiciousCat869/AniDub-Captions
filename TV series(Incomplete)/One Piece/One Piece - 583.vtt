A horn?

[ZORO]
Boss?

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:31.824
That guy on the snail.

00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:34.260
He said somethin'
about a "Boss," too!

Someone's there.

Guess that's the boss.

[USOPP] The distress signal
was meant for him?

If that's the case, we don't
have anything to worry about.

This "Boss" guy's got bigger

Is he the samurai

If so, I'll make him pay.

Yep, I sure did, buddy.

I'm really a cyborg.

All right, now listen up,

exciting to have visitors,

but those people are
very dangerous.

You need to stay
away from them, okay?

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:23.662
Are you sure?

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:26.332
They seemed really nice
and friendly to me.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:27.600

I'm afraid they pulled one over

on you, sweetheart.

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:31.337
Hold on. You're sayin'
Mr. Robot's a bad guy?

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:32.171
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
That's right.

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:33.439
Same for the raccoon?

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:34.373
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
Uh-huh.

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:36.508
And the man with the
curly eyebrow, too?

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.244

Him, too, but there's no need

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:39.211
to be scared.

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:57.776
[gasping] Show yourself, fiend!

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:02.247
Huh?

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:09.921
[BROOK]
What?!

00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:13.158
It's... just a torso?

00:23:17.996 --> 00:23:20.866
[NARRATOR] Nami and Chopper race
through the forboding facility

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:23.101
in an effort to rescue
the imprisoned children,

00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:26.204
And Sanji and Franky are faced
with a difficult confrontation

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:27.272
of their own.

00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:29.541
Meanwhile, having grown
weary of being toyed with

00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:30.976
by the samurai torso,

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:33.378
Brook decides it's
time to retaliate.

00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:35.080
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.113 --> 00:23:36.782
"A Swordplay Showdown!

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:39.785
Brook Vs. the Mysterious
Torso Samurai!"

00:23:39.818 --> 00:23:42.687
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
