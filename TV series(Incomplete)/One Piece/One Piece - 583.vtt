00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:04.437
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:07.340
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:10.143
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.412
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.681
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.484
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:19.786
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.889
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.258

for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.495
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:47.734
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:50.403
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:53.540
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:55.475
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.844
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.877 --> 00:03:00.580
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.550
[NARRATOR]
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:06.753
a boy whose body became rubber

sets sail into the New World

the Straw Hat Pirates
depart for the deadly waters

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:26.172
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.841
Responding to a distress call,
Luffy and company

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:32.345
trek across the flaming
island of Punk Hazard.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:34.247
The crew members who
remained on the Sunny

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.118
were captured and taken to
a mysterious facility nearby.

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:42.622
I'm here to save my son's life!

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:45.592
And I would cut down anyone
who stands in my way!

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.593

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.228
[SUBORDINATE 582B]
Don't let them get away!

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:52.265
[FRANKY] Those're my friends.
Cut it out, will ya?

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:55.301

[SUBORDINATES

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:59.405
What the hell do
they want from us?

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.375
What?

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.776

Who're you?

Hello there, kids.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:15.655
[KIN'EMON]
What? There's children?

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.790

Where are we?

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.670
And what's with all the rugrats?

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:04.704
I don't know.

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:07.707
Maybe it's the island's
daycare or something?

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.542
Some of 'em look like giants.

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:11.444
They're the biggest
I've ever seen.

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.946
Did we drop anchor
on an island of giants?

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.849
[NAMI] No, because there are
regular-sized children, too.

00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:20.787
Okay, then it's some kinda
all-inclusive nursery?

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.589
There aren't any adults
here to supervise though.

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:26.726
Mocha? Who are they?

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.828
I've never seen them before.

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:31.731
Ah! You must be the ones
who were frozen!

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:32.965
How did you escape?

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.900
Frozen?

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:35.702
What is she talking about?

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:38.538
The mystery of the
island deepens.

Heh. Aw, man. These

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:20.913
And it's all 'cause of my
armored physique, huh?

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:23.249
What did she mean by
"the ones who were frozen"?

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.396
Whoa. Close call.

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:38.931

not interested in me.

Do you know a child

I am looking for my boy!

That was scary!

Run! Hurry!

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:43.963
[SANJI] Wait, don't go!
We've got questions about this--

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:45.932
Come back here!

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.433
Hey! Shut up!

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.302
We're tryin' to get
information outta them!

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:51.871
And they won't talk
if you scare 'em!

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.373
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
The door to the Biscuit Room

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:55.508
is open!

00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:00.179
[FRANKY] They're coming
for us! Let's get movin'.

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.182
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
It must be those pirates!

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:05.218
We can't let them get away!

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:14.794
[SANJI] What kind of
facility is this place?

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.162
You've gotta tell us!

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:18.498
You must aid me in
my search for Momonosuke!

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:20.233
[BOYS scream]

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.134
I thought we told you
to keep your mouth shut!

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.470
I've been disgraced
as a samurai,

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:27.340
all because I was
attacked by a woman!

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:30.476
What?! Oh, quit your whining,
you chauvinist pig!

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.878
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
I knew it was them!

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:33.012
[SUBORDINATE 583B]
I got 'em!

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:38.885
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
No, wait! Hold your fire.

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:40.553
We can't use guns or explosives,

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:43.289
and let's keep the
gas grenades to a minimum.

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:46.993
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
The master would be furious

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.295
if we were to hurt
one of the children.

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:57.169
[USOPP]
Uh, Luffy.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.205
Take a good,
long look at this lake.

00:08:59.238 --> 00:09:01.340
Are you sure you wanna cross it?

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.174
[LUFFY]
Uh-huh!

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.609
You gotta be kiddin' me!

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:06.045
It's gonna be impossible
to get across that thing!

00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:08.848
Half's on fire,
the other half's frozen!

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.051
Then the temperature of
the water should be perfect.

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.286
--[USOPP gasps]
--Let's swim.

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:14.353
You're crazy!

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:17.356
Robin and I can't get wet,
so you know what to do!

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:23.696
[USOPP] Are you tryin' to imply
that we should carry you across?

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:26.299
Surely you can't be serious.

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.134
Stop looking at me like that!

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:30.970
Please, do you really think
Zoro's gonna agree to--

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:32.371
Aw, crap. He's already
stretching for it.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:33.806
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.575
[sighs] Actually.

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:38.811
If we don't cross, we'll have
to go all the way around.

00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:40.479
I've got no choice.

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:42.081
In that case,

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:44.517
lemme see what I can do.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.087
Special Attack-- Green Star!

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.089
Grow, Fan Grass!

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:52.925
[LUFFY]
Never seen this plant before.

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:55.127
Boaty Banana!

00:09:58.364 --> 00:10:01.901
Ha! A boat! This is
awesome, Usopp!

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:04.870
[USOPP] We can use this
Fan Grass as oars!

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:08.407
[ROBIN] You've got so many
different seeds now. How nice!

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.543
They're pretty handy,
aren't they?

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:13.279
There were a bunch of crazy
plants in the Bowin Islands.

00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:15.681
The deeper I went
into dangerous areas,

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:18.784
the more useful the plants
I found along the way!

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:20.686
I survived there
for two whole years!

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.922
There's no difficulty
I can't overcome.

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.357
Nope, not me!

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.092
[LUFFY]
Hurry up and get onboard!

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.093
Or we'll leave you!

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:30.363
Hey! Just don't forget
who supplied the boat!

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:34.300
[LUFFY] All right, guys!
Let's head thatta way!

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:35.801
I want snowcones!

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.737
Why aren't you rowing?

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.806
Wow! So breezy!

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.375
There's a strong headwind!

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:45.578
Of course. It's the
temperature difference here.

00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:48.714
It creates a change in
air pressure, causing wind!

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.383
Look, the water's boiling!

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:52.385
Y'see? If we'd tried
to swim across,

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:54.220
we'd have been poached pirates!

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:56.055
[LUFFY]
Can't you row any faster?

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:58.457
[USOPP] Why don't you
try helping us, ya bum?

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:03.429
[HYOUTAURUS] You're not
getting away. Come back here!

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:05.331
[USOPP]
Ah, crap!

00:11:05.364 --> 00:11:06.966
[ZORO]
Not that centaur again!

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.200
Hey!

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:11.303
Lemme guess, you changed your
mind and decided to join us?

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.506
Would you quit
recruiting folks, Luffy?

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:15.908
Yeah, it's not like we need
any more strange creatures

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:17.109
joinin' the crew!

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:18.944
[inhales]

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:25.818
[horn blows]

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:27.319
A horn?

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.422
Now, Boss!

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:30.423
[ZORO]
Boss?

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:31.824
That guy on the snail.

00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:34.260
He said somethin'
about a "Boss," too!

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:37.930
[RANDOM MAN 579A]
Please! It's cold. We need Boss!

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:40.332
[HYOUTAURUS]
Finish off the intruders!

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:43.035
They're headed right for you!

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:47.339
Look at the shore
on the other side.

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:48.307
Someone's there.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.542
Where?

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.453
[ZORO]
Guess that's the boss.

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:02.488
[USOPP] The distress signal
was meant for him?

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:05.224
If that's the case, we don't
have anything to worry about.

00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:07.193
This "Boss" guy's got bigger
problems to deal with

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:09.361
than us washing ashore.

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:16.535
[BROWNBEARD] There's a man among
them who's carrying swords.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:20.072
Is he the samurai
who attacked our people?

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:23.843
If so, I'll make him pay.

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:32.151
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
Be good little boys and girls

00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:33.853
and stay out of our way.

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:34.720
[SUBORDINATE 583B]
If you don't,

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:35.654
you might get hurt!

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:37.523
[SUBORDINATE 583C]
It's dangerous, kids!

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:40.593
[SYND] Hey Mr. Robot, did you
come from outside the island?

00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:42.561
Yep, I sure did, buddy.

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:45.064
But let's be clear.
I'm really a cyborg.

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.198
So you have a ship, right?

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:47.666
Do we ever!

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.535
It's called the Sunny.
It's the best!

00:12:49.568 --> 00:12:50.736
[SYND]
Then save us!

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.404
[ALL]
Huh?

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.373
[NAMI]
What does he mean by that?

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:56.242
You have to! Please!

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.511
Whaddya mean?
Take you kids with us?

00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:01.280
This place isn't a
daycare, after all!

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:02.882
[MOCHA]
No, don't leave!

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:05.251
Help us get out
of here! I beg you!

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:06.919
[DOLAN, BIYO]
Please, miss!

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.688
[SANJI]
C'mon! Don't stop!

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:11.624
[SYND] You've got a ship,
you can take us with you!

00:13:11.657 --> 00:13:13.392
[CHILDREN]
Pretty please?

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:15.427
We've gotta go, Nami!

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:26.739
Don't leave us here!

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:28.374
We're not sick anymore!

00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:30.142
We're better. Promise!

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:33.245
What's that? They were sick?

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:48.494
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
Those damn brats!

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.115
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
Those damn brats!

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:15.254
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
All right, now listen up,

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:18.190
children. I know it must've been
exciting to have visitors,

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:20.326
but those people are
very dangerous.

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:22.394
You need to stay
away from them, okay?

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:23.662
Are you sure?

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:26.332
They seemed really nice
and friendly to me.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:27.600
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
I'm afraid they pulled one over

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:28.834
on you, sweetheart.

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:31.337
Hold on. You're sayin'
Mr. Robot's a bad guy?

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:32.171
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
That's right.

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:33.439
Same for the raccoon?

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:34.373
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
Uh-huh.

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:36.508
And the man with the
curly eyebrow, too?

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.244
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
Him, too, but there's no need

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:39.211
to be scared.

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:41.680
So don't worry,
we won't let them hurt you.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.749
We'll keep you all safe.

00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:46.952
We know how sick
you children are. Trust us.

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:50.756
We're going to do everything
in our power to protect you.

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:52.791
We're not going to
hurt them or anything.

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:54.293
We're just going to
put them to sleep

00:14:54.326 --> 00:14:57.062
with our cloud guns, that's all.

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:05.397
[MOCHA]
Please. Wait.

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.568
Please don't go.

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:14.306
I don't wanna be here anymore!

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.809
Take me home!

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:20.713
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
Dammit! They're in the way!

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:22.548
[SYND]
Don't leave us behind!

00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:24.783
We need you to
help us get outta here!

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:27.619
Please, you're our only
hope of getting home!

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:28.787
[SUBORDINATE 583A]
Now, now, children,

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.589
you need to calm down.

00:16:31.857 --> 00:16:35.427
Kids. I'm sorry,
but we've gotta go!

They wanna come!

00:16:49.274 --> 00:16:50.843
I think we should
take 'em with us!

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:52.411
What? Are you crazy?

00:16:52.444 --> 00:16:54.580
We don't even know how
we're gonna save ourselves!

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:56.749
Look, even if we made it
back to the ship,

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:58.684
there's too many of 'em!

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:02.654
This sucks! Somethin'
bad's gonna happen!

Promise me!

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.209
You'll come back later
and rescue us!

I know what's out there.

00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:32.918
I've never been outside of this
building before but I know!

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:35.554
There's nothing else
on this island, is there?

00:17:35.587 --> 00:17:37.256
There are no cities.

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:39.758
No people either!

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:42.528
'Cause nobody came to help us!

I wanna go home and see
my mommy and daddy again!

but you have to come back!

We don't even know
if they need saving!

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:53.966
They told us they're sick.

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:56.368
For all we know,
this could be a hospital!

00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:57.536
We've just met these kids,

00:18:57.569 --> 00:18:59.605
we don't know who they
are or why they're here!

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:02.841
It's not our job to help
everybody we meet!

00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:09.214
[NAMI] I understand that, Sanji.
And I know it's risky.

00:19:12.017 --> 00:19:15.687
But there's no way that I can
turn my back on these children!

Not when we are their
only hope of getting help!

Let's be honest, she's only
sweet to kids, but that's okay.

Okay, Chopper.

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:17.175

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:02.247
Huh?

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:09.921
[BROOK]
What?!

00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:13.158
It's... just a torso?

00:23:17.996 --> 00:23:20.866
[NARRATOR] Nami and Chopper race
through the forboding facility

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:23.101
in an effort to rescue
the imprisoned children,

00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:26.204
And Sanji and Franky are faced
with a difficult confrontation

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:27.272
of their own.

00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:29.541
Meanwhile, having grown
weary of being toyed with

00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:30.976
by the samurai torso,

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:33.378
Brook decides it's
time to retaliate.

00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:35.080
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.113 --> 00:23:36.782
"A Swordplay Showdown!

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:39.785
Brook Vs. the Mysterious
Torso Samurai!"

00:23:39.818 --> 00:23:42.687
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
