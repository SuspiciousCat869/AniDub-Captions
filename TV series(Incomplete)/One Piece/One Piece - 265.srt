1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,737
It's the One Piece
treasure giveaway!

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,540
The first key letter to be
on the lookout for is...

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,277
We'll tell you how to enter
at the end of the show!

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,287
Luffy and his allies have
arrived at Enies Lobby.

5
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,391
If we don't rescue
Franky and Nico Robin

6
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,060
before they pass
through the Main Gate

7
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,529
and into the Gates of
Justice, then that's it.

8
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:29,763
It's over.

9
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:30,697
And why's that?

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,600
It doesn't matter
where they take her to,

11
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,302
we'll just keep on fighting
them until we get Robin back!

12
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,038
I explained all of this before
we left Water 7, remember?

13
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,607
Once we pass that gate,
the only two places

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,177
we can go are Navy Headquarters
or the deep-sea prison.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,411
No matter what happens,

16
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:47,214
we have to settle this before
they reach those rear gates.

17
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,216
Yep. Pretty much.

18
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,283
On top of that,

19
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,653
even if we all rushed the
island at the same time,

20
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:56,724
the only ones capable of going
up against those CP9 guys--

21
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,492
--are you Straw Hats.

22
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,662
After seeing what you can do,
I know how strong you are.

23
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,798
That's why I think you should
stay behind once we get there.

24
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,932
Give us five minutes,

25
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,335
then charge through to the
main island in Rocketman.

26
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,437
The Franky Family and
Galley-La will go in first

27
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,705
and break open the Main Gate

28
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,708
and the Main Island Front Gate
so the train can pass through.

29
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,577
I'm sure we'll suffer
a lot of casualties,

30
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,246
but remember: Once you're in,
keep going no matter what.

31
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,481
Don't look back.

32
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,618
We've only got a
little over 60 people.

33
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,786
The enemy forces
probably have

34
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,622
somewhere between
2 and 3 thousand.

35
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,791
Our best chance for victory
is for you Straw Hats

36
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:35,162
to concentrate on CP9 and leave
the rest of the marines to us.

37
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,631
Right, I got it.

38
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,598
Okay, folks!

39
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,535
We're pulling up to
the front of the island!

40
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,806
While we're here, take a look
at the sky behind Enies Lobby.

41
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:46,640
Behold!

42
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,443
The Gates of Justice.

43
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,779
Whoa!

44
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,714
That's huge!

45
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,252
Go!

46
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,086
Hop to it!

47
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,620
There's no time to lose!

48
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,258
We'll head in first and
clear a path for you,

49
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,659
just like we planned!

50
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,628
Give 'em hell, Straw Hats!

51
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:08,696
Hey!

52
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,763
You two over there!

53
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,665
Aren't you supposed
to be with us?

54
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,301
But Luffy couldn't
wait to rescue Robin.

55
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,237
Wait, where's Luffy?

56
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,937
Huh?

57
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,306
He was here just a second ago.

58
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:27,748
Look!

59
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,649
Isn't that Straw Hat?

60
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,156
What?

61
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,093
Why the hell is he
going in on his own?

62
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,696
That crazy Straw Hat didn't
understand the plan at all!

63
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,766
There goes our strategy.

64
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,701
He said "Right! I
got it", didn't he?

65
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,771
He's really not the
wait-five-minutes type.

66
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,806
Damn. Should have known.

67
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,409
A one-man assault on
Enies Lobby began.

68
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,512
Gum-Gum Rocket!

69
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:02,216
Meanwhile, Spandam was
holding a meeting with CP9.

70
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,283
At last.

71
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:06,553
After five long years,
the time has finally come

72
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:10,491
for all eight members
of CP9 to be reunited.

73
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,260
This should be a
time of celebration.

74
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,630
But instead I'll ask
"What's the meaning of this?"

75
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:21,201
Your orders were to assassinate
the leaders of the revolution!

76
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,670
But according to this article,

77
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,405
not only did you
kill those three,

78
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,106
but twenty others, as well!

79
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,073
What happened?

80
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,176
If you have an excuse,
I'd like to hear it!

81
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,644
Yoyoi!

82
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,346
My most sincere apologies
and pardons, Chief!

83
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,548
Having just returned from a
mission themselves,

84
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,717
the remaining members
of CP9 awaited

85
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,620
Lucci's return in
the Tower of Law.

86
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,457
Stop that, Kumadori!

87
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,493
A real man doesn't
bow his head to anybody!

88
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,729
I'll explain everything that
happened to the Chief,

89
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,631
so shut up and get
a hold of yourself!

90
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,599
Iron Body!

91
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,670
I can't even die right!

92
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,639
Oh just get it over
with, you bastard!

93
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,140
You'd be doing everyone a favor!

94
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,042
I accidentally talked
about it, Chapapa!

95
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,277
Shut up!

96
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,711
Enough.

97
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,146
I understand.

98
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,481
Hot, hot, hot!

99
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,317
I spilt my coffee again, dammit!

100
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,254
Oh, by the way, I heard Nero
didn't work out.

101
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:14,754
Whatever.

102
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,292
Whoa!

103
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,693
What's up with this place?

104
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,395
What a huge hole!

105
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,298
It looks like the island's
floating or something!

106
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,066
I see a town, too!

107
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,234
Huh.

108
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,003
I wonder if Robin's down there.

109
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,276
There's someone
up on the flagpole!

110
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:38,312
Shoot him down
before he gets away!

111
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:38,879
Whoops!

112
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,714
Guess they spotted me!

113
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:48,088
He went inside the main gate!

114
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,424
Luffy passed by one
gate only to find another.

115
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,358
This is the Main Gate!

116
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,459
I have an urgent message

117
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,695
for the Chief Officer at
the Main Island Front Gate!

118
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:55,796
It's an emergency!

119
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,064
This is Spandam.

120
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,298
What's going on?

121
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,267
An intruder somehow managed
to pass through the Main Gate

122
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,303
and is heading towards
the Main Island, sir!

123
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,537
One intruder?

124
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,272
That's what all
this fuss is about?

125
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,408
Surely you can manage
to take care of him.

126
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,075
But, sir!

127
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,343
You don't understand, it's--

128
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,478
This is the Main
Island Front Gate.

129
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,380
Don't worry. We'll
take care of things from here.

130
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,516
However, the marines
weren't prepared

131
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,052
for what they had coming.

132
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:18,786
Hey there, buddy!

133
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,321
That's far enough!

134
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,690
Do you have the slightest
idea where you are?

135
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:23,891
Don't take this guy lightly!

136
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:28,161
Unless my eyes deceive me,
then I'm pretty sure that he's--

137
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,531
The pirate Straw Hat Luffy!

138
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:36,803
What?

139
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,239
What was that you just said?

140
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:41,442
The man with the
100 million berry bounty!

141
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,143
It is him!

142
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,012
Straw Hat Luffy!

143
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,785
Where's Robin?

144
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,371
Tell me where
Robin is right now!

145
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,704
This is the main gate with
another urgent report, sir!

146
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,573
What is it this time?

147
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,712
There's a group of
heavily armed men

148
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,347
riding giant monsters
over the gate!

149
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,352
We need reinforcements!

150
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,122
Please?

151
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,325
Don't waste a second!

152
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,126
Let's go!

153
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,332
Hello?

154
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,566
What's wrong?

155
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,768
Answer me!

156
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,770
What's going on here?

157
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,187
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

158
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,022
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

159
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,119
Having second thoughts now?

160
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,490
It's too late for that.

161
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,620
All right guys,
you ready to roll?

162
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:23,724
Aren't you hurt?

163
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:29,262
Don't worry, these wounds
matter not--to Sniper King!

164
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,101
Only four minutes left!

165
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:38,305
Then the sea train, Rocketman,
is gonna tear through!

166
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:07,500
Sorry to bother you but
could you let me pass?

167
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,537
Even if you ask nicely.

168
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,274
You're still an intruder.

169
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:15,542
And no means no!

170
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,048
Fair enough.

171
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,416
But I'll warn you.

172
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,385
Get ready for a fight.

173
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,019
Bring it on, pirate!

174
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:32,058

00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,035
Hey, that's cheating!

176
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,336
How can we attack him?

177
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,807
It's just a lame childish trick!

178
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,475
Don't back down!

No!

182
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,087
Ally Robot Kick!

183
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,756
I didn't mean to!

184
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,091
I'm sorry!

185
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,493
I've had enough of your games!

186
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,395
Your back is wide open!

187
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,340
Bastard!

188
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:31,652
Bring him down!

189
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,653
There's only one of him!

190
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:57,511
Damn it.

191
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,613
How does he do that?

192
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,482
I'm in a hurry.

193
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:04,718
But you'll have more
people to fight later!

194
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,419
See ya!

195
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,061
Hey!

196
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,463
Come back!

197
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,331
He went inside!

198
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:17,765
After him!

199
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,300
Quick!

200
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,168
He made it to the main island!

201
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,304
Somebody contact the chief!

202
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:23,737
Right!

203
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,439
I'm on it!

204
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,707
This is the front
gate, reporting!

205
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,610
I'm afraid Straw Hat Luffy has
entered the main island, sir!

206
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,444
What?

207
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,613
Why the hell did
you let him do that?

208
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,448
What's going on over there?

209
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,584
What about Oimo and Kashii?

210
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:39,553
You can't tell me
they got taken out, too!

211
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:43,724
Well, it's actually the middle
of the night right now, sir.

212
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:45,726
I'm thinking they're
probably asleep.

213
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,529
Then stop yapping at
me and wake them up!

214
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:51,432
And if any of the other guards
are sleeping, wake them up, too!

215
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:54,201
Yes, yes, sir!

216
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:57,404
I don't get why everyone's
pissing their pants over this.

217
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,140
What's one little intruder?

218
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,677
Just let us take care of 'em.

219
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,744
Nonsense!

220
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:07,248
This place is the entrance
to the World Government.

221
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,483
The Judicial Island
isn't just a Navy base,

222
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,218
it's a symbol of justice!

223
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,455
Any idiot should know what
it means to attack Enies Lobby

224
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:17,191
and if they don't,
we'll have to teach them!

225
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:20,160
If we let some dirty band
of pirates waltz in here

226
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,495
and take their crewmember back,

227
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,631
what does that
say about our forces?

228
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:25,065
We have to beat them!

229
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,734
Our pride is on the line!

230
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:30,704
Those Straw Hats are going
to learn not to take us lightly.

231
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,489
Hey!

232
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:49,623
Gatekeeper!

233
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,459
What's going on
at the main gate?

234
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,695
Can you hear me, or what?

235
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,231
How many enemies are
we looking at here?

236
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,133
Where are they right now?

237
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,368
I need answers, Main Gate!

238
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,503
Did something happen?

239
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:03,304
What's wrong?

240
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:04,538
Hello?

241
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,607
I can't help you if
you don't help me first!

242
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,742
You didn't call me and
then hang up, did you?

243
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,311
Are you listening?

244
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,580
Rope Action!

245
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:15,015
Figure Eight Knot!

246
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:18,318
Bazooka Bat Strike!

247
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,254
Heh heh!

248
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,355
We're just starting!

249
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,157
I can't go wasting my ammo!

250
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,692
Go in through the
doors on the side!

251
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:26,526
Open that gate!

252
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,499
Push 'em back,
before it's too late!

253
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,235
You're in the way!

254
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,769
Mozu, take the left!

255
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,137
You got it!

256
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,273
You're not going anywhere!

257
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,310
Is that a nose hair?

258
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,278
Actually, it's a cowlick!

259
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,516
Get moving!

260
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:49,950
Thanks!

261
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,551
I owe you one!

262
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,760
My Keel Breaker!

263
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,669
Are you done?

264
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:10,170
Mozu?

265
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,772
Kiwi?

266
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,240
We tear ships apart.

267
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:16,776
You can't expect a
little lock to slow us down!

268
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:18,079
All right.

269
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:19,346
My side is done!

270
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,381
Mine too!

271
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:21,615
Good!

272
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,384
Let's open those gates!

273
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:26,086
Herculean Destroyers go!

274
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,536
Don't let them open the gate!

275
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:43,570
Fire!

276
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:44,505
Shut up!

277
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:45,705
Move it!

278
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,056
All right men, let's go!

279
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:10,230
We made it through
the main gate!

280
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,468
Whoa!

281
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,604
What is that big hole?

282
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,639
We don't have time
for that right now!

283
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:20,641
Just ignore it!

284
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:23,310
Everyone make a
dash for the next gate!

285
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:25,712
It's a waterfall!

286
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,784
We did it!

287
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,253
Guys over here!

288
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:33,554
I got a plan.

289
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,422
Could you lend me a hand?

290
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:43,430
Kashii!

291
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:44,331
Oimo!

292
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,266
You have to get up!

293
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,767
We need your help!

294
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,403
The main gate was
forced open by intruders!

295
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,044
Hey Oimo, you hear that?

296
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,679
He said the main gate's open.

297
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:00,314
Oi!

298
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:02,349
I'm afraid that won't do.

299
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,417
Right, Kashii?

300
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:10,224
And I was sleeping so well, too.

301
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,125
Work is work.

302
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:12,492
Let's go.

303
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,329
Up and at 'em!

304
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,320
These pipsqueaks
don't look like much.

305
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:40,221
C'mon.

306
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:42,323
You wanna get back
to bed soon, right?

307
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:44,058
Let's make this quick.

308
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:45,259
Sounds good.

309
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,728
Whoa, they, they're giants!

310
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:49,096
Listen, twerps.

311
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,065
I dunno what you
think you're doing here

312
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:52,533
and I don't really care.

313
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,469
Point is, you're getting
crushed if you get in our way.

314
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,704
Right, Oimo?

315
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:57,605
Oi.

316
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:58,172
Right.

317
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:00,274
You tell 'em, Kashii.

318
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,577
One more step and we'll
pound your bones into paste.

319
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,745
Dude, this isn't fair!

320
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:08,215
Nobody told me these guys
had giants for gatekeepers!

321
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,316
They're huge!

322
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:13,754
They make our Herculean
Destroyers look like runts!

323
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:14,621
Now, go home!

324
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,424
There's no way
I'm letting you through!

325
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,460
Me neither!

326
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:20,661
Here they come!

327
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:23,297
The Franky Family ain't gonna
back down no matter what!

328
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,065
Ain't that right, you guys?

329
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:26,566
Do it for Bro!

330
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:34,675
All right, you know
what that means.

331
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,210
You bet.

332
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:38,745
Let's do this!

333
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,118
Those giants may be
a lot bigger than us

334
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:46,453
but we're still pretty big!

335
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:49,189
We've torn apart ships
ten times their size!

336
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,558
These freaks are nothing!

337
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,426
Go Destroyers!

338
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:17,785
No!

339
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,486
Our Herculean Destroyers!

340
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,123
They-- They got pounded!

341
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:24,324
Don't you know?

342
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,794
We have the blood of warriors
running through our veins!

343
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:29,263
An overgrown human
is still a human,

344
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:32,399
but a giant of any size
is a fighter at heart!

345
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:36,203
By the pride of my people,
I won't let you pass!

346
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:36,770
Oi!

347
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,305
Me too!

348
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,180
Don't uh-- Don't get
cold feet, everyone!

349
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:48,215
We can still do this!

350
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,184
That's right, our
Big Bro is waiting for us

351
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:52,319
on the other side of that gate!

352
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,759
We'll show those monsters a
fight worthy of bro's name!

353
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,794
Right, Franky Family?

354
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,774
Two minutes to go.

355
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,508
Gero!

356
00:21:34,261 --> 00:21:36,196
Hey, Straw Hat Luffy.

357
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:38,765
How many friends did
you bring with you, huh?

358
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:44,572
We've got 10,000 soldiers
here at Enies Lobby!

359
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:47,541
Sorry, but it's just me.

360
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,181
Now get out of my way!

361
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:23,704
I won't even let a single
ant pass through this gate!

362
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,273
Good thing we aren't ants!

363
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:32,546
"On the next One Piece,
Battle Against Giants!

364
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,248
