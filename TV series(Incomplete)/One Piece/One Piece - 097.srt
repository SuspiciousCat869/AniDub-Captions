I've searched the ship's
stores from top to bottom,

151
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,042
and there just isn't enough
spare lumber on board

152
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,211
for us to repair the main mast.

153
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,912
And without a main mast,

be going anywhere.

I'll be glad to dash
over and get it!

177
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,923
[BARBAROSSA]
Hmm... Bad idea.

178
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,091
The sands have changed lately.

179
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,093
It's too dangerous
for outsiders.

180
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,095
[LUFFY] I caused this.
I'll take care of it!

181
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,298
[BARBAROSSA laughs]

182
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,067
All right! You're on!

183
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,404
You can use this sand sled
to bring back the lumber.

184
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,240
[NAMI] It looks more like
a canoe than a sled to me.

185
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,009
Zaba and Rasa will
show you the oasis.

186
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,744
They'll be your guides.

187
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:39,946
Huh?

188
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,915
[BARBAROSSA] Rasa is the best
sand‐sledder on the ship.

189
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,318
These sleds carry two.
Who'll you take?

190
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,787
Hey, don't worry,
I'll be fine alone!

191
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,121
[USOPP]
Oh, come on now!

192
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,457
This is no time to get cocky!

193
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,759
[SANJI] It looks like
it might be tough going.

194
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,428
You want me to come along?

195
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,164
[screams]

196
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,337
[ALL]
Huh?

197
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,179
[BARBAROSSA]
Very impressive, Rasa.

198
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,384
[RASA] These others,
they seem like outlanders,

199
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,952
but you're from here.

200
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,021
Whoa. How could she tell?

201
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,956
[RASA] I'll wager you've
had some experience

202
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,825
with a sand sled.

203
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,827
Which means you'll
come along with us.

204
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,162
No way! It's much too
dangerous for Vivi to go!

205
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,498
Yeah! She stays!

206
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,735
All right. I'll be glad to go.

207
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,238
[LUFFY]
Huh, so these travel on sand?

208
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,339
How does it work?

209
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,809
[VIVI] I'll pilot the sled.
I did it once long ago.

210
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,544
[LUFFY] It's not too
different from a ship.

211
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,247
This goes here, right?

212
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,352
[LUFFY screams]

213
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,054
[BARBAROSSA]
Huh?

214
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,195
Okay, I'm back!

215
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,432
[SANJI, USOPP, NAMI] Will you
let Vivi handle the sled

216
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,035
from now on?

217
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,404
You take it easy there,
Luffy, all right?

218
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,206
Now, let's see...

219
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,908
[VIVI screams]

220
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,377
Zaba! Let's go!

221
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,280
Ready, Rasa!

222
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,550
Yahoo‐ee! Ha!

223
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,785
This is loads of fun!

224
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,221
We should borrow one of these;
we'd get to Yuba real fast!

225
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,224
[VIVI] I don't know.
Sand sleds are hard to control.

226
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,427
Believe me, they're
not easily mastered!

227
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,896
Then how is it you got
so good at it so quick?

228
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:37,930
I used to have one.

229
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,266
I got it way back when
I was just a little girl!

230
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,401
I'd ride it all the time.

231
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,569
Oh.

232
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,937
[CHOPPER]
But what are we supposed to do

233
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,939
while we're waiting for them?

234
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,541
We can always eat the camel.

235
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,242
[SAND PIRATES]
Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!

236
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,044
[SANJI, USOPP]
Second!

237
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,146
I'm just kidding!

238
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,082
[SAND PIRATES]
Aww...

239
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,884
Didn't sound like you
were kidding to me.

240
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,991
[LUFFY, VIVI scream]

241
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,929
[LUFFY]
You guys! What's the big idea?

242
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,332
Hey, Rasa! What are you doing?

243
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,001
[BOTH yelling]

244
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,403
[LUFFY]
Hey, Vivi!

245
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,338
We're getting pulled
even farther in!

246
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,573
[VIVI]
It's quicksand!

247
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,976
If we get pulled in all the way,
we'll never get back out!

248
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,447
Rasa, wasn't that going too far?

249
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,448
[RASA]
If she's lucky,

250
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,150
that spoiled little
princess will be fine.

251
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,954
Huh? It sounds as if
you know that girl!

252
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,923
Yeah. I'll never forget her.

253
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,682
[LUFFY]
Can you bring her around, Vivi?

254
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,385
I can't! It looks like
we're done for!

255
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,989
[VIVI]
This is it, Luffy!

256
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,158
No! Watch out!

257
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,960
Gum‐Gum...

258
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,667
[NAMI]
Despite how he seems,

259
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,303
you can always count
on Luffy in a pinch.

260
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:29,008
Well, I'm more concerned about
the fickleness of the desert.

261
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,676
The fickleness of the desert?

262
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,178
Yeah.

263
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,181
The desert can shift
moods in an instant.

264
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,515
A slight change in the weather

265
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,085
or people's hearts
will affect it greatly.

266
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,155
A change in people's hearts?

267
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,991
Huh? What's that?

268
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,025
Captain, it's them!
They've found us!

269
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,460
Off the starboard side!

270
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,262
Battle stations, everyone!

271
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,564
[SAND PIRATES shouting]

272
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,441
Do you wanna get
in my way, too, pal?

273
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,488
There must be hundreds!

274
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,322
Who are they?

275
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,424
[BARBAROSSA]
They're desert bandits!

276
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:56,428
A desperate band of vermin
who are always attacking us!

277
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,764
Conflict seems to be
in the air today.

278
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,300
Everyone in the desert
seems to be on edge.

279
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,168
[laughing]

280
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,503
Now that you can't run away,

281
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,072
we've finally got you
where we want you!

282
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,173
Hear me, men!

283
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,443
Don't let a single one of
these desert rats escape!

284
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,279
[SAND PIRATES]
Yeah!

285
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,813
Go pirates!

286
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,783
Go pirates!

287
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,752
Yes, hooray. Go pirates.

288
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,521
[BARBAROSSA] The desert has
pitted us against each other!

289
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,790
Now we will see who
the desert will favor.

290
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,159
At last, we will end this.

291
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,795
Let the desert decide
who will be victorious!

292
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,263
[laughs]

293
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,098
Fool! Fool!

294
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,268
The desert will never
choose one such as you!

295
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,140
[USOPP]
Hm?

296
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:41,974
What's that?

297
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,475
[SAND PIRATE H]
Grand Dung Beetle!

298
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,811
[SAND PIRATE I]
It's a Grand Dung Beetle!

299
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,680
What's a Grand Dung Beetle?

300
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,181
Beats the hell outta me.

301
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,482
[BARBAROSSA]
They're desert bugs that haul

302
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,351
enormous balls of dung.

303
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,486
Over a hundred people
a year are squished

304
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,488
by their rolling
balls of manure.

305
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,057
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

306
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,797
[BANDIT LEADER laughs]

307
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,901
Captain!

308
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,304
That huge ball of excrement
is headed right for us!

309
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,840
[growls]

310
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,876
[BARBAROSSA]
Leave it to me!

311
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,212
[yells]

312
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,557
[ALL scream]

313
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,826
[SAND PIRATES yelling]

314
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,494
[ZORO]
I'll take this!

315
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,176
Thank you, my friends.

316
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,512
[laughs]

317
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,748
[BANDIT LEADER] We'll let
you off easy this time!

318
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,251
Your lives are spared for now!

319
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,921
What a screwball.

320
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,695
[ZABA] Rasa! If that was
a joke, it wasn't funny!

321
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:10,763
They're not following!

322
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,865
[RASA]
Fine by me!

323
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,733
I'm not gonna wait
around for her.

324
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,404
If she can't keep up, it's not
our job to look for her!

325
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,494
Hope you weren't waiting long!

326
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,596
[laughing]

327
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,607
[LUFFY] This whole oasis
is covered in sand.

328
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,977
[VIVI] Once it was a
flourishing city, but now...

329
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,946
[LUFFY]
Have you been here before?

330
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,181
[VIVI]
Yes.

331
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,684
The people of this city gave me
a small sand sled as a memento.

332
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:12,791
[VIVI] It was a very long
time ago, though.

333
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,828
I stopped here once with
my father when I was little,

334
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,664
when he was traveling
around the country.

335
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,102
[RASA] And I've been
waiting all this time.

336
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,174
Back then, the king made
this town a promise.

337
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,143
"If anything should
happen to this oasis,

338
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,612
I will come rushing to help.

339
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:37,549
The kingdom won't ignore any
voice, no matter how small."

340
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,987
[VIVI]
Then, you were that girl!

341
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,492
[RASA] Eventually, this
oasis was buried in sand

342
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,494
and abandoned.

343
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:52,998
Every last person in
town left... but not me.

344
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,200
I stayed behind and
waited for you.

345
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,569
I believed in you.

346
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,039
But... the king never came.

347
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,709
And neither did you.

348
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,011
But that's‐‐ The same
thing was happening

349
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,646
to towns and cities
all over the country,

350
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,047
and the king was busy every day

351
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,916
trying to deal with
a nation‐wide crisis!

352
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,185
I don't wanna
hear your excuses!

353
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,921
For years, I waited for you all
alone in an abandoned city

354
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,223
in the middle of
a trackless desert!

355
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,096
Finally, I couldn't even
tell the difference

356
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,933
between dawn and dusk.

357
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,905
By the time Barbarossa took me
in, I couldn't feel anything.

358
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,541
Not the scorching heat
of the midday sun,

359
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,077
or the freezing cold of night.

360
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:42,114
The fact that I was
still alive baffled me.

361
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:47,052
But the king's promise continued
to ring inside my head.

362
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,924
[RASA] To this day,
I don't understand it.

363
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,092
Life was so difficult,
and I was all by myself,

364
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,728
so what exactly
was I waiting for?

365
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,566
Just what was it that kept me
going for all those hard years?

366
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,935
Was it hatred? Anger?

367
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:06,104
Was I too stubborn or
stupid to give up hope?

368
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,575
Why did I stay here?

369
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,743
Somebody tell me!

370
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,560
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,732
I'm so sorry I made you wait.

372
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,921
[BARBAROSSA]
They sure ran off in a hurry.

373
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,856
It's really too bad.

374
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,857
It would've been nice

375
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,827
to steal all of their
food and water first.

376
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,162
[NAMI] I guess sand pirates
have it rough too.

377
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,964
[BARBAROSSA] Every living
thing in this desert

378
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,833
has it the same way.

379
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,001
You know, long ago,

380
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,037
I used to feel that the desert
belonged to everybody,

381
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,006
but when I think
about it nowadays,

382
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:17,643
I've begun to think that that
was somewhat conceited.

383
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:18,877
When I look at the desert now,

384
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,781
I wonder if perhaps it doesn't
really belong to anybody at all.

385
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,684
That's why we can
live here freely.

386
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:29,788
It belongs to no one,
and so is free itself.

387
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,156
Like the ocean?

388
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,025
[BARBAROSSA]
That's a good question.

389
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,226
I suspect that's something

390
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,995
you'll have to find
out yourselves.

391
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:42,034
There it is! We're here!

392
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,214
[ACE]
Luffy!

393
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,717
Where are you?

394
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,829
<i>♪Remember when we</i>
<i>were kids we longed for</i>

395
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:16,101
<i>adventures greater than</i>
<i>anything we had ever dreamed!</i>

396
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,236
<i>Let's set sail,</i>
<i>it's not too late!</i>

397
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,273
<i>As I scoop up the sand,</i>

398
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,376
<i>watch it fall between my hands,</i>

399
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,846
<i>The sand, it flows like time...</i>

400
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,949
<i>I can hear it calling!</i>

401
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,219
<i>There's no other way...</i>
<i>the time is now!</i>

402
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,923

403
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:43,929

404
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:50,135
<i>At breakneck speed, I know</i>

405
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,105
<i>If we do not give up,</i>

406
00:22:53,138 --> 00:23:00,779
<i>Someday we'll wash up on that</i>

407
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,949

408
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,398
[NAMI] Hey, Luffy!
Where's your brother?

409
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,599
[LUFFY]
Beats me!

410
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:21,767
[SANJI] You mean he's worse
at directions than this guy?

411
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,469
[ZORO] Shut up! Don't you
have cooking to do, pervert?

412
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,405
[SANJI]
If the shoe fits, blade boy.

413
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,340
[ACE]
Hey! I got food and water!

414
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,075
[USOPP]
You do? How?

415
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,843
[ACE]
Got it from the rebel army!

416
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,978
[VIVI]
What did you say?

417
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,813
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

418
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:38,350
"False Fortitude! Camu,
Rebel Soldier at Heart!"

419
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,119
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
