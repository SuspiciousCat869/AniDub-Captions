1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,105
You can say what you want.

2
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,374
If you wanna die,
or whatever, that's fine.

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:11,478
But when you say it,
you say it as part of our crew.

4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:16,049
From now on,
leave everything to us!

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,322
Those fools braved
Aqua Laguna to get here.

6
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,223
They're determined,
if nothing else.

7
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,793
Humph. Either that,
or they're just lucky.

8
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,529
Remember, we have
permission to kill this time.

9
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:32,533
But if we kill them, it'll be
over before we have any fun.

10
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:33,500
The drawbridge?

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,236
Yeah. The Franky Family's trying

12
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,238
to get that under
control right now.

13
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,439
Once they bring it down,

14
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:41,609
we should be able to get to
the other side, no problem.

15
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:42,610
What a pain.

16
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:46,546
She's right there and
all we can do is wait.

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,423
Damn it.

18
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:00,560
What is her deal? She must be
hiding one hell of a secret.

19
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,232
Hey! CP9! Here are your orders!

20
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,266
Kill the intruders,

21
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,269
but only engage them
here at the Tower of Law!

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,241
My life and my promotion are the
most important things right now.

23
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,076
I have to be careful about this.

24
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,745
If I let all my
underlings run off,

25
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:21,114
who's gonna protect me
if something goes wrong?

26
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,319
Stupid pirates!

27
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,453
You may act tough,

28
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:29,423
but you don't know what
you're getting yourselves into!

29
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,191
Open your eyes!

30
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,192
Come on!

31
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:36,163
You don't think you can
beat all of CP9, do you?

32
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,198
And what about
the Gates of Justice?

33
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,035
You don't think you
can open them, do you?

34
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:44,772
Even then. If things
go wrong, I have this!

35
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:47,074
The Golden Transponder Snail,

36
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,578
giving me the authority
to issue a Buster Call!

37
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,112
A Buster Call?

38
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,648
Yes. That's right.

39
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,718
I'm sure you
remember its power well.

40
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:02,556
After all, it did destroy your
homeland 20 years ago.

41
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,558
What was it, "Ohara?"

42
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:08,295
Hard to recall the name
since it was wiped off the map!

43
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,531
Robin's homeland?

44
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,100
He's pissing me off.

45
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,235
There's no place left.

46
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,370
Nowhere for me
to go or return to.

47
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,808
Anything but that!
I'm begging you!

48
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:25,579
Ooh. Begging for mercy,
I like that!

49
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:26,647
What's wrong?

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,881
You don't want me to press this

51
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:31,285
and annihilate all your little
friends with a Buster Call?

52
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,220
Is that what you're saying?

53
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,756
You're insane.

54
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,260
If you push that button, do you
have any clue what will happen?

55
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,095
Of course I do!

56
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,230
This button will eliminate
any chance your friends

57
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,200
possibly have of
leaving this island alive!

58
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,168
All it takes is
one little press.

59
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,670
It couldn't be more simple!

60
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,806
If you think that, you
don't understand a thing!

61
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,775
Are all those old memories
coming back to you now?

62
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,411
Let's see.

63
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,114
Maybe I should
press it after all.

64
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,549
It might be fun.

65
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,588
This isn't a joke! Stop it!

66
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,628
I'm the one who makes
the demands here, wench.

67
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,581
You say Ohara was
wiped off the map,

68
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,182
but your map doesn't show you

69
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,585
the lives of the
people who lived there!

70
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:40,387
Your view of the
world is so distant

71
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,492
and so twisted that you've
lost sight of your humanity!

72
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,704
There's a limit to how
much you can sacrifice

73
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,139
in the name of justice.

74
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,609
A Buster Call is going too far.

75
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,612
You can't use it.

76
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,546
Anything but that.

77
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,740
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

78
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,247
All right, get her!

79
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,249
Nice throw! Wow!

80
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,221
Yeah! Bullseye!

81
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,123
Take that, monster girl!

82
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,324
Gross! You're so creepy!

83
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:37,063
Monster! Monster!
Monster! Monster!

84
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,770
The monster girl hit me!

85
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,207
She's scary!

86
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,209
You'll be sorry!

87
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,104
Hey, you!

88
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,111
My kids came home crying because
you hit them on the head!

89
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,080
What are you thinking,
acting like that?

90
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,248
You stay away from
them, you hear me?

91
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:34,087
Don't you have anything
to say for yourself?

92
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,357
You really are a little
monster, aren't you?

93
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,694
Hey! You come back here!

94
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:43,330
I'm not done talking
with you yet!

95
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:53,240
Mommy, mommy, what're we
having for dinner tonight?

96
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,742
Well, what would you like?

97
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:58,511
Um-- um--Rice omelet!

98
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,448
You sure like rice omelets, huh?

99
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,549
Yep!

100
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,219
Then we'll pick up some
eggs on the way home, okay?

101
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:06,653
Okay!

102
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,697
Sorry I'm home so late.

103
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,601
Hello, is anyone there?
Aunt Roji?

104
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,148
"To Robin. Today--

105
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,784
--as you must know, is
my little girl's birthday.

106
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:37,918
So the family is going out

107
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:41,689
for a special dinner tonight,
just the three of us.

108
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,624
We left some bread
out on the table,

109
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,726
so you can eat that for dinner.

110
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,530
Don't be too
greedy with the jam.

111
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:53,133
When you're done eating,
and before we come back,

112
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,170
I want you to do the dishes,
scrub the floors,

113
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,173
take the laundry inside,
and go straight to bed

114
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,608
as soon as you're
finished with your chores.

115
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,718
Mommy, mommy, what're
we having for dinner tonight?

116
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,120
Well, what would you like?

117
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:17,190
Um-- um--Rice omelet!

118
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,627
You sure like rice omelets, huh?

119
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,728
Yep!

120
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,663
Then we'll pick up some eggs
on the way home, okay?

121
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,031
Okay!

122
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,453
Oh! Look! Here comes Robin!

123
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,290
Seems she's stopping
by to return a book.

124
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,625
Everyone get in place, quick!

125
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,265
Hello? Professor Clover?

126
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,400
I finished the book you lent me.

127
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:09,376
One-- two--
Congratulations, Robin!

128
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,513
You're amazing, Robin!
A real genius!

129
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,549
We've got a cake
for you, by the way!

130
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,619
Robin. That doctoral exam
you took the other day,

131
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,688
you passed with a perfect score!

132
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:24,658
From this day forward, you
are an official archaeologist!

133
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,527
And since you're one of us now,

134
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,497
we can all work on our research
together, starting today!

135
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:33,801
Here, this proves
that you're a scholar.

136
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,070
Wear it with pride!

137
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,371
It looks great on you, Robin!

138
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,372
We're so proud!

139
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,677
Now listen up, you must
understand what it means

140
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,813
to be an Ohara archeologist.

141
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:46,814
Right!

142
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,549
I'm ready to learn!

143
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:52,586
Our knowledge, in particular,
comes from the past.

144
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,756
And this library, known
as the Tree of Knowledge,

145
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:59,593
has stood for over 5,000 years,
collecting countless documents

146
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,529
and literature from
every corner of the world.

147
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:05,232
This is a treasure for
all humanity to share

148
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,735
and nourish for
future generations.

149
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:12,273
As the world's largest library,
knowledge is our pride and joy.

150
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:14,174
Under the branches of this tree,

151
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,745
the finest archeologists from
every sea have gathered!

152
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,714
With this vast wealth of
information at our disposal,

153
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:24,284
there is no historical
mystery that cannot be solved!

154
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,154
Are you ready to join us?

155
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,656
Yes sir!

156
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:32,259
In that case, I look forward to
seeing your research take form,

157
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,694
and watching all
the contributions

158
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,562
you will make to the world.

159
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,831
Professor, what I'd
really like is to find out

160
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,500
what happened in
the "Blank Century"!

161
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,136
No! You can't!

162
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:45,139
I strictly forbid it,
just as I always have!

163
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,574
Huh? I don't get it.

164
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:48,609
If we want to solve the
mysteries of the world,

165
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,444
shouldn't we study
the Poneglyphs

166
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,412
to find out what
happened back then?

167
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:53,480
What?

168
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,516
How do you know about all that?

169
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,786
Did you use your powers to
peek on us in the basement?

170
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,321
I just--

171
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:02,489
Any attempt to decipher
or study the Poneglyphs

172
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:05,759
is considered a criminal act
by the World Government!

173
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,096
I see.

174
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,231
So that's why you
don't tell anybody.

175
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,034
That's why you study them
in the basement at night.

176
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,504
You were spying on us!

177
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,306
So how much do you know?

178
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,476
This is a very serious matter
we're dealing with here!

179
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,278
Explain yourself, Robin!

180
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:29,650
I know it's bad, but
even if I asked nicely,

181
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,718
you still wouldn't
let me join you!

182
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,590
That's why I studied so hard
to become an archeologist

183
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,725
because I thought then you would

184
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,361
finally treat me
like everyone else.

185
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,796
I just wanted to learn.

186
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:47,200
Robin.

187
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:49,603
I know this is hard.

188
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,739
You've studied with all
your heart and deserve

189
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,142
to be called a scholar as
much as anyone else here.

190
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:58,212
However, you're
also still a child.

191
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,548
If word gets out, then every
one of us could be put to death.

192
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,183
Harsh as that sounds,

193
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,052
it's something we're
willing to accept.

194
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,155
Since this became the law
of the world 800 years ago,

195
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,424
countless scholars
have lost their lives,

196
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,560
as many as there
are stars in the sky!

197
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,764
But we can't stop now,
and I'll tell you why.

198
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,232
Of all the scholars
who ever tried

199
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,733
to decipher the ancient texts,

200
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:23,403
we of Ohara are the only ones
who have met with any success.

201
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,741
For us, there is
no turning back.

202
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,343
I swear on the
Tree of Knowledge,

203
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:32,079
if you ever come close
to the basement again,

204
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,280
you will be forbidden

205
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,350
from entering the library or
conducting research with us!

206
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,118
You understand?

207
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:43,490
Robin!

208
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,726
I hate to say this,
especially now,

209
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,428
but she's just like her mom.

210
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:48,596
It's only a matter of time

211
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:51,432
before she uncovers
that secret, too.

212
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:53,500
Her mother Olvia was only

213
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,303
captured by Marines
a few days ago.

214
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,472
But it's already clear
what fate she'll suffer.

215
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,441
Wa-- water.

216
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,479
Wawater?

217
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:23,056
Perfect!

218
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,468
Guess I'm still alive after all.

219
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:38,505
I just wonder
if she's okay, too.

220
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:42,610
Anyhow, thank you for
your help, but I gotta ask--

221
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:46,647
is there a town or village
somewhere 'round here?

222
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,182
Mmhm.

223
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,450
That's a shame.

224
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,587
I 'spose beggars
can't be choosers,

225
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,790
but a deserted island
woulda been nice, y'know?

226
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:07,668
You can stare all you want,
but ain't nothing gonna happen.

227
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:11,405
As you can see, I hurt
my leg, so I'm stayin' put.

228
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,641
'Least for the time bein'.

229
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:14,775
After I feel a little better,

230
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:18,178
I'll build a raft or somethin'
to get me outta here.

231
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,483
This your first time
seeing a giant, Missy?

232
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:23,817
Yeah.

233
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,519
I'll tell you one thing,

234
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:29,690
I may be big as those guys from
Elbaf, but I sure ain't as mean.

235
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,659
Just as sure as
there's war-like giants,

236
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,727
there's peaceful ones, too.

237
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,629
Huh.

238
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,733
I know this is a long shot,
but I gotta ask anyway.

239
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,570
When you get home, you
think maybe you could--uh--

240
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:45,472
not tell anyone that a giant
washed up on the beach?

241
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,274
Okay, sure.

242
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,410
Well, that was too easy.

243
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,445
Of course you're
gonna tell people.

244
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,713
I said I wouldn't.

245
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,086
Yeah, you're tellin' a fib.

246
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:03,190
Ain't no way a kid can
keep a secret this big!

247
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,625
Don't worry about it.

248
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:07,093
I'm not really
interested in you.

249
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,768
Dereshishishi. Dereshishishi.

250
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:19,639
Dereshishishi. Dereshishishi.
Dereshishishi. Dereshishishi.

251
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:26,814
"Dereshi"? What does that mean?

252
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,315
It don't mean a darn thing!

253
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,483
I'm just laughing!

254
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,421
That's the way you laugh?

255
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:37,190
You sure are a
funny little girl!

256
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,097
You're the funny one!

257
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,467
I gotta admit,

258
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:50,738
all my life people been
tellin' me my laugh is silly.

259
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:54,275
But you, you're pretty
cute when you laugh!

260
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:58,712
You should do it more
often, I say! Dereshishishi.

261
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,248
Anyhow, I go by
the name of Saul.

262
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:05,185
Jaguar D. Saul, if you like.

263
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,287
"D"?

264
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,455
Yeah.

265
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:10,090
I don't much know what it
means but from what I hear,

266
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:13,093
everyone in my family has
it for their middle name.

267
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,062
Anyways, what about you?

268
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,196
My name's Robin.

269
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,464
I see.

270
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:21,435
Well, truth is, Robin, some guys
are chasing me down right now.

271
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,605
So, uh, if someone
finds me, I'm in trouble.

272
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,640
I said I wouldn't tell!

273
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,053
Good!

274
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:40,520
Here's another one.

275
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:47,161
Mighty kind of you, Robin, but
you go ahead and take this one.

276
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:50,064
My stomach's pretty full as-is.

277
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:53,567
As you can see, I caught
a real whopper last night.

278
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:59,039
Well, I better get back
to work on that raft.

279
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,675
Should be done
pretty soon at this rate.

280
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,515
I don't mean to pry,

281
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:10,551
but it seems like you have an
awful lot of time on your hands.

282
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,386
Not that I don't
like your company,

283
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,655
but you've been sticking
with me for days now.

284
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:18,058
Ain't your parents and
friends gonna get suspicious?

285
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,561
I don't have any parents.

286
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:21,762
Actually, I do have a mom,

287
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:24,632
but she set sail for work
years ago and never came back.

288
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,499
I don't even remember her face.

289
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,603
I'm sort-of-friends with the
archaeologists around here,

290
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,739
but they won't let me
join in on their research,

291
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:33,707
so I don't know anymore.

292
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,542
The other kids say I'm creepy,

293
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,544
so even if I wanted
to play with them,

294
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:41,515
I don't think
that they'd let me.

295
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:45,051
Ah, so you have
Devil Fruit powers, huh?

296
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:46,753
You aren't scared of me?

297
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:50,157
I used to sail all over the
Grand Line back in the day.

298
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,094
I've seen plenty of folks with
powers tons scarier than yours.

299
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:57,364
To be honest, I'm kinda jealous
of your little arm thing.

300
00:19:57,397 --> 00:20:05,472
It looks pretty handy!
Dereshishishi. Dereshishishi.

301
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,609
That laugh of
yours is really weird!

302
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,110
Dereshishishi.

303
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:12,246
It don't matter if
your laugh's weird,

304
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,682
all that really matters,
is when you laugh,

305
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,451
all of a sudden,
your problems disappear!

306
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:18,385
Why?

307
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,820
What d'you mean "why?"

308
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:23,123
Everyone knows you laugh
when you're having fun, right?

309
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:25,726
So if you're not having fun,
all you need to do is laugh

310
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,195
and everything'll
work out just fine!

311
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,530
You're just a kid,

312
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,632
but it seems like you're
having a tough time.

313
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,567
When you're feelin'
down, just laugh.

314
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,203
There ain't nothin'
a good laugh can't fix.

315
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,073
It seems awfully silly
to laugh when you're sad.

316
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,774
Don't knock it tell you try it!

317
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:43,711
Here. "Dereshishi!"

318
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:47,547
Do it just like that and I bet
you'll feel better in a flash!

319
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:52,620
Deresh!

320
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:56,657
Not bad! Now, with more gusto!

321
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,659
Dereshishishishi!

322
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,199
Dereshishishi!

323
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,434
Now that's more like it!

324
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:13,674
This is Navy Headquarters here.

325
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:16,343
Once again, we're hoping we
could speak to Chief Spandine.

326
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,245
You heard 'em, Chief. What now?

327
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,179
Ignore them.

328
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:21,649
They probably just
want a status report.

329
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:23,584
We'll contact them
when we see the shore.

330
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,452
That's good enough.

331
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:28,255
Ohara, Opera,
O-whatever, who cares?

332
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,489
Why are they wasting my time,

333
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:32,426
making me trek all the way out
here to the West Blue, huh?

334
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:36,563
Let's get this over with, then
get the hell outta this dump.

335
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:17,831
So wait, you said you don't
even remember your mom's face?

336
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:19,733
No, but I'd like to see her.

337
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,536
And is she an archaeologist
by any chance?

338
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,738
Yep. She's traveling in
search of the history

339
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,073
no one knows about.

340
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:27,141
Wa-wait a second.

341
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:28,809
What did you say
her name was again?

342
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:30,811
On the next One Piece:

343
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:34,314
"Fated Mother and Daughter!
The Mother's Name Is Olvia!"

344
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:37,017
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
