00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.290
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.330
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.130
Smiling, even as he stood
upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.300
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.600
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.600
You can have it!

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.500
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.710
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.540
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.210
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:32.603 --> 00:02:34.939
[NARRATOR] After a deadly
struggle on Fishman Island,

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.709
the Straw Hats have finally
arrived in the New World,

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.409
where they immediately
come face-to-face with

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.979
the treacherous
weather conditions

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:42.409
of the Maubeugemour Sea.

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.249
[CHOPPER]
What's with this weather?

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.919
[NAMI] Maubeugemour Sea
always has bad weather!

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.549
"Meat galore"?

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:49.989
No, "Maubeugemour"!

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.089
Also called
"The Ill-Tempered Sea"!

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:54.159
This place has every
kind of terrible weather

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.489
you can think of, and even a few
you'd never know existed at all!

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:58.429
Chopper...

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:59.659
[NARRATOR]
There, they met Lily,

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.499
a young Giant girl who
ate the Mini-Mini Fruit,

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.399
and agreed to help
save her father,

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:06.899
the legendary chef
known as Panz Fry,

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:07.999
from the Navy.

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:09.739
But I have to save Dad!

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.809
And I'll do whatever it takes!

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:13.579
If they take him to Impel Down,

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.509
I'll probably never
see him again!

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:19.949
Catching that Navy ship
is my only chance!

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:20.919
[LUFFY]
Lily.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:22.849
I wanna help save your dad!

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.359
If he's the only one
who can cook like that,

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.789
then we have to get him out
so I can try it, right?

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.529
[NARRATOR] However, a mysterious
group called the Neo Navy

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:34.929
hopes to catch the
giant and kill him.

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:43.639
There's my dad!

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.439
[SHUZO laughs]

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.279
Just consider this our
way of saying hello.

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:50.009
Bring us up! Quickly!

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:51.109
Let's finish them.

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.119
[NEO MARINES]
Sir!

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.049
[NARRATOR]
With the Straw Hats, the Navy,

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.519
and the Neo Navy all intent
on apprehending

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.559
Panz Fry, all three parties
were soon locked

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.229
in a vicious battle.

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.299
Uh-oh, here it comes!

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.169
Gum-Gum... Balloon!

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.129
[SHUZO]
Move aside!

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.539
--It's a dude?

[LUFFY yells]

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:27.649
[MOMONGA]
This is a Navy ship.

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:29.749
I won't let you do
as you please!

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.989
I will try that volcano cooking!

00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:39.259
No matter what!

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.529

"Z's Ambition!

[PANZ]
Huh?

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.729
[MARINES yelling]

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.299
Storm the ship!

[NEO MARINES yelling]

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:17.699
Not today!

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.899
[MARINES yelling]

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.939
Kill every pirate you see!

[SHUZO laughing]

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:38.289
So you've got a bounty.

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.259
Are you a pirate as well?

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:41.259
Yeah.

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:42.759
[SHUZO]
Well, in that case...

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.559
I'll send you both to hell!

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:46.829
Leave this guy to me.

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:48.829
[SHUZO grunts]

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:50.899
Now. Second Gear!

[SHUZO laughs]

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:53.639

Eat this!

[SHUZO]
Heh. Interesting trick.

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:11.419
You ate a Devil Fruit, I see.

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:12.789
What's it to you?

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.689
Well, whatever that was, pirate,

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:17.459
it can't break through
my Iron Body, I'm afraid!

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:18.599
Oh, yeah?

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.829
[SHUZO laughs]

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:23.699
I told you,
this is a Navy vessel!

Get off my ship!

That's my name.

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:34.179
You ready to pick up
where we left off?

they won't miss.

Nice, Robin!

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:12.319
How odd.

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:14.019
Are they with the Navy?

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.089
Oh, come on!

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:20.159
This just keeps getting more
and more complicated.

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:21.659
What's the plan, Nami?

[NAMI]
Would you hush? Look!

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:25.559
I need to figure out a way
to get Lily's dad back

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:29.466
without getting anyone killed,
so I suggest you don't rush me!

00:07:57.084 --> 00:07:58.454
[NAMI]
Huh?

00:07:58.454 --> 00:08:00.724
What? No way.

00:08:00.724 --> 00:08:02.564
That's the Thrust Up Stream!

Both Luffy and Zoro
are on their guard.

00:08:29.654 --> 00:08:32.154
Those two must
be quite powerful.

00:08:32.154 --> 00:08:33.554
Get lost, ghost head!

00:08:35.124 --> 00:08:37.834
[BROOK gasps]
Excuse you!

00:08:37.834 --> 00:08:39.634
Just because I'm
a disembodied spirit

00:08:39.634 --> 00:08:41.004
doesn't mean
I don't have feelings,

00:08:41.004 --> 00:08:42.934
and I certainly don't
appreciate being shot at!

Sorry I'm late! Ready?

It's complicated, Franky!

There's about to be
another weather change!

00:09:05.594 --> 00:09:07.194
We have to move!

is coming any minute now!

The Thrust Up Stream?

00:09:15.134 --> 00:09:16.364
Sounds deadly.

[USOPP]
Uh-oh.

00:09:17.834 --> 00:09:19.504
Please tell me it's not like
the Knock Up Stream

00:09:19.504 --> 00:09:22.674
we rode up to Sky Island,
because that thing was scary!

00:09:27.174 --> 00:09:28.184
[NAMI]
It is.

00:09:28.184 --> 00:09:31.054
Although it's not quite
that big, at least.

00:09:31.054 --> 00:09:32.484
Good to hear.

00:09:32.484 --> 00:09:34.884
But still, it could blow
one of those ships

clean away!

What?!

00:09:37.894 --> 00:09:39.554
[NAMI] The worst part is,
once it starts,

00:09:39.554 --> 00:09:42.224
we'll have no way of
knowing where it'll pop up!

00:09:42.224 --> 00:09:46.294

back to the Sunny right now!

that's not gonna happen.

00:12:27.824 --> 00:12:29.224
Huh? Why not?

00:12:29.224 --> 00:12:31.234
I didn't notice it before,
but that raft

00:12:31.234 --> 00:12:34.294
is way too big
for that plan to work.

00:12:34.294 --> 00:12:36.204
Well that's no good.

00:12:36.204 --> 00:12:37.904
Argh, think, Nami, think.

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:45.574
Okay! Here's an idea.

00:12:45.574 --> 00:12:46.544
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:12:46.544 --> 00:12:48.084
You think we can use
the force of the

00:12:48.084 --> 00:12:50.484
Thrust Up Stream
to catapult us to safety?

00:12:50.484 --> 00:12:51.384
No way!

00:12:51.384 --> 00:12:53.984
Sorry! Do you guys
have a better idea?

00:12:53.984 --> 00:12:55.254
No, not really.

00:12:55.254 --> 00:12:57.154
But you don't know when
or where it's gonna--

00:12:57.154 --> 00:12:58.494
Save it!

00:12:58.494 --> 00:13:01.324
Sanji. The anchors
are all locked in?

00:13:01.324 --> 00:13:02.224
[SANJI]
Yup!

00:13:02.224 --> 00:13:04.694
Good, then get ready
to hold on tight.

00:13:04.694 --> 00:13:06.494
You'll have to fly on that raft!

00:13:15.844 --> 00:13:17.844
[MARINES yell]

00:13:19.344 --> 00:13:20.544
[USOPP]
Wow!

00:13:20.544 --> 00:13:22.284
It wasn't in the
right spot though!

00:13:22.284 --> 00:13:23.914
Nope. Just wait.

00:13:26.414 --> 00:13:28.284
Hey, uh, should we...?

00:13:28.284 --> 00:13:29.684
A little longer.

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.024
Not yet.

00:13:34.524 --> 00:13:35.594
Wait.

00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:38.734
Now! Go for it!

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:40.564
Chicken Voyage time!

00:13:52.944 --> 00:13:55.144
Now Coup de Burst! Go!

00:14:03.724 --> 00:14:04.594
Luffy!

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:05.724
What the--?!

00:14:14.164 --> 00:14:15.904
Get back here, you punk!

00:14:17.564 --> 00:14:19.634
[NAMI]
Good job, guys, we did it!

00:14:19.634 --> 00:14:22.144
[GROUP]
All right!

00:14:22.144 --> 00:14:23.304
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:14:23.304 --> 00:14:25.974
I can almost taste that
volcano cooking now!

00:14:25.974 --> 00:14:27.274
[BROOK]
Yo ho ho ho!

00:14:27.274 --> 00:14:32.289
Um... Uh, you didn't
forget me, did you?

00:14:59.319 --> 00:15:01.219
So we've lost Panz Fry.

00:15:01.219 --> 00:15:03.959
[SHUZO laughs]

00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:06.159
Unlike you simpletons,
the Neo Navy

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:07.789
never loses its prey.

00:15:07.789 --> 00:15:10.459
Now you know our secret--
our prey is you.

00:15:10.459 --> 00:15:11.929
Goodbye!

00:15:16.229 --> 00:15:17.599
[SHUZO]
Die!

00:15:17.599 --> 00:15:19.609
[MARINES yell]

00:15:34.249 --> 00:15:37.659
I didn't expect to waste
so much time here.

00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:39.119
Don't let them escape.

00:15:47.369 --> 00:15:49.639
[SHUZO yells]

00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:50.699
[SHUZO grunts]

00:16:07.649 --> 00:16:09.049
[NEO MARINE A]
What a battle!

00:16:09.049 --> 00:16:11.519
They've been going at it
for five hours now.

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:13.289
[NEO MARINE B]
They're equal!

00:16:13.289 --> 00:16:15.859
[NEO MARINE C] No, Shuzo
has the advantage here.

00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:22.369
[SHUZO] Looks like she's
finally wearing down.

00:16:22.369 --> 00:16:23.369
Ha!

00:16:23.369 --> 00:16:24.639
I know it hurts.

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:27.009
Let me put you
out of your misery!

00:16:27.009 --> 00:16:29.209
[SHUZO yells]

00:16:31.579 --> 00:16:32.739
I missed her!

00:16:32.739 --> 00:16:35.349
I'll get it this time for sure.

00:16:35.349 --> 00:16:37.919
What?

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:39.919
You have a Devil Fruit power?

00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:46.429
[Z]
It's over. Ain is victorious.

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:52.329
[SHUZO] After her Devil Fruit
ability won her that

00:16:52.329 --> 00:16:53.599
practice match,

00:16:53.599 --> 00:16:56.229
Ain became Master Z's
personal aide,

00:16:56.229 --> 00:17:00.239
and I was tasked with leading
this damn flying squad.

00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:03.239
But soon, everyone will realize
that I'm the only one

00:17:03.239 --> 00:17:06.379
who deserves to be the
master's right-hand man!

00:17:06.379 --> 00:17:08.709
[SHUZO laughing]

00:17:20.389 --> 00:17:21.459
[NAMI]
Okay, everyone,

00:17:21.459 --> 00:17:24.259
we're finally out of
the Maubeugemour Sea.

00:17:24.259 --> 00:17:26.099
The weather's so different here.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:27.969
Much less crazy.

00:17:27.969 --> 00:17:30.599
It's quiet too.

00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:32.899
Yeah, I think we're
out of the woods now!

00:17:32.899 --> 00:17:36.039
There's nobody chasing
us for once.

00:17:36.039 --> 00:17:37.409
No surprise there!

00:17:37.409 --> 00:17:40.109
That was an extra
heavy-duty Coup de Burst.

00:17:40.109 --> 00:17:41.579
Nobody could keep up with that,

00:17:41.579 --> 00:17:43.879
no matter how souped-up
their vessel is!

00:17:43.879 --> 00:17:46.049
In that case, we should be
safe to catch our breath

00:17:46.049 --> 00:17:48.119
behind these reefs for a while.

00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:51.059
I'm sure we could
all use a break.

00:17:51.059 --> 00:17:52.959
Well, Chopper,
how's he holding up?

00:17:58.929 --> 00:18:00.999
This head wound is pretty deep,

00:18:00.999 --> 00:18:03.439
but with some rest
I think he'll be okay.

00:18:03.439 --> 00:18:05.169
Maybe three days?

00:18:05.169 --> 00:18:06.509
That's wonderful!

00:18:06.509 --> 00:18:07.669
Thanks a lot!

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:09.409
You're a great doctor!

00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:12.179
[CHOPPER] Heh...
If you think you can flatter me,

00:18:12.179 --> 00:18:15.409
you got another thing
coming, little big lady!

00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:17.749
[LUFFY] I'm just glad
you're alive, pops.

00:18:17.749 --> 00:18:20.789
So, could you go ahead
and cook us up something?

00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:21.819
Like now?

00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:25.289
What is wrong with you?!

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:27.089
[LILY]
Huh?

00:18:27.089 --> 00:18:28.759
[BROOK]
Yo ho ho ho ho!

00:18:28.759 --> 00:18:32.129
What? It's fine.
Chopper says he's okay, so--

00:18:32.129 --> 00:18:33.499
[CHOPPER]
That's not what I said, Luffy,

00:18:33.499 --> 00:18:35.029
you weren't listening!

00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:38.139
I said he'd be okay
after some rest!

00:18:38.139 --> 00:18:40.709
But... volcano cooking.

00:18:40.709 --> 00:18:43.009
Ugh! Listen, you big pig!

00:18:43.009 --> 00:18:45.479
Even if he did feel like
making something for you,

00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:47.509
there's still one
little problem.

00:18:47.509 --> 00:18:49.279
We have no food to cook!

00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:53.119
Oh! We have plenty
of food, actually!

00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:54.949
Really? Where?

00:18:54.949 --> 00:18:57.189
I don't see it!

00:18:57.189 --> 00:18:59.689
[LILY]
Look! It's on those rocks!

00:18:59.689 --> 00:19:02.029
[BROOK]
Oh, when did that get there?

00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:04.059
When that warship
got blown away,

00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:06.029
the rations they were
carrying started falling

00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:07.629
from the sky!

00:19:07.629 --> 00:19:09.399
So I decided to grab some!

00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:11.369
Couldn't let it go
to waste, right?

00:19:11.369 --> 00:19:13.339
Ha! Nice going, Lily!

00:19:13.339 --> 00:19:15.009
During all that fighting?

00:19:15.009 --> 00:19:16.509
We coulda used
some help, you know.

00:19:16.509 --> 00:19:18.209
Oh, that's true!

00:19:18.209 --> 00:19:20.749
You guys and my dad
could have gotten killed,

00:19:20.749 --> 00:19:22.679
and I was worried
about the food!

00:19:24.649 --> 00:19:26.849
Well, there's alcohol too.

00:19:26.849 --> 00:19:28.149
Oh, that's okay.

00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:29.019
[CHOPPER]
Zoro!

00:19:29.019 --> 00:19:30.419
[BROOK]
Yo ho ho ho ho!

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:31.759
[stomach growls]

00:19:31.759 --> 00:19:32.919
Okay.

00:19:32.919 --> 00:19:34.989
We've got food
and he's not dead.

00:19:34.989 --> 00:19:36.359
He should have
everything he needs

00:19:36.359 --> 00:19:37.529
to make us dinner.

00:19:37.529 --> 00:19:38.759
[CHOPPER, SANJI]
Just forget it!

00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:39.829
Let me cook--

00:19:39.829 --> 00:19:41.699
[rumbling]

00:19:41.699 --> 00:19:42.869
[CHOPPER]
Hey, sit down!

00:19:42.869 --> 00:19:45.269
I told you to get some rest!

00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:47.539
[PANZ grunts]
No. No.

00:19:47.539 --> 00:19:48.839
It's not too strenuous.

00:19:48.839 --> 00:19:50.009
I'll be all right.

00:19:50.009 --> 00:19:51.009
[LILY]
Dad!

00:19:51.009 --> 00:19:54.349
You need to do what
Chopper tells you!

00:19:54.349 --> 00:19:55.679
Luffy.

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:57.749
I believe that was
your name, wasn't it?

00:19:57.749 --> 00:19:58.779
Uh-huh!

00:19:58.779 --> 00:20:01.019
And one day it'll be
"King of the Pirates"!

00:20:01.019 --> 00:20:02.449
[PANZ laughs]

00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:04.919
Careful!

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:08.959
[PANZ]
Lily, listen to me.

00:20:08.959 --> 00:20:10.399
Okay.

00:20:10.399 --> 00:20:13.399
Luffy desperately wants
some volcano cooking,

00:20:13.399 --> 00:20:16.229
and that's something
that only I can prepare.

00:20:16.229 --> 00:20:19.539
And for a cook like me,
there's no greater honor.

00:20:19.539 --> 00:20:21.409
Yeah. I guess that makes sense,

00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:23.039
but if you're
not feeling well...

00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:25.139
Besides, you and I
might've lost our lives

00:20:25.139 --> 00:20:27.109
if not for Luffy
and his friends.

00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:30.619
And if I allow kindness
like that to go unrepaid,

00:20:30.619 --> 00:20:34.319
that's against my code
as a cook and a giant!

00:20:34.319 --> 00:20:36.559
Oh, Dad!

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:39.319
Now, if someone could bring
those ingredients over,

00:20:39.319 --> 00:20:41.059
I'll get started.

00:20:41.059 --> 00:20:43.499
This will be a meal
you won't soon forget!

00:20:43.499 --> 00:20:46.059
[LUFFY]
Really? Thanks a lot, food guy!

00:20:46.059 --> 00:20:47.399
I can't wait!

00:20:47.399 --> 00:20:50.169
No, I'm the one who
should be thanking you.

00:20:50.169 --> 00:20:51.499
I'm in your debt.

00:20:51.499 --> 00:20:52.839
So thank you.

00:20:52.839 --> 00:20:55.739
[LUFFY, LILY chuckle]

00:20:55.739 --> 00:20:57.309
[SANJI]
I'll make something too!

00:20:57.309 --> 00:20:59.679
Whatever the lady would like!

00:20:59.679 --> 00:21:01.609
[LUFFY]
Right, I'll help you out!

00:21:01.609 --> 00:21:03.679
I can carry the bags over!

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:04.979
[BROOK]
Me too!

00:21:04.979 --> 00:21:06.819
[ZORO]
Don't forget the booze.

00:21:06.819 --> 00:21:10.259
Good. Could you go lend
them a hand too, Lily?

00:21:10.259 --> 00:21:12.089
Mm-hmm! Leave it to me!

00:21:21.999 --> 00:21:23.029
[NEO MARINES]
Huh?

00:21:24.299 --> 00:21:25.499
Shuzo, sir!

00:21:25.499 --> 00:21:27.669
I've located the
Straw Hat Pirates.

00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:29.609
It seems that they're all hiding
out on the other side

00:21:29.609 --> 00:21:30.939
of that reef.

00:21:30.939 --> 00:21:32.009
Those cowards!

00:21:32.009 --> 00:21:34.679
I want all ships on
the attack, right now!

00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:38.279
We'll tear the whole reef
apart along with them!

00:21:38.279 --> 00:21:40.619
[NEO MARINE A]
I-I'm sorry, sir, but we used up

00:21:40.619 --> 00:21:43.219
all of our torpedoes
in the last confrontation.

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:46.789
We're almost out
of bombshells too.

00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:48.689
I see. Then we'll--

00:21:48.689 --> 00:21:50.359
[NEO MARINE C]
We can use this submersible.

00:21:51.729 --> 00:21:53.369
[NEO MARINE A]
Uh... Use it how?

00:21:56.229 --> 00:21:57.739
Instead of a torpedo!

00:21:57.739 --> 00:21:59.339
We have to!

00:21:59.339 --> 00:22:00.509
After all...

00:22:00.509 --> 00:22:02.209
We are the Neo Navy.

00:22:02.209 --> 00:22:04.239
We can't give up!

00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:07.879
Trusting you and Master Z
has gotten us this far.

00:22:07.879 --> 00:22:09.649
Why stop now?

00:22:09.649 --> 00:22:12.249
Please, Shuzo, we want
to fight those pirates

00:22:12.249 --> 00:22:14.049
alongside you!

00:22:14.049 --> 00:22:15.519
So do I!

00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:17.019
And me!

00:22:17.019 --> 00:22:18.019
Me too!

00:22:26.899 --> 00:22:29.329
I admire your spirit, soldiers.

00:22:29.329 --> 00:22:31.239
I won't soon forget that.

00:22:31.239 --> 00:22:35.369
Now fight to your hearts'
content, for the proud Neo Navy!

00:22:35.369 --> 00:22:39.039
[NEO MARINES yell]

00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:41.679
[SHUZO] Hit them with
everything we've got!

00:22:57.699 --> 00:23:01.229
And this time...
I won't let you get away!

00:23:01.229 --> 00:23:04.199
Filthy pirates!

00:23:13.609 --> 00:23:15.649
[NARRATOR] After the Neo Navy's
surprise attack,

00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:18.649
Luffy and Shuzo begin a
one-on-one showdown.

00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:21.589
As their back-and-forth
struggle continues to rage,

00:23:21.589 --> 00:23:25.589
Shuzo unexpectedly unleashes a
devastating secret weapon.

00:23:25.589 --> 00:23:28.629
Then, while the Straw Hats are
still reeling from the shock,

00:23:28.629 --> 00:23:31.959
the tiny Lily makes a desperate
but courageous move.

00:23:31.959 --> 00:23:33.769
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

00:23:33.769 --> 00:23:36.899
"Z's Ambition!
Luffy VS. Shuzo!"

00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:39.439
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
