1
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:59,553
Armée de l'Air
Power Shoot!

2
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:04,758
[STRAW HAT PIRATES]
All right!

3
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,026
[PORCHE]
No way!

4
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,096
AAAAHHH!!

5
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,401
[ITOMIMIZU]
Goal! Goal! Goal!

6
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:21,541
Our new champions are
the Straw Hat Pirates!

7
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,281
Shelly!

8
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,249
Huh?

9
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,717
Hahahaha...

10
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,523
[ITOMIMIZU]
What a turn of events!

11
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,360
The captain of the Straw
Hats has chosen Shelly,

12
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,428
a horse that Captain Foxy
picked up on a whim

13
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,763
after coming to this island!

14
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:46,399
Is this pure genius
or just plain idiocy?!

15
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,569
[LUFFY]
There you go, Stilts Guy.

16
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,771
Now you have your horse
back once and for all.

17
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,206
[TONJIT]
How can I thank you?

18
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,642
[LUFFY] Seeing you
together is thanks enough.

19
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,711
This means so much.
Really, thank you.

20
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,446
[sighs]

21
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,382
Well, I guess
I can't blame him.

22
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,518
Yeah. That's totally
what I would've done.

23
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,621
[laughs]

24
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,190
Good girl!

25
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,725
[LUFFY]
I know you can take it.

26
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,496
After all, you're
a man, right?

27
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,797
You bet I am!

28
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,731
[chuckle]

29
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,300
That's our Chopper.

30
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,069
Leave it to me little
pal. You'll be just fine.

31
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,104
If you're Chopper's
last hope. He's screwed.

32
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,105
Eh-heh!

33
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,041
I wonder what the
next game is going to be.

34
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,410
Hmph! Whatever it is,
I'm ready for it.

35
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,511
[chuckles]

36
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,780
We're gonna have Chopper
back on the crew in no time!

37
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,459
[sounds of construction]

38
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,660
[concerned neighing]

39
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:51,365
Shelly don't worry, girl,
our friends will be just fine.

40
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,433
All we can do is cheer them on.

41
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,371
Two fried squids and
a sausage on a stick.

42
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,471
You got it!

43
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,341
[CARPENTER A]
We're still missing

44
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,709
six support pillars over here!

45
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,676
[CARPENTER B]
Hurry it up!

46
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,477
[CARPENTER C]
Hey!

47
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,412
Where'd you
guys put my tools?!

48
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,719
This next game sounds
like fun, don't you think?

49
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,121
[NAMI] Fun? That's
kind of insensitive.

50
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,490
Put yourself in Chopper's
shoes for a second.

51
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,125
Poor little guy.

52
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,760
I didn't think of
that. My apologies.

53
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,798
Well, no big deal.

54
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,570
It's these idiots that could
use some sensitivity training.

55
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,438
Aaaaahh!

56
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,041
Hello! You're
both so lovely!

57
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,110
You two ready
for the match?

58
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,745
What're you
eating now, Luffy?

59
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,046
It's a long kiwi.

60
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,681
That old horse
guy gave it to me.

61
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,049
Actually tastes
pretty good!

62
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:46,720
[LUFFY]
You can't have it.

63
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,655
I don't want it!

64
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:48,789
Mellorine!

65
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,424
[ITOMIMIZU] It's
time for Round 3,

66
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,726
the "Run Roller Round"
roller skating race!

67
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,828
Say that three times fast!

68
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,597
At any rate, it's a
head-to-head race

69
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,765
on an outdoor track.

70
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,234
As always, the rules are simple!

71
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,535
At the sound of
the first whistle,

72
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,704
each team's point
getter will start skating

73
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,073
around the track.
20 seconds later,

74
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,274
the second whistle will blow

75
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,677
and the team defenders
will follow suit.

76
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,179
The defenders can try to
hinder the opposing team

77
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,583
or support their point
getter. Anything goes!

78
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,452
Assuming that the point getters
aren't injured or disqualified,

79
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,554
the race will continue
for five minutes.

80
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:21,588
At the end of that time,

81
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,592
the team whose point
getter is in the lead wins

82
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,428
so as little as an inch
can mean victory or defeat!

83
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,263
Naturally, yours truly
will be providing

84
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:32,199
the play-by-play from my
special "birds nest view"

85
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,267
right next to
the starting line.

86
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,071
Now, it's time for
our two talented teams

87
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,705
to take to the track!

88
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,743
All right guys, no
matter how bad they cheat,

89
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:46,046
we gotta get Chopper
back this time! You ready?

90
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,480
[STRAW HAT PIRATES]
Yeah!

91
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,317
[ITOMIMIZU] And here
come the Straw Hat Dangers

92
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,354
making a grand entrance
with a roaring battle cry!

93
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,193
Feh-feh-feh!

94
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,562
And on this end, their
all-powerful opponents,

95
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,698
the indomitable Foxy Devils!

96
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,801
First up is the
team's playmaker, Porche!

97
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,738
Next is the stunningly
speedy Chiqicheetah,

98
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,140
the defensive dynamo Masshikaku,

99
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,377
the fighting fishman
Jube, and Girarin!

100
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,145
Oh, and last but not least,

101
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,613
we have Foxy as
the head coach

102
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,715
and Hamburg as
the team manager!

103
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,584
That's a mighty lineup
if I've ever seen one!

104
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,329
[sniff, sniff]

105
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,730
Hey, what're you doing?

106
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,799
Whoa! What is
Chiqicheetah up to?

107
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:42,035
Is he intimidating Luffy
before the start of the match?!

108
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,806
What's with this weirdo?
He's kinda creepin' me out.

109
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,143
Feh-feh-feh-feh!

110
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,711
His feet are indeed
a thing of wonder,

111
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,613
but his nose is
impressive too!

112
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,349
You ate something
pungent, didn't you?

113
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:56,350
Huh?

114
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,652
Haha! Uh-oh Luffy,
looks like he's onto you!

115
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,055
That's what you get for
eating that old man's cheese!

116
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,190
[LUFFY]
Oh! Is that why?

117
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,457
That was a joke!

118
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,796
Jeez, learn some
manners, will ya?

119
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,530
Shoo shoo!

120
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,535
[ITOMIMIZU]
Eh.. Ha ha... Wow...

121
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,037
Okay, I don't know
what that was about...

122
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,539
But anyway, now
that that's done with,

123
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,274
let's get back to the rules!

124
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,243
In addition to the
defenders and point getters,

125
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,678
each team also has a
coach and a manager

126
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,813
but unlike the
other players,

127
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,681
they're limited
to the sidelines.

128
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,050
The teams must change
point getters every round,

129
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,553
and each player can
only be point getter once!

130
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:33,487
But wait!

131
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,489
Since the manager
and coach can't play,

132
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,091
that means you need
at least seven members

133
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,361
which makes the
Straw Hats one man short!

134
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,229
Whatever shall they do?!

135
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,130
That's a shame!

136
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,132
But hey, since I'm
such a generous guy,

137
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,369
I'll let one of you sorry
saps be the point getter twice.

138
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,137
If your pride will
allow it, of course.

139
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,139
Feh-feh-feh-feh...!

140
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,607
I've had about
enough of that laugh.

141
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,442
[PIRATE VOICE A] We love
you, Boss! You're the best!

142
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,343
[PIRATE VOICE B]
So kind!

143
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,046
Your generosity has
moved me to tears!

144
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,581
[PIRATE VOICE C]
You're a real man!

145
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:04,752
Aw! Feh-feh-feh! You guys!

146
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:05,686
[NAMI]
Can you believe this guy?

147
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,755
He's actually taking
this crap seriously.

148
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,523
[USOPP] Anything to
feed his ego, right?

149
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,324
[SANJI]
We gotta hurry up

150
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,593
and put this guy
out of his misery.

151
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,195
Oh no! Don't sink,
boss! We need you!

152
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,764
Puh-puh-puh...!

153
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,332
But annoying as he is,

154
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:21,168
we kinda have to take
him up on his offer, right?

155
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,103
Hey, as long as it
helps us beat him faster,

156
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,405
I'm not complaining!

157
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:25,806
We're fighting
for Chopper's sake.

158
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,144
This is no time to
get hung up on pride.

159
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:30,744
Hmm?

160
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:31,745
Huh?

161
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:32,746
You're on, Split Head.

162
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,550
We've got ourselves a
match now! Get ready!

163
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,519
Ha! You're too naïve, boy.

164
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,421
Do you want to know
why I made you an offer

165
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:44,191
that puts me at a
disadvantage? Simple.

166
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,125
'Cause we're awesome.

167
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:49,096
[LUFFY] All right!
Let's get Chopper back!

168
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,698
Yeah!

169
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,132
[PORCHE]
Boss, no!

170
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,434
[ITOMIMIZU]
And there you have it.

171
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,669
Both captains have
agreed to amend the rules!

172
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,304
Now, as soon as
the Straw Hat Dangers

173
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,574
select a point getter for
each round we can begin!

174
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,210
Hhhh... All right, Since
we've got five rounds,

175
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,312
our best bet is to put
our strongest scorers

176
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,448
in rounds 1, 3, and 5.

177
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,450
Question is, who do we
want to start out with?

178
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:12,052
Put me in two rounds,
okay? Please? Please?

179
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,053
I'll think about it,

180
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,322
if you shut up and
leave me alone for a sec.

181
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,058
Since he's so full of energy,

182
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,727
I'll put Luffy as point
getter in round one,

183
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,295
then again in round five.

184
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,463
Yeah!

185
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,501
I probably shouldn't expect
much from Nami and Usopp.

186
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,103
Hey, Robin?

187
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,771
Looks like it's best
to put you in Round 3.

188
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,005
That okay?

189
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,642
Sure. You seem to understand
this better than anyone else.

190
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,776
Thank you.

191
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,112
Ah, but wait what if the
other team has the same idea?

192
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:40,814
[thinking]
Okay, new plan.

193
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,150
[LUFFY]
Okay, come on! Hurry up!

194
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,018
All right, I'm done!

195
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,754
Luffy has rounds 1 and 5.

196
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:50,491
Nami has 2. Usopp has 3
and Robin has been moved to 4.

197
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:51,492
Hey, hold on a sec.

198
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:52,793
Why do you get to make
all these big decisions

199
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,295
without asking me?

200
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,597
Huh? 'Cause the coach
makes all the decisions,

201
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,066
not the manager.
And I'm the coach.

202
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,568
And why do you get to
have the awesome job,

203
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,603
while I get stuck following
your stupid orders?!

204
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,639
Obviously because I'm a genius
and your brain is so rotten

205
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,441
you're growing
mold on your head.

206
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,475
If you think you're a genius,

207
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:11,378
then your ego is as
twisted as your eyebrows.

208
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:12,446
What?!

209
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,148
By the way,
there's one more

210
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,817
very important rule
we need to go over.

211
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,520
[NAMI]
Knock it off! I can't hear him!

212
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,488
[ITOMIMIZU] If any of
the racers go in reverse,

213
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,357
or leave the course
for whatever reason,

214
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,427
they will be immediately
disqualified from the game.

215
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,796
Starting before the whistle
means disqualification, as well!

216
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,468
Okay, looks like
everything is finally set!

217
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,103
In the first round...

218
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,706
Oh! Coming on
strong from the start!

219
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,408
It's Straw Hat Luffy
versus our very own Porche!

220
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,410
The anticipation is killing me.

221
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,447
So without further ado,
let's get this thing started!

222
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,249
[PIRATE VOICE D]
Man, talk about exciting!

223
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:48,883
[PIRATE VOICE E]
No kidding!

224
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,384
This is my favorite event!

225
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,652
[PIRATE VOICE C]
Yeah, mine too!

226
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:52,753
Go Porche!

227
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,789
Beat that rubber
dude senseless!

228
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:59,125
Hahaha! Hey, look!

229
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,295
[gasp]

230
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,197
You're kidding me.

231
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,397
No way.

232
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:11,071
Whoa, this
is kinda hard.

233
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,478
Please, somebody tell
me I'm seeing things!

234
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,646
No, don't make me look!

235
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,381
I'm scared! Make it go away!

236
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,121
[CROWD jeers]

237
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,589
[ITOMIMIZU]
Now this is unexpected!

238
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,558
Straw Hat doesn't
know how to skate!

239
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,659
And according to the roster,

240
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,362
he's scheduled to play
point getter in two rounds!

241
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,631
Is the game over
before it's even started?

242
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,566
Feh-feh-feh!

243
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,168
You can race as many
times as you like, kid!

244
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,544
Now what're we gonna do?

245
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,580
Wait a second if we
can't count on Luffy,

246
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,415
then that means
everyone's gonna expect me

247
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:55,616
to win the third round!

248
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:03,089
[CROWD jeers]

249
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,646
[ITOMIMIZU] Both teams
have finally made it

250
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,547
to the starting line,

251
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,082
but I'm beginning
to wonder if this is

252
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,717
going to be much of a race.

253
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,253
At any rate, let's see
what happens, shall we?

254
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:33,387
Why'd you ask to
be in two rounds

255
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,389
if you don't even
know how to skate?!

256
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,256
It's not my fault,

257
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,758
that was before
I found out that skating

258
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,626
is the hardest
thing in the world!

259
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,497
We're doomed!
It's all over now!

260
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,798
Don't give up just yet.

261
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,067
It's our job to
pick up the slack.

262
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:48,602
Come on guys, let's go!

263
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,204
Point Getters to the track!

264
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:51,772
What?! Not you again!

265
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,207
If you pull any more stunts

266
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,276
you're getting a
boot to the face!

267
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,411
Feh-feh-fe!

268
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,213
We don't need
"stunts" this time.

269
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:02,115
We could beat you with both
hands tied behind our backs!

270
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,052
[ITOMIMIZU]
It's time for the third game!

The Run Roller Round!

272
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,056
Will Porche breeze
through to an easy victory,

273
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,724
or will the rookie
skater Straw Hat

274
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,226
make a miraculous
improvement?!

275
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:17,731
[REFEREE]
On your marks! Get set.

276
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,532

[ITOMIMIZU]
And she's off!

00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,139

track with spectacular speed!

279
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,474
Now, let's check in on
our challenger, Luffy!

280
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,577
Oh! He's flat on his face!

281
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,612
He didn't even make it
across the starting line!

282
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,415
Certainly is
hard-headed, isn't he?

283
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,284
You, stupid shoes!

284
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:38,219
[ITOMIMIZU] Whoa, now!
Removing your skates

285
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:41,488
will result in instant
disqualification!

286
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,589
Crap!

287
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,028
If I make it over there,
I can grab the railing!

288
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,133
Well! Not much of a race!

289
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,535
[whistle blow]

290
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,370
[ITOMIMIZU]
Twenty seconds have passed!

291
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:59,306
It's time to let
the defenders loose!

00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,144
Hey! He's about
to get pinned!

294
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,145
Somebody, help him!

295
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,047
Not me!!

[MASSHIKAKU]
Huh? That's weird.

297
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,121
Huh?

Listen Luffy, you have to
keep holding your breath!

the way around the track!

Wow, thanks Robin!

Awesome!

00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,554
[ITOMIMIZU]
What incredible speed!

311
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,323
You can hardly
call it skating,

312
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:52,259
but he's definitely
catching up to Porche!

313
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,695
Oh no! Flower Shuriken!

314
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,800
Uh-oh!

00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,035
Amazing!
This is certainly the

316
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:06,273
most bizarre comeback
I've ever seen! But wait!

317
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,474
The Foxy Devils
have lined up

318
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,609
some powerful defense!

I am a wall.

00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,086
Huh?

00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,621
[ITOMIMIZU] Oh! But a
fancy flying maneuver

322
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,756
sends him sailing
over Masshikaku!

323
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,492
It's only a matter of time
before he catches up to Porche!

his way out of bounds!

This is bad.

336

Since we can't count on Luffy,

337
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:12,506
that means me, Robin,
and Usopp all have to win.

338
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,509
At this rate, Chopper might
not be the only one we lose!

[ITOMIMIZU] As expected,
the winner of the first round

341
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,248
is the lovely Porche!
As you know,

342
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,817
that means one point
for the Foxy Devils!

get down here!

00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:35,062
is Nami, the
nefarious navigator!

349
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,630
She'll be up against
the king of defense.

350
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:41,602
Masshikaku, everyone's
favorite human wall!

351
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,638
Don't worry about losing,
just focus on the match!

352
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:51,312
Round #2! On your
marks, get set.

353
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:54,148
[whistle blow]

354
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,249
[ITOMIMIZU]
And they're off!

355
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:58,252
Or at least Nami is,
Masshikaku on the other hand.

356
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:01,755
Well, to put it nicely,
let's say he's taking his time.

357
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:02,856
It looks like the
heartless witch

358
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,093
might be able to win without
any conniving this time!

359
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,628
Am I missing something?
Why's he so slow?

360
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,801
[thinking]
It's too quiet what's going on?

361
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:16,170
Is this some kind of trick?

362
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,772
[USOPP] Forget about him,
Nami! Just keep moving!

363
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:19,673
Right!

364
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,640
[whistle blow]

365
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:22,243
[ITOMIMIZU]
And there's the second whistle!

366
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:24,044
Let's see what we can do.

367
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,351
Wait. Why aren't they moving?

368
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,685
Heh heh heh heh...

369
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,221
If you think you can get
past us, then be my guest!

370
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,624
[GIRARIN] You wanna
step up to these babies?

371
00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:38,392
Little late to be
making a roadblock.

372
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,327
We're the ones in
the lead this time.

373
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,329
If you guys don't
move, then I will!

374
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:45,666
Take it easy Luffy,
we got this one!

375
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:46,767
Look how slow he is.

376
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,236
There's no way Nami's
gonna lose against that guy!

377
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:50,370
Huh?

378
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,273
Hmph... Is that what you think?

379
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,141
Huh?

380
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,376
Hmm?

381
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:00,380
Flower Hypnosis!

382
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:19,499
[motorized skate noises]

383
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:24,505
What happened?

384
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:27,107
We didn't just fall
asleep on the track, did we?

385
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,242
I'm not sure.

386
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,343
[USOPP]
Luffy! Guys! Wake up!

387
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:38,152
But they're in the same
place as before, right?

388
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,553
Yeah.

389
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:44,725
[CHOPPER] Nami! Hurry!
You're about to lose the race!

390
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,794
You gotta get moving now!

391
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:47,828
[ITOMIMIZU]
Four!

392
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:48,528
Why would I...

393
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:53,167
[ITOMIMIZU]
Three! Two! One!

394
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,768
[whistle blow]

395
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,739
[ITOMIZMIZU] The Foxy Devils
win two rounds in a row!

396
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:01,475
One more and it's all
over for the Dangers!

397
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:02,643
That can't be.

398
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:03,610
He's in the same spot,

399
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,679
but that's only cause
he did a whole lap.

400
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:08,449
Snooze you lose!
It sucks to be you, huh?

401
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,150
Feh-feh-feh!

402
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,353
Can't believe we beat
'em with Masshikaku!

403
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:14,521
Puh-puh-puh...

404
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,323
Are you kidding?!

405
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,293
[ITOMIMIZU] Unless the
Straw Hats can pull it

406
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,196
together fast, things could
be over for them in a flash!

407
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:23,097
With a two point deficit,

408
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,399
everything is riding
on the next round!

409
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,800
Will Usopp's
aerodynamic nose give him

410
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,769
the edge he needs
to beat Chiqicheetah?

411
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:32,706
But I'm aller--

Don't you dare try to tell us

413
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,508
you're allergic
to roller skates!

414
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,386
[thinking] How can I beat a
guy with "cheetah" in his name?

415
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,788
Heck, he might even be a
cheetah, now that I look at him.

416
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:48,522
[LUFFY]
Ow!

417
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:49,590
That's all wrong.

418
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:51,458
Try to lower your
stance a little.

419
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,160
You gotta use your
hips when you move.

420
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,763
I never figured you
for a skater! Wow!

421
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:56,764
[ZORO] I'm not. I just
watched other people do it.

422
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,299
[thinking] I can't rely
on Luffy for this one.

423
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:00,301
What I need is a strategy!

424
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:01,735
[ZORO]
Spread them out a little.

425
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,437

Huh. Like this?

426
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,305
Ow!

427
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:05,439
[ZORO]
Not even close.

428
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:07,074

No! Listen to me, damn it!

On your marks! Get set.

[USOPP thinking]
I got nothing! Well, whatever!

435
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:20,320
I can go faster than a cheetah
if I try really hard, right?!

436
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:29,029
Ah ha! I'm in the
lead! It worked!

AHHHH!!!

00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,498
So fast!

00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:33,534
Eh-heh! Your little friend
might as well give up now

440
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,802
and save himself the effort.

441
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:37,271
Chiqicheetah doesn't even
need our help, ya know.

442
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:40,574
[USOPP] This is hopeless!
What am I supposed to do?!

443
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,112
No way! He already
finished a whole lap?!

444
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:47,514
Maybe you guys should
just sit back and relax too!

'til it's over, okay?

That's twenty seconds!

00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:55,656
Right.

it up, just like I said.
