00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.005
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:08.074
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.213
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.415
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.587
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.522
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:26.726
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.591
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.528
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:46.799
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.235
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.572
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.440
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.876
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.712
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:04.184
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.818
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:09.522
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:13.793
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:18.464
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:21.301
Luffy and his crew
arrive on Fishman Island,

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:25.338
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.707
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.712
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.882
[NARRATOR] It's not long
before the Straw Hats

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:38.084
get pulled into the conflict,

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:42.288
which results in Hordy detaining
Zoro, Usopp, and Brook.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:46.859
My soul. It's aching!

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.128
Wait. That's it!

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:54.133
[DECKEN laughing]

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:55.435
[DECKEN LACKEY A]
What's so funny?

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:57.170
My idea!

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:59.005
If I can't end her existence,

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:02.075
then I'll just have to
end everyone else's!

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:03.276
[DECKEN chuckles]

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.877
It's settled.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:08.414
That boy sure gave me a
lot of trouble, though.

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:11.017
We're leaving Hachi
in your care, Camie!

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.252
[CAMIE]
Right!

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:14.087
Let us make haste, Megalo!

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.622
[MEGALO]
Shaa!

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:20.493
[PRINCES groaning]

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:24.764
This drug of yours is
fearsome indeed, Hordy.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:32.405
[laughing]

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.444

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:46.319
[JIMBEI] All right.
We're almost to the plaza!

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:48.721
Keep up the pace, Megalo!

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:50.556
Hold on, Father.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.826
[NEPTUNE]
Hey! I'm here, jamon!

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.230
Jimbei, just ahead! It's him!

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:59.832
[NEPTUNE]
Hey! I'm here, jamon!

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:02.435
You can't imagine how
happy I am to see you!

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:03.536
[JIMBEI]
Hm?

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:07.774
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Father!

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:08.441
Huh?

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.443
Wait! We're coming!

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.312
Hold on! Don't do it!

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:16.349
[SHIRAHOSHI]
It's going to be okay!

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:17.617
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.886
[SHIRAHOSHI screams]

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.121
[JIMBEI groans]

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.090
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]
What are you doing to me?

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:26.125
Stay away from her!

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.361
No.

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:32.565
And if you don't want this to
get ugly, best to come quietly.

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:34.133
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Let me go!

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.868
[SHIRAHOSHI groans]

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:38.571
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE A]
Good! Take her to Hordy!

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:45.011
[FISHMEN murmuring]

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:49.882
No way!

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:51.984
[DARUMA laughs]

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.654
[ZEO] This is quite the
audience we've gathered.

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:01.527
[NEPTUNE]
Curse the lot of you!

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:04.230
Now this is quite the sight.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.334
[FISHMAN AA]
Prince Mamboshi!

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.203
[FISHMAN BB]
Prince Ryuboshi!

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:12.305
[FISHWOMAN C]
Prince Fukaboshi!

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:13.206
[FISHMAN B]
But how?

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:15.375
They're just a bunch
of pirates, right?

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:16.342
The princes were winning,

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.511
but then it was like
they just fell apart!

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:19.679
Not good.

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:22.115
If they can't save the king,
I don't think anyone can!

00:06:22.148 --> 00:06:25.485
[DOSUN] Let's go! I wanna
lay down some more boomsun!

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:28.721
If I get any hotter,
I'm gonna dry-hii out!

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:32.892
[ZEO] Heh, heh. First the
soldiers and ministers,

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:34.961
then the royal family.

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:37.196
Truly, there is no one
left in this country

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.098
who can oppose us now.

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:41.467
I can't believe
how strong they are!

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:44.337
Please forgive us,
Father. We failed.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.038
[NEPTUNE]
Don't be ashamed.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:48.875
The strength that bested you
is not truly their own.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.577
That doesn't matter if it
lets them take over the country!

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:53.513
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE E]
Kill 'em already, Captain Hordy!

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:55.047
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE F]
Burn 'em alive!

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.416
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE G]
No, impale them!

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.385
Oh, yeah! After all,
that's the least they deserve!

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.387
If they wanna go and
side with humans,

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.989
then they can die without pride!

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:05.458
C'mon! Everyone came for a show!

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:07.627
Do it. Now!

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.997
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Kill them now! Kill them now!

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:17.970
Kill them now! Kill them now!
Kill them now! Kill them now!

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:20.540
Kill them now! Kill them now...

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.041
[HORDY]
That's enough.

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:23.876
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Huh?

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.880
[HORDY]
We haven't heard from Decken,

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:32.952
which means that Shirahoshi
is still out there somewhere.

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:37.457
Once she comes for them,
we'll kill them all!

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.792
You leave our sister
out of this!

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:41.961
She's not a fighter like us!

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:45.298
So she isn't a threat
to you, Hordy Jones!

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:46.999
[HORDY]
You honestly think I don't know

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:50.536
the truth about
your little sister?

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.339
She's the only one
of you with true power.

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:56.609
She may be meek,
but she's far from helpless.

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.544
I want her gone most of all.

00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:00.480
You monster!

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:01.814
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE A]
Captain Hordy!

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:02.949
[HORDY]
Hm?

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:06.118
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE A]
Got a special delivery for ya!

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:09.322
[SHIRAHOSHI screams]

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.691
[ALL gasp]

00:08:11.724 --> 00:08:13.726
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE A]
We didn't even need to fight!

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:16.162
We caught 'em in a trap!

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:17.864
[ALL]
Shirahoshi!

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:21.167
[gasps] I'm sorry!
I wanted to save you!

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.903
There we go. That was fast.

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:26.839
[laughs]

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:28.641
[HORDY]
In one fell swoop, we captured

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:31.077
the two I was most
concerned about.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.614
I knew I would win,
but not this easily!

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:37.950
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps] All of this
is my fault, isn't it, Jimbei?

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.151
I'm so sorry.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.053
If I hadn't been so foolish,

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:43.322
then you wouldn't
be in this mess.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:46.425
What's done is done,
child. Don't cry.

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:50.296
Now, Jimbei. Welcome.

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:53.132
I must say, this does
disappoint me a bit.

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:54.333
You used to be strong.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.435
Then I guess we've both changed.

00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:57.436
Look at you.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.872
Why, you're nothing
but a monster now!

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:01.507
They got Boss Jimbei!

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.109
What's he even doing here?

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:05.011
Didn't he leave after
he quit the Warlords?

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:07.480
But I thought
Princess Shirahoshi

00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:09.782
was kidnapped by
Straw Hat Luffy.

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:13.486
Did Jimbei rescue her only
to get them both captured?

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:17.156
[HORDY] I was ready for a
fight, but I won't complain.

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:21.627
Everyone I needed is neatly
gathered here, just as planned.

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:25.298
Now, the only concern
I have left...

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:27.500
...is the Straw Hats.

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:30.670
Although, I'm sure they're
more than a little preoccupied

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:31.704
at the moment.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:34.874
Trying to find a way
into the palace.

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:35.975
I assume they'll come here

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:38.611
after they discover
their friends are dead.

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:41.180
And once they do,

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:45.318
we'll be ready.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:04.236
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE H chuckles]

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:18.484
That is my army.

00:10:18.517 --> 00:10:22.121
Thirty-thousand slaves
we've captured this month.

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:24.223
All human, too.

This is madness!

They're all from
the Fishman District,

or can't you tell?

Just outside are

More slaves. Although
they can't fight.

00:11:59.952 --> 00:12:03.089
Well, I'm sure we can
find a use for them later.

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:05.858
And they're only the
first of many humans

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:08.094
we will enslave
in the coming days!

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:10.162

[HORDY] My men are in
need of places to stay,

to be accommodating

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:17.336
by leaving your homes.

Whether you do that by
running away or dropping dead

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:22.141
makes no difference to me.

00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:24.543

quit while you're ahead,

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:36.255
Hordy Jones.

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:39.058
It's been a long time, Sharley.

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:41.594
Is there a reason you're here?

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:44.096
[SHARLEY] Yes, I wanted
to deliver a message,

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.166
while you're still at
the height of your glory.

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:49.401
What did she just say?

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:50.703
[SHARLEY]
I recently had a vision

00:12:50.736 --> 00:12:53.372
of the imminent destruction
of our island.

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:56.175
It was a fate brought
on by a single man.

00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:57.243
Oh, yeah?

00:12:57.276 --> 00:13:00.212
I guess could call
this "destruction."

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:03.382
So was it me that you
saw in your prophecy?

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.051
[SHARLEY]
No.

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:07.319
[HORDY]
Huh?

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:10.990
[SHARLEY] The man who will
destroy Fishman Island

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:13.392
is Straw Hat Luffy.

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:16.862
That can't be!

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:19.198
Oh, but I'm afraid it can.

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:21.901
That said, I don't know how.

00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:24.670
The means, well, they're
still a mystery to me.

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:26.672
What exactly's your point?

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:29.008
[SHARLEY]
My point is, it's not you.

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:30.042
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:32.311
[SHARLEY]
Fine. I'll spell it out.

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:34.113
No matter what you think
you're accomplishing,

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:38.884
the person who decides the fate
of this island... isn't you.

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:41.287
It's a human.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.523
Hear that? Madam Sharley's
visions are always accurate!

00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:45.791
Yeah!

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:49.094
That means Hordy will never be
in control of Fishman Island!

00:13:49.128 --> 00:13:51.130
No matter what he does!

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:04.009
[SHARLEY gasps]

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:06.312
[gasps]

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:10.549
[SHARLEY groans]

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.618
[FISHMEN gasp]

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.887
[FISHMAN CC]
Madam Sharley!

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:40.446
Sharley, no!

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:41.947
How could he do that?

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:44.016
What a load of crap!

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:47.253
What did you hope
to accomplish? Huh?

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:48.487
Come on, let's hear it!

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.155
[groans]

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:53.592
Sharley. You know I'm
nothing like your brother.

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:55.628
[HORDY]
It's true.

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:58.230
I looked up to him
a lot when I was a kid.

00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:01.767
That's how everybody was
with Arlong back then.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.905
However, that changed
when we acquired real power.

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:07.940
We didn't take the name
"Arlong Pirates"

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:09.475
out of reverence to him.

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:11.877
All we needed was a
flag to rally behind.

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:15.114
A symbol to unite
people like us.

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:17.583
And now, that symbol
has served its purpose.

00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:20.619
We have surpassed Arlong in
strength and ambition alike.

00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:23.389
There's only one man capable
of destroying this country

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:26.292
and building something better.

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:28.594
And that's me, you got it?

00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:31.263
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be here, right?

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:33.499
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES cheer]

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:36.635
You see? This is power!

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:41.140
Because my followers
have faith in change!

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:42.908
It's taken ten years,

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:46.912
but it's time that we finished
what I began so long ago!

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.281
And you know what started it?

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:51.617
The death of Queen Otohime!

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.851
Yes, that's right!

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:55.821
I've got a little
secret! Wanna hear?

00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:58.624
[ALL gasp]

00:15:58.657 --> 00:16:03.162
[HORDY] When she was killed,
the one who shot her...

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.599
[HORDY]
...was me!

00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:15.507
That can't be true!

00:16:19.278 --> 00:16:20.412
Oh, no.

00:16:20.446 --> 00:16:23.082
The human. But what about him?

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:24.750
We saw him.

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:27.853
I can't believe
in all these years,

00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:31.023
you idiots never
figured it out! [laughs]

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:35.494
The day before,
I had made a deal.

00:16:35.527 --> 00:16:38.597
[PIRATE A groans]
I got no clue who you are,

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.299
and I don't really care.

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:42.067
As long as you got
money to pay me,

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:44.436
I'll do whatever it is ya want.

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:48.941
[PIRATE A chuckles]
That's what I'm talkin' about!

00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:51.010
[HORDY]
Consider this a down payment.

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:54.246
I'll give you the other half
after you finish the job.

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:56.815
[PIRATE A] Mister,
you have yourself a deal!

00:16:56.849 --> 00:17:00.919
Just this alone is enough
to keep me drunk fer a week.

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:06.225
So, what d'you want me to do?

00:17:06.258 --> 00:17:08.093
Don't worry, it's quite simple.

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:09.828
Even a child could do it.

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:14.500
That said, do not
let anyone see you.

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:19.805
[HORDY]
And when the moment came...

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:32.885
[FISHMAN GG]
Get away! Fire! Fire!

00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:33.886
[FISHMAN DD]
We need water!

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:34.787

Hurry!

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.288

Secure the royal family!

00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:37.956

Quick! Put it out!

00:17:50.502 --> 00:17:53.338
[AMMO KNIGHT B]
Queen Otohime has been shot!

00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:57.509
[PIRATE A] Hey! Hurry up
and pay me already!

00:17:57.543 --> 00:17:59.878
I torched all those signatures
like you told me to,

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:01.313
so I've earned my cut!

00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:02.915
But still, I gotta
get outta here

00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:04.750
before those guards
come lookin' for me!

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:06.185

[gasps]

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:12.057
What's the big idea?

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:14.393
Humans are so stupid.

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:17.563
[gasps] No. Damn it!

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:18.831

[JIMBEI grunts]

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:29.007
[HORDY]
It was a human.

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:32.845
A human assassinated our queen!

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:35.881
This is what humans
are capable of!

00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:39.585
Killing in cold blood!

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:45.724
[HORDY chuckles]
And that was all it took

00:18:45.757 --> 00:18:48.627
to fool every single one of you!

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.362
[JIMBEI grunting]

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:52.197
No! Damn you!

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:54.566
He killed our queen!

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.503

Hordy, you bastard!

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:01.406

[FISHMEN crying]

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:03.976
No! Don't!

00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:05.144
Father, please!

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:07.379
Hordy, stop it right now!

00:19:07.412 --> 00:19:09.414

[FISHMEN crying]

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:16.255
[HORDY]
She was a nuisance.

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.190
Right, Shirahoshi?

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:22.828
Always telling us to
forget about revenge.

00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:26.331
And then begging us all to try
and be friends with the humans!

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:30.802
Worst of all, she was so close
to getting what she wanted.

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:35.040
I knew just murdering her
wasn't going to cut it anymore.

00:19:35.073 --> 00:19:36.542
It wasn't enough.

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:38.944
I had to kill her dream.

00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:42.481
Only then would your
mother truly die!

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:44.917
Shut your mouth!
Leave her alone!

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.218
How dare you!

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:50.088
And so, I came up
with a strategy.

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:53.759
I would use her death
to my advantage!

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:55.327
With that one simple act,

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.462
I could change the direction
this country was moving

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:59.264
in to my favor.

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:02.167
I rekindled the
hatred, the fear,

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:04.336
our people thought
they'd forgotten.

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:05.904
Then, just like that,

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:10.175
the islanders' hopes died
alongside their queen.

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:12.678
That's it.

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:14.179
One human.

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.515
That was all that it took.

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:21.520
[HORDY] If I made one
of them my scapegoat,

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:24.389
I knew our people would feel
so angry and so betrayed

00:20:24.423 --> 00:20:26.425
that they would
never question it.

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:29.027
As it turned out, it wasn't
even that difficult!

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.129
Every person on the
island bought into it

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:33.532
exactly like I wanted!

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:38.470

without a few sacrifices.

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:40.239
Right, Princess?

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:42.708
Even in her death,
your mother changed the island

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:45.677
by turning the humans
into villains once more.

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:48.113
And yet, it wasn't them.

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:51.116
No, it was her own subject.

00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:53.518
The fishman standing
in front of you!

00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:55.988
I did it! I killed her!

00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:58.957
Because it was necessary!

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.974
I knew you did it.

[DECKEN] A long time ago,
the people of Fishman Island

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:36.728
came together to build
a mysterious giant ship.

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:38.697
They called it "Noah."

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.300
The reason why they
did this is unknown,

00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:44.770
hence the mysterious
part, obviously.

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:48.173
Anyhow, it's nothing but a
forgotten piece of the past,

00:21:48.206 --> 00:21:50.776

with my right hand.

Captain Decken,

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.446
what are you up to, exactly?

Uh, guys? What's going on?

[DECKEN]
It's over.

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:14.633

never go away, I suspect.

[DECKEN LACKEY A]
I don't know what to do!

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:30.549
[DECKEN LACKEY B]
Just run!

00:22:30.582 --> 00:22:33.185
I've thrown Noah at Shirahoshi.

00:22:33.218 --> 00:22:36.221
So now, I'm out of here!

00:22:36.254 --> 00:22:37.689
[FLYING PIRATES]
What?

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:38.924
[DECKEN LACKEY A]
Wait, this ship is

00:22:38.957 --> 00:22:40.959
half the size of Fishman Island!

00:22:40.992 --> 00:22:43.762
That means, when this thing
reaches the princess,

00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:45.097
it won't just crush her,

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.132
everything will be destroyed!

00:22:47.165 --> 00:22:50.068
You can't run from
me anymore, Princess!

00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:52.137
From now until the end of time,

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:56.241
you can live on right here
in my heart, but only there!

00:22:56.274 --> 00:22:58.410
Goodbye, my darling!

00:22:58.443 --> 00:23:02.614
I hope you burn in hell
like my love burned for you!

00:23:02.647 --> 00:23:06.318
And good riddance
to Fishman Island!

00:23:06.351 --> 00:23:10.088
[DECKEN cackles]

00:23:14.126 --> 00:23:16.027
[NARRATOR] Even in the
face of Hordy's cruelty,

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:18.864
Shirahoshi holds true to
her mother's dying wish.

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:21.032
The burden she
carried for ten years

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:22.534
is finally brought to light,

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:25.470
as the Ryugu Kingdom lies
on the brink of destruction.

00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:26.772
The people of Fishman Island,

00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:29.007
recalling Madam
Sharley's prophecy,

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.711
call out to a man who may
bring ruin and rebirth alike.

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:34.546
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:38.283 --> 00:23:38.316
"Shirahoshi's Tears!
Luffy Finally Shows Up!"

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:38.383
"Shirahoshi's Tears!
Luffy Finally Shows Up!"
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:40.919
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
