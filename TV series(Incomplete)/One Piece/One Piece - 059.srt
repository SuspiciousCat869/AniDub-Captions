[GOLD ROGER]
Destiny. Fate. Dreams.

2
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,190
These unstoppable ideals are
held deep in the heart of man.

3
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:27,560
As long as there are people
who seek freedom in this life,

4
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,697
these things shall not
vanish from the earth!

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,373
<i>People tell me my</i>

6
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,641
<i>I don't care what they say</i>

7
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,476
<i>because I'm dreamin' of you</i>

8
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,446
<i>You are the treasure I've found</i>

9
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,215
<i>So bright, so bold,</i>
<i>yet so elusive</i>

10
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,718
<i>It's hard to look away,</i>

11
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,788
<i>even though it's blinding me</i>

12
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,456
<i>There are no words to describe</i>

13
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,391

<i>I'm really really stuck</i>

15
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,396
<i>I have to follow my dreams</i>

16
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,831
<i>however crazy they seem</i>

17
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,301
<i>And I won't stop 'til I</i>

18
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:09,469
<i>You're all I need</i>

19
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,638
<i>to have the strength to believe</i>

20
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:17,777
<i>Believe in Wonderland!</i>

21
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,915
<i>I'm gonna follow my dreams,</i>

22
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,583
<i>however crazy they seem</i>

23
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,185
<i>I'm gonna share them with you,</i>

24
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,753

25
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,290
<i>You're all I want,</i>

00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,829
<i>we have the power of love</i>

29
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:39,199

30
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,635
<i>We have the chance</i>

[roaring]

33
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,453
I see its fangs!
What are you waiting for?!

34
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,070
[LUFFY]
Grandpa Ryu!

35
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,244
Hang in there. I'll help you!

36
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:32,318
Grandpa!

00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,020

39
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,432
Hang in there!

40
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,668
Look, I've never been
to the Dragons' Nest,

41
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,671
but I don't think
it's down there!

42
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,673
Please don't die.

43
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,074
Grandpa Ryu!

44
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,509
Damn those Marines!

45
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,443
Not good!

46
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,747
Yeah. It looks like
the dragon can't swim.

47
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,629
[sighs]

48
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,466
What a relief. That beast
was headed right for me.

49
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,269
[MARINE A] Commodore! The
Millennial Dragon is sinking!

50
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,370
It's fine.

51
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,139
There's still time to reach him.

52
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,142
Drag in the carcass
with a harpoon.

53
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,593
That's it. Aim high!

54
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,395
Now take your best shot!

55
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,164
Fire!

56
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,767
[BOTH gasp]

57
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,676
Wha‐‐?!

58
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,815
That wasn't nice.

59
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,618
[NELSON laughing]

60
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,320
[NELSON] You've no idea the
value of that stupid animal

61
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,289
you're standing on!

62
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:22,262
You can keep the dragon.
I just want its bones!

63
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,530
With the Dragonite
in my possession,

64
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,468
nothing can prevent me from
attaining the ultimate power:

65
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,770
Everlasting life!

66
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,107
[NELSON laughing]

67

[screams]

68
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,163
This dragon has a name!

69
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,632
It's Grandpa Ryu, jerk!
Ya got that?

70
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,835
And he has every intention of
keeping his bones to himself!

71
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,504
You try my patience!

72
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,906
For your insolence, you can
sink to the bottom of the sea

73
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,174
with your dragon!

74
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,410
Now prepare for your punishment!

75
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,712
Destroy that obnoxious brat!

76
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,514
Uh... Um, but, Sir,

77
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,350
we can't destroy the boy
without obliterating the dragon!

78
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,820
So what?! Bone fragments
will serve my purpose fine!

79
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:21,754
[OFFICER]
Yes, sir!

80
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,423
Ready the cannons!

81
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,824
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

82
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,666
You're fine with staying here?!

83
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,735
Well, I'm not.
You gotta fight back!

84
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,504
You haven't accomplished
your goal, remember?

85
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,340
What happened to going
home to your nest?

86
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,710
Don't give up on your dream
when you've gotten this close!

87
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,944
Sure I will.

88
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,580
Don't worry about Apis.
I'll protect her.

89
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,449
You need to stop worrying
about everyone else

90
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,217
and think about yours‐‐

91
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,228
[APIS] Please, you've gotta
untie these ropes!

92
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,363
Grandpa Ryu needs my help!

93
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,364
[USOPP]
What's that?!

94
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,533
[APIS] It's up to me!
I can't let him down!

95
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,569
He'll be safe with Luffy!
I promise!

96
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,638
No! You're not listening!
I have to go!

97
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,309
If anyone can save
the dragon, it's him!

98
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,478
[NAMI]
The entire sea is shaking.

99
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,748
Oh, come on! As if we don't
have enough problems!

100
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,333
[LUFFY] What the‐‐?!
What's going on?! Hey.

101
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,308
Really?

102
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,946
Oh, so that's it.

103
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,750
[NELSON]
What's going on?

104
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,352
[OFFICER]
Uh. I don't know, Sir!

105
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,855
There aren't any underwater
volcanoes in this area.

106
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:07,293
No matter! Fire! Fire! Fire!

107
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,469
[yelps]

108
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:27,980
[roars]

109
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,318
I get it!

110
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,988
That's it!

111
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,791
You're calling some of your
friends, aren't you?!

112
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,397
He's calling them.

113
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,700
[USOPP] Calling them?
Exactly who's he calling?

114
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,001
The others.

115
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:49,502
[BOTH]
Huh?

116
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,471
What do you mean?

117
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,577
He's calling out to all
the other Millennial Dragons,

118
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,345
telling them it's time.

119
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,012
Finally.

120
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,748
Time for what precisely?

121
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,750
I'm confused.

122
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,590
[USOPP stammers]

123
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,024
Wh‐What's that?!

124
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,493
[NAMI, APIS]
Huh?

125
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,612
Who knew that Grandpa Ryu
had so many friends!

126
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,914
A whole army of dragons!

127
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,216
What the...?

128
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,918
Where did these
things come from?!

129
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,853
[laughing]

130
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,555
Huh? Oh my!

131
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,890
[laughing]

132
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,126
Look at this!
A whole fleet of Dragonite!

133
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,561
[screams]

134
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,569
Idiots! What are you doing?
Shoot them all down!

135
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,770
We can't!

136
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,907
Our cannons just can't reach
high enough for that, Commodore!

137
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,579
[roars]

138
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,649
Ryu!

139
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,090
Yeah. Don't worry.

140
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,927
I'll tell her for you. Promise.

141
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:40,079
[NELSON laughing]

142
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,456
Gum‐Gum...

00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,626
[LUFFY]
...Rocket!

144
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,161
Gonna borrow your neck!

145
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,202
[LUFFY]
Battle‐Axe!

146
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,971
[NELSON]
What's he doing?

147
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,195
[MARINE C]
Ship down!

148
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,614
[MARINE D]
Ah! What just happened?!

149
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,751
[MARINE E] The commodore's
ship's been destroyed.

150
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,794
Yep. Never fails.

151
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,697
Take out the leader and
the troops all run for cover.

152
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,765
I was hopin' these guys
would stay and fight.

153
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,867
We better get goin' ourselves.

154
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,609
They're circling. Wonder why.

155
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,378
[ZORO]
Hey! Let's go!

156
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,279
Right!

157
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,550
[MARINE F]
The chains! Unhook the chains!

158
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,452
[MARINE G]
You idiots! What are you doing?!

159
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,487
[MARINE H]
We're gonna crash!

160
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,394
Whoa! That was awesome!

161
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,730
[SANJI]
Nami, I've defended your honor!

162
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,598
[ZORO]
Get on board already!

163
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,399
[NAMI]
Where's Luffy?

164
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,000
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum!

165
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,769
Rocket!

166
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,003
'Scuse me!

167
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,575
[LUFFY laughing]

168
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:27,847
[LUFFY]
Yo!

169
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,014
Yo, yourself!

170
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,249
Do you have to slam
into the deck?!

171
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:34,854
You're gonna destroy the ship
if you're not more careful!

172
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,022
Grandpa!

173
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:40,926
An earthquake?

174
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,461
Again?!

175
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:46,132
[APIS] It's not fair.
Why did you have to die?

176
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:49,869
Now I can't keep
my promise to you.

177
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,771
I couldn't help you
realize your dream

178
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,106
of returning to
the Dragons' Nest.

179
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,810
[LUFFY] That's not true.
He got his wish.

180
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:09,488
[LUFFY] Can't you hear the
voices of the other dragons?

181
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,557
[APIS screams]

182
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,401
What's that?

183
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,737
A‐An earthquake!
The island's falling apart!

184
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,506
They're getting bigger!
What's going on?

185
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,509
Huh? Hey! Look!

186
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,412
[VILLAGER D]
The ocean! It's receding!

187
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,167
That's it. So that's
what it means!

188
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,902
What? What's "what" mean?

189
00:13:56,936 --> 00:14:00,739
[NAMI] The Dragons' Nest!
It really is here!

190
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,009
The name, Millennial Dragon.
Why didn't I see it before?

191
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,178
The reason they're called
"Millennial Dragons"

192
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,948
has nothing to do
with their lifespan!

193
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,187
[NAMI] It's because they
migrate to this island

194
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,556
only once every 1000 years!

195
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,725
By no means is that
an arbitrary schedule

196
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,594
they've decided
to stick to either!

197
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,229
They only visit every 1000 years

198
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,631
because that's the only time
the island surfaces!

199
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,766
That's why they
call it Lost Island.

200
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,105
Anyone who was around to
see it last time is long gone!

201
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,740
And here we are!

202
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,976
The next generation
to bear witness

203
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:41,146
to the rising of Lost Island
and the Dragons' Nest!

204
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,543
Is... that what I think it is?

205
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,544
Yeah.

206
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,680
Now I can see why Grandpa
Ryu was so anxious

207
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,715
to get back to this place!

208
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,385
It's here.

209
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,828
[SANJI]
Hey! Apis!

210
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,196
[USOPP]
Come back!

211
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,566
And she's off, but where to?

212
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,501
Grandpa Ryu.

213
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,704
He's finally home.

214
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,141
[APIS]
Grandpa Ryu!

215
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,915
Grandpa!

216
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,684
Please get up!

217
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,220
Grandpa Ryu!

218
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,027
How strange.

219
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,862
I mean, what are the
chances he would fall

220
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:40,065
directly on top of
the Dragons' Nest.

221
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,068
I hope that brought
him some peace.

222
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,236
I think so.

223
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,741
I heard him say his wish had
come true as he was sinking.

224
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,209
Strange place to put a nest.

225
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,212
I mean, what's with all these
weird looking rocks?

226
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,749
[SANJI] It's likely that
they're all made of Dragonite.

227
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,716
Notice the structure.

228
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,085
They look just like
dragons if you ask me.

229
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,720
Oh, yeah, right.

230
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,723
So what, the dragons carved
statues of themselves?

231
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,860
They're not statues.
Those are actual skeletons.

232
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:11,063
Fossilized Dragonite that's been
preserved on the ocean floor.

233
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,264
Ah, yeah.

234
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,600
[ZORO]
You still don't get it, do you?

235
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,935
Nope! Not a bit.

236
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,304
I've heard that when
elephants are about to die,

237
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,074
they instinctively travel
to a pre‐determined area,

238
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,876
like an elephant graveyard.

239
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:27,279
Maybe the same is true here.
It's a dragon graveyard.

240
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,781
[ZORO]
A graveyard?

241
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,082
[APIS]
It can't be.

242
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,950
Because Grandpa Ryu
promised me

243
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,787
that going back to his nest
would make him better!

244
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,123
It's not a graveyard! It's not!

245
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,292
Apis.

246
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:44,129
Listen to me. Grandpa
Ryu was lost and lonely.

247
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,130
Luffy?

248
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,067
He didn't have a friend.
Until you came along.

249
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,003
Then... everything changed
for the better.

250
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,011
And he wanted you to know

251
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,280
that for all the centuries
he's been alive,

252
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:05,150
this last year with you was the
happiest time he's ever known.

253
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,187
Wait.

254
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,322
Are you saying you can
understand the dragon?

255
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,091
It just came to me.

256
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,692
Are you making this up?

257
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,327
Nope. That's what he said!

258
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,997
[APIS]
You're a liar.

259
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,334
If this is the place you
always talked about,

260
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,703
then it should heal you
and make you strong again

261
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,371
like you promised me!

262
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,341
Talk to me!

263
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,176
You have to get better!

264
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:37,216
[APIS crying]

265
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:45,290
Ryu was telling you
the truth, Apis.

266
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,358
I'm serious.

267
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:49,027
He said that Millennial Dragons
return to the nest

268
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,331
every thousand years
and are reborn again.

269
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,299
[APIS]
Grandpa Ryu said all that?

270
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,868
[LUFFY]
Over there!

271
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,914
[gasps]

272
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,886
[APIS]
A baby Millennial Dragon?!

273
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,111
[NAMI]
I was wrong, Apis.

274
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,781
I don't think this is
a graveyard at all.

275
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,482
I think it's a place of renewal.

276
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,451
A special location
designed to bring

277
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,088
both old and new life together.

278
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,490
[APIS]
Thank you so much.

279
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,960
You all risked a lot
to bring Grandpa Ryu

280
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,928
back to the Dragons' Nest.

281
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,297
I always knew this place
was important to him,

282
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,500
but I never knew why until now.

283
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,103
Apis.

284
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,472
[APIS]
This is a place of miracles.

285
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,808
Now I understand
why my ancestors

286
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,777
went to so much trouble
to build the temple.

287
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,850
[APIS]
Thank you most of all, Luffy.

288
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,120
So let's go home!

289
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,322
Everyone's probably worried.

290
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,491
Won't they be surprised!

291
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,359
[chuckles]

292
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,660
Yeah!

293
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:07,299
All right! Let's get Apis back
home! It's time to celebrate!

294
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,468
‐‐[USOPP] Sounds good to me!
‐‐[LUFFY] I'm starving.

295
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,970
[LUFFY]
Hey, Sanji. Food. I need food.

296
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:12,838
[SANJI]
All right.

297
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,039
[LUFFY]
I want meat right off the bone!

298
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,175
[USOPP] We gotta have sprouts!
I want sautéed bean sprouts!

299
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,877
[SANJI] Hmm. Why does
that sound familiar?

300
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,445
[USOPP chuckles]

301
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,348
[USOPP] Man, these fossils are
unlike anything I ever imagined.

302
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,017
It's unbelievable that
they all used to be

303
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,518
living, breathing Dragons.

304
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:27,552
[NAMI]
But they were.

305
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,521
[SANJI] Even if the whole
Dragonite thing is true,

306
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,523
it can't be extracted
in their current state.

307
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,359
[USOPP] Then the Marine's whole
Elixir of Immortality plot?

308
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,395
[NAMI] Was nothing
but a silly dream.

309
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,197
These fossils are covered
with centuries of coral.

310
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,499
Even if we took 'em
back with us,

311
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,235
we'd never get a drop
of elixir from them.

312
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,538
[ZORO] Mean those Marines did
all that work for nothing.

313
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,383
[NELSON] Inept fools!
They think they've won!

314
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:01,887
As if I could be
dispatched so easily!

315
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,389
I must pay them back
for their effort!

316
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,926
But first things first. Ha!

317
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,361
Look at them all.

318
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,196
[NELSON laughing]

319
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,231
[NELSON]
A limitless supply of Dragonite

320
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,200
just waiting to be plucked!

321
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:18,236
[NELSON laughing]

322
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,104
[NELSON]
Hm?

323
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,505
[ERIC]
Move.

324
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,578
Eric, Look! A flock
of Millennial Dragons!

325
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:30,415
How fortuitous for
us both, my friend.

326
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,184
What say we seal
another deal?

327
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,452
How much money will it take‐‐?

328
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,188
[ERIC]
Get out of my way!

329
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,385

00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,691
[LUFFY]
He's persistent!

352
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:20,392
[ZORO]
I'll handle him.

353
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,527
[LUFFY]
No, I will! Get lost!

354
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,697
[NAMI] Lost Island. It's kinda
sad leaving it behind.

355
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,532
[LUFFY]
All right, set sail!

356
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,701
We're off to the
Grand Line at last!

357
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:30,702
[ZORO]
It's about time.

358
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,037
[USOPP]
There it is!

359
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,206
[LUFFY]
So that's the Red Line!

360
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,041
On the next One Piece!

361
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,077
"An Angry Showdown!
Cross the Red Line!"

362
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,680
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
