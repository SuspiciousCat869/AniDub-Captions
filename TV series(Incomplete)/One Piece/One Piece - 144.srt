00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,847
You fought ten of 'em?!

177
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,808
[NAMI]
Come on, you guys!

178
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,685
Tell me you at least tried to
find something down there

179
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,646
that we could actually use!

180
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,816
All you brought back was
a bunch of scattered junk!

181
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,111
There's not a single clue here
about how to get to sky island!

182
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,030
There wasn't
anything there, believe me.

183
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,031
We looked.

184
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,824
Yep, if there was something
else down there,

185
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,993
we would've found it.

186
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,714
The ship was in terrible shape,

187
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:18,052
all jacked up like it had maybe
been attacked and raided.

188
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,845
Or perhaps a mutiny
had broken out

189
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,847
and they all killed each
other in a violent struggle

190
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,183
for power and survival.

191
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,822
Look around, boys!

192
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,032
This is exactly why
we need more information!

193
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,034
Intelligence means the
difference between life

194
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,202
and death for this whole crew

195
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,829
and if we're going
to sail to sky island,

196
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,039
then we need
information to stay alive

197
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,875
or whatever happened to that
ship could happen to us too!

198
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,877
We didn't brave giant monsters
so you could bring back

199
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,172
a creepy octopus, some rusty
swords, and a broken dish!

200
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,757
This is all junk!

201
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,551
And you're all idiots!

202
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,972
What is that, Luffy?

203
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,890
[LUFFY]
Armor!

204
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,727
[crash]

205
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,603
Whoa! She crushed the armor!

206
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,355
Nami, you didn't even
notice the pretty sea shells

207
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,690
I brought you!

208
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,567
Cram your sea shells
in your shorts!

209
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,778
She's so beautiful
when she's angry.

210
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,905
You should still try
to keep your distance.

211
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,743
[ROBIN]
Bad day, huh?

212
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,078
[NAMI] It's only going to get
worse working with these guys.

213
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,789
We'll never figure out how
that ship sailed to the sky.

214
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,083
I'm gonna snap on
them any second.

215
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,877
[ROBIN]
Maybe this'll help.

216
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,087
Eternal Pose?

217
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,088
But how?

218
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,841
Oh, I took it off that
salvager's ship earlier.

219
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,760
Just in case.

220
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,221
[NAMI laughs]

221
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,224
You're the only one
I can depend on!

222
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:52,021
[LUFFY] All right, who's up
for an octopus dinner tonight?

223
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,733
That boy has got
to learn to relax.

224
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,614
[NAMI]
Jaya?

225
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,616
This must have
been their home port.

226
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,076
Jaya? Is that where
we're going next?

227
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,246
That would be your
decision, Captain!

228
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,293
All hands, on deck!

229
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,797
Set our course to Jaya!

230
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,052
So, uh, any of you know
which direction that might be?

231
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,136
[NAMI]
Starboard.

232
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,763
[LUFFY]
You heard her, Chopper!

233
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,430
[CHOPPER]
Right!

234
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,058
[LUFFY]
Onward to Jaya!

235
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:30,518
[USOPP]
Hmm?

236
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,978
Now hold up just a minute.

237
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,898
If we head off to this Jaya
place that's so important,

238
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,652
won't the Log Pose's needle
change its position again?

239
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,279
[USOPP]
'Cause if that happens,

240
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,240
we won't know which
direction sky island is.

241
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,115
What?

242
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,159
All hands, full stop!

243
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,161
Wanna tell me why you're
messing with my head Nami?

244
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,329
I'm not.

245
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,706
You're the genius who
decided we should go to Jaya.

246
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,791
Oh yeah, that's right.

247
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,668
Well, I didn't know
it was gonna ruin our plans

248
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,836
to get to this Skypiea.

249
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,129
It's not my fault you have
the memory of a goldfish.

250
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,258
Think, the Log Pose has always
worked that way, hasn't it?

251
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,676
Yeah, I guess so.

252
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,301
Hey!

253
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,261
Listen up!

254
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,512
I have an important
announcement to make!

255
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,808
Seeing as I'm the captain, I say
we set our course for Skypiea!

256
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,142
How do you propose we get there?

257
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,395
We're gonna have to
ask for some directions.

258
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,689
Maybe someone in
Jaya will know the way.

259
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,148
Very well, Jaya it is.

260
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,360
Right! On to Jaya!

261
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,696
You already said that!

262
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,155
I doubt that the
needle would change

263
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,032
as soon as we get there.

264
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,450
So why don't we pull into port

265
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,036
and then leave before it
has a chance to adjust?

266
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:31,704
Sounds good to me.

267
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,455
If we're lucky, it'll work.

268
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,500
That sounds like a plan to us.

269
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,752
[LUFFY]
Full sail to Jaya, people!

270
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,171
And this time it's for real!

271
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,966
[NAMI] Now stop stuffing
your faces and get to work!

272
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,135
[CHOPPER] I wonder
what this Jaya place is like.

273
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,428
I hope it's relaxing.

274
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,429
[SANJI]
Nami my sweet!

275
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,889
Robin my dear!

276
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,223
Dinner is served.

277
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,474
This afternoon
you will be dining

278
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:56,353
on fresh gourmet octopus
and seaweed stew!

279
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,442
[MASIRA]
Great!

280
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,444
Who do they think they
are leaving me out here?

281
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,238
Like they didn't have enough
room on their ship or something.

282
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,448
Please.

283
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,252
[MOHJI]
Captain. Captain!

284
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,296
[BUGGY]
What?!

285
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,925
[MOHJI]
Is... Is this really the place?

286
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,470
The legendary cave place where
Captain John hid his treasure.

287
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:34,058
The treasure he killed
so many innocents to get?

288
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,976
Yes. That's right.

289
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,102
Now look alive boys,

290
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,064
the treasure is near but
so is unspeakable danger.

291
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,191
If you let your guard
down even for a second,

292
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,026
then death will creep on you.

293
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,820
There's no telling what
kind of monsters will appear

294
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:50,824
or what vicious booby traps
await to kill us all.

295
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,161
[BOSS]
C'mon, men!

296
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,122
Another fine day of
carving out tunnels awaits us!

297
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,123
[WORKERS]
Right‐O, Boss!

298
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,458
[laughs]

299
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,920
Oh. You must be the new
guys they sent down.

300
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,090
[chuckles] Nothing like working
up a sweat, right, Boss?

301
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,092
All a man really needs
is a pick axe in his hand

302
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,468
and a tunnel to dig!

303
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,886
You can say that again!

304
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,471
A hard days work
is a wonderful thing!

305
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,556
And because of our good
old‐fashioned elbow grease,

306
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,809
everyone who comes
to this tunnel will smile!

307
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,310
[laughs]
It's liberating!

308
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,979
You know,
after all this hard labor,

309
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,898
we outta head to the
Ol' Bilge Barge for a‐‐

310
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,861
How dare you make me
work like one of your lackies!

311
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,668
Not one single piece of treasure
on that whole rotten island.

312
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,295
You know, you should really
watch what you say Mohji!

313
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,048
If there's one thing the
captain hates, it's being wrong.

314
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,092
I mean, can't you see
how red he's gotten

315
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,468
with all the embarrassment?

316
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,054
Who's nose is a
big red embarrassment?

317
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,809
I hate to interrupt.

318
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,686
But we do not
have time for this.

319
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,522
What are we going to
do about those Straw Hats?

320
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,691
They are quickly becoming
the new favorite pirates

321
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,067
in the Grand Line.

322
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,318
I have a plan of course.

323
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,153
You moron!

324
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,030
We let 'em go
on their merry way.

325
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,449
[MOHJI]
What? Why?

326
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,576
Well, you see, before
an evil witch feasts

327
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,828
upon the flesh of children
the first thing the she does

328
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,663
is makes sure to fatten them up.

329
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,457
Understand me?

330
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,500
Idiots.

331
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,543
This is why I'm Captain.

332
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,421
See, the bigger the bounty
gets on the Straw Hats‐‐

333
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,047
I see!

334
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:28,881
You're a genius, Captain!

335
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,632
That way when
you take them down,

336
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,177
the bounty on your
head will get even higher.

337
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,262
[cheering]

338
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,598
[laughs]

339
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,058
Yes! Exactly!

340
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,559
[CABAJI]
You're amazing, Captain!

341
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,728
Shall we throw a party
in honor of your brilliance?

342
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,438
[BUGGY]
Oh, why not?

343
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,398
[laughs]

344
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,109
[ALVIDA] Is this really
the time to be throwing a party?

345
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,319
After all, how can you plan on

346
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,737
beating Luffy
and the Straw Hat's

347
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,156
when you haven't the faintest
idea of where they are?

348
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,283
Don't be such a
party pooper, Alvida.

349
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,160
We'll find Luffy
when we find him.

350
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,578
Okay?

351
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,246
[ACE]
If you're looking for Luffy,

352
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,248
I can tell you where he is.

353
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,374
Ha! You see?

354
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,543
This guy over here is going
to tell us where he is.

355
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,337
Problem solved!

356
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,673
Hey! Hold on! Who are you?

357
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,925
[ACE]
Sorry for crashing your party,

358
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:16,303
but I simply couldn't resist the
delicious aromas of your feast.

359
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,138
My name is Portgas D. Ace.

360
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,556
But you can call me Ace.

361
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,558
Oh, no need to be so formal.

362
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,852
Nice to meet you too!

363
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,816
I mean, what are you
doing here, you idiot?!

364
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,859
I couldn't care less
about what your name is,

365
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,611
Mr. Portgas D. Ace!

366
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,113
Uh, Captain.

367
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,156
Captain, this guy is...

368
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,741
He's the Fire Fist.

369
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,451
Fire Fist Ace!

370
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,496
Captain of the Whitebeard
Pirates Second Unit!

371
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,706
Not Whitebeard's...?!

372
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,458
Ah! So you know the old man?

373
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,626
What a nice‐‐

374
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,672
He fell asleep?

375
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,799
[BUGGY]
No, I won't!

376
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,758
Why not?

377
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,968
Captain, this could
be our only chance.

378
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:59,179
If we can take out Fire Fist
Ace of the Whitebeard Pirates,

379
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,722
we'll be famous!

380
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,599
I said no!

381
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,520
Remember this, men,
and remember it good.

382
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,398
This is the most important
lesson you'll ever learn:

383
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,775
Don't mess with
the Whitebeard Pirates.

384
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,651
Ever!

385
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,237
Whitebeard is a
killer born and bred.

386
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,822
The only man who could go

387
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,200
toe‐to‐toe with Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates.

388
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,828
He is without a doubt
the strongest pirate alive

389
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,996
and the person closest

390
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:27,666
to obtaining the greatest
treasure of all, One Piece!

391
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,669
In other words, don't cross him!

392
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:34,214
Even if we were able to kill
Fire Fist Ace while he sleeps,

393
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,341
Whitebeard would avenge
the murder of one of his own

394
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,677
with the fury
of a thunderstrorm!

395
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,180
How is it that you know so much?

396
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,222
Pray tell.

397
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,350
Well, if you insist.

398
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,978
It was on the Grand Line.

399
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,229
Years ago.

400
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,608
I met that man face to face, and
I've never been the same since.

401
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,775
[ACE snorts]

402
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,236
Sorry about that.
I must've dozed off.

403
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,405
What the? He's awake?

404
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,201
Hey, hey!
Why the long faces, everyone?

405
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,535
I thought this was a party?

406
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,119
Am I right?

407
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,537
Oh, yeah, you're right.

408
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,415
Men, commence having fun again!

409
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,545
Ace, you sure know how
to have a good time!

410
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,838
[ACE]
Whoa! You guys got a lion?

411
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,383
Be a good kitty and jump through
that flaming hoop on two legs.

412
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,551
[MOHJI]
C'mon, Rich!

413
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,886
Show him your stuff!

414
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,818
[PIRATES]
Boss! Boss!

415
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,612
[PIRATE B]
Where could he be?

416
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,947
[PIRATES]
Boss! Where'd you go?!

417
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,823
[MASIRA]
I'm over here!

418
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,492
C'mon! Pick me up!

419
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,910
[PIRATE B]
We're never gonna find him!

420
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,828
Better try looking
somewhere else!

421
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,248
[MASIRA]
Open your eyes, boy!

422
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,416
Get back here, you idiots!

423
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,793
Don't leave!

424
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,265
[CHOPPER] I keep
wondering what Jaya's like.

425
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,433
I've heard it's
called the land of meat.

426
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,643
You don't know that Luffy.

427
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,769
You just wish it were true

428
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,772
'cause we've been eating
the same old junk for days.

429
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,607
[SANJI] If you don't like it,
then don't eat it!

430
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,442
This was for
Robin and Nami anyway!

431
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,988
[LUFFY] They said they
wouldn't eat it so give it back!

432
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,449
[LUFFY, USOPP, CHOPPER]
Give us back our food!

433
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,909
[SANJI]
Don't think so!

434
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,541
[ZORO]
I can't even imagine it.

435
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,919
Could there really be
an island in the sky?

436
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,548
[ROBIN] We've experienced enough
to know the answer by now.

437
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,841
See, no matter how strange

438
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,343
or illogical something
may seem to us.

439
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:47,055
Out here, the sea's logic
can make anything possible.

440
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:58,442
[NAMI] The key to going
to sky island is on Jaya.

441
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:06,700
<i>♪Now, I look up and see,</i>

[NAMI]
This town looks rough.

455
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,899
[ZORO]
You could get hurt here.

456
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,734
[LUFFY]
It's an island of springs!

457
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,069
[NAMI]
Stop being weird!

458
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,196
[ZORO] Seems like a
place for pirates to gather!

459
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,739
[LUFFY]
Ooh! Sounds fun!

460
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,907
[NAMI]
Stay focused!

461
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,743
We came to get information
on sky island or Skypiea,

462
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,619
whatever you call it!

463
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,788
So don't you dare
cause any trouble!

464
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,415
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

465
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,584
"Quit Dreaming! Mock Town,
the Town Of Ridicule!"

466
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,087
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
