1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,158
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:42,095
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

39
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:45,331
and everything else
the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:50,336
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,505
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

42
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,606
You can have it!

43
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,210
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

44
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,946
Now you just have to find it!

45
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:03,383
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

46
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,352
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

47
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,622
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

48
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,527
[NARRATOR]
While on the ice-covered sea

49
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,362
known as the Frozen Highway,

50
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,264
the separated members
of the Straw Hat crew

51
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,633
face off against a
group of bounty hunters

52
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,602
known as the Accino Family.

53
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,671
[SALCHOW] Here goes!

54
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,074
[SALCHOW, ARBELL]
Love Throw!

55
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,511
A gorgeous rocket of
beauty soaring into my arms!

56
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,179
Not what I expected!

57
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,418
[LIL] Today's our
Papa's big birthday party.

58
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,053
That's why everyone's
out trying to get him

59
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,088
the best present they can!

60
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,457
[ROBIN]
So the flag's his present?

61
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,159
No. Bad guess.

62
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,694
[LIL] These are the presents.

63
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,563
There's an 80 million
bounty on your head.

64
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,497
Isn't there?

65
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,132
[NARRATOR]
With a little help from Puzzle,

66
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,734
Luffy and the others
managed to capture

67
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,437
the eldest son of the
Accino Family, Brindo.

68
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,471
Dammit!

69
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,009
No!

70
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,155
[coughing]

71
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,123
[CHOPPER] Luffy!

72
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,526
[BRINDO] And as for the
rest of you pirate scum,

73
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,996
your time is coming, too!

74
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,733
[JIRO] Captain Puzzle!

75
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,800
[SUTTON] Puzzle!

76
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,339
They still haven't caught them?

77
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,141
You got their
flag though, right?

78
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,043
[CAMPACINO]
It'll be here soon, Papa.

79
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,511
You just relax.

80
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,715
What the hell's this
place 'sposed to be?

81
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,317
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, Nami and Franky

82
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,487
fought against the Accino
family's third son, Hockera.

83
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,490
They were defeated and captured.

84
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,424
--Damn it, let us out!
--Let us out of here,

85
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,126
--Damn it, let us out!
--you stupid jerk!

86
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,631
[SALCHOW] Get back here,
you long-nosed bastard!

87
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,601
[USOPP yelling]

88
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,102
Usopp! What's wrong with you?

89
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,671
How could you shoot
a lady like that?!

90
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,572
Are you kidding?
She was trying to kill us!

91
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:10,243
[SALCHOW] How dare you do that
to my sweet honey, Arbell?

92
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,446
[SALCHOW]
Get back here!

93
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,082
I can't just
leave her like that!

94
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,283
[SALCHOW]
Take this!

95
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,656
Gunpowder Star!

96
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,192
[USOPP] Look out!

97
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,864
Ow! My head is
killing me! I mean...

98
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:36,202
Hahahahaha! Operation Usopp
Headbutt Attack was a success!

99
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,471
Mission complete!

100
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,773
[SANJI] Dearest Arbell,
are you all right?

101
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,475
Salchow...

102
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,411
Lemme go!

103
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,783
[LUFFY] Hot Full Throttle!

104
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,253
The Twins' Magnetic
Power Drawing Near!

105
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,758
[sneezes]

106
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,426
So cold!

107
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,562
Hey! You were the one
who saved me, right?

108
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,796
Thanks a lot!

109
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,300
[CHOPPER] How is it? Any pain?

110
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,402
A little,
but I think I'm okay.

111
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,474
You!

112
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,743
How dare you try to turn us
into your own personal slaves!

113
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,679
Too bad. You underestimated
the Phoenix Pirates.

114
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,414
It's payback time!

115
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,750
Not so fast.

116
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,585
Don't forget about my brothers.

117
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:28,521
They'll hunt you down
if anything happens to me.

118
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,223
Bring 'em on!

119
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,693
Your days of telling us
what to do are over!

120
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,496
That smart mouth's gonna
get you in trouble, kid.

121
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,730
Whatever!

122
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,866
I swear, if you think you can
still push us around, then--

123
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,167
[PUZZLE] Enough!

124
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,702
[JIRO] Captain Puzzle!

125
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,871
You've all got the wrong idea.

126
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,273
I didn't capture him so that
we could keep him locked up here

127
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,307
as our prisoner.

128
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,342
[GUYLE] What?

129
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:55,148
If possible, I'd like
to make a deal with you.

130
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,886
A deal, huh?

131
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,087
[PUZZLE] Yeah.

132
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,424
I'd like you to let my crew
leave this place peacefully.

133
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,795
In exchange,
I'll surrender myself.

134
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,265
What? No, Captain Puzzle!
You can't!

135
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,800
What the hell
are you trying to do?

136
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,602
[laughing]

137
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,205
Well, well!
You're not as dumb as I thought!

138
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,406
Would you think about this?

139
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,376
If you leave, what's gonna
happen to the Phoenix Pirates?

140
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,745
Stop it, Jiro.

141
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,547
The Captain has spoken.

142
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,915
He's made up his mind.

143
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,582
But--!

144
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,650
[PUZZLE] Jiro.

145
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,486
Listen to me.

146
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,757
You little rat!

147
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,460
Do you really think
you can deceive me?

148
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,528
Well, you'll pay for trying!

149
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,232
[coughing]

150
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,835
Stansen!

151
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,539
[JIRO] Captain!

152
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,807
Why're you standing here?

153
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,909
Hurry up and beat
the crap out of that guy!

154
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,344
C'mon, captain, please!

155
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,613
Ohohohoho!

156
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,384
Captain!
What's wrong with you?

157
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,019
You aren't acting
like yourself at all!

158
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:07,820
C'mon!

159
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:11,557
Help him!
Do something, captain!

160
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,493
Damn it!

161
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,697
We're not pirates anymore.
It doesn't matter, okay?

162
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,865
How can you say that?

163
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,600
[laughing]

164
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,502
You're a smart
captain after all.

165
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,336
All right, then.

166
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,470
In exchange for you
and your bounty,

167
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,507
I promise the rest of
these guys will be free to go.

168
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,374
You can't!

169
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,777
I won't let you!
I'm a Phoenix Pirate!

170
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,012
Hold it!

171
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,516
Just watch!

172
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,950
I'll take care of him!

173
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,853
Jiro. Stop.
That's enough. It's over.

174
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,556
Ohohohoho!
Come on! Just try it!

175
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:44,824
If you even touch me,

176
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,927
your entire pathetic
crew will be doomed!

177
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,061
You bastard!

178
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,464
Ohoho! Ohoho!

179
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,034
What are you doing?

180
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,303
Whoa! You heard
what I said, boy!

181
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,639
If you even think about hurting
me, this entire crew will--

182
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,307
Where's our flag?

183
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,441
Easy, Luffy.

184
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,709
Your flag?

185
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,045
Maybe you haven't noticed, but
this crew is in no position to--

186
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,080
This has nothing
to do with them.

187
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,583
Gimme back my flag
before I beat it out of you.

188
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,817
Even if, on a whim,

189
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,953
I felt like giving you back
your flag, it doesn't matter.

190
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:14,787
It's not here.

191
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,789
[LUFFY]
Take us to where it is. Now.

192
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,024
Hey! Just calm down!

193
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,993
The guide will be
here shortly, all right?

194
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:21,994
[BRINDO] Once he's here,

195
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,564
we'll be led deep
inside the Frozen Highway

196
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,633
until we reach my family's
stronghold: Lovely Land.

197
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,603
And the moment you and this
joke of a crew set foot there,

198
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,438
all of you will be done for.

199
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,740
It's just a matter of time.

200
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,847
[ACCINO] What's taking
that flag so long?

201
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,951
Answer me, Campacino!

202
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,018
Papa!

203
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,019
Take it easy!

204
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,322
Lil's flying fish will
deliver it any minute!

205
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,790
No need to worry!

206
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,391
And what of
my birthday party?

207
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,993
When will that happen?

208
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,228
[CAMPACINO] Just as soon
as the others return.

209
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,230
Campacino!

210
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,766
How long are you
gonna keep me waiting?

211
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,235
Papa! There's no
need to be angry!

212
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,879
Just a little further,
then we'll be home.

213
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,082
So as of right now...

214
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:20,386
This person and this person
are also headed to your house?

215
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,654
[LIL] Yep!

216
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:25,324
My brother Hockera should arrive
there with them at any minute.

217
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,158
Huh...

218
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,399
Ke ke! Papa is
going to be so happy!

219
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,935
Come on!

220
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,137
Can't you do something
to warm it up in here?

221
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,872
What exactly do
you expect me to do?

222
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,440
The controls are frozen solid.

223
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,708
Though if you'd like,

224
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,945
I suppose a little taste of my
Fresh Fire might do in a pinch.

225
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,547
Are you insane?

226
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,950
You'll burn me and
everything else to a crisp!

227
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,284
[FRANKY]
You got any better ideas?

228
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,119
[NAMI]
Come up with something

229
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,987
that doesn't
involve me in danger!

230
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,455
[FRANKY]
Holy crap, are you demanding!

231
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,225
[NAMI] Not wanting to
die is not "demanding"!

232
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,530
Dammit! Are these
guys annoying or what?

233
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:05,398
Oh, Arbell.

234
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,867
What could you possibly
see in that guy?

235
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,335
You clowns might've
gotten lucky once,

236
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,537
but you'd be fools to
think we'd lose that easily!

237
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,040
Salchow, let's show
them something special.

238
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,175
How about our Supreme Attack?

239
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,211
Crap! They're about to
hit us with something big!

240
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,312
Good.

241
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,548
That'll be the perfect
chance to show off my skills

242
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,050
in front of Arbell.

243
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,489
[USOPP] I don't like
the looks of this!

244
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,192
They're spinning even faster
than they were last time!

245
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,927
Once I do,
she'll be so impressed,

246
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,328
she'll dump that jerk for me.

247
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,964
Fine. Whatever prevents
them from killing us.

248
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,399
It's up to you!

249
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,567
That's fast enough!

250
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,302
Are you ready, Arbell?

251
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:47,006
Yes, Salchow!

252
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,342
[SALCHOW, ARBELL] High Jump
Great Rotation Ultra Love Throw!

253
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,287
[SANJI] Dammit! It's the ice!

254
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,521
It's too slippery!

255
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,756
Sanji...

256
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,126
If those two hit me again, I
think it'll be the death of me.

257
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,361
Come on!
You're always exaggerating.

258
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,397
I've got bruises
and I'm covered in blood!

259
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,365
Is that an exaggeration?

260
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,502
Salchow! This is the best!

261
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,670
Agreed, Arbell!

262
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,438
Let's do it one more time!

263
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,306
Right!

264
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,173
Usopp.

265
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,909
Let's show them
our cooperative attack.

266
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,377
So you figured out a plan?

267
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,480
Sure! I'm happy to help!

268
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,414
What the--?

269
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,915
How is this supposed to help?

270
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,617
It keeps me from slipping.

271
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,594
[SANJI] Collier Frit!

272
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,066
[SANJI] Dearest Arbell!

273
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,068
Seems fate's given us
a second chance.

274
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,469
So what do you say?

275
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,339
Can it, you womanizing jerk!

276
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,141
Have your lover's
quarrel somewhere else!

277
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,109
Get off me!

278
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,644
[ARBELL]
Salchow! Can you hear me?

279
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,179
Say something!

280
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,313
--Oh! Arbell!

281
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,948
--[USOPP laughing]
--Oh! Arbell!

282
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,283
Now you get it!

283
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,051
Whatever attack you throw at us

284
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,288
will be rendered meaningless
against our boundless strength!

285
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,258
Sanji! Get up already!
You're gonna make us look bad!

286
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,527
If you'd like to surrender,
now is the time.

287
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,264
That last attack only revealed
ten percent of my true power!

288
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,566
[ARBELL and SALCHOW chuckling]

289
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,334
[ARBELL] Oh, how cute,
you probably think

290
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,171
we've been skating in circles
this whole time just for fun.

291
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,573
[USOPP] Eh?
Wait, what? What do you mean?

292
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,041
[SALCHOW, ARBELL]
Funny you should ask.

293
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,976
This is what we mean!

294
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,482
[USOPP screaming]

295
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,053
[USOPP] It's freezing!

296
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,322
[ARBELL]
I think you should surrender!

297
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,223
[USOPP] Never!

298
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,357
Now don't be like that.

299
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,726
If you behave, and come along
quietly, we'll save you.

300
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,061
What do you say?

301
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,696
[USOPP] Hey... What's that?

302
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,499
[screaming]

303
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,569
If you two don't give up soon,
you're gonna freeze to death.

304
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,603
You shut up!

305
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,238
Hey! Snap out of it!

306
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,274
Usopp, I--I think I
feel like sleeping right now.

307
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,442
Are you kidding me?

308
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,378
We're in danger!
We're gonna die!

309
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,180
[USOPP]
Okay! Okay! I'm sorry!

310
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,182
I surrender!
Please, save me!

311
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,286
Salchow! Look!

312
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,588
I think I caught one!

313
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,590
[SALCHOW] I did too, Arbell!

314
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,294
[USOPP] Dammit. So cold.

315
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,329
[kissing noise]

316
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:31,604
Where is he?

317
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,106
I thought there
was a guide coming.

318
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,309
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL]
Click.

319
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,478
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL RINGING]

320
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,247
--[JIRO] Huh?
--[BRINDO] There. Finally.

321
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,549
Hey, kid, there's a
transponder snail in my pocket.

322
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,252
Pull it out and answer it.

323
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,289
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL RINGING]

324
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,624
[CAMPACINO]
Brindo, what's wrong?

325
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,193
Where are you?
Where are the presents?

326
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,828
Papa's getting angry.

327
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,229
[CAMPACINO] Did you hear me?

328
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,165
What's going on? Say something.

329
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,835
Brindo has been taken
prisoner by the Phoenix Pirates!

330
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:06,105
If you try anything stupid,
he'll be executed!

331
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,207
No! Jiro, wait!

332
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,478
[laughing]

333
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,280
Oh, boy! Now you've done it!

334
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,247
Huh?

335
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,149
My brother's coming.

336
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,250
[LUFFY] Your brother?

337
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,418
[laughing]

338
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,287
[BRINDO]
Looks like the deal's off!

339
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,823
Just you wait. Our powers
are going to crush you!

340
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,641
[laughing]

341
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,876
What do you mean "your powers"?

342
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,611
What are you gonna do?

343
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:51,617
What's happening?

344
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,819
I'm not gonna let you do
anything weird, got it?

345
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,422
Whoa! Cool!
How'd you make yourself shiny?

346
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,458
Wow! Awesome!

347
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,793
This is just the beginning.

00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,594
[laughing]

349
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,643
What's that?

00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,682

351
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,151
Wait... He was
chained up, wasn't he?

352
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,453
How'd he escape?

353
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,620
No way!

354
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,691

00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,361
Now there's two of him?

357
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,929
[CAMPACINO]
How dare you try to kidnap

358
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,431
my adorable little brother.

359
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,268
My brother!

360
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,903
Brother!

361
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,641
It's been quite
some time since...

362
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,745
...we used our
Combination Play!

363
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:53,846
That's cool!

364
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,148
How'd you do that glowy stuff?

365
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,184
We're merely using
a bit of magnetism.

366
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,519
Observe.

367
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,689
We can cover a greater
range by separating.

368
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,193
And then we can
return together instantly

369
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,429
for close-range assaults.

370
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,766
It's the magnetic power that
links our brotherhood together!

371
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,237
That's how we show our...

372
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,839
...brotherly love!

373
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,809
Cool! Did you two eat
a Devil Fruit or something?

374
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,411
[CAMPACINO chuckling]

375
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,846
Our power doesn't come
from anything like that.

376
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,648
We have these abilities...

377
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,483
--...because we are twins!
--...because we are twins!

378
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,586
Haha! Twins are awesome!

379
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,989
That doesn't explain it!
It's still weird!

380
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,792
Brindo, which ones
are today's targets?

381
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:40,759
Well...

382
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,495
First we have
Captain Puzzle, the Phoenix,

383
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,432
with a bounty of
100 million Berries.

384
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,635
Next, we have Straw Hat Luffy,

385
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,371
with a bounty of
300 million Berries.

386
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,807
[CAMPACINO] Really! That guy?

387
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,942
[BRINDO] And this is their
cotton candy-loving pet,

388
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,378
Chopper, with a
bounty of 50 Berries.

389
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,179
[CHOPPER]
50?

390
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,414
50 Berries?
Really? Why bother?

391
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,816
I know, right?
It's almost nothing.

392
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,250
[CHOPPER] Don't gimme that crap!

393
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,586
I object to 50 Berries!

394
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,654
Never mind.

395
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,290
Now, let's see if you can
think of a way to escape

396
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,991
from our Combination Play!

397
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,432
--[BRINDO] Straw Hat!
--[LUFFY] Hm?

398
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,401
Look over here!

399
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,703
[CHOPPER]
Luffy, be careful! Behind you!

400
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,438
Behind me?

401
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,307
[BRINDO] Repulsion Pass!

402
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:31,977
[chuckling]

403
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,679
Right into the sea!

404
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,482
These punks are no
match for our brotherhood!

405
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,816
Luffy!

406
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,286
[LUFFY] Gum-Gum... Rocket!

407
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,456
Brother, no!

408
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,891
Nice one!

409
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:46,925
Wow!

410
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,997
You'll pay for that.

411
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,800
Haha! Ready to give up?

412
00:18:58,228 --> 00:19:00,264
[ACCINO] Campacino!

413
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:01,932
Who said that?

414
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,170
Hello? Is somebody in here?

415
00:19:06,203 --> 00:19:08,071
[ACCINO] How much longer
do I have to wait?

416
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,607
Where's my party?
Where's my flag?

417
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:13,243
Ugh. It's hot.
What is this place?

418
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:16,680
[ZORO] Who are you?

419
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:19,683
My mistake--thought you
were my boy, Campacino.

420
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:24,521
I was saving this for
the party, but want some?

421
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:27,324
All right. Sure.

422
00:19:27,357 --> 00:19:29,059
[ACCINO] Make yourself at home.

423
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:30,394
Will do.

424
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:33,530
I'm waiting for my
family to get back here

425
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:34,698
for my birthday party.

426
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:37,034
And now, the party
organizer stepped out

427
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:38,468
and hasn't returned yet, either.

428
00:19:38,502 --> 00:19:40,003
It's kind of annoying.

429
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:41,171
Well, what a coincidence.

430
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:42,606
Everyone in my crew stepped out,

431
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,541
and I can't seem
to find them anywhere.

432
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:46,276
I've been looking for hours.

433
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,579
We're in the same situation.

434
00:19:48,612 --> 00:19:50,380
Seems so. Thanks!

435
00:19:50,414 --> 00:19:52,716
I wish I knew where those
nitwits wandered off to.

436
00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:53,817
I bet.

437
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,020
I'm also curious as to
where you wandered in from.

438
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:02,192
[LUFFY] Gum-Gum... Bell!

439
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:06,230
Doctor!

440
00:20:06,263 --> 00:20:07,397
Don't worry, I'm fine.

441
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:08,465
[LUFFY] Listen up, you two.

442
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,033
If you don't give us
back our flag,

443
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,568
we'll beat you up for real!

444
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:14,504
Brindo. Papa is getting
angrier and angrier.

445
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:16,306
We need to end this now.

446
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,508
Let's use his Devil
Fruit powers against him.

447
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,444
Throw him in the sea.
That should stop him.

448
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:22,512
Enough! Gum-Gum...

449
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:26,783
...Gatling!

450
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:28,285
[BRINDO] Combine!

451
00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:36,326
[LUFFY screaming]

452
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,427
Luffy!

453
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:38,762
Captain!

454
00:20:38,795 --> 00:20:40,597
I can't! He's too far!

455
00:20:40,631 --> 00:20:42,232
Like I'd fall!

456
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:48,338
[BRINDO, CAMPACINO]
Magnetic Repulsion Pass!

457
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:57,447
Whew! That was close!

458
00:20:59,316 --> 00:21:01,051
Listen, Straw Hat.

459
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:02,119
Just give up already.

460
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:04,087
It's impossible
to escape from us!

461
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:07,257
So? I'm not gonna escape--
I'm gonna beat you up!

462
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,661
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum... Twin Pistol!

463
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:12,162
--Repulsion!
--Repulsion!

464
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,805
I'm on my way, Luffy!

465
00:21:21,838 --> 00:21:23,607
[loud crashing noise]

466
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,108
What's going on?

467
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,515
Jiro! Be careful!

468
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:36,286
[CHOPPER] Jiro!

469
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:45,228
Are you all right?

470
00:21:45,796 --> 00:21:47,631
Yes. Thanks, Captain.

471
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,600
Quick!
Turn the ship around now!

472
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:52,135
We gotta go back for Luffy!

473
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:53,036
But that's impossible.

474
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,205
We're on the
Frozen Highway, remember?

475
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:56,640
It won't let us turn.

476
00:21:57,674 --> 00:21:59,409
Luffy...

477
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,144
[ACCINO laughing]

478
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:02,512
Forget about them.

479
00:22:02,546 --> 00:22:04,348
They forgot about you, right?

480
00:22:06,183 --> 00:22:07,384
Nah, these things happen.

481
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,619
They're probably just screwing
around in the ice somewhere.

482
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:11,655
We'll find each other
soon enough.

483
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,328
Ah! You noticed!

484
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:20,864
My collection I'm so proud of.
What do you think?

485
00:22:20,897 --> 00:22:21,898
[ZORO] Collection?

486
00:22:21,932 --> 00:22:22,833
[ACCINO] That's right!

487
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:25,235
These are the pirates
we've hunted down.

488
00:22:25,268 --> 00:22:27,337
Quite impressive, yes?

489
00:22:28,872 --> 00:22:31,441
That's an annoying
little hobby you have there.

490
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,177
Come on!
Don't say such things.

491
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,582
Finally! It's here.

492
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:44,121
Maybe if you see this one, we'll
understand each other better.

493
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:48,558
[ACCINO] The flag of the
notorious Straw Hat Pirates,

494
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:51,461
whose collective bounty
is more than 600 million.

495
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,462
Isn't that right...

496
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:57,734
...Mr. 120 million Berry
bounty, Roronoa Zoro?

497
00:22:57,768 --> 00:22:58,769
[ZORO] You!

498
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:04,474
What the hell are you doing
with our flag, you bastard?

499
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:08,245
This particular one may
be the prize of my collection.

500
00:23:18,655 --> 00:23:20,323
[NAMI] It's even colder here!

501
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,793
You were planning on imprisoning
us all along, weren't you?

502
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:24,628
[USOPP]
Even the walls are made of ice!

503
00:23:24,661 --> 00:23:27,330
But all this cold is
making me kind of sleepy.

504
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,398
[NAMI] No sleeping!

505
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:30,367
If you do,
you'll freeze to death!

506
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,369
[USOPP] Where the hell
are Robin and Zoro, anyway?

507
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:33,603
Help us!

508
00:23:33,637 --> 00:23:35,405
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

509
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,274
Mansion of Great Chaos!

510
00:23:37,307 --> 00:23:39,776
The Enraged Don
and the Captured Crew!

511
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,512
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
