1
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,226
You jerk.

2
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,096
You've landed us in
a real mess, Luffy.

3
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,364
What's the big deal?

4
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,099
All we've gotta do is win.

5
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,701
[FOXY CREW A]
You're forgetting something.

6
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,636
You gotta fill out
your team roster.

7
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,805
Our party organizer needs it.

8
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,241
You each get to
participate twice.

9
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,742
And once you've
picked your lineup,

10
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,377
it's set in stone.

11
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,646
It's got the events
listed: a race,

12
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,815
ball game, and
a team contest.

13
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:28,882
What's that say?

14
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,685
Well, looks like we can
all take part in the race.

15
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,420
Three for the ball game

16
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,656
and then five of us
for the team contest.

17
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,491
Cool. You can go ahead

18
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,393
and sign me up for all three.

19
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,628
No, can't do that.

20
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,631
The rules say that
two is the limit.

21
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,499
[USOPP]
We can't lose this thing.

22
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,569
I just know they're gonna
take Captain Usopp if we do.

23
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,503
[NAMI]
No, they aren't.

24
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,673
They're gonna take me.
I'm the cute one.

25
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,375
And it's time

26
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,377
to announce the
rosters each team

27
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,279
has chosen to represent
them in today's events.

28
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:01,615
First up. We've got
the Straw Hat pirates!

29
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,317
Participating in round one,

30
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,720
the Donut Race is the
entire Straw Hat crew!

31
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,289
I ever tell you
I got a disease

32
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,057
that prevents me from racing?

33
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,792
I don't wanna do this
stupid race either,

34
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,394
so just man up!

35
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,362
[ITOMIMIZU]
Participating in round two,

36
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,099
the Groggy Ring, is
Roronoa Zoro, Sanji,

37
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,135
and Tony Tony Chopper!

38
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:22,603
You better not slow me down.

39
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,138
Right back at ya.

40
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:27,408
I'm gonna try my hardest!

41
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,577
[ITOMIMIZU] And
participating in Round 3,

42
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,046
the Run Roller
Round we've got

43
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:36,550
Monkey D. Luffy,
Nico Robin, Nami, and Usopp!

44
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,586
Aren't we supposed
to have five?

45
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,354
We're one member short here.

46
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,290
Who, cares? Let's go!

47
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,659
[FOXY] A captain, a
swordsman, a navigator,

48
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:49,129
a sniper, a cook, a doctor,
and an archeologist.

49
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,465
So tough, but
I do have to decide

50
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,334
who it is I'm gonna take.

51
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,536
I believe it'd be
that one right there.

52
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,305
Yes, that is the one I want!

53
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,340
All right,

54
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,642
let the merciless
Davy Back begin!

55
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,044
A winner will be
crowned while the loser

56
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,579
will be forcefully drowned!

57
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,381
I am Itomimizu.

58
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,083
You may know me
as the Foxy Pirates

59
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:09,917
party organizer,

60
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,586
but today I will
be your commentator!

61
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,654
Our first event of the day

62
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,458
is round one, the Donut Race!

63
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,260
[ROBIN] How do you guys
think we should team up?

64
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,695
[SANJI] Hmm... Considering
that some of us have

65
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,597
Devil Fruit powers,
it'd make sense

66
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,367
to split into two teams
of three and four people.

67
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,202
[ITOMIMIZU] Legal boats
for the Donut Race

68
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,670
can only be
constructed from two oars

69
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,305
and three empty barrels.

70
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,606
You will be disqualified

71
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,341
if you use any other materials.

72
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,544
This is the perfect chance
for shipwrights to show off.

73
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,280
If you left your
empty barrels at home,

74
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,048
come on up here
and get some!

75
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,751
All for free cause that's
how generous we are!

76
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,152
I'm not entirely sure

77
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,720
if three barrels
is enough material

78
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,256
to build a boat big enough
to hold all four of us.

79
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,492
Right We better go
with three teams.

80
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:52,759
Consisting of...

81
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,731
What the hell?!

82
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,733
Ya can't just bust
them up like that!

83
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,468
Sure I can, just watch.

84
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,703
I am gonna make
us a killer boat.

85
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,742
[ITOMIMIZU] Alright,
I'll take this time

86
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,045
while everyone's
preparing to explain

87
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,413
how the race works.

88
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,481
The course consists
of one lap around

89
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,483
Long Ring Long Land.

90
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,620
It may sound easy, but
believe me, it's not!

91
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,288
If your boat sinks,
your team is

92
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,591
immediately disqualified
from the race.

93
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,726
Oh yeah! Weapons?
They're allowed!

94
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,328
Guns, cannons, explosives,

95
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:29,096
anything you can think of!

96
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,632
If that sounds unfair then
you've got no right at all

97
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,567
to call yourself a pirate!

98
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,703
I'm kind of amazed I finished.

99
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,441
[ITOMIMIZU] And
time is just about up!

100
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:43,344
I hope everyone is ready!

101
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:47,147
Oh! Gather around folks,
the final odds are in!

102
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,316
I'll announce them in
order of their popularity,

103
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,719
starting with the
most popular of course!

104
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,220
Just as I thought!

105
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,655
The top spot
goes to our idol

106
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,124
and fellow Foxy
pirate, Porche!

107
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,693
Oh! You're too kind!

108
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,229
[ITOMIMIZU] Joining her
is the fish-man, Capote!

109
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,098
Their vessel is
the <i>Cutie Wagon,</i>

110
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,134
led by the star shark, Monda!

111
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,771
Yeah!! Take them down,
Porche! You can do it!

112
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:11,672
Hold on!

113
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,440
You've got a shark
pulling your boat?!

114
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,775
I didn't hear him
mention any rules

115
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,177
forbidding the use of sharks.

116
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,246
The second
most popular team.

117
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,448
Well this is
certainly surprising!

118
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,184
It's the Straw Hat
team of Navigator Nami,

119
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,054
Sniper Usopp, and
Archeologist Robin!

120
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:30,157
Their official craft
is the <i>Barrel Tiger</i> !

121
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:30,891
[FOXY CREW D]
That chick with

122
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,693
the orange hair
is smoking hot!

123
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,827
[FOXY CREW C]
I am praying that

124
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,796
the dark haired
babe joins our crew.

125
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,164
[FOXY CREW B]
They can keep the guy.

126
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,165
[FOXY CREW C]
Yeah, agreed.

127
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,166
Ha! Ha!

128
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,468
Well, sounds like the
only thing our Foxy crew

129
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,137
cares about are
the pretty girls!

130
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,606
What a bunch
of horn-balls!

131
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,074
[NAMI] You're sure
this won't sink?

132
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,008
[USOPP]
I told you,

133
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,511
I am not a professional
shipwright, okay?!

134
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:53,414
But I know it's at least
better than those abominations.

135
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,549
Just cause it floats
doesn't mean it's a boat.

136
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,217
It's more like flotsam!

137
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,285
Hahahaha!

138
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,520
Flotsam.

139
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,522
[ZORO] You've got to do
that the whole time?

140
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,358
Yep! It's a good thing
I enjoy running, huh?

141
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,493
[ROBIN]
It's a miracle they float.

142
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,828
It's all on our shoulders

143
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,564
if our crew's gonna
win this race as usual.

144
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,499
[ITOMIMIZU] And coming
in third on our list

145
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,435
is the <i>Harem Nocturne</i> !

146
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,403
A beautiful boat full
of beautiful women

147
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,639
in favor of
beautiful people!

148
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,542
In fourth place we've
got the <i>Crab Crane</i>!

149
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,544
An old favorite
in the top ranks.

150
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:27,681
In fifth and sixth place are
the <i>Swordfish King 1</i> and <i>2</i>!

151
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,651
In seventh place is the
party loving <i>Pleasure Boat</i>!

152
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,186
And in eighth place,

153
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,421
the old reliable <i>Duke Special</i> !

154
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,388
[LUFFY]
What's the deal?!

155
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,791
You gonna even bother
to mention our boat?

156
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,126
[CHOPPER]
Same here! What gives?

157
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,796
Let's see Doctor Chopper

158
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,800
and Swordsman Zoro's boat,
the <i>Basically Barrels</i> is...

159
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,370
Their boat is third
to last in popularity!

160
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,041
Yep, I was expecting worse.

161
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:57,144
And the <i>At Least It
Floats</i> boat... Hahahaha!

162
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,747
Looks like they
win the booby prize!

163
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,283
Hey. What's a booby prize?

164
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,219
It means our boat
is second to last.

165
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:06,553
There can't
seriously be a boat

166
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,655
worse than theirs!

167
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:08,789
Coming in last

168
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:12,426
on the list of popularity
we've got the giant barge,

169
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,595
the behemoth
mother ship <i>Coaster</i> !

170
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,202
You're kidding me...

171
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,805
The oars can't be long
enough for that thing.

172
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,407
And how are they
supposed to steer it?

173
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,641
Hahahahaha!

174
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,777
Yeah, you guys are sharp.

175
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,412
You're right about
the oars, though.

176
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,480
Way too short
And the damned thing

177
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,249
is filled with
seawater too!

178
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,784
Not fair! Those jerks.

179
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:39,587
Wait. No way that thing
is just three barrels.

180
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,588
Sure it is!

181
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,222
We pieced together the
three biggest barrels

182
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,324
we could find.

183
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,191
There ain't nothing
in the rule book

184
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,560
about how small
your barrel's gotta be.

185
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,095
[ITOMIMIZU]
Okay, all of the boats

186
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,130
are now at the starting line!

00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,667

provide commentary

throughout the race
with a bird's eye view

of the action from
atop Chirp Chirp,

Super Sparrow.

00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,178
Go, Porche!

194
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,813
Yeah! Drown that long nose!

195
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,047
Who, Me?!

196
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,283
That's it. We have
to win this now.

197
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,752
Drowning is fair play.
It's in the rules.

198
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,188
Wow. They think they have
a chance of winning.

199
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,022
Let the fools think

200
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,724
whatever they
wanna think, Porche.

201
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,760
We'll sink them right off
the bat Right, Monda?

202

Shay!

203
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,596
I'm excited about this!

204
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,565
What? About losing?

205
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,166
Now pay close attention, Usopp.

206
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,135
If anything happens
to those two ladies,

207
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,536
I'll eviscerate you.

208

We are gonna win
this race, I know it!

Feh-feh-feh-feh!!!

Fool! He honestly
thinks they're gonna win.

00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:39,680
What a riot! No one's
ever beat the Foxy Pirates!

212
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,416
I doubt this race'll
even last five minutes.

213
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,384
Am I right?

214
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,518
Puh-puh-puh-puh...

215

To ensure you don't get lost,

we're providing each

Get lost?

219
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,765
[ITOMIMIZU] Try not to wander
too far from the island's coast.

220
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,570
[NAMI] What's this
doofus talking about?

221
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,538
Why would we
leave the island?

222
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,640
We're taking the inside
track the whole way!

223
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,642
I'm afraid it won't
be that simple.

224
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:09,743
What, why not?

225
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,413
[USOPP] Take a look.
Excluding the big one in back.

226
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,348
All the other boats
are on the outside track

227
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:17,717
facing out to the sea.
It's a little suspicious.

228

Now, on your marks!

Just tell me why
it won't be simple!

Trust me! Hey, listen up!

Get away from

feeling about this!

tell us why already!

Time to reveal the
secret of our boat.

It's got a sneaky
little purpose.

Huh? What's
with the barrels?

Oh, no! We didn't
get far enough!

It's just a barrel.

can't involve touching them.

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,641
The girls need
our help! Let's go!

353
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,743
[ZORO]
Chopper! Let's move!

354
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:46,012
[SANJI] Don't worry,
Nami! I'm coming, Robin!

355
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:48,115
[BEAUTY CREW C]
I'll never forget

356
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,718
your twirly eyebrows!

357
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,753
[USOPP] Our balance!
We gotta stay balanced!

358
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:57,358
Take this! Eat flame!

359
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,059
No thanks.

360
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,661
All right, Ocho Fleurs.

361
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:03,330
What the?!

362
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:04,598
Capote!

363
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,100
And now, flip!

364
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,538
Perfect! Now's
our chance! Usopp!

365
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,607
Jump in the water and
pull the boat! Hurry!

366
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,309
Are you crazy?!

367
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,578
[PORCHE] Capote!
Monda! Get it together!

368
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:18,679
[USOPP]
C'mon! Paddle!

369
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:20,814
[ITOMIMIZU] Alright, folks!

everyone's all-time favorite,

the <i>Cutie Wagon</i> !

372
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:27,221
Right behind in second
place is the <i>Barrel Tiger.</i>

373
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,057

they're back in the running.

374

Third place is the <i>Crab Crane</i> !

375
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,360
Okay I think it's about time

376
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,562
that we get to work, Hamburg.

377
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,798
Really? Oh, boy, I was
hoping you'd say that.

378
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:44,638
Nami. Robin. Just hang tight,

379
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,439
I'm gonna save you!

380
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,712
I just had the best idea ever!

381
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:54,247
Hey, Sanji!
Throw me that board.

382
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,586
[SANJI]
This is really fast!

383
00:16:58,619 --> 00:16:59,587
[LUFFY]
I know, right?!

384
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,256
[SANJI] I'm on my way!
Just hold on, ladies!

385
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,296
[ZORO] We're
getting nowhere here.

386
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,565
I'm pretty sure it'd
be faster if we paddled.

387
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,467
Yeah, well the thing is,

388
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,102
I used the oars to
build this handle.

389
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:25,612
[thinking]
What?!

390
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,487
Not even a "hello," huh?

391
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,354
Not our style.

392
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,724
We believe in winning
any way we can.

393
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:39,626
Really, well,
in that case...

394
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,395
Bull needles!

395
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:49,469

396
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:52,506
Damn!

397
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,042
If we're going down,
we're taking you with us!

398
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,710
Chopper! Look out!

399
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,148
[ITOMIMIZU]
The <i>Basically Barrels</i> and

400
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,784
the <i>Swordfish King</i>
boats have been sunk!

401
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:06,720
They're officially disqualified!

402
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:07,521
Are you okay?

403
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:11,392
That really stunk.
Thank you, Zoro.

404
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,228
You hear that?
They're out of the race.

405
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:17,131
[NAMI] Which means,
we're our only hope.

406
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,065
Hey, wait a sec!

407
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,500
Why don't we just
use one of your dials?

408
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:20,768
Oh! Good idea!

409
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,769
We can give this
breath dial a shot.

410
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,707
[NAMI] We were
going faster before!

411
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,209
[USOPP] Ugh... Don't tell
me we used up all of the wind

412
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,378
while escaping
from Navarone.

413
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,247
[NAMI] Well, do you
have a jet dial on you?

414
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,249
[USOPP] C'mon, you
know how rare those are!

415
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,717
[ROBIN] Why not
use an impact dial?

416
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,718
Uh, gee, you know,

417
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:40,487
I think I must've left
it back on the Merry.

418
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:42,690
What?! You don't believe me?!

419
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,525
Oh, come on, do
you genuinely think

420
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:46,594
I'd lie about
something this important?!

421
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,829
We're talking about
losing a crewmember!

422
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,264
[ROBIN]
I didn't say anything.

423
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,633
He's right. We can't lose here.

424
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,436
There's just too much
at stake. If we lose,

425
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,805
I know they'll
definitely take me first,

426
00:18:57,838 --> 00:19:03,210
I just know it. Oh, why?
Why am I so cute?

427
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,312
Whatever. You just
keep on dreaming.

428
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:08,549
[pow, smack, bang]

429
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:11,418
Robin! This isn't the
best time for reading.

430
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,653
I'm rowing too.

431
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:14,088
Well, yeah, your hands are,

432
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,290
but you're not
really focused on it.

433
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,191
She's right, Robin.

434
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:19,260
You don't wanna end
up like me, right?

435
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:20,427
Better work hard.

436
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,096
[ROBIN]
I am working hard.

437
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:26,433
[USOPP] Yeah, working
hard at archeology.

438
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:27,267
What do think?

439
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,702
Should we head
for the finish line?

440
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:31,105
Or should we enjoy
sinking them first?

441
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,439
I enjoy casually strolling

442
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,441
through the finish line
as much as the next guy,

443
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,710
but I wanna make
that chick suffer.

444
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,112
Simply winning this
thing ain't gonna

445
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:40,047
be enough for me anymore.

has officially entered

The <i>Cutie Wagon</i> 's
holding on to its lead spot,

449
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,422
but the <i>Barrel Tiger</i> 's
right behind them.

450
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:51,492
And the <i>Crab Crane</i>'s
maintaining its spot in third!

451
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,359
What the hell?

452
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:54,428
Where did the <i>Crab Crane</i> go?

453
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:55,729
Oh! There it is!

454
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:56,764
Jeez!

455
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:57,698
Yeah.

456
00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:59,600
Those guys had some
pretty crazy moves.

457
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,768
Unbelievable, folks!

458
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,370
The <i>Crab Crane</i> 's
officially out of the race!

459
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,106
But I don't know
how. What's that?!

460
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:11,245
Fancy meeting you here!

461
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:12,780
See ya, chumps!

462
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:16,116
What?! How're they
even going so fast?!

463
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,386
No more strength.

464
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,155
[CAPOTE]
They stopped.

no fast no more, sleep now.

466
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,228
I think he's given
it all he's got.

467
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,730
Hey, we better
get to paddling

468
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:31,565
before we lose our edge.

469
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,734
Thanks for handing
first place to us!

470
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:36,704
Aw, man! And we just
passed those guys!

471
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:39,740
And that's the last
time you'll even see us.

472
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:41,141
What the?!

473
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:42,543
How's this work for you?

474
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,044
Excellent, Robin!

475
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:48,749
That is downright cheating!
Grrr!! Let go!

476
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:51,085
It's too bad they
already noticed.

477

478
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:55,723
They're gonna pay.

Are you ready to
go again? Luffy?

480
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:00,261
I get the feeling
he's gonna be

481
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:02,296
like this for quite a while.

482
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,164
Let's just keep paddling
with all we've got!

483
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:05,231
We gotta try and catch up

484
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,368
to them before they get
an even bigger lead on us!

485
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:09,603
You're right.
Let's paddle!

486
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:12,806
Well then I guess I'll
be sinking them after all.
