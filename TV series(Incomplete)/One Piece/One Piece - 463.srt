1
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,957
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,794
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,997
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,833
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,603
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,271
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,174
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,011
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,913
they capture the
unwanted attention of

10
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,247
the World Government,

11
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,850
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,954
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:10,190
I can't wait to see what kind
of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:13,460
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:18,565
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,438
[NARRATOR] Separated from the
rest of the Straw Hat crew,

17
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,507
Luffy is headed to
the Navy Headquarters

18
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,309
rescue his brother, Ace.

19
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,115
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, with
Ace's looming execution

20
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:36,516
only a few hours away,

21
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,988
the Whitebeard Pirates
suddenly appear at Navy HQ.

22
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,991
[WHITEBEARD]
We've got plenty to talk about.

23
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,159
Like you not killing my son.

24
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,162
[ACE]
Father!

25
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,229
[NARRATOR]
In an instant,

26
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:52,333
the silence is broken
and all-out war erupts.

27
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,968
[MORIA]
What the...? That's not right.

28
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,804
And here comes the final payoff.

29
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,973
That harmless seaquake he
threatened us with earlier

30
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,210
was just the prelude
to a massive tsunami!

31
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,280
[MARINE CC]
It's a tsunami!

32
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:13,286
[AOKIJI]
Ice Age!

33
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:22,129
[DOFLAMINGO]
Huh?

34
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:25,366
You gonna grace them with
your sword for once?

35
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,635
[MIHAWK]
I'm just gauging the distance.

36
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,636
How far do you think he is?

37
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,939
Strange, but somehow
it feels like...

38
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,709
he's standing right
in front of us.

39
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,854
[LUFFY]
"An All-Consuming Inferno!

40
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,823
Admiral Akainu's Power!"

41
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,103
Ah!

42
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:03,838
Run away!

43
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,472
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES scream]

44
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,351
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE C]
Pops, no!

45
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,687
[JOZU yells]

46
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:37,204
[JOZU yells]

47
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,285
[WHITEBEARD]
Hmm.

48
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,489
That's insane!

49
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,225
He blocked the world's
greatest swordsman.

50
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,107
[JOZU grunts]

51
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:15,642
No! It...

52
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,177
It's him.

53
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:25,218
[MARINE A] Third division
commander, Diamond Jozu!

54
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:51,912
[MARINE B gasps, groans]

55

[MARINES groan]

56
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,184
Wouldn't let my guard
down, if I were you!

57
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,021
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE D]
C'mon, guys!

58
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,823
Keep advancin' on
the front line!

59
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:05,359
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES yell]

60
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,593
Push them back!

[MARINES yell]

62
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,476
Damn fools.

63
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,011
They're trying to break
through from the front.

64
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,648
[SENGOKU]
Attenion artillery unit!

65
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:33,287
Open fire on all enemy ships as
well as the approaching pirates!

66

[MARINES]
Sir!

67
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,330
[MARINE AA]
Forward units!

68
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:45,833
Block off all access
to this plaza!

69
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,500
[MARINES]
Sir!

72
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,151
My, my.

73
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:08,989
[KIZARU]
Whitebeard's commanders

74
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,826
are a frightening bunch of
monsters, aren't they?

75
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:15,161
Though I do admit,
they put on a good show.

76
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,137
[KIZARU] Still, if we want
to stop this party

77
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,139
before they wreck the place,

78
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:29,509
we simply need to remove the
head of this unruly, behemoth.

79
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:43,657
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES grunt]

80
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,025
It's so bright!

81
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,693
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE F]
What the hell?!

82
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,807
Ah! It's Kizaru!

83
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,177
Yasakani Sacred Jewel!

84
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,515
It's too bright.

85
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,351
Could ya tone it
down a little, pal?

86
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,491
[KIZARU]
Hm?

87
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,279
[WHITEBEARD chuckles]

88
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,149
He stopped the Admiral's
attack, but how?

89
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,818
I dunno!

90
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,455
It's almost like he's got wings!

91
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:51,858
Huh? Well, fancy that!

92
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,861
[MARCO]
The king's off limits.

93
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,197
If you wanna reach him...

94
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,935
...you gotta go
through me first.

95
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,606
Scary.

96
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,608
These Whitebeards play rough.

97
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,508
What the...?

98
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,343
He's on fire!

99
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,780
[MARINE J]
He took Kizaru's attack head on

100
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,149
and he's just... floating there!

101
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,851
[MARINE K] I dunno what
kind of Devil Fruit that is,

102
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:19,719
but I don't like it!

103
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,257
Even more rare
than Logia powers.

104
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,327
Zoan type. Mythical creature.

105
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,464
[MARINE BB]
Look! His wounds are healing!

106
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,099
[MARINE CC]
This can't be real.

107
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,367
That didn't hurt him at all?

108
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,305
Oh, it did.

109
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,480
Don't lie to protect my pride.

110
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,982
[MARCO yells]

111
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,625
So that must be the 1st
division commander. Whoa.

"If his flames can't
turn away an attack,

113
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,962
then they can heal
him when it's done!"

114
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,664
Marco the Phoenix!

115
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:10,503
Look at that lovely bird.
It must be quite rare!

116
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,646
[KIZARU]
Uh?

[MARCO grunts]

118
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:28,155
Well, that's quite
the painful kick!

119
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,224
Now you're lying! Ha!

120
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,768
[MARINES gasping]

121
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:50,477
Just standing here
is dangerous enough!

He okay? Kizaru!

123
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,052
[MARINES gasp]

124
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,588
[KIZARU]
Hm... My fault.

125
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,324
I really should've known better.

126
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,627
If your boss was
that easy to kill,

127
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,863
you wouldn't be here
right now, would you?

128
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:14,968
Heh.

00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:20,841

on the sky from now on!

Damn those two, cocky hotheads.

What were they thinking,

148
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,551
abandoning their
posts like that?

[AKAINU] What if I had
done the same, huh?

that block of ice.

[HARUTO grunts]

179
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,209
[BLAMENCO chuckles]

180
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,645
[MARINES groan]

181
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,748
Take out the commanders
at all costs!

182
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:38,618
[MARINE EE] Don't let them get
ashore! Sink the Moby Dick!

183
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:41,588
Push forward and
aim for Whitebeard!

184
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,431
[COBY whimpers]

185
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:57,170
[COBY]
These are pirates, my enemy.

186
00:18:57,204 --> 00:19:01,041
This isn't a training
exercise, this is war!

187
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:04,878
I can't!

188
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,549
[COBY] My knees are
frozen! I can't move!

189
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,387
[HELMEPPO]
It's pointless.

190
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:18,025
These guys would slaughter us
without a second glance!

191
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:19,392
[COBY whimpers]

192
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,864
I mean, you realize
that, right?

193
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,699
[COBY whimpers]

194
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,067
[HELMEPPO]
Just look around you.

195
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,936
They're monsters, butchers!

196
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:30,704
There's not a single
thing amateurs like us

197
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:32,472
can do against
guys like that!

198
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,776
We've gotta run if
we wanna live, okay?

199
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,310
Okay?

200
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,545
[COBY]
But...

201
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:41,048
Look, don't be an idiot!
There is no but!

202
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:42,282
Do you understand me?

203
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,118
The only thing we can
contribute to this battle

204
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:47,354
is more blood for those
killers to spill over the ice!

205
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,355
[COBY exhales]

206
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,356
Just listen!

207
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,358
You wanna become an
admiral, don't you?!

208
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,392
[COBY gasps]

209
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:58,398
Because I promised myself
that I'll keep trying.

210
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:03,304
Till, till I become
a Marine Admiral!

211
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:05,305
You said you're gonna
fight me, right?

212
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:08,341
Then you will become that
strong. You'll have to.

213
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,409
[COBY]
Uh...!

214
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:15,749
Hey, look!

215
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,784
Don't take this the wrong
way! I'm just sayin'.

216
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,120
That's why we should run!

217
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:20,687
We both have a future!

218
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:24,291
It's not right for either
of us to die here!

219
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,360
There's too much
left for us to do!

220
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,362
We're the chosen ones!

221
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:33,167
But, Luffy! I made a
promise to him, didn't I?

222
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,002
[BOTH gasp]

223
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:37,805
[HELMEPPO]
What now? Where is it?

224
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:39,139
[gasps]

225
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,491
Here he comes!

226
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,535
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES groaning]

227
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:19,346
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES yell]

228
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,566
[MARINE W]
Attack! Kill it!

229
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:46,707
All right, bring down
their artillery defense!

230
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,509
[OARS JR. growls]

231
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,645
[MARINE X whimpers]

232
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,183
[ALL gasp]

233
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:04,525
[OARS JR.]
Brother Ace!

234
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:05,892
[ACE gasps]

235
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:07,194
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES cheer]

236
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:11,665
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE M] Nicely
done! Get 'em, little Oars Jr!

237
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:14,367
[OARS JR. roars]

238
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,176
He must be related to
the Continent Puller.

239
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:24,845
He's enormous!

240
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:27,981
At least twice as big as
one of the regular giants.

241
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,450
We can't let him invade
the island, no matter what!

242
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:32,519
He'll give them too much
leverage in the fight!

243
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:37,024
[MORIA cackles] Just look
at that beautiful beast!

244
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:41,027
And I didn't even know that
Oars had a living descendant!

245
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:45,932
I want it! I call his
corpse after the battle!

246
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:50,338
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

247
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:52,806
Now that's more like it!

248
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,010
[ACE whimpers]

249
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,178
Little Oars!

250
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:02,182
Ace is a nice guy!
He's my friend!

251
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:05,219
I'm not gunna let you hurt him.

252
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:08,255
He won't die!

253
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,695
[NARRATOR]
Although the Straw Hat Crew's

254
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:16,963
battle with Oars is
long in the past,

255
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:19,366
Little Oars Jr. is
still wreaking havoc

256
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,201
as a member of
White Beard's crew.

257
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,504
Bursting through the bay,
he goes head-to-head with

258
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:27,674
the Navy's team of giants in
an Earth-shaking confrontation.

259
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,443
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

260
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,278
"A Descendant of the Beast!

261
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:33,981
Little Oars Jr.
Full Speed Ahead!"

262
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:36,683
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
