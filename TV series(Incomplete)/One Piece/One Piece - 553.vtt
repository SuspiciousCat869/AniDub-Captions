00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.005
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:08.041
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:10.810
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.113
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.482
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.555
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.826
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.925
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:41.861
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:47.000
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.602
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:52.872
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:54.774
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.243
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:03:00.079
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.517
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.119
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:09.822
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:14.127
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:18.932
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:21.701
Luffy and his crew
arrive on Fishman Island,

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:25.805
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:28.208
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:33.079
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:36.349
[NARRATOR] It's not long
before the Straw Hats

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.418
get pulled into the conflict.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:44.857
That is my army.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:48.595
Thirty-thousand slaves
we've captured this month.

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:50.496
All human, too.

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:55.235
And then there's 70,000 Fishmen.

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:57.203
Trained in combat.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.839
They're all from
the Fishman District!

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:02.008
Or can't you tell?

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.643
Now behold.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:08.715
One hundred thousand
united outlaws!

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:11.851
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES cheering]

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:12.986
You see?

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.988
This is power!

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:19.359
Because my followers
have faith in change!

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:21.160
It's taken ten years.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:25.298
But it' s time that we finished
what I began so long ago!

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:27.533
And you know what started it?

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:29.802
The death of Queen Otohime!

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:31.070
Yes, that's right!

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.939
I've got a little secret!

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:34.741
Wanna hear?

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.611
The one who shot her...

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:42.749
...was me!

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.253
That can't be true!

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.689
[HORDY] Even in her death,
your mother changed the island

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:52.392
by turning the humans
into villains once more.

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.894
And yet, it wasn't them.

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:57.897
No. It was her own subject!

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.233
The fishman standing
in front of you!

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:02.669
I did it! I killed her!

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:05.405
Because it was necessary!

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:13.980
I knew you did it.

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:14.781
[gasps]

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.249
[NEPTUNE]
Shirahoshi!

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:19.619
[ALL gasp]

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.457
What'd you say?

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:31.431
[LUFFY] "Shirahoshi's Tears!
Luffy Finally Shows Up!"

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:46.379
You already knew that
I murdered your mother?

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:48.781
How can that be?

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:52.685
Explain yourself
right now, Shirahoshi!

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:59.992
[NEPTUNE panting]

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.394
--[NEPTUNE groans]

Father! Are you all right?

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:05.398
Stay strong!

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:08.868
[NEPTUNE groaning]

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:11.204
[NEPTUNE]
Shirahoshi!

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:16.008
A few years after
mother's death,

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:19.779
Megalo told me in secret
about everything that happened.

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:21.013
Megalo?

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.782
[JIMBEI]
He told you?

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.290
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Tell me it isn't true!

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:32.859
Are you sure?

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.732
Oh, no.

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:48.474
[SHIRAHOSHI crying]

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:54.213
At the time, Megalo was the
property of Neptune's army.

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:57.784
And he witnessed the
incident with his own eyes.

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:03.489
[gunshot]

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:07.960
Mother, no! Mother!

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:14.100
[chuckles]

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:23.443
[growling]

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:26.345
Princess.

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:29.015
You knew all of this,
and yet you never told a soul?

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:30.950
How could I?

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.324
If I did, I was afraid
that our countrymen

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:40.526
might hold a grudge
against Hordy.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.129
[ALL gasp]

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:46.265
[SHIRAHOSHI] And that--
that is not what my dear mother

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.567
would have wanted!

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.837
[FISHMAN A gasps]

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:01.681
[SHIRAHOSHI] That was the
final promise we made to her

00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:03.549
as she lay dying.

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:08.855
She said that no matter who
it was who took her life...

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:10.923
...we should not be angry,

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:13.226
or let our hearts be
filled with hatred!

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.460
[FUKABOSHI gasps]

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:21.167
It doesn't matter
who did this to me.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.969
Don't become angry.

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:25.738
Not on my behalf.

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:27.874
Don't submit to resentment.

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:30.142
Don't let hatred get
the better of you.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:33.279
Not in my name, or any other.

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:34.780
Shirahoshi.

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:36.249
So that was why.

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:39.118
All these years...
and not a word.

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:40.753
Our mother's final wish.

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.923
You've kept it deep in
your heart until today.

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.262
[FUKABOSHI]
Closed in the Hard Shell Tower,

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.831
you've carried this
burden all alone,

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:54.934
your foolish brothers
blissfully ignorant.

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:03.175
[JIMBEI]
She suffered in silence,

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:06.145
even knowing that her
mother's killer ran free.

00:09:06.178 --> 00:09:08.247
Despite my loyalty to the queen,

00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.917
I could not fathom
such forgiveness.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.086
I would not have the
strength to keep my word.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.089
And yet, she was
true to her oath.

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:20.793
You truly honor your
mother's legacy, Princess.

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:27.133
[laughing]

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:28.868
Stop laughing, you fool!

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.136
I can't help it!

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:32.104
This is downright comical!

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:34.140
And Megalo!

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:36.909
[HORDY] There was
nothing to stop you from

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:39.478
shouting to the top of
your lungs that day,

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:42.381
and letting everyone know
I was the one responsible

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.183
for killing Otohime.

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:47.186
So, thank you for
keeping your mouth shut.

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:49.555
And for choosing this
pathetic fool of a girl

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:53.225
as the one and only keeper
of your little secret!

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.994
If you'd told
anyone else about it,

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:58.197
we never would've been
able to make it this far!

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.167
[HORDY laughs]

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.135
Convenient though it was,

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:07.206
where I come from, we call
actions like yours "idiotic"!

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:09.008
Your kingdom is about to fall,

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:11.277
and all because of
some meaningless promise

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.279
to a dead woman.

00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:15.648
Sure, you honored her words.

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.917
But now you, your family,
and your subjects

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.619
are all going to die.

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:23.623
I hope it was
worth it, Shirahoshi!

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:28.394
Pay that murderer
no heed, Your Majesty!

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:30.429
Believe me, you have
done nothing wrong!

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.531
[laughs]

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:35.101
Not wrong,
just incredibly stupid!

Stop this! Please, no!

Heh.

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:38.130
No. We're doomed.

They're the great
warriors? Yeah, right!

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.203
We crushed them like a
bunch of worms! [laughs]

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:47.506
[IKAROS chuckles] The captain
made quick work of 'em,

didn't he-hii?

They won't even make it to the
execution, if you ask me-hii!

[HORDY chuckles]
Well, we can't have that.

00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:59.618
The royal family should face
death by beheading, after all.

Now, someone hand me a sword.

were Jimbei and Shirahoshi.

Now that they're here,

there's no reason we can't kick
off this execution right now!

At long last, these foul vermin
known as the royal family

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.941
will be slaughtered by my hand!

Hey! When is that pirate
with the hat coming?

He was gonna destroy
the island, right?

Well? When is he coming?

I honestly couldn't tell you.

The only thing I can see is
what will happen in the future.

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:19.431
I simply have no way
of discerning when.

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:21.500
[FISHBOY B]
I want him to come now.

00:13:25.237 --> 00:13:28.808
If he comes here and tries
to start a fight right now,

00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:30.776
we might be in trouble.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.845
But so will the bad guys!

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:34.380
He has to show up!

00:13:34.413 --> 00:13:37.850
'Cause if he doesn't, that man
is gonna kill King Neptune!

00:13:37.883 --> 00:13:39.752
Where is he?

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:44.790
[FISHCHILDREN crying]

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.595
[FISHMAN E]
You're exactly right, children.

00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:52.464
That pirate is our only hope.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.800
[FISHWOMAN B cries]

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:07.179
[FISHMAN E]
Hey! Straw Hat Luffy!

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.082
[HORDY]
Hm?

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:12.885
If you want to destroy
this island, go ahead.

00:14:12.918 --> 00:14:14.820
Hurry up!

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:17.957
Tear this place to
pieces, we don't care!

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.393
Straw Hat! I know you're
out there somewhere!

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:25.164
If you're close enough to
hear us, come and fight!

00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:27.399
Please, hurry!

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:33.906
[FISHMEN] Straw Hat! Straw
Hat! Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:40.412
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:45.384
Straw Hat! Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:54.159
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:12.745
[FISHMEN crying]

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:15.681
[FISHMEN]
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:21.453
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!
Straw Hat! Straw Hat!

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:23.322
Straw Hat! Straw Hat...

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:24.890
Wretched fools.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:28.627
If that's their only hope,
then they're better off dead.

00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:29.762
As far as I know,

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:32.398
Sharley's premonitions
have always been reliable.

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:35.935
But I'll be damned if
this one comes true.

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:38.304
[ZEO]
It's meaningless folly.

00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:40.773
[HORDY] Perhaps I should
bring these desperate worms

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:42.975
back to their senses.

00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:45.377
[FISHMEN gasping]

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:46.445
[FISHBOY B gasps]

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:49.315
Listen, you morons!

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:53.385
It's time for the
dawning of a new era.

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:55.521
So say goodbye to your king!

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:56.255
[gasps]

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:59.091
[FUKABOSHI groans]
No. Stop!

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:01.093
[HORDY]
Watch carefully, everyone!

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:03.862
This is history in
the making, after all!

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:06.899
It's not every day you
see a king's head roll!

00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:08.701
This mediocre ruler of yours,

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:10.903
without a drop of pride
for his own race,

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:12.404
will be no more.

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:14.707
And the new kingdom of
Fishmen will rise up

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.742
to conquer those
miserable humans,

00:16:16.775 --> 00:16:20.245
as we were meant to
do from the start!

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:23.415
Now witness the demise
of the Ryugu Kingdom,

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:26.352
once and for all!

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:32.958
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES cheering]

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:38.998
[HORDY laughing]

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.342
[NEPTUNE]
I've failed.

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:52.077
Farewell!

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:55.014
[gasps]

00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:59.318
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Luffy.

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:04.790
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Please!

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.029
I need you!

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:12.031
Save my father!

00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:15.501
Hurry!

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:16.668
[HORDY yells]

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.070
[thud]

00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:22.241
[HORDY]
Hm?

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:23.942
[thud]

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:29.982
[MEGALO groaning]

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:32.985
[RYUBOSHI]
Megalo?

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:45.464
[HORDY]
Hm?

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:50.669
[groans]

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:58.944
[yelling]

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:14.426
[FISHMEN]
What?! It can't be!

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:22.201
[FISHMEN]
It is! It's Straw Hat Luffy!

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:24.136
I can't believe it!

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:26.772
He really did show up!

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.375
[FISHMAN DD]
Whoa, did you see that?

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:32.878
He just saved
King Neptune's life!

00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:35.514
Yeah! Maybe he's okay.

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:39.685
I mean, Princess Shirahoshi
did call him for help, right?

00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:42.020
Please, Luffy!

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:43.722
[ZEO]
Wait. He was in the shark?

00:18:43.755 --> 00:18:46.325
[DARUMA yells] Hiding in
its stomach, it looks like.

00:18:46.358 --> 00:18:47.626
That's gross!

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:50.529
Luffy. I thought
I told you to wait.

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:53.165
But I suppose there was
no choice, was there?

00:18:53.198 --> 00:18:55.567
Come out! All of you, right now!

00:18:55.601 --> 00:18:57.369
Muhi! What does he mean?

00:18:57.402 --> 00:18:59.838
I don't see anybody-hii!

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:02.641
[NAMI] We were prepared for
this from the beginning.

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:06.478
[NAMI] See, the plan was
for Luffy to sit tight

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:07.880
and wait a while.

00:19:07.913 --> 00:19:11.683
But it's Luffy,
so that wasn't happening.

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.053
Mirage, release!

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:17.156
[IKAROS gasps]
Where'd you come from?

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:19.858
You scared me-hii!

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:20.759
[NAMI]
Is this it?

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:23.462
The letter from the
Celestial Dragons?

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.230
That's it, excellent work!

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:28.433
But it's right--hey!
The letter's gone!

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:30.035
How'd she get it?

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:32.171
How the hell could
you let that happen?

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:34.640
[NAMI] Hmph. Oh, and I
gave the key to Robin.

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:38.544
Huh? But it's right he--
Ah! It's gone, too!

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:41.313
That's what you get for
yellin' at me, jerk!

00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:45.117
Huh? Hey, we're free!

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.919
Who did that?

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:48.153
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Huh?

00:19:49.488 --> 00:19:50.923
It's Robin!

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.326
[NEPTUNE]
What?

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:56.361
[FUKABOSHI]
Please! Stay with us, Father!

00:19:56.395 --> 00:19:58.096
[RANDOM AMMO KNIGHT] Look up
in the sky! What is that?

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.598
[BOTH gasp]

00:19:59.631 --> 00:20:02.034
[NEPTUNE]
Unbelievable.

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:05.103
It's a whale and... a lion?

00:20:05.137 --> 00:20:08.640
No, wait, that's... a ship!

00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:13.178
[FRANKY]
Heh, heh. Gaon Cannon!

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:19.218
It's aiming right at us!

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:21.486
Fire!

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:32.598
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:34.233
[FRANKY]
Now's your chance! Go get 'em!

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:38.637
[HOE bellows]

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:40.806
[FUKABOSHI]
Hoe?

00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:44.409
Quickly! Take King Neptune
and get to safety!

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:46.612
I'm grateful.

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:50.482
It's time for you to go.
Boomsun! [grunts]

00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:51.950
[HOE bellows]

00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:53.051
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE BB]
That whale's escaping

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.853
with the royal family!

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:59.157
Damn it! We'll catch
you and make you pay!

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:02.194
[NEPTUNE]
Huh? What happened, my son?

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:06.265
[pants] I can't say for certain,

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:07.766
but it would appear
that Jimbei's made

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:10.335
some sort of plan
with the Straw Hats.

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:17.142
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES gasping]

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:23.615
[FISHMAN EE]
I don't believe it.

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:25.617
Straw Hat actually came!

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:29.588
That's his crew! There, look!

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:32.791
[CHOPPER]
Oh, wow!

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:35.360
That's a pretty big
crowd they've got!

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:36.561
This is nuts.

00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:38.697
What, are we fighting
a whole army now?

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.098
I guess so.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:42.434
Looks like about 80,000 guys.

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:44.469
No, hundred thousand, maybe.

00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:47.806
[BROOK chuckles] Not a
bare-bones operation, then.

00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:50.942
You might as well go
take a nap, Curly Brows.

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:52.711
I can handle these chumps.

00:21:52.744 --> 00:21:54.913
[SANJI]
Aren't naps your thing?

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:58.917
Heh, heh. Well, this
oughtta be pretty fun.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.786
And there's plenty
of ass to kick.

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:02.587
So let's party!

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:05.157
Look! It's the rest
of the Straw Hats!

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.059
They're getting off the ship!

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:19.404
Hey! Straw Hat Luffy!

00:22:19.438 --> 00:22:22.808
Are you guys really planning
on destroying Fishman Island?

00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:26.378
[FISHMAN FF] Why did you
take over the Ryugu Palace?

00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:29.081
Did you want to kill the
royal family yourselves?

00:22:29.114 --> 00:22:31.350
[FISHMAN GG] Were you the ones
who kidnapped the mermaids?

00:22:31.383 --> 00:22:33.085
Answer me!

00:22:33.118 --> 00:22:34.519
[FISHMAN HH]
Come on, Straw Hat,

00:22:34.553 --> 00:22:36.822
the least you could do
is say something!

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:39.691
Are you guys supposed to be
our friends or our enemies?

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:42.728
[FISHMAN II]
Explain yourself, Straw Hat!

00:22:50.168 --> 00:22:52.971
[LUFFY]
Friends or enemies, huh?

00:22:53.004 --> 00:22:54.806
Don't ask me.

00:23:03.915 --> 00:23:07.819
'Cause I'd say...
it's up to you!

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:17.429
[NARRATOR] After a tricky
escape from the Ryugu Palace,

00:23:17.462 --> 00:23:19.898
the Straw Hats have
reassembled at last.

00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:22.134
As they march into
Conchcorde Plaza,

00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:25.337
an army of new Fishmen
Pirates stands before them.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.439
The final battle of the
fate of Fishman Island

00:23:27.472 --> 00:23:31.943
begins with a show of strength
between the two would-be kings.

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:33.612
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:37.883
"A Big Clash! The Straw Hats vs.
A Hundred Thousand Enemies!"

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:40.685
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
