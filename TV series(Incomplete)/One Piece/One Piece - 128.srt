00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,262
[TERRACOTTA]
Here's more! Eat up!

173
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,863
Old man, I never
knew you were the king!

174
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,166
I guess that means you're
also Vivi's dad, huh?

175
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,267
That's pretty cool.

176
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,470
Uh, maybe we should
talk after dinner.

177
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,604
[LUFFY]
Yeah, okay.

178
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,474
I need another round
down here, guys!

179
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,776
And water down here!

180
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,345
They're loud,
uncouth, and disgusting.

181
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,847
I'll say! I can't watch!

182
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,615
[chattering, munching]

183
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,151
[laughing]

184
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,019
The princess‐‐

185
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,620
How can she keep
laughing like that?

186
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,856
[USOPP] Bean sprouts!
I want sauteed bean sprouts!

187
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:42,462
[GROUP chattering, munching]

188
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:47,467
[ALL laughing]

189
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,186
[COBRA]
This is the palace's royal bath.

190
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,522
Normally we only use it
during the rainy season.

191
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,857
[USOPP]
I'm royally impressed!

192
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,824
It's gorgeous!

193
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,226
I'm goin' in first!

194
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,827
[LUFFY]
No way! I am!

195
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,262
[SANJI]
Real mature, guys.

196
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,898
Well. That was some dinner
tonight, wasn't it?

197
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,867
I thought an after‐dinner
bath would be a more

198
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,934
sedate affair.

199
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,370
But it seems anything
you lads get involved with

200
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,372
becomes a party very quickly.

201
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,840
[LUFFY]
Hey, Zoro, look over here!

202
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,175
Look at what we're doing!

203
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,343
[USOPP]
We're training!

204
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,177
[ZORO]
Real funny.

205
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,379
Um... Hey.
Where's the women's bath?

206
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,548
You're nuts!
And why would I tell you that?

207
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,216
That's where the princess is!

208
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,252
I know!

209
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,620
[COBRA]
It's right behind that wall!

210
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,221
Your Majesty!

211
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,190
[USOPP] Hey, thanks,
old guy! You're the best!

212
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,726
[NAMI]
This feels so good!

213
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,395
I wonder if a ship with a
big bath like this exists.

214
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,596
[VIVI]
I'm sure one does.

215
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,899
The sea's full of surprises.

216
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,534
Think of what we've seen.

217
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,235
Giants and dinosaurs.

218
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,871
Blossoms blooming
in a winter land.

219
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,274
If those things exist,
there must be plenty of

220
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,409
more amazing things
out there in the sea.

221
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,313
[VIVI]
I... I guess.

222
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,481
My turn!

223
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,916
[VIVI chuckles]
Thank you.

224
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,387
What are you all
doing over there?

225
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,421
Peeping.

226
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,324
All right.

227
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,993
It'll cost 100,000
Berries each.

228
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,994
[USOPP]
Huh?

229
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,629
[NAMI]
Happiness... Punch!

230
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,497
[GROUP gasps]

231
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,565
Nami!

232
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:27,833
[NAMI chuckles]

233
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,735
[SANJI]
Nami swan...!

234
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,408
Can't make up your mind?

235
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,409
What?

236
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,510
Better think quick.

237
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,012
I was thinking we might
actually leave here tonight.

238
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,980
Really?

239
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,449
Yeah, we need to go
while the goings good.

240
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,918
We know that the Marines
are looking all over for us,

241
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,321
and that means the ship
is in danger.

242
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,795
Thank you.

243
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,862
[GROUP]
Pervert.

244
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,297
[COBRA]
Not for that!

245
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,268
For the country.

246
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,877
It's not that we
don't appreciate it,

247
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,879
but is a king supposed
to do that?

248
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,282
The swordsman is right,
Your Majesty.

249
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,783
You're this land's
sovereign ruler‐‐

250
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,619
you should bow to no one.

251
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,387
Listen, Igaram.

252
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,358
Authority is something that
you wear over your clothes.

253
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,626
But we're in the bath now,

254
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,828
and there is no such
thing as a naked king,

255
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:29,996
is there?

256
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,398
I want to thank all of you
from the bottom of my heart,

257
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,967
as both a father and
a native of this land,

258
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,304
Alabasta will forever be
in your debt, Straw Hats.

259
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,339
[LUFFY laughing]

260
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,677
Thank you all very much.

261
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,480
I cannot tell you how
much we appreciate you!

262
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,654
[USOPP]
Tonight?

263
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,655
[NAMI]
Yep.

264
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,556
[CHOPPER]
We have to leave?

265
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,825
The Marines know we're here.
More'll be coming.

266
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:00,993
I agree with Nami.

267
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,528
We need to get out now

268
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,496
Me, too.

269
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,431
And not just 'cause
she's got a pretty face.

270
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,832
[USOPP] Do you think
we should leave, Luffy?

271
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,335
[LUFFY] Yeah, but only
after we've had some more

272
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,069
yummy food!

273
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,370

No, now, you idiot!

00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,438
[GROUP]
Jeez, Luffy!

275
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,839
[CHAKA]
What should we do, Igaram?

276
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,941
We have to let them
know right away!

277
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,444
You're right. I agree. Well...

278
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,880
Word of what's happened
here has traveled fast.

279
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,849
They've already released
new wanted posters,

280
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,785
and the bounties
are quite large.

281
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,889
Roronoa Zoro.
Sixty million Berries!

282
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,894
Monkey D. Luffy.
One hundred million Berries!

283
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,062
[CHAKA]
Incredible.

284
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,364
[IGARAM] With bounties like
that, Marine Headquarters

285
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,567
must have a keen interest
in capturing the Straw Hats.

286
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,437
You're no longer a
mere pirate, Luffy.

287
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,139
Not since you took down
one of the Seven Warlords

288
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,441
of the Sea!

289
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,060
[IGARAM panting]

290
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,897
[IGARAM]
We've got trouble!

291
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:12,932
[gasps]

292
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,840
[IGARAM]
Vivi! Where are they?

293
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,877
[VIVI]
Oh, Igaram, what is it?

294
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,378
Luffy and all the others.

295
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,446
Where are they?

296
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,049
The sea. They are pirates.

297
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,384
[IGARAM]
Oh, no.

298
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,889
Listen up, you guys.
Pirates are nothing but scum.

299
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,957
Every one of them.

300
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,859
Hey, wait.
Don't you remember?

301
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,026
What are you saying?

302
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,863
Come on. You used to be one.

303
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,865
You're right!
How could I forget?

304
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,933
Uh‐huh, oh, baby!

305
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,368
Let's dance!

306
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,238
[JANGO]
Aw, yeah! Dance! Dance!

307
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,074
That's right, in a funky style!

308
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,309
[music playing]

309
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,478
[SGT SHINE] It looks like those
two subdued the enemy ship.

310
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,080
[HINA]
It took them long enough.

311
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,415
Don't tell me.
They're dancing, right?

312
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,417
I trusted those two to
finish off that pirate ship

313
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,887
that tried to escape us
and this is what they do.

314
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,389
Disappointed.
Hina's disappointed.

315
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,158
Have you finished
deploying all the ships?

316
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,425
Yes, that's affirmative, Ma'am!

317
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,394
Every harbor in this
dust ball of a country

318
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,730
is now blockaded!

319
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,931
But Ma'am.

320
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,832
[HINA]
Hm?

321
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,400
There's one thing
I'm concerned about.

322
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,334
What's that?

323
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,737
Well, it's just the
Straw Hats' ship, ma'am.

324
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,072
It was confirmed to be
near Erumalu, and now...

325
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,107
...it's gone.

326
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,109
Don't tell me they've
left the country already!

327
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,477
No! I doubt that, Ma'am!

328
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,246
Then go search for it!
Scour the entire coast!

329
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,981
Yes! Right away!

330
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,116
Oh, no.

331
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,251
[FULLBODY] Miss Hina!
We're sorry it took us so long.

332
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,787
[JANGO] Aren't you gonna
ask us why it took so long?

333
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,022
[HINA]
Why'd it take so long?

334
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,791
Because we were picking these
flowers for you, Miss Hina!

335
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,160
[HINA] No thanks. Now man
your positions right away!

336
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,429
We're going after
the Straw Hat pirates.

337
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,997
The Straw Hats?!

338
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,034
[DUCKS squawking]

339
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,369
Not bad.

340
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,105
So a final farewell,
o' kingdom of the sand.

341
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,340
Luffy, aren't you full yet?

342
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,009
[LUFFY] These Alabasta dishes
are great aren't they, Sanji?

343
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,277
You should make 'em sometime.

344
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,178
Yeah, I liked 'em too,

345
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,347
so I got some recipes
from Terracotta.

346
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,450
I also got some of
their local spices.

347
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,953
Um... What's wrong, Nami?
Are you sick?

348
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,456
[LUFFY] I'll give you a
piece of this if you want,

349
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,124
but just a small one.

350
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,295
Nami, if you're thinking
about Vivi again,

351
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,830
I understand.

352
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,167
Listen. Moping around
about it won't help.

353
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,303
I know it must be really hard
for you. You two got close.

354
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,505
Just keep your chin up, 'kay?

355
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,545
[NAMI]
It's not that.

356
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,152
I'm just sad
we didn't take the reward.

357
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,487
The one billion Berries.

358
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,488
[GROUP]
Gah!

359
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,357
You're moping about the money?!

360
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,058
[CHOPPER]
Agh! Usopp fell off!

361
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,261
[ZORO] You shouldn't mislead
people like that, Nami!

362
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,996
[NAMI] What did you
think I was upset about?

363
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,998
We just walked away
from a huge payday

364
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,266
that we actually earned!

365
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,867
[CHOPPER]
Guys, Usopp fell down!

366
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,235
[NAMI]
That's his problem!

367
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,937
[LUFFY, ZORO, CHOPPER]
But you caused it!

368
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,206
[IGARAM]
Karoo! Wake up!

369
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,073
You're needed!

370
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,408
[KAROO squawks]

371
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,110
[VIVI]
It's no use, Igaram.

372
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,344
[IGARAM] But the world
government has released

373
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,946
new bounties on their heads.

374
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,180
We should at least warn them.

375
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,182
[VIVI] I had the Duck
Squadron take them.

376
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,918
Even if Karoo could
catch up to them,

377
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,352
it wouldn't change anything.

378
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,387
[IGARAM]
Why's that?

379
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,621
Those new bounties...

380
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,223
They'll actually
make them happy.

381
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,457
They'll all be tickled pink.

382
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:26,258
[IGARAM]
But Princess, they‐‐!

383
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,927
[VIVI]
Trust me, they'll be fine!

384
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,028
Now out you go!

385
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,529
I've got to get some rest.

386
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,598
I've got a big day
tomorrow, remember?

387
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,233
Oh, that's right!

388
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,201
Your coming‐of‐age ceremony
is tomorrow morning

389
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,303
at ten!

390
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,270
Uh‐huh.

391
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,040
Now come on, Karoo.
Let's get some sleep.

392
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,041
[KAROO squawks]

393
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,375
[door closes]

394
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,281
[CHAKA]
Igaram...

395
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,050
[IGARAM]
Something's bothering me.

396
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,251
[CHAKA]
Hey!

397
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,220
[IGARAM]
She's awfully calm.

398
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,890
Strange. Very strange.

399
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,631
[KAROO snoring]

400
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,301
[VIVI] It's really quiet,
isn't it, Karoo?

401
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,904
We haven't had a night
this quiet in a long time.

402
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,474
The cook who guards
the refrigerator

403
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,177
from a late‐night
raider is gone.

404
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,146
So too is the swordsman
who trains every night.

405
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,317
The navigator who throws
pillows when she's asleep.

406
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,186
Her, too. They're gone.

407
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,459
[NAMI]
Snail communication? From who?

408
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,260
Don't know.
He called himself Bon.

409
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,662
Just Bon? That's it?

410
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:37,863
Uh, never heard of the guy.

411
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,266
That's strange. He insists
that you're all good friends.

412
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,601
[SANJI]
Friends with us?

413
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,705
[MR. 2] Hello? Hey,
old friends, it's me!

414
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,873
[laughing]

415
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,342
I betcha never thought you'd
hear from me again, did‐‐?

416
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,012
[MR. 2 screeching]

417
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,480
You freak! Shut up!

418
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,283
So you escaped, Mr. 2,
and what do you want?

419
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,051
[MR. 2]
Straw Hat!

420
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,387
I'd recognize that
voice anywhere!

421
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,955
You're right, I escaped,

422
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:06,291
and I wanna keep it that way,
so don't call me Mr. 2!

423
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,293
If the Marines intercept
this call, they'll be able

424
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,230
to ascertain the locations
of both me and you!

425
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,664
Thanks a lot, you jerk!

426
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,299
Tell us what you want!

427
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,968
[MR. 2]
Oh, it's not what I want.

428
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,137
It's what I have. Your ship!

429
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,138
[GROUP]
Stop joking!

430
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,739
I'm gonna kick your
butt for saying that!

431
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:21,473
Where are you?

432
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,709
On your ship, the Going Merry!

433
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,210
I shoulda kicked him harder!

434
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:29,248
[MR. 2]
Hey! Calm down! Please!

435
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:33,018
I mean, we are friends, right?
Right.

436
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,389
[laughing]

437
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,061
[LUFFY] He's at the upper
part of the Sandora River.

438
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,062
[SANJI]
Can we trust him?

439
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,664
We did become friends
that one time, but...

440
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,167
That was before we knew
he was part of Baroque Works!

441
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,102
I guess we have no choice.

442
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,670
[SANJI]
You're right. He has our ship.

443
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,172
If he tries to trick us,

444
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,673
I'll be more than happy
to kick the crap

445
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,507
out of him again.

446
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,742
[ZORO]
All right. We gotta move, guys.

447
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,379
[USOPP] Yeah, before he changes
the ship's figurehead to a swan!

448
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,081
Hey, you guys...

449
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,519
I, uh... I don't...

450
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,690
I don't know what to do.

451
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,126
If you were me,
what would you do?

452
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,631
[NAMI] Vivi, we can give you
twelve hours to make a decision.

453
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,433
We'll travel down the Sandora

454
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,536
after teaching Ballerina Boy
why he shouldn't steal from us

455
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,571
and by noon tomorrow,

456
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,439
we'll draw near
the eastern harbor.

457
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,541
I doubt we'll be able
to drop anchor, though.

458
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,110
If you do decide to join us,

459
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,579
that's gonna be the only
chance for you to come aboard.

460
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,481
Twelve o'clock, on the dot.

461
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,548
It's your choice.

462
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:40,052
You could stay a princess.]
or become a pirate.

463
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,620
[SANJI] I'm sure being
a pirate doesn't compare

464
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,223
to being a princess,
but we'd sure love to have you.

465
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,558
[LUFFY] Yeah, so why wait?
Come with us now, Vivi!

466
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,726
[USOPP]
Knock it off, Luffy.

467
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,294
‐‐[ZORO] Yeah, come on!
‐‐[LUFFY] Why?

468
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,063
Don't you guys
want her to join us?

469
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,132
[USOPP] We do, but that's
something she has to decide

470
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,466
for herself!

471
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,142
[VIVI]
Twelve o'clock on the dot.

472
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,177
If it's the eastern harbor,
it'll take four hours

473
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,578
to get there on Karoo.

474
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,481
If I left here by eight,
I'd make it on time.

475
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,483
Life as a pirate, huh?

476
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,385
Adventures on the
high seas surrounded

477
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,354
by loyal friends.

478
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,055
If I miss this chance,
I know I'll never get

479
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,358
another one like it
for the rest of my life.

480
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,197
On the other hand, I have
duties here as a princess.

481
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,032
And at a critical
time since this land's

482
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,567
in the midst of a rebirth.

483
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,406
Whatever I do choose,

484
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,275
you'll stay with me, won't you?

485
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,045
Say... Karoo?

486
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,683
What would you like to do?

487
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,685
[KAROO snoring]

488
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,686
[MR. 2]
Finally!

489
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,688
Long time no see, my friends!

490
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,024
Did you guys miss little ole me?

491
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,225
[ZORO]
Not a bit.

492
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,059
[SANJI]
Let's unload!

493
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,295
Later, ducks,
thanks for the lift!

494
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,564
[USOPP] Yeah! You ducks
take care of yourselves.

495
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,698
[ZORO]
Have a safe trip!

496
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,700
[LUFFY] Say bye to the
King, the old tube hair guy,

497
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,202
and all the others for us!

498
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,037
[USOPP]
So long, fellas!

499
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,739
Farewell!
May you ugly ducklings...

500
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,209
...turn into beautiful swans!

501
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,212
[crying]

502
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,146
Wait, hold on!

503
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,080
[SANJI]
Yeah, what?

504
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,048
Don't "yeah, what" me!
That's just rude!

505
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,150
You should learn
some manners, pretty boy!

506
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,551
Friends aren't supposed
to talk to their friends

507
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,485
that way!

508
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,753
Quit saying that, you weirdo!

509
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,222
We're not friends,
we're enemies!

510
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:23,822
You lied to us!

511
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,790
[MR. 2]
No, I didn't!

512
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,458
I just didn't mention
that I was a member

513
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,559
of Baroque Works!

514
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,429
Besides, none of that
really matters now does it?

515
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,397
Baroque works is done for now,

would've happened to it?

would have seized it.
