1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,783
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:41,619
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:45,924
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:51,362
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,396 --> 00:02:53,932
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,602
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,904
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:03,508
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,544
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:09,914
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,760
[RANDOM MARINE 385A] Bartholomew
Kuma has returned, sir!

48
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:35,073
This is a joke!

49
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:36,941
[SENGOKU] How is it
that even with your power,

50
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:39,944
you couldn't stop the
Straw Hats from escaping?

51
00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:42,513
I'm the one who has to
explain this to the top brass,

52
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:44,782
so your story
better be damn good!

53
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:49,887
That's my grandson for ya!

54
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:51,155
I don't want
to hear it, Garp!

55
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,826
You were ordered to exterminate
every pirate on Thriller Bark,

56
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,662
but you failed to even bring
back Straw Hat Luffy's head.

57
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,464
This is a disgrace!

58
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,700
Ah, don't worry
about it, Sengoku.

59
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,970
[GARP]
Sure, Luffy brought down Moria,

60
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:08,039
but he ain't gonna go
around blabbing about it.

61
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:09,841
Who would believe him anyway?

62
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:12,977
[scoffs]

63
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:15,513
[SENGOKU] I hope you didn't
take pity on those pirates

64
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:19,050
just because they
were injured, Kuma.

65
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,852
[SENGOKU]
Compassion is wasted on them.

66
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,121
It won't make them change
their course one bit.

67
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:24,522
And speaking of "course,"

68
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,424
if they keep following
their Log Pose,

69
00:04:26,457 --> 00:04:29,727
they'll be on the doorstep of
Navy Headquarters in no time!

70
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:34,999
[GARP]
Oh! Hey!

71
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:37,835
I got this fancy pants tea
I've been wanting to try!

72
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:39,003
Break out some crackers!

73
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:40,438
Go wait outside, Garp!

74
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:42,173
That's enough!

75
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:46,978
[LUFFY]
Halfway Across the Grand Line!

76
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:49,047
Arrival at the Red Line!

77
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:59,957
So what's the
big deal here, anyway?

78
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:01,793
[CHOPPER]
Hmm..

79
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:04,429
[USOPP]
Bad luck, I guess.

80
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:06,664
[BROOK]
Indeed.

81
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:12,236
[LUFFY] We haven't
caught a thing all day!

82
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,138
[CHOPPER]
It is kinda strange, huh?

83
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:16,908
[USOPP] It's annoying,
that's what it is.

84
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,644
[LUFFY]
Augh! I'm so bored!

85
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:22,547
[BROOK] I'm sure our luck
will turn around soon enough.

86
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:29,220
Nami, are we there yet?

87
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:32,657
I wanna be on
Fishman Island right now!

88
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,258
Could you shut up
for five minutes?

89
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,595
We're getting closer.
That's good enough, okay?

90
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,164
Fishmen. Mermaids!

91
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:46,604
Lovely, lovely mermaids!

92
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,872
Leap into my arms!

93
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:49,107
Or swim into my arms!

94
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,975
Or however that works!

95
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:55,012
Screw catching food.

96
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,981
I just wanna eat it!

97
00:05:57,014 --> 00:05:58,983
[LUFFY]
Sanji! Dinner!

98
00:06:00,952 --> 00:06:02,120
Hey, look!

99
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:06,891
[USOPP] There's a big
school of fish down there!

100
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:08,993
We finally hit the jackpot!

101
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:11,162
[BROOK]
See?

102
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:13,731
As they say, good things
come to those who wait!

103
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:15,299
[LUFFY chuckling]

104
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,235
I changed my mind!

105
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:19,771
[LUFFY] Whoa! They're
headed straight for us!

106
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,108
You wanna try, Nami?

107
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:25,109
What's wrong?

108
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:27,779
I'm not sure, but
something feels off here.

109
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,919
[LUFFY] Hey!
Get back here, fish!

110
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,256
Huh?

111
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:39,857
That looks bad.

112
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:48,966
You're kidding me.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,234
What is it?

114
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:53,871
Don't just make a scary face and
say foreboding things like that!

115
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:04,782
It's a Sea Snake Current!

116
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:06,984
Okay, but what is that?

117
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:08,719
[NAMI]
Brace yourselves!

118
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,367
[yelling]

119
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,268
The waves...

120
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:26,637
It looks like they're alive!

121
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:29,073
And I get why they're
called sea snakes.

122
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:34,011
Yohohoho!

123
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:35,379
This is quite the sight.

124
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,849
Awesome!

125
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,819
[NAMI]
Hey, Sanji!

126
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:43,955
Don't worry Nami,
I'm on it!

127
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:47,225
[SANJI straining]

128
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,826
[SANJI]
It won't budge!

129
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:09,747
Weapons Left!

130
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,849
Fire!

131
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:18,089
Hey, what are you
doing up there?

132
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,424
You forget how
to steer the ship?

133
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,693
[SANJI] Shut up!
It's not my fault!

134
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:24,795
Don't run into a lot of
snake-shaped tidal waves

135
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:26,030
in the kitchen!

136
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:30,935
Now Gum-Gum...

137
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,772
...Pistol!

138
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,645
[BROOK]
Yohohoho!

139
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:55,259
I trust no one is injured?

140
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:57,695
[CHOPPER]
Whoa, that was cool.

141
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,064
[BROOK] The term
"slippery as a snake"

142
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:03,100
certainly applies
to the current situation.

143
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:04,235
Current, you get it?

144
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:05,803
Because water?

145
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,338
Yohohoho!

146
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:08,139
Yeah, I get it!

147
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,207
Now stop laughing
and protect us!

148
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:15,346
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Gatling!

149
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:21,452
Star Shield, baby!

150
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:28,960
[ZORO] We gonna keep cutting
these things forever, or what?

151
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,766
Okay snakes,
time to go home now!

152
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,069
How are we gonna
get out of this mess?

153
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:42,106
Think we could fly outta
here with a Coup de Burst?

154
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:44,375
Oh, awesome!
I forgot about that!

155
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:45,910
[NAMI]
It won't work.

156
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,080
[NAMI] I can't see an end
to these currents.

157
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:51,182
In other words,

158
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,317
even if the Sunny
takes to the skies...

159
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,156
...there's no escape for us.

160
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,184
[CHOPPER]
No! Why?!

161
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,483
Yohohoho!

162
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:11,619
[BROOK] Shall I play
a song for everyone?

163
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,288
[BROOK]
In times like these,

164
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,490
one must remember that no
matter how terrible the storm,

165
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,159
it will eventually pass.

166
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:19,994
So I'll play some music
to see us through

167
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:22,163
and you can sing along.

168
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:23,364
Sounds good, Brook!

169
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:24,498
Let's do it!

170
00:10:24,532 --> 00:10:26,467
Yoho--augh!

171
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:31,272
Are we going up?

172
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:33,007
Oh, hell no.

173
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:36,978
[FRANKY]
We're falling!

174
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,014
Chopper!

175
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:44,385
[CHOPPER screaming]

176
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:53,394
I... thought I was done for.

177
00:11:06,474 --> 00:11:08,342
Hey, look!

178
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,543
No way!

179
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,318
I see it!

180
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:18,686
We're there!

181
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:23,290
[LUFFY]
It's the Red Line!

182
00:11:27,294 --> 00:11:29,096
It is the Red Line!

183
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:32,066
So we finally made it!

184
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:33,034
Remember?

185
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,436
There was a terrible
storm last time, too.

186
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:48,082
I'm going to the Grand Line
to search for the All Blue!

187
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:50,785
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

188
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:54,055
I'm gonna be
a master swordsman!

189
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,391
I'm going so I can draw
a map of the whole world!

190
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,592
And... And I guess I, uh,

191
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:01,762
well I guess I'm going to be
a brave warrior of the sea!

192
00:12:01,796 --> 00:12:03,264
[ALL]
Yeah!

193
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:05,499
To the Grand Line!

194
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:09,303
Hey!

195
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:11,272
I can see Mystery Mountain!

196
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:13,207
That's insanely huge!

197
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:16,710
Wow, the entrance
to the Grand Line.

198
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:18,813
[LUFFY]
Wow! Awesome!

199
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:20,414
It's bigger than I thought!

200
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,482
[USOPP]
I can't see the top!

201
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:23,584
It's taller than the clouds!

202
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:31,692
Hello, Red Line.

203
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:34,662
I've kept you waiting
for 50 years, haven't I?

204
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:37,164
Yohohoho!

205
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,502
We can do this, you guys!

206
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:45,539
Here it comes.

207
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,345
It's big!

208
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,548
You better steer
the ship right.

209
00:12:54,582 --> 00:12:57,318
[SANJI] And you better stop
running your damn mouth.

210
00:13:00,554 --> 00:13:02,456
Don't suppose we
could paddle our way out.

211
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,158
Even you're not that super.

212
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:04,792
[NAMI]
Go, Sanji!

213
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,460
Just try to ride the wave!

214
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,495
You got it!

215
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:09,230
Hey! Are you crazy?

216
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:10,231
Don't worry about it!

217
00:13:10,264 --> 00:13:12,133
We did the same thing
when we went to Skypeia,

218
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,135
and we turned out just fine!

219
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,204
Oh yeah, the
Knock-Up Stream, right?

220
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:20,107
Man, that sure was
fun, wasn't it?

221
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:20,841
How was that fun?

222
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:21,775
It was terrifying!

223
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:24,578
We survived that,
we can survive this too!

224
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,288
[LUFFY]
Let's go!

225
00:13:35,823 --> 00:13:38,726
All right, now a Coup
de Burst should do the trick!

226
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,195
Time to fly!
Pull in the sails!

227
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:45,733
[BROOK]
Yohoho!

228
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:47,301
You ready?

229
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:52,439
[FRANKY]
Coup De Burst!

230
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,884
[BROOK]
Yohohoho!

231
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,501
[CHOPPER]
We made it out!

232
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:23,404
[USOPP]
Yeah, well I wasn't scared.

233
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:25,839
[BROOK]
Yohohohoho!

234
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:29,577
[LUFFY]
We're here!

235
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,780
We're finally here!
We made it!

236
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:37,851
I can't even see
the top! It's huge!

237
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:41,188
So this is the Red Line.

238
00:14:41,222 --> 00:14:44,191
It's strange--
it feels sort of nostalgic.

239
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:46,160
I'm getting a bit choked up.

240
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,299
It hasn't been that long
since we last saw this,

241
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,668
but I feel like we've grown up.

242
00:14:54,702 --> 00:14:56,537
I can't seem to stop crying.

243
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,672
I guess a lot's happened, huh?

244
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:02,209
Anyway, we're halfway there!

245
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,545
[LUFFY] The Twin Capes
where we met Laboon

246
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:08,315
are connected to the Red Line
on the other side of the world.

247
00:15:08,349 --> 00:15:09,450
We've had some close calls,

248
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:12,786
but I'm glad we made it this far
without losing anybody.

249
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,787
When I was a baby,

250
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,390
I came to the South Blue
down Reverse Mountain,

251
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:18,659
but that was well
over 30 years ago.

252
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:21,228
The Red Line means a
lot more to me this time.

253
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:22,496
I came from the West Blue

254
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:26,533
to this ocean five years ago,
but it seems like forever now.

255
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:27,901
[LUFFY] If we keep
this up and sail around

256
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:29,103
the rest of the world,

257
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:33,240
we'll come to this wall one
more time, and when we do...

258
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:38,562
Then I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

259
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,293
[NAMI] We have to be extra
careful from here on out.

260
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,796
We're right next to the
Holy Land of Mariejois,

261
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,632
home of Navy Headquarters
and the World Government.

262
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,502
[CHOPPER laughing]

263
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,978
[CHOPPER] How'd we ever live
without a swimming pool?

264
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,478
I'm still too weak.

265
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,446
Why don't you have a taste?

266
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,624
[SANJI] Hey!
Are you still alive?

267
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,426
Where'd that paw guy go?

268
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,595
What in the hell happened here?

269
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,632
What happened here?

270
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,367
Nothing at all.

271
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,538
I won't be powerless again.

272
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,109
[ZORO] I won't
let myself be weak.

273
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,713
I won't fail my crew.

274
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,753
[NAMI] Okay Robin, Brook,
Luffy, do you see anything?

275
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,824
[ROBIN] No use.
It's pitch black.

276
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,092
[LUFFY laughing]

277
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,760
[LUFFY]
Yep! Pitch black!

278
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,461
Wait, no.

279
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:43,829
I think I just saw something.

280
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:44,963
[BROOK screaming]

281
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,065
[BROOK]
A monster!

282
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:49,101
Its eyes were
glowing in the dark!

283
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,636
Did he say "monster?"

284
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,538
[BROOK]
We're gonna die!

285
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,647
[BROOK]
Though I suppose...

286
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,148
...I'm already dead, aren't I?

287
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,018
Yohohoho!

288
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,922
[BROOK]
Oh, that reminds me, Nami.

289
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,690
I have a dying request.

290
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,626
[BROOK] Would you be
so kind as to tell me

291
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,762
what kind of panties
you're wearing?

292
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:21,633
You want a monster?
I'll show you one!

293
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,035
[CHOPPER]
Scary!

294
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,805
[USOPP] For a skeleton,
he sure has guts.

295
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,943
[FRANKY] Shark Submerge 3
has a max depth of 5000 meters,

296
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,846
so be careful you don't get
yourself in trouble down there!

297
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:37,950
That's odd.

298
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,120
I don't imagine it's supposed to
make that horrid creaking noise.

299
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,822
Oh, no. That's bad.

300
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,025
I'm afraid we already
passed 5000 meters.

301
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,628
Ah. That makes sense.

302
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,029
Oh... Wait, that is bad!

303
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,764
The water pressure is going
to crush the submarine

304
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,099
like a tin can!

305
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,171
[LUFFY]
Hey, it's that monster again.

306
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,140
I think he likes us.

307
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,809
[ROBIN]
My, what big teeth he has!

308
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,645
[LUFFY]
That was rude!

309
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,114
He thinks we're food!

310
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,215
[BROOK]
Here it comes again!

311
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:15,487
[LUFFY laughing]

312
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,789
So are they in trouble, or not?

313
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,925
I don't think
I ever want to ride

314
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,493
in Shark Submerge 3.

315
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,728
No kidding.

316
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,963
[SANJI]
Nami swan!

317
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,233
I made a nice tart with horror
pears I found on Thriller Bark!

318
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,803
It sounds scary,
but I promise it's yummy!

319
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,605
[NAMI] Ooh!
I can't wait to try it!

320
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,806
[BROOK screaming]

321
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,708
[BROOK]
Look, it's behind us!

322
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:40,646
[LUFFY] Whoa, it's
gonna eat us! Cool!

323
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,714
This really is a mess, huh?

324
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,084
That's yummy!

325
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,788
--So good!
--So good!

326
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,156
I thought we knew
where we were going,

327
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,659
but it's like Skypeia all over.

328
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,960
No kidding.

329
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,030
[NAMI] Even if we know
which direction to go,

330
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,899
that doesn't tell us
how to get there.

331
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,035
Gimme a break,
Fishman Island.

332
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,636
Where are you?

333
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:09,741
[LUFFY]
We're back!

334
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,544
[BROOK] Yohoho!
My, was that ever fun!

335
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,883
Nice job staying
alive, you guys!

336
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,284
For all the good it did me.

337
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,186
I couldn't see
a thing down there.

338
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,722
Are you sure this is
where Fishman Island's at?

339
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:24,656
Yohohoho!

340
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,292
No loss for me--
I'd gladly do that again!

341
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,293
We'd have gone further down,

342
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,963
but the water pressure
would have crushed us.

343
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,030
I don't know
what else to do.

344
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,866
The Log Pose is definitely
pointing straight down.

345
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,934
What a pain.

346
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:36,902
It's too late now,

347
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,571
but I should've asked
Lola how this works.

348
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,581
Whoa! It's the monster!

349
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,084
It followed us!

350
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,728
Ha! If you think you can
beat me out of the water,

351
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,063
you're in for a surprise.

352
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,100
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Rifle!

353
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,172
You know what?

354
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,074
It doesn't seem all that big.

355
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,843
We did just fight Oars.

356
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,045
Now everything's
gonna seem small!

357
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,584
Hey! Something
flew out of its mouth.

358
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,823
A fish?

359
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,892
[FEMALE screaming]

360
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,827
A girl? Huh?

361
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,198
Wait, is that...

362
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,099
I think so.

363
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,068
[FEMALE screaming]

364
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,104
Oh, hell yes!

365
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,250
I made it!

366
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,594
You saved us!

367
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,699
Wow, that was a lotta fun!

368
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,334
Oh yeah, that was a blast!

369
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,702
In fact, I had so much fun,

370
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,270
I'm gonna jump right
back in his mouth!

371
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,339
Now do you wanna tell me
why you didn't run away

372
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,674
from that thing
when you saw it?

373
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,675
Well, that's the thing.

374
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,043
I kinda didn't see it.

375
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,078
[CREATURE]
Of course not!

376
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,213
It's not like it was
freakin huge or anything!

377
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:31,316
Maybe you haven't noticed,

378
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,785
but you got a little something
under your tail there.

379
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:38,757
I crushed a human,
oh nooooo!

380
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,425
I-I'm sorry!

381
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,360
Are you okay?

382
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,227
[SANJI]
Okay?

383
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,029
Course I'm okay--
never been better!

384
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,931
Anyway, how are you doing?

385
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,143
[MERMAID]
Pull yourself together!

386
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,945
--Did I hurt you?
--That's a tail.

387
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,347
[MERMAID] He must have hit his
head! He's acting weird.

388
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,282
[USOPP]
With fins.

389
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,853
[NAMI] Then,
that means... she's a...

390
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,825
[ALL]
A mermaid?

391
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,833
[MERMAID] Please, help me!
Save my friend Hatchin!

392
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,101
[LUFFY]
You got it!

393
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,170
Should we start with that guy
in the mask and kick his ass?

394
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,071
[MERMAID]
That's Duval,

395
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,906
the leader of the
Flying Fish Riders.

396
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:31,276
[DUVAL] I'm tired of waiting.
I'm gonna kill you!

397
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,879
You're the one
who ruined my life!

398
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,313
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

399
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,182
"He Hates the Straw Hat Crew!

400
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,885
Iron Mask Duval
Makes His Appearance!"

401
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,287
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
