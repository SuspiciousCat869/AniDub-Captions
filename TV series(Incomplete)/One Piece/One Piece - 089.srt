00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,369
We've been tracking him forever,
and he still hasn't shown up.

173
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,205
He's not interested
in becoming a pirate...

174
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,840
You're just going to
have to accept that.

175
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,341
No, that's not true!

176
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,677
I want the reindeer
to be a pirate with us!

177
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,412
Just because you
want something doesn't mean

178
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,380
it's going to happen...

179
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,683
[CHOPPER] It's not that
I don't want to go with them...

180
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,319
Reindeer!

181
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,555
Wherever you are, reindeer,
come out! Just for a second.

182
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,358
[CHOPPER] But I'm not
going to go! I can't go!

183
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,928
I'm nothing like
them‐‐the humans.

184
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,870
[LUFFY]
Reindeer guy...

185
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,371
[BOTH grunt]

186
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,539
[LUFFY chuckles]

187
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,544
Tony?

188
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,782
Hey, you're gonna
come on our ship and be

189
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,685
a pirate with us! 'Kay?

190
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,686
[CHOPPER]
I can't.

191
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,523
Sure you can, reindeer!
It's a whole lot of fun!

192
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,391
[USOPP] That's not
a very good argument...

193
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,960
[CHOPPER]
I can't.

194
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,864
I'm not a human...

195
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:56,402
I'm a reindeer! I have antlers
and hooves, don't you see?!

196
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,404
I even have a blue nose!

197
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,374
[KUREHA] Now that
you've heard his story,

198
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,876
do you think you can heal
the scar on his heart?

199
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,914
Okay... Maybe I do want to be...

200
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:12,785
...a pirate. But I can't
ever be one of you.

201
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:16,322
I'm not human! I'm a monster!
I can't be your friend,

202
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,626
and I can't become a pirate
on your ship! You see?

203
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,298
I'm just here to say thank you.

204
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,467
I appreciate you asking
me to join your ship...

205
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,337
That was really nice...
so thank you.

206
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,476
[CHOPPER] I'm going
to stay here for now...

207
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,449
But if you wanted to,
you could stop by here again.

208
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:47,753
[LUFFY]
Shut up! Let's go!

209
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,988
[CHOPPER gasps]

210
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,860
[NAMI chuckles]

211
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,701
Most people don't make friends
by telling someone to shut up.

212
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:08,207
[CHOPPER whimpers, sobs]

213
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,900
[USOPP]
Nami... How ya feeling?

214
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,204
Are you completely recovered
from your illness already?

215
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:41,073
[NAMI]
Sure am... I feel great!

216
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,510
[LUFFY] Hey! How bout we go say
goodbye to the old doctor lady

217
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,012
and that Dalton guy
from the village.

218
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,213
[NAMI]
Don't be so thoughtless!

219
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,882
We need to leave Chopper alone
with Doctorine for awhile.

220
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,684
He lived with her for six years.

221
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,486
We should let them
say goodbye in peace...

222
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,888
I'm sure it's gonna be
really sad for them both.

223
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,090
Doctorine acts all
tough in front of us,

224
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,993
but deep down, I think she
really is a kind person.

225
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,928
[LUFFY]
Hmm... You sure?

226
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,730
[USOPP] So... we're
just gonna leave without

227
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,198
saying anything to her?

228
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,199
[NAMI]
Yeah, that's right...

229
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,934
Once Chopper comes back,
we'll go straight down

230
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,505
the mountain and
set sail... to Alabasta!

231
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,707
Sounds good to you, right, Vivi?

232
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,109
Yes... Now that we have
a doctor coming with us.

233
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,244
[LUFFY]
Doctor?

234
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,612
Well... In that case...

235
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,714
I'll go ahead and get
the ropeway ready.

236
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,582
[USOPP]
Hey, Luffy! Give me a hand.

237
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,018
[LUFFY] I didn't even know
there was a ropeway!

238
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,054
So cool...

239
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:35,027
[VILLAGERS gruntin]

240
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,229
[KUREHA] Now, hurry up
and get them out of here...

241
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,931
Once they're all
outside the castle,

242
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,100
line them up! You got that?

243
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,936
[VILLAGER A]
Doctor Kureha?

244
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:44,937
[KUREHA]
Hm?

245
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,205
I don't understand this.

246
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,241
What are we taking all of these
canons out of the arsenal for?

247
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,944
[KUREHA chuckles]
Just hurry up and get it done.

248
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,546
Uh... But I...

249
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,290
[KUREHA]
Well, look at that...

250
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,159
It seems as if we have
a couple of patients missing.

251
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,662
Yes, they all left...

252
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,630
Directly disobeying your orders.

253
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,901
Oh, I see... What am I
going to do with them?

254
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,245
[CHOPPER]
Doctorine!

255
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,749
[CHOPPER]
Doctorine!

256
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,086
I need to talk to you right now!

257
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,821
[KUREHA] Chopper, where
have you been all day?

258
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,623
Hurry up and get downstairs...

259
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,959
You can help the men
take the cannons outside.

260
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,627
Please listen, Doctorine...

261
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,129
I'm going to become a pirate...

262
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,197
I'm leaving with
the others right now!

263
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,632
What did you say?

264
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,033
[CHOPPER]
I'm going out to sea!

265
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,669
I'm coming on board with
them as the ship's doctor.

266
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,338
I'm going to travel everywhere!

267
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,140
Stop this foolishness, Chopper!

268
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,174
[CHOPPER gasps]

269
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,208
[KUREHA]
Now, listen...

270
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,711
You know you're
my only assistant!

271
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,012
I'm the one who
taught you everything

272
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,981
you know about medicine!

273
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,049
Do you really feel
no gratitude at all

274
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,351
for what I've done?

275
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,686
No... No, that isn't true!

276
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,156
I'm incredibly grateful
to you, Doctorine!

277
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,124
And I'll always love this land!

278
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,693
It's where I met you
and Doctor, after all.

279
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,996
[KUREHA] Hmph. Then
you can just stay here!

280
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,165
If you think you can find
another home as nice as this one

281
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,635
somewhere in the outside
world, you're sadly mistaken.

282
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,702
[CHOPPER gasps]

283
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,038
Those pirates aren't
good for anything, Chopper!

284
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,008
You'll end up dead on some
vagabond's sword in no time!

285
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,242
[CHOPPER]
I can accept that!

286
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,646
[KUREHA]
Don't sound so sure of yourself!

287
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,814
A reindeer going out to sea?

288
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,049
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard of...

289
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,752
Yeah, I am a
reindeer! But, still!

290
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,853
I'm a man!

291
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:41,987
[KUREHA growls]

292
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,724
[CHOPPER growls]

293
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,828
You can talk tough for now...

294
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,831
But you're still my assistant,
Chopper! If you want to leave,

295
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,399
you're going to have
to go through me first!

296
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,733
Do you understand?

297
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,002
[gasps]
Doctorine, I...

298
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,840
[yells]

299
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,274
[KUREHA] You're still
afraid of your own shadow,

300
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,844
and you're telling
me you're a man?

301
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,213
Oh, please,
don't make me laugh...

302
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,850
But, Doctorine...
These pirates, don't you see...

303
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:15,354
[LUFFY]
Shut up! Let's go!

304
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,755
They like me.

305
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,357
Quiet, you!

306
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,925
[CHOPPER grunts]

307
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,961
No, I'm not gonna
let you leave me...

308
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,232
[CHOPPER squeals]

309
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,267
[KUREHA]
You're staying!

310
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,803
[CHOPPER screams]

311
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,239
[KUREHA]
Get back here, Chopper!

312
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,307
[CHOPPER screams]

313
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,109
[KUREHA]
You can't escape!

314
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,144
[CHOPPER screams]

315
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,946
I wonder what
all that noise is about.

316
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,048
[VILLAGER C] Who knows?
Whatever's going on,

317
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,317
we'd better hurry and get
all this stuff outside...

318
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,219
If we aren't careful,
Dr. Kureha will start

319
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,255
using us for target practice.

320
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,890
Don't exaggerate.

321
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,324
[KUREHA]
Come back!

322
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,425
[CHOPPER screams]

323
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,294
[KUREHA] I won't let you
get away from me! Chopper!

324
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,096
[CHOPPER sobs]

325
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,064
[KUREHA]
Give up!

326
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:01,901
[ZORO]
What's going on?

327
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,836
There's a lot of noise
coming from the castle.

328
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,137
[NAMI]
How inconsiderate...

329
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,973
Making all that noise when those
two are trying to say goodbye...

330
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,775
That's just downright rude!

331
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,847
[CHOPPER] I'm sorry, Doctorine,
but I want to go out and see

332
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,849
the world beyond this island!

333
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,322
[KUREHA]
What could someone like you do

334
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,157
on a pirate ship, Chopper?

335
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,859
Are you gonna
try to live some fantasy

336
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,794
like that old quack?

337
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,332
[CHOPPER] No... You're wrong!
It wasn't a fantasy!

338
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,002
Doctor's research was finally
completed before he died!

339
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,837
Oh, finally here he comes...

340
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,005

were riding in the sleigh...
