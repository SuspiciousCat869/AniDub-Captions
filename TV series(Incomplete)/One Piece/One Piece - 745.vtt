00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:37.448
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.187
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:45.497
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.936
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.309
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.213
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:55.417
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:58.591
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.532
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.632 --> 00:03:04.335
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:08.276
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:12.585
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:16.961
[NARRATOR]
After a fierce struggle,

00:03:17.061 --> 00:03:19.031
Luffy and his allies
defeated the Warlord,

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:20.668
Don Quixote Doflamingo,

00:03:20.768 --> 00:03:22.705
and rushed to leave
the island of Dressrosa

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:25.310
before Admiral Fujitora
could capture them.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.792
I'm sorry to say,
there are only criminals ahead.

00:03:32.892 --> 00:03:35.063
You fine people are making
a terrible mistake

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:36.365
by coming here.

00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:38.704
[TOWNSMAN F] You better
prepare yourself, Lucy!

00:03:38.804 --> 00:03:40.608
[TOWNSMAN G]
Don't let 'em escape!

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:43.547
[TOWNSMAN H] You're gonna
pay for this! Damn pirates!

00:03:44.414 --> 00:03:46.119
[TOWNSMAN J]
Lucy!

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.456
[TOWNSMAN K]
We're gonna get you!

00:03:48.557 --> 00:03:51.663
[TOWNSMAN J] Get the ships!
Chase him out to sea!

00:03:51.763 --> 00:03:53.600
[TOWNSMAN P]
If we stick close to Lucy,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.472
Fujitora won't be able to
drop the rubble from the sky!

00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:59.613
A force of 5,600 total!

00:03:59.713 --> 00:04:03.353
Mister Luffy, exchange cups
with the leaders of each crew!

00:04:03.453 --> 00:04:05.758
We'll drink ritual saké
as father and son!

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.196
'Kay, how does that work?

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:10.166
[BARTOLOMEO] In a crew,
the boss is the father

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:11.970
and his men are the sons!

00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:13.841
As leader of the
Straw Hat Pirates,

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:16.312
we humbly ask you to
take us under your wing.

00:04:16.412 --> 00:04:17.815
So, do you accept?

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.404
[LUFFY] "Sons' Cups!
The Straw Hat Fleet is Formed!"

00:04:34.516 --> 00:04:36.953
I am gonna murder you!

00:04:37.053 --> 00:04:39.692
All our work with
Doflamingo is screwed,

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:42.230
thanks to your
meddling, Straw Hat!

00:04:42.798 --> 00:04:45.069
[PIRATE B] Don't let him
escape Dressrosa alive!

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.840
And what about King Riku?

00:04:46.941 --> 00:04:49.880
If he's back, our business
is gonna suffer for it!

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.320
We'll kill Straw Hat
and all his pals, too.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.490
There'll be no one
left to stop us!

00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:59.098
After that, Dressrosa
will be our playground!

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:02.070
[PIRATE A] All right!
We'll form an alliance!

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.279
A fleet of pirates, united by
our hatred of Straw Hat!

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.853
No mercy! No escape!
Take his head!

00:05:09.953 --> 00:05:12.457
[PIRATES cheer]

00:05:19.672 --> 00:05:22.244
Now, bring me the saké!

00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:23.112
I'm on it.

00:05:36.472 --> 00:05:37.808
Thanks.

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:38.710
Thank you.

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.025
[BARTOLOMEO]
'Kay. All set over here.

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:47.027
The boss is next.

00:05:57.247 --> 00:05:59.753
[BARTOLOMEO] Let us exchange
the vows of father and son

00:05:59.853 --> 00:06:02.157
with Mister Luffy
as our new boss

00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:04.729
and us as his followers. Uh--

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:09.071
[BARTOLOMEO] You gotta
drink it, Mister Luffy.

00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:14.014
Nah. I think I'll pass.

00:06:14.114 --> 00:06:14.816
[ALL]
Huh?!

00:06:17.254 --> 00:06:18.924
[USOPP]
Mm-hmm!

00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:19.859
Go figure.

00:06:21.128 --> 00:06:23.032
I'm not into saké.

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:25.872
No. It's not for taste,
it's a vow!

00:06:25.972 --> 00:06:29.144
And listen. You're gonna be
famous after this whole thing.

00:06:29.244 --> 00:06:32.417
Meaning, a bunch of bad dudes
are gonna wanna tryda kill ya!

00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:34.454
It doesn't matter
how strong you are!

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:36.325
Nobody can win
against numbers like that!

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:37.728
You need backup!

00:06:37.828 --> 00:06:39.332
That's where we come in!

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:41.436
You saved us, so we'll save you!

00:06:41.537 --> 00:06:43.373
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

00:06:43.473 --> 00:06:46.245
Yeah, but if I drink this stuff,

00:06:46.345 --> 00:06:50.486
I'll be the big captain guy
of some grand fleet, right?

00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:55.230
Uh, yeah. With 5,600 followers,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.169
you'd be one of the most
impressive pirates on the seas.

00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:02.579
I mean, you're gonna be
King of the Pirates eventually,

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:04.214
no doubt about it.

00:07:04.314 --> 00:07:07.153
But it's a big world,
so if you wanna conquer it,

00:07:07.253 --> 00:07:08.557
then you gotta think big!

00:07:08.857 --> 00:07:10.995
[ZORO]
He doesn't care. Give it up.

00:07:11.863 --> 00:07:13.834
You're wasting your time.

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:14.803
Huh?

00:07:14.903 --> 00:07:18.342
So. Put this in a beer mug.

00:07:18.442 --> 00:07:19.779
I'll drink it.

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:22.885
I said it's not for taste,
it's for a vow!

00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:24.756
[ORLUMBUS]
Why, Straw Hat?

00:07:24.857 --> 00:07:28.029
A massive military force
could be at your command!

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:31.169
The men who stand before you
are all mighty warriors,

00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:34.041
and yet we would have been
undone without your help.

00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:37.515
Someday, you'll find yourself
in the same situation!

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:39.151
Not my style!

00:07:39.251 --> 00:07:41.956
[ALL]
Huh? What's with that look?

00:07:44.294 --> 00:07:47.067
Anyway. Are people
getting ready for a party,

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:48.402
'cause I smell food!

00:07:48.503 --> 00:07:50.508
That's great.
Just change the subject.

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:52.344
You're pissing me off,
Straw Hat!

00:07:52.444 --> 00:07:55.017
Listen, you should be
grateful that a star like me

00:07:55.117 --> 00:07:56.854
is willing to fly
under your flag!

00:07:56.954 --> 00:07:58.557
Let's force him to drink it!

00:07:58.657 --> 00:08:00.493
I know you saved us,

00:08:00.594 --> 00:08:02.799
but we're strong enough
to kick your ass!

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:05.637
I thought he was the boss!
Don't be so rude!

00:08:05.738 --> 00:08:07.007
[IDEO]
You gonna make me?

00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:09.045
[SAI]
Yeah, wanna fight about it?

00:08:09.145 --> 00:08:10.146
[USOPP]
No, sir.

00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:11.482
Here's the thing.

00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:13.921
I want to be the
King of the Pirates.

00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:16.158
I don't need to be
some big shot!

00:08:22.404 --> 00:08:25.143
Huh? Even for him, that's dumb.

00:08:27.047 --> 00:08:29.753
Damn! That's good stuff!
Knew it!

00:08:29.853 --> 00:08:31.990
Use a cup! That's so gross!

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.129
Oooh! Me next!
I want some, too!

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:36.465
No!

00:08:36.733 --> 00:08:39.438
[ROBIN chuckles] I could
go for a cup, myself.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:41.375
Fine! Me, too!

00:08:41.475 --> 00:08:42.645
[FRANKY]
Damn, it is good!

00:08:42.745 --> 00:08:43.981
[ZORO]
Told you.

00:08:44.081 --> 00:08:46.986
Mister Luffy, are we
not good enough?

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:51.229
[LUFFY]
How 'bout this?

00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:54.267
If I'm ever in trouble,
I'll call you guys for help.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.905
And I know you'll save me,

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:58.410
'cause that's what friends do
for each other, right?

00:08:58.511 --> 00:09:02.217
I don't have to be a big shot
or have a whole fleet for that.

00:09:02.317 --> 00:09:04.856
And if you're ever
in trouble, call us.

00:09:04.956 --> 00:09:07.260
I'm happy to help, any time!

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.599
I couldn'tve beat Mingo
without you guys,

00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:11.636
so we're friends for life!

00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:30.942
You know.

00:09:31.042 --> 00:09:33.814
It took a second,
but I get it now.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.886
And I think I understand
what it means

00:09:36.986 --> 00:09:39.391
for you to be
King of the Pirates.

00:09:40.093 --> 00:09:44.067
It's not about bein' big,
but bein' free!

00:09:45.505 --> 00:09:46.906
[gasps] What was that?

00:09:47.006 --> 00:09:48.643
[YONTAMARIA FLEET gasps]

00:09:48.743 --> 00:09:49.812
[YONTAMARIA PIRATE A]
Cannon fire!

00:09:49.912 --> 00:09:50.982
[ORLUMBUS]
Is it the Navy?

00:09:51.082 --> 00:09:53.253
Can't be! They're all stuck!

00:09:53.353 --> 00:09:55.724
I sewed their ships
together extra tight!

00:09:57.227 --> 00:09:59.097
Fire! Fire!

00:10:06.813 --> 00:10:08.984
Columbus can take
care of this one!

00:10:09.085 --> 00:10:11.790
Sorry, but we're
still busy here.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.660
Whoever it is, take 'em out!

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.229
Sir!

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.467
[PIRATE A] I know you have
Straw Hat on your ship!

00:10:17.568 --> 00:10:19.972
Hand him over or pay the price!

00:10:20.072 --> 00:10:22.410
You don't want to defy us!

00:10:28.422 --> 00:10:29.826
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:10:29.926 --> 00:10:31.129
[YONTAMARIA PIRATE C]
People of Dressrosa.

00:10:31.229 --> 00:10:33.500
Get back on land!
It's dangerous!

00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:36.873
[TOWNSMAN A] But if we leave,
Fujitora might attack Lucy!

00:10:36.973 --> 00:10:38.844
[YONTAMARIA PIRATE D]
Return fire!

00:10:47.928 --> 00:10:50.399
Fire! Let 'em sink!

00:11:00.053 --> 00:11:04.695
[PIRATES gasping]

00:11:14.314 --> 00:11:15.984
[YONTAMARIA PIRATE E gasps]
Look!

00:11:16.085 --> 00:11:17.353
The rubble's raining down
on the enemy ships!

00:11:17.453 --> 00:11:18.422
[YONTAMARIA PIRATE F]
But not us?

00:11:34.354 --> 00:11:40.466
[PIRATES screaming]

00:11:46.212 --> 00:11:49.719
This is my parting gift,
Straw Hat.

00:11:56.165 --> 00:12:01.342
Freedom. Right. That's all
Mister Luffy wants.

00:12:01.442 --> 00:12:04.850
It's beautiful.
He's the greatest.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.087
I love him even more!

00:12:07.187 --> 00:12:09.291
[sobs]

00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:15.369
[laughs] You know what?
Let's do the oath.

00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:17.040
Because we want to.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.912
It doesn't matter if Straw Hat
won't drink with us.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.052
He makes a good point.

00:12:24.956 --> 00:12:28.229
Heh. If you can do
what you want, so can we.

00:12:28.329 --> 00:12:32.036
You wanna talk about freedom?
Well, we have it, too!

00:12:32.738 --> 00:12:34.107
I didn't think of that!

00:12:49.137 --> 00:12:52.377
Mister Luffy,
I'll raise this saké cup

00:12:52.477 --> 00:12:54.916
and offer up an oath
along with it.

00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:57.053
Huh? An oath?

00:12:57.153 --> 00:12:59.825
[BARTOLOMEO]
All right. Here goes.

00:13:00.994 --> 00:13:03.065
[BARTOLOMEO]
We'll become the proud followers

00:13:03.165 --> 00:13:05.036
of Straw Hat Luffy.

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:07.575
Therefore, in rain or in shine,

00:13:07.675 --> 00:13:10.714
we shall serve as his
sword and his shield.

00:13:10.814 --> 00:13:12.619
To repay our debt to him,

00:13:12.719 --> 00:13:16.626
the seven of us offer our
loyalty of our own accord.

00:13:16.726 --> 00:13:18.262
As we drink these cups,

00:13:18.362 --> 00:13:21.602
let us pledge both our lives
and our hearts alike.

00:13:23.974 --> 00:13:25.944
Hey! That's cheating!

00:13:32.524 --> 00:13:33.258
[gasps]

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.308

00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:45.216

00:14:15.009 --> 00:14:16.244
[gasps]

00:14:16.344 --> 00:14:18.884
[crying]

00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:21.054
I didn't say you guys
could do that!

00:14:21.154 --> 00:14:22.056
[YONTAMARIA FLEET cheers]

00:14:22.156 --> 00:14:23.827
Guess it's official now!

00:14:23.927 --> 00:14:27.133
[YONTAMARIA PIRATE H] Then get
this party started already!

00:14:27.801 --> 00:14:29.906
[YONTAMARIA FLEET]
I thought you'd never ask!

00:14:30.006 --> 00:14:31.274
[YONTAMARIA PIRATE I]
Let us feast in honor of

00:14:31.374 --> 00:14:35.382
the Straw Hat Fleet,
5,600 strong!

00:14:35.483 --> 00:14:37.822
[YONTAMARIA FLEET]
Yeah!

00:14:37.922 --> 00:14:39.290
How underhanded!

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.531
[FRANKY laughs]
They just do what they want!

00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:43.967
I like their style!

00:14:44.067 --> 00:14:45.738
[YONTAMARIA FLEET]
Lookin' good, big boss!

00:14:45.838 --> 00:14:47.708
Can't wait to work with you!

00:14:47.809 --> 00:14:52.685
[LUFFY] What? Hey!
I did not drink this stuff!

00:14:53.286 --> 00:14:55.891
I know the cup's empty,
but that's not on me!

00:14:55.991 --> 00:14:56.893
[ZORO chuckles]

00:14:56.993 --> 00:14:58.964
Yeah, we don't care.

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:01.970
I won't bother trying
to force your hand,

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:03.874
but we can still
swear our loyalty to you,

00:15:03.974 --> 00:15:06.211
whether you like it or not.

00:15:06.311 --> 00:15:07.848
That means,
when you're in trouble,

00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:09.417
we'll come running.

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:11.155
If you have friends
who are willing to do that

00:15:11.255 --> 00:15:14.027
for nothing in return,
you should be grateful.

00:15:14.127 --> 00:15:16.298
All we ask is that you engrave

00:15:16.398 --> 00:15:18.770
our names and faces
on your heart.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.406
[BABY 5]
Hey, honey.

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:23.345
--He's gone.
--[SAI gasps]

00:15:23.445 --> 00:15:26.051
[USOPP] Look at the main course!
It's a fighting fish steak!

00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:27.621
[LUFFY]
Gimme somma that!

00:15:27.722 --> 00:15:30.059
[USOPP] Don't climb on food!
That's unhygienic!

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:32.430
[IDEO]
Would you stop crying already?

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:35.871
I was so touched by his words,
I may never stop!

00:15:35.971 --> 00:15:38.208
Just leave me to my tears!

00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:40.881
Leo. I think we're
all about to leave the port.

00:15:40.981 --> 00:15:42.685
Will you stay and eat?

00:15:42.785 --> 00:15:45.222
[LEO] There's no way
we'd miss the banquet!

00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:47.829
We can take the Yellow Cubs
back to Dressrosa!

00:15:47.929 --> 00:15:49.464
Don't worry about us!

00:15:50.299 --> 00:15:51.736
Are we setting sail now?

00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:54.642
Right! The boss says time to go!

00:15:54.742 --> 00:15:55.811
Hoist the sails!

00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:57.681
[YONTAMARIA FLEET cheers]

00:15:57.781 --> 00:16:00.987
I didn't say that!
And I'm not your boss!

00:16:16.485 --> 00:16:19.157
[MARINE A] Vice Admiral
Bastille! I have a report!

00:16:19.257 --> 00:16:21.094
[BASTILLE] I see the
rubble raining down.

00:16:21.194 --> 00:16:23.365
Did it wipe out Straw Hat
and his friends?

00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:25.570
[MARINE A] No,
it's missing all the targets!

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.375
You gotta be kidding me!

00:16:37.528 --> 00:16:39.464
[NARRATOR] That day,
Dressrosa experienced

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:41.703
some very unusual
weather conditions.

00:16:41.803 --> 00:16:44.375
But in the end,
their heavy downpour of rubble

00:16:44.475 --> 00:16:46.546
gradually gave way
to sunny skies.

00:16:50.921 --> 00:16:52.958
[FUJITORA] Truth be told,
I had no right to

00:16:53.058 --> 00:16:55.496
chase you down
in the first place.

00:16:57.233 --> 00:16:59.304
[FUJITORA] Also,
though I probably shouldn't

00:16:59.404 --> 00:17:02.410
say this out loud,
you really did clean up

00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:05.250
the Government's mess
here in Dressrosa.

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:09.324
And for your courage,
you have my eternal gratitude.

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:15.169
I heard that.

00:17:16.806 --> 00:17:19.512
[SENGOKU chuckles]

00:17:19.612 --> 00:17:22.416
[LUFFY] All right, guys!
Let's raise our cups!

00:17:25.122 --> 00:17:28.296
Our team kicked
the Mingo Family's ass!

00:17:28.396 --> 00:17:33.640
So here's to us and to victory!

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.347
[ALL cheer]

00:17:37.447 --> 00:17:39.217
[FRANKY]
Super!

00:17:39.317 --> 00:17:42.023
Let's party!

00:17:42.123 --> 00:17:44.060
You guys were awesome!

00:17:44.595 --> 00:17:46.766
[DWARVES]
Thanks, Fraland!

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:48.836
Zoroland, you're the best!

00:17:48.936 --> 00:17:50.105
Duh!

00:17:52.611 --> 00:17:53.445
Rooster!

00:17:55.082 --> 00:17:58.188
Mister Luffy!

00:18:00.928 --> 00:18:02.798
Honey!

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.069
Make a toast!

00:18:05.169 --> 00:18:06.071
'Kay!

00:18:06.171 --> 00:18:07.674
[BOTH]
To us!

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:09.878
[DWARVES cheer]

00:18:09.979 --> 00:18:14.220
[laughing]

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.602
Dressrosa, here we come!

00:18:25.109 --> 00:18:27.814
[SANJI, FRANKY, LUFFY]
Smells good!

00:18:33.492 --> 00:18:36.231
I want it! That fruit
should be mine!

00:18:37.568 --> 00:18:39.137
I wound up wearing the same

00:18:39.238 --> 00:18:41.676
fighting costume
as this old guy.

00:18:41.776 --> 00:18:44.549
But I gotta admit,
it does look cool.

00:18:44.649 --> 00:18:46.184
And super manly!

00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:55.804
[LUFFY]
I'll tell you what I think.

00:18:55.904 --> 00:18:58.743
You're never getting Ace's
power, as long as I live.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.156
[LUFFY]
Whatever the old king did,

00:19:05.256 --> 00:19:06.626
even if she is
his granddaughter,

00:19:06.726 --> 00:19:08.462
it had nothing to do with her!

00:19:08.563 --> 00:19:11.268
Franky! Kick some ass out there!

00:19:11.368 --> 00:19:12.938
We'll back you up real soon!

00:19:18.517 --> 00:19:20.219
[LUFFY]
Can't start crying yet.

00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:23.259
I won't let the solider die.
Be strong, okay?

00:19:23.359 --> 00:19:25.029
Don't worry!

00:19:25.129 --> 00:19:29.103
I promise I'll give Doflamingo
the beating of his life for you!

00:19:29.203 --> 00:19:31.909
So stay safe! You hear me?

00:19:37.922 --> 00:19:40.192
[LUFFY] I'm here to
whoop your sorry butt!

00:19:48.609 --> 00:19:52.618
This fight is dumb!
We shouldn't have to do this!

00:19:52.718 --> 00:19:56.792
Doflamingo!

00:19:57.627 --> 00:19:59.531
Traffy!

00:20:04.274 --> 00:20:08.783
[LUFFY]
Fourth Gear!

00:20:11.622 --> 00:20:13.425
[LUFFY]
I know I can!

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:19.337
Sabo. Ace's fruit. You ate it?

00:20:24.147 --> 00:20:28.890
Seeing you makes it
hard to even breathe!

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:33.131
All right. King Kong...

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:36.237
...Gun!

00:20:49.364 --> 00:20:51.702
[KYROS] Seems like
they made it, after all.

00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:54.575
[REBECCA]
I was worried for a sec.

00:20:56.177 --> 00:20:58.482
I hope they'll come visit.

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:08.401
[giggles] Is it warm?

00:21:13.045 --> 00:21:17.587
Yes! It's much better this way.

00:21:23.633 --> 00:21:26.038
Aww. Are you crying, Dad?

00:21:26.138 --> 00:21:29.845
[KYROS] What? No! I never cry!
Don't be absurd!

00:21:35.623 --> 00:21:36.659
[SAI, ABDULLAH]
Wait!

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.602
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:44.374
[BARTOLOMEO crying]

00:21:44.474 --> 00:21:47.346
[CAVENDISH laughs]

00:21:48.449 --> 00:21:51.421
[laughing]

00:21:51.522 --> 00:21:53.726
[ZORO]
Hey, get over here!

00:21:54.728 --> 00:21:55.897
Ow!

00:21:55.997 --> 00:21:57.366
Ha!

00:21:57.466 --> 00:21:59.004
'Nother round?

00:21:59.104 --> 00:22:00.941
Yeah! Any time!

00:22:01.041 --> 00:22:02.343
[LAW]
Let go!

00:22:02.443 --> 00:22:05.415
Press nose for
advanced hair features.

00:22:08.957 --> 00:22:11.228
[DWARVES laughing]

00:22:11.328 --> 00:22:15.570
[CHIN JAO singing]

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.707
[ALL]
Cheers!

00:22:17.807 --> 00:22:20.814
I know you've got places to go,
but we'll see you again, right?

00:22:20.914 --> 00:22:23.419
[ROBIN]
Of course! We'll be back!

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.922
[WICKA, FLAPPER]
I can't wait!

00:22:25.022 --> 00:22:26.425
Ah! Great news!

00:22:26.526 --> 00:22:28.061
Well! Hello!

00:22:31.268 --> 00:22:33.706
[NARRATOR] After the hard-fought
battle in Dressrosa,

00:22:33.806 --> 00:22:37.112
a very unconventional vow
was made over cups of saké.

00:22:39.786 --> 00:22:42.156
[NARRATOR] By coincidence,
or by the hand of fate,

00:22:42.256 --> 00:22:44.629
when the paths of seven
mighty warriors crossed,

00:22:44.729 --> 00:22:47.567
they pledged their
loyalty to Luffy.

00:22:48.268 --> 00:22:51.274
Their own adventures will
bring them strength and renown.

00:22:51.374 --> 00:22:52.978
And one day in the future,

00:22:53.078 --> 00:22:55.182
they will play a part
in a great incident

00:22:55.282 --> 00:22:57.386
of historic proportions.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.092
[NARRATOR]
But for now at least,

00:23:00.192 --> 00:23:03.633
that's a story no one
could have anticipated.

00:23:14.555 --> 00:23:16.191
[NARRATOR]
The Straw Hats leave Dressrosa,

00:23:16.291 --> 00:23:17.761
confident in its future,

00:23:17.862 --> 00:23:20.600
but as Doflamingo is
carried off to Impel Down,

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.537
he makes a chilling statement.

00:23:22.637 --> 00:23:24.708
Now, the curtain rises
on a new era

00:23:24.808 --> 00:23:28.348
as the battle to rule
the stormy seas rages on.

00:23:28.448 --> 00:23:30.219
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:33.458
"The Numerous Rivals
Struggle Amongst Themselves!

00:23:33.559 --> 00:23:35.864
The Raging Monsters
of the New World!"

00:23:35.964 --> 00:23:38.803
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
