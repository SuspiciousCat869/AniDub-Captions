[LUFFY] Hey!
The other ones are gone too.

177
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,739
What just happened?
Who were those kids?

178
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,643
Hello? Pops?

179
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,548
[GROUP laughing]

180
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,517
Henzo! Hurry up
and get down here!

181
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,819
[HENZO]
But I'm scared!

182
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,321
[RAPA NUI] You can't be afraid
of something small like this!

183
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,923
We're the Pumpkin Pirates!

184
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:36,502
[HENZO yelling]

185
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,937
[splash]

186
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,348
[RAPA NUI]
You know, when I grow up,

187
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,550
I'm gonna be a real pirate!

188
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,619
But your father's
in the Marines,

189
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:54,787
isn't he, Rapa Nui?

190
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,756
Would he let you
become a pirate?

191
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,357
Never mind my dad.

192
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,459
I plan on having great
adventures in places

193
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,528
that nobody's ever seen before!

194
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,730
Places that nobody's
ever seen before?

195
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,798
Of course.

196
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,466
There's still a whole bunch
of things in the world

197
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,468
that nobody knows
anything about yet.

198
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,703
[RONGO laughs]

199
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,071
I'd like to see them, too.

200
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,105
That's great!

201
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,408
I want to become a pirate too!

202
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,709
Yeah.

203
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,878
But wouldn't we have to fight
with other pirates sometimes?

204
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,080
I'm way too weak
for something like that.

205
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,882
Well you're real good at
inventing different sorts

206
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,083
of things, right?

207
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,652
So then you can be in charge
of making all the equipment

208
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,921
we'll need for our adventures.

209
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,122
Okay!

210
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,391
I'll become a pirate
with you guys!

211
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,827
[AKIBI] That didn't take
much convincing, Henzo.

212
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:39,565
[GROUP laughing]

213
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,773
[HENZO] We were all so
happy back in those days.

214
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,608
Such good friends.

215
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,078
Always playing or talking
about something.

216
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,780
That was the best
time of my life.

217
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,750
Every day was
so perfect, so bright.

218
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,188
It was more valuable than
all the treasure in the world.

219
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,590
Then, one day,
something happened

220
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,025
that changed everything.

221
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,106
[GROUP gasps]

222
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,442
It's Henzo!

223
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,448
Henzo! You all right?

224
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,151
[HENZO coughs]

225
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,520
[chuckles]
The Kaboom Mark III!

226
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,021
It's perfect now!

227
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,794
[RAPA NUI] You idiot!
Don't scare us like that!

228
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,029
Jeez, you sure do
blow yourself up a lot!

229
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,035
Look, you guys!

230
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,737
The town is on fire!

231
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,039
The town is burning!
Look over there!

232
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,817
What the‐‐?

233
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,519
What's happening to Luluka?

234
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,688
Oh, no! My mom and dad!

235
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:11,824
Rongo!

236
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,068
[WETTON laughing]

237
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,236
Burn it all!

238
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,939
Leave nothing of value!

239
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,175
Kill everyone who dares
stand in our way!

240
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,043
Do you understand me,
Wetton Pirates?

241
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,179
Show them no mercy!

242
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,247
Get the women and children too!

243
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,750
[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

244
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,194
‐‐[WETTON chuckles]
‐‐[ISOKA] They're pirates!

245
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,095
Ah, now, what's this?

246
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,132
Some children who weren't smart
enough to run away from here.

247
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,935
Listen up, guys.

248
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,737
There should be some
ships down at the harbor.

249
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,706
We'll take one,
it doesn't matter which,

250
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:01,907
and get out of here!

251
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,709
But then what about Mom and Dad?

252
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,878
Idiot! Do you wanna get killed?

253
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,046
Now go!

You won't get away.

258
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:37,943
The ships!

259
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,812
They're all gone!
The pirates must have

260
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,146
sunk them already!

261
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,916
Over there!
We'll get on that one!

262
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,751
What? That one?
Are you sure?

263
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,119
[RAPA NUI] Well there
aren't any others, right?

264
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,254
Hurry!

265
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,296
What are you doing on my ship?!

266
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:00,799
Oh, no!

[WETTON] Do you really think
a little runt like you

279
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,056
can handle my axe?

280
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,259
You're too cocky for your
own good, you little brat.

281
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,827
I'm not a runt.

282
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,697
I am the captain of the

It's okay!

He's just one man!

we can defeat him!

are we settin' sail already?

The Rainbow Mist?

Hey! Hurry up and turn the helm!

up inside there,

Don't worry about me!

00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,514
I'll come after you all later!
I promise I will!

329
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,117
I'm a Pumpkin Pirate, after all!

330
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,819
I'll see you again!

331
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,122
Henzo...

332
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,397
[HENZO]
And after that day...

333
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,066
After that day,
Rapa Nui and the others

334
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,334
never returned.

335
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,571
I can't believe that
in a place like this

336
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,340
and after all this time
they're still pirates.

337
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,409
[USOPP]
Back it up there, Mr. Mustache.

338
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,011
I thought you said that all
happened 50 years ago,

339
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,481
but when we saw 'em just now,
they were still little kids.

340
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,349
The passage of time
in the Rainbow Mist

341
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,419
appears to be different than
ours is in the normal world.

342
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,421
One day in here might
be the same as a week,

343
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,256
or even a year, out there.

344
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,392
So, Rapa Nui and the others
don't seem to have aged.

345
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,094
[USOPP]
What, really?

346
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,163
[ROBIN] If that's true, we need
to find a way out of here

347
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,164
quickly.

348
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,900
If we don't, there'll be
no undoing the damage.

349
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:55,701
Why not?

350
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,536
[USOPP]
How dense are you, anyway?

351
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,505
The same thing that
happened to those little kids

352
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,007
and the professor
could happen to us, too.

353
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,609
While we're stuck
here doing nothing,

354
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,211
Nami, Sanji, and Chopper
will all get old and stuff

355
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,846
in the real world!

356
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,248
Really?!

357
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,350
All right, Pops.
Let's get out of here. Fast!

358
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,552
[USOPP] Where have you been?
We don't know how to get out

359
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,288
‐‐of this place!
‐‐[LUFFY] We don't? Seriously?

360
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,223
So, there's no way back?

361
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,358
Maybe.

362
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,360
There must be an escape.

363
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,096
There has to be some
way out of Ape's Concert.

364
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,165
[LUFFY]
That many? Nuh‐uh.

365
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,175
Jeez. Stop. Really.

366
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,343
He is persistent,
that's for sure.

367
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,713
Oh, stop your whining,
and let's finish this!

368
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,117
[LAKE yelps]

369
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,723
[GROUP]
Huh?

370
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:52,691
[SOLDIER A]
Lake, sir!

371
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,627
[SOLDIER B]
Are you gonna be all right, sir?

372
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,695
[LAKE grunts]

373
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,235
[LAKE] Are you the ones
who threw that at me?!

374
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,203
[SANJI]
It wasn't us.

375
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,370
[NAMI]
Shouldn't he know that?

376
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,438
He was watching us.

377
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,140
[CHOPPER] With that suit on,
we're not trying to

378
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,107
make him mad.

379
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,743
[LAKE] Tell me, now!
Was it you who did this?

380
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,612
And what if we say it was?

381
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,284
[GROUP]
You're just picking it up?!

382
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,385
All right, then.

383
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,421
I've collected
your harbor taxes.

384
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,488
Now that you all have paid,

385
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,159
I formally welcome you
here to the town of Luluka.

386
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,227
[GROUP]
Huh?

387
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,397
[SANJI] Ape's Concert?
Is that what you said?

388
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,398
[LAKE]
Yeah.

389
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,400
Ape's Concert, that's right.

390
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,769
Some of our soldiers reported
that they saw your ship

391
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,605
entering the Rainbow Mist.

392
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,406
There's no doubt about it.

393
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,108
According to what
the mayor says,

394
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,677
there's all sorts of
treasure piled up in there.

395
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,678
Treasure?!

396
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,647
[LAKE] People also say
that Ape's Concert is

397
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,349
a ship graveyard.

398
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,150
All the shipwrecks
in there apparently

399
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,287
have tons of untouched
cargo just laying around.

400
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,489
Jewels, coins, and stuff.

401
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:58,757
The mayor wants the treasure,

402
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,260
so he's got a scientist
named Henzo researching

403
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,528
a way to get into Ape's Concert.

404
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,531
And it was the old scientist
guy who made the suit for me.

405
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,202
Uh‐huh. It's a pretty slick
weapon, don't you think? Ha.

406
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,804
Sanji? Is it just me,
or does he talk a lot?

407
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,440
He does. It's almost like he's
still trying to punish us

408
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,608
for not paying.

409
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,377
We can't just stand still here!

410
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,380
We're going into that mist too,
so let's get a move on.

411
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,682
Yes, sir, Nami!

412
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,184
[CHOPPER] But once we go inside,
there's no coming back out!

413
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,886
[NAMI] This is no time
to be scared, Chopper!

414
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,488
The treasure is waiting for us!

415
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,290
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

416
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,158
[WETTON]
I don't think so.

417
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:37,796
No one goes into Ape's Concert
without my permission.

418
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,630
Grandpa!

419
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:39,798
[WETTON]
You idiot!

420
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,300
[LAKE grunts]

421
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,701
Did he say "grandpa"?

422
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:46,138
[WETTON] How many times have
I had to tell you, Lake?

423
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,476
You're not to address
me as "grandpa."

424
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,211
Do you understand that?

425
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,516
I'm to be called Mayor Wetton.

professor and these little kids

440
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:20,732
were the same age?

441
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:21,933
Hey, Luffy, what are you doing?

442
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,436
[LUFFY] If we get the ship
going, we can get out of here.

443
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,971
[USOPP] Should we be
doing that without Nami?

444
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,839
[ZORO] I'm sure she's mad
about being left behind.

[LUFFY] She might be a wrinkled
old woman by now, huh?

like that, Luffy!
