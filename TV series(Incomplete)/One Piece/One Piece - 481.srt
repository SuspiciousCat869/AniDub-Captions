1
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,357
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,093
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,661
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,664
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,199
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,002
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,670
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,606
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,476
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,111
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,646
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:02,650
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,386
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,789
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,959
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:16,630
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,404
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest the of his crew,

18
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:27,641
Luffy has arrived at Marineford
to rescue his brother, Ace.

19
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,077
Aided by new friends
and old enemies alike,

20
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,745
Luffy battles against the Navy

21
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,781
as he pushes
towards the scaffold.

22
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:36,417
Thanks to a final charge
from Whitebeard's associates

23
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,285
and a bridge built by Inazuma,

24
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,155
success is within
Luffy's grasp at long last.

25
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,694
[LUFFY groans]

26
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,197
[LUFFY panting]

27
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,735
Finally, I'm here.

28
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,904
I told you I'd do it!

29
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,505
Luffy!

30
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:02,209
Hmph. You really are crazy.

31
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,410
[MARINE EE]
Fire!

32
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,946
Blow them to bits
before they hit the ground!

33
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,890
[MARINE FF]
What is that?

34
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,526
It looks like
a tunnel of flames!

35
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,594
[ACE]
Ever since you were little,

36
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,997
you've never listened
to a word I said,

37
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,498
have you?

38
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:27,501
[LUFFY grunts]

39
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:30,203
Then you run off
and do something crazy.

40
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,144
Like old times, huh, Luffy?

41
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,722
Let's go!

42
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:59,566
[LUFFY] "Ace Rescued!
Whitebeard's Final Order!"

43
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:10,110
[PIRATES cheering]

44
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,493
[MARINE A]
That's... Fire Fist Ace!

45
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,431
[PIRATE A]
He's free!

46
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:33,701
Yee-haw! Ya did it,
Straw Hat! Yeah!

47
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,370
Hah, hah! You can suck it, Navy!

48
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,907
He hasn't slowed down once,
after all he's been through!

49
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,743
You can't... stop this guy!

50
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,145
Your papa would be so proud!

51
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,115
[crying]

52
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,218
[HANCOCK giggles]
I knew you could do it!

53
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,087
But this is only
the beginning of your

54
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,258
long, happy ending with
me at your side, of course.

55
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,494
Because as soon as you escape
this wretched battlefield...

56
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,196
...we'll be... married!

57
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,832
[HELMEPPO gasping]

58
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,133
[HELMEPPO]
See that?

59
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,401
He really did it!

60
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,970
That crazy little
bastard saved Ace!

61
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,375
Of course he did.
After all, he's Luffy.

62
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:18,178
Keep your cool!
This isn't over yet!

63
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,214
Open fire as soon as they land!

64
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,982
[MARINES]
Sir!

65
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,852
Let's split up for now!

66
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,420
Don't let your guard down yet!

67
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,521
Okay!

68
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,323
--[LUFFY grunts]
--[MR. 3] Wait, no!

69
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,596
Flame Commandment!

70
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,231
[MARINES gasp]

71
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,632
Fire Pillar!

72
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:42,269
[MARINES scream]

73
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:49,242
[MARINES screaming]

74
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,860
[MR. 3 grunts]

75
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,367
They're strong! Be careful, men!

76
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,608
Can you still fight, Luffy?

77
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,444
'Course I can!

78
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:26,379
Luffy! Ace!

79
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,516
Remember, Ace is a Logia type,

80
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,418
so he's gonna be
really tough to hit.

81
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,588
Never thought I'd need my
little brother to save me.

82
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,890
Guess I'll swallow
my pride this time.

83
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,360
I owe you one, Luffy.

84
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,528
[LUFFY chuckles]

85
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,130
Thanks, but I sure
couldn't've done it

86
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,332
if Whitebeard hadn't shown up.

87
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,802
You think we'll
let you get away?

88
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,506
[MARINE E] Consider this your
execution ground, pirates!

[LUFFY grunts]

91
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,552
Now charge!

92
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,887
I'll cut him to pieces!

93
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,188
[LUFFY]
Hm.

94
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,592
[MARINES grunting]

95
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,894
[ACE] That's my little brother
you're trying to murder.

96
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,862
I'll have to ask you to stop.

97
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,766

98
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,801

Now, second Gear!

Huh?

[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

105
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:41,388

Huh?

106
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,456
[LUFFY]
...Jet Stamp!

[ACE]
Hm?

You're dead!

[MARINES gasping]

114
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,744
This is fun and all,

115
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:07,414
but the sooner we leave this
dump the better, right? Hmph!

116
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,482
Uh-huh!

117
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:14,054
Hah, hah, hah. They're
a fine team, I dare say.

118
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,056
We're pulling out, clear a path!

119

[PIRATES cheering]

120
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,997
We can't let them get away!

Heh. Firefly!

130
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,798
I gotta admit, you've
gotten pretty tough, Luffy.

00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,035
[LUFFY]
Hmph.

132
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,744
One of these days,
I'll be stronger than you!

--[ACE grunts]
--[LUFFY gasps]

134
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,721
All right, then I'll handle
things in the meantime.

135
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:57,591
"One of these days"?
Sorry, kid.

136
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,761
You're not gonna survive
to see tomorrow, I'm afraid.

137
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,830
Go finish 'em off, Admiral!

138
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,531
What a pain.

139
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,902
All right, Ice Block.

140
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:10,403
Stand back, Luffy.

141
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,984
And now, Pheasant Beak!

142
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,852
Flame Mirror!

00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,267
He vaporized Aokiji's ice.

146
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,569
Damn, I didn't know
you could do that.

[VISTA laughs]

148
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,274
Well, I can't blame Ace
for showing off a bit.

149
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,376
It's been a long time coming.

Whoa!

that's so cool!

Now's not the time
to be impressed!

153
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,950
Unless you're impressed
with me, that is!

154
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,919
In other words,
fix that transponder snail,

155
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,988
so I can show off again!

156
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,923

Enjoy your time
in the limelight,

160
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:45,633
'cause everything's about
to come crashing down.

161
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,568
And the biggest crash
is gonna be Whitebeard

162
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,870
after I take his head
in all this chaos.

163
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:53,007
He's gotta be on
his last leg anyway.

the situation gets,

greets it with a smile!

I hope I could honor your
memory in my own humble way.

Any who, that's enough heroism
for a lifetime. I'm leaving!

is this traitor from?

Oh!

175
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:24,838
[MARINE BB] Hold on! He's a
prisoner impersonating a guard!

176
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,641
No! I was too slow!

00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:33,180
This is the worst
blunder of my life.

180
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,815
We have to rectify this.

181
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,984
[laughing]

182
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:37,718
Huh?

183
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,153
Just let 'em go.

184
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:42,256
It makes things more
interesting, I say!

185
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,592
Cut the crap!

186
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,994
Those guys went toe-to-toe
with an Admiral!

187
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,229
What the hell are
we supposed to do?

188
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,898
[AKAINU]
Pull yourselves together!

189
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,766
[MARINES gasp]

190
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,834
[MARINES]
Admiral Sakazuki!

191
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,506
They won't make it out of
here alive, don't you worry.

192
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:06,213
Don't give up, men!
We've got this!

193
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,650
[MARINES gasp]

194
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:14,888
Great, what the hell is it now?

195
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:20,027
[MARINES shouting]

196
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,196
[MARINE CC] The enemy
ship is coming through!

197
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,198
Uh, on land somehow!

198
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,232
[MARINE DD]
Don't get close!

199
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,134
It's running on the
ground with it's paddles!

200
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:27,968
[PIRATES gasp]

201
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,737
Wait, who's on board?
I can't see!

202
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,345
It's Squard!

203
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:40,681
And it looks like he's got
his crew with him, too!

204
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,082
[WHITEBEARD grunts]

205
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:46,820
Make a break for it,
Pops! We'll guard you!

206
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,222
We'll show those bastards

207
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,624
the pride of the
Spider Whorl Pirates!

208
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,426
[PIRATES shout]

209
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,664
[WHITEBEARD]
Ah, damn it.

210
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:58,098
What're you thinking?

211
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:19,886
[PIRATES]
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

212
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,093
Don't be an idiot,
Squard. You'll die!

213
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,528
Yeah! You got a death
wish or something?

214
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,732
[SQUARD sighs]

215
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,467
[SQUARD]
Yes, of course.

216
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:39,573
After what I did to Pops,
this is the least I can do.

217
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,749
[SQUARD] I can't hope to atone
for my crime, but if I don't die

218
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:52,185
fighting here, I know
I'll never rest in peace!

219
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,091
I'm sorry for
bringing you with me.

220
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,059
This should be my fight.

221
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,862
What? Are you kidding me?
We wanted to follow you!

222
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:04,131
Yeah, you're our captain
till the bitter end!

223
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,934
If we all die here,
then that's our choice!

224
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,636
[PIRATE AA]
Let's not get sentimental here.

225
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,971
Lead the charge, Captain!

226
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,405
[SQUARD]
Thank you.

227
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:17,544
[SQUARD] Everyone else,
grab Ace, and make a run for it!

228
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,981
St. Elmo's Fire!

229
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,782
[MARINES yell]

230
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:25,519
[gasps]

231
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,254
[ACE]
Squard?

232
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,429
Those fools...

233
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,933
[MARCO grunts]
Squard, no!

234
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:41,869
You think anyone's gonna be
happy with a plan like this?

235
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:45,438
Hey! Hurry up and get
these cuffs off me!

236
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:51,111
You ready? We'll
fight to the last man!

237
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:55,816
[PIRATES]
Yeah!

238
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:59,719
All right, charge!

239
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:12,666
For Pops...

240
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:17,404
[yells]

241
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:23,010
[SQUARD, PIRATES grunting]

242
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:26,479
What the hell?
Did we run into something?

243
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,416
Huh?

244
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:46,166
[panting]

245
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,868
But why, Pops?

246
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:51,105
He... stopped it with one hand.

247
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:54,575
I thought he was
supposed to be dying!

248
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:55,376
[ACE, LUFFY gasping]

249
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,610
[MARCO grunts]

250
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:03,283
[panting]

251
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,491
[WHITEBEARD] You believe
you've done me a favor,

252
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:13,060
you poor, selfish child?

253
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,095
Don't you know how cruel it is

254
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:18,499
to force a father
to bury his own sons?

255
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:19,900
[gasps]

256
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,644
And show some humility!

257
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,379
You think I'm on my last legs

258
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,048
'cause of one measly poke?

259
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:37,184
It was settled long
before I came here!

260
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:41,154
Everyone has to grow
old and die someday.

261
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,426
[ALL gasping]

262
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:49,263
[SQUARD gasping]

263
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,298
[WHITEBEARD]
Our business is done.

264
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,667
Pull out now and I'll
stay here to make sure

265
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,937
I don't lose any more of
my boys to these bastards.

266
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,072
You're staying?

267
00:18:58,105 --> 00:18:59,940
Whaddaya mean?

268
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:06,380
[WHITEBEARD]
Listen up, Whitebeard Pirates,

269
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,348
and listen well.

270
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:14,922
[WHITEBEARD] These are my
final orders as your captain,

271
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:17,024
so you'd better follow them!

272
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:20,127
You're kidding, right? That's
the last thing we wanna hear!

273
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,695
We're going back together!

274
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,731
[PIRATE L] Yeah! We can't
go on without you!

275
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:27,268
We didn't save Ace
to let our captain die!

276
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,402
[MARINES yelling]

277
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:30,638
[ACE]
Cross Fire!

278
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,740
[ACE grunts]
Let's go!

279
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:36,043
[WHITEBEARD] Even family
must part ways now and then!

280
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:37,811
You must, survive.

281
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:43,583
Return to the New World.
Continue your legacy without me!

282
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:55,262
No, you can't die!
We can find another way!

283
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,669
[WHITEBEARD] Make no mistake.
I'm a relic of a bygone era.

284
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:08,208
Long have I sailed, but no ship
can carry me into the new age.

285
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:20,086
[WHITEBEARD]
Now go and forge your own path!

286
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:28,395
[MARINES yelling]

287
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,198
Whitebeard!

288
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:41,709
There's no way
we can leave you here!

289
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,245
Look, I know how you feel,
but it's an order!

290
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:45,512
Old Guy, no!

291
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,414
What are you--?

292
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:04,698
[WHITEBEARD]
Don't look back boys.

293
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:07,234
A new age is coming.

294
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:52,613
[seagulls squawking]

295
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:57,250
[WHITEBEARD] Everything
started on those warm waters.

296
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:03,490
[PIRATE N laughing]
Aw man, what a haul!

297
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:06,894
Hey! You don't even care
about treasure, you weirdo?

298
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:09,930
Come check it out! There's
plenty to go around, buddy!

299
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:12,700
Tch! Forget it,
he's always like this.

300
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:14,702
[PIRATE C]
Huh? What does that mean?

301
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:17,438
We wouldn't even have
these treasures without him!

302
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:19,373
Whatever, it's nothin'
to complain about.

303
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,508
If he doesn't care,
then neither should we.

304
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,111
But it's weird!
Pirates live for the booty!

305
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:26,447
Why else would you
be in the game?

306
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,050
[PIRATE C] Well, what are
you looking for then?

307
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,719
Hey! You listening, Newgate?

308
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:53,406
[WHITEBEARD] It's been a long
journey, but a good one.

309
00:22:58,345 --> 00:23:01,682
Let's finally
put an end to this!

310
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,684
You Navy bastards!

311
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:11,825
The Whitebeard Pirates
reluctantly follow

312
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,094
the captain's final
order to retreat.

313
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:16,964
However, Akainu refuses
to let his enemies escape,

314
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:19,733
and provokes Ace by
insulting his adoptive father.

315
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,869
Ace fights to defend
the honor of his crew,

316
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,471
but risks losing
his life in the process.

317
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,106
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

318
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:28,242
"The Power That Can
Burn Even Fire

319
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:30,578
Akainu's Ruthless Pursuit!"

320
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,846
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
