1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,158
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,827
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,298
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:50,336
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,806
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,177
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,445
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:03,049
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,019
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:09,289
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,292
You've made a
mockery of human life!

48
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,127
Fasfasfasfas!

49
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,962
What a narrow-minded
thing to say!

50
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,197
I gave them a new life,

51
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,500
and yet you think they should
just be rotting in the ground?

52
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,303
Observe!

53
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,506
[HOGBACK]
Ha!

54
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:36,382
[HOGBACK] Now, while you're
down there, lick the floor.

55
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,551
[CINDRY]
Yes, Master Hogback.

56
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,490
[CHOPPER]
A human being

57
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,526
whose heart and
body have been separated

58
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,861
is no human at all!

59
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,164
You've took a corpse that
had no choice in the matter

60
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,166
and turned it into
nothing more than a monster!

61
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,934
Every time you make
one of these creatures,

62
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,170
somewhere there's
a human you've devastated!

63
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,372
And what would a
stupid reindeer pirate-doctor

64
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,007
with such limited medical skill

65
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,009
possibly know about life?

66
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,011
Cindry! Rise!

67
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,546
Rise and kill them all!

68
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,215
One! Two! Three!

69
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,361
Listen, Cindry,

70
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,229
you don't have to
take orders from that maniac.

71
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,931
You--

72
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,199
I'll kill you.

73
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:35,041
Just because it moves
doesn't make it alive.

74
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,210
To be alive,
you gotta be free!

75
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,378
You're treating
her like she's nothing.

76
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:42,215
Anything that exists like
that can't be a human being!

77
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,651
Dogguin! Jigoro!

78
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,386
Help her! Quickly!

79
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,921
Save Cindry!
Kill the others!

80
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,226
[JIGORO]
Three Sword Style.

81
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,228
One hundred and eight...

82
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,299
...Caliber Phoenix!

83
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,971
Careful with that
attack, you almost killed me!

84
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,440
[DOGGUIN] He said, "Kill the
others" -- I'll start with you!

85
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:22,088
And once I do, I'll say,

86
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:22,822
"Jump off this tower

87
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,590
and put an
end to yourselves!"

88
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:42,141
My body, it won't move.

89
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,177
What? Cindry!

90
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,479
Kushishishi!

91
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,513
He's back!

92
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,390
Kushishishi!

93
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,593
[LUFFY]
What's going on?

94
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,328
Now, the time
has arrived at last,

95
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,563
my beautiful Oars!

96
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:42,602
Kushishishi!
Kushishishi!

97
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,077
[LUFFY]
"Oars Roars!

98
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,112
Come out, Straw Hat Crew"!

99
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,195
Hey! Cindry, what's
the matter with you?

100
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,763
Cindry, answer me!

101
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,532
What's going on here?

102
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,067
This isn't funny, Cindry!
Please!

103
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,103
Say something already!

104
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:24,043
[CINDRY]
My body, it won't move.

105
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:29,749
And these tears won't stop.

106
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,717
Your body won't move?

107
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,653
Do you expect
me to believe that?

108
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,055
And stop the
crocodile tears!

109
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,124
If you didn't have a
shadow put in your body,

110
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,091
you would be dead!

111
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,228
And who do you have
to thank for that, huh?

112
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,164
A zombie's only purpose
is to serve its master!

113
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,401
I made you, and I can
unmake you just as easily!

114
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,402
It's strange.

115
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,604
It seems as if the
original owner of the body

116
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,839
is fighting back.

117
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,608
Yeah, but that person
died over ten years ago.

118
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,743
Does that mean
a body without a soul

119
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,480
can still have
a will of its own?

120
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,315
Who can really say?

121
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,151
Even if we read every book
in every library in the world,

122
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,119
we wouldn't know.

123
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,827
I will kill both of them.

124
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:15,628
There we go!

125
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,763
That's the
Cindry I know and love!

126
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:18,865
Good to have you back!

127
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,800
Try to buy
me some time, okay?

128
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,768
I'm getting
the hell out of here!

129
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,470
It's a shame.

130
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,473
For a moment, I actually
thought a miracle had happened.

131
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,509
It's time for Doce Fleur!

132
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,349
[CHOPPER]
You get back here!

133
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,319
Are you kidding,
do you think I'm crazy?

134
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,291
Uh-oh. It sounds like
Oars has finally returned!

135
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,663
You stupid pirate deer!

136
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,733
Why are you siding with
a corpse instead of a genius?

137
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,567
Let me go!

138
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,335
You're not even
human to begin with,

139
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,905
so what the hell do
you even care, you monster?

140
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,506
The captain of our crew

141
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,575
is just fine
with monsters like me

142
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,311
and moss-heads
and perverts and cyborgs, too!

143
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,381
And all of us
get along just fine!

144
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,649
And unlike you, our captain

145
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,517
doesn't need to turn
people into zombie slaves

146
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,352
to get them to listen to him!

147
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,820
I don't care! Let me go!

148
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,489
Now!

149
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,490
Certainly.

150
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,191
Leave it to me.

151
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,826
Pierna Fleurs!

152
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,896
Why do I suddenly
feel as if I'm walking on air?

153
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,404
[HOGBACK]
Help me!

154
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,706
[HOGBACK]
T-T-Time out, Doctor Chopper,

155
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,374
let's be reasonable!

156
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,843
Try to consider the
consequences here for a moment!

157
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,512
If you splattered
my genius brains

158
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,680
all over the
floor right now,

159
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,449
you'd be doing a disservice
to the medical community!

160
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,717
I don't care!

161
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,252
That "genius brain" of yours

162
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,853
is even more
rotten than your zombies!

163
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,221
I thought you
were a man of reason,

164
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:49,922
Doctor Chopper!

165
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,357
Can't we
work something out?

166
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,692
Eat this!

167
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:56,846
Now, Robin--
Chopper Suplex!

168
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,891
This guy's even
bigger than a giant!

169
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:11,027
Is that really my zombie?

170
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,296
[MORIA]
Kushishishi!

171
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,032
You've kept me waiting,
haven't you, Oars?

172
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,700
It seems your
body and shadow

173
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:20,202
have finally fused properly.

174
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:22,705
I take it you'll
be obedient from now on?

175
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:23,939
Let's find out.

176
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:26,942
Answer me,
who is your master?

177
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,779
Gecko Moria.

178
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:31,580
You are my master.

179
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:33,282
No way!

180
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:34,917
Kushishishi!

181
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,986
Hey, what the hell
do you think you're saying?

182
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,754
I thought you were
'sposed to be my shadow!

183
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:39,989
You don't have to
listen to this guy--

184
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,090
He sucks!

185
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:43,726
Huh?

186
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,595
Who are you, and what's
with that dumb hat?

187
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:48,064
Kushishishi!

188
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,231
Now that
everything is in order,

189
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:51,267
let me give you
your first mission!

190
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,768
Take a look at your arm.

191
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:55,071
I've placed some
wanted posters there.

192
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:57,006
[MORIA]
These dastardly fellows

193
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,576
are causing a ruckus
on your poor master's island.

194
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:01,744
They're called

195
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,746
the "Straw Hat Pirates."

196
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,614
[MORIA] Find them,
crush every last one of them,

197
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:07,650
and then put them
back on their ship!

198
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:08,951
If you kill
one or two of them,

199
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:10,086
it's no problem.

200
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,788
Besides, their bounties
are over a hundred million,

201
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:15,024
so they won't fall
apart after a few punches,

202
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,258
even from you.

203
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:17,860
So don't hold back!

204
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,862
I want to see
every ounce of your power!

205
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,830
[MORIA]
Understand?

206
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:21,831
'Kay.

207
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:23,866
You got it, Master.

208
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:32,308
Oh. Found one.
It's Straw Hat.

209
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:36,178
So long. Straw Hat!

210
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:37,113
What?

211
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,714
You're running away?

212
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,216
Get back here!

213
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,319
[OARS]
Gum-Gum...

214
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,988
Hey! That's my move!

215
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:47,323
You jerk!

216
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:49,725
[OARS]
...Bell!

217
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:03,038
Huh?

218
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:04,874
Uh-oh!

219
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:06,675
[HOGBACK]
What now?

220
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,712
Tha-That's Luffy's Zombie!

221
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:11,680
Oars! Help!

222
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:18,888
The floor's
going to collapse.

223
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,423
Chopper!
Over here, quickly!

224
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,657
Got it!

225
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,698
[CHOPPER]
Wow, that was a close one.

226
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:51,720
That giant is Luffy?

227
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:59,195
Hogback and Cindry
fell to the floor below

228
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,796
and it doesn't look
like they're moving.

229
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,434
[HOGBACK]
Too heavy. Damn it.

230
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:10,473
Cindry, hurry up!

231
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,942
Get over here
and move this rock!

232
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,921
This isn't funny, Cindry!

233
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:28,224
I really need
your help right now!

234
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,160
Oars is going to crush me
like a giant cockroach!

235
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:34,330
I can't die!

236
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,732
I'm far too smart to die!

237
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:39,068
I have so much left to give!

238
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,836
I'm your master, damn it!

239
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,440
Why are you just
standing there? Hurry!

240
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:56,785
I can't move.

241
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:58,320
My body won't move.

242
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,879
I can't move.

243
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,147
My body won't move.

244
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,382
Say what?

245
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:51,473
Enough already!

246
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:53,242
I don't want
to hear anymore!

247
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,478
The only will a zombie has
is the will to follow orders!

248
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:01,483
So hurry up and save me!

249
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,886
You're nothing but
a corpse with a pretty face!

250
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,421
Don't pretend you're human!

251
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:33,549
Hey!

252
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:36,051
I'm dying here, Cindry!

253
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:38,387
Oars is gonna stomp me!

254
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,123
[HOGBACK screaming]

255
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,524
Oars, look down here!

256
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:44,360
Watch where
you're stepping, damn it!

257
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,362
[HOGBACK]
It's me, you oaf!

258
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:48,530
You'd still be dead
in a block of ice right now

259
00:15:48,564 --> 00:15:50,232
if it wasn't for my genius!

260
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,134
[HOGBACK screaming]

261
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,242
[USOPP] Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

262
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:01,377
That last tremor was
one thing,

263
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,312
but this feels like the
whole mansion's coming down!

264
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:17,259
It's the Luffy Zombie!

265
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,484
[USOPP screaming]

266
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:39,690
Uh-oh.

267
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,091
That doesn't sound good.

268
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,359
What's going on here?

269
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:46,430
Crap! What now?

270
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,070
Is that thing
Luffy's Zombie?

271
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,306
[SANJI]
Damn it.

272
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:57,541
[SANJI]
Nami, hey,

273
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,476
now would be
a good time to wake up.

274
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:01,045
There's nothing I can do.

275
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,047
Guess I'm just
gonna have to run for it.

276
00:17:06,617 --> 00:17:08,318
Hey, Nami?

277
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:12,056
Nami?

278
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:15,726
She just disappeared.

279
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,264
[ABSALOM growls]

280
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:21,231
It's you again.

281
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:26,236
[ABSALOM] Looks like
the tables have turned.

282
00:17:28,272 --> 00:17:29,239
You bastard.

283
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:30,607
So you're still alive, huh?

284
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:33,577
If you wanna finish this,
stop hiding and bring it on!

285
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:39,750
[ABSALOM laughing]

286
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:41,985
[ABSALOM]
Well, well.

287
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:46,590
That troublemaking giant
is finally under our control.

288
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,792
[ABSALOM] In other
words, you're screwed!

289
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:51,662
I think I'll be taking
my bride for good this time!

290
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,863
[SANJI]
Like hell you will!

291
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,598
You give Nami back!

292
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:56,600
Where the hell
are you hiding her?

293
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,338
[ABSALOM]
Aw, are you lonely?

294
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,274
Then why don't you
play with Oars, here?

295
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:19,156
Hey, that felt
like an earthquake--

296
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:20,290
What just happened?

297
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,725
I haven't a clue.

298
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:25,295
But whatever it was,
it made my hairs stand on end.

299
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:26,897
[BROOK] Ah, but I'm a
skeleton, so I don't have--

300
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:28,732
Oh no, wait a minute.

301
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:31,835
That's right,
I do have hair.

302
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:33,804
You fight so hard
to protect your afro,

303
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:35,305
then you forget you have it?

304
00:18:35,305 --> 00:18:37,141
[FRANKY] Maybe I'll give
you a pompadour like mine.

305
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:38,509
Would that help you remember?

306
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:39,376
[BROOK]
No, no thank you.

307
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,744
[FRANKY]
Get over here!

308
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:54,324
What is that?

309
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:55,826
No idea,
but whatever it is,

310
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:57,494
it's giving me goosebumps.

311
00:18:57,528 --> 00:18:58,829
Or, it would, but...

312
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,183
Oh, man.

313
00:19:19,216 --> 00:19:21,185
It's some
kinda giant monster!

314
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:24,254
Have mercy!

315
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,394
That's...

316
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:31,762
That's a zombie.

317
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:34,198
[FRANKY]
Ah crap.

318
00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:36,900
[FRANKY] That must
be Luffy's zombie.

319
00:19:37,868 --> 00:19:39,236
Hey, look down there!

320
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:40,537
Someone else came
out of the building,

321
00:19:40,571 --> 00:19:42,573
and it looks
like Chef Curly Brows!

322
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,550
[coughing]

323
00:19:58,288 --> 00:19:59,289
Damn it!

324
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,461
I failed her.

325
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,796
What the
hell is he doing?

326
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,631
He's gonna get stomped on!

327
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:10,567
[LUFFY]
Moria!

328
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:15,239
--Kushishishi!
--Get back here!

329
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:17,908
Are you running from
your shadow or chasing me?

330
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:19,977
Giant monster me
is gonna be a problem,

331
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,312
but if I wanna get
everyone's shadows back

332
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,015
then I guess I'm gonna have
to beat you anyway, aren't I?

333
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:26,583
So get back here!

334
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:39,263
Too bad!

335
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:40,964
But it looks
like the last laugh

336
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:42,833
belongs to me!

337
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,968
[ABSALOM]
She's still out cold.

338
00:20:45,002 --> 00:20:48,005
I'll take her
someplace safe.

339
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,640
Don't you worry!

340
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:52,843
It may be in private,
but we'll have our wedding yet.

341
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,778
My sleeping beauty.

342
00:20:57,447 --> 00:20:58,982
[ZOMBIE PANDA]
Is Mistress Perona all right?

343
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:00,317
[ZOMBIE KOALA]
I think so.

344
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,285
She passed out,

345
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:02,619
but it doesn't
look like she was injured.

346
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:03,654
[ZOMBIE PANDA]
Where's Captain Kumacy?

347
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:05,355
Did that
long-nose guy purify him?

348
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,291
[ZOMBIE KOALA]
How did this happen?

349
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:11,962
[ZOMBIE KOALA]
Let's get out of here.

350
00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:13,864
This mansion's
as good as done-for.

351
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,365
We can let
the special zombie

352
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,467
take care of
the Straw Hats for us.

353
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:20,470
This is rotten, man!

354
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,306
We gotta get outta
here, like right now!

355
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,809
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 364A] The special
zombie's going on a rampage!

356
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:27,644
[ZOMBIE 343A]
I'm going back to my grave!

357
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:28,412
Look!

358
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:30,013
He's taller
than the mansion!

359
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:32,015
[MOC DONALD] He's just
stomping over everything!

360
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:33,483
We could be next!

361
00:21:40,824 --> 00:21:42,659
That is not good!

362
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:43,660
[CHOPPER]
Usopp!

363
00:21:44,661 --> 00:21:46,430
Hey, Robin! Chopper!

364
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:47,397
We're in trouble here!

365
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,598
Big trouble!

366
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:50,934
The-- The Luffy
Zombie has our faces.

367
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:53,070
No wait,
I mean, on his arm!

368
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,006
He has our wanted posters!

369
00:22:03,513 --> 00:22:05,515
What do we do now?

370
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:12,456
Aw man, this is no joke!

371
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:22,866
He's gonna hunt us down!

372
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:27,938
Show yourselves!

373
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,873
Come out, Straw Hats.

374
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:34,378
You can't hide from me!

375
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:40,050
Damn it, Luffy.

376
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,886
Your zombie's gonna
be a real pain in the ass.

377
00:22:43,553 --> 00:22:44,654
C'mon, Captain,

378
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:47,124
you're not gonna tear
apart your own crew, are you?

379
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:50,827
It seems he's
been given the order.

380
00:22:50,894 --> 00:22:53,430
[CHOPPER] I just hope
the real Luffy is all right.

381
00:22:53,463 --> 00:22:56,099
Don't eat me, I'm all bones!

382
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:58,902
Are we supposed to
fight that damn thing? No way.

383
00:23:11,248 --> 00:23:12,983
[ZORO]
Looks like fun.

384
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:20,524
[CHOPPER]
Sanji!

385
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,426
[FRANKY] That thing
may look like a big lug,

386
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:23,693
but it's fast on its feet!

387
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,762
You fight it head-on
and you're done for!

388
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:26,930
[CHOPPER]
Are you crazy, Sanji?

389
00:23:26,963 --> 00:23:27,864
What are you thinking?

390
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:28,999
[FRANKY]
This is it.

391
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,267
It ain't gonna be pretty,

392
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:32,836
but we're gonna have to show
that monster what we're made of!

393
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:33,870
[FRANKY]
You ready?

394
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:35,772
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece.

395
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:36,773
Luffy is the Enemy!

396
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:39,976
The Ultimate
"Zombie vs the Straw Hat Crew!"

397
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,479
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
