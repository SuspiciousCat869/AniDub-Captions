WEBVTT

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.105
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.810
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.213
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.448
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.418
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.687
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.690
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:26.526
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:35.054
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:37.957
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:42.262
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:45.331
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:46.900
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:50.703
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:54.607
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.878
[NARRATOR]
Two years have passed

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:01.414
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:03.816
Luffy and his crew
underwent special training

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.220
before reuniting to continue
on to the New World.

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:10.523
They are now separated once
again on Fishman Island,

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:13.426
thousands of feet
below sea level.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.228
[PIRATES scream]

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.265
[BOTH gasp]

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.001
Let's go! Break through!

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.874
We're off to the Sea Forest!

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.180
[LUFFY]
"The Ryugu Palace in Shock!

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.482
The Kidnapping of Shirahoshi!"

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.057
[DEN]
Thank you for making the trip!

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.626
I don't get many
visitors from above!

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:47.694
No problem!

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.596
When Tom told me his
kid brother back home

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.332
was also a shipwright,
I knew I had to visit.

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:55.401
[DEN laughs] Still.
Traveling to Fishman Island's

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:57.604
a pretty difficult task.

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:58.838
It's not bad.

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.107
Training with Tom since
I was young paid off!

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.410
My crewmates and I made it
here on a ship that I built!

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:05.845
Is that so?

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:09.849
Well, you were my brother's
pupil, it must be a fine vessel.

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:11.117
Yeah!

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.253
The <i>Thousand Sunny</i> 'll take
us anywhere we wanna go!

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:16.089
It's my life's work,
my masterpiece!

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:19.158
[DEN] I'd love to see
it before ya leave.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.360
Yeah, about that.

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:21.861
After we got to Fishman Island,

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:24.464
the <i>Sunny</i> was swept
away by the tide.

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.599
That's one of the reasons
I came to see you.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.901
You know the area
much better than I do.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.571
Do ya have any idea where
the ship might have turned up?

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.973
[DEN]
Trust me, you'll find it.

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:37.010
But where do I even start?

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:38.611
[DEN] It's a funny thing,
but when ships sink

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:41.214
around these parts, the tide
almost always carries them

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:44.484
to the same place. The <i>Sunny</i>
is bound to be there, too.

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:47.453
I guarantee it.
With gusto, even.

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.422
[FRANKY]
You're that confident, huh?

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.891
[DEN] Don't worry, we'll
get there soon enough.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:53.993
On to the Sea Forest!

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:55.995
The Sea Forest?

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.931
[LUFFY laughing]

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.767
Hold on, Luffy!
What are you doing?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.569
Stop! Megalo,
come back here now!

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:06.005
Stay in the palace!

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:11.044
[SHIRAHOSHI] Father, Brothers,
all my caretakers. Forgive me!

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:13.346
I'm leaving without
your permission!

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.286
[SHIRAHOSHI] I promise
to be home by dinner!

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.891
[LUFFY laughs]
We're on an adventure!

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.128
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
What has gotten into Megalo?

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:32.231
I can't believe it!
He even left the doors open!

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:35.702
What if something were
to happen to-- Oh, no!

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:38.771
Hey, skeleton! Hurry up
and check on the Princess!

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:39.639
[BROOK]
All right!

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:41.841
But stop riding
my bones about it!

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.780
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT screams]

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:48.748
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
She's gone!

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.484
Princess Shirahoshi
never leaves her room!

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.019
Oh, no! But why are you

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:54.954
keeping her locked up here
in the first place?

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:56.189
To keep her safe!

00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:58.024
Enemies are trying
to get to her!

00:05:58.057 --> 00:06:00.560
King Neptune. I'm sorry
I've failed you!

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:02.862
Who knows how far away
the kidnappers are!

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:04.364
Kidnappers?!

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:07.734
Princess Shirahoshi!

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:09.736
Forgive me.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.872
You're positive
she was kidnapped?

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:15.742
Ha! How rude of you!

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:18.010
[groans]

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.746
[PIRATES groaning]

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.714
[PIRATE 534B] The gate
connecting Fishman Island

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:23.349
to the Ryugu Palace.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.718
Tell us where the switch
to open it is, or else!

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:27.587
[BROOK]
Wait, switch?

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.788
Skeleton!

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:31.391
You have to get back to King
Neptune as fast as possible!

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:34.427
Tell him the princess is gone
and that we're under attack!

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.229
We didn't want any
of this to happen,

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:38.698
but it's the only way.

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.533
They told us that
if we wanna survive,

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:42.435
we gotta follow their orders.

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:46.706
Please just tell us, okay?

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:47.907
Whose orders?

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.142
It doesn't matter!

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:51.043
Just tell us or
we're all gonna die!

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:51.978
[BROOK]
But I don't--

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:54.547
[PIRATES]
Just tell us!

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.783
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT] What in
the world is going on here?

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:10.863
These guys are so useless!

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:12.799
Humans really are
pathetic, aren't they?

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:15.368
Put 'em in the water
and they just drown!

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:24.710
[DECKEN laughs] You pirates
are now under the control

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:27.013
of Hordy Jones,
so listen closely!

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:29.015
I've got wonderful news!

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:32.218
You have the chance to be
part of a historic mission!

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:34.053
Talk about lucky!

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:35.888
That looks like Vander Decken.

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:38.524
Isn't he the captain
of the <i>Flying Dutchman</i> ?

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:39.759
This can't be real.

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.427
That cursed ghost
ship is a myth!

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.996
[DECKEN]
Oh, I'm no ghost.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.766
But I am Vander
Decken's descendant!

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:49.335
I've got a curse
of my own as well.

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:52.038
Even though I'm a
Fishman, I can't swim.

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.406
But that's all right!

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:56.976
I've got this devil fruit power
known as the Mark-Mark fruit.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:59.045
How 'bout I show you?

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:03.749
You in the stripes! C'mere!

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:04.817
Step right up!

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.052
Me?

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:08.921
[HACHI]
Hordy!

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:10.389
[HORDY]
Huh?

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:18.431
This is nonsense
and you know it!

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:19.699
Enough is enough!

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:22.935
[PIRATES murmuring]

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:23.870
Is that Hachi?

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:26.439
What is he doin' here?

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:27.473
Hello there.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.108
[HACHI] Those Energy
Steroids you're taking

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:31.511
will do nothing but
mess up your body!

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:34.614
And no good can come of
destroying Fishman Island!

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:36.249
On top of it,
you're underestimating

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:37.817
the power of Neptune!

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.787
Hachi. I've heard enough
of your rambling.

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:44.757
I don't wanna listen
to your voice anymore.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.761
To think you were an officer of
the pirate group that I admired.

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:51.230
Now you're nothing
but a washed-up coward.

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:54.467
So, make way for
the real pirates.

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.571
If we wanna teach all
of the humans a lesson,

00:08:58.604 --> 00:09:00.540
we're gonna need
Fishman Island.

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:03.209
That means Neptune is our enemy!

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:06.045
Arlong thought Fishmen
were the supreme race.

00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:07.547
When did you change your mind?

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.583
Arlong was wrong,
there is no supreme race!

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:14.353
Decken! Hyouzou!
Why are you doing this?

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.155
The two of you
refused to help Arlong

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:18.824
invade the East Blue
when he was in power.

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:19.992
So tell me.

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:23.596
What makes you wanna work
with these young punks now?

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.965
That's easy.
I'm in it for money.

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:30.436
These guys are willing to pay.
Arlong was stingy.

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:33.940
He never did pony up enough
dough to enlist my services.

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.508
That's why he was always stuck

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:38.911
taking crappy swordsmen
like you along.

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:40.079
No wonder he lost.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:44.317
[DECKEN laughs] A sight for
sore eyes! An angry Hachi!

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.719
Yeah, I remember what
happened back then.

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:50.356
Arlong had the nerve to ask
me to work underneath him.

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:52.358
What a preposterous idea!

00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:54.727
Vander Decken never
works under anybody.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.362
I'm my own man!

00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:58.798
Hordy gets that
better than anyone.

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:03.069
Arlong had goals and an
ability to act on them,

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:04.770
which I can respect.

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:12.178
But he was also brash.

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:15.081
As a leader, he was
lacking in cunning.

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:17.883
When you old-timers were
running rampant on the sea,

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:20.486
we were all still too
young to become pirates.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:22.254
So we watched.

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:25.391
We saw what you did well
and what you did poorly.

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:27.560
We learned from
all your mistakes.

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:30.796
In that sense,
we owe you our thanks.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.797
Take heart.

00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:34.734
I will continue right
where Arlong left off.

00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:37.470
I don't understand why
you're not onboard with that.

00:10:37.503 --> 00:10:40.940
You supported Arlong for
all those years, after all.

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:44.110
What a disappointment
you are, Hachi.

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:45.544
You might want to know.

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:48.714
The pirate who destroyed
Arlong's dream, Straw Hat Luffy,

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.449
is on Fishman Island.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:53.919
It's a perfect opportunity
for some revenge!

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:55.454
[HACHI] Even though I
fought him as a member

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:59.058
of the Arlong Pirates,
he now calls me his friend!

00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:02.995
[LUFFY] Look. All three
of you are my friends now!

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:05.931
[HACHI] Straw Hat Luffy
also saved my life.

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:08.567
If I could, I would see him...

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:13.973
...but I'm too ashamed of
my fellow Fishmen to do it!

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:17.143
How can I face him when you're
clinging Arlong's legacy?

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:21.147
You consider a human
your friend? How pathetic!

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.617
You're not a real Fishman!
Get outta my sight!

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.551
[HACHI whimpers]

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:28.554
Calm yourself and listen.

00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:32.291
[laughs] You may have
forgotten how pirates

00:11:32.324 --> 00:11:33.726
do things around here.

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:35.695
If there's something
you wanna say,

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:39.031
you gotta use violence
to get your point across!

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:42.601
For example! Watch!

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:44.370
[PIRATE 534J]
Where is he throwing it to?

00:11:44.403 --> 00:11:47.339
Did you notice?
When I touched you earlier,

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:50.142
I marked you as my new target.

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:52.778
No matter what I throw
or where I throw it,

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:56.115
it will always make its way
back to whatever I mark!

00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:59.452
Not only that, but it'll
come back at you full speed!

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:00.953
I suspect!

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:02.188
[screams]

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:03.222
But that's crazy!

00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:05.424
Decken just tossed the
knife away from that guy.

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:07.026
And it came back to hit him!

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.563
[HACHI]
The Mark-Mark curse.

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:13.299
Of course, there are
some limitations.

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:15.367
Can you figure them out?

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.969
You had better hurry.

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:20.139
[growls] Stay away
from me, Decken!

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:21.273
I've heard enough stories

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:24.610
about your Mark-Mark power.
You gotta make him stop!

00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:28.981
He's trying to kill me!
Please stop him, Hordy!

00:12:29.014 --> 00:12:31.050
Sorry, Hachi. I can't.

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:34.653
As he told you earlier, Vander
Decken isn't working under me.

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:36.856
We're allies on equal footing.

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:42.161
Besides, you're really
starting to get on my nerves!

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:43.963
Go ahead, Decken!

00:12:45.564 --> 00:12:46.499
[HACHI]
Damn it!

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:49.435
All right. Voila!

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:54.406
[laughs]

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.776
[DECKEN]
That's it! Run away!

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:01.580
[DECKEN] No matter how fast
you run, or how far you go,

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.483
they'll keep chasing you
until they meet their mark,

00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:07.286
and you know what that means!

00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:10.356
I'll be ok if I can just
find my way to the exit.

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:16.662
[pants] There.
I should be safe now!

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:18.664
Hopefully, they sink
in the water.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.603
[yelps] They burst through the
bubble like it was nothing!

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.205
Get away!

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:46.358
[HACHI screams]

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:06.679
[HACHI screaming]

00:14:09.448 --> 00:14:13.385
[DECKEN laughs]
I can leave up to two marks.

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:16.422
One for each palm!
Left and right!

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:19.358
But I've worn a glove on
this one for ten years,

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:23.128
since I touched Princess
Shiraroshi and made her my mark!

00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:27.166
She'll stay that way forever!

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:28.334
Get it yet?

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:31.403
I can throw weapons
and even my love!

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:34.506
They'll track you down to
the furthest depths of hell!

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.909
That's the Mark-Mark
curse for ya!

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:38.043
Whoa!

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:39.612
He can keep stalking
the princess

00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:42.581
for as long as he wants
and stay right here!

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:44.183
Best of all, he'll
never have to deal

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:46.285
with fighting
Neptune and his sons!

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:47.620
[DECKEN]
Bingo!

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:49.288
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE 534F]
How devious can you get?

00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:51.824
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Decken! Decken! Decken!

00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:54.693
[HORDY]
Now about you human pirates.

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:58.264
I'm sure you're all familiar
with Decken's Mark-Mark power.

00:14:58.297 --> 00:15:01.934
So, let's begin the first
stage of your mission.

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:08.474
[HORDY] They say the
Ryugu Palace is impregnable,

00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:11.477
but I disagree.
Someone in this room

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.946
has been able to break
through its defenses

00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:17.549
for ten straight years. Him.

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.151
Captain Vander Decken.

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:22.688
[DECKEN laughs]

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:25.291
So you'll be
our cannon fodder.

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:30.763
Meaning, Decken will treat your
bodies as living ammunition.

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:33.866
Throwing you straight into the
wall of the princess's tower.

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:34.767
[PIRATES gasp]

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.169
Of course, weapons
can't smash it,

00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:39.672
and most of you runts
won't do any better.

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:46.211
And then, you'll open up the
gate from inside the palace.

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:48.781
Find the gate switch
and let us in.

00:15:48.814 --> 00:15:51.116
That's all you have to do.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.552
No way! We can't
make it that far.

00:15:53.585 --> 00:15:55.587
You're crazy!
We'd already be dead

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.289
from hitting the wall!

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:58.557
You're correct!

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.960
That's why I want
you humans to do it.

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:03.128
Your lives don't
mean anything to me!

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:07.733
In our world, you're
either slaves or corpses.

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:11.370
Those of you who survive the
impact, carry out your duty.

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:14.640
If you succeed in opening
the gate, I'll set you free.

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:17.509
But if you refuse to
do it, then leave!

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:19.778
I'll kick you out
of the bubble myself!

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.680
So you better do as I say!

00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:24.249
But if-if we leave the bubble,

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:26.418
we can't get to the
top without drowning!

00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:27.619
Well, that's no good!

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.121
On the upside, that should make

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:31.623
this decision easy
for you, though.

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:32.658

make it to the king!

to take us to that gate!

question for you guys.

I'm not fighting. I just wanna

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.420
ask them something
about the Ryugu Palace.

00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:37.056
Is she there?
The Mermaid Princess?

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:39.658
Yeah, she's there. So what?

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:41.427

you might die!

she's beautiful, right?

she's quite lovely.

take him in regardless.

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:12.844
You don't wanna get
involved, believe me.

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:16.014
Get back on your boat and leave
this place while you still can,

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:18.383
or you'll be fighting
for your lives.

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:21.320
Hordy and Decken. Go.

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:23.355
The New Fishman pirates
will start attacking

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:24.957
the whole island soon!

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.393
Once they do, the
Ryugu Kingdom will fall!

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:32.364
Ah! King Neptune!

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:33.599
[NEPTUNE]
Hm?

00:20:33.632 --> 00:20:35.367
[THE MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
The princess has been kidnapped!

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.704
I don't know how but they
must've broken into the room!

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:41.206
[BROOK] Also, pirates are
crashing into the tower!

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.341
It's bizarre!

00:20:42.374 --> 00:20:45.210
In any case. They'll
be here any minute!

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:46.712
Get ready!

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:47.713
[NEPTUNE]
Kidnapped?

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:49.848
Somebody's taken
away my Shirahoshi?

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:52.918
Who was it? I'll kill them!

00:20:52.951 --> 00:20:54.920
[screams]

00:20:54.953 --> 00:20:57.256
Wait, there's a pirate
raid going on?

00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:58.657
And they don't mean us?

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.025
This is the worst time!

00:21:00.058 --> 00:21:01.393
All I want is to get out of here

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:03.528
and now it's some
kind of pirate party!

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:06.198
We're screwed!

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:08.934
Fine! Just ignore me, jerk!

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:09.901
I'll cut 'em.

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:13.472
Violence is the last
thing we need right now!

00:21:13.505 --> 00:21:16.174
If we wanna make it
out of here alive,

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:17.943
we have to open up the gate.

00:21:17.976 --> 00:21:19.244
No matter what!

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:21.880
[BROOK]
Oh, no, they're here!

00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:27.386
[MEGALO grunting]

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:29.788
[LUFFY] You can come out
of the shark now, ya know.

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:31.256
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Oh. That's okay,

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.458
I think I'd rather
stay inside for now.

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:35.160
[MEGALO grunts]

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:37.729
[LUFFY] Must be nice, after
being cooped up for ten years.

00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:39.898
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Yes, my heart is racing!

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:42.167
They're probably
worried sick about me.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.269
You've been out five minutes!

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:48.807
Have a little fun, would ya?
Jeez, what a weirdo!

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:52.911
Now I know how it feels.

00:21:54.546 --> 00:21:55.914
[giggles]

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.019
This is a real adventure, huh?

00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:06.658
[LUFFY laughs] It sure is!
If your heart's racing,

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:09.194
it counts as an adventure!

00:22:09.227 --> 00:22:11.830
You mentioned a thing called
"the Sea Forest," right?

00:22:11.863 --> 00:22:15.400
So what is that?
Is it a pretty cool place?

00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:21.006
It's a graveyard.

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:24.476
Or rather, there's one grave
that I never got to visit,

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:29.848
because I was locked away.
Ten years, I've wanted to go,

00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:33.352
and now my only dream
can finally come true.

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:43.228
[JIMBEI]
It's already been ten long years

00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:45.364
since her assassination
in broad daylight

00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:48.367
threw Fishman Island
into upheaval.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.268
Time flies.

00:22:51.903 --> 00:22:54.139
[JIMBEI] The princes
have grown into strong

00:22:54.172 --> 00:22:56.141
and worthy protectors.

00:22:56.174 --> 00:23:02.214
Princess Shirahoshi is locked
in the tower, but she is safe.

00:23:02.247 --> 00:23:05.917
But as for you.
Your memory survives.

00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:09.421
Your ideals will
live on forever.

00:23:09.454 --> 00:23:11.323
Queen Otohime!

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.995
[NARRATOR] Hordy's plan for
revenge is set into motion.

00:23:17.028 --> 00:23:20.232
The defenses of the Ryugu Palace
have been left wide open

00:23:20.265 --> 00:23:22.434
thanks to the unexpected
actions of the pirates

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:23.869
thrown into its walls.

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:26.138
The Straw Hats, who have
unwittingly taken control

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:27.739
of the palace,
must now defend it

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:29.574
against the New
Fishman Pirates,

00:23:29.608 --> 00:23:32.711
who pour into its halls,
lead by Hordy himself.

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:34.279
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:35.814
"Hordy's Onslaught!

00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:38.550
The Retaliatory Plan
Set Into Motion!"

00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:40.886
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
