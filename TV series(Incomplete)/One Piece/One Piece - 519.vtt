[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:07.841
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:10.643
Smiling, even as he stood
upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.979
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.180
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.281
You can have it!

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.984
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.387
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.322

Two years have passed

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.724
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:39.225
Scattered across the world,

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.327
Luffy and his crew
underwent special training

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.396
to prepare for the trials ahead.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.099
Now, they return to the
Sabaody Archipelago

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:48.301
and move forward to next
stage of their journey:

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.170

Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:50.563
I hope you weren't lonely.

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:55.235

Now who is that gorgeous lady?

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.545
It's Robin, of course!

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.114
Our super archaeologist!

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.955
Boy, did I miss you!

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.185
[chuckles] You haven't
changed a bit, Franky!

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.022
[FRANKY] Is that a joke,

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.556
No, I'm more than a man!

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:04.537
Yeah, baby! I'm beyond
human comprehension!

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.738
Fair enough.

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:07.473
Though I might argue
that you've been that way

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:08.708
for quite some time now.

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:12.378
[FRANKY] Huh? So, I'm not just
a freak, I'm a super freak?

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:15.114
Ha! You're gonna make me blush!

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.326
This is the coating, I take it?

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.561
Hah. It's like jelly.

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:29.462
Yep!

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.164
Took a little longer
than we expected,

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:33.066
but Rayleigh did his part!

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.101
Bottom of the sea, here we come!

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:37.103
After everyone gets
back, of course.

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:39.939
Speaking of which,
I saw Rayleigh at the bar.

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:42.175
[FRANKY]
Oh, yeah? What number were you?

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.643
Who're we missin'?

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.411
I was number eight.

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.747
So, the only one left is him.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.848
Luffy.

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:51.651
Well, I'm sure our captain'll
show up soon enough.

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:54.020
The ship's ready whenever he is.

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.591
New weapon's ready, too.

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:00.693

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:02.462
That sounds just splendid.

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:05.131
By the way, where is
everyone else? Busy?

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:07.767
Usopp and Sanji stopped
by here earlier.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.169
Usopp's pickin' up some
fuel for the trip.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.538
Sanji's getting
groceries, of course.

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:16.843
I see. I ran into something
interesting on the way over.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:18.644
Have you seen these?

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:19.712

Huh?

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:21.681
It's for a concert today.

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:23.783
He's calling himself
"Soul King."

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:26.185
Yeah, there's a
story behind that.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.453
He's big news now.

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:31.524

all over the place.

far behind.

Huh?

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:38.464
[FRANKY] He rose up
from those foggy seas

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:40.299
and now he's a shining star.

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.235
His fans raise his name
to the heavens,

if you'll pardon my poetry.

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:52.979
[FRANKY] He didn't say
anything about this to me,

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:56.315
but he's makin' a lot of
people happy with his music.

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:59.585

Understood! Then we'd
better move quickly.

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:04.390
Evacuate the locals before
this becomes a war zone!

00:12:04.423 --> 00:12:05.558
[MARINE B]
Roger!

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:07.593
Pirates are gathering
at Grove 46.

00:12:07.626 --> 00:12:09.595
Our targets are the Straw Hats.

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:11.630
We'll engage them in
the lawless zone.

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:13.265
They may have reinforcements!

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:14.900
Block all routes of escape!

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:18.471
Close in on them from
Groves 40, 42, and 44!

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:20.005
Make it snappy!

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:22.675
G1 is sending in backup now!

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:27.046
[MARINES gasp]

00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:31.117
[MARINE G]
Sentomaru, sir!

00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:34.320
I'm heading in first.

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:38.290
PX-5 and PX-7 will accompany me.

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:41.761
[MARINE G] Whoa. You're
deploying Pacifistas, sir?

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:45.264
[SENTOMARU]
Of course I am!

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:46.465
You fools.

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:49.969
Haven't you learned not to
underestimate the Straw Hats?

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:52.338
It's been two years
since the war.

00:12:52.371 --> 00:12:55.441
Surely they've only grown
stronger during that time.

00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:57.777
They may be rookies,
but make no mistake,

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.246
they're the most
dangerous pirates here.

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:05.284
[SENTOMARU]
As for what happened last time,

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:06.719
we were never able to determine

00:13:06.752 --> 00:13:09.989
why Kuma sent them away instead
of apprehending them.

00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:15.294
[SENTOMARU] But even after
his personality was wiped,

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:16.796
his actions seemed to indicate

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:19.131
that they would be
returning here someday.

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:20.900
And now that they have,

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.735
we must ensure that
this doesn't end

00:13:22.768 --> 00:13:24.537
like it did two years ago.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.672
Let's move!

00:13:55.434 --> 00:13:56.936
[LUFFY]
Oh, it's moving.

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:58.571
Must be getting close.

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:05.544
[ALL groaning]

00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:07.279
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:12.351
[THUGS chuckling]

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:16.255
I got plenty more where
that came from, buddy boy.

00:14:16.288 --> 00:14:19.124
Damn it! Run for it!

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.395
[LUFFY]
Hmm...

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:28.067
[LUFFY] I don't remember so
many pirates here last time.

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:33.906
Uhh... Guess I should
put that thing on, huh?

00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:37.877
Why don't you stop
wasting my time

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.078
and give me a real discount?

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:42.481
Please don't be angry!
I'm doing my best!

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:46.218
But, c'mon, I can't take 50% off
no matter how much you buy.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:47.953
They're marked down
enough already!

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:49.221
Okay. Stop.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:52.258
You can buy clothes when we get
to Fishman Island, all right?

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:53.893
We're supposed to buy fuel!

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:56.228
Well, too bad!

00:14:56.262 --> 00:14:57.263
[USOPP]
Huh?

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:00.399
[NAMI]
You drive a hard bargain.

00:15:00.432 --> 00:15:04.103
I'll buy these too,
but I want 90% off.

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:06.472
[SALESMAN A]
Why me?!

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:08.908
[USOPP] Were you learning
science these last two years

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:11.377
or just learning how
to rip people off?

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.985
Hey, Moss Head, keep up.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:22.321
I don't want you gettin'
lost in the crowd.

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:25.090
If you wander off again,
we'll set sail without you.

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:26.358
Yeah?

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:30.195
Then at least I wouldn't be seen
with you, and your mouth brow.

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:32.598
Hey, I look good.

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:35.334
Hm? Somethin' smells nice.

00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:40.506
Ooh, I could go
for some of that.

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:41.573
[VENDOR A]
Hi!

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:45.444
Well, like what you see?

00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:47.346
Ah! You bet I do!

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:49.782
A real-life lady with
succulent meat!

00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:52.484
[SANJI laughing]

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:54.687
[SANJI]
Uh.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.289
That bastard, he did run off!

00:15:57.323 --> 00:16:00.125
I wanna go fishing, but I
don't have a fishing pole.

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:02.995
Ooh. Look, a fishing store.

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:04.563
[growls]

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:07.499
Son of a-- Where did he go?

00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:16.709
[CHOPPER]
Robin!

00:16:16.742 --> 00:16:18.677
Where did they take her?

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:23.382
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:25.017
Damn it!

00:16:26.418 --> 00:16:27.920
[CHOPPER]
None of this makes sense!

00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:30.689
Why are they acting that way?

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:36.362
Luffy, Zoro, Nami,
Sanji, Franky.

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:39.264
What happened to them? Why?

00:16:40.432 --> 00:16:43.969
Robin gets taken away,
and you don't care?

00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:48.040
What's wrong with you?

00:16:48.073 --> 00:16:51.076
I've been working so hard
these past two years

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.178
to be a better doctor.

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:54.813
But for what?

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:00.753
[USOPP]
Chopper!

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:01.954
Hey!

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.358
[NAMI]
Yoo-hoo! Over here!

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:07.626
[USOPP laughs]

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:11.096
I could tell it was you
from a mile away!

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.132
[CHOPPER]
Ah!

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:14.533
It's Usopp!

00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:17.970
[USOPP] Jeez, you got so big!
Just look at you!

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:20.973
I bet I could even ride
on your back, couldn't I?

00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:22.374
You doin' okay?

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:23.542
Uh-huh!

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:28.313
So cuddly! I'm sure the lady
reindeers just adore you!

00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:31.550
I missed you, Chopper. So much!

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:33.385
Uhh...

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:35.954
Uh, Nami?

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:37.523
Uh-huh?

00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:39.925
Wait a second!

00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.760
I'm happy to see
you guys and all,

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:43.662
but now's not the time for this.

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:45.931
Robin is in serious trouble!

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.406
Huh? They're just
pretending to be you?

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.941
That's why there's two Namis?

00:17:55.974 --> 00:17:57.276
[NAMI sighs]

00:17:57.309 --> 00:17:58.977
Use your head, okay?

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:02.581
Robin was able to avoid
the government for 20 years.

00:18:02.614 --> 00:18:04.583
Do you really think someone
could just grab her

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:05.918
and stuff her in a bag?

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:07.519
No offense, but come on!

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:08.487
I see!

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.322
I have a tough time
telling humans apart,

00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:13.125
but she didn't even smell right.

00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:15.360
[growls]

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:17.596
Darn it, now I'm
starting to get mad!

00:18:17.629 --> 00:18:18.964
If we see one of them again,

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:21.633
I'm gonna punch 'em
in their big, fake face!

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:24.503
They've got some nerve,
pretending to be us!

00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:27.172
I mean, why would they do
that in the first place?

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:28.941
[CHOPPER chuckles]

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:31.477
It's almost like we're
celebrities or something.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.178
That's crazy!

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:35.514
Hey, don't let it
go to your head.

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:37.282
Although you aren't
that far off,

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:39.485
since our captain worked
up quite a reputation

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:41.053
for fighting in that war.

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:44.123
[CHOPPER] Hah. I have to
come up with a cool autograph.

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:45.958
[USOPP]
Heh. I've already got one!

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:48.794
[NAMI] Come on, you two,
we're famous criminals,

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:50.496
not celebrities.

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:59.738
[FAKE SANJI]
Chopper! Where'd you go?

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:01.807
[FAKE ZORO]
Come back!

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.741
[FAKE SANJI]
Ugh. This sucks!

00:19:02.774 --> 00:19:04.810
That little dude was
their pet for real!

00:19:04.843 --> 00:19:07.346
He, like, doubled
our credibility!

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:10.315
Ow, my side hurts.

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:11.884
Are you nuts?

00:19:11.917 --> 00:19:13.986
That talking stuffed
animal thing was part

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:16.822
of the real Straw Hats
and you let it get away?

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:18.657
Why didn't you tell me?

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.759
And why aren't you
looking for it?

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:22.494
[FAKE SANJI, FAKE ZORO whimper]

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:23.896
Oh, sure, go look for him.

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:25.764
Like we have any idea
where he went!

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:29.368
Yeah, I mean, Sabaody is super
big and that guy was teeny tiny.

00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:32.538
I can't do this.
I am dyin' here!

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:39.211
Forget runnin'.
We'll walk. Power walk.

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:41.480
Hancock was right.

00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:44.583
With all the pirates around,
this mustache is pretty handy.

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:47.152
I don't wanna fight with
those guys anyway.

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:51.690
[FAKE SANJI] Look! It's that
kid with the backpack!

00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:54.393
Maybe our luck ain't
so bad after all!

00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:55.561
[FAKE ZORO]
Boss called him a "kid,"

00:19:55.594 --> 00:19:59.097
but he kinda looks like
an old man to me.

00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:01.433
Oh, it's you guys.

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:06.405
Hey, friend. We need
you to come with us.

00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:08.473
Let's do this nice
and quiet, okay?

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:09.908
We don't want any trouble.

00:20:09.942 --> 00:20:12.377
[FAKE SANJI] You really pissed
off our captain, kiddo.

00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:15.581
I'd prepare for the
worst if I was you.

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:18.150
What's wrong? You so scared
you can't even talk?

00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:20.452
Hey, Sanji. How's it goin'?

00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:21.386
[FAKE SANJI yelps]

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.088
And Zoro, too. Wow!

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:25.090
Long time no see, huh, guys?

00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:28.093
[FAKE ZORO]
Oh. Uh-huh! Too long, right?

00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:31.730
Yeah, well, let's
get goin' then. Heh.

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:33.899
You mean the rest of
the crew's here already?

00:20:33.932 --> 00:20:37.469
Sorry I was so late!
Good thing you found me!

00:20:41.974 --> 00:20:45.143
Well, he knows the Straw Hats,
but we don't know him.

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:46.345
Like I care!

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:49.448
Just take him to Luffy
and he'll sort this out!

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:56.688
Why you bein' such
an ass about this?

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:57.823
I just wanna go fish.

00:20:57.856 --> 00:20:59.424
Well, too bad, you can't!

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:00.959
[ZORO]
Give me one good reason!

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:02.694
And while you're at it,
give me one good reason

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:04.529
why I should even listen to you!

00:21:04.563 --> 00:21:06.865
I don't wanna hang out together
any more than you do,

00:21:06.898 --> 00:21:08.667
but I can't let you get lost!

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.035
Don't get me wrong, though.

00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:12.938
Nothing would make me happier
than leaving you here for good.

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:14.172
Too bad, huh?

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:16.275
The point is, everyone's
meeting on the ship,

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:18.877
so you don't get to go
fishing on your own!

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.279
[ZORO]
Tch.

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:21.813
[groans]

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:23.515
What a joke.

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:27.019
Number seven thinks he can
talk crap to number one

00:21:27.052 --> 00:21:28.654
and get away with it.

00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:31.556
You think you're better than me
just 'cause you got here first?

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.226
It's not like everyone swam
to Sabaody, all right?

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:36.395
You got nothin' to brag about!

00:21:36.428 --> 00:21:40.565
Sure, whatever you
say, number seven.

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:43.201
Fine! You wanna fight me?

00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:46.805
I trained these legs on the
shores of hell for two years!

00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:48.540
[ZORO]
Then you better use them to run.

00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:50.175
'Cause I will cut you in half!

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:53.945
[ZORO, SANJI yelling]

00:21:56.615 --> 00:22:02.621
[PIRATE chattering]

00:22:14.366 --> 00:22:17.269
[MARINE H]
Reporting from Grove 46.

00:22:17.302 --> 00:22:18.737
All the new recruits
the Straw Hats

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.872
picked up are gathering here,
and from the looks of things,

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:23.175
I'd say there might be
nearly a hundred of them.

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:24.409
Most of them are nobodies,

00:22:24.443 --> 00:22:26.678
but there are four
captains at least.

00:22:26.712 --> 00:22:30.615
I see "Gashed" Albion for one.
He's worth 92 million.

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:32.417
Then there's
"Lip-Service" Doughty,

00:22:32.451 --> 00:22:36.588
who's worth 88 million.

00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:39.925
But those aren't the ones
I'm really worried about.

00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:43.929
They've also got "Wet-Haired"
Caribou, worth 210 million.

00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:47.199
The captain of his crew.

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:50.769
He brought his brother with him,
"Blood Splatter" Coribou.

00:22:50.802 --> 00:22:54.539
His bounty's at 190 million.

00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:55.640
[CARIBOU]
Huh?

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:08.253
[CARIBOU]
Ahh...

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.396
[NARRATOR] While the Straw Hats
continue to gather at the Sunny,

00:23:17.429 --> 00:23:19.564
the fake Straw Hats plan
a gathering of their own,

00:23:19.598 --> 00:23:22.300
attracting the attention
of the Navy.

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.469
As soldiers storm
Brook's concert,

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:26.838
the self-styled Soul King
is forced to perform

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:28.407
his final show.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.442
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:30.475 --> 00:23:34.579
"Big Guns Assembled! The Danger
of the Fake Straw Hats!"

00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:36.948
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
