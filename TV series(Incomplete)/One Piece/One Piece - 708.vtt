00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.447
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.354
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:45.565
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.003
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.376
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.313
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.785
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:58.625
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:02.832
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:04.334
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:08.376
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.819
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:17.127
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.764
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:20.701
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:24.308
and launched an attack on
Doflamingo in Dressrosa.

00:03:25.611 --> 00:03:27.716
[NARRATOR] In response,
Doflamingo trapped the kingdom

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:31.422
inside a barrier and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:32.592 --> 00:03:33.861
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:36.332
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:38.336
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:41.510
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:42.812 --> 00:03:45.050
[LAW] What do make of
Monkey D. Luffy?

00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:46.118
I have to ask you!

00:03:46.152 --> 00:03:47.488
Huh?

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:49.358
[LAW] You were once
a Celestial Dragon.

00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:52.264
You must have something
interesting to say.

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.368
[LAW]
Shambles!

00:03:57.308 --> 00:04:00.280
[LAW] What do make of
the "Will of D."?

00:04:14.108 --> 00:04:16.279
[DOFLAMINGO]
Why should I indulge you?

00:04:16.312 --> 00:04:19.285
That's none of your concern!

00:04:19.318 --> 00:04:21.355
You think that this is his fate?

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.863
Huh? That Straw Hat
was lead here?

00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:30.073
My divine blood enticed him
to come and kill me?

00:04:30.107 --> 00:04:33.046
A bunch of nonsense!

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:34.214
[ROSINANTE]
One more thing.

00:04:34.248 --> 00:04:36.052
Those who fear
the inheritors of D.

00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:37.823
have given them another title.

00:04:37.856 --> 00:04:40.326
"Sworn enemy of gods"!

00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:43.233
I'm also a "D."!

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:47.374
You're a "D."?
You have a hidden name?

00:04:47.408 --> 00:04:49.812
And you're destined to
come here and defeat me?

00:04:49.846 --> 00:04:51.883
Is that what you're
trying to say?

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.252
You think you can stop me

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:55.023
because of some
letter in your name?

00:04:55.057 --> 00:04:58.429
That you're the sworn enemy
of the gods, driven by fate?

00:04:58.462 --> 00:04:59.599
That's rubbish!

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:00.835
A legend!

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:02.572
Just a lie!

00:05:04.442 --> 00:05:06.412
[LAW]
Injection...

00:05:08.884 --> 00:05:10.053
[LAW]
...Shot!

00:05:12.558 --> 00:05:14.128
[LAW] Cora knew that
it would take more than

00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:16.633
a measly "D." to defeat you.

00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:19.338
And yet, when I
learned the truth,

00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:22.679
my fate changed all the same.

00:05:22.712 --> 00:05:23.947
Listen.

00:05:25.518 --> 00:05:27.555
[ROSINANTE]
I love you, kid!

00:05:30.494 --> 00:05:32.632
[LAW] I'm only here because
Cora was too kindhearted

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.468
to pull the trigger that day.

00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:38.476
So now, I'm going to
do it for him!

00:05:58.082 --> 00:06:00.119

[LAW grunts]

00:06:09.037 --> 00:06:11.476
So, that was it?

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.047
Pulled your trigger
and now we're done?

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:41.736
[LAW panting]

00:06:54.395 --> 00:06:56.967

I don't like this one bit.

counting on that to hit!

You must be real sad! [laughs]

Hey! Are you ignoring me?

Not even gonna look at me?

00:07:58.355 --> 00:08:00.594
Are you crying?

00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:06.205
[laughs] Too bad!

00:08:06.238 --> 00:08:08.911
I thought you were gonna
do something cool earlier,

00:08:08.944 --> 00:08:10.748
but guess not!

00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:12.952
You're not all talk, are ya?

00:08:12.985 --> 00:08:16.593

[DOFLAMINGO]
I'm so disappointed in you.

if you're smart.

00:16:30.547 --> 00:16:34.254
But you weren't smart at all.
Instead, you were emotional.

00:16:34.287 --> 00:16:35.858
And the moment
you decided you had to

00:16:35.891 --> 00:16:38.864
avenge Corazon with
your own two hands,

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:42.203
you condemned yourself
to certain death.

00:16:49.853 --> 00:16:51.822
All this talk reminds me.

00:16:51.856 --> 00:16:55.062
Do you remember
that secret message?

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.504
It's not a trick.

00:16:58.537 --> 00:16:59.605
If a Marine sees this,

00:16:59.638 --> 00:17:02.310
they would know exactly
what to do with it.

00:17:02.343 --> 00:17:05.851
This one little package
will save a country.

00:17:05.884 --> 00:17:08.957
A faraway kingdom
called Dressrosa.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.393
I don't get it.

00:17:10.426 --> 00:17:12.765
[VERGO]
A secret message?

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:17.007
I don't know who gave this
to you, but I'm grateful.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.843
I'll take good care of this.

00:17:18.877 --> 00:17:21.081
So don't you worry.

00:17:24.088 --> 00:17:26.058
[DOFLAMINGO]
Corazon did a splendid job

00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:29.330
of undermining me
to save this kingdom.

00:17:30.499 --> 00:17:35.343
Everything was gonna work out
fine, until you blew it.

00:17:35.376 --> 00:17:40.252
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
That face says you do remember.

00:17:41.155 --> 00:17:43.125
And it must sting, too.

00:17:43.158 --> 00:17:47.400
You're responsible for
Corazon's death as much as me.

00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:51.509
[DOFLAMINGO] Imagine how
history might have changed.

00:17:51.543 --> 00:17:56.051
Every tragedy that befell this
kingdom could have been avoided,

00:17:56.084 --> 00:17:59.490
if only you'd
delivered that message.

00:18:01.428 --> 00:18:04.200
[LAW]
Even you don't believe that.

00:18:05.804 --> 00:18:08.610
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:18:08.643 --> 00:18:10.847
[DOFLAMINGO]
Didn't lose your cool this time.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.119
You're learning.

00:18:13.152 --> 00:18:14.755
And yes, you're right!

00:18:14.788 --> 00:18:18.763
Even with that message,
I would have found a way.

00:18:18.796 --> 00:18:23.472
No matter what, the throne
would still have been mine.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.964
[DOFLAMINGO] That means Corazon
sacrificed himself for nothing.

00:18:35.997 --> 00:18:38.402
The effort he put forth
was meaningless.

00:18:38.436 --> 00:18:41.509
The only one who can
decide that is me!

00:18:43.947 --> 00:18:46.953
Everything that I do,
until I die,

00:18:46.986 --> 00:18:49.091
is a part of Cora's legacy!

00:18:49.124 --> 00:18:50.493
Well, is that so!

00:18:50.527 --> 00:18:53.800
Why, that almost brings a tear
to your eye, doesn't it?

00:18:55.235 --> 00:18:56.405
[DOFLAMINGO]
But it's true.

00:18:56.438 --> 00:18:59.177
Everything that's done,
for better or worse,

00:18:59.211 --> 00:19:02.317
becomes a part of your legacy,
etched in stone.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.189
Like when you ate
the Op-Op Fruit and ran away.

00:19:05.223 --> 00:19:08.395
Or when you bared your fangs
at me on Punk Hazard.

00:19:08.429 --> 00:19:12.671
Or when you came here and
challenged me in my own kingdom!

00:19:15.242 --> 00:19:17.380
[LAW screams]

00:19:19.885 --> 00:19:26.899
[LAW screaming]

00:19:29.137 --> 00:19:31.810
[laughs] That was
a good one, Doffy!

00:19:31.843 --> 00:19:36.184
[laughs] Nothing beats
the good old String Saw, huh?

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.021
[LAW screams]

00:19:38.055 --> 00:19:41.763
[TREBOL] I'm really loving
those screams, Law! Keep it up!

00:19:41.796 --> 00:19:44.200
[TREBOL laughs]

00:19:46.372 --> 00:19:48.777
It's time for Second Gear!

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.417
[BELLAMY yells]

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.988
Coming through! Sorry!

00:19:57.126 --> 00:19:59.699
C'mon, Fake Mingo!

00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:04.373
Gum-Gum Red Hawk!

00:20:10.219 --> 00:20:17.299
[yelling]

00:20:19.003 --> 00:20:22.243
Go away! [grunts]

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:28.656
I gotta hurry and
beat the real Mingo!

00:20:28.689 --> 00:20:35.670
[LAW groaning]

00:20:38.877 --> 00:20:41.882
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:20:41.916 --> 00:20:45.122
Maybe you were influenced
by the other "D."

00:20:45.156 --> 00:20:49.030
But as I said, everything that's
happened is etched in stone now.

00:20:49.063 --> 00:20:51.468
There's no changing the truth.

00:20:51.502 --> 00:20:54.407
And that's why I forgive you.

00:21:00.721 --> 00:21:04.995
[DOFLAMINGO] Like I forgave my
father and forgave my brother.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.370
That is to say in death.

00:21:09.404 --> 00:21:12.811
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:21:12.844 --> 00:21:14.381
[LAW]
No!

00:21:14.414 --> 00:21:18.556
Let's go! Jet Gatling!

00:21:19.357 --> 00:21:25.503
[yelling]

00:21:44.541 --> 00:21:49.551
Nothing beats a lead bullet
for a proper execution, I say.

00:21:51.756 --> 00:21:53.593
There you have it.

00:21:53.626 --> 00:21:56.799
At least one trigger's
getting pulled.

00:22:16.505 --> 00:22:19.845
[TREBOL gasps]
That's Doffy's double!

00:22:22.083 --> 00:22:26.959
Mingo! It's time to fight!

00:22:29.197 --> 00:22:30.567
He did it!

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.944
[TREBOL gasps] This is awful!
He got all busted up!

00:22:51.609 --> 00:22:55.415
I suppose the cage was
a bit too small, huh?

00:23:00.425 --> 00:23:01.996
[DOFLAMINGO]
I should've known you wouldn't

00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:04.568
be so easy to contain.

00:23:04.602 --> 00:23:07.439
[LUFFY]
Hey! Did you hear me?

00:23:13.753 --> 00:23:16.692
[NARRATOR] Hajrudin enters a
grueling struggle with Machvise

00:23:16.726 --> 00:23:19.297
and soon finds himself
pummeled into the ground

00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:20.667
beneath his weight.

00:23:20.701 --> 00:23:22.871
But remembering the debt
he owes Luffy and his crew,

00:23:22.905 --> 00:23:25.877
the giant stands tall again
and unleashes an attack

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.417
that echoes with
the spirit of Elbaf itself!

00:23:29.451 --> 00:23:30.988
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.021 --> 00:23:34.127
"A Decisive Battle
Against the Executives!

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.797
Proud Hajrudin!"

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:39.036
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
