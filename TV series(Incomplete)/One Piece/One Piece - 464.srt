[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,661
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,964
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,766
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,470
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,071
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,174
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,977
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,813
they capture the
unwanted attention of

10
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,247
the World Government,

11
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,783
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:10,190
I can't wait to see what kind
of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:13,293
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:18,398
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,970
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of his crew,

17
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,838
Luffy is rushing to Navy HQ

18
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,275
to rescue his brother
Ace, from execution.

19
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,912
Meanwhile on Marineford,
home of Navy HQ,

20
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:34,648
the epic war over Ace's
life between the Navy

21
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,784
and the Whitebeard
Pirates has begun!

22
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,988

Hm. My fault.

00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,669
I really should've known better.

28
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,905
If your boss was
that easy to kill,

29
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:01,141
you wouldn't be here
right now, would you?

30

[JOZU growls]

31
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:06,146

If we all left our posts...

...there'd be no one
here to do their job.

00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:03,570
[WHITEBEARD grunts] Think I'll
have ya light the candles

39
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:07,107
for my next birthday,
ya magma punk.

40
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:14,115
I'd rather provide the
lighting for your funeral.

How utterly repulsive.

48
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,118
Men are bothersome
enough at normal size.

178
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:08,281
[OARS JR. growls]

179
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,051
No, Oars!

180
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,222
Ah, damn it!

181
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,951
I'm gonna save you now, Ace.

182
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,052
Stop...

183
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,136
Nuthin' to fear!

184
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:09,769
Prepare yourself
for the Ursa Shock.

185
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,282
[ACE gasping]

186
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,721
[ALL groaning]

187
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:38,064
[COBY, HELMEPPO yell]

188
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:09,629
Stop!

189
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,604
Oars!

190
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,573
That's enough!

191
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:23,243
They won't let you reach me!

192
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,060
[ACE]
Hey, buddy...

193
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:43,096
[OARS JR.]
Huh?

194
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,065
[ACE] It's hard to tell
from all the way down here,

195
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,534
but I can't help but wonder...

196
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,736
Don't you get hot?

197
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,939
Just bein' closer
to the sun and all?

198
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:59,212
[OARS JR.]
I am hot.

199
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,547
[ACE]
I figured.

200
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,283
Hey y'know what?

201
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:05,486
We're gonna have to
get you some shade!

202
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,888
[ALL]
No, Captain Oars!

203
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,090
[OARS JR. grunts]

204
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:15,596
[SENGOKU]
Don't tell me he can still move.

205
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:16,764
Lovely!

206
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:20,234
He's every bit as resilient
as the other Oars!

207
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,236
[OARS JR.]
You made this?

208
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:29,276
Yeah, some folks I met in the
Wano Kingdom taught me how.

209
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,944
Try it on.

210
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,214
[PIRATE A]
Ace ruined two others

211
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:37,184
before he got that one right.
They burned to a crisp.

212
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,251
[PIRATE B]
That's what happens

213
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,287
when someone who's made
of fire weaves straw!

214
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,322
[PIRATES laugh]

215
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,628
Wow, it's nice and
cool under here!

216
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:48,729
Then it works!

217
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,364
I like the look!

218
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:53,400
[ACE whimpers]

219
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,742
[MARINE EE]
Aim and fire!

220
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:12,118
[ACE gasping]

221
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,087
Oars!

222
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,522
Run away, man!

223
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:17,357
You're an easy target now!

224
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:19,793
[OARS JR. groaning]

225
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,633
[OARS PIRATE A]
Hey, Captain Oars!

226
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,436
What're you doing
outside in the rain?

227
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:34,374
[OARS JR.]
Rain or shine, I'm doin' fine!

228
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:39,112
I don't get wet anymore!
Wow, I love this hat!

229
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:52,058
[OARS JR.]
I still can't reach him.

230
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,435
[OARS JR.]
If I can't save you

231
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:07,708
at least I can take out
one of the Warlords!

232
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:08,508
[DOFLAMINGO]
Hm?

233
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,443
[OARS JR. roars]

234
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,752
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

235
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:25,025
[OARS JR. gronaing]

236
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,226
[DOFLAMINGO]
Why'd you stop?

237
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,062
Ace is right there!

238
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:30,964
[OARS JR.]
Ow, my foot...

239
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,999
[OARS PIRATE B]
Captain!

240
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,902
[OARS PIRATE B]
Hey, Captain!

241
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:37,171
You're gonna stay outside again?

242
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:38,605
[OARS JR.]
Why should I care?!

243
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,508
The snow's not gettin'
on my head.

244
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:47,581
In the heat or the cold,
this hat never gets old!

245
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:51,952
You're the best, Ace!

246
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,153
[OARS JR. groans]

247
00:20:55,923 --> 00:21:01,128
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

248
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:03,431
Now that was fun.

249
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:05,832
[laughs]

250
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:09,870
Oars!

251
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:27,087
[OARS JR. groaning]

252
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:31,992
[MARINE N]
Wait, he's still moving?

253
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:36,830
[MARINE FF]
He's infiltrated the plaza!

254
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:44,271
[ACE whimpering]

255
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:47,541
Gotta go a little bit more.

256
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:50,244
[ACE whimpering]

257
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:56,550
[OARS JR.] Don't worry,
Ace, I can make it for sure!

258
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,085
[ACE whimpering]

259
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,258
That damn Doflamingo!

260
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,226
He knew I wanted Oars intact!

261
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:09,262
You don't cut the foot off
a corpse someone's claimed!

262
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:11,365
Doppelman!

263
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:12,466
[MARINES gasp]

264
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,568
Finish him!

265
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:17,204
Spiky Shadow Lizard!

266
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:21,374
[ACE]
No!

267
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:25,545
[OARS JR. groaning]

268
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:33,453
[ACE whimpering]

269
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:38,425
[OARS JR. groaning]

270
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,294
I made it, Ace.

271
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,529
I'm here to save you.

272
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,564
[ACE whimpers]

273
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:08,221
[OARS JR.]
Ace!

274
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,229
[NARRATOR]
After Oars Jr. risks his life

275
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:16,629
to pave the way forward,

276
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:19,799
the Whitebeard Pirates rush
for the execution platform.

277
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,602
However, just as
their resuce mission

278
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:23,203
begins to pick up momentum,

279
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:26,606
Sengoku employs a surprise
tactic that turns the tide

280
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,674
yet again.

281
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,376
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

282
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:33,413
"Jusice for the Winners!
Sengoku's Strategy in Action!"

283
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:36,149
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
