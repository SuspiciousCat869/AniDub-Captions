[MISS VALENTINE]
Hey! Isn't this the ugly bird

179
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,908
that the princess is always
hanging around with?

180
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,209
[screams]

181
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,377
[Mr. 5]
Yeah.

182
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,057
[laughs]

[screams]

185
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,932
Don't leave.

00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,900
[KAROO screams]

187
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,803
Well now, we're happy
we ran into you.

188
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,238
In fact, there's a little
somethin' we'd like

189
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,740
to ask you to do for us.

190
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,075
Oh, yeah.

191
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:46,752
[ZORO grunting]

192
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,154
This isn't good.

193
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,655
I'm lost.

194
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,623
This tree looks familiar,

195
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,959
but it's kinda hard
to tell in this place.

196
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,827
I think I was supposed to
take a left at the tree

197
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,796
wrapped in vines.

198
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,766
[ZORO]
Oh. Hey, Nami, it's you!

199
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,435
Seems I got lost.

200
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,103
Looks like you got
some pretty good timing.

201
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,972
I wasn't sure what
I was gonna do.

202
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:10,176
So what are you doin'
in this area anyway, huh?

203
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,278
Uh... Nami?

204
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,449
[USOPP screams]

205
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,684
Oh, crap, it's another dinosaur!

206
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,219
Get away, get away,
get away, get away,

207
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,454
get away, get away!

208
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,291
Usopp, wait up!

209
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:30,329
[panting]

210
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,964
Luffy!

211
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,000
[NAMI]
Boy, is it a relief to see you!

212
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,901
So what are you
doing here, anyway?

213
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,376
[gasps, yelps]

214
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,177

215
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,152
[USOPP]
Uh, Nami?

00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:59,158
[DINOSAURS squawking]

217
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:16,909
[USOPP]
Nami! Nami! Nami! Nami!

218
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,444
Where did she go?!

219
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:23,683
Luffy!

220
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,602
[screaming]

221
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,204

Luffy!

00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,541

00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,976
Luffy!

224
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,879
[USOPP groans]

225
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,086
[USOPP] I have terrible news:
A dinosaur ate Nami!

226
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,554
What? No way!

227
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,055
We were running through
the jungle to get away

228
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,957
from the dinosaur, and then
suddenly, I turned around

229
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,827
and she was gone!
It must've gotten her!

230
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,496
I got my friend killed!

231
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,897
How can I live with myself now?!

232
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,666
[screaming]

233
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,569
[VIVI]
Hey, you guys, calm down.

234
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,605
Just listen to me for
a second, will you?!

235
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,141
If she was there one
moment and gone the next,

236
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,810
then... you can't know
for sure what happened.

237
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,912
Well, no, it's not like
I could stop and check!

238
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:27,980
I would've been eaten, too!

239
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,249
It was either a dinosaur
or some other wild beast.

240
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,251
What else could it possibly be?!

241
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,120
I don't know for sure.

242
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,856
But, if Baroque Works followed
us from Whiskey Peak,

243
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,924
it would make sense for
them to capture Nami,

244
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,861
and not you. I think we
may be in great danger.

245
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,129
We should go.

246
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,164
[gasps] You mean
that Baroque Works

247
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,167
is here on the island with us?!

248
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,938
Wait. But why capture
Nami and not me.

249
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,974
[VIVI] Because you haven't
gotten in their way.

250
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,643
Most likely, you aren't
on their assassination list.

251
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,011
[USOPP]
Oh, okay.

252
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,279
[VIVI]
Now that I think about it...

253
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,216
I bet that booby‐trapped alcohol
was meant to get us instead.

254
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,117
[gasps]

255
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,787
Huh? What did you
say about alcohol?

256
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,722
Broggy gave Dorry
some of your alcohol

257
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,290
that must have
been tampered with.

258
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,660
Because, when Dorry drank
the barrels, they exploded.

259
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,196
No way!

260
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,965
They actually exploded
inside the guy?!

261
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,567
Wait! He was injured that badly,

262
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,302
and he still ran
off to go fight?

263
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,804
[LUFFY]
I tried to stop him, and that's

264
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,705
how I ended up like this.

265
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,175
[BROGGY, DORRY grunting]

266
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,810
[USOPP]
This is horrible.

267
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,645
Those two have been
fighting as hard as they can

268
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:37,349
for 100 years! And they
always ended in a draw.

Their duels are fought with
the most honor and pride

in the whole world!

276
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:52,698
Yeah.

277
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:53,899
There's no way
they can settle it

278
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,235
once and for all like this!

00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,892
Well, he keeps fighting.

283
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,361
He certainly is stubborn...

Yes. Well...

287
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,301
I should lend some assistance.

00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,439
[DORRY] I now know that
this was a judgment.

297
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,876
A judgment from Elbaf...
The god of war.

298
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,113
I didn't have the god's
protection... and that is all.

I think I heard something.

animal yelping helplessly

307
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,016

Do I see tears of joy?

I doubt that happiness
will last long.

323
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,953
But... For now, I offer
you my congratulations.

324
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,755
Did you say "happiness"?

325
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,991
You... know nothing.

326
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,793
Who are you, little man?

00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,561
I am Mr. 3.

328
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,596
That's a codename, of
course, which is necessary

329
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,066
in my line of work.
I am an artist of sorts.

330
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,567
And this is my assistant.

331
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,003
All the best artists
require assistants, you see.

332
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,739
Her name is Miss Golden Week.

333
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,574
I tell you all this
because I've already

00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,910
caught you in one
of my art works.

335
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,647

you done to me?!

I don't know what
we're dealing with here,

but I'm gonna take
care of them myself!

341
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,437
I'll come, too, Usopp.

342
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,371
Good.

343
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,040
Having you along with me
will be reassuring.
