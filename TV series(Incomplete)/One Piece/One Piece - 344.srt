1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:31,414
<i>Make some waves...</i>

38
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,366
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

39
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,827
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

40
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,498
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

41
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:50,503
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

42
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,424
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

43
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,802
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

44
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,221
Now you just have to find it!

45
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,683
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

46
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,644
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

47
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,522
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

48
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,235
[panting heavily]

49
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,696
I saw you fight those zombies.

50
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:20,867
All of you have such
unbelievable strength!

51
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,913
There's an evil man
who must be brought down!

52
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:28,291
If you'd help me get my shadow
back, I'd be ever so grateful!

53
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,292
Your shadow?

54
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,543
Hold on.

55
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,004
Did we just find another guy
who had his shadow taken away?

56
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,340
He's just like Brook!

57
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,674
Well damn. That sucks.

58
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,385
So who did that to you?
Is he here?

59
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,803
Somewhere on this island?

60
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,849
His name is Moria.
And he's terrifying.

61
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,436
Moria? You don't mean--

62
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,814
[ROBIN] Gecko Moria,
by any chance?

63
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,777
[SPOIL] That's right.
Yes. That's him.

64
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,737
[LUFFY] Robin,
do you know this guy?

65
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,905
[ROBIN ] Yes.

66
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,492
Gecko Moria is one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea.

67
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,453
Gaaah!

68
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,589
You fools!

69
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,592
He found us!

70
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,761
[HOGBACK] What did you see?

71
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,473
Didn't I tell you never to
peek into my research room?

72
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,725
We didn't see anything!

73
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,978
Right! Nothing! We swear!

74
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,313
I didn't see anything at all!

75
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,606
Really?

76
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,148
Really!

77
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,441
It's the honest truth!

78
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,945
We certainly didn't see that,
uh, that zombie you were making!

79
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,363
Dumbass!

80
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,951
Alright, fine then.

81
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:45,952
Huh?

82
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,704
[HOGBACK] I'm sure
you've figured out some of

83
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:51,291
my secrets by now,
but you're too late.

84
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,625
Woe unto those foolish enough

85
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,752
to wander this
island after dark.

86
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,423
No intruder shall
survive the Night Hunt!

87
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,425
[growls]

88
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,094
Now! Zombie Soldiers!

89
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,638
The Zombie Generals
will lead the attack.

90
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,932
Let's finish off those pirates!

91
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,643
[cheering]

92
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,895
[PERONA] Are the preparations
complete, my zombies?

93
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,315
[cheering]

94
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:21,446
[MORIA] In this dark realm,
one of ghosts and ghouls.

95
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,657
This place we
call Thriller Bark.

96
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,576
They are going to
see nothing short of

97
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,662
the nightmare
to end all nightmares!

98
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:37,045
Well, here we go.
To the Ghost Mansion!

99
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,008
[LUFFY] "Feast of
the Zombie Song!

100
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,761
The Night Hunt's Bell
is the Sound of Darkness!"

101
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:08,076
[groaning]

102
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,722
What was that nonsense about
studying zombies, Hogback?

103
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,723
There's no hiding it now.

104
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,725
We know you're the one
making all the creatures

105
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,894
on this island, so out
with the truth already!

106
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,897
Whoa, easy there,
Nami! Don't piss him off!

107
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,901
Fasfasfasfasfasf!

108
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,778
Your accusations
are meaningless,

109
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,196
whether they're true or not.

110
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,824
But out of curiosity,
what's your proof?

111
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,746
[NAMI] We read your
assistant's obituary!

112
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:58,000
Victoria Cindry,
you died ten years ago!

113
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,463
You cretins! How the
hell did you know that?

114
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,882
Answer me!

115
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,720
So not only did you
sneak into my secret lab,

116
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,681
but that room as well.

117
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,183
My dear Cindry.
Samurai Ryuma.

118
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:18,438
Throw them into the world
of darkness, never to return!

119
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,609
Wait! Let's talk this over!

120
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,779
Sorry Doctor, but I'm afraid
it's too late for that now.

121
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,240
The Night Hunt has
already begun, you see!

122
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,118
[clacking footsteps]

123
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,792
[RYUMA] Done with your
little tour of the lab?

124
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,462
Do you need me to show you out?

125
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,143
[RYUMA]
Nyohohohoho!

126
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,064
Oh my. Upon
closer inspection,

127
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,775
you're quite the lovely
young lady, aren't you?

128
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,819
Beautiful!

129
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,113
Oh no. Not at all.

130
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,700
You know, I only have
eyes for girls like you.

131
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,703
Or I would, if I had any
eyes in the first place.

132
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,872
Nyohohohoho!

133
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,998
That said, perhaps you

134
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,541
would like to show
me your panties?

135
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,834
Yeah right!

136
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,587
Eh? I know that line.

137
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,882
I'm all eyes
for ladies like you.

138
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,010
Or I would be if
skeletons had any eyes.

139
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,678
Yohohoho!

140
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,723
Could you, perhaps,
show me your panties?

141
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,683
[NAMI] Yeah, right!

142
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,686
[NAMI thinking] This can't
just be a coincidence!

143
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,983
[HOGBACK]
Fasfasfasfasfas!

144
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,944
This fellow is of
a much better stock

145
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,863
than the zombies you've
encountered thus far.

146
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,533
He is one of my
"Zombie Generals."

147
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,284
His body is quite special.

148
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,913
It hearkens from the country
of Wano in the New World.

149
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,125
[HOGBACK] They call his
sort a "samurai" and this one,

150
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,795
supposedly slayed
a flying dragon.

151
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,214
At least, according
to the legend.

152
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,302
Stay back! Stay back!

153
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,054
Please, don't hurt me!

154
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,016
[HOGBACK]
Fasfasfasfas!

155
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,561
There's nowhere to run!

156
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,917
[RYUMA] Cindry,
if you would, my dear,

157
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,335
please open that door for me.

158
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:50,006
And if you have a moment,
I'd like a sandwich as well.

159
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,132
Wait. What happened?

160
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,175
I thought he was
going to cut us.

161
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,635
Yeah, so did I.

162
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,095
He looked really
scary just then.

163
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,763
Whatever, you guys! Come on!

164
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,640
Let's get out of here
while we still can!

165
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,017
Look, the door is wide open!

166
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,268
Good point.

167
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,352
[CHOPPER] Uh, right!

168
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,938
Run!

169
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,030
Splendid!

170
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,740
Fasfasfasfasfas!

171
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,742
They say when a
true master cuts you,

172
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,661
you can just walk away,
humming and smiling.

173
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,956
It's not until later that you
realize you've been struck down.

174
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:31,297
[RYUMA] Three-Verse Humming:
Arrow Notch Slash!

175
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:41,766
Fasfasfasfasfas!

176
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,297
[LUFFY] Hello?
Nobody's there. I'm going in.

177
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,424
[SANJI] Hey! Give 'em a minute!

Eh. No biggie. It's Sanji.

Maybe.

But I'm worried
about the other three.

265

If the zombies were able
to kidnap Sanji so easily,

266

I'm sure they're in a
lot of trouble right now.

You're not so strong.

a dent in our numbers!

your key fighters!

stick together from now on.

I suppose that we
could threaten him,

but even if we did, I doubt he
would tell us where they are.

Fine.

281
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,052
We'll just drag him with us
and use him as a guide.

then challenge our master.

[CHOPPER] Are you kidding?

351
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:24,986
I'm a reindeer!

352
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,696
I think animals should run free!

353
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,614
[NAMI] Oh, me too.

354
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,116
But what if those
animals were zombies

355
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,784
and they were
trying to kill you?

356
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,993
[CHOPPER] Oh yeah. Lock 'em up.

357
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:35,372
[BOTH] Would anybody like
to start an Animal Zombie Zoo?

358
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,957
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

359
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,918
"A Bunch of Animals?
Perona's Wonder Garden!"

360
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,003
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
