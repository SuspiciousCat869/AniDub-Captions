172
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:51,190
Please don't kill me!

173
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,626
[CHOO] Choo. Enough of
your cowardly lies!

174
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,330
Even if you don't know Zoro,
you still stood against Arlong.

175
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,198
You die either way.

176
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,535
[USOPP] Okay! No more lies!
Zoro and I are like brothers!

177
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,204
Partners for life! If you
so much as lay one of your

178
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,507
creepy webbed fingers on me,
he'll show up and kill you all!

179
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:13,179
[ARLONG] Is that right? So, if I
kill you, Zoro will show up?

180
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,215
[USOPP whines]

181
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,317
[USOPP] No, no! That's not
what I was trying to say!

182
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,219
I was trying to say
the exact opposite.

183
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,389
Killing me is bad! If you keep
me alive, Zoro will show up!

184
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,224
See?!

185
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,560
[KUROOBI] What I want
to know is how...

186
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,327
[ARLONG]
Hm?

187
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,229
[KUROOBI]
How did he escape?

188
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,297
[ARLONG]
What do you mean?

189
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,233
[KUROOBI] What I mean is,
someone let him escape.

190
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,501
[ARLONG growls]

191
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:39,238
I think that somebody
has betrayed us.

192
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,574
Perhaps it was Nami
who let him in.

193
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,076
So that bastard
could take your head.

194
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,244
[ARLONG grunts]

195
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,379
[FISHMAN E]
Now that you mention it,

196
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,581
she has been acting
strange lately.

197
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,749
[FISHMAN F]
Yeah.

198
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,584
She even helped Zoro when
he jumped into the water.

199
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,319
[FISHMAN K] Don't tell me
she was working with Zoro

200
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,420
from the start!

201
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,423
[FISHMAN O]
And tricked us all!

202
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,760
[KUROOBI] Don't forget.
Her chief skill is deception.

203
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,662
[NAMI]
Enough of this!

204
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,063
[FISHMAN]
Huh?

205
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,671
You should be ashamed.
This is pure conjecture!

206
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:17,176
Nami...?

207
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,764
[footsteps]

208
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:43,102
[NAMI] How dare you.
You would call me a traitor?

209
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,370
[KUROOBI grunts]

210
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:48,274
[NAMI] I swore I was a member
of this group eight years ago.

211
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,377
My loyalty... is shown
with this tattoo.

212
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:58,417
I'm sorry, Nami. It's natural
for you to be upset.

213
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,985
But you should know,

214
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,321
I don't suspect you of
anything treacherous, Nami.

215
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,923
I trust you.

216
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,295
[ARLONG] After all, we've known
each other for eight years.

217
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,464
We're just... a little
on edge right now.

218
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,433
That's all. Surely you
can understand that.

219
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,136
We need to focus on Zoro and
his gang of bounty hunters.

220
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,271
[gasps]

221
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,241
Hey! Nami! Say something!

222
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,443
Please! Nami!

223
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:30,316
[NAMI grunts] He just had
to go and do that...

224
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,451
[ARLONG chuckles]

225
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,487
[KUROOBI]
What's wrong Nami?

226
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,493
You're pale... You feelin okay?

227
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,995
As for long‐nose here...

228
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:43,963
[USOPP gasps]

229
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,832
[KUROOBI]
Not even you can save him now.

230
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:47,933
[USOPP whimpers]

231
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,936
No... Not when he defied Arlong.

232
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,940
How long?! How long will
I be suspected of betrayal?!

233
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,610
[KUROOBI] You're too
clever for your own good.

234
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,479
[NAMI] I'll have the amount
Arlong and I agreed to soon.

235
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,449
It doesn't make any sense
for me to betray you now!

236
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,284
The amount they agreed to?

237
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:05,985
[KUROOBI]
I know.

238
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,987
[USOPP gasps]

239
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,122
[KUROOBI] Eight years ago
you agreed to purchase

240
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:14,527
Cocoyashi Village for
100 million berries. Heh.

241
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,363
But I just can't figure it out.

242
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,865
You love nothing.
Except money.

243
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,635
You betrayed your family
and your village for it.

244
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,871
So... Why do you care
for this village now?

245
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,041
This puny little heap of houses.

246
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,043
I thought long
and hard about it.

247
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:34,046
Then I found this...
in your room.

248
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,583
[ARLONG]
Huh?

249
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,053
It, can't be... That's my!

250
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,054
[gasps]

251
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,591
What?! What'you mean?
You say he was captured.

252
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,859
Yeah!

253
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,161
They took him back to Arlong
Park just a little while ago!

254
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,364
That courageous young man stood
up to Arlong and those fishmen.

255
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,600
He's probably dead by now!

256
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,902
[VILLAGER A gasps]

257
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,572
This is bad.
They won't be forgiving.

258
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,441
He got caught right
after my little visit.

259
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,210
[ZORO grunts]

260
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,412
[ZORO]
Usopp! Hold on!

261
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,257
[KUROOBI] This looks
suspiciously like a

262
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:23,429
treasure map. And it seems to be
pointing to Cocoyashi Village.

263
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,935
[NAMI] I can't believe you have
the nerve to go through my

264
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,270
personal belongings!

265
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,272
That's my map and it has
nothing to do with you!

266
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:37,309
[KUROOBI] So angry... Is there
something on your mind?

267
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,112
[HATCHAN gasps]

268
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,115
[HATCHAN]
What is this?!

269
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,285
Why are all these guys dead?
What happened?

270
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,455
[ARLONG]
The pirate hunter Zoro did it!

271
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,424
Why weren't you
here Hatchi? Huh?

272
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,293
This could've been prevented,
had you been here!

273
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,395
[HATCHAN gasps]
Of course it could've!

274
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,298
Had I only been here!

275
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,133
It's unforgivable!

276
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,635
We get it. You weren't here.

277
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,005
So you don't know where
he is, is that right?

278
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,975
[HATCHAN growls]
Well, let me think about it...

279
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,578
I saw one guy.
Yeah that's right...

280
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:16,148
He was a slightly
suspicious swordsman type.

281
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,520
[HATCHAN gasps]
That's him!

282
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,989
[FISHMAN gasps]

283
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,691
[KUROOBI]
You did see him, you idiot!

284
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,326
[CHOO]
So where did he go?!

285
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,361
[HATCHAN] He told me he
wanted to see Arlong,

286
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,631
so I gave him a ride
to Cocoyashi Village.

287
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,104
Excellent... That means we
don't have any need to hurry.

288
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,541
He's going to come
straight to me.

289
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,709
Sorry Arlong,

290
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,111
but if I had known you were
going to be back so soon,

291
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,513
I would have kept
him here for you.

292
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,015
But he said he was a guest and
I thought I should get him

293
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,518
to the village as
fast as I could.

294
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,286
[USOPP]
Zoro huh?

295
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,656
Which means if I can buy
just a little more time...

296
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,528
[gasps]

297
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,530
[NAMI] Why do you keep
getting in the way?!

298
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:10,369
Everything's so close to
working out! So close!

299
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,544
[USOPP groans]

300
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,550
[USOPP grunts] Damn you Nami!
You want a fight don't ya?

301
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,518
[NAMI]
This is your fault Usopp.

302
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,687
You're the one
getting in the way.

303
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,690
This is what you get
for messing with Arlong.

304
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,060
[USOPP] Nami, you've really
disappointed me.

305
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,262
Even after you stole
our ship and ran off,

306
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,566
Luffy had complete faith in you.
He trusts you completely,

307
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,735
and you haven't even
shown an ounce of guilt!

308
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,237
How can you betray
someone like that?!

309
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,072
Are you really that
cold‐hearted?

310
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,174
[NAMI]
The only thing I trust is money.

311
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,510
Those dumb enough to
be fooled, deserve it.

312
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,445
[USOPP]
How can you say that?!

313
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,684
You idiots... It was
going according to plan.

314
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,688
[NAMI] I'm not about to
let you and your friends

315
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,791
ruin eight long
years of hard work.

316
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,128
So long, Usopp.
It's just business.

317
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,696
You understand.

318
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,766
[ARLONG]
Heh. Well I'll be damned.

319
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,635
Looks like you became a
pirate while you were gone.

320
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,270
So long...?

321
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,705
[laughs]

322
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,641
What, like you're
gonna kill me?!

323
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:27,713
That's right... I wouldn't
underestimate me.

324
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,249
[USOPP]
Aww crap...

325
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:33,285
If I stay here,
I'm a dead man.

326
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,820
Special attack...!

327
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,793
[USOPP]
...Smoke Star!

328
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:45,831
[FISHMEN cough]

329
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,667
[USOPP]
Now's my chance!

330
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,637
[USOPP gasps]

331
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,139
[NAMI] This is just like
something you'd think up.

332
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,241
[USOPP]
Nami!

333
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,111
[USOPP gasps]
Don't do this...

334
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,820
[NAMI]
It's for my business.

335
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,491
[ARLONG chuckles]

336
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,492
[USOPP gasps]

337
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,494
[NAMI]
This was my only choice.

338
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,629
[USOPP]
Nami, how could you...?

339
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,332
[USOPP gasps]

340
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,434

Now go and die.

[FISHMEN cheer]

342
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,684
I can't believe it!
Big, Sis Nami...

343
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:42,654
...killed Big Bro Usopp!

344
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:48,193
Your wish came true...
You died at sea.

345
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,729
[KUROOBI] Nami. I'm sorry
for doubting you.

346
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,532
Without question...
You're our friend.

347
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,667
Friend huh?

348
00:18:55,701 --> 00:19:00,405
There's only one reason
I joined this group.

349
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,509
And that's to buy Cocoyashi
Village from you!

350
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,679
Ya got that? Just business.
Not friends.

351
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,483
Keep your end of the deal and
I'll have those berries soon.

352
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,918
Yes, of course!

353
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,387
I'd rather cut my
stomach open and die

354
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,723
then break a promise
concerning money.

355
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,659
That's the kind of man I am.

356
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,695
[NAMI] Glad to hear it, Arlong.
You know the score.

357
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,733
[KUROOBI]
She gives me the creeps.

358

[ARLONG laughs]

359
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,504

woman she's become!

He's dead... She killed him!

[LUFFY]
Hey! Keep up the pace, cow!

366
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,592
I feel sorry for it.

367
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,361
Sanji's kicks must've
really taken their toll!

368
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,730
[LUFFY] Not that way!
Go to your other left!

369
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,732

It's strange. I made it...
all this way.

373
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,895
I've endured eight whole
years since that day.

374
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:34,666
[ARLONG] All right. As of today,
this will be your room.

375
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,436
[ARLONG]
Your desk... Your pens...

376
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,906
Everything you'll
need is in here.

377
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,676
[NAMI grunts]
Eight years I persevered.

378
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,012
I had no choice
but to endure it.

Almost?!

We are flying, you moron!

Whadya mean? We're here
to pick up Nami. Duh.

397
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,820
How come you haven't
found her yet?

398
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,923
Oh yeah! And what about
Usopp and Johnny?

399
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:09,594

C'mon we gotta hurry!

been caught by Arlong!
