legends anymore these days.

174
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,429
But if they'd seen your duel
with Hawkeye like I did,

175
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:46,032
they'd be yapping about it
'til the end of time.

176
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,901
[WHITEBEARD] Still, when you
came back from East Blue

177
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,103
missing an arm,

178
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,572
you better believe
the rumors were flying.

179
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,040
I was pretty curious myself.

180
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,310
[WHITEBEARD] Now I can
ask you face to face.

181
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:59,412
What enemy did you
give that left arm to?

182
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,285
This, huh?

183
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,122
I wouldn't take you
with me, anyway.

184
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,291
You'll never
make it as a pirate.

185
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,326
No!

186
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,794
[LUFFY]
I will make it as a pirate!

187
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,498
Someday, I'm gonna gather
a crew even better than yours,

188
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,300
and I'm gonna find the
greatest treasure in the world,

189
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,369
and then I'll be
King of the Pirates!

190
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,904
I'll show you!

191
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:28,441
Let's just say I made
a bet on a new era.

192
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,714
If you have no regrets,
then it's fine.

193
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,282
[SHANKS] You know, Whitebeard...

194
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,886
I've fought countless battles,

195
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,889
and I've received
countless scars as well.

196
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,658
But the only one
that's aching right now

197
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:48,028
is this one right here.

198
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,783
[SHANKS] I didn't get this
scar from an adventure,

199
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:10,951
or in my fight with Hawkeye.

200
00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:16,156
[SHANKS] No. This one came from
someone who was on your crew.

201
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,592
Blackbeard. Teach.

202
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,429
[SHANKS] And this didn't happen

203
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,231
because I was being
careless, either.

204
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:27,467
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

205
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,436
Don't deny it.

206
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,239
[SHANKS] He laid low
and waited for his chance.

207
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,442
He never became a squad leader.

208
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:37,210
He never tried to
make a name for himself.

209
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:42,849
All he did was hide himself
behind your giant shadow.

210
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,954
And once he had enough power,
he finally made his move.

211
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,590
A man like that
will never be satisfied.

212
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,559
He'll use all of his will
in order to reach the top.

213
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:55,328
And that means he'll
come after you as well!

214
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,536
[WHITEBEARD] Why don't you
get to the point, already?

215
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,005
What do you want from me?

216
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:07,607
I want you to stop Ace.

217
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,078
[SHANKS] He's young,

218
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,813
and he's more than
good enough to be the leader

219
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,415
of the Second Division.

220
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:17,250
Don't get me wrong,
I know how strong he is.

221
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:29,630
Still, no matter how
much you trust him,

222
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,631
I think this is a big mistake.

223
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:32,532
Now is simply not the time

224
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,702
for those two
to go head-to-head.

225
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:39,139
I want you to keep your
distance from Blackbeard.

226
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:41,474
That's what I came
here to ask of you.

227
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:50,784
[laughing]

228
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,386
He's laughing. What's going on?

229
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,254
[WHITEBEARD]
You snot-nosed brat.

230
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,290
Do you know what you're asking?

231
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,159
[WHITEBEARD] Teach murdered
one of my crewmates,

232
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,526
one of his crewmates.

233
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,196
That's the one rule that can
never be broken.

234
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:05,132
Every pirate in
the world knows that.

235
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,666
[WHITEBEARD]
When a pirate joins my crew,

236
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,204
no matter how stupid they are,
they become like a son to me.

237
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:14,241
So what am I to say to the
soul of my murdered child?

238
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:17,411
You can't live in this world
without a code of conduct!

239
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:20,147
If Teach doesn't
realize that on his own,

240
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,618
then it's my responsibility
to drill it into his thick head!

241
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,924
[WHITEBEARD]
You're a hundred years too young

242
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:31,959
to boss me around, boy.

243
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,394
Have I made myself
perfectly clear?

244
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,243
Then this era
will spiral into chaos,

245
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,579
and no one will
be able to stop it.

246
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,816
Is that supposed
to frighten me, boy?

247
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,284
I...

248
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,652
...am...

249
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,087
...Whitebeard!

250
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:07,327
[thunder]

251
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,065
Damn it!
What's going on?

252
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,666
Maybe we should go help him.

253
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,034
Nah, wait it out.

254
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:17,138
Red Hair ain't stupid enough
to start a fight here.

255
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:18,505
True, but either way,

256
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,408
it looks like their
talk has come to an end.

257
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,277
Look at the sky.

258
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,813
[JOZU] The clouds--
No, the heavens themselves

259
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,414
have been divided!

260
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,654
[ALL groaning]

261
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:35,756
Forget it!

262
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,557
Let me take care of this!

263
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,262
[FRANKY FAMILY BUBBLEMAN]
Hey, guys!

264
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:46,099
Look! It's today's newspaper!

265
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,134
[FRANKY FAMILY BUBBLEMAN]
They have a big report

266
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,401
on Enies Lobby.

267
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,771
Come on!
Don't leave us hanging!

268
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:52,606
Quick! Tell us what it says!

269
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,543
That article is gonna
decide all our fates!

270
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,011
[FRANKY FAMILY BUBBLEMAN]
Well, about that...

271
00:17:57,044 --> 00:17:59,113
Yeah? Go on!

272
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:00,113
[FRANKY FAMILY BUBBLEMAN]
There's nothing much

273
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,315
to say, really.

274
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,617
It doesn't mention us at all.

275
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,886
[ZAMBAI yelling]

276
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,188
I was afraid of this!

277
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:11,191
We'll have to pack our stuff
and leave Water 7!

278
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,827
[ZAMBAI] Wait,
it doesn't mention us?

279
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,228
--[ALL cheering]
--[ZAMBAI] Really?

280
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,231
[FRANKY FAMILY BEARDFACE]
Not a single word?

281
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,232
[FRANKY FAMILY BUBBLEMAN] Nope!

282
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,666
[ZAMBAI] We're saved!

283
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,702
I thought I was gonna have
to live the rest of my life

284
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:23,370
as a fugitive!

285
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:26,607
[ZORO] I don't get it.

286
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,610
The Franky Family
really wrecked up the place.

287
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:30,777
[SANJI] Maybe your Grandpa?

288
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:32,980
Like he pulled some strings
and told the government

289
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:35,482
that they were just
innocent bystanders?

290
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:40,587
Nah. That's too
complicated for him.

291
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,789
--Yeah. What Luffy said.
--Yeah. What Luffy said.

292
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,096
[ROBIN] It's must
be Aokiji's doing.

293
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,464
What a strange man.

294
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,899
[SANJI] At any rate,
that's good for them.

295
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,835
Obviously we're criminals,

296
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:57,304
but I would hate to see anyone
get wrapped up in this mess

297
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:59,040
and have their
whole lives ruined.

298
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:00,341
[ZORO] Well, good thing
you feel that way,

299
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:02,776
'cause they had
plenty to say about us.

300
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,679
[ZORO] "A Declaration of War
on the World Government".

301
00:19:05,713 --> 00:19:08,382
They even blame us for
burning down the island.

302
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,684
I guarantee our bounties
are gonna go through the roof

303
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:11,852
after this one.

304
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,254
[CHOPPER]
Oh!

305
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:15,922
Oh my gosh, does that
mean I'll finally get a bounty?

306
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:18,592
[SANJI] Maybe.
You'll probably get something.

307
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,361
But mine's gonna be
the big one this time.

308
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,336
"A bright star appears", right?

309
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,172
What're you excited about?!

310
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:33,240
This is terrible news!

311
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,685
[KIWI] Hey, bro,
Iceberg's here to see you.

312
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:45,919
[MOZU] Right over there.

313
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,587
[ICEBERG]
So you're really doing it.

314
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:49,089
--[YOKOZUNA] Gero!
--[FRANKY] So what?

315
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,690
[FRANKY]
You wanna fight about it?

316
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,127
[ICEBERG] Well, no.

317
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,162
But if you'd like,
I could help you out.

318
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,000
[FRANKY] Tch. Yeah, right.

319
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,503
You're probably just here
to mess with my head.

320
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,170
[ICEBERG] You've been
dismantling so long,

321
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,574
I'm afraid your
skills have dulled.

322
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:08,175
Show me your blueprints.

323
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,844
[PAULIE] A reunion
for Tom's Workers, huh?

324
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,246
[ICEBERG] Hm?

325
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,447
I hope you old pros have
room for a couple of rookies.

326
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:15,882
[cheering]

327
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,752
Galley-La Company

328
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:20,420
Let's build the
Straw Hats a ship!

329
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:22,223
They're probably itching
to get off this island,

330
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:24,324
so we figured you
could use a little help.

331
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:28,261
Well, I thought you
were repairing the city.

332
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,564
We were, but when we heard
you were building a new ship

333
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:33,333
for the Straw Hats,
everyone packed up their stuff

334
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,703
and ran here
as fast as they could.

335
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,137

336
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,273
Of course I'm happy to have you!

00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:41,641
They really touched my heart!

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,061
Franky's building us a ship

345
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:02,863
and we don't even
have to pay for it?

346
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:03,964
Oh, right.

347
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:05,299
You were asleep
when he said that.

348
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:08,168
Awesome, I guess Franky's
not a jerk after all!

349
00:21:08,202 --> 00:21:09,570
Franky's a nice guy!

350
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:10,804
--I thought he was a bad guy!
--I can't wait to see

351
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:11,805
how it turns out!

352
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:12,940
[NAMI] Good.

353
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:13,907
Now we can use
the rest of our money

354
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,742
to buy supplies for the voyage.

355
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,678
[LUFFY] Do you think the ship's
gonna be big or super big?

356
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,981
[ZORO] I hope this one's
equipped with a weight room.

357
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:23,250
[LUFFY] As long as it
has cannons, I'm happy.

358
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,751
The bigger the better.

359
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,359
[LUFFY] Wow, that's some dance.

360
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,794
[CHOPPER] Huh...
So that's what it is.

361
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:45,005
What happened to
our 100 million Berries?

362
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:47,074
Oh, that?
I already spent it all.

363
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:50,176
We needed to buy lots of
meat and booze for the party.

364
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:54,882
Spent it?

365
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:57,084
You spent all of my money?!

366
00:21:57,117 --> 00:21:58,652
[LUFFY] Well, everyone
was really hungry...

367
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:00,654
[frustrated scream]

368
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:03,290
How could you
spend so much on food?

369
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,892
There's hardly anything left!

370
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:05,992
Of course there's isn't!

371
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:07,360
The whole town
was partying with us

372
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:10,130
and they didn't go home
until morning, remember?

373
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,731
Sure was fun, huh?

374
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,701
[laughing]

375
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:17,571
[loud banging noises]

376
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:21,742
Since the ship's
free, we'll be fine!

377
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,443
So no worries, right?

378
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:26,180
[NAMI] I just wanted nice
furniture for the ship!

379
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:27,748
Is that so wrong?

380
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:30,417
[ROBIN] We can still
check out the resale shops.

381
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:34,321
Hey, can I have some of
that money to go play with?

382
00:22:34,355 --> 00:22:37,224
I'd sooner take
it to the grave!

383
00:22:37,258 --> 00:22:39,459
Your allowance is revoked!

384
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:41,628
[LUFFY] Yes, ma'am!

385
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,427
[LUFFY] This Water-Water
candy is so good,

386
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:16,229
I'm never gonna
eat anything else!

387
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,098
[CHOPPER] I heard it even
helps you when you're sick!

388
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,300
Oh, but if you eat that much,

389
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,702
you'll probably still
get a stomachache.

390
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:23,037
[ABI] Um, Straw Hat?

391
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,371
[LUFFY, CHOPPER]
Hm?

392
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,240
[ABI] You have to help
me find my friend, please!

393
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:28,142
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

394
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:30,343
A Girl in Search of Her Yagara!

395
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:32,980
Great Search
in the City of Water!

396
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:35,649
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
