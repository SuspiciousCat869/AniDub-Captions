1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:38,158
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,061
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

39
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,331
and everything else
the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:50,336
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,505
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

42
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,573
You can have it!

43
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:57,177
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

44
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,913
Now you just have to find it!

45
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,349
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

46
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,352
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

47
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,589
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

48
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,194
[NARRATOR] While making
their way to the New World,

49
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,130
the Straw Hat crew were
confronted by the Accino family,

50
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,698
a clan of bounty hunters.

51
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,234
[FRANKY]
Coup de...

52
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,269
[FRANKY]
...Burst!

53
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,542
[NARRATOR] The Sunny managed
to escape the Accino family

54
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,445
and free itself from the Frozen
Highway for a brief while.

55
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,215
But then the very soul
of the ship, the pirate flag,

56
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,950
was stolen from them.

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,553
[USOPP] Shimmering
behind a pirate fla--fla--

58
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,388
What the hell?

59
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,123
[NAMI] Our flag! It's gone!

60
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,962
[NAMI] Huh? What's that?

61
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,998
[NARRATOR]
The seemingly sentient icebergs

62
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,235
turned out to be controlled
by the strange Domo Penguins.

63
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,338
[USOPP yelling]

64
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,281
He's too far!

65
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,250
[NARRATOR] And with the
Straw Hat crew split up

66
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,585
and effectively weakened,
the Accino family

67
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,755
made their move to
pick them off one by one.

68
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,323
[LIL laughing]

69
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,125
[LIL] Will you play with me?

70
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,493
It'll be fun.

71
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,496
[BRINDO] Oh, how rude of me.

72
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,299
I am the second son
of the Accino family.

73
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,700
The name's Brindo.

74
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,136
[BRINDO]
Ohohohoho!

75
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,339
[BRINDO]
Ohoho! Ohoho! Ohohohoho!

76
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,212
[LUFFY] The Straw Hat's
Hard Battles!

77
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,215
A Pirate Soul Risking
it All for the Flag!

78
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,652
[LUFFY]
What the heck's Lovely Land?

79
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:46,486
Lovely?

80
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,354
[BRINDO] Ohohohoho!

81
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,455
What is it?

82
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,457
Well, it's your flag's new home.

83
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,161
The fortress stronghold
of the proud Accino family.

84
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,796
[BRINDO] A place so splendid...

85
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,531
...that even our
prisoners are turned over

86
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,301
to the marines with
a smile on their face!

87
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,302
Yes!

88
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,637
The great Lovely Land!

89
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,676
I don't care
about your house!

90
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,312
But I haven't gotten
to the interesting part--

91
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,181
[LUFFY] Quit running!

92
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,585
[CHOPPER] Luffy!

93
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,388
Well...

94
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,224
You caught me off-guard
earlier, but trust me.

95
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,660
It won't happen a second time.

96
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,195
Hey, raccoon dog!

97
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,496
I'm a reindeer!

98
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,565
[BRINDO] Your captain's
quite the fool, huh?

99
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,269
I mean, what kind of pirate
leader lets his flag get stolen?

100
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,104
[BRINDO]
And the rest of you scum?

101
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,506
You have a world
of hurt coming to you.

102
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,575
I'm going to personally
escort you to hell

103
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,378
for covering up that
cowardly captain of yours.

104
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,348
All right.

105
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,582
I see you won't listen.

106
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,683
A shame, really.

107
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,852
You'll never know what
happened to your flag now.

108
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,254
Gum-Gum Gatling!

109
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:57,924
[BRINDO] Damn.

110
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,692
I thought I could wear him out,

111
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,061
but this guy
has energy to spare!

112
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,232
[BRINDO] He seems
to be speeding up, too!

113
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,634
I can't keep dodging
like this forever!

114
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,111
Your ship is really cute.

115
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,746
Does it have a name?

116
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,382
Of course.
It's the Thousand Sunny.

117
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,716
Thousand Sunny?

118
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,151
[giggles]

119
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,819
And you? What's your name?

120
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,287
Oh, my name?

121
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,658
My name's Robin. Nico Robin.

122
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,593
Robin, huh?

123
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,896
[ROBIN] Yes.
I saw you earlier, didn't I?

124
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:37,897
[LIL] You noticed me?

125
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,998
Of course I did.

126
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,501
You surprised me the way
you appeared all of a sudden

127
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,769
out of nowhere.

128
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,671
So, Lil.

129
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,807
Do you happen to know
any of this ship's crew?

130
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,742
Thousand Sunny's crew?

131
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,144
I don't think so.

132
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,278
I see.

133
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,413
--Then perhaps you could
--But I do know where the crew's

134
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,481
--tell me a little something--
--flag is being hidden.

135
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,316
[gasps]

136
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,851
[LIL]
You're looking for it, right?

137
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,120
Mm-hmm, So where is it?

138
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,425
[ROBIN]
Won't you please tell me?

139
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,163
Maybe. If you...

140
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:10,930
If I...?

141
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,765
[LIL] If you play with me!

142
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,768
Play a game with me
and then I'll tell you.

143
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,603
All right. I'll play.

144
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,606
[LIL] Really? Awesome!

145
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,677
Y'see, my big sister
won't play with me lately.

146
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,213
She's busy playing with Salchow,

147
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,616
so she ignores me
to be with that jerk.

148
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,786
[laughing]

149
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,788
Yes! Beautiful!

150
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,392
Salchow! Look at us!

151
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,394
Our form is a work of art!

152
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,463
[USOPP] What's goin' on
with these two weirdos?

153
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,531
They're not even
bothering to attack.

154
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,400
All they do is
spin, spin, spin,

155
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,735
spin, spin, spin,
spin around us!

156
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,706
[SALCHOW] Jump and kick!

157
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,642
[SALCHOW]
Arbell...

158
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,478
...this rink today...

159
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,979
The surface is...

160
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,814
...quite exceptional!

161
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,583
Dammit!

162
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,650
--[ARBELL] Jump and kick!

163
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,319
--[USOPP] Ooh! The pain!
--[ARBELL] Jump and kick!

164
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,987
[ARBELL] You're right,
Salchow, darling!

165
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,522
Skating on this ice...

166
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,423
We're flawless!

167
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,591
Doesn't look like
they're planning on

168
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,426
letting us out of here.

169
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,660
Hey, Sanji.

170
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,328
Huh?

171
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,229
We're gonna be in trouble

172
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,431
if we don't get back
to the Sunny, right?

173
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,499
Yeah.

174
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,666
Then why aren't
you doing anything

175
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,934
to stop these two?

176
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,770
[ARBELL] La-la!

177
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,606
Wahhhh!

178
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,508
[SANJI] I can't take
how sexy she is!

179
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,542
It's killing me!

180
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,244
[USOPP] I should've known.

181
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,412
It's always the same
with this guy.

182
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,947
One-track mind.

183
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,582
That's it!

184
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,351
[USOPP] Hey, you two!

185
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,020
You were the ones who
stole our flag, weren't you?

186
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,457
Tell me where you
stashed it, right now!

187
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,526
--[SALCHOW] We're just glorious!
--[USOPP] Answer me!

188
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,628
[SALCHOW, ARBELL]
La-la-la-la-la!

189
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,798
[USOPP] Geez. I'm
surrounded by lunatics.

190
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,401
I have a feeling we're
about to make Papa's day.

191
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,037
He'll be so happy once
we collect their bounties.

192
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,574
But of course, Salchow.
He'll be so proud.

193
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,544
By the way, I think we're
properly warmed up now.

194
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,711
Our bounties, huh?

195
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,547
So that's what this is?

196
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,651
[SALCHOW] Here goes!

197
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,754
[SALCHOW, ARBELL]
Love... Throw!

198
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,723
[SANJI] Arbell--

199
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,729
[SANJI] Ow.

200
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,797
[SALCHOW] Once more!

201
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,632
[SALCHOW, ARBELL]
Love... Throw!

202
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,403
A gorgeous rocket of beauty
soaring into my arms!

203
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,671
Not what I expected!

204
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,010
Damn.

205
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,416
Hitting me with a flying lady?

206
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,618
Now that is unforgivable.

207
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,290
[HOCKERA]
Hoh-ke!

208
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,660
[NAMI] He's one of
the guys from before.

209
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,861
[FRANKY] Yeah.

210
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,997
[NAMI] You're the creep who
stole our flag, aren't you?

211
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,932
Hm? Someone stole your flag?

212
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,703
Eh... Now who would do that?
Hoh ke ke ke!

213
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,604
You didn't?

214
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,540
Huh... Let's go.
This is a waste of time.

215
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,374
Okay.

216
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,610
And besides,
it's too cold out here.

217
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,345
[HOCKERA]
Whoa, whoa, hey, time out!

218
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,046
You can't just abandon a match!

219
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,181
Fine, I admit it!

220
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,618
My family's responsible
for stealing your flag, okay?

221
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,952
Then where is it?

222
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:20,886
Where?

223
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,123
Hm... Where did we put it?

224
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,392
We're not staying
unless you know.

225
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

226
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,461
Time!

227
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,863
Don't go! Not yet, at least!

228
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,699
I'll tell you where
the flag is if you stay!

229
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,001
Tell us now.

230
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,470
Now? Where was it again?

231
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,705
I'm done with this guy!

232
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,140
[HOCKERA] Time!

233
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,508
Time, time, time, time!

234
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,010
I didn't know they had missiles!

235
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,512
Shooting rockets is
not a fair fight, dammit!

236
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,981
If you fight like a real man,
then I'll tell you!

237
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,984
I'm way too cold.

238
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,486
You handle him, all right?

239
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,921
--[FRANKY] Heh heh. Sure!
--[whistle blows]

240
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,691
[HOCKERA]
Now, let the game begin!

241
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,397
If it's a missile match,
you're gonna lose!

242
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,704
[FRANKY]
As if it wasn't cold enough.

243
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,706
Maybe I should've worn pants.

244
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:14,840
[FRANKY] Come on!

245
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,677
[HOCKERA]
Hoh ke ke ke!

246
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,078
[FRANKY] Dammit.

247
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,514
It's getting harder to
see with all this smoke.

248
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,783
I thought this guy
seemed like a joke earlier.

249
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,519
But I can't hit him while
he's flailing around like that.

250
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,954
And the cold is starting
to limit my movements.

251
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,424
I'm in trouble if
I don't hit him soon.

252
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,125
[HOCKERA]
Hoh ke ke!

253
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,061
This is starting to get boring.

254
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,196
What's the point if I can't
even see your stupid face

255
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,764
when I beat you?

256
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,199
Huh?

257
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,935
Wait! You're shooting
blind, just like me!

258
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,206
You're gonna run
outta ammo at this rate!

259
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,746
[HOCKERA babbling]

260
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,715
I liked it better
when he couldn't see me.

261
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,983
Well I like it this way.

262
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,952
[HOCKERA]
Ke ke ke...

263
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,924
[ROBIN] So, which hand
do you think the coin is in?

264
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,592
Gimme a second.

265
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,328
It's this one!

266
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,633
So, Lil.

267
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,835
What?

268
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,737
[ROBIN] Where do you think
they could be hiding the flag?

269
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,671
[LIL] I don't know.

270
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,140
[ROBIN] Or you just
don't wanna tell me?

271
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,675
I don't know.

272
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,149
[laughing]

273
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,984
Okay! Stop!

274
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,252
I'll tell you where it is!

275
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,087
--Really?
--I'll tell you where it is!

276
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,922
Yes! Really, really!

277
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,795
They keep the
flags in Papa's room.

278
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:43,963
[ROBIN] Papa?

279
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,265
Yep! And he's got a pretty
big collection of 'em, too--

280
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:49,535
A whole room
full of pirate flags.

281
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,836
That many, huh?

282
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,038
[LIL] Today's our Papa's
big birthday party.

283
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,673
That's why everyone's
out trying to get him

284
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,876
the best present they can!

285
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,044
[ROBIN]
So the flag's his present?

286
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,880
No. Bad guess.

287
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,284
[LIL] These are the presents.

288
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,520
[LIL] He's got
a 300 million bounty.

289
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,889
This one has a hundred
and twenty million bounty.

290
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,625
There's a 44 million
bounty for this guy.

291
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,126
And then you.

292
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,832
There's an 80 million
bounty on your head.

293
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,300
Isn't there?

294
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:26,672
Now Gum-Gum Pistol!

295
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,742
You care that much about a flag?

296
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,910
Of course we do!

297
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,912
That flag is a symbol
of our pride!

298
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,214
It's the most
important thing we've got!

299
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,184
[LUFFY] Gum-Gum Axe!

300
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,754
Quit butting into
our conversation,

301
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,155
little raccoon dog.

302
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,158
This is a private talk
between men.

303
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:46,859
Shut up!

304
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,828
I'm more of a man than you are!

305
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,168
Really. You're just
annoying me now.

306
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,903
And what're ya
gonna do about it?

307
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:58,838
--[CHOPPER] Shut up!

308
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,272
--[BRINDO] So close!
--[CHOPPER] Shut up!

309
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,741
You almost had me that time.

310
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,678
[BRINDO] What're ya doing?

311
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,614
How're you gonna get that
flag if you defeat me here?

312
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,748
C'mon, just think about it.

313
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,618
Who's gonna take you to
Lovely Land if you knock me out?

314
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,091
Careful!

315
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:22,294
[LUFFY] Don't worry,
he'll still be able to talk.

316
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,563
I'll break everything
but his mouth.

317
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,655
[BRINDO]
I should've expected this

318
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,991
from a man
worth 300 million.

319
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,926
The only way
I can make this work

320
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,062
is if I can get them to
follow me to Lovely Land.

321
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,230
All right now.

322
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,732
Let's stay calm.

323
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,066
I'll talk--

324
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,768
Where's the flag?

325
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,939
You bastard!

326
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:07,907
Wait! Please...

327
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,276
No! Stop! Please, I give up!

328
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,677
White flag.

329
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,651
See, the truth is that I've
actually got the flag on me.

330
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,152
Here, I'll give it to you.

331
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,425
Luffy!

332
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,261
Give us back our flag!

333
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,329
Dammit!

334
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,965
[LUFFY yelling]

335
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,366
No!

336
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,103
He fell for
that one, literally.

337
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,705
If you wanna get your flag back,

338
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,041
you're going to
have to chase me down!

339
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,276
[BRINDO] And as for the
rest of you pirate scum...

340
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,345
Your time is coming, too!

341
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,052
[JIRO] Captain Puzzle!

342
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,119
[SUTTON] Puzzle!

343
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,459
[muffled screaming]

344
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,063
[CHOPPER] Luffy!

345
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,965
[SALCHOW, ARBELL]
Love Throw!

346
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,238
There's no doubt that these
are the guys who stole our flag.

347
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,807
It's obvious.

348
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,978
You've brought the wrath of
the Great Usopp upon yourselves!

349
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,479
Stupid lovebirds!

350
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,149
And now... Flame Star!

351
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,720
[ARBELL] My head's on fire!

352
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,090
Arbell, no! Oh! No, no!

353
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,825
And now you know
the consequences

354
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,327
of hurting a
pirate's pride! Ha!

355
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:43,769
[SALCHOW] Nobody sets
my honey's head on fire.

356
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,238
We were perfectly
synchronized, you fool!

357
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,743
[SALCHOW]
You long-nosed bastard!

358
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,012
[USOPP] I'm sorry!

359
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,587
Luffy! He fell into
the sea! Save him!

360
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,123
If he can't swim,
why'd he jump?

361
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,591
'Cause of the flag?

362
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,059
[CHOPPER] Luffy!

363
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,296
Come on, you can't
swim either, remember?

364
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,298
Ah! I forgot!

365
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,272
[TROFF] What? You idiots!

366
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,641
How can we head out
to sea without our flag?

367
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,143
Find it right now!

368
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,477
[ALL] Right.

369
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,319
Hey. You should put it back now.

370
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,156
The crew's gonna tear the
ship apart searching for it.

371
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,457
All right.

372
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,793
This is the flag that's gonna
make me the King of the Pirates.

373
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,628
Yeah, I've heard that before.

374
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,730
Still, I think you can do it.

375
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,266
I mean, after all,
you are our captain.

376
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,636
Nobody's ever
gonna take us down.

377
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,685
[cannon fire]

378
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,427
[laughing]

379
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:22,301
[RANDOM PIRATE 330A]
The Phoenix flag! Ahhh!

380
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,435
What? Really?

381
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,870
You gotta be kidding me.

382
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,538
You're clearly not
cut out to be a pirate

383
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,540
if you're that afraid
of a little fight.

384
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,842
"A little fight," huh?

385
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,677
They know the beat down
that's in store for them

386
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,178
when they see that flag.

387
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,213
[PUZZLE] Yeah.

388
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,539
[LUFFY coughing]

389
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,407
[CHOPPER] Luffy!

390
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,810
--I thought you were done for!
--He's all right.

391
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,912
[CHOPPER] Don't ever do
something like that again!

392
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,847
You really scared me!

393
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,749
I'm so happy you're alive!

394
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,679
[chuckling]

395
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:41,780
[CAMPACINO] For you.

396
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,585
They still haven't caught them?

397
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,287
You got their
flag though, right?

398
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,788
[CAMPACINO]
It'll be here soon, Papa.

399
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,790
You just relax.

400
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,625
Do I not look relaxed?

401
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,561
[CAMPACINO]
Oh no, of course you do.

402
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,297
But everyone seems to be
dragging out the fun a bit,

403
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,466
so I hope you don't mind, Papa.

404
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,303
Wait.
Did somebody just walk by?

405
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,271
[CAMPACINO]
No. I don't think so.

406
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,273
Maybe you've had too much wine.

407
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,308
[ACCINO] Hm...

408
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,314
Well, hurry up with that flag.

409
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,250
[CAMPACINO] Sure.
I'll check on their progress.

410
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,484
Hey.

411
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,118
[CAMPACINO] Yes?

412
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,987
I want Straw Hat's bounty.

413
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,489
Don't worry, Papa,
you'll get it.

414
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,268
What the hell's
this place 'sposed to be?

415
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,980
Ha! The next duel
will be decided by speed!

416
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,349
Speed, huh?

417
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,417
All right, if that's
how you wanna play.

418
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,620
Coup De Vent!

419
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,255
[HOCKERA]
Hoh ke!

420
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,362
[whistle]

421
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,298
[HOCKERA] Game over.

422
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,534
Super!

423
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:13,038
Oh... Guess that
was the last of my cola.

424
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,375
What's taking so long?
It's too cold to be out here.

425
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,510
[FRANKY]
Well, that was some fight.

426
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,679
Sorry. That took a while.

427
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,614
[NAMI] I was gonna see if
I could find a warmer place

428
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:26,018
so I tried to make this thing
work, but it won't even turn on.

429
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,686
It's no use.

430
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,054
[FRANKY]
What's the problem here?

431
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,455
I have no idea.

432
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,857
That rumble was so annoying.

433
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,725
And it's too
cold to think clearly.

434
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,627
Just get this thing working.

435
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:36,662
Rumble?

436
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:37,863
Mm-hmm.

437
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,535
Oh, crap.

438
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,045
[HOCKERA]
Hoh ke ke ke!

439
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,880
[HOCKERA]
There! It's frozen over!

440
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:55,847
Your fault.

441
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,816
Never let your guard down.

442
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,821
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

443
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:03,989
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL]
Click.

444
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,924
Yeah? What is it?

445
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,492
Right. Yeah.

446
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,760
Two?

447
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,729
Well, that's pretty good.

448
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,097
Sure. Okay.

449
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,532
I understand.

450
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:14,566
[sighs]

451
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,583
[LIL] Go! Flying fish!

452
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,689
Okay, let's get
back to the game.

453
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,757
[ROBIN] What happened?

454
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,525
That was one of
my older brothers.

455
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,928
He said he captured
two of the bounties.

456
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,630
[LIL] This one, and this one.

457
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,700
[LIL] But forget about that.
I wanna play some more. C'mon.

458
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:49,901
Right. Of course.

459
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,938
But wouldn't it be more fun
if we played at your house?

460
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,607
Huh? You actually
wanna go play at my house?

461
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,975
[ROBIN]
Sure, will you take me there?

462
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,043
Yeah!

463
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,751
[HOCKERA]
Hoh ke ke! Hoh ke ke!

464
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:06,651
--Let us out of here,
--Damn it, let us out!

465
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,652
--you stupid jerk!
--Damn it, let us out!

466
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,822
[HOCKERA] Hoh ke ke!
Hoh ke hoh ke hoh ke ke!

467
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,625
[HOCKERA]
Hoh ke ke!

468
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:20,932
[LUFFY] Whoa, what's going on?

469
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,968
How can there be
two of the same guy?

470
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,003
[CHOPPER]
Oh, is it a Devil Fruit power?

471
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,506
[LUFFY] Maybe it's some kind
of cool fighting technique.

472
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,674
Hey, Chopper! Let's try it, too!

473
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,610
[CHOPPER]
Yeah! I want another me!

474
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,779
But how do we do it?

475
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,480
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

476
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,681
Hot Full Throttle!

477
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,518
The Twins' Magnetic
Power Drawing Near!

478
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,953
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
