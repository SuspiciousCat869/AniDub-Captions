At the brink of war,

No idea.

not know where they are?

He must've eaten another cactus.
He's gone crazy.

Jeez. Why can't he
stay out of trouble

00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,891

Yeah, he's in pretty bad shape.
Well, up to you.

Why's it my job?

Right. Now, let's get going.

But don't you think that
we should wait for the others?

78
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,750
They can catch up by
following our footprints.

79
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,585
[NAMI] Knowing them, they
shouldn't have a hard time

80
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,487
finding us again,
and in the meantime,

81
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,322

up and stick the fool

[ZORO] I'm used to dealing
with him when he's being crazy,

102
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,741
but it never gets
any less annoying.

[ZORO] How did I end up
following a captain like him

00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,430
in the first place?

What's going on here?

114
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,534
What in the world
happened to you two?

115
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,635
Hey, Zoro!

116
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,037
Hey! Hello?

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,305
Wake up!

00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,074
Come on.

120
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:19,812
[ZORO]
Thanks for that.

121
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,381
So, what happened?

122
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,749
[ZORO]
Long story.

123
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,484
[CHOPPER]
Luffy's still stuck in the sand.

124
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,486
[ZORO] Let's just leave
him there for now.

125
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,620
Where're the others?

126
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,123
I don't know. When I woke up,
they had disappeared.

127
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,759
How considerate of them.
Oh, well.

128
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,926
We'll have to follow
their footprints

129
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,661
through the sand then.

130
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,996
[CHOPPER]
What footprints?

131
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,666
I know you!

132
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,769
You're that mean
jerk Crocodile, right?

133
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,670
It's time to wake up, moron!

134
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,406
Wait, where are the others at?

135
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,440
Welcome back.

136
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,241
Where did they all go,

137
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,675
and why aren't
we following them?

138
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,010
We fell behind
because we were trying

139
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,245
to take care of you!

140
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,747
[LUFFY] Chopper, you can track
stuff with your nose, right?

141
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,015
[CHOPPER]
That's what I'm trying to do.

142
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,017
But I can't smell
anything at all.

143
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,952
You don't know which way to go?

144
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,088
Can you tell which way
the wind's blowing from?

145
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,990
The wind's blowing
in from our left,

146
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,092
but that's about all I can tell.

147
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:06,959
Okay.

148
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,795
Since Chopper
can't smell anything,

149
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,430
we know they aren't
in that direction.

150
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,664
You don't know
what you're saying.

151
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,033
[ZORO] Fine, you can just stay
right there if you want to!

152
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:14,934
Come on, Chopper.

153
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,702
[CHOPPER]
Oh, okay.

154
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,871
[LUFFY]
Hey guys, wait for me!

155
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,940
You can't just leave me here!

156
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,647
[LUFFY]
So hot.

157
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,715
Is Luffy going to be all right?

158
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,385
It'll take a lot more
than cactus to kill him.

159
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,152
[CHOPPER]
Zoro?

160
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,120
What is it?

161
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,122
[CHOPPER] Is being a
pirate always like this?

162
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,323
Like what?

163
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,959
[CHOPPER] You know, climbing
mountains, crossing deserts.

164
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,627
I see what you mean.

165
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,996
Well, we aren't really
a normal pirate crew.

166
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,832
And then there's
our insane captain.

167
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,902
I'm wondering if maybe I
got on board the wrong ship.

168
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,003
What do you know?

169
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,906
I was just starting to think
the same thing myself.

170
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,041
[CHOPPER]
Hey.

171
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,075
[ZORO]
Yeah?

172
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,743
[CHOPPER] You were the
first out of everyone here

173
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,646
to join Luffy's crew,
isn't that right?

174
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,216
[ZORO] Yep, but the rest of
them came on pretty quickly

175
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,984
after that.

176
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,587
[CHOPPER] What made you
join in the first place?

177
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,222
[ZORO]
Why do you ask that?

178
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,557
[CHOPPER] I know I just joined,
but it seems like everyone

179
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,092
on the crew sort of
does their own thing

180
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,827
instead of really
working together.

181
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:15,928
Especially you.

182
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,730
[ZORO]
Yeah, that's pretty accurate.

183
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,098
I have my own reasons
for being here

184
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,068
and for joining the crew
in the first place.

185
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,936
It's like that for
the others, too.

186
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,705
None of us have the
same goals in mind

187
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,607
as Luffy does.

188
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,108
We all basically
do our own thing

189
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,576
for our own reasons.

190
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,044
It may seem a
little weird at times,

191
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,880
but it works for us, anyway.

192
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,582
It can look crazy,
like we have no idea

193
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,751
what teamwork is.

194
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,686
Especially when you
look at our captain.

195
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,021
He's a real handful.

196
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,524
Yeah, I'm with you on that one.

197
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,792
But still, what is
teamwork exactly

198
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,562
when you get right down to it?

199
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,264
Is it just about
protecting each other,

200
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,732
and helping each other out?

201
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,469
I guess most people
would say so,

202
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,137
but they're just
fooling themselves.

203
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,473
I think real teamwork
is about more than that

204
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,474
in the end.

205
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,643
It's about individuals
taking individual risks,

206
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,977
if you ask me.

207
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,979
You work together by
working separately.

208
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,915
You stand up and
risk your own life.

209
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,750
You do what you can
the best that you can

210
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,920
and then you turn to the others
and expect the same from them.

211
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,922
When you think about it
that way, what's so wrong

212
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,990
with everyone on the crew
having their own agenda?

213
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,792
You know?

214
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,794
But that's my opinion.

215
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,162
[CHOPPER]
I think I understand.

216
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,730
So that's what Usopp
meant when he said

217
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,265
"just do whatever you can."

218
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,167
[ZORO chuckles]

219
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,736
It sounds like a cop‐out
coming from him, though.

220
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,507
As for why I've stayed
on board with this crew?

221
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,742
Working beside him all
this time has ended up

222
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,812
giving me another
goal to work toward.

223
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,614
[CHOPPER]
So what's your new goal?

224
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,517
[ZORO] Sorry. I don't
know how to explain that.

225
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,855
[LUFFY]
Someplace shady! Finally!

226
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,857
Gum‐Gum...

227
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,761
[LUFFY]
Rocket!

228
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,165
[ZORO, CHOPPER yelling]

229
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,607
[LUFFY]
Ah! Nice and cool!

230
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,109
[laughing]

231
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,344
I should cut you in half!

232
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,312
Right, sorry about that!
Heh heh!

233
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,214
Hey, where's Chopper?

234
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,949
Oh! There he is!

235
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,985
What's Chopper doing out there?

236
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,621
He's a pretty weird guy, huh?

237
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,055
Yeah, this is my fault.

238
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,290
I'm sorry.

239
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,626
[ZORO] There's really no point
in talking to you sometimes,

240
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,893
you know that?

241
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,695
[yells]

242
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,897
[LUFFY] Hey, what's up
with this big hole here?

243
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,634
[ZORO] How should I
know that, you idiot?!

244
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,068
[LUFFY]
You okay down there?

245
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,803
[ZORO]
Dammit.

246
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,805
That really didn't feel good.

247
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,207
So where in the hell am I?

248
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,382
[ZORO]
What the‐‐?

249
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,835
Interesting.

250
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,243
What is something like this...

251
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,611
...doing underground?

252
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,179
[ZORO] What the hell are
you doing down here?

253
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,013
[LUFFY]
Lowered myself in.

254
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,748
[ZORO]
And what did you do that for?

255
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,716
[LUFFY]
Why not?

256
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,117
[ZORO] Why? Because
with you down here too,

257
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,686
we'll probably end up
getting separated

258
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,788
from Chopper.
And without his nose,

259
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,023
we're never gonna catch up
with Vivi and the others.

260
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,758
Nah, that shouldn't
be a problem.

261
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,693
[ZORO]
Why's that?

262
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,761
[LUFFY] Chopper's falling
down here, too.

263
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:36,962
[CHOPPER yells]

264
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,800
[LUFFY]
See?

265
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,470
Where am I?

266
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,077
Hey! Guys! Where are we?

267
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,112
[ZORO] I have no idea
what this place is.

268
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:56,816
All I know is that we're
definitely underground.

269
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:57,650
'Kay.

270
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,085
[NAMI]
I'm exhausted.

271
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,286
Why don't we take a break?

272
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,821
[SANJI]
Of course, Nami!

273
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,990
[NAMI]
Oh, come on, Usopp.

274
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,892
You really are pathetic.

275
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,227
[USOPP]
Easy for you to say!

276
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,795
You got to ride Eyelash!

277
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,831
I've been walking
the whole time!

278
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,165
Thanks for the ride, Eyelash.

279
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,736
Hey.

280
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:17,837
The other three.

281
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,138
How will they find us here?

282
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,806
We are up on top of a hill.

283
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,075
We should be visible,
even from a pretty long

284
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,310
distance away.

285
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,611
I hope you're right.

286
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,915
So, how long do we
have before we get there?

287
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,917
[VIVI]
Since we made it to these ruins,

288
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,919
we should be able to
get to Yuba by night

289
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,855
if we keep on walking.

290
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,323
Finally, we're getting close.

291
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,658
[SANJI] So these are ruins
of old buildings and stuff?

292
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,027
Yes, and they've been
sitting here for a long time,

293
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,329
I'd guess.

294
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,698
Civilization began
here on Alabasta

295
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,299
thousands of years ago.

296
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,035
Many kingdoms have risen
and fallen since that time,

297
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,971
and for many reasons.

298
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:56,008
Resettlement in search
of water, the occasional war.

299
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,110
Ruins of civilizations
like this one exist

300
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,779
throughout the country.

301
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,214
Many of them we know
almost nothing about.

302
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,116
[SANJI] And centuries
passed, one by one,

303
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,852
leading to the current
Alabasta kingdom.

304
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,355
An epic that always repeats.

305
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,625
Kingdoms rise and fall,
here one day, gone the next.

306
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,026
It's romantic.

307
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:14,827
Sanji!

308
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,730
Oh, um... My apologies.

309
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,365
Really, sorry, Vivi.

310
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,966
I was just babbling on.

311
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,701
Pay no attention to me.

312
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,903
[VIVI]
It's all right.

313
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,072
Actually, I've found myself
thinking the same thing lately.

314
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,076
What makes a country?
Not its ruler.

315
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,078
Even if the ruler dies,
the country's people

316
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,816
will keep on living.
Culture, faith.

317
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,250
Those can remain
the same even when

318
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,885
a country's rule changes.

319
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,921
So is it really necessary
to try and preserve

320
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,156
everything just as it is now?

321
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,858
What needs protecting?

322
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,093
And what do we let go of?

323
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,395
I've been thinking
about this ever since

324
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:53,199
the sand pirates and the town
with the fake rebel soldiers.

325
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,100
It's all just so
complicated now.

326
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:01,240
Oh, sorry!
I'm just babbling about this.

327
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,677
I'm sure these are
questions without answers.

328
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,846
But at least there's
one thing I do know:

329
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,347
what we need to do now.

330
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,082
Stop Baroque Works!

331
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,284
That organization is about
to cause a pointless war

332
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,953
with their malicious scheming.

333
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,421
They're trying to
destroy this country,

334
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,956
and we have to stop them.

335
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,791
No matter what the cost may be.

336
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,260
I don't care how difficult
it is or what the dangers are,

337
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,262
they absolutely
have to be stopped!

338
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:26,031
Crocodile will never
get what he wants.

339
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,399
Not while I'm alive.

340
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,636
[USOPP] Well, I guess we
should get going now, huh?

341
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,037
Usopp, are you sure
you're all right?

342
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,973
[USOPP] Oh, please!
Are you kidding me?

343
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,442
I'm feeling so strong
right now it almost hurts.

344
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,576
Liar.

345
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,945
My legs are shaking because
I've got so much energy!

346
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,647
You haven't seen
strong until you've seen

347
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,215
Captain Usopp in action!

348
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,818
I won't waver or
fall for one second!

349
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,920
[yelps]

350
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,121
[USOPP]
What did you do that for?!

351
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,322
[NAMI]
All right, we should get going.

352
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,058
[VIVI] What? Shouldn't we wait
for Luffy and the others?

353
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,393
[NAMI]
You're such a worrier.

354
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,296
Luffy is absolutely
determined to beat Crocodile.

355
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,898
Once he has his mind
set on something,

356
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,966
you can just let him
do his own thing.

357
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,134
You know that.

358
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,276
There, my eyes are adjusting.

359
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,410
From what I can tell,

360
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,445
we're in some
kind of giant dome.

361
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,682
[CHOPPER] Yeah, and I think
people used to live here, too.

362
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,850
[ZORO]
What?

363
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,752
[CHOPPER] These look like
ancient ruins or something.

364
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,020
[ZORO]
How can you tell that?

365
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,254
Look at this thing.

366
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,691
It's almost entirely covered
with rows of written characters.

367
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,327
I've seen something just
like this in a book before.

368
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,129
It's like an ancient alphabet.

369
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,433
[LUFFY] Who cares about
stupid stuff like that anyway?

370
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,435
The only thing I care
about is that it's cool

371
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,038
and shady in here.
So nice!

372
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,040
[ZORO]
Okay, let's say you're right.

373
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,309
But then, what's this place
doing underground?

374
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,210
[CHOPPER]
Well... I don't know why.

375
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,845
Was it built underground?

376
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,315
Or was it buried sometime
after it was built?

377
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,050
Either way, I get the
feeling that they're trying

378
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,719
to hide the building
for some reason.

379
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,487
Well, whoever made this place,
it must've taken them

380
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,890
a long time.

381
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,959
Whatever it is, it has
nothing to do with us,

382
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,493
so what's the point
in thinking about it?

383
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,395
Besides, at the moment we
need to be thinking about

384
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,831
how to get out of here.
Right, Captain?

385
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,333
[LUFFY]
But why? It's nice in here.

386
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,068
[ZORO]
Just get up already, will you?

387
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,469
[LUFFY]
No, I don't wanna!

388
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,905
Let's just stay in here a
little while longer, okay?

389
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,874
It's really, really hot outside!

390
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,209
All right, let's get going.

391
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,144
We've gotta hurry and
catch up with the others.

392
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,848
That hole's where Zoro
fell on his ass, right?

393
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,083
[ZORO]
Shut up!

394
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,086
[LUFFY]
Heh. Gum‐Gum...

395
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,887
Pistol!

396
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,527
[ZORO]
What are you trying to do?

397
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,096
Damn it, I just missed.

398
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,431
It's really hard to hit
a target that small.

399
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,499
[LUFFY yells]

400
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,336
There, I got it.

401
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,939
[LUFFY groaning]

402
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,408
[ZORO] And I say again,
what are you trying to do?

403
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,843
Why don't you just
grab the boulder

404
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,077
beside the hole?

405
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,246
[LUFFY coughs]

406
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,949
This is really starting
to bug me!

407
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,917
Gum‐Gum Gatling!

408
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:06,225
[LUFFY yelling]

409
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,794
[CHOPPER, ZORO yell]

410
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,970
Right, now that's better!

411
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,204
What are you doing,
you crazy idiot?

412
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,373
What're you gonna grab onto
now that you broke the boulder

413
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,574
up there?

414
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,143
[LUFFY]
Oh, calm down.

415
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,545
It's all right. I have an idea.

416
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,614
Chopper, you should
probably get little though.

417
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,581
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

418
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,583
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum!

419
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,254
Oh, I think I see
what he's doing.

420
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,321
Coming?

421
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,457
Accept it. We have to do this.

422
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,126
Here we go!

423
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,432
[LUFFY]
Spring!

424
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,472
[LUFFY]
Woo‐hoo!

425
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,413
Luffy, how are we going to land?

426
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,115
Don't know!

427
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,016
Oh, no!

428
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,452
[ZORO] Didn't I tell you
just to accept it?

429
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,854
[CHOPPER] Yeah, but you
didn't mention this part!

430
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:21,867
[LUFFY laughing]

431
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,169
Well, we're free now!

432
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,205
Hey, where did they go?

433
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,539
Ah! There they are!

434
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,509
[CHOPPER]
Yeah. That settles it.

435
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,278
I definitely chose
the wrong ship to join.

436
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,647
Yep, I know what
you mean, Chopper.

437
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:39,017
'Cause that's just
what I was thinking.

438
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,393
You're falling behind.

439
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,461
[USOPP grunts]

440
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,865
What happened to all
that strength and energy

441
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,666
you had, Captain Usopp?

442
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,667
[USOPP]
Oh, that?

443
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,337
I meant it in more of
a metaphorical sense,

444
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,239
not literally.

445
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,406
Well, hang in there.

446
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,142
Just a little bit longer.

447
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,247
[NAMI]
Still worried, huh?

448
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,715
[VIVI]
Oh, no.

449
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,416
It's written all over your face.

450
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,851
Yeah, I guess it is.

451
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,254
I'm sure they're okay, really.

452
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,091
I seriously doubt you'll
ever stop being a worrier.

453
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,660
But that isn't always
necessarily a bad thing.

454
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,665
[VIVI]
You know, you guys are amazing.

455
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:27,900
[NAMI]
Huh?

456
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,202
[VIVI] I've been thinking about
it ever since Little Garden.

457
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,604
You all seem to have so
much faith in one another.

458
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,173
How do you do that?

459
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,274
[NAMI]
How?

460
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,376
I guess it's not really
something I'm conscious of.

461
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,444
I've never really
thought about it before.

462
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,413
[VIVI]
That's what's so amazing.

463
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,215
That kind of unconditional
faith in others

464
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,250
is really difficult to come by.

465
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,618
[NAMI]
I can't say for sure,

466
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,754
but maybe we trust each
other because we all do

467
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,190
whatever we can
the best that we can.

468
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,760
A while back,
Luffy said something

469
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,929
on my home island that
makes a lot of sense now.

470
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,131
You're right, I don't know
how to use a sword,

471
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,899
you bastard!

472
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,235
I'm a terrible sailor.

473
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,537
I definitely can't cook.

474
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,939
And I can't even lie!

475
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:07,739
[USOPP]
Hey!

476
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,374
And without my
friends to help me,

477
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,643
I would've been dead
a long time ago!

478
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,214
[NAMI]
I remember those words well.

479
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,448
And I thought,

480
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,384
"Huh. This is something that
makes these pirates different.

481
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,653
This is how they are."

482
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,223
If you're alone,
your strength is limited.

483
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,325
There's only so much
that one person can do,

484
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,392
after all.

485
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,827
One isn't enough.

486
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,329
You need friends.

487
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,164
But at the same time,
it amounts to nothing

488
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,399
if those friends aren't
trying every bit as hard

489
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,635
as you to do what they can do.

490
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,804
Well, I don't know if
that was an answer.

491
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:41,773
It's great.

492
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:42,975
It's really hard to keep
your thoughts straight

493
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,510
in this heat! [laughs]

494
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,815
[VIVI] Actually, that
answered a lot. Really.

495
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,252
I wonder if that kind
of faith is part

496
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,487
of this country as well.

497
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,823
[LUFFY]
Zoro, Chopper, hurry!

498
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:58,991
Right.

499
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,826
He gets all of his energy
back now that it's starting

500
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,294
to cool off.

501
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,098
[ZORO]
What's up?

502
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,934
The wind changed.
I can smell...

503
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:09,768
[ZORO]
What?

504
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,204
I'm sure of it.
It's Nami's perfume.

505
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:12,971
Over there.

506
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,374
[ZORO]
Good work! Luffy!

507
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,842
We found Nami and the others!

508
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,343
In the sunset direction!

509
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,480
Really? Hey, you guys!

510
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,715
We're coming!

511
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,217
[ZORO]
Don't run off on your own!

512
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,885
We'll get separated again!

513
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,220
Slow down!

514
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,739
[VIVI] I've learned
so much just by knowing

515
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,309
this strange pirate crew.

516
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,543
Maybe.

517
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,846
Maybe these people can
help heal my country.

518
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:11,396
<i>♪Remember when we</i>

00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,550
<i>I can hear it calling!</i>

525
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,786
<i>There's no other way...</i>
<i>the time is now!</i>

526
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:38,523
<i>I know that this is</i>
<i>what I'm born to do!</i>

527
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:44,463
<i>Don't look back,</i>
<i>let's keep on swimming now!</i>

528
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:50,736
<i>At breakneck speed, I know</i>
<i>we'll arrive there soon!</i>

529
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,705
<i>If we do not give up,</i>

530
00:22:53,739 --> 00:23:01,380
<i>Someday we'll wash up on that</i>
<i>white beach we dreamed up,</i>

531
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,549
<i>It's really not</i>
<i>all that far away...♪</i>

532
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,498
[LUFFY]
Did we make it to Yuba?

533
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,500
I can't tell with all
this sand everywhere.

534
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,601
[VIVI]
Something's not right.

535
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:23,568
[ZORO]
This is horrible!

536
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,070
[SANJI] I thought this
was some kind of oasis.

537
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,772
[VIVI]
The sand is taking over!

538
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,507
The oasis has been swallowed up!

539
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,908
[CHOPPER]
And there isn't any water.

540
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,110
[NAMI] Well, the rebel army
doesn't seem to be here.

541
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,845
[VIVI]
I must stop the rebellion!

542
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,514
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

543
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,084
"Spiders Café at 8 o'Clock!
The Enemy Leaders Gather!"

544
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,753
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
