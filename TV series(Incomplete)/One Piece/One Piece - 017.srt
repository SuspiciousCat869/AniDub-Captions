00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,796
I wouldn't have been able to
protect the village without you.

176
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,631
Give credit where
credit's due.

177
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,567
If you'd just stood
by and done nothing,

178
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,669
I wouldn't have done
anything, either.

179
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,504
Yeah! Same here!

180
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,905
Who cares about any of that?

181
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,675
I've got my hands on this
sweet, sweet treasure now.

182
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,909
And I couldn't be happier.

183
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,978
[USOPP laughs]

184
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,119
Everything that happened
here today helped me.

185
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,356
I've just come to a very
difficult decision...

186
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,025
[LUFFY]
Uh?!

187
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:17,817
[CARROT] Captain Usopp! What did
you want to talk to us about?

188
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,385
[USOPP] The three of
you fought well against

189
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,787
those terrible
Black Cat Pirates.

190
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,057
As Captain, I'm proud of you

191
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,360
for being so brave
and courageous.

192
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,028
You're too kind.

193
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,063
We're nothing
compared to you!

194
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,498
You're embarrassing us!

195
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,234
I'm serious. You were
very courageous.

196
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,303
You were scared to death,
but you kept your cool,

197
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,406
worked together as a team
and kept Kaya safe.

198
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,376
Thanks to you, we overcame our
biggest and most important

199
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,078
battle since we formed the
Usopp Pirates five years ago.

200
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,546
That was when you
three brave soldiers

201
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,315
were only four years
old. Remember?

202
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,082
[CHILDREN]
Yep!

203
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,418
Now I know this
is sudden, but...

204
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,855
I've decided that I'm gonna
set out to sea by myself.

205
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,990
[PEPPER, ONION, CARROT]
Uh...?

206
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,896
I'm finally gonna leave this
place and become a real pirate!

207
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,569
At first, I wasn't sure
what I would do.

208
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,939
I couldn't decide if I wanted
to stay here forever or not.

209
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,576
But once I saw them, I knew deep
in my heart what I must do.

210
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,782
I feel that, as a man, I must
set out to the vast ocean. So...

211
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,284
‐‐I'm leaving this place behind!
‐‐[PEPPER, ONION, CARROT] Uh?

212
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:30,589
I leave for one reason! When
the great pirate flag beckons,

213
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:34,026
you must heed its call!

214
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,397
[CARROT]
Captain! Say it isn't so!

215
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,132
[PEPPER, ONION, CARROT panting]

216
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,967
You're lying again, right?!

217
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,904
Isn't that a bit hasty?!
There's no reason to leave!

218
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,939
I thought you loved
this village!

219
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:51,610
And what's gonna happen to the
Usopp Pirates without you?

220
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,313
[USOPP] You've been
so good to me, guys.

221
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,249
I plan to leave without
telling the villagers.

222
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,318
Give them my regards.

223
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,220
Captain...

224
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,621
No, I don't want to!

225
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:06,959
Don't go, Captain!
Just stay here! Please.

226
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:10,229
Usopp Pirates. Do you
remember this place?

227
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:14,900
This is where we first met,
and formed the Usopp Pirates.

228
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,342
[laughing] Finished!

229
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,177
[CARROT]
Hey, it's that liar guy!

230
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,946
[USOPP]
Huh? Who are you guys?

231
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,581
And why are you so
buddy‐buddy with me?

232
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,516
Well, duh! You're famous!

233
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,018
Yeah. You're a really
famous guy!

234
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,454
Right! I know, you've
come face to face

235
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:39,125
with the man that is known the
world over as Captain Usopp!

236
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,627
Actually everyone in the village
calls you Liar Usopp.

237
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,862
[PEPPER, ONION laugh]

238
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,029
[USOPP]
Ah!

239
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,431
'Kay! From this day forth,

240
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,000
you're officially members
of the Usopp Pirates!

241
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,101
[ALL]
Huh?

242
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,370
C'mon! Man up!

243
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,374
[whimpers] A lot's
happened since then, huh?

244
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,175
[DOG barks]

245
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,012
[USOPP]
A Cerberus! Scare it away!

246
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:04,016
A dragon! Capture it!

247
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,018
Flour Star!

248
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,154
[PEPPER]
You're amazing, Captain!

249
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,321
‐‐[USOPP laughs]
‐‐[CHILDREN sigh]

250
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:13,392
[USOPP] But of course! I'm
a brave warrior of the sea!

251
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,562
Please don't talk about the
old days! I can't stand it!

252
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,898
Pepper's right! It's
much too painful.

253
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,700
This kind of lie isn't like
you, Captain! It's not fun.

254
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,570
Why would you say that
you're going to leave us?

255
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,373
[CARROT]
You're not serious, are you?

256
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,409
[ONION] You're being stupid,
Captain! Stupid!

257
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,380
[CHILDREN cry]

258
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,420
All right, men! Tell me
what all your ambitions are!

259
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,390
When I grow up my dream
is... to run a pub!

260
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,359
My whole life I've wanted
to be a master carpenter!

261
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,595
My goal is to
become a writer!

262
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,931
Then, swear to me
now that each of you

263
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,267
will continue on your paths!
Promise me that you will never

264
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,938
let the fires of your
ambitions die out!

265
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,075
[USOPP]
As of today...

266
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,210
our group...

267
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:08,514
the Usopp Pirates... [cries]

268
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:16,121
[USOPP]
... are disbanded!

269
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,032
Now that we've eaten, we
should probably get going.

270
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,367
Yeah, you're right.

271
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,370
[KAYA]
Here you are!

272
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,238
Hello there, Miss!

273
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,306
Are you all right
being out of bed?

274
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,208
[KAYA]
Yes.

275
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,744
I think now I can truly
start recovering.

276
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,646
You see, my sickness this
last year was caused

277
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,382
by the mental shock of
losing both my parents.

278
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:47,319
And Usopp's friendship
helped me start getting better.

279
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,990
I can't stay in bed
forever, you know.

280
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,158
You've all done
so much for me.

281
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,094
I can't thank you enough.

282
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,730
I've prepared a present for you
from the bottom of my heart

283
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,666
to show you how grateful I am
for everything you've done here.

284
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,669
I'd be honored if
you'd accept it.

285
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,414
[sighs] All packed!

286
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,185
[USOPP] Guess it's farewell
to this house, too.

287
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,170
[USOPP]
All right.

288
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,339
[door opens]

289
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,674
[USOPP]
Hey!

290
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:49,715
[USOPP grunting]
I can't get out!

291
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,819
This stupid backpack!

292
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,388
[USOPP grunting]

293
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,127
[USOPP yelping]

294
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,242
‐‐[LUFFY] Oh!
‐‐A real caravel!

295
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,745
[LUFFY] Are you actually
giving this to us?!

296
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,748
[KAYA] Mm‐hm. As a token
of my appreciation.

297
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,584
[MERRY]
It's a slightly older model,

298
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:29,388
but I personally designed
it and she sails like a dream.

299
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,424
She has a carvel‐make
caravel with lateen sails

300
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,159
and a central stern rudder.

301
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:38,497
She's a fine ship, and her
name is the Going Merry.

302
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,734
[MERRY] Allow me to
explain the rigging.

303
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,336
First, about the Kruger
net yard adjustment,

304
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,004
it may seem a little‐‐‐

305
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,572
Hold on! You'd be better off

306
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,341
just explaining the
technical stuff to me!

307
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,378
[LUFFY] What a cool ship!
Have you guys seen the front?

308
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,114
It's totally awesome!

309
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,782
We've loaded it with
all the provisions

310
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,784
you might need on a long voyage.

311
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,587
[LUFFY] Thanks! It leaves
nothing to beat tired!

312
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,289
That's "leaves nothing
to be desired", idiot.

313
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,125
[USOPP yelping]

314
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,459
[ALL]
Uh?!

315
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,794
[USOPP]
Somebody stop this thing!

316
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,562
Oh, no, Usopp!

317
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,799
Hey, what's he doing?
Looks fun.

318
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,401
Well, we'd better stop him.

319
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,704
That weirdo, is on a collision
course with our boat.

320
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,809
Uh. Hey, thanks guys.

321
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,444
Anytime.

322
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,312
[KAYA]
You're really doing it.

323
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,814
You're gonna take
to the ocean.

324
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,115
[USOPP]
Yeah.

325
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,619
I've decided to get going before
I have time to change my mind.

326
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,623
[USOPP]
Please, don't stop me.

327
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,826
[KAYA] I won't. I know
it's time for you to go.

328
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,429
Kaya, don't be
sad about it.

329
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,664
Just think, the next
time I come back here,

330
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,333
I'll tell you about adventures
that'll sound more like lies

331
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,669
than my old lies.

332
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,739
Good. I'll look forward to it.

333
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,843
[USOPP] You guys take care!
I hope we meet again sometime!

334
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:58,844
How come?!

335
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,646
Uh. Well... Because I...

336
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,848
Are you antisocial
or something...?

337
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,917
I'm taking off for life
on the high seas,

338
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,753
and I hope that we'll eventually
meet again, that's all.

339
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,521
What are you talkin' about?

340
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:10,589
Get on already!

341
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,290
Huh?!

342
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:14,326
We're friends. Right? So get on.

343
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,603
[USOPP]
This is it...

344
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,372
I'm really a Pirate
Captain now!

345
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,875
[LUFFY] Don't be stupid,
Usopp! I'm the Captain!

346
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,643
[ZORO, NAMI, LUFFY laugh]

347
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,712
[USOPP laughs]

348
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:37,149
[ALL laughing]

349
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,732
[CARROT]
There goes the Captain...

350
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,868
[PEPPER] He fell in with
some pretty awesome people,

351
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,202
so I'm not too worried.

352
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,904
[ONION]
Yeah, he'll be safe with them.

353
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,207
I've never seen anybody
as strong as they are.

354
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,209
He's always talked about
becoming a pirate,

355
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,878
and now he's headed off
to live his dreams!

356
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,579
You know the villagers
are gonna be sad

357
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,248
when we break the news to 'em.

358
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,816
Our Captain was the only person

359
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,985
who could liven things
up around here.

360
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,687
And now he's gone.

361
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,758
Hey! I just had a great idea!

362
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,261
[ONION, CARROT]
What is it?

363
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,863
[MERRY] They certainly
were a pleasant bunch.

364
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:25,864
[KAYA]
Merry...

365
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,232
[MERRY]
Yes?

366
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,668
[KAYA]
Lying hurts... A lot.

367
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:33,438
[MERRY]
Are you referring to Klahadore?

368
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,440
[KAYA]
No.

369
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,676
You must be talking
about Usopp.

370
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,779
You really wanted him
to stay, didn't you?

371
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,953
Miss Kaya. Years ago, one of
the villagers told me a story

372
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,923
about your good friend
Usopp's childhood.

373
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,626
Only a short time after his
father left the village

374
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:55,727
to become a pirate.

375
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:59,464
His mother, whom he was very
close to, passed away.

376
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,699
[KAYA]
Uh?

377
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,938
[USOPP]
Pirates! Pirates are here!

378
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,307
[USOPP panting]
Pirates are here!

379
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,942
Dad's pirates are here
Mom! They're here!

380
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,912
Hold on, Usopp, you mustn't
shout! Calm down!

381
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,583
Mom, we're saved! Dad
finally came back for us!

382
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:21,486
Uh. There you go with
your wild imagination again.

383
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,888
You silly boy.

384
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,557
It's true. He always said
he'd come back for us

385
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,994
and take us with him when you
got better, didn't he Mom?

386
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,495
Usopp, my dear.

387
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,565
Your father won't
be coming back.

388
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,336
But... I'm proud to have
married such a brave man

389
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,472
who dared to chase
his dreams.

390
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,507
I heard about a
special medicine...

391
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,810
This stuff can cure
any sickness!

392
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:49,014
So silly. You dream too much.

393
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:53,952
I am a dreamer! And I'm silly!
It's true. I'm proud of it!

394
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:57,422
After all, I'm the
son of a pirate!

395
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,358
Promise me one thing.

396
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,328
Promise me you'll grow up
to be brave, like him.

397
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:13,005
[USOPP]
Pirates are coming!

398
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,874
[MERRY]
Perhaps out of loneliness.

399
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,478
He continued to shout it after
his mother passed away.

400
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,980
In the hopes that one day
his father's pirate ship

401
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,784
would be at the shore, ready
to spirit him away to the sea,

402
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:29,021
and give him a family
that he never had.

403
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,893
[MERRY] The villagers say
that his outlandish lies

404
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,963
contain his most heartfelt wish.

405
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:41,566
[USOPP]
Pirates! Pirates are coming!

406
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,002
[MERRY] As someone else
who lost both parents,

407
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,405
he saw you as a kindred spirit,

408
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,541
and he couldn't sit by
and ignore your suffering.

409
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:54,980
Now it's time for you too to
rise from the ashes of tragedy.

410
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,817
And live up to the example that
Usopp worked so hard to set.

411
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,487
Yes!

412
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:09,027
[LUFFY] Cheers to a new
ship and a new crewmate!

413
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,430
[ALL laughing, cheering]

414
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,435
[KAYA] They said that they
were fighting to live.

415
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,036
Not to die.

416
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,939
Usopp's wild stories
and outlandish lies

417
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,709
always spoke of the
joy of being alive.

418
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,611
They helped me through
my grief by cheering me up

419
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,779
and telling me to live!

420
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,948
[MERRY]
Indeed!

421
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,550
Okay!

422
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,684
We're really doing this?

423
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:33,585
[ONION]
Mm‐hm.

424
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:34,720
You bet!

425
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,122
We're gonna follow in our
great Captain's footsteps!

426
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,624

One, two, three, go!

[KAYA] My life starts now,
Merry. I'm going to be a doctor.
