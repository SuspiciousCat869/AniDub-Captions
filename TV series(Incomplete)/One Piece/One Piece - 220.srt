[DRIM] Yes, it's
taken long enough,

00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,312
but I've finally found
a group of people

00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,647
with such nice memories.

00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,116

Hey.

Yes?

23
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,397
[SANJI] You wanna tell me
what's goin' on around here?

24
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,631
What?

25
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,703
The name's Sanji. I'm a cook
at the Sea Restaurant Baratie.

26
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:39,340
Last thing I remember was
going to sleep in my room.

27
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:42,076
But then I somehow wake
up in a different place

28
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:45,212
surrounded by people
I've never seen before.

29
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:48,716
You got any answers?
Like maybe why I'm here?

30
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,551
Uh... No?

00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,219

Hey, wait.

Are ya tellin' me
you aren't the guys

00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,589
that dragged me outta the drink?

00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:56,556
Do what?

35
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,627
I'm Luffy. I left my
home in Fusha Village

36
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,564
to go sailing yesterday but
got caught in a giant whirlpool.

37
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:05,332
I remember
climbing into a barrel

38
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,334
and getting dizzy
enough to puke

39
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,570
and then I woke
up in this place.

40
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:13,340
So I thought you guys
saved me or somethin'.

41
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,210
[thinking] What?
None of this adds up.

42
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,746
All I did yesterday was
shoot the breeze with Kaya

43
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,182
and then played some games
with Pepper and the other kids

44
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,386
and none of that
explains how I woke up here.

45
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,122
And it's the same for them.

46
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,791
So, you have any
idea what's goin' on?

47
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:31,925
Huh?

48
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,761
Neither of us have a clue
and that only leaves you.

[USOPP thinking] They might
find me useless and kill me

00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,601
if I don't give
them an answer.

51
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:44,572
I'll just have to try and
bluff my way through this.

52
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,241
[USOPP] All right,
if you really wanna know.

53
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,076
You probably don't
remember anything

54
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,345
'cuz your mind's trying
to repress your terror.

55
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:55,249
I mean you were attacked by a
legendary giant whale after all.

56
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,418
We were attacked
by a giant whale?

57
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,787
You got it. It swallowed
you guys whole

58
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,589
but I managed
to easily defeat it

59
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,124
and pull you two
out of its belly.

00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,628
Wow! You did all that?
Thank you!

61

Does our brave
savior have a name?

[USOPP] That's the
million berry question!

63
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,101
I'm the fearless and
much-feared leader

00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,304
of a notorious pirate crew
that rules over the East Blue!

65
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:20,274
The people fear me and
love me in equal measure!

66
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:24,010
I am known as the
intrepid Captain Usopp!

67

Wow! You mean
the Captain Usopp?!

68
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,517
What, you know him?

69
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,651
Never heard of him!

70
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:35,289
Careful, you wanna make
sure to stay on my good side.

71
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,724
I do preside over an army of

00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,226
eight thousand
pirates after all.

You what?! Eight thousand men?!

00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,063
[USOPP]
Oh, and uh...

75
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,232
You both joined up as
my servants yesterday.

76
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,133
We did?!

77
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:49,570
[SANJI]
You're lying.

78
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,305
Ah! How'd you know?!

79
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,140
[SANJI]
Well, I know you are now.

80
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,477
Ahh! You tricked me
into giving myself away!

81
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,180
Hahahahaha!
You're a funny guy, Captain!

82
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,583
[USOPP] Are you mocking me?
No one mocks me!

83
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,085
I've got too much pride
for mockery, dammit!

84
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,754
In fact, I've got so much pride

85
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:10,056
everyone I know calls
me Usopp the Proud!

86
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,662
Uh... Eh?

87
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,230
Hmm?

88
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,698
What's up?
Something wrong?

89
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,668
[USOPP]
Eh... Oh, it's just...

90
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,636
I feel like I've
done this before.

91
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,304
[LUFFY]
Same here.

92
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,208
[SANJI]
You're an idiot.

93
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,478
But that's the least
of my concerns now.

94
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,180
What we need is food.

95
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,348
I mean, how can
you expect us

96
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,750
to remember anything
on an empty stomach?

Foooood?!

98
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,654
Yeah, didn't you say you
were some kind of cook?

99
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,090
[SANJI]
A first-class cook.

100
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:46,527
They've gotta have food
somewhere aboard this ship.

101
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,629
First-class?

102
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:49,797
[USOPP]
Hey, hold on a second.

103
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,931
Hm?

104
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:53,534
[USOPP] So tell me, what
exactly is your story anyway?

105
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,468
My story?

106
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:57,404
I'm gonna be King of
the Pirates someday!

107
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,141
Huh...?

108
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,147
Oh, man, this ship has
definitely seen better days.

109
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,017
Land! Check it out!
I wonder what island that is.

110
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,154
We have a bit of a
problem, you guys.

111
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,556
It's our navigator here.

112
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,658
Oh, who're those two?

113
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,828
Are they part of your
giant pirate crew, Captain?

114
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,463
Uh... Yeah, that's it!

115
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,266
Don't tell me you've
lost your memories, too?

116
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,267
Huh?

117
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,436
Oh. I now understand how
foolish a moth must feel

118
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:32,172
as it's helplessly
drawn toward the flame.

119
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,675
I'm irresistibly
compelled to leap head first

120
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,778
into the brilliant radiance
of the beauty before me.

121
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:41,115
Enchanté, gorgeous
ladies! I'm Sanji.

122
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,717
I would love to treat you
to a gourmet dinner tonight

123
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,252
if you're available.

124
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,756

He's almost as
funny as you are!

126
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,695
He's like a different
person all of a sudden.

127
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:59,332
All right, who are these
creeps and where am I? Also...

128
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,744
Isn't that backwards?

129
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,083
What's that thing?

130
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,050
A deer.

131
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:20,287
Shut your pie hole,
human! I'm a reindeer!

132
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,355
It just talked!

133
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,422
Ahh!

Hey! I say we catch it!

135

thing alone! It's creepy!

136
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,097
[LUFFY]
Hey, girl! Help me grab this!

137
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,399

What, no way! Buzz off, loser!

138
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,534
[LUFFY]
I'm gonna get ya, furball!

139
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:40,207
Oh, boy, where do I even
begin to explain this to them?

140
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,094
[snoring]

141
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,730
[USOPP] Quit chasing me
you little deer monster!

142
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:07,368
[CHOPPER] Get away
from me! Leave me alone!

143
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,371
All right, that's
enough nonsense.

144
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,672
Anyone who wants
answers, listen up.

145
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,309
Huh?

146
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,712
Huh?

147
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,414
Hm?

148
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,816
Okay, we're listening.

149
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,351
Let's sort some things out.

150
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,221
We're currently located
somewhere in the Grand Line.

151
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,056
Did any of you remember that?

152
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,558
The Grand Line! Oh hohoho!

153
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,494
Are you seriously
happy about this?!

154
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,195
The Grand Line is
supposed to be teaming

155
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,065
with all sorts of creepy
monsters and dangerous stuff!

156
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,266
As I see it,

157
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,202
the only rational reaction
here is to panic and freak out!

158
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,673
[LUFFY] Really? It looks
just like the regular old sea.

159
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,208
You sure this is the Grand Line?

160
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,077
Navigator?

161
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,311
Why're ya lookin' at me?

162
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:54,415
Do you recognize the device
you've got strapped on your arm?

163
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:55,249
[NAMI]
Hmm?

164
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,283
What's that?!

165
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,419
It's called a log pose.

166
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,486
Huh?

167
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,554
[ROBIN] Your standard
compass doesn't work here,

168
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:06,260
so we have to use the
islands' magnetic fields.

169
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,162
It's the only way
that it's even possible

170
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,530
to navigate the Grand Line.

171
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,233
'Scuse me, Miss.

172
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,802
Do you have any suggestions
on how I can get back

173
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,704
to my restaurant
in the East Blue?

174
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,139
The last thing I need
is to lose my job.

175
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,507
You don't wanna do that.

176
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,810
Trust me, it's taken us
a ridiculously long time

177
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,645
to reach this
point in our journey.

178
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:28,182
Heading back on your
own would be suicide.

179
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,516
[ROBIN]
Just take a look.

180
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,318
We've been following
the Log Pose coordinates

181
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:34,121
for quite some time and
they've led us directly

182
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,057
to this
coral-reef-surrounded island.

183
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,427
You don't actually expect me
to believe any of this, do you?

184
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,363
Why would I possibly
travel with a group

185
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,632
of people I have
nothing in common with?

186
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:45,799
That's why.

187
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,307
[USOPP] Hey, wait isn't
that a pirate flag?

188
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,110
You mean we're
on a pirate ship?!

189
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,211
I already told you,

190
00:12:57,244 --> 00:13:00,047
you're on the intrepid
Captain Usopp's pirate ship!

191
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,781
For real?!

192
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,219
You know what's kind
of odd, Captain Usopp?

193
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:08,355
The fact that your Jolly Roger
is wearing a straw hat.

194
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,257
Huh? It is?

195
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,227
Uh that's because
this hat is mine!

196
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,129
Hey! No it's not!
Give it back!

197
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,601
You touch my
hat one more time

198
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,337
and I'll kick your butt to
the other side of the ocean!

199
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,271
What's the deal?

200
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,206
How can you remember
that it's your hat?

201
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,508
I remember all right.

202
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,144
This hat is like
treasure to me.

203
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,278
Treasure?

204
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,249
[LUFFY] A friend gave
it to me when I was little

205
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,217
and it means a whole lot.

206
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,086
I swore on this
hat that one day

207
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:42,690
I'd become a pirate
and gather up my own crew.

208
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:46,393
[NAMI] Hmph! Pirate this,
pirate that, who cares?

209
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,762
Although, one thing
is certain now.

210
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:53,200
Everything you've told us is a
big steaming pile of nonsense.

211
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,570
I hate pirates! Every
stinking last one of them!

212
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,505
So why would
I be on this ship?!

213
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,041
The only things I love
are money and tangerines

214
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,210
and I don't see
either around here!

215
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,444
Hey, now.

216
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:08,048
I don't really see any reason
for you to be so rude to us.

217
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,220
Tangerines? Like those?

218
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,588
Huh?

219
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,761
Why are those on a ship?

220
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:26,199
Aaah!!

221
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:29,670
What just happened?

222
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,405
That tree grew an arm!

223
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,274
A mystery tree!

224
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,209
[NAMI]
Just who the hell are you?!

225
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,544
Aren't you a bit more
curious about that?

226
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,713
I can tell it's one of
Bellemere's tangerines.

227
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:40,881
I'd know them anywhere.

228
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:44,451
But what exactly are they
doing here aboard this ship?

229
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,787
As much as I'd like to
answer that question for you,

230
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,290
I'm actually uncertain
of all the details.

231
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:50,357
If you really wanna know,

232
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:53,127
then I suggest you check
the logbook in your room.

233
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,128
Huh?

234
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:55,296
And if I remember correctly,

235
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:58,698
there's even a picture of
your Bellemere inside of it.

236
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,083
It's my handwriting.

237
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,361
Bellemere.

238
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:46,413
[NAMI] Bellemere! Here!
Look how many I got!

239
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,582
A bunch of them
are still green!

240
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,418
Come on, Nami!
Pay attention!

241
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,088
[NAMI] What?
They still tasted sweet.

242
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,289
[NOJIKO]
You're not 'sposed to eat them!

243
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,523
They're merchandise!

244
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:57,457
It's okay, girls.

245
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,593
We can have a few
of them for ourselves.

246
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,563
[NAMI] Yeah! You're
a real meanie, Nojiko.

247
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:04,197
I'm what?!

248
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:08,401
[BELLEMERE] All right,
go on. Get back to work.

249
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,476
I have to go back.

250
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,146
Something bad might've
happened to Cocoyashi Village.

251
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,521
So then what exactly is it?

252
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:31,725
It's a talking reindeer!

253
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,694
[CHOPPER]
Aaahh!

254
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,363
Reindeer, reindeer!

255
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,632
Don't chase it towards me!

256
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,300
Reindeer, huh?

257
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,306
That's a true
delicacy right there,

258
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,074
especially when
it's thinly sliced

259
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,243
and slowly simmered
with vegetables.

260
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,178
Whoa! You mean
we can eat it?!

261
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,647
[SANJI] Reindeer steak with
berry sauce is even better

262
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,582
if you ask me.

263
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:57,284
Then steak it is!

264
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,453
That's enough!

265
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:03,256
I ain't no human
food, you sicko!

266
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,530
You really
shouldn't eat him.

267
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:11,699
I mean, he is the
ship's doctor after all.

268
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:13,334
It is?

269
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,270
[ROBIN] Yes. <i>He</i> is a
truly brilliant doctor.

270
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,272
Better than any
human you'll meet.

271
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,073
Isn't that right?

272
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,209
Shut up!

273
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,045
You can praise me all
you want you stupid human,

274
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,181
but don't think
I like it or anything!

275
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,650
[SANJI]
Really? Ya look like ya do.

276
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,385
His name's Chopper.
He's a reindeer,

277
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,120
but he ate the
Human-Human Fruit

278
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,788
and gained human abilities.

279
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,056
He's not the only one.

280
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:39,627
I ate the Flower-Flower Fruit
and gained Devil Fruit powers.

281
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,696
And Luffy ate a Devil Fruit
as well, didn't you?

282
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,332
Yep! I ate a Gum-Gum Fruit!

283
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,768
My body's made of rubber!

284
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:50,204
[thinking] Three people
with Devil Fruit powers?!

285
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,772
This is terrifying.

286
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:56,644
And you guys are all
pirates? Real pirates?

287
00:17:56,677 --> 00:18:00,114
We are. Although, you're
a pirate too, y'know.

288
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,715
Well, I guess I'll allow it,

289
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,751
you're officially
a member of my crew.

290
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:06,787
Whattt?! But why?!

291
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,056
[SANJI]
You believe that guy?

292
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,525
[ROBIN] In any case, we've
been sailing these seas together

293
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:15,262
for quite some time now
as a seven-member crew.

294
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:16,530
Wait, seven?

295
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:17,698
You up there, swordsman?

296
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:18,799
You wanna come down?

297
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,066
[USOPP]
Huh?

298
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:28,042
It's a little early for
this much of a racket.

299
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:29,443
I was trying to sleep.

300
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:30,778
What the heck, who's this guy?!

301
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:32,446
State your name, now!

302
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,614
You're not supposed
to ask someone

303
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:36,283
for their name unless you
give yours first, you know.

304
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,652
Hi, I'm Luffy!
So what's your name?

305
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:42,456
Hm?
I'm Roronoa Zoro.

306
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,558
The pirate hunter?

307
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,628
[ZORO] That's not a description
I've ever applied to myself.

308
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:50,364
Other people
stuck me with it.

309
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,733
[SANJI] But you are still a
bounty hunter, aren't you?

310
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,803
[ZORO] Yeah, but only when I'm
starving or need money to live.

311
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:57,738
It's not my
profession or anything.

312
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:59,740
[SANJI] All right, but I'm
guessing the only reason

313
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:02,543
you're even here is 'cuz you're
on the hunt for pirates.

314
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:04,044
[ZORO]
Beats me.

315
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:07,214
I haven't the slightest
idea why I'm on this ship.

316
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,383
So, you guys notorious
pirates or somethin'?

317
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,087
This guy wants to sell
our heads for money!

318
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,388
Well, fine then, bring it on!

319
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,757
I've got eight thousand
pirates under my command!

320
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,058
Really?

321
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:18,892
Then I would imagine you have

322
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,729
a pretty hefty
bounty on your head.

323
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:25,065
And just as I was starting
to get low on food money.

324
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,434
I'd be happy to take you
on if that's what you want.

325
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:28,501
No, no, no!

326
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,070
I don't want that, that's
not what I meant at all!

327
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:31,705
Let's just take it easy, okay?!

328
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,607
Is somebody gonna
help me out over here?

329
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,409
Usopp doesn't have
a bounty on him.

330
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,711
Not even one
single solitary berry.

331
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,613
I don't?!

332
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,657
[thinking] There's gotta
be some way off this ship.

333
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,696
Huuh?!

334
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:56,964
[thinking]
It's all gold!

335
00:19:56,997 --> 00:20:01,134
There's more than enough here
to buy back Cocoyashi Village!

336
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:27,227
Now how do I get
it out of here?

337
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,367
Well that looks promising.

338
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,304
[engive revving]

339
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:44,244
Whoa! What is that thing?!

340
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,082
[USOPP]
Guh!

341
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,129
Awesome!

342
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:05,732
I can't believe this thing
runs on land and water.

343
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,070
[LUFFY]
Huh? Why'd she take off?

344
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,672
That thing is neat!

345
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,340
But our date.

346
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,708
Hmph!

347
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,677
[thinking] I don't know
what's goin' on here,

348
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,379
but I don't see any
