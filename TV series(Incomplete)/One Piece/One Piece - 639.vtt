WEBVTT

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.013
[laughing]

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:31.818
My darkness will
swallow the world,

00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:34.222
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:36.225
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.258 --> 00:01:38.363
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:42.672
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.989
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.022 --> 00:02:46.166
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.369
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:52.011
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:53.948
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:56.319
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.352 --> 00:02:58.824
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.762 --> 00:03:03.801
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:05.470
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:08.978
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:13.119
Iâ€™m gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:17.762
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:21.168
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:24.408
Their current objective is to
destroy a man-made Devil Fruit

00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:26.847
Factory in the
kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.786
Soon, Luffy becomes
sidetracked by a tournament

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.457
with the Flame-Flame
Fruit as a prize.

00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:35.163
Burgess from the Blackbeard
Pirates wins the first block

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:37.603
of the tournament and
the second rages on

00:03:37.636 --> 00:03:40.240
with fierce competitors.

00:03:40.274 --> 00:03:42.845
Meanwhile, on the
other side of town.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.683
Traffy! What gives?

00:03:44.716 --> 00:03:47.087
Why'd you pick such a
dangerous spot for the tradeoff?

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.889
Deal with it.

00:03:47.922 --> 00:03:48.924
[BOTH gasp]

00:03:48.957 --> 00:03:51.462
No point in complaining.
We're already here.

00:03:51.495 --> 00:03:54.536
More importantly, don't you
think the people in this country

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.640
are acting kind of strange?

00:03:56.673 --> 00:03:58.945
Doflamingo said he stepped down.

00:03:58.978 --> 00:04:02.184
If they don't have a king,
why is everybody so calm?

00:04:02.218 --> 00:04:04.689
We were taken by a surprise
the moment we got here.

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:06.393
[USOPP]
That's what worries me!

00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:09.966
[ELIZABELLO]
King...

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.576
...Punch!

00:04:16.646 --> 00:04:18.316
[BARTOLOMEO]
It's a Barrier!

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.723
Guess I got my Bari-Bari Fruit
to thank for that one.

00:04:23.192 --> 00:04:24.596
Barrier Crash!

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.236
[ELIZABELLO yells]

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:32.178
That means Block B's
winner is...

00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:33.748
Dammit all!

00:04:33.781 --> 00:04:36.352
Bartolomeo!

00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:48.711
[laughs]

00:04:48.744 --> 00:04:53.754
[CROWD booing]

00:04:57.227 --> 00:05:00.333
[GYATS] And the crowd is not
happy with this turn of events!

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:04.441
In a last minute upset,
Bartolomeo KO's Elizabello

00:05:04.474 --> 00:05:06.914
and becomes the
winner of Block B!

00:05:06.947 --> 00:05:11.957
[booing continues]

00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:16.232
[LUFFY] I didn't know that
peeing chicken guy

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:18.202
was so tough.

00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:21.208
First things first.

00:05:23.013 --> 00:05:25.518
[LUFFY grunts]
Looks like the ginormous grandpa

00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:28.156
and Cabbage took off.

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:29.592
Time to scram!

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:38.911
[LUFFY]
Hm...

00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:39.913
[MEDIC A]
Outta the way!

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:42.017
[MEDIC B]
Clear out!

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.219
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:05:48.062 --> 00:05:50.433
[gasps]
It's Bellamy!

00:05:56.112 --> 00:05:57.314
I heard you.

00:05:57.347 --> 00:06:00.220
[LUFFY grunts]
You okay?

00:06:00.253 --> 00:06:03.594
I can't believe you had the gall
to cheer for me back there.

00:06:03.627 --> 00:06:08.604
That was so embarrassing.
And a lot of good it did.

00:06:08.637 --> 00:06:12.845
I ain't changed one bit.
It's pathetic!

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.883
You have changed, Bellamy.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:19.926
[grunts]

00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:24.268
I've seen you wield
your Haki powers.

00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:27.542
They're stronger than anything
I've ever dreamed of.

00:06:27.575 --> 00:06:29.980
Which really pisses me off.

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:34.121
My pride's shattered, but I'll
return your compliment.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.363
You've changed, Straw Hat!

00:06:38.396 --> 00:06:39.097
[gasps]

00:06:41.402 --> 00:06:48.617
[BARTOLOMEO gasps]
Wha-- Wh-Wh-What did he say?

00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:50.053
No.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.533
[gasps]
Straw Hat's here? He can't be!

00:07:06.352 --> 00:07:11.362
[footsteps]

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:17.742
[USOPP] Man oh man.
One hell of a solid bridge!

00:07:17.776 --> 00:07:20.748
[CAESAR CLOWN chuckles]
Thanks to these bars,

00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:24.055
we're safe if any Fighting Fish
wants to attack, right?

00:07:24.088 --> 00:07:28.797
[USOPP gulps]
I hope we don't find out.

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:33.139
[LAW]
Hm...? One's approaching.

00:07:33.173 --> 00:07:34.108
[CAESAR CLOWN, USOPP gasp]

00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:35.878
What do you mean?

00:07:40.253 --> 00:07:42.390
You can't say that
and then go quiet!

00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:44.629
You weren't talking
about a-a-a--!

00:07:56.653 --> 00:07:57.722
[splashing]

00:07:57.755 --> 00:07:59.826
[gasps]
You guys hear that?

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.763
Better yet, you see that?

00:08:03.868 --> 00:08:09.344
[USOPP, CAESAR CLOWN]
It's... a Fighting Fish!

00:08:16.091 --> 00:08:20.366
[USOPP, CAESAR CLOWN yell]
And it's freakin' huge!

00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:28.116
[USOPP gasps]

00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:31.456
Given the name,
I expected an actual fish.

00:08:31.489 --> 00:08:33.092
Looks like a fish to me.

00:08:33.126 --> 00:08:35.731
Then you better get your
vision checked, buddy!

00:08:35.764 --> 00:08:38.570
That's a sea monster!
A wild beast!

00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:41.876
[USOPP yelps]
Here it comes again!

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.547
He's not alone this time!

00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:45.484
[USOPP, CAESAR CLOWN gasp]

00:08:45.518 --> 00:08:48.990
[USOPP] There's a school
of those monsters!

00:08:49.024 --> 00:08:51.428
[ROBIN] The man at the cafe said
this bridge was reinforced

00:08:51.462 --> 00:08:53.199
with iron to protect
against them.

00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:55.738
[USOPP] So there's absolutely
nothing to worry about, right?

00:08:55.772 --> 00:08:57.273
[USOPP chuckles nervously]

00:08:59.077 --> 00:09:01.115
[USOPP yells]

00:09:01.148 --> 00:09:03.654
This bridge is a piece of crap!

00:09:03.687 --> 00:09:06.191
[growls]

00:09:10.735 --> 00:09:13.574
[ROBIN] Do you think we can make
it to Green Bit at this rate?

00:09:13.607 --> 00:09:17.046
[LAW] Relax. Usopp should
be able to handle it.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.485
You're the Warlord!
You handle it!

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:22.390
There's a time and place for me
to fight, but it's not here.

00:09:22.423 --> 00:09:23.593
[USOPP gasps]

00:09:24.662 --> 00:09:26.132
Better get ready.

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:28.335
Special Attack! Green--

00:09:29.772 --> 00:09:31.375
[USOPP screams]

00:09:31.408 --> 00:09:32.444
[ROBIN]
Two from behind!

00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:34.949
[CAESAR CLOWN]
They're going to crush us!

00:09:34.982 --> 00:09:36.787
Now, Mil Fleurs!

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.960
Gigantesco Mano! Spank!

[FIGHTING FISH B groans]

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.827
Good work, now keep it up!

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.895
You kidding me?

00:09:57.929 --> 00:10:00.166
Look how many of those
things we're up against!

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.972
It's a pack! There's no way
we can fight 'em all!

00:10:03.005 --> 00:10:05.577
We gotta make a run for it!

00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:07.781
Skull Bombgrass times two!

00:10:10.587 --> 00:10:13.026
[LAW] Hey, Nose!
Unlock Caesar's restraints!

00:10:13.059 --> 00:10:14.796
He's gonna help keep
those fish off our backs!

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.198
You crazy?

00:10:16.232 --> 00:10:18.737
He's just gonna fly away
and leave us for dead!

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.010
Then I suggest he reconsider it!

00:10:22.043 --> 00:10:25.884
[CAESAR CLOWN gasps]
It can't be! Bastard!

00:10:25.918 --> 00:10:28.657
Ah! That's my heart!

00:10:31.796 --> 00:10:35.403
I swear you will all die a
miserable death very soon!

00:10:35.436 --> 00:10:37.975
No one abuses a brilliant
scientist like Casesar

00:10:38.009 --> 00:10:39.946
and lives!

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.317

00:10:45.423 --> 00:10:47.160
That's some major power!

worth 300 million!

But seriously, Law!

00:10:56.479 --> 00:10:58.550
Whenever you're ready,
we could use your help!

00:10:58.583 --> 00:11:01.522
Tell me about it!
You expect me to fight them all?

00:11:04.494 --> 00:11:09.037
When I use my powers, it saps
away my stamina bit by bit.

00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:11.977
I need to conserve every bit
of energy for the trip back!

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:13.479
Understand?

00:11:13.513 --> 00:11:16.620
If my strength is even the least
bit depleted, we're screwed!

00:11:16.653 --> 00:11:19.760
This is Doflamingo
we're going up against!

stands a chance against Joker?

[USOPP grunts]

00:11:26.906 --> 00:11:29.546
[USOPP] Oh, just perfect!
The bridge's collapsed!

00:11:29.579 --> 00:11:32.184
What are we supposed to do now?

00:11:32.217 --> 00:11:33.420
Plus the fog's so thick,

00:11:33.453 --> 00:11:36.058
who knows how much
further we have to go?

[LAW] Fighting Fish!
Headed straight for us!

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:41.569
Then we're in real trouble!

00:11:41.603 --> 00:11:44.509
We can't let it destroy
anymore of the bridge!

Today's the big battle!

00:12:17.307 --> 00:12:19.812

with Fighting Fish stew!

[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.521
Whose voices are those?

00:12:23.554 --> 00:12:26.526
People who live on
the island, I suppose.

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:27.529
What do you mean?

00:12:27.562 --> 00:12:30.567
You said it was uninhabited,
didn't you?

00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:35.343
Hey! Who's on the
other side of the bridge?

00:12:35.376 --> 00:12:38.950
Also, how do we cross
and get over there?

00:12:38.984 --> 00:12:40.487
[MALE DWARF B]
Did you hear that? It's a human!

[FEMALE DWARF B]
We gotta scram! Let's go!

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.157
Well that sure was interesting.

00:12:59.191 --> 00:13:00.193
Now what?

00:13:00.226 --> 00:13:02.965
We gotta find a way
to get across the chasm.

No need to thank me!

Eh?

I swear you're gonna
pay for this one day!

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:21.903
[USOPP]
Stop complaining!

00:13:21.936 --> 00:13:23.907
I mean, look how
great the view is!

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.310
[ROBIN] We should have
flown over like this

00:13:25.343 --> 00:13:26.879
right from the start.

00:13:26.913 --> 00:13:29.484
[USOPP]
Hey. Why didn't we, Caesar?

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:30.420
Huh?

00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:31.589
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Cut the crap, already!

00:13:31.623 --> 00:13:34.261
Do you have any idea how
much gas energy it takes

00:13:34.294 --> 00:13:35.965
to float three people?

00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:40.039
I thought hostages were supposed
to be treated humanely!

00:13:54.869 --> 00:13:58.008
[LAW] The drag marks from
the fish end at this spot.

00:13:59.545 --> 00:14:02.751
And besides us, there's not
a single person in sight.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.160
I wonder what happened
back on the bridge.

00:14:07.193 --> 00:14:09.097
[ROBIN] The waters are
filling up with shipwrecks

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.001
from the Fighting Fish attacks.

00:14:14.374 --> 00:14:17.815
[USOPP gasps]
Up ahead! What's that?

00:14:47.206 --> 00:14:50.146
[USOPP gasps]

00:14:50.179 --> 00:14:53.820
First giant fish, now plants?

00:15:04.842 --> 00:15:08.950
[USOPP] You don't actually
expect us to go in there?

00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:39.411
[CROWD cheers]

00:15:39.445 --> 00:15:42.450
Up next, we have the
battle of Block C!

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:44.522
As soon as the
arena is fixed up,

00:15:44.555 --> 00:15:47.059
then we can commence
with the slaughter!

00:15:47.093 --> 00:15:50.801
All competitors in Block C,
report to the entrance gate!

00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:53.339
[LUFFY]
Huh? Sounds like it's that time.

00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:56.613
[GYATS] I repeat!
All competitors in Block C,

00:15:56.646 --> 00:15:59.484
report to the entrance
gate immediately!

00:16:01.055 --> 00:16:03.660
[LUFFY]
Alright! Let's do it!

00:16:03.693 --> 00:16:06.231
[GYATS] Before we start,
I'd like to introduce some

00:16:06.264 --> 00:16:08.870
competitors to keep an eye on!

00:16:08.903 --> 00:16:11.341
First up is the two-time
champion of the

00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:13.847
New World Central
Fighting Tournament!

00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:17.353
"Destruction Cannon" Ideo!

00:16:17.386 --> 00:16:20.459
[CROWD cheers]

00:16:20.492 --> 00:16:22.898
[GYATS] These assassins are
in the business of killing

00:16:22.931 --> 00:16:27.608
100 million or higher bounties.
The Funk Brothers!

00:16:27.641 --> 00:16:31.516
[CROWD cheers]

00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:34.187
[GYATS] This next competitor
comes from Elbaf,

00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:37.595
the famous land of giants.

00:16:37.628 --> 00:16:42.538
I give you the formidable
"Pirate Mercenary"...

00:16:42.571 --> 00:16:43.940
[GYATS]
...Hajrudin!

00:16:43.973 --> 00:16:46.111
[CROWD cheers]

00:16:46.144 --> 00:16:47.982
[GYATS]
But wait! That's not all!

00:16:48.015 --> 00:16:51.021
Known for his penchant
for extreme violence

00:16:51.054 --> 00:16:53.560
and driving his opponents
into the corner,

00:16:53.593 --> 00:16:54.629
Jean the Bandit!

00:16:54.662 --> 00:16:56.599
[CROWD cheers]

00:16:56.632 --> 00:17:00.039
[GYATS] Also, a beast that
never stops seeing red,

00:17:00.072 --> 00:17:03.947
The Colosseum's Grim Reaper!
Brutal Bull!

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.784
[CROWD cheers]

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:08.122
[GYATS]
And today's likely winner!

00:17:08.155 --> 00:17:11.696
The terrible trio from
the Kano Kingdom!

00:17:11.729 --> 00:17:15.671
Sai...! Boo...!

00:17:15.704 --> 00:17:21.315
And the legendary
former pirate, Don Chin Jao!

00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:22.851
[CROWD cheers]

00:17:22.884 --> 00:17:25.824
[CHIN JAO]
You're mine, Straw Hat!

00:17:25.857 --> 00:17:27.628
But these are merely a sampling

00:17:27.661 --> 00:17:29.732
of the contenders
from the third Block!

00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:34.007
One things for certain,
it's gonna one hell of a match!

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.247
Prepare your eyes and
stomachs for what could be

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.351
the fiercest battle yet!

00:17:39.384 --> 00:17:43.627
[CROWD cheers]

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.866
[NARRATOR] But first, let's go
back in time a moment...

00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:52.043
[NARRATOR] ...and over to a
nearby town in Dressrosa.

00:18:09.812 --> 00:18:11.382
[VIOLET gasps]

00:18:11.415 --> 00:18:12.851
What's the matter?

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:14.522
[VIOLET]
This was a terrible idea!

00:18:14.556 --> 00:18:16.525
You should go back!

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:19.665
I'm sorry, Sanji.
I must be out of my mind!

00:18:19.699 --> 00:18:21.969
Why else would I
ask you to do this?

00:18:22.003 --> 00:18:24.675
Could you ever forgive me?

00:18:24.708 --> 00:18:28.149
Begging you to kill
such a dangerous man!

00:18:28.182 --> 00:18:30.386
Why did I bring it up?

00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:33.459
I suppose because
you're strong, but still...

00:18:33.492 --> 00:18:35.329
I was trying to use you.

00:18:37.334 --> 00:18:40.507
[VIOLET]
Please! Just walk away!

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.414
You shouldn't get tangled
up with someone like me!

00:18:44.447 --> 00:18:46.184
If something happened to you,

00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:49.725
I don't think my
heart could bear it.

00:18:54.802 --> 00:18:58.208
You said this low life
is in that storage room?

00:18:58.241 --> 00:19:00.379
Is that right?

00:19:00.413 --> 00:19:01.415
Wait here.

00:19:01.448 --> 00:19:03.385
[gasps]

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.462
[grunts] Aren't you going
to ask the reason?

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:11.669
[SANJI]
What do you mean?

00:19:11.702 --> 00:19:13.840
[VIOLET gasps]

00:19:13.874 --> 00:19:18.015
You never asked.
Why I wanted you to kill him!

00:19:18.048 --> 00:19:19.619
[SANJI]
I don't need to question you.

00:19:19.652 --> 00:19:21.188
[gasps]

00:19:21.221 --> 00:19:23.492
[SANJI]
Your tears were reason enough.

00:19:23.526 --> 00:19:26.867
[gasps]
My sweet Sanji!

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.936
You should stay here.

00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:34.581
It won't take me but a minute.

00:19:34.615 --> 00:19:38.422
Leave everything up to
your faithful bodyguard.

00:19:38.455 --> 00:19:40.059
[gasps]

00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:43.934
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE
A, B chuckle]

00:19:43.967 --> 00:19:45.937
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE C yells]

00:19:48.877 --> 00:19:51.549
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE C gasps]
What the-- Who's there?

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.669
[SANJI] I suggest you
smoke 'em if you got 'em.

00:20:01.702 --> 00:20:04.642
Cause today could be the last
time you get the chance.

00:20:04.675 --> 00:20:07.982
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
Huh? Who the hell are you?

00:20:08.015 --> 00:20:09.250
[SANJI]
One look at you,

00:20:09.284 --> 00:20:12.423
and I can tell you're that
creep that made Violet suffer.

00:20:12.456 --> 00:20:16.197
Oh really? That woman
put you up to this?

00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:19.103
My angel has a name
and it's Violet.

00:20:19.137 --> 00:20:21.976
She's smart to want a louse
like you outta her life.

00:20:22.009 --> 00:20:25.049
What did you say?
Screw you, pal!

00:20:25.082 --> 00:20:26.919
Go end this punk!

00:20:29.525 --> 00:20:31.830
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B] What're
you doing standing around?

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:33.866
I told you to kill him!

00:20:35.436 --> 00:20:37.340
Don't make me waste my time.

00:20:37.374 --> 00:20:38.877
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE D grunts]
Say that again!

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.379
Let's shut him up for good!

00:20:40.412 --> 00:20:44.487
[PIRATES yell]

00:20:44.521 --> 00:20:48.396
[SANJI]
Oeil! Flanchet! Joue! Poitrine!

00:20:48.429 --> 00:20:51.535
Party Table Kick Course!

00:21:02.223 --> 00:21:04.294
[SANJI]
I tried to tell you.

00:21:04.327 --> 00:21:06.999
I don't have time
for you chumps.

00:21:07.032 --> 00:21:08.268
[PIRATES gasp]

00:21:08.301 --> 00:21:09.103
[VIOLET yells]

00:21:09.137 --> 00:21:10.874
[SANJI gasps]
Violet, my love!

00:21:10.907 --> 00:21:12.745
Save me, Sanji!

00:21:12.778 --> 00:21:14.046
I've had enough of you!

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.148
Stay back!

00:21:15.182 --> 00:21:17.486
I'm only gonna tell
you this once.

00:21:17.521 --> 00:21:18.723
Unhand her, or die.

00:21:18.756 --> 00:21:21.428
No! Listen to me!
Want her to live?

00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:23.600
Then you better not
move a single muscle.

00:21:23.633 --> 00:21:24.502
Or I'll have to--

00:21:24.535 --> 00:21:27.040
[gasps]

00:21:27.073 --> 00:21:30.847
Rgh! Where'd he go? Dammit!

00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:31.516
[SANJI]
Down here.

00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:32.717
[gasps]

00:21:36.224 --> 00:21:38.295
[SANJI] I refuse to
show mercy to any man

00:21:38.328 --> 00:21:40.399
that makes a lady cry.

00:21:40.433 --> 00:21:43.138
Instead, you get my
Diable Jambe!

00:21:44.775 --> 00:21:46.979

[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B yells]

00:21:54.962 --> 00:21:56.197
You see?

00:21:56.231 --> 00:22:01.074
When you stand in the way
of love... I put my foot down.

00:22:01.107 --> 00:22:03.880
[VIOLET]
Oh Sanji! I was so scared!

00:22:03.913 --> 00:22:07.153
[SANJI] It's all over.
You're not hurt, are you?

00:22:07.186 --> 00:22:08.756
[VIOLET]
No! Thanks to you!

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.363
[SANJI gasps]
Ahem. Good to hear.

00:22:13.432 --> 00:22:14.635
[VIOLET]
Listen, Sanji.

00:22:14.668 --> 00:22:15.803
[SANJI]
Hm?

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.714
[VIOLET] If I could...
ask just one more favor.

00:22:20.748 --> 00:22:22.885
[gasps]
Only one?

00:22:22.918 --> 00:22:25.456
I thought you would
have learned by now.

00:22:25.489 --> 00:22:28.663
I'd do anything for you!

00:22:28.696 --> 00:22:31.535
[VIOLET chuckles]
That's good.

00:22:32.671 --> 00:22:33.839
[SANJI]
Mm?

00:22:36.444 --> 00:22:39.116
[VIOLET]
Then here is my final request.

00:22:41.187 --> 00:22:43.291
You must give your life to me.

00:22:43.325 --> 00:22:45.864
Every last drop
of it, "Black Leg".

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:50.873
Whoa. Let's back up here.
I mean, what're you saying?

00:22:52.043 --> 00:22:56.351
[VIOLET chuckels]
You really are a fool.

00:23:04.233 --> 00:23:06.237
[VIOLET chuckles]

00:23:15.223 --> 00:23:18.328
[NARRATOR] Sanji is devastated
to learn Violet's true colors.

00:23:18.362 --> 00:23:21.234
Elsewhere, Usopp and Robin
part ways with Law

00:23:21.267 --> 00:23:23.138
and begin to explore Green Bit.

00:23:23.171 --> 00:23:25.878
As the two investigate the
forest of giant plants,

00:23:25.911 --> 00:23:27.681
they come close to
discovering the secret

00:23:27.714 --> 00:23:30.553
of Dressrosa's
legendary fairies!

00:23:30.587 --> 00:23:32.056
