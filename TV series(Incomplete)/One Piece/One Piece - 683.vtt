00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.946
[cackles]

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.818
My darkness will
swallow the world,

00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:34.088
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:35.992
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:38.096
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:42.505
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:37.649
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.683 --> 00:02:40.555
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.588 --> 00:02:45.798
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:48.370
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:51.610
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:53.514
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:56.019
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:58.857
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:03.333
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:04.869
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:08.644
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:12.952
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:16.392
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:18.430
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.463 --> 00:03:20.634
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:23.339
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.372 --> 00:03:25.612
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:28.249
Usopp freed citizens
who had been enslaved

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:30.120
and transformed into toys,

00:03:30.154 --> 00:03:32.258
prompting Doflamingo to
trap the entire kingdom

00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.295
inside a barrier known
as the "Birdcage"

00:03:34.328 --> 00:03:37.168
and place bounties
on Luffy and his allies.

00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:40.107
You have little time
for indecisiveness.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.375
The longer this takes,

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.650
the more people fall,
the more buildings burn.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:51.162
Either you kill me, or you take
out the 12 targeted criminals.

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:55.070
Now, let the games begin!

00:03:55.104 --> 00:03:56.774
Maybe you need a reminder?

00:03:56.807 --> 00:03:59.011
We were supposed to
destroy the factory

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:03.888
in order to provoke a conflict
between Kaido and Doflamingo.

00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:05.291
Did it ever cross your mind

00:04:05.324 --> 00:04:07.796
that if we prematurely
kill that bastard,

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.469
it'll only cause Kaido to
redirect his anger at us?

00:04:11.504 --> 00:04:15.878
Is that what you really want?
To take on a pissed off Emperor?

00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:19.986
Things don't always
work out. We have to.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.857
Did you even think
of the kingdom?

00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:24.562
If we chicken out now,
what'll happen to it?

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:29.138
Well, Admiral. What's the plan?
Get Doflamingo?

00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:33.346
These people need our help.
We'll restrain the rowdy ones.

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:37.555
After that, we'll set our sights
on Straw Hat and Law.

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:38.290
Huh?

00:04:38.323 --> 00:04:40.427
You heard me. Tell our men.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.634
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:44.503

[TOWNSPEOPLE groaning]

00:04:47.575 --> 00:04:49.278
[FUJITORA]
Shut it down.

00:04:49.311 --> 00:04:51.015
[TOWNSPEOPLE murmuring]

00:04:51.048 --> 00:04:52.351
[FUJITORA]
He who shoots often

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:56.826
may sometimes hit at last,
but not in this case.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.970
The Navy Admiral.

00:05:02.003 --> 00:05:03.874
[LAW gasping]

00:05:03.908 --> 00:05:06.478
It's the gambling old guy!

00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:11.288
[LUFFY]
"With a Rumbling of the Ground!

00:05:11.322 --> 00:05:15.598
The God of Destruction -

00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:29.959
[DELLINGER]
Hmm...

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:51.169
I'm about to go kick
Doflamingo's sorry ass.

00:05:51.202 --> 00:05:52.905
You're in my way!

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:57.815
That's quite a mouth on you,
Straw Hat. However...

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.926
It'll take more than
words to shake me.

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:04.495
You wanna fight?

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.734
I don't suppose you'd back down?

00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:08.102
[LAW grunts]

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:23.165
[LUFFY yelling]

00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:26.640
[LUFFY grunting]

00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:39.766
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Doflamingo!

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.670
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A panting]
Straw Hat Luffy

00:06:41.704 --> 00:06:43.039
is getting ready to
fight the Marines!

00:06:43.072 --> 00:06:45.678
He's gonna get his ass
whooped hard by Fujitora!

00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:51.724
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]
Oh, yeah? Let them have fun.

00:06:51.757 --> 00:06:54.094
[PICA]
You sure that's what you want?

00:06:54.128 --> 00:06:55.363
[ALL gasp]

00:06:55.396 --> 00:06:57.467
[PICA]
Why don't you let me at them?

00:06:57.501 --> 00:06:58.537
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
His voice!

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.373
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE C]
Oh my god.

00:07:00.406 --> 00:07:03.914
I'll thrash them all by myself!

00:07:10.493 --> 00:07:12.899
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
He's so shrill!

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:14.602
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE G]
Why does such a huge dude

00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:16.172
have such a squeaky voice?

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:18.176
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE H]
It always catches me off guard

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:20.347
no matter how many
times I hear it!

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.850
I'm gonna crack up
one of these times

00:07:21.883 --> 00:07:24.221
and he's gonna put me
through a wall!

00:07:24.254 --> 00:07:27.428
[DOFLAMINGO] Heh. There's no
need to rush things, Pica.

00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:29.932
Just wait. Patience is key.

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:33.640
You could consider this
to be an election of sorts.

00:07:33.674 --> 00:07:36.445
I humbly asked the
kingdom of Dressrosa

00:07:36.478 --> 00:07:38.718
who is more fit
to be their ruler:

00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:42.090
The Riku Family?
Or the Don Quixote Family?

00:07:42.124 --> 00:07:44.562
It's the people's right
to choose their king.

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:47.167
It's only fair, after all.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.038
But that's boring!

00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:50.440
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE D]
Now's not the time!

00:07:50.474 --> 00:07:51.910
Do you have a death wish?

00:07:51.944 --> 00:07:55.784
We should just exterminate
the pests and be done with it.

00:07:55.818 --> 00:07:58.957
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE D] You
really gotta keep it in, man!

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.995
[DOFLAMINGO] We only need
to stomp out the ones

00:08:01.028 --> 00:08:02.698
who directly oppose us.

00:08:02.731 --> 00:08:06.306
We can sit back and watch
the rest devour one another.

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:07.908
But Doffy! I'd rather--

00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:08.811
[laughing]

00:08:08.844 --> 00:08:10.614
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasping]

00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:14.589
I'm so sorry Master Pica!

00:08:14.623 --> 00:08:17.294
Forgive him!
He's new around here!

00:08:17.327 --> 00:08:19.231
He wasn't prepared to hear you.

00:08:19.264 --> 00:08:20.868
Sorry! Sorry!

00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:25.410
[PICA] Buried forever. You'll be
entombed in a sea of stones!

00:08:25.444 --> 00:08:26.547
[gasping]

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.487
[BABY 5]
Wait, Lord Pica! Armsmorphosis!

00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:32.758
Gatling Girl!

00:08:38.369 --> 00:08:42.277
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES murmur]

00:08:42.311 --> 00:08:43.547
If you're gonna kill him,

00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:47.053
you can at least leave
a body for his family.

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:51.328
I mean, we're not evil, right?

00:08:51.362 --> 00:08:54.334
That's a good point.
Thanks, Baby 5!

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:58.242
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE I screams]

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:15.377
[DOFLAMINGO]
You.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.913
Y-Yes, sir!

00:09:16.947 --> 00:09:18.382
[DOFLAMINGO]
Do you have a family?

00:09:18.415 --> 00:09:20.821
Uh. Yeah, I do.

00:09:20.854 --> 00:09:21.957
[DOFLAMINGO]
What about you?

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.762
Me? Yes! I do.

00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:29.505
[DOFLAMINGO] I lost my mother
at the tender age of eight,

00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:32.143
and killed my father
when I was ten.

00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:34.214
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:40.026
[DOFLAMINGO] The members who
hold ranks as Executives

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.799
are whom I consider
my closest family.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.772
I've been through thick
and thin with them.

00:09:45.805 --> 00:09:48.309
They are all that I've
got in this world.

00:09:48.343 --> 00:09:52.484
To make jest of any of them
is absolutely unforgivable.

00:09:52.518 --> 00:09:53.620
Am I clear?

00:09:53.654 --> 00:09:56.158
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Y-Yes, sir!

00:09:57.461 --> 00:10:00.834
[PIRATE A] I heard the Five-star
Usopp is somewhere around here!

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:02.404
Start searchin'! This way!

00:10:02.437 --> 00:10:03.641
[PIRATES yelling]

00:10:03.674 --> 00:10:06.178
[PIRATE B]
Kill him!

00:10:11.489 --> 00:10:13.459
Why do they want me?

00:10:13.492 --> 00:10:17.467
Because the mighty Usoland is a
man worth 500 million berries!

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.970
Who wouldn't want a piece'a him?

00:10:19.004 --> 00:10:21.744
A legend like you would have
a giant bounty, right?

00:10:21.777 --> 00:10:23.547
[USOPP] It's not something
to be proud of!

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:26.352
I mean... Such is
the life of a hero.

00:10:26.385 --> 00:10:30.260
Who could resist chasing after
a true champion like me?

00:10:30.293 --> 00:10:31.462
Can't blame 'em.

00:10:31.495 --> 00:10:32.765
[BOTH]
He is so cool!

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:35.270
[DWARVES]
Hooray! You saved the day!

00:10:35.303 --> 00:10:36.907
Come on you guys.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.977
[ROBIN] Stop fooling around,
we have to hurry.

00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:42.818
Hey, Robin. How do we
make our way to Lucy?

00:10:42.852 --> 00:10:44.890
[ROBIN] Look up. Because
of the terrain shift,

00:10:44.923 --> 00:10:47.829
the coliseum wall is now
connected to the King's Plateau.

00:10:47.862 --> 00:10:49.464
Let's take advantage of that.

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:50.801
We should find him
somewhere up there.

00:10:50.834 --> 00:10:51.837
[PIRATES yelling]

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.305
[PIRATE C]
There they are!

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:55.878
Is it just me or are there a
whole bunch more of 'em now?

00:10:55.911 --> 00:11:01.221
[HACK] Heh. Fine by me! Let me
show you how to clean house.

00:11:01.255 --> 00:11:02.090
[REBECCA]
Hack?

00:11:02.123 --> 00:11:03.426
[HACK]
Leave these vermin to me.

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:05.096
Move it, old guy!

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.102
You money-blinded fools
have no self-respect!

00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:10.841
You've reduced yourselves
to Doflamingo's lap dogs.

00:11:10.874 --> 00:11:12.512
[PIRATES yelling]

00:11:12.545 --> 00:11:14.749

00:11:35.022 --> 00:11:37.929
Oh! Hearing my name
coming from Miss Robin's

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:40.433
celestial lips
gives me such a rush!

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:42.538
I could die!

00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:44.676
Now! Go with Mr. Sniper King.

00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:46.579
I'll hold off the enemy.

00:11:46.613 --> 00:11:47.849
Thank you!

00:11:47.882 --> 00:11:52.023
Ohh! She thanked a
worthless grub like me!

00:11:52.056 --> 00:11:55.464
I'm so fired up! Ain't no
one gonna get through!

Come on!

[LUFFY]
You're in my way! Move!

00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:17.473
[ZORO] He's usin' that
weird technique again!

00:12:23.252 --> 00:12:24.755
[ZORO grunting]

00:12:45.698 --> 00:12:47.601
[DELLINGER]
Boo! Mr. Marine's

00:12:47.634 --> 00:12:49.371
gonna hog all the
fun to himself.

00:12:49.404 --> 00:12:52.878
Let's go check in on what
the Young Master's do-een.

00:12:52.912 --> 00:12:56.720
Yeah, fine. Hey, where
did Señor run off to?

00:12:56.753 --> 00:12:58.356
There's still a
score to eve-een.

00:12:58.389 --> 00:13:01.663
Knowing how hard-boiled that man
is, he's probably looking to

00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:04.802
wrap up that cybernetic
pervert's beat-een.

00:13:04.836 --> 00:13:07.140
Having a hard-boiled
face off, huh?

00:13:07.173 --> 00:13:11.348
[FRANKY yells]

00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:14.054
[FRANKY] Hang in there,
Little People! I'm comin'!

00:13:14.087 --> 00:13:16.693
I'm gonna super tear up
that SMILE factory

00:13:16.726 --> 00:13:19.297
and free every last one of ya!

00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:23.740
[USOPP]
We made it! But now what?

00:13:23.774 --> 00:13:27.548
[LEO] How are we ever
gonna climb up there?

00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:31.088
[FLAPPER gasping]

00:13:31.122 --> 00:13:32.592
Allow me.

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:35.831
Cien Fleurs!

00:13:35.864 --> 00:13:38.168

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:53.734
[LEO, FLAPPER]
She is so cool!

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:56.105
[DWARVES]
Hooray! You saved the day!

00:13:56.138 --> 00:13:58.611
Please stop doing that to me.

00:13:58.644 --> 00:13:59.912
[ROBIN]
Leo, lead the way.

00:13:59.946 --> 00:14:01.248
[LEO]
On it!

00:14:01.282 --> 00:14:06.826
Hey, Bartolomeo! Hack!
Look! We found a way up!

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.131
Let's go.

00:14:09.164 --> 00:14:11.034
To think Mister Luffy
and Mister Zoro

00:14:11.068 --> 00:14:12.504
are up there in the flesh!

00:14:12.538 --> 00:14:17.380
Wait for me! Imma coming!
Everything's comin' up roses!

00:14:23.226 --> 00:14:27.200
[VIOLET] The key to Law's cuffs
should be somewhere around here.

00:14:31.275 --> 00:14:32.545
There it is!

00:14:32.578 --> 00:14:37.789
[VIOLET gasping]

00:14:37.822 --> 00:14:40.694
Good news, Father!
Rebecca is down there!

00:14:40.727 --> 00:14:41.963
She's what?

00:14:41.997 --> 00:14:45.002
[PIRATE E] She's one of
the bounties! Grab her!

00:14:45.035 --> 00:14:45.938
[REBECCA gasps]

00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:48.008
[PIRATES yelling]

00:14:48.042 --> 00:14:50.881
[TANK]
Back off!

00:14:50.914 --> 00:14:53.754
[PIRATES groaning]

00:14:53.787 --> 00:14:55.657
It can't be!

00:14:57.595 --> 00:14:59.666
[REBECCA]
Tank!

00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:01.235
[TANK]
Lady Rebecca!

00:15:01.268 --> 00:15:07.347
I promise to protect you
with everything that I've got!

00:15:07.381 --> 00:15:09.017
Huh?

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.590
Oh! Is that you there,
Captain Tank?

00:15:11.623 --> 00:15:14.929
[gasps] It's King Riku!

00:15:15.731 --> 00:15:18.537
I'm glad you're alive!

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.173
Grandfather!

00:15:20.206 --> 00:15:21.610
Rebecca!

00:15:21.643 --> 00:15:24.047
[REBECCA gasping]

00:15:28.455 --> 00:15:31.829
[KYROS] Please await my arrival
just a bit longer, everyone!

00:15:31.863 --> 00:15:36.004
I'm going to take back our
Dressrosa, no matter the cost!

00:15:55.276 --> 00:15:57.882
[grunting]

00:15:57.915 --> 00:15:59.919
[TOWNSMAN A]
A-Are you okay?

00:15:59.952 --> 00:16:02.891
[KIN'EMON]
Just splendid.

00:16:02.925 --> 00:16:05.196
Is this, by chance,
the junkyard?

00:16:05.229 --> 00:16:06.666
[TOWNSMAN A]
Indeed, it is.

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:10.106
Ah yes, explains the surplus
of waste scattered about.

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:13.078
Hey, so what exactly
is going on up there?

00:16:13.112 --> 00:16:15.551
Truthfully, I'm not
too sure myself.

00:16:15.584 --> 00:16:18.557
Have you people perhaps
run into a samurai

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.193
by the name of Kanjuro?

00:16:20.226 --> 00:16:21.394
[TOWNSMAN A]
Kanjuro?

00:16:21.428 --> 00:16:26.004
--[rumbling]

[USOPP whimpers]

00:16:34.589 --> 00:16:35.456
What is it?

00:16:35.489 --> 00:16:36.458
Ugh, what now?

00:16:36.491 --> 00:16:38.262
The ground!

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:42.538
Just what are they
attempting to do?

00:16:55.631 --> 00:16:57.768
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:17:03.178 --> 00:17:05.917
Huh? Not again!

[screams]

00:17:17.306 --> 00:17:21.448
Uh! Ah! What the
hell's happening?!

00:17:26.425 --> 00:17:27.528
[screams]

00:17:27.561 --> 00:17:28.897
No. It can't be!

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:34.541
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:17:36.679 --> 00:17:37.814
[ZORO grunts]

[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:44.314
It can't be...

00:18:44.347 --> 00:18:47.655
They're getting serious now!

00:18:47.688 --> 00:18:51.028
No use even fighting
back against that guy.

00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:54.267
Yeah, those pirates are dead.

00:19:10.634 --> 00:19:11.636

[LUFFY]
What the hell is that?

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.734
[TOWNSMAN H]
A giant man!

00:19:27.768 --> 00:19:29.705
[TOWNSMAN I]
He's huge!

00:19:29.738 --> 00:19:31.041
The wall guy?

00:19:31.074 --> 00:19:33.045
Pica!

[LUFFY gasping]

00:19:48.577 --> 00:19:53.418
[PICA] Any fool who opposes our
Family will be answering to me.

00:19:53.452 --> 00:19:54.655
[LUFFY, ZORO laugh]

00:19:54.689 --> 00:19:57.994
[PICA]
Now, step forward and fight!

00:19:59.264 --> 00:20:04.241
[LUFFY laughs]
His voice... is so high!

00:20:04.274 --> 00:20:11.054
[laughing] It's funny!

Shh!

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:17.768
How does that even work?!

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:23.913
[LUFFY laughs]

00:20:23.946 --> 00:20:26.384
[LUFFY]
Say something else!

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:34.233
[PICA]
Straw Hat!

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:37.608
Okay, stop!
I can't take anymore!

[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE P] Are you
crazy? You're gonna pay!

00:20:43.653 --> 00:20:45.757
His voice is a real
sensitive issue!

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.162
Knock it off or he's gonna
flip out and kill us, too!

What happens next falls
on your shoulders, pal!

00:20:58.517 --> 00:21:01.421
[LUFFY] How can you guys keep
a straight face when he talks?

00:21:01.454 --> 00:21:05.563
We just do! We don't wanna die!

Run for it!

[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE S] Brace
yourselves! 'Cause we're about

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:35.557
to get punched by a
whole freakin' castle!

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.529
[DELLINGER]
Ahh! Have mercy on us, Pica!

00:21:38.562 --> 00:21:41.201
Our best chance to survive
this will be in the palace!

00:21:41.234 --> 00:21:42.337
Keep run-iiin!

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.709
Being chased gives
me such a thrill!

00:21:44.742 --> 00:21:47.413
I can feel that there's
trouble looming.

00:21:47.446 --> 00:21:51.856
Admiral, a monster is coming!
We have to take cover!

00:21:51.889 --> 00:21:55.196
Luffy! You really gotta stop
screwing with every enemy.

00:21:55.229 --> 00:21:56.799
[PICA]
You'll never escape!

00:21:56.833 --> 00:21:57.802
[ZORO]
Pfft!

00:21:57.835 --> 00:22:00.874
See! It's so hard
not to crack up, huh?

Damn, you two.

[NARRATOR]
The colossal Pica

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.095
comes down hard on
Luffy and the island.

00:23:18.128 --> 00:23:20.733
Accidently provoking the
wrath of the massive foe,

00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:23.906
Luffy stands up to a level of
danger he's never faced before.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.044
Now, former enemies
become allies

00:23:26.078 --> 00:23:27.280
to bring down the behemoth

00:23:27.313 --> 00:23:29.450
before setting their
sights on Doflamingo!

00:23:29.484 --> 00:23:30.887

On the next One Piece!

King of the Pirates!
