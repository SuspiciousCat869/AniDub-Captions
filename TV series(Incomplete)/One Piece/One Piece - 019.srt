00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,667
[INSTRUCTOR]
Kuina!

174
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,004
[DOJO MASTER] It's not polite
to eavesdrop, my dear.

175
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:36,672
I'll show you I can do it!

176
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:39,633
I will become the world's
greatest swordsman!

177
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:46,390
[DOJO MASTER]
Kuina. As a girl...

178
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:49,727
you can never become the
world's greatest swordsman.

179
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,021
[KUINA gasping]

180
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:03,032
[ZORO panting]

181
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:11,665
[KUINA]
Zoro?

182
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:14,585
It's late out.
What are you doing?

183
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:17,588
Funny. I was gonna ask
you the same question.

184
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:19,715
What are you doing out so late?

185
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,927
I've come here
to challenge you

186
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,179
to your two thousand
and first fight.

187
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,849
And it's gonna be the last fight
you and me will ever have.

188
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:30,559
This ends tonight.

189
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,770
Fight me with a real sword!

190
00:10:32,853 --> 00:10:35,105
You do have one, don't you?

191
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:38,692
Real swords...?

192
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:45,074
You're on.

193
00:10:58,128 --> 00:11:03,175
The Wado... Ichimonji.

194
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,543
[ZORO grunts]

195
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:39,712
[ZORO yells]

196
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:40,921
[BOTH yell]

197
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:43,215
[ZORO yells]

198
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:52,891
[ZORO yells]

199
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:53,851
[KUINA yells]

200
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:57,354
[ZORO, KUINA grunting]

201
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,567

[ZORO pants]

204
00:12:12,536 --> 00:12:15,873
[KUINA] Two real swords are
heavier than you thought, huh?

205
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:18,625
See. You still lack strength.

206
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:21,045
[ZORO growls]
Shut up!

207
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:24,757
[ZORO screams]

208
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:27,468
[KUINA]
Ah!

209
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:36,143
Win number 2,001.

210
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:42,816
[ZORO cries]

211
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:46,737
[ZORO]
Damn it!

212
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:51,575
This sucks... I... I hate it!

213
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:54,745
[ZORO cries]

214
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:57,623
[KUINA] I'm the one who should
be crying out of frustration.

215
00:12:57,664 --> 00:12:59,792
Not you.

216
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:05,089
When girls grow up, its
natural for us to develop

217
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,175
into physically weaker
beings than men.

218
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:12,262
Even you will catch up
to me soon enough.

219
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:14,515
I've always heard
you say to me

220
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:17,684
you're gonna be the world's
greatest swordsman.

221
00:13:17,768 --> 00:13:20,854
When I told my father
the same thing,

222
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:24,024
he said I could never be that.

223
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:27,152
And I know. I know that. But...

224
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:29,613
It's just so frustrating.

225
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:35,035
You're lucky Zoro,
being born as a man.

226
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:39,123
All I ever wanted was to be the
world's greatest swordsman.

227
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:43,127
My breasts have even started to
grow out now. If only...

228
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:46,046
If I had just been born a man!

229
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,214
[ZORO growls]

230
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:48,674
[ZORO]
Don't fly off at the mouth,

231
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:51,009
whining like that
after you beat me!

232
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:53,303
Because it's not fair!
You're my goal!

233
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:54,888
You know how this
makes me feel?!

234
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:56,014
Zoro...

235
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:58,058
[ZORO] Boy this, girl that.
Are you gonna keep up

236
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:00,894
that same kinda talk after
I beat you some day?

237
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:04,189
Like skill is irrelevant!
That's just an insult to all

238
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:07,151
of the training I've been
pouring on every day.

239
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:11,238
So don't say that
crap, would ya?!

240
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:13,240
Now promise me...

241
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:15,826
Promise me that someday
one of us will be

242
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:17,870
the world's greatest swordsman.

243
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:20,706
We'll compete and
see who gets there.

244
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:29,256
Dummy. You're so weak.

245
00:14:32,676 --> 00:14:34,678
[KUINA, ZORO]
It's a promise.

246
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:40,017
[KUINA screams]

247
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:41,852
[INSTRUCTOR, KUINA grunting]

248
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:43,854
[STUDENTS gasping]

249
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:44,938
Whoa.

250
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:48,275
[STUDENT A] She's gotten
even stronger than before.

251
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,198
[ZORO grunting]

252
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:58,076
[ZORO] I gotta get stronger
so I can hold lots of swords.

253
00:14:58,118 --> 00:15:01,371
If two's not enough,
I'll use three.

254
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:09,129
[ZORO]
What do you guys want?

255
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:10,631
[ZORO]
Huh?

256
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:13,133
[STUDENT A]
Kunia...

257
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:16,595
Kuina is dead, Zoro.

258
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:28,815
[MAN A]
They said she slipped

259
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,817
and fell down the
storehouse steps.

260
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:32,069
[MAN B]
Storehouse?

261
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,405
[MAN A] Looking for a sharpening
stone for her beloved sword.

262
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:37,241
[MAN B] What would
she need that for?

263
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:38,408
[MAN A]
I don't know.

264
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:40,619
[MAN B]
She was just a child, too.

265
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:42,829
[MAN A] Who knows why
anyone does anything.

266
00:15:42,913 --> 00:15:45,290
There's no way to
rationalize it.

267
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:47,084
[MAN B] Guess ya never
know what's waiting for you

268
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,127
around the next corner.

269
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,175
[ZORO panting]

270
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:01,306
[panting continues]

[ZORO screams]

275
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:05,996
[ZORO panting]

276
00:17:19,343 --> 00:17:22,095
[DOJO MASTER] It may appear
otherwise to the blind eye,

277
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:26,183
but people are quite
fragile things.

278
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:30,187
Kuina... She was a
very competitive girl.

279
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:34,107
From the time she was old enough
to make a decision for herself,

280
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:36,401
she practiced in this Dojo,

281
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:39,905
achieving strength that
surpassed many adults.

282
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:41,782
It was this fruition of power

283
00:17:41,865 --> 00:17:44,868
that caused her to
become a bit conceited.

284
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:49,247
And then you appeared, Zoro.
And I thank you for this.

285
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:51,375
Because as you
grew ever stronger,

286
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,419
Kuina felt compelled
to practice even more.

287
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:59,091
So as not to lose to you.
So as not to lose to a boy.

288
00:17:59,132 --> 00:18:01,134
Through this, she had
begun to chip away

289
00:18:01,134 --> 00:18:04,763
at the walls of female
swordsmanship.

290
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:09,059
Despite any of which I speak,
I am, above all other things,

291
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,103
an ordinary parent.

292
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:12,813
And as any human,

293
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:17,401
I am bound by my emotions
as well as my blood.

294
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:22,447
When I look at you now,
Zoro, I... feel only pain.

295
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:28,245
[ZORO whimpers]

296
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:37,963
[ZORO]
Sensei...

297
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:41,425
I ask that you let
me have that sword.

298
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:46,096
[DOJO MASTER]
Kuina's sword?

299
00:18:46,096 --> 00:18:47,431
[ZORO]
I'll get stronger!

300
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:50,142
Stronger than she ever
was, you hear me?!

301
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:54,354
Strong enough that my name
reaches up to the Heavens!

302
00:18:54,438 --> 00:18:59,359
I am going to be the world's
greatest swordsman!

303
00:18:59,443 --> 00:19:03,613
I promised her. I promised...

304
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:05,991
I did...

305
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:14,374
[DOJO MASTER]
Yes. The sword is yours.

306
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:19,212
[ZORO gasps]

307
00:19:19,212 --> 00:19:24,509
I leave her spirit and her
dreams in your hands.

308
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:27,637
[ZORO whimpers]

309

[ZORO wails]

310
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:11,723
It's been eight years, Zoro.

311
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:15,227
You're finally going to
set out on your own?

312
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:16,895
[ZORO]
Yes, Sensei.

313
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:19,523
To fulfill...

314
00:20:19,564 --> 00:20:20,899
a promise.

315
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:22,692
[DOJO MASTER]
Mm.

316
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:34,621
Zoro!

317
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:39,417
[DOJO MASTER]
Take care.

318
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:46,883
[LUFFY]
That was way off the mark!

319
00:20:46,925 --> 00:20:47,592
[ZORO grunts]

320
00:20:47,592 --> 00:20:49,386
Hey, What's so loud down there?

321
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:53,473
Cannon firing practice!
But it's not going very well.

322
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:57,269
Like I said... Let the
expert aim the thing.

323
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,604
Judging from the flying
distance of the last one,

324
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:00,939
this should do it.

325
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:02,774
Fire!

326
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:06,611
[LUFFY] Awesome! You hit
that thing on the first try!

327
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:08,613
[USOPP]
Wow, I did.

328
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:10,615
Whatcha think? I'm
pretty magnificent

329
00:21:10,657 --> 00:21:12,784
when it comes to aiming!
So, are you impressed yet?!

330
00:21:12,826 --> 00:21:14,494
Yeah! You better believe it!

331
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:16,788
So it's all settled.
You'll be our sniper.

332
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:18,623
[USOPP]
Wait, I don't get to be captain?

333
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:20,333
[LUFFY]
No. I'm still the captain!

334
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,793
‐‐[ZORO chuckles]
‐‐[USOPP laughs]

335
00:21:21,793 --> 00:21:24,963
[USOPP] Whatever. I'll
humor you for now, but...

336
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:27,841
the second you do something
cowardly, I'm taking your post!

337
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:30,844
I can live with that. But, you
know guys, I was thinking.

338
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:33,346
There's one other position
that we have to fill

339
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:35,348
before we can head out
for the Grand Line.

340
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:37,976
You're right. The kitchen
is really nice on this ship.

341
00:21:37,976 --> 00:21:39,853
Just... pay me, and I'll do it.

342
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:41,980
[ZORO] I suppose it is
vital for long trips.

343
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,983
[LUFFY] No decent pirate ship
should be without one.

344
00:21:44,983 --> 00:21:46,443
A musician.

345
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:47,819
[ZORO]
