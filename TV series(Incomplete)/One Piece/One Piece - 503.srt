1
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,056
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,793
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,360
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,363
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:44,898
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,701
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,369
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,305
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,175
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,811
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,345
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,748
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,118
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,555
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,725
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,429
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,869
[NARRATOR] Amidst the fire
overtaking Gray Terminal,

18
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,204
Ace and Dadan faced Bluejam

19
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,608
while an injured Luffy was
taken back to Mt. Corvo.

20
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:31,211
Elsewhere, the Goa Kingdom
welcomed a Celestial Dragon.

21
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:33,714
However, the World Noble
was displeased to see

22
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,983
Sabo's ship in his
path, and opened fire.

23
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,458
[LUFFY] "Take Good Care of Him!
A Letter From the Brother!"

24
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,065
Get outta my way,
I gotta find Ace!

25
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,099
[MAGRA]
Easy, Luffy, easy!

26
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:56,103
I know how you feel,
but it's still too dangerous.

27
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,771
You got banged up pretty bad,

28
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,140
and the place is
crawling with soldiers!

29
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:01,074
[LUFFY]
Who cares?

30
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,310
Please calm down
and listen to me!

31
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,312
We get it.

32
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,482
We're scared, too, but right
now we just need to have faith

33
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,884
that the boss and Ace
are still alive.

34
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,254
Dogra went back to look
for 'em, so be patient!

35
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,590
Understand?

36
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,859
This is hard on everyone, okay?

37
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,065
[NOBLE E]
The fishing boat has been hit!

38
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,400
What happened to the child?

39
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:29,469
That kid shouldn't have gotten
in the Celestial Dragon's way!

40
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,904
Get outta there!

41
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,873
[SABO grunts]
Damn!

42
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,741
[grunting]

43
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,110
Why'd he shoot at me? [gasps]

44
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,813
[SUBORDINATE C] Saint Jalmack!
Th-There's a child on that ship!

45
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,650
[JALMACK] Anyone who flies a
black flag is a filthy pirate!

46
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,652
His age is irrelevant.

47
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,087
He must pay.

48
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,087
[SUBORDINATE C gasps]

49
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,189
[SABO grunting]

50
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,391
[gasps]

51
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,459
[SABO]
Come on!

52
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,461
A commoner should know better.

53
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,998
Don't cross my ship,
you stupid pirate brat!

54
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,733
[SABO gasps]

55
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,751
[CROWD gasping]

56
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,153
What? Why would they fire
on that ship a second time?

57
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,321
[NOBLE D]
Who cares! We don't want

58
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,823
to make the
Celestial Dragon mad!

59
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:26,193
This is an important ceremony,
let him do whatever he wants!

60
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,962
[NOBLE F]
Ugh! Clear the wreckage already!

61
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,985
[BANDIT A panting]

62
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,452
[BANDIT A]
Hey!

63
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,954
I-I got news.

64
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:54,988
Ace and the boss are...

65
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,457
--[BANDITS gasp]
--What is it?

66
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,593
They came back!
They both made it!

67
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,195
[LUFFY, BANDITS gasp]

68
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,631
[LUFFY panting]

69
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,636
[LUFFY, BANDITS gasping]

70
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:14,708
[ACE panting]

71
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,380
[DADAN panting]

72
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,849
[BANDITS laughing, chattering]

73
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,819
I was... so scared.

74
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,487
[BANDIT E]
She's badly wounded!

75
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,557
Get them both
inside, now! Hurry!

76
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,660
[MAGRA]
Hang in there, Boss.

77
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,663
[LUFFY crying]

78
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,265
--[ACE gasps]
--Ace!

79
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:39,233
Get off!

80
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,669
[LUFFY whimpering]

81
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,972
C'mon. Did you seriously
think I was dead?

82
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:45,739
Maybe!

83
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,874
[ACE]
Quit crying already!

84
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,542
[LUFFY yelps]

85
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,710
I'm standing right
in front of ya, dummy!

86
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,114
C'mon, Ace! Take it easy
on the kiddo for once.

87
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,449
Luffy's just happy to see you.

88
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,253
[sighs]

89
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,024
[BANDIT B] What happened
the night of the fire?

90
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:05,559
We all came back
here with Luffy,

91
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,327
so we haven't heard a word.

92
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,896
Can you tell us everything that
happened to you and the boss?

93
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,664
Oh.

94
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,534
Well, um, we fought Bluejam.

95
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,335
[groans]

96
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,171
--[BLUEJAM yells]
--[DADAN yells]

97
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,138
[BLUEJAM]
Huh?

98
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,010
--[DADAN gasps]
--[BLUEJAM chuckles]

99
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,279
[gasps, groans]

100
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,880
[DADAN yells]

101
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,684
[ACE grunts]

102
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:31,652
[BLUEJAM groans, gasps]

103
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,654
[DADAN grunts, yells]

104
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,493
[panting]

105
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,596
[ACE]
We barely defeated him.

106
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,701
[ACE] And we tried
to catch up to you guys

107
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:52,206
as fast as we could, but the
fire was blocking our way.

108
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,273
Damn it all!

109
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,775
I can hardly
breathe in this mess!

110
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,444
We've got no choice but
to run through the flames!

111
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:58,412
[DADAN]
Wait!

112
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,947
What the hell are you doing?

113
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,315
Now, listen up.

114
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,117
You're are my responsibility,
whether you like it or not.

115
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,287
No matter what happens,
I'm getting you home!

116
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:11,092
[DADAN]
Stay close and follow my lead.

117
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,293
Don't get separated
from me at any cost!

118
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,095
--Huh?
--[DADAN yells]

119
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,163
[ACE]
Dadan!

120
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:21,201
[yelling]

121
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,973
[DADAN yells]

122
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:26,907
Wh-Whoa!

123
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,210
Hey! Dadan, are you all right?

124
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,145
[ACE]
We made it through the fire.

125
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,483
Dadan was suffering from
some serious burns, though.

126
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,984
Eventually we managed to get

127
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,686
to the riverside in
the In-Between Forest.

128
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,756
[DADAN grunts]

129
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,662
[ACE] Stay with me,
Dadan! You can't die!

130
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,163
[COP A]
Thief!

131
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,300
[COP B]
You can't do that! Stop!

132
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,002
[ACE] I went into
town to steal medicine

133
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,404
and grab whatever
food I could find.

134
00:08:57,438 --> 00:09:01,408
I'm no doctor, but I did what
I could to save Dadan's life.

135
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,945
[DADAN grunts]

136
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:07,915
[panting]

137
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,117
Quit worryin' about me, Ace.

138
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,852
Please, just go.

139
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,020
Cut the crap!

140
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,556
It's your responsibility
to take me home, remember?

141
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,026
And you're still gonna do it,
while I make sure you don't die!

142
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,128
[NOBLE SOLDIER A]
Hear that?

143
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,563
Keep your ears to the ground.

144
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,665
Some survivors could
be lurking around here!

145
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,767
Don't let anyone get
away. Snuff 'em out!

146
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,901
[NOBLE SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

147
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,073
What an ordeal!

148
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:36,310
In any case, all that matters is
that both of you are back safe!

149
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:39,446
I'm sorry. I made you worry.

150
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,783
That fire was huge and they
were hunting down survivors.

151
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,119
Sabo must think
we're dead right now.

152
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:48,956
[CROWD chattering]

153
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,624
[JALMACK]
This kingdom's likely full of

154
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:53,226
lowly plebeians that
will get in my way.

155
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,129
Be on the lookout
for any disruption.

156
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,463
[SUBORDINATES]
Right!

157
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,804
I wonder what Sabo's been up to.

158
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,339
But at least Ace finally
made it back, right?

159
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,309
He even carried
Dadan home with him.

160
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:09,944
[DOG barks]

161
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,479
Ace, when I came for you...

162
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,281
[ACE]
I'm staying.

163
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,349
I won't run!

164
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:19,620
Why did you do that?

165
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:20,687
I don't know.

166
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,823
I can't help but get fired up.

167
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:24,625
I'm afraid if I run,

168
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:29,296
that I might leave something
important behind me, so I fight.

169
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:34,334
Luffy was there,
so I had no choice.

170
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,402
[DADAN grunts]

171
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:38,339
It's tough to explain,
but I think that's why.

172
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:41,408
[sighs]

173
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:45,713
[GARP] Even when he faced a wave
of far more powerful enemies,

174
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:48,115
Roger would never
think of running away.

175
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:51,285
Did that fool have a death wish?
Running away's a strategy, too.

176
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,655
For him it wasn't even
an option. Think about it.

177
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,924
Retreat means leaving
people behind.

178
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,426
If Roger ran he'd be
abandoning his crew,

179
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,028
the people he loved most.

180
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,598
So, when you think about it,
it's not that he "wouldn't run,"

181
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:08,101
rather, he made sure the enemy
couldn't go after his crew.

182
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,803
He always protected them.

183
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,673
He was a different kind of
animal in times like those.

184
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:14,808
He once wrecked a
whole country's army

185
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:18,112
'cause some soldiers decided
to mouth off about his men.

186
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,747
When he was angry,
Roger would get violent.

187
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,983
He was selfish
and short-tempered,

188
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,085
but he wore his heart
on his sleeve.

189
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,521
He was like a boy
that never grew up.

190
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:31,191
For better or worse, his
childhood was a lot like Ace's.

191
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,793
The pain he went
through just made him

192
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,495
hold on tighter
to the ones he loved.

193
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,335
Roger could be
a very reckless man,

194
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,637
but he lived to become
King of the Pirates.

195
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,472
No easy feat.

196
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,975
Despite his flaws and
his bad reputation,

197
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,745
his crew still
trusted him completely.

198
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,246
Sure, I may be a Marine,

199
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,517
but even I can't
help respecting him.

200
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,952
That's why I decided
to take care of Ace.

201
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:02,490
[DADAN gasps] I'm the one
taking care of him, you ass!

202
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:05,058
Do you got somethin'
you wanna say to me?

203
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,561
No, never mind.

204
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:10,297
[DADAN] People all over
the world still hate Roger,

205
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,434
and even though Ace holds
a grudge against him, too,

206
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,470
they really are
"like father, like son."

207
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:20,441
All right!
Wonder who's gonna win!

208
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:22,108
Dogra!

209
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,712
You went to town to look
for Ace and Dadan, right?

210
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,681
Surprise, they came
back home already!

211
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:29,784
Oh. Did they really?

212
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:32,720
That's just great. Perfect.

213
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,955
[ACE]
What? Sabo?

214
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,023
That can't be.

215
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,491
[DADAN, LUFFY gasping]

216
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,059
You're lying to me, dammit!

217
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,994
Why would you even joke
about that kind of thing?

218
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,329
Take it easy!

219
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:44,865
I told you exactly
what I saw, I swear!

220
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:46,099
I know how you feel.

221
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,936
Everything happened so fast
I could hardly believe it!

222
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:52,206
It felt like a nightmare,
but I know that was Sabo.

223
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,540
Shut up!

224
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:55,709
We watched him go back with his
dad to their home in High Town!

225
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:57,945
You can't have seen him
out at sea by himself!

226
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,013
That's right!
Sabo is with his family!

227
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,383
[DOGRA] Bandits like
us know how he feels!

228
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,450
We know what it means

229
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:06,787
to be turned away from
your home, to be free!

230
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,089
Sabo didn't wanna be a noble!

231
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:12,526
If he was truly happy, he
wouldn't have gone out to sea!

232
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,297
And the Sabo I saw wasn't just
sailing away from his family,

233
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,365
he was flying a jolly roger!

234
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,799
[ACE gasps]

235
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,982
[cries] We shouldn't've have
let him go! It's all our fault!

236
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,317
[ACE grunts]

237
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,252
Even if I had parents,
I was still alone.

238
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,255
Sabo!

239
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,824
Why didn't we go into town
and bring him back here?

240
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,392
We're so stupid!

241
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:47,728
Tell me where I can find
the bastard that killed him!

242
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:49,563
I'm gonna beat him
to death with my bare hands!

243
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,298
[DOGRA] You can't
kill a Celestial Dragon,

244
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,099
that's impossible!

245
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,368
[ACE]
I'll make him pay!

246
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,503
Hold on, Ace!

247
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:57,070
[ACE grunts]

248
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,272
Enough of that, you little punk!

249
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:02,042
Get off!

250
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:03,310
You think you're so tough,

251
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,380
when you're really just
a cocky, stubborn little brat!

252
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,348
What can you do
against a World Noble?

253
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,250
You think he's just some thug?

254
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,053
You're just some no-name kid!

255
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,887
You'll die and nobody
will give a crap!

256
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:16,256
Swept under the rug
the very next day!

257
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,926
It was this whole rotten
country that killed Sabo.

258
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,727
This rotten world!

259
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:23,130
What can a scrawny brat
like you do about it?

260
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,431
[ACE grunts]

261
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,666
Your father on the other hand

262
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,468
changed the world
with his death!

263
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,670
When you become a man
as important as him,

264
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,506
then and only then,
can you take revenge!

265
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,809
[ACE grunting]

266
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:36,043
[crying]

267
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,845
[DADAN]
Tie this fool up!

268
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,481
[BANDIT F]
Uh, yes, ma'am!

269
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:44,051
Sabo!

270
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,552
Dammit!

271
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,487
[LUFFY crying]

272
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,688
Shut up, Luffy!

273
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:52,393
Quit crying like a girl,
or else I'll... I'll...

274
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:57,464
[crying]

275
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,522
[door opens]

276
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:25,659
[DADAN] You've come to
your senses now, I hope.

277
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,664
Guys, untie him.

278
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:31,564
[DOGRA, BANDIT D]
Right.

279
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,167
--[MAILBIRD squawks]
--[DOGRA] Huh?

280
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,701
Try to keep your cool, okay?

281
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:35,769
Where's Luffy?

282
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,572
He was crying all night.
Finally fell asleep.

283
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,543
Oh, my gosh! You're not
gonna believe this!

284
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:43,977
--[MAGRA] Huh?
--[DOGRA] We got a letter!

285
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,345
It's from Sabo!

286
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,180
He must have sent it
before he left!

287
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,682
Look, I think it's
really from him!

288
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:51,117
[gasps] Give it.

289
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,953
Don't worry, I won't
head to town.

290
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,388
It's for Luffy and me, isn't it?

291
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:05,899
[SABO] Ace, Luffy, I hope you
guys weren't hurt in the fire.

292
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:09,837
I'm worried about you both, but
something tells me you're okay.

293
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,839
I've got a surprise to tell you.

294
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:16,210
By the time you get this
letter, I'll be long gone.

295
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:19,379
That's right,
I'm heading out to sea.

296
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:20,848
One thing led to another,

297
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:23,483
and I decided to set
out before you two.

298
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,090
[SABO] I don't know
where I'm going yet,

299
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:33,293
but I do know that anywhere
will be better than this place.

300
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,197
And don't worry, I haven't
given up on my dream.

301
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,665
I'm still gonna be a pirate!

302
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:42,102
I got a head start, but I'm sure
you'll catch up in no time.

303
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:45,505
When we meet again,
we'll be unstoppable!

304
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,009
[SABO] We'll have our
reunion on the Grand Line,

305
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:52,379
three pirate captains,
more free than the wind!

306
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,117
[SABO]
By the way, Ace, I'm curious.

307
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,721
Which one of us do you think
is the real "big brother"?

308
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:05,292
Anyway, wherever we sail, we'll
always have our brotherhood.

309
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:06,994
It may sound kinda cheesy,

310
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:10,163
but that bond is what
I treasure most in this world.

311
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:17,371
[SABO] Luffy is still
weak and a crybaby.

312
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,839
Who knows if he'll
ever grow out of that.

313
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,814
[SABO] But he's still
our little brother,

314
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:29,883
so please take good care of him!

315
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:36,657
[ACE sniffling]

316
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,728
[crying]

317
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:57,011
They call this journalism?

318
00:17:57,044 --> 00:18:00,113
The hell do I care do I care
about some World Noble partying?

319
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:04,885
Surprise, surprise,
nobody's covered Sabo yet.

320
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,488
Yeah. I heard his parents
didn't do a thing.

321
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,356
It's iffy. They may be nobles,

322
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,658
but even high-ranking
nobles are powerless

323
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:14,995
against the World Government
and Celestial Dragons.

324
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,164
How's Luffy doing,
is he any better?

325
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,566
[BANDIT G] Well,
he hasn't been eating much.

326
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,869
[BANDIT H] But he still
eats twice as much as we do!

327
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:24,437
[DOGRA] Sabo's death must
have really gotten to him.

328
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,434
[SABO]
Ace, Luffy, listen!

329
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,538
The three of us, we're
gonna leave this country.

330
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:01,107
We're gonna sail the seas
and see the whole world.

331
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:05,445
[ACE] From now on, we're
honest to goodness brothers.

332
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,781
Cheers to that!

333
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:10,150
[LUFFY, ACE, SABO]
Brothers!

334
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,531
[exhales]

335
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:25,865
[LUFFY grunts]

336
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,205
How long you gonna lay
there like a moron?

337
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,874
[LUFFY whimpers]

338
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:36,944
By the way, the treasure we were
keeping in the forest is gone.

339
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:39,446
Someone must have gotten to it.

340
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,116
Survivors from Bluejam's
crew might've taken it,

341
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:43,583
or maybe the military.

342
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:47,454
Either way, there's nothing
we can do at this point.

343
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:51,157
Meh. I don't care about
the treasure, not anymore.

344
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:54,461
I mean, those were pirate
savings I was sharing with Sabo,

345
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,864
and you, too, later on, I guess.

346
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,933
But in the end, he didn't
need money to set sail,

347
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,235
so why should I get
bent out of shape about it?

348
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:05,539
After all, what's the
point in having treasure

349
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,507
if you can't even protect it?

350
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:12,145
[LUFFY sniffs]
Hey, Ace, I...

351
00:20:13,414 --> 00:20:16,116
[LUFFY]
I wanna get stronger!

352
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:22,956
[LUFFY] Stronger and stronger
and stronger and stronger

353
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,760
and stronger and stronger.

354
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,628
Stronger and stronger.

355
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:31,832
Stronger and stronger
and stronger and stronger!

356
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:35,002
I wanna be the strongest
in the world!

357
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:38,171
And then, I'll protect everyone!

358
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:41,007
I won't lose anyone
I care about!

359
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:44,645
[LUFFY]
You gotta make me a promise!

360
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:46,680
I'm begging you.

361
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:49,049
Please don't die, 'kay, Ace?

362
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,784
Cut it out!

363
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:53,653
You ought to be worried
about dying before I do!

364
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:56,323
What, did you forget?
You're a lot weaker than me!

365
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,758
Listen, and you listen up good!

366
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:01,962
I'm never going to die!

367
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:10,070
[ACE] Ya know, Sabo told
me to take care of you,

368
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:14,107
so I promise, I'm not
gonna die, okay? Not ever!

369
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,510
At least not as long as I've
got a wussy little brother

370
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:18,212
who needs me to protect him.

371
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:20,581
Yeah, okay!

372
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,983
Smarts aren't exactly
my strong point,

373
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:27,420
so I still don't really
understand why Sabo was killed.

374
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:31,024
But whoever did it, they
must be opposed to freedom,

375
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:32,292
because they shot him down

376
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,527
before he ever
got a taste of it.

377
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,898
[ACE] But we shared
that same cup of saké

378
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:40,367
with him and we're still alive!

379
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:45,806
Luffy, listen to me, okay?

380
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,677
There's just one way to live
and that's without any regrets.

381
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,212
[LUFFY grunts]

382
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:07,594
[SABO]
Boys from families like mine,

383
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:11,498
once they turn 18, they're
officially registered as nobles.

384
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,700
[ACE]
Hm.

385
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:16,369
That's why I'm leaving.
I gotta be gone before I'm 17.

386
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:23,911
Someday, we're gonna
set sail, just like Sabo.

387
00:22:23,944 --> 00:22:26,147
We're gonna live
the way we wanna live,

388
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,282
more free than anyone else.

389
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:29,549
[LUFFY]
Mm.

390
00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:32,953
[ACE]
But you know what that means.

391
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:35,523
We'll make plenty of
enemies along the way.

392
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:38,426
We're gonna have to fight
Garp someday, I bet.

393
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:40,794
We gotta be willing
to risk everything.

394
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:44,432
Let's go out to sea at 17,
just like Sabo planned.

395
00:22:44,465 --> 00:22:47,500
Then, we'll be pirates!

396
00:23:16,363 --> 00:23:18,098
[NARRATOR]
Luffy and Ace bury their sorrow

397
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:21,702
and grow stronger day after day
as they train to be pirates.

398
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,237
As time marches on,
they soon bid farewell

399
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:27,174
to their childhood home
and take to the sea at last,

400
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:30,944
in hopes of achieving
the dream that Sabo could not.

401
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:32,679
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

402
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:36,083
"To Live Up to the Promise!
Departures of Their Own!"

403
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:38,752
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
