[CROCUS] He's a unique
and magnificent creature...

33
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,785
Inside Laboon's body
beats the heart of a human.

00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,522
[LUFFY]
"A Promise Between Men!

35
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,458
Luffy And The Whale
Vow To Meet Again!"

36
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,165
[CROCUS] All who have seen
Laboon ask the same questions:

37
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:16,069
Why does he continually strike
his body against the Red Line?

38
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,806
Why does he keep howling
at Reverse Mountain?

39
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,077
[CROCUS]
Listen closely,

40
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,181
and I will reveal to you
Laboon's tragic story.

41
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,201
[CROCUS]
One fine sunny day,

42
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,371
while I was fulfilling my duties
as the lighthouse keeper,

43
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:55,408
some good‐natured pirates
came down Reverse Mountain.

44
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:59,412
They were followed by a
baby whale, spry and chipper,

45
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:03,416
whom I would soon come to know
as the one and only, Laboon.

46
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,354
[CROCUS] He is an Island Whale,
one of the largest in the world.

47
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:12,258
They are a rare species
found only in the West Blue.

48
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,561
Laboon had developed
a bond with the pirates,

49
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,263
traveling with them
for much of their journey.

50
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,898
But knowing the dangers
of the Grand Line,

51
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,869
the pirates chose to leave
Laboon behind in the West Blue.

52
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,639
[CROCUS] But the stubborn little
whale followed them anyway.

53
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,576
As a general rule, Island
Whales are social animals,

54
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,278
and travel together
in family groups.

55
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,614
I suspect that Laboon
had somehow come to feel

56
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,550
that those pirates
were his family.

57
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,620
The wear and tear on the
pirates' ship was quite severe,

58
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,889
so they stayed here
for several months.

59
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,624
In that time, I, too, was able

60
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,660
to forge a close
relationship with them.

61
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,297
Thus, when the day of their
departure finally arrived.

62
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,933
[CAPTAIN] I have a favor
to ask of you, my dear friend.

63
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,636
Could you look after
Laboon for a few years?

64
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,271
When my men and I have completed

65
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,807
our voyage around the world,
we'll be back.

66
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,809
[CAPTAIN]
Listen to me, Laboon...

67
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,812
We're taking our ship to
the end of the Grand Line.

68
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,515
Until we return, I need you
to wait for us here with Crocus.

69
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,684
You can't come with us...

70
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,854
It's too dangerous, even
for a mighty whale like you.

71
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,991
Don't worry three years
will pass by like a flash.

72
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,125
And don't forget...

73
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:22,795
No matter the distance,
our friendship lasts forever.

74
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,335
Well, I guess it's time!

75
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,273
[CAPTAIN]
All right, men!

76
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,775
We're setting sail!
Hoist the anchor!

77
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,344
[CREW cheers]

78
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,349
[CROCUS]
Laboon!

79
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,287
You have to wait for us here
and mind Crocus, Laboon.

80
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,389
Don't worry we'll be back...

81
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,690
I promise.

82
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,705
[CROCUS]
That was fifty long years ago.

83
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:06,706
[SANJI]
Fifty years?!

84
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,574
So, Laboon has been
waiting all this time

85
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,043
for his friends to return...

86
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,711
No wonder he's upset...

87
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,980
That kind of wait
would drive anyone crazy!

88
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,858
[ZORO]
This is some canal...

89
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,327
Amazing this
whale's still alive,

90
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,262
with a hole like
this in his body.

91
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,897
[SANJI] I suppose you're
responsible for this?

92
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,765
[CROCUS]
Just a doctor's playful mind...

93
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,733
[USOPP]
Doctor?!

94
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,534
That's right.

95
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,902
Legally certified...

96
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,405
I also ran a clinic on
the cape once upon a time.

97
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,741
Before that,
I served as a ship's doctor.

98
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:42,909
[LUFFY]
Really?

99
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:43,743
That's great...

100
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,745
Then join us,
we need a doctor.

101
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:46,946
[CROCUS]
Don't be ridiculous.

102
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,716
I no longer have
that kind of energy.

103
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,552
Exploring the seas is
a young man's burden.

104
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:53,853
[SANJI] What kind
of a doctor hollows out

105
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,288
the inside of a whale...

106
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,789
[NAMI] Maybe it's
part of the treatment.

107
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,091
The girl is right...

108
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,258
With a creature of this size,

109
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,095
it's virtually impossible to
treat it from the outside.

110
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,864
Therefore, I devised a more
drastic solution.

111
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,632
Here's the exit...

112
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,879
[LUFFY]
The sky.

113
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,625
What is it?

114
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,662
[USOPP] Don't you think
fifty years is a bit extreme?

115
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,065
Those pirates sure know how
to test someone's patience!

116
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,633
[SANJI]
Idiot! Don't ya get it?

117
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,101
This is the Grand Line.

118
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,071
His friends are dead.

119
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,808
That whale can wait forever,
they won't be back.

120
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,910
Sad to say,
but that's probably true...

121
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,945
Back in the day when those
guys traveled the Grand Line

122
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,013
it was an uncharted sea,

123
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,482
a thousand times more
treacherous than it is now.

124
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,584
Ugh! Why are you all
being so pessimistic?

125
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,819
You don't know
that they're dead!

126
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,654
They could still
come back for him!

127
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,756
Come on. Have some
sympathy, will ya?!

128
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,358
I thought it was very touching!

129
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,959
I mean a whale still
believing a promise

130
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,961
his friends made
despite all these years?!

131
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,997
That's a true bond!
Right, pops?!

132
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:11,998
[CROCUS]
Indeed...

133
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,435
But the lesson here
is that reality is cruel.

134
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,637
Laboon's cohorts aren't dead.

135
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,139
The truth is,
they abandoned their quest.

136
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,676
I learned that they turned tail
and left the Grand Line.

137
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,944
[USOPP]
I don't believe it.

138
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:28,681
I mean, why abandon
him like that?

139
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,517
[NAMI] You say they ran
away from the Grand Line.

140
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,686
Do you know if they made it
through the Calm Belt alive?

141
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,522
[CROCUS] I can't claim to know
exactly what became of them,

142
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,192
but I doubt they'll ever
come back here again.

143
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:43,162
Seasons, weather, currents, wind
direction‐‐on the Grand Line,

144
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,866
these elements seem to
defy the very laws of nature.

145
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,701
Common sense is useless,

146
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:52,138
and the terror of that fact
can be quite overwhelming.

147
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,040
So, if I've got this straight,
what you're saying is,

148
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,875
these pirates were
a bunch of cowards,

149
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,710
who cared more about
saving their own asses,

150
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,046
than keeping a
promise to a friend?

151
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,717
Why would anyone abandon
such a loyal creature?!

152
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,918
Just look at him!

153
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,554
It's cruelty on a grand scale!

154
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,823
But if you've known all this,
why haven't you told him?

155
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,025
Laboon can obviously
communicate with you.

156
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,862
He seems to understand
humans quite well for a whale.

157
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,029
[CROCUS]
I did tell him...

158
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,732
...down to the last,
miserable detail.

159
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,735
I know this isn't what you want
to hear, but it's the truth.

160
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,171
Your friends left
the Grand Line.

161
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,074
The bond you shared
with each other was real.

162
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:32,411
Just as real as the promise they
made to return for you one day.

163
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,952
[CROCUS]
But, still... face the facts...

164
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,455
Those men are
never coming back.

165
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:48,528
[LABOON roars mornfully]

166
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:03,709
Laboon! Please!

167
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,146
I say this for your own good!
They're not coming back!

168
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,292
I understand that
you don't wanna accept it!

169
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,728
But you need to realize
that this is how things are!

170
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,964
Listen...

171
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,570
Laboon!!

172
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,615
[CROCUS] That was
the day that Laboon began

173
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,850
to howl at Reverse Mountain...

174
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:49,155
Soon after, he started slamming
his body against the Red Line.

175
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,825
It's as if he believes that wall
is what keeps his friends away,

176
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:57,597
and by breaking it, he can
clear the path for their return.

177
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,931
[SANJI]
I admire his dedication...

178
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,666
[USOPP]
Never gave up on 'em.

179
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,001
He refuses to believe me,

180
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:05,004
because then he'd have
to admit that it's over.

181
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,773
And that terrifies him
more than anything.

182
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,209
There's no way for him to
go back to the West Blue...

183
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:14,046
So, what we have is a
paradox of tragic proportions.

184
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,850
Laboon is a lost soul dying
to live with his friends,

185
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,186
but won't stop killing
himself to reach them...

186
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,889
Tragedy. Still for all the grief
those pirates put him through

187
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,193
they did the same to you by
saddling you with their burden.

188
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,230
I mean you've done
enough for Laboon.

189
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,131
What about you...?

190
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,200
[CROCUS]
The scars on his hide are deep.

191
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,369
Those in his heart
are even deeper...

192
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,237
He needs someone
to tend his wounds,

193
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,039
and I'm all he's got...

194
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,209
For years, he's battered himself
while I've patched him up...

195
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,745
A strange friendship,
but it works.

196
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,915
What the hell
is that idiot up to?

197
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,884
Ya gotta watch
him every second...

198
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,986
[SANJI] We've been watching him,
look what happens...

199
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,889
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum...

200
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,059
...Flower Arrangement!

201
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,194
Think he's aware
that's our mast...?

202
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,196
And now it's on top of a whale.

203
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,065
Why'd he do that?

204
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,734
Hey Luffy, stop
tearing up the ship.

205
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,007
[howls]

206
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,943
You... ass...! Luffy... stop...!

207
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,288
The boy...! He's dead!

208
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,256
Oh don't worry...!

209
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,192
It'll take way more
than that to kill Luffy!

210
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,931
Ha...! Gotcha!

211
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,073
What does he
think he's doing?!

212
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,111
[ZORO]
You wanna let us in on your plan

213
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,813
before ya kill yourself?!

214
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,985
[LUFFY]
It's a draw!

215
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,892
[LUFFY]
I'm stronger than I look!

216
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,395
But, I have a
feeling you knew that...

217
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,164
I can always tell when
someone's itching to fight...

218
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,334
Well, if you want a battle,
I'll gladly give you one...

219
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,670
Your shipmates used to
spar with you didn't they?

220
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,671
You miss it.

221
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,108
Well, I can rival
anything they threw at ya!

222
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,109
Tell ya what‐‐

223
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,010
after me and my friends
travel the Grand Line,

224
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,846
we'll come back
here and find you.

225
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:33,619
And then you better be
ready for a rematch!

226
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,883
[LUFFY]
Hey, not bad!

227
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,818
Consider this a
symbol of my promise

228
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,953
to come do battle with you...

229
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,155
Of course,
it's a rush paint job,

230
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,824
so you'll have to be careful
and avoid hitting your head

231
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:12,825
or you'll rub it right off.

232
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,560
Understand?

233
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,964
Good whale!

234
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,501
[USOPP]
Where are they?

235
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,404
Where are who...?
Oh, you mean those two wierdos?

236
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,539
I guess they escaped.

237
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,475
Must have happened when
we were distracted by Laboon.

238
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,910
I wonder who they were...

239
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,680
Miss Wednesday...

240
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,649
What are we going to do now?

241
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,386
First, put some
distance between us

242
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,053
and these morons.

243
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,321
Then we report to the Boss.

244
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,424
Our time for completing this
mission has long since run out.

245
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,826
[MR. 9]
I can hear the others now.

246
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,428
They're probably
already calling us traitors.

247
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,095
I know...

248
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,363
But without our weapons,

249
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,933
we've no choice but to go back
to the office and start over.

250
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,735
[MR. 9] And this time no
one will stop us...

251
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,205
Aaaah!

252
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,539
No, no! I couldn't have!

253
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,674
What is it?

254
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,943
It's... gone.

255
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,077
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
What?!

256
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,412
[LUFFY]
Huh?

257
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,848
Hmm... What's this thing?

258
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,950
[MISS WEDNESDAY] How could
you have lost the Log Pose?!

259
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,017
[MR. 9]
I don't know!

260
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,086
I must've dropped it somewhere!

261
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,889
But we're not going
anywhere without it...

262
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,791
‐‐[MISS WEDNESDAY] How awful!
‐‐[MR. 9 gasps]

263
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,927
Ah! No! This can't
be happening...

264
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,095
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
Wha‐‐?!

265
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,066
[MR. 9]
It's...! Ahhhh...

266
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,468
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
Oh no!

267
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,803
[MR. 9]
The Unluckies!!

268
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,937
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
We're out of time!

269
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,105
[MR. 9]
Mr. 13!

270
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,074
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
Miss Friday!

271
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:35,941
Don't be hasty!

272
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,643
Please, we can explain!

273
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,745
We'll check in with
Boss immediately!

274
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:40,980
Aaaah!

275
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,885
[screams]

276
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:55,628
Okay, then!

277
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,762
I finally have some
peace and quiet

278
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,900
so I can work on a plan
for the Grand Line journey.

279
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,740
Ah... Don't think I forgot about
you, Elephant Blue Fin Tuna!

280
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,510
Damn... That's my life...!

281
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,946
Luffy breaks it then
I put it back together!

282
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,814
Hey, get off your lazy butt
and give me a hand!

283
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,850
This ship isn't gonna
fix itself you know!

284
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:22,154
[NAMI screams]

285
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,291
You mind? Keep it down.

286
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,293
[SANJI] Is there some problem,
my dearest Nami?!

287
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,495
If it's food you're worried
about, say no more!

288
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,329
[USOPP]
Someone say "food"?

289
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,965
You idiots!
The compass is broken!

290
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,167
The needle just spins!
It won't stop!

291
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,635
Oh, yeah, you're right.

292
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,671
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting dizzy!

293
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,606
Whoa... This is cool!

294
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,875
It is sadly apparent
that none of you

295
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,512
possess the slightest knowledge
about how things work here...

296
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,814
Did you all come here to die?

297
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,182
Ah, great spread!

298
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,717
It's for everyone!

299
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,986
[CROCUS] There is nothing
wrong with your compass.

300
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,623
The Grand Line has little
regard for the rules of the sea.

301
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,726
Common sense is
useless in this place.

302
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,895
The needle... Why does it spin?

303
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,029
[CROCUS]
Because we are surrounded

304
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,165
by a powerful magnetic field.

305
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,001
The islands here are riddled
with magnetic minerals,

306
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,004
which cause all
sorts of abnormalities.

307
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,740
Also, the winds and
currents lack constancy

308
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,975
in their patterns.

309
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,678
As a navigator, I'm sure you
can appreciate this dilemma.

310
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:20,546
So then...

311
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,147
If we don't have
a way to tell direction,

312
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,716
this whole trip is hopeless...

313
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:24,750
Yummy!

314
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,985
I don't know what to say...

315
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,086
We're screwed...

316
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,688
Hey! You're the navigator,
so navigate us outta here!

317
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,824
This is delicious!
You oughta try some!

318
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,659
Would all of you just
shut up for five seconds

319
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:34,760
so I can figure this out!

320
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,696
This nose of the Elephant
Tuna is my favorite part!

321
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,731
Tasty!

322
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,866
If you have any hope of
navigating the Grand Line,

323
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,569
you're going to need
a Log Pose to guide you.

324
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:44,670
[NAMI]
Log Pose?

325
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:45,704
I've never heard of it.

326
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,039
It's a specially
designed compass

327
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,708
that can record levels
of magnetism.

328
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,010
[LUFFY]
Is it strange looking?

329
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,679
Why, yes, it does
have an odd shape.

330
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,280
[LUFFY]
Something like this?

331
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,248
Yes, exactly...

332
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,884
Only a fool courting
disaster would attempt

333
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,954
to travel the
Grand Line without one.

334
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:03,956
Understood...

335
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,392
Excuse me for one second.

336
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,559
So...

337
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,863
Why didn't you tell me you
had one of those Log things?!

338
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,899
[LUFFY] I found it on deck,
just laying there.

339
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:16,702
Those two weirdoes must've
dropped it when they escaped.

340
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,636
Did they?

341
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,937
[LUFFY]
Why'd you hit me?

342
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:19,905
Felt like it...

343
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,241
[LUFFY]
Oh, okay.

344
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,910
Huh, but there isn't a
dial face on this thing.

345
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,780
[CROCUS] You don't need one.
It's a special brand

346
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,149
of magnetism that runs
through the Grand Line islands.

347
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,818
Complete with its own set of
rules that makes it possible

348
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,386
to get around.

349
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,256
By recording the level of
magnetism between two islands,

350
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:40,893
you can chart a route
from one island to the next.

351
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,829
The log pose method
is really the only choice.

352
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,265
Since the magnetism here
presents huge problems

353
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,267
for conventional navigation...

354
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,937
As it turns out Reverse Mountain
is a great starting point.

355
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,673
It produces seven
levels of magnetism.

356
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,643
But it doesn't matter which one
you choose to start with.

357
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,079
Eventually all of them
will pull against each other

358
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,780
and form one route.

359
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,783
And the island at the
end of that route...

360
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:05,818
..is Raftel.

361
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,954
The last and most mysterious
in the Grand Line...

362
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,689
It's very existence
was confirmed

363
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,692
by the King of the Pirates,
the only known person

364
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,795
to have traveled the
Grand Line in its entirety.

365
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:17,930
Raftel...

366
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:18,931
That's it!

367
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,799
That must be where
the One Piece is hidden...

368
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,468
[CROCUS] That's the
most prominent theory,

369
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:26,672
but no one's been able to
set foot on Raftel Island since.

370
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,142
Don't worry.
We'll know soon enough!

371
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,712
Well, I'm satisfied!

372
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,980
You guys ready to go?

373
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,882
I told you that
was for all of us!

374
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,817
He... He even ate the bones!

375
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:39,651
A Log Pose...

376
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,353
We have to take
special care of this...

377
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,289
It's the key to finding the
greatest treasure of all time!

378
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,691
You greedy, bottomless pit!

379
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,326
You ate the meal
I made for Nami!

380
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:51,029
Well I hope you left room...
for your dessert!

381
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,147
[LUFFY] Ow!
Why's everyone hitting me?!

382
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,882
[SANJI] You never think of
anyone but yourself and‐‐!

383
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:10,415
[NAMI]
Sanji...

384
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,317
[SANJI]
Yes...?

385
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,520
[NAMI]
Both of you get out of my sight

386
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:21,059
before I wring your necks!

387
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,361
[USOPP]
Okay, so...

388
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,595
Correct me if I'm wrong,

389
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,198
but doesn't the Log Pose work
better when it's not broken?!

390
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,534
Oh no... Our log pose is ruined!

391
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,868
[CROCUS]
Calm yourselves...

392
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,370
I will give you my own...

393
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,906
...as a "thank you"
for helping Laboon.

394
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,415
Oh good, I'm not dead...

395
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,452
[SANJI]
Hello, dear lady.

396
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,388
Allow me to
help you to your feet.

397
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,422
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
Oh, thank you.

398
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,523
[SANJI]
Nice day, don't you think?

399
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,058
[MR. 9]
Hey!

400
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,093
We need a favor.

401
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,767
[LUFFY]
Whisky Peak?

402
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,101
Huh. That's a funny name.

403
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,436
[USOPP]
So what is it?

404
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,939
[MR. 9]
That's where we live... Um, sir.

405
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:07,906
[NAMI]
How were you stranded?

406
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,874
Where's your ship?

407
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,077
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
Well... It was destroyed.

408
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,646
Asking us for a
ride is pushing it, Mr. 9;

409
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,548
especially after you
tried to kill the whale?

410
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,716
What's with the wardrobe?

411
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:18,884
What are you supposed to be?

412
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,553
I am a king!

413
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,721
You're lying.

414
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:23,922
No, please!

415
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,057
We can't say!

416
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,291
She's right.

417
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,660
You have to believe us, our only
motive here is getting home.

418
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,096
We'd tell you everything
if we could, it's just that...

419
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,165
..."mystery" is
our company's motto.

420
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,900
You see, we have
to be mysterious!

421
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,068
It's sort of a rule...

422
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,736
[MISS WEDNESDAY] We have
confidence in your character.

423
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,605
Can't you give us
the same courtesy?!

424
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:40,806
[MR. 9]
Please! We're begging you!

425
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,074
Show some mercy!

426
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,008
Don't do it...

427
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,611
These two fools are
dishonest to the core.

428
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,079
They can't be trusted.

429
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,080
Listen...

430
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,281
I should mention that
our Log Pose was broken,

431
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,618
and we don't have another one,
so still wana ride with us?

432
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,819
What...?! You broke it?!

433
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:54,519
That was mine!

434
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,854
Those aren't cheap, you know?!

435
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,755
You're stuck here too?!

436
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,090
How long were you
gonna make us beg

437
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,992
before you
bothered to tell us?!

438
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,160
Oh... Sorry... I forgot.

439
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,097
Crocus gave us
his Log Pose, so...

440
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,933
[MR. 9]
Oh! Please have pity on us!

441
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,203
[MR. 9] That lousy bitch!
She tricked us!

442
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,438
It's fine...
You can ride with us.

443
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,941
[LUFFY] You said your home
is called Whisky Peak?

444
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,709
Let's go there.

445
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,012
Why?! These two are obviously
some pretty shady characters.

446
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,847
Why would we
take them anywhere?!

447
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,949
It's fine...
Don't sweat the small stuff.

448
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,950
We'll be all right.

449
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,551
Choose your route carefully.

450
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,786
Once you head out from here,

451
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,955
you'll be committed
to that course.

452
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,156
That's okay.
If we don't like it,

453
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,725
we'll try a different
route next time.

454
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,960
I see...

455
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,629
Okay...!It's time we get going!

456
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,831
[LUFFY] Now that me and
Laboon have an understanding,

457
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,900
I can leave with
a clear conscience!

458
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,469
Just who on earth do
you think you are anyway?

459
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,238
What's that...? Me?

460
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,541
Oh, I'm the man who'll
be King of the Pirates!

461
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,681
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
Not too bright, this one...

462
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,050
[CROCUS]
Should be good to go.

463
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,687
The Log Pose has had plenty
of time to store the route.

464
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,223
The needle should be pointing in
the same direction as the map.

465
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,060
It's pointing
directly to Whisky Peak.

466
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:08,994
[LUFFY]
See ya, pops!

467
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,763
Thanks again for the Log Pose!
Take care!

468
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,231
[CROCUS]
Have a safe trip, my boy!

469
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,666
[LUFFY]
I'm off, Laboon!

470
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,069
Be ready to fight
when I get back!

471
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,575

Next stop, Whisky Peak!

Luffy and his
exuberant crew could be

475
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,936
the very pirates
we've been waiting for...

476
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,772
That young captain
sure has a way about him.

477
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,274
It's uncanny really...
