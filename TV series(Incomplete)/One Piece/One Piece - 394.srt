1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,158
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,785
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,290
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:50,336
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,090
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,510
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,721
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,266
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,352
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,647
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,193
[NARRATOR] Upon reaching
the archipelago,

48
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,695
Luffy and his crew met
a bar owner named Shakky

49
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,822
who told them about
the 11 Supernovas

50
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,658
and a pirate craftsman
who could coat the Sunny.

51
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,535
[LUFFY]
We're here!

52
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,703
Sabaody Park!

53
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,413
[ALL]
Yay!

54
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,797
[CHOPPER]
Camie's been kidnapped!

55
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,549
Wait, what did you say?

56
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,385
[LUFFY]
Rescue Camie!

57
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,555
The Archipelago's
Lingering Dark History!

58
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,527
[SANJI] Damn it,
what's taking 'em so long?

59
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,404
[DUVAL]
Young master!

60
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,281
Finally.

61
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,533
[DUVAL]
Yahoo!

62
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,743
Handsome's here!

63
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,162
Oh, I'm sorry,
I mean, Duval's here!

64
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,248
[FISH RIDERS]
So are we!

65
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,625
[DUVAL] How are you,
young master Black Leg?

66
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,501
[SANJI]
Angry!

67
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,169
'Cause you Fish Riders
took too long!

68
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,421
We're not Fish Riders
anymore, young master!

69
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,130
You remember?

70
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,175
We're the Rosy Life Riders now!

71
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,594
You're frikkin' annoying, okay?
That's what you are!

72
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,096
It's our mermaid friend.

73
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,265
She got kidnapped
in Sabaody Park.

74
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,475
I called you
to help us find her.

75
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,601
Not kidnappers!

76
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,852
How horrible!

77
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,313
[FISH RIDERS] They sound
like devious villains!

78
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,108
[USOPP] You guys were kidnappers
too, like, what, yesterday?

79
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,859
They say it takes
a thief to catch one.

80
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,111
So here we are!

81
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:38,861
Are you guys up for this?

82
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:39,737
[DUVAL]
But of course!

83
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,614
We shall do our
very best to serve you!

84
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,283
[FISH RIDERS]
Your wish is our command!

85
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,826
[USOPP]
Can we really trust these guys?

86
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,412
Oh, and by the by,
before I came here.

87
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,123
I showed off my new
looks to some ladies.

88
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,875
Hey Head, check it out!

89
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,669
There're some
cute girls over there!

90
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,920
All right then, let's go!

91
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,796
So did you like it?

92
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,839
Oh yeah, it was great!

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,508
[DUVAL]
Hello there, ladies!

94
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,803
I'm handsome! How do you do?

95
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,013
Whaddya say?

96
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:09,267
Wanna take a seaside stroll on
my big, strong Motobalo--

97
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,521
[giggling]

98
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,942
And?

99
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,362
I wasn't quite the success
that I imagined I would be.

100
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,823
[SANJI] Well, I can fix
your face, but not your brain,

101
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,742
or your annoying personality.

102
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,868
But that's all right!

103
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,412
I'll help you out.
Don't you worry!

104
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,872
We just need to find
your mermaid friend

105
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,498
before she gets sold, right?

106
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,499
You got it.

107
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,667
Since you're from around here,

108
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,503
I figure you must know the
archipelago better than us.

109
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,213
Why, of course we do!

110
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,506
Sabaody is our backyard!

111
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,216
We know all the ins and outs.

112
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,552
You won't find a
better tour guide than us!

113
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,721
[FISH RIDER 386A]
Okay! Hop on!

114
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,389
We're taking the Flying Fish?

115
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,682
You bet we are!

116
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,975
Right, ready when you are!

117
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,684
Right!

118
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,518
Uh...

119
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,228
How do you guys
plan on finding her?

120
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,104
Now don't fret.

121
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,898
Those of a trade
know each other's ways,

122
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,775
and we were once
kidnappers as well!

123
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,401
I can think of a
few groups already

124
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,195
that might
be responsible.

125
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,282
First off, we'll
take a quick cruise

126
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,284
across the groves and
pick up the rest of your crew

127
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,911
so they can help
with the search.

128
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,828
In the meantime,

129
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,663
we'll try and find
out which kidnappers

130
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,457
grabbed your mermaid friend!

131
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,004
Let's go! Full speed ahead!

132
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,715
[ALL]
Yeah!

133
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,099
Don't worry.

134
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,725
We won't let anyone
hurt you, Camie!

135
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,310
We're on our way right now!

136
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,396
Hey, Duval,
let's speed this up!

137
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,939
Ahaha!
You're so funny!

138
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,316
Motobalo's already
going at full speed!

139
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,652
Good. If we're
at maximum speed...

140
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,655
What? This is as
fast as this goes?

141
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,241
[DUVAL]
Hold on tight!

142
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,870
[CHOPPER]
I hope this works out.

143
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,706
Sanji! What now?

144
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,707
[SANJI]
It's gonna be okay!

145
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,043
Just stay right there
and don't move an inch.

146
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,920
I'll send someone
there to get you.

147
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,004
[CHOPPER]
Okay.

148
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,256
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL 394A]
Click!

149
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,677
Luffy!
Sanji says not to go--

150
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,762
[PAPPAGU]
Camie!

151
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,475
Just to be safe,
we should still wait here

152
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,686
instead of breaking
up the group even more.

153
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,438
Don't you think, Brook?

154
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,441
[BROOK]
Eh?

155
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,444
Why are you acting so calm?

156
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,571
This is bad news!
Camie was kidnapped!

157
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,697
She's gonna get
sold to some creep

158
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,532
and be a slave for
the rest of her life

159
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,992
if we don't go and
save her right now!

160
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,953
Yohoho!
Let me put it this way.

161
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,330
Sanji gave us very
specific instructions

162
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,833
to stay here and wait for
someone to come pick us up.

163
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,751
And, no matter what we do,

164
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,503
our wait will be just as long.

165
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,380
Oh. That makes sense.

166
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,923
Though we try
to make it pass,

167
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,801
time marches on at its own pace.

168
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,428
If we are forced to wait,

169
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,681
then why not do so
in peace and tranquility?

170
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,517
Brilliant!

171
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:02,982
Hey, Head!

172
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,443
We made it to Sabaody Park,
what's next?

173
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,819
[DUVAL] Find the
rest of the Straw Hats

174
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,571
and pick up
one member each!

175
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,614
Right!

176
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,161
[FISH RIDER 387A]
They were supposed to wait

177
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,955
by Public Transponder Snail #5,
which should be right here.

178
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,748
Yeah!

179
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,000
There they are!
See? On the bench!

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,919
It looks like Brook and Chopper!

181
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,926
All right, you guys,
we're ready to go!

182
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,093
Hurry up! Let's...

183
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,473
Why are you two so relaxed?
This is serious!

184
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,558
Ah, look, Chopper.

185
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,061
Usopp came to pick us
up in no time at all.

186
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,646
[CHOPPER] Luffy and
everyone else flipped out

187
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,565
and ran off somewhere
on their own, but not us.

188
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,150
We waited in
peace and tranquility

189
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,652
like we were supposed--

190
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,863
Let's go!

191
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,866
Operation: Save Camie
At All Costs is under way!

192
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,452
Yes! Let's go all out!

193
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,620
No relaxing!

194
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,204
Brook!

195
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,039
He... He got mad at us!

196
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,083
--No fair!
--I do admit, I regret it now!

197
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,960
Just a little bit,
but I regret it.

198
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,003
[DUVAL] Keep on the lookout
for every kidnapping team

199
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,213
on the archipelago!

200
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,424
It's gotta be one of them,
so it's only a matter of time!

201
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,051
And I know the other
Straw Hats ran off,

202
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,719
but we still gotta
find them, too!

203
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,846
[FISH RIDER 387A]
Roger! Let's split up!

204
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,764
[FISH RIDERS]
Right!

205
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,517
We're betting
our pride on this!

206
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,602
You better not let
the young master down!

207
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,605
Do this fast
and do it right, okay?

208
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,856
That should be good enough.

209
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,899
[SANJI]
Good enough for who?

210
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,443
And can't you do something
about this slow-ass cow?

211
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,821
If I'd known it was like this,
I would have got on a fish!

212
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,698
What?
You said I'm handsome?

213
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,740
Not even close!

214
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,576
Also, you're the
head of your gang!

215
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,077
Why are you stuck
on the slowest ride

216
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,704
when everyone else can fly?

217
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,580
Huh?

218
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,206
Why would you say
something like that?

219
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,667
Of course I'm the most
handsome person on the team!

220
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,876
There's no competition.

221
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,753
[SANJI] Just shut up
and step on it, okay?

222
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,548
[DUVAL]
Yes, young master!

223
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,268
Hey! I got someone
who needs a doctor!

224
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,227
Come on, pal!

225
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,063
This isn't an
emergency room, you know!

226
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,398
But what's wrong with him?

227
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,649
[ZORO]
He needs urgent care.

228
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,401
[DOCTOR 394A]
Wow, this looks bad.

229
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,279
Let's see. Nope, no collar.

230
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,114
And why would
having a collar matter?

231
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,115
Well,

232
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,576
medical treatment for
slaves costs 50% more,

233
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,661
so sometimes it's
cheaper to buy a new one.

234
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,081
This guy is hurt and
that's all that matters.

235
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,500
So are you gonna
help him or not?

236
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,169
Yes! Of course, I will!

237
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,920
Hurry, take him inside!

238
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,011
This place is
starting to piss me off.

239
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,929
Better head back to the ship.

240
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,224
[ZORO]
Should be Grove 1, I think.

241
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,522
What, you want a mermaid?

242
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,108
If you're just window
shopping, get outta here, kid.

243
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,985
I'm telling you,
our friend got kidnapped!

244
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,612
So listen, has
someone come in here

245
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,280
trying to sell a mermaid or not?

246
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,615
[HACHI]
We need information!

247
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,951
If you know anything,
you gotta tell us, please!

248
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,707
I don't know nothin',

249
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,376
but it's not in
your best interest

250
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,294
to stick your nose
into that kinda stuff.

251
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,337
Just as a warning.

252
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,423
Do you swear no one
came here to sell a mermaid?

253
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:14,924
Yeah!

254
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,966
Yeah, I swear it!

255
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:16,550
No one today!

256
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,551
Stop it, Straw Hat!

257
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,304
It'll only be harder on
us if you cause trouble!

258
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,515
[SELLER 394A]
If you don't believe me,

259
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,975
you're free to check
out the place if you want!

260
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:26,852
[LUFFY]
Octoguy!

261
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,521
Let's look around the shop!

262
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,563
[HACHI]
'Kay.

263
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,237
Do they just kidnap
anyone they can grab

264
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,780
and pawn them off to this place?

265
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,533
[HACHI]
Nyuu. Camie...

266
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,036
Hey!

267
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,083
[LUFFY] Did you guys
have any luck?

268
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,168
No, looks like he
was telling the truth.

269
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,003
[PAPPAGU]
Camie!

270
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,464
[LUFFY] Hey!
You got any others to show?

271
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,174
[SELLER 394A] I don't got
a warehouse or anything,

272
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,218
so what you see is what you get.

273
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,177
Come on, Straw Hat!

274
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,762
We're gonna have to
look somewhere else.

275
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,556
[SELLER 394A]
Hey! I just remembered.

276
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,225
Now that you mention it,
I do have a mermaid.

277
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,643
For real? Do you mean it?

278
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,145
Yeah, but only one.

279
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,771
This pretty little thing here.

280
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,273
Her name's Marin!

281
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,358
If you like her, I'll cut
you guys a good deal!

282
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,444
Don't you wanna take me home?

283
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,487
[LUFFY, HACHI, PAPPAGU] There's
no way in hell that's a mermaid!

284
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,740
I saw him in the shop
just a second ago!

285
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,326
It's really hard
to breathe in here.

286
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:25,828
Hey!

287
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,038
[PAPPAGU]
C-Camie, why?

288
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,124
Camie!

289
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,084
Where are you?

290
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,921
Hey, check it out!

291
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,091
That guy's Straw Hat Luffy
from the East Blue, isn't he?

292
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,342
He's shorter than I thought.

293
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,844
Nyuu. Don't lose hope!

294
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,387
Maybe she hasn't been sold yet.

295
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,223
We just gotta figure out
which kidnappers grabbed her.

296
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,769
Could you give the
crying a rest, already?

297
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,353
We're gonna find her--
stop whining!

298
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:55,441
Damn it!
This is all my fault!

299
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,443
The amusement park
is the number one spot

300
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,653
for kidnappers
to pick people up.

301
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,654
I knew they'd be on the lookout

302
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:04,825
for a mermaid like her,
but I didn't do a thing!

303
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,328
[LUFFY] Whoa, they've got
all kinds of ice cream here!

304
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,621
What flavor do you want?

305
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,457
[PAPPAGU] Hold on.
I gotta go see for myself.

306
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,709
I'll be right back Camie,
you wait here!

307
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,253
Yeah, okay,

308
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,422
but get something yummy
for me too, all right?

309
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,425
I'm never gonna see her again

310
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,594
and the last thing
I said was about ice cream!

311
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,846
It's terrible!

312
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,265
I never should've let her
go to that amusement park!

313
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,351
What was I thinking?

314
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,602
It's just...

315
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:35,105
I've dreamed of this moment
ever since I was a little girl.

316
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,860
I've never been so
high up in the air before!

317
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,362
I'll always remember this day.

318
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,572
Thank you so much!

319
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,199
You didn't do anything wrong!

320
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,117
She was really happy
we got to go!

321
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,744
It's nobody's fault
it turned out like that!

322
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,870
You don't get it!

323
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,457
Truth is, it's a terrible idea
for fishmen and merfolk

324
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,875
to come to this place at all!

325
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,001
But Hachi...

326
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,128
He wanted to help you guys
after what you did for us,

327
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:58,796
and I felt the same way--

328
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,755
Pappagu!

329
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,923
Don't say any more!

330
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,633
We're stuck
like this, either way.

331
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,343
You might as well
tell me why it's so bad

332
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,511
for you to come here.

333
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,637
What's the big deal?

334
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,429
[HACHI]
Well, uh...

335
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,639
The kidnappers.

336
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,642
They're not the only enemies
Camie and Hachi have in Sabaody.

337
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,186
In fact, you might say everyone
on the whole archipelago

338
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,312
is their enemy.

339
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,650
[NAMI]
200 years ago?

340
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,484
[ROBIN]
Yes.

341
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,194
It's more recent
than you would think,

342
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,363
but things used to be
quite terrible here.

343
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,156
The fishman and merfolk races

344
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,700
were considered
the same as fish.

345
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,618
And humans all over
the world persecuted them

346
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,745
in every possible way.

347
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,372
They were seen
as lesser than human

348
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,832
and they were
treated as such.

349
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,586
That's a surprise,
since they're so strong!

350
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,922
[ROBIN] Perhaps, but strength
in numbers is greater still

351
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,550
and they were treated
cruelly by everyone

352
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,844
until the World Government
declared friendly relations

353
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,053
with Fishman Island.

354
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,182
[ROBIN] Slavery is another relic
from that unfortunate past,

355
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,519
and human trafficking is still
very alive on this archipelago.

356
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,938
In fact, it may
even be condoned.

357
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,524
If such a deplorable
tradition still remains,

358
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,693
it wouldn't surprise me if
they continued to discriminate

359
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,696
against fishmen
and merfolk here, as well.

360
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,780
Persecution?

[PAPPAGU] You're a fool
if you can't see this place

362

for what it really is!

363
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,453
The human trafficking is
just the icing on the cake!

364
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,330
But I should know better,

365
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:18,375
so I blame myself for not
stopping Camie when we got here!

00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,668
[NAMI]
That explains the disguises.

367
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,630
They didn't want people to know
that they weren't human, huh?

368
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,257
[ROBIN] Let's just hope these
fears of mine are unfounded.

"girlie?" What's wrong with you?

Get on the Flying Fish, quick!

373
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,226
Somebody kidnapped
the mer-chick!

374
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:36,936
They took Camie?

375
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,021

Stop apologizing!

There isn't anything
to be sorry for!

you are my friends now!

no matter what, okay?

Yeah, if there's still
time to submit an entry.

Sure, but we've
got a giant today.

fetch a very high price

have a look for yourself?

Could we refrain from kneeling
in the auction house, sir?

00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:39,983
That haki there.

521
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,777
It was yours, wasn't it?

522
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,154
Just who in the hell
are you, old man?

523
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,283
[OLD MAN] I'm just a simple
ship coater, nothing more.

524
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,340
What can I say?

525
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,884
I have a soft-spot
for young girls.

526
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,763
Though I may have
overdone it a bit.

527
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,316
[SANJI] You have no
right to sell Camie,

528
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,484
you sick bastard!

529
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,028
I won't let you get away with
conducting dirty business

530
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,072
like this! You hear me?

531
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,698
[NAMI]
That's enough, Sanji.

532
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,324
Let's go.

533
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,200
[SANJI]
But Nami...

534
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,827
[NAMI]
If we can't reason with them,

535
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,703
we'll just have to play
by their own rules

536
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,122
to get Camie back!

537
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,832
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

538
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,709
"TIme Limit!
The Human Auction Begins!"

539
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,170
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
