[MOCHA] So... the Master
is a bad person?

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:34.326
[CHOPPER]
Yes, a very bad person.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.729
But he's always
been so nice to us.

00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:41.434
The candy he gives us is yummy,
and we get to eat it every day.

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:42.735
[CHOPPER]
That's how he trapped you.

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:44.904
What? But why?

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:50.109
You children are
his test subjects.

00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:52.078
How... How do you know?

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:54.380
[SYND]
Hey, Mocha! Open up!

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:56.982
We need to go to the
Biscuit Room right now!

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:59.985
[CHILDREN]
Candy!

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:01.921
[CHOPPER ] The truth is,
none of you were sick

00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:03.489
when he brought you here.

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:04.690
That can't be true!
You're wrong!

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.827
How do you think you wound up
with a body that enormous?

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.695
I've heard rumors
about experiments that

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.964
have been going on for
hundreds of years now.

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:15.201
People all around the world
attempting to create giants.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:16.802
I say "attempting"
because nobody

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:21.340
has ever succeeded before.
The experiments always fail.

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:24.543
I'm sorry, but there's something
that I have to tell you.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:25.911
[MOCHA gasps]

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:32.351
Caesar's experiment...
is doomed, too.

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:33.786
[MOCHA gasps]

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.654
[CHOPPER] He knows
that it's going to fail.

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:39.625
My guess is he's just collecting
data for his next experiment.

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:44.964
[MOCHA ] So... what's
going to happen to us?

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:48.534
[grunts]

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:52.104
Death.

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:54.406
None of you will
live to see home again.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.307
[MOCHA gasps]

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:58.110
That delicious candy
is a fatal toxin.

00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:01.580
It tastes sweet, but the truth
is, it's destroying your body.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.717
And as soon as you eat one,
you start to crave another.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:09.021
The more you eat, the more
control Caesar has over you.

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:12.458
Before long, you'll do
anything for another piece,

00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:14.160
just like those kids in there.

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:16.695
[MOCHA gasps]

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:22.601
[CHOPPER]
I sedated you.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.670
That's why you're calm now.

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:26.705
But there are side
effects from the candy

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:29.308
and the experiment itself.

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:34.580
Before you reach adulthood,
you will likely die.

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:41.220
[whimpering] Mocha!

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.841
[whimpering]

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:05.644
[MOCHA] We won't ever be
grownups? That can't be right.

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:08.480
What about our homes?
Our mommies and daddies?

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:11.750
Will we get to see them again?

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:13.586
[gasps]

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:18.123
You won't, unless
you leave soon.

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:21.527
[gasps]

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.395
A lot of things
have scared us here.

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:27.199
We never even thought
about that, though.

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:28.400
When we asked you for help,

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:31.103
it was because we
wanted to go home again.

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:33.038
We wanted the chance
to see our families

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.773
instead of being
stuck here another year

00:14:34.807 --> 00:14:37.142
without knowing
what we were sick with.

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:38.911
[MOCHA whimpers]

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:44.350
[MOCHA]
But we...

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:47.820
[gasping]

00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:54.593
[MOCHA crying]

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:58.530
We never... [cries]

00:14:58.564 --> 00:14:59.999
We never actually thought that

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:03.435
we were going to
die here though.

00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:06.171
We thought we were gonna
leave here once we got better.

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:09.008
That's what he said,
and we believed him.

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:11.644
We ate that candy because
they gave it to us.

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:13.812
We didn't know
we would die from it!

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:17.549
Yes, I know! It's not
your fault--none of this is!

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:18.617
That's why

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:21.487
we're gonna do whatever
it takes to defeat Caesar.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.188
Nothing will stop us!

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:30.930
[CHOPPER]
I'm sorry!

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:35.968
[CHOPPER crying]

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:44.376
So sorry that we didn't get here
sooner to save you from him!

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.681
[crying] Chopper.

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:53.485
[stammering] We can't die.

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:55.154
Please, Chopper.

00:15:55.187 --> 00:15:57.723
We don't wanna die here!

00:15:57.756 --> 00:16:00.826
Then it won't happen!
We'll find a way to save you!

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:03.062
[sobbing]

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:05.564
Caesar's strong,
he's powerful, devious,

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:08.667
and maybe the most horrible
man in the entire world.

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:11.403
But you should know something.

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:15.240
Our captain is better
than him and stronger.

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:16.642
As a matter of fact,

00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:18.811
he's gonna be
King of the Pirates someday!

00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:20.012
He can do it.

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:23.849
No matter what, Luffy is
going to take Caesar down!

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:26.151
[whimpers]

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:31.724
[CHOPPER]
So, please, listen carefully.

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:33.659
I think I have a plan.

00:16:33.692 --> 00:16:36.362
We can't let the other
children have any more candy.

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:38.530
Do you understand?

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:40.699
[MOCHA]
Mm-hm.

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:41.867
[CHOPPER]
I'm going to do my best

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.435
to get them all sedated here.

00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:45.371
That should make them
easier to control.

00:16:45.404 --> 00:16:46.538
[MOCHA]
Mm.

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:48.140
But I need your help.

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:49.875
Do you think you can
go to the Biscuit Room

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:52.211
and guard the candies there?

00:16:54.413 --> 00:16:55.681
Yes!

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:59.451
Whatever I have to do, I'll make
sure nobody eats anymore candy!

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:01.987
I want us all
to escape together!

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.889
Okay!

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:16.035
Mocha! [sobbing]

00:17:16.068 --> 00:17:17.903
I think she puked blood.

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:20.572
Why though? All she
did was eat the candy.

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:23.175
[CHOPPER grunts]

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:24.877
[gagging]

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.246
[CHOPPER grunts]

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:30.282
[choking]

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:33.185
What happened? Did she get hurt?

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:37.022
[DOLAN] Hey, she really
doesn't look good.

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.157
[NAMI]
I can't believe it.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.192
The children have stopped now.

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:41.026
[CHOPPER grunts]

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.227
[gagging]

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:43.962
[KONBU] That's what happens
when you're greedy.

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:50.102
[CHOPPER cries]
Mocha!

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:52.104
[sobs]

00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:54.406
I'm here! Stay with me!

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.776
[gasping]

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.044
What's wrong?

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:02.481
See now?! This is what eating
the candy really does to you!

00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:05.984
Do you get it?!
Mocha sacrificed herself...

00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:09.154
...for you! To save you!

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:11.290
Chopper! If you
wanna sedate them,

00:18:11.323 --> 00:18:12.958
then now is your best chance!

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:15.461
Mocha! First I have
to treat her!

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:16.695
No time, Chopper!

00:18:16.728 --> 00:18:17.463
[MOCHA gasping]

00:18:17.496 --> 00:18:18.964
[CHOPPER grunts]

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.402
[SANJI]
The children are standing still!

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:27.906
[SANJI]
Let's go!

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.343
[MARINES] Yeah!

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:35.614
[SANJI] No violence, boys!
Don't hurt anybody!

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:37.683
[MARINES]
Yeah!

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:40.185
Just subdue! Do not injure!

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:42.354
[MARINES]
Yeah!

00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:44.556
Get them under control!

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.192
[MARINES]
All right!

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:48.393
Hey, it's Sanji!

00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:49.495
And the Navy?

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:51.130
Sanji!

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:52.097
[MARINE A]
Black Leg!

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:55.067
Is aiming for the balls
considered violence?

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.369
[SANJI]
Hmm. A close call, but yes.

00:18:57.402 --> 00:18:58.070
[MARINE A]
Got it!

00:18:58.103 --> 00:18:59.938
Medical team, you're up!

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.039
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:04.476
Chopper, use these guys.
They know a thing or two.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.645
[CHOPPER gasps]
Mm.

00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:07.513
Right!

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:09.381
Let's get these
kiddos a little calmer.

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:11.250
Thank you, everybody!

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:12.885
[MARINES]
Ready...

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:14.553
Here we go!

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:16.722
If I'm correct, there should
be an examination room

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:17.956
somewhere around here.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.259
Let's get her there
as fast as we can!

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:21.493
[MARINE C]
We're running outta time.

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:22.794
You know that, right, raccoon?

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:23.896
[CHOPPER] Trust me, I know.

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:25.831
[MARINE D]
Enough chitchat. Let's move!

00:19:25.864 --> 00:19:27.432
[MARINES]
Yeah!

00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:31.136
[NAMI]
Mocha...

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:36.909
[MOCHA coughs]

[sobs]

00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:45.951
[CHOPPER]
Damn it! This is my fault.

00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:52.224
[MOCHA]
Chopper...

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:54.993
[CHOPPER gasps]
Mocha, are you okay?

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.229
Are you in pain?

00:19:57.262 --> 00:20:02.167
Chopper, I did it.
The others... [coughs]

00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:07.306
They're safe. I didn't
let them have the candy.

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:09.007
[gasps]

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:11.043
You-- Oh, Mocha.

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.481
You're so strong.

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:20.519
Eating the candy to save them--
that was brave.

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.487
It was so brave.

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:26.091
Thanks to you, they'll be
able to escape from here.

00:20:26.124 --> 00:20:27.926
[gasps]

00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:34.032
Mocha! I'm going to save you,
no matter what I have to do!

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:40.339
I swear I will! [cries]

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:45.677
You are going to grow up!

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.413
[MOCHA]
Mm.

00:20:55.287 --> 00:20:56.021
[SUBORDINATES yell]

00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:57.656
[SUBORDINATE A]
Look out!

00:21:00.525 --> 00:21:02.060
The dumpster exploded.

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.162
What the hell is down there?

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.366
[SUBORDINATES]
Huh?

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:11.370
[footsteps]

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:13.472
Stop! Now!

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:22.714
[SUBORDINATE B] It's Straw Hat
Luffy! What's he doing here?

00:21:22.748 --> 00:21:25.117
Shoot him! Fire!

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.232
Where's Caesar?

00:21:40.265 --> 00:21:42.868
[SUBORDINATE D gasping]

00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:45.871
[SUBORDINATE D]
Uhh... Huh?!

00:21:45.904 --> 00:21:48.573
Wait! I don't know anything!

00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:54.246
[LUFFY]
Where's Caesar?

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:57.082
Uhh, go straight
down this corridor.

00:21:57.115 --> 00:21:59.451
In Building R--he's there.

00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:00.452
Ugh.

00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:01.887
[LUFFY]
Good.

00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:09.328
I'm ready.

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:18.670
[NARRATOR]
In hopes of saving his men,

00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:20.939
Brownbeard attempts to
reveal what a heartless villian

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:22.641
Caesar Clown truly is,

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:24.710
but Caesar prevents the
truth from getting out

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:26.878
by stopping the captain
from speaking.

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:30.515
Then, upon hearing the uproar of
Caesar's victorious laughter,

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:32.250
Luffy explodes with anger.

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:34.086
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:38.023
"Browbeard in Grief!
Luffy Lands a Furious Blow!"

00:22:38.056 --> 00:22:40.792
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
