00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.171
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.141
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.910
Smiling, even as he stood
upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.079
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.247
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.348
You can have it!

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:18.151
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.387
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.322
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:26.393
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.554
[NARRATOR]
It's been two years

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:36.623
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:37.857
Scattered across the world,

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.792
Luffy and his crew
underwent special training

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.461
to prepare for the trials ahead.

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:43.796
Now, they return to the
Sabaody Archipelago

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.099
and move forward to next
stage of their journey:

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:48.067
The New World.

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.702
[ROBIN]
It's for a concert today.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:51.437
He's calling himself
"Soul King."

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:54.541
Yeah, there's a
story behind that.

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:57.110
He didn't say anything
about this to me,

00:02:57.143 --> 00:03:00.547
but he's makin' a lot of
people happy with his music.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.183
He might not wanna be
a pirate anymore.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:04.984
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.719
[FAKE SANJI] Look! It's that
kid with the backpack!

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:09.889
Maybe our luck ain't
so bad after all!

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:12.325
Oh, it's you guys.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:19.432
[PIRATES chattering]

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.240
[MARINE C]
Reporting from Grove 46.

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:28.741
All the new recruits
the Straw Hats

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.810
picked up are gathering here,
and from the looks of things,

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:33.279
I'd there might be nearly
a hundred of them.

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:35.615
There are four captains
here at least.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.599
[LUFFY]
"Big Guns Assembled!

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:55.335
The Danger of the
Fake Straw Hats!"

00:03:56.402 --> 00:04:00.406
[SOUL KING FANS cheering]

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:17.523
[cheering continues]

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:20.360
[BROOK]
Thank you!

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:23.029
Thank you, everybody!

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.633
All right! The wall!

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:29.836
[SOUL KING FANS]
Forty-five degrees!

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.508
Thank you for comin' out!

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.748
[BROOK] Now that is what
I'm talking about.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:42.749
[STAFF A]
Nice work, sir.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.017
[BROOK]
Hell yeah!

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:58.865
[BROOK]
Ahh... Like a rockstar, baby.

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:05.238
[BROOK]
Sinkin' down to my bones.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.116
[ringing]

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:23.356
This is Grove #46
with an update.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.857
The pirates keep pouring in.

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:27.060
There's definitely over
a hundred now.

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:31.631
None of the main Straw
Hats are here yet,

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:35.535
but even so, I would approach
with extreme caution.

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:36.636
[MARINE C gasps]

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.871
[MARINE C screams]

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:41.574
[MARINE A] Hey! What's wrong?
Did they find you?

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:43.643
[MARINE C screams]

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:46.446
This is bad! Tell the
backup they need to hurry!

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:50.283
Well now, what have we here?

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:52.785
Who is this little fellow
whispering behind the rock?

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.455
Because he looks
like a Navy soldier.

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:57.757
And my goodness, what is this?

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.594
You weren't looking to crash
our harmless party, were you?

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:11.137
No! No! That's not
very civil at all!

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.573
'Cause if you were calling
your friends for backup,

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:17.744
that would not end well,
seeing as they weren't invited.

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:19.812
Show some manners.

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:22.315
I saw him. He was calling.

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:24.584
No! I was going to
call them, but I...

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:26.786
...I-I hadn't gotten
through to them just yet.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.354
That is good to hear.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.123
And I say that for
your sake, too.

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:31.124
[CARIBOU laughs]

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:32.959
Because if your
friends did show up,

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:35.361
this grove would be
covered in blood.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:39.432
Their blood and your blood.

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.934
C'mon, Coribou.
Back me up here.

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:45.438
Huh? I wasn't listening!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:48.207
Who do you think you're bowing
to, moron? I'm over here!

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.109
[CORIBOU yelps]

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:51.778
Please, forgive me.

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:53.880
You still can't get it right!

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:56.382
What, are you blind
or just stupid?

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.851
[MARINE C]
He's famous for killing Marines.

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:16.235
[gasps]

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:20.006
[laughing]

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:24.143
[MARINE C screams]

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:27.647
Aww. Do you think
this is a joke?

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.215
He really stabbed that guy!

00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:31.250
Then the stories are true.

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:34.987
[CARIBOU]
Gods, have mercy!

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:39.425
He is but a fool!
He grabbed his gun!

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:44.096
This poor, misguided soul tried
to incite violence against me!

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.667
In your infinite kindness,
please show him mercy!

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.771
[CORIBOU] Sorry, gods.
Sorry. Very sorry. Sorry, gods.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.906
[CARIBOU]
Now, brother, bury him.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.509
Bury this sinful
transgressor alive.

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:59.212
Dig so that his poor
soul may be free.

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:00.012
[CORIBOU]
Roger!

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:01.380
Digging. Digging...

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:02.849
[MARINE C]
Wait a second.

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:05.852
What if I call them and
tell them not to come?

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:07.787
That would be good, right?

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.289
[FAKE LUFFY]
That's enough, Caribou.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.225
[CARIBOU]
Huh?

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:14.760
[FAKE LUFFY]
You can bury that nobody later.

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:17.196
We got bigger fish
to fry right now.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.598
[PIRATES cheering]

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:20.867
Just tell us what you want
from us, Captain Luffy!

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.301
We're ready to go!

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:25.771
[FAKE LUFFY]
Take a look around you, boys,

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:27.740
this is history in the making!

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:29.709
You probably don't
know each other yet,

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:32.111
but you'll be tight as
brothers soon enough.

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:34.981
From here on out,
you're Straw Hats!

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:38.050
[PIRATES cheering]

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:39.318
[FAKE LUFFY]
Not a bad deal.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.654
And I swear, when I become
King of the Pirates,

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:43.723
you're gonna know you
made the right call!

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.458
[PIRATES cheering]

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:47.760
But I need a promise
from ya first.

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:50.062
'Cause a real king
needs loyal subjects,

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.597
ones that will live
and die for him

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:53.266
and wait on him hand and foot!

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:56.502
Anything you say!

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.804
You're the man who
escaped Impel Down,

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:01.407
wrecked Enies Lobby,
stormed Marineford,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.242
and fought the Admirals!

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:05.778
You've got the World Government
quaking in its boots!

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:09.081
Sailing the seas with you
is like a dream come true!

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:11.918
Listen, there's only one man
fit to be King of the Pirates

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:13.586
and he's standing right there!

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:15.955
You get with him, or you
get left in the dust!

[LUFFY]
Is this it?

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.699
So where is everyone?
Stop makin' me wait!

[PIRATES cheering, laughing]

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.641
All right, enough!

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:39.445
I didn't call you here to party,
we got business to attend to.

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:42.014
Some jackasses out there
haven't been showin' me

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:43.616
the respect I deserve.

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:46.485
That is to say,
they insulted my honor!

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:51.457
A red-haired girl,
a long-nosed guy,

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.858
and a brat with a backpack.

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:54.627
Find 'em and bring 'em to me!

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.296
The bastards are still on
the archipelago somewhere!

Consider it done, boss!

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:02.602
[PIRATE I] We'll make
'em suffer! You'll see!

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:08.474
I gotta say, though, people sure
can change a lot in two years.

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:11.243
For one, you guys hardly
talk at all anymore.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.812
He's more dangerous
than we thought.

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:14.480
We gotta get him
to the boss pronto,

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:16.515
or he's gonna rat us
out to everyone.

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:17.817
Who is this guy?

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.585
I dunno, but in the meantime,

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.887
let's try not to talk
so he doesn't catch on.

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:25.324
The captain's right there, he
can figure this out on his own!

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:26.359
Sounds like a plan.

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:27.493
I dunno what happened,

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:30.129
but it seems like you're gettin'
along a lot better, too.

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:33.366
Yep. Time changes lots of stuff.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.067
[BOTH sigh]

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:36.669
Like your faces, I mean.

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:39.138
Unless you're wearing
a disguise like me.

Encore! Encore! Encore...

The Navy is here? So they know.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.065
Very well, then.

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:07.733
Take it easy! No pushing!

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:10.269
One more song, Soul King!
We're waiting for you!

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:12.071
I still need a moment more.

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.973
My fans are calling for
an encore, you see,

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:15.941
and I can't let them down.

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:23.582
I think I owe them
this much at least.

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:25.885
So please, wait up for me.

Those cheers could bring a dead
man back from his grave, baby.

Now listen, friends.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.222
I'm afraid that I've got
somethin' a bit heavy

00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:04.790
to share with you today.

This is the Navy! Nobody move!

What's the deal?
That's not cool!

[MARINE B] This is last living
member of the Rumbar Pirates,

the "Humming Swordsman" Brook,

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:29.815
presumed dead until now,
with a bounty of 33 million.

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:31.217
Despite his skeletal state,

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.520
our reports indicate that
Soul King is this pirate.

00:12:34.553 --> 00:12:36.322
In addition to his
previous crimes,

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:38.157
we have further information
that indicates

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.193
he is now working for
Straw Hat Luffy!

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:42.928
Soul King Brook,

00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:45.064
or rather, Humming
Swordsman Brook,

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:47.399
you're under arrest for piracy!

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:52.772
[SOUL KING FAN F]
No, it can't be true!

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:55.274
I feel like my
whole life is a lie.

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:56.842
[SOUL KING FAN M]
He was a pirate all along?

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.377
[SOUL KING FAN N]
But wait, Straw Hat Luffy's

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.579
been missing for years now.

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.749
[LONGARM BOSS] It's been a good
run, Brook, but it's over.

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:08.220
Your betrayal's not exactly
a surprise, Mr. Manager.

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:09.522
You're the one to blame,

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:12.258
telling me you were gonna
retire right after the show.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:14.193
How could you do this to me?

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:16.595
A pity, but it seems like
I would've been better off

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.465
keeping you in that
cage after all.

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:22.535
We were gonna be rich,
but now our company's ruined.

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:25.004
You're nothing but
a filthy traitor.

00:13:28.073 --> 00:13:29.809
[LONGARM BOSS]
If my life's going to hell,

00:13:29.842 --> 00:13:31.911
I'm taking you with me.

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:55.234
[CHOPPER]
That is so cool!

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:58.003
Heck yeah!

00:13:58.037 --> 00:14:00.606
Can I get a body like that, too?

00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:10.282
[CHOPPER] So, can you,
like, transform and stuff?

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:12.618
Shoot beams? Missiles?
Laser eyes?

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.520
Hurry! Show me! Show me!

00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:15.754
[FRANKY]
I carry the dreams of men

00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:18.090
on my massive, metal shoulders!

00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:34.406
I know he's cool! But stop
before you have a heart attack!

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:38.444
One thing's buggin' me, though.

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:40.713
Those giant robo-hands
are great for bashing,

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:42.915
but how're you supposed
to do detail work?

00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:46.619
Never doubt the master.

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:48.520
Whoa! Dude!

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.956
He's got a hand in his hand!

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.658
[USOPP, CHOPPER yelling]

00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:54.159
[NAMI]
Robin!

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:55.194
[NAMI chuckles]

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:58.330
Nami! I love the hair!

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.136
Wow, he looks terrible.
Did he do that to himself?

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:07.439
[ROBIN]
Heh. It's Franky. Don't ask.

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:11.076
[gasps] Whoa, this must
be the coating, huh?

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.979
Wanna see somethin'
else cool? Press my nose.

00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:15.047
Your nose?

Press and hold it,
for three seconds or--

00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:21.921
Apply pressure to the
nasal region, human.

00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:24.356

he's like a real robot!

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:37.169
Wait a sec. Can you style it?

00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:39.838
Ahh. Easy as pie!

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:46.211
Hey! Look who it is! What's up?

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:47.913
Yeah, I see you.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:50.616
Ugh. Like our crew didn't
stick out enough already.

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:53.352
Can I see your new
weapons, please? Can I?

[FRANKY grunting]

00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:59.358
Sorry, buddy, that's
the main event,

00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:01.560
so we gotta wait till
the captain shows up.

00:16:01.593 --> 00:16:02.361
Mecha.

00:16:02.394 --> 00:16:03.729
[CHOPPER]
He made robot noises!

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:05.564

Is "mecha" his new catchphrase?

[RAYLEIGH]
Hello there!

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:12.538
Hey, Rayleigh! Hey, Shakky!

00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:16.141
Sorry to interrupt your reunion,
but we've kinda got an incident.

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:18.077
Actually, two very
large incidents

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.944
that demand your attention.

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:24.016
Put the guitar down now!

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:27.987
Hands in the air, pirate!
There's no escape!

00:16:31.423 --> 00:16:33.625
[BROOK]
Members of the band...

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:35.627
My lovely chorus...

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.963
This will be my final song.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.165
Will you share it with me?

00:16:41.233 --> 00:16:43.369
[guitar plays]

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:45.137
Have no fear.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.974
My music has more than just
soul, it has true power.

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.409
Are you insane?

00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:53.345
You think anyone's gonna
let you play another song?

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:55.147
[BROOK]
You might not see it this way,

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.017
but I'm grateful for the
time we spent together.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.019
Thank you for these
past two years,

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:02.721
and thank you for
bringing me here.

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:06.158
My crew and I have rather
tragic memories of this place.

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:08.827
We lost an important
battle here last time,

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.330
but we're ready to start anew.

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:13.065
I'm the musician of the crew.

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:15.167
I may possess some strength
as a swordsman,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.937
but my job is to make
our journey more fun.

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.839
I've heard the stories.

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.908
They think people are
foolish enough to believe

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:24.910
that Straw Hat is dead.

00:17:24.943 --> 00:17:27.413
Well, you listen
to me. He's not.

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:30.416
Straw Hat Luffy is out there,
alive and kickin'!

00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:32.584
You can tell the world!

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:38.690
And while you're at it,
tell them he's going to be

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.959
the King of the Pirates
someday, too!

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:42.761
Boy, have I got some
news for you guys.

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:44.463
We better print this
one in a jiffy!

Yeah, baby, he's
comin' back soon,

00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:50.269
and when he sets sail, I wanna
send him off Soul King style!

[SOUL KING FANS gasp]

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.372

I'll dedicate this to my crew.

To my friends.

one last time! Yeah!

the New World. Together.

you're under arres--

is over, you bastards!

Hats were the real deal

00:22:16.234 --> 00:22:18.970
I gave Sanji a baby Transponder
Snail when he stopped by,

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:20.339
so I'll tell him to come back.

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:22.040
He should have Zoro
with him, too.

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:23.008
Good.

00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:25.510
We should hurry,
because any moment now,

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:28.580
the Navy will be attacking
with a sizable force.

00:22:28.613 --> 00:22:32.651
Unfortunately, there's no way
to contact your captain.

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:34.019
But if you follow
this Vivre card,

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:36.021
you should be able
to hunt him down.

00:22:36.054 --> 00:22:38.357
Let's hope the fake Straw
Hats buy you a bit of time.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.092
[RAYLEIGH]
Grove 42 is on the outskirts,

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:41.893
so it's close to the sea.

00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:43.829
Take the Sunny there
and be ready to depart

00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:45.397
on a moment's notice.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.166
I'm sure you'd like to relax
after these two difficult years,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.669
but it wasn't meant to be.

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:53.939
The winds of the New
World wait for no one.

00:23:15.827 --> 00:23:17.562
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats are
assembled on the Sunny

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:20.932
and ready to depart, but their
captain is still missing.

00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:23.034
As a battle breaks out
between the fake Straw Hats

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:26.037
and the Navy, Luffy
is drawn into the chaos.

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:28.573
Unable to keep a low
profile any longer,

00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:30.609
he shows the world the
strength he acquired

00:23:30.642 --> 00:23:32.544
in his two years of absence.

00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:34.212
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:37.582
"The Battle Is On! Show Them
What You Got From Training!"

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:39.951
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
