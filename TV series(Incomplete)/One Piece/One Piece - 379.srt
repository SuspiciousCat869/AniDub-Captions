00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,849
Once we travel the world,
we're comin' right back here!

346
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,767
Just wait for us!

347
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,483
[BROOK] I swear,
I will deliver this!

348
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,568
It holds the song
that Laboon, the captain,

349
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,445
and the entire crew loved!

350
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,198
I promised my comrades
I would take it to him.

351
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,741
It has the choral number
of a lifetime

352
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,910
that could make
crying children laugh!

353
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,371
Performed by the Rumbar Pirates!

354
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,872
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

355
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,874
"Binks' Brew:
The Song that Connects

356
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,668
the Past with the Present!"

357
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,962
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
