WEBVTT

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.218
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:20.353
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:23.490
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:26.426
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:35.398
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:38.301
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:42.605
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:42.638 --> 00:02:45.708
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body became rubber

00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:47.276
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.980
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:51.013 --> 00:02:55.118
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.288
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:02:59.322 --> 00:03:01.958
Luffy and his crew arrive
on the Fishman Island,

00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:04.260
which is located ten thousand
meters below sea level.

00:03:04.293 --> 00:03:08.764
There, they found themselves
facing the New Fishman Pirates,

00:03:08.798 --> 00:03:11.367
who were looking to
destroy the Ryugu Kingdom,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.036
and instigated an all out war.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.240
At the last moment, the Sea
Kings arrived to stop the Noah

00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:19.942
from crashing
into Fishman Island.

00:03:21.144 --> 00:03:23.779
Someone help!
I don't know what to do!

00:03:23.813 --> 00:03:28.384
He won't stop bleeding.
I'm afraid he's going to die!

00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:32.155
[JIMBEI] You can give
him some of my blood.

00:03:33.322 --> 00:03:37.126
It's type F.
Take as much as you need.

00:03:38.194 --> 00:03:39.929
[LUFFY]
Hey, Jimbei.

00:03:41.764 --> 00:03:44.033
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:45.334
[JIMBEI grunts]

00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:53.976
I would like you...
to join my crew!

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.548
[LUFFY]
"The Secret Revealed!

00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:01.417
The Truth about
the Ancient Weapon!"

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.056
[FISHMAN E] The royal
family's reached a decision!

00:04:09.358 --> 00:04:11.827
Free! We're finally free!

00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:13.296
[SLAVE A]
Screw you, Hordy!

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.598
Now who's in chains?

00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:17.333
[SLAVE E] I thought
I was goin' to be a slave

00:04:17.366 --> 00:04:18.668
for the rest of my life!

00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:20.169
[SLAVE F]
Thank you, Straw Hats!

00:04:20.203 --> 00:04:22.138
I swear, I'll repay you someday!

00:04:22.171 --> 00:04:24.473
After I become
King of the Pirates!

00:04:24.507 --> 00:04:25.441
[SLAVE G]
What?

00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:26.576
That's a bit ambitious.

00:04:26.609 --> 00:04:27.977
[SLAVE F] Hey, what's
wrong with havin' dreams?

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.178
[SLAVE B]
At long last!

00:04:29.212 --> 00:04:31.981
I can set sail
for the New World!

00:04:35.017 --> 00:04:36.319
Your Majesty.

00:04:36.352 --> 00:04:38.988
Are you sure it's wise to
release Hordy's human slaves?

00:04:39.021 --> 00:04:40.957
Not to question your judgment,

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.125
but the hatred they
have for Hordy...

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:44.827
They might turn
against all Fishmen.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.295
[NEPTUNE]
We can't let such fears

00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:48.130
turn us into
something we're not.

00:04:48.164 --> 00:04:50.132
This island has
always been a welcoming,

00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:52.301
safe place for pirates to rest.

00:04:52.335 --> 00:04:55.304
And these humans never
meant us any deliberate harm.

00:04:55.338 --> 00:04:57.607
We have no right
to imprison them.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.810
Now then, as for the rest
of the New Fishman Pirates,

00:05:00.843 --> 00:05:02.545
that's a different story.

00:05:02.578 --> 00:05:04.714
[whimpers] Don't
cut my head off!

00:05:04.747 --> 00:05:06.215
P-Please spare our lives!

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:07.817
Your Highness! Really!

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.186
We didn't know anything
about Hordy killing the Queen!

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:11.487
They lied to us!

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.456
We got duped by
a bunch of lunatics!

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:14.523
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE F]
That's the truth!

00:05:14.557 --> 00:05:15.791
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE G]
It's Hordy's fault!

00:05:15.825 --> 00:05:18.060
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE H]
We're not responsible!

00:05:18.094 --> 00:05:19.061
[NEPTUNE grunts]

00:05:19.095 --> 00:05:21.430
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES gasp]

00:05:21.464 --> 00:05:22.898
[NEPTUNE]
Hmm.

00:05:22.932 --> 00:05:28.070
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES gasping]

00:05:28.104 --> 00:05:29.905
[NEPTUNE]
From here on,

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:33.776
I officially order you all to
live here on the main island.

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:35.611
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
What?!

00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:38.681
Hang on! You're tellin' us
to live law-abiding lives?

00:05:38.714 --> 00:05:41.817
It could be a lot worse!
Better than working for Hordy!

00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:44.120
[FISHMAN E] C'mon,
you can't be serious, King!

00:05:44.153 --> 00:05:46.422
We don't want them
living among us!

00:05:46.455 --> 00:05:50.693
We won't feel safe to let our
kids walk down the street!

00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:52.094
[NEPTUNE]
To clarify,

00:05:52.128 --> 00:05:53.929
you will serve your
time, of course,

00:05:53.963 --> 00:05:56.732
and you will work under
the supervision of my army.

00:05:56.766 --> 00:05:59.135
I will provide you all
with gainful employment

00:05:59.168 --> 00:06:01.604
to use up all that
energy of yours.

00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:03.406
And from this day forward,

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:05.808
the Fishman District
will be sealed off

00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:08.744
and all entry prohibited!

00:06:09.812 --> 00:06:12.748
[NARRATOR] The dark side of
the Fishmen had been exposed,

00:06:12.782 --> 00:06:16.719
along with the true
killer of Queen Otohime.

00:06:16.752 --> 00:06:18.921
The conspirator, Hordy Jones,

00:06:18.954 --> 00:06:22.558
attempted to seize control
of Fishman Island.

00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:26.162
But he failed, all thanks
to a band of human pirates

00:06:26.195 --> 00:06:30.266
who happened to be passing
through at just the right time.

00:06:30.299 --> 00:06:34.303
[NEPTUNE] Hey, have you seen
Straw Hat Luffy around?

00:06:34.337 --> 00:06:37.239
Well, he, uh, absconded.

00:06:37.273 --> 00:06:39.542
[NEPTUNE grunts]
He fled?

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:51.887
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Why did you leave the plaza

00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:55.257
without saying anything?
Are you running away?

00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:57.159
We're not too big on attention.

00:06:57.193 --> 00:06:58.561
You saw how many spectators

00:06:58.594 --> 00:07:01.063
we had watching us
fight down there.

00:07:01.097 --> 00:07:03.399
If we stick around,
they'd just treat us like heroes

00:07:03.432 --> 00:07:04.934
or some dumb crap.

00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:07.937
Just the thought of
it makes me wanna puke.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.240
But why? Isn't it a good thing
be the hero of a nation?

00:07:11.273 --> 00:07:13.476
Listen up. I'll spell
it out for you.

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:17.713
A man who shares his saké with
other people, now that's a hero.

00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:19.782
But I want it all for myself!

00:07:19.815 --> 00:07:21.083
Keep your damn saké!

00:07:21.117 --> 00:07:23.185
And stop putting dumb
ideas in her head!

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:25.121
[LUFFY]
Why won't you join us, Jimbei?

00:07:25.154 --> 00:07:27.656
I know ya got adventure
in your blood! C'mon!

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.792
It'll be the most fun
you've ever had, I swear!

00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:32.395
[USOPP] He's right!
Crew up with us, Boss!

00:07:32.428 --> 00:07:35.197
It'd be awesome to have
a former Warlord with us!

00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:39.902
And helpful. Luffy could
take a little break!

00:07:39.935 --> 00:07:40.836
I told you.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.340
It's impossible for
me to join you now.

00:07:44.373 --> 00:07:45.975
But I am still grateful.

00:07:46.008 --> 00:07:48.577
It is an honor that you asked.

00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:51.347
I'm certain that it would
be the adventure of my life

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.850
to sail the sea with you all,
but I am afraid I don't have

00:07:54.884 --> 00:07:57.787
the luxury to indulge
in such pleasures.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.157
I have responsibilities
that I must fulfill,

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.827
and I've put them off
long enough as it is.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.530
Once I've seen to my duties,

00:08:07.563 --> 00:08:10.833
when I'm free from
my sworn obligations,

00:08:10.866 --> 00:08:13.702
I promise that I'll set
sail and seek you out,

00:08:13.736 --> 00:08:16.906
no matter where you may be.

00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:18.607
And if you haven't
changed your mind

00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:21.944
and still wish for me to
become a member of your crew,

00:08:21.977 --> 00:08:24.680
well, I'll gladly take
you up on your offer then,

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:26.415
if you see fit to have me.

00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:28.717
You better keep that promise!

00:08:33.155 --> 00:08:34.290
Whoa, hey.

00:08:34.323 --> 00:08:36.258
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

00:08:36.292 --> 00:08:38.260
Give him some time, Captain.

00:08:38.294 --> 00:08:40.262
He's really taken with Jimbei.

00:08:40.296 --> 00:08:42.164
[laughs]

00:08:42.198 --> 00:08:44.099
[USOPP chuckles]

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:48.441
[ZORO, NAMI chuckle]

00:08:48.475 --> 00:08:51.010
Luffy made it clear
you're worth the wait.

00:08:51.044 --> 00:08:52.745
So if you need some "me" time,

00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:54.314
you got it.

00:08:54.347 --> 00:08:57.283
[JIMBEI]
That is very gracious of you.

00:08:57.317 --> 00:08:59.085
So what're we doin' next?

00:08:59.118 --> 00:09:00.920
Where to? The New World, right?

00:09:00.954 --> 00:09:05.058
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps] What?
You're leaving just like that?

00:09:05.091 --> 00:09:06.826
I haven't thanked you properly!

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.027
It's not fair!

00:09:08.061 --> 00:09:10.230
Why, we've hardly spoken at all!

00:09:10.263 --> 00:09:12.365
Okay! It's settled, then!

00:09:12.398 --> 00:09:15.101
Let's stay at the
Mermaid Café a whole week!

00:09:15.134 --> 00:09:17.570
You got some kind of
nosebleed death wish?

00:09:17.604 --> 00:09:19.906
Sounds fun, though!

00:09:19.939 --> 00:09:21.741
[FISHMAN SOLDIER A]
Hey! Hold on!

00:09:21.774 --> 00:09:22.509
[NAMI]
Huh?

00:09:22.542 --> 00:09:23.676
Who's that?

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.912
Look like he must be a
soldier from Neptune's army.

00:09:25.945 --> 00:09:28.815
[FISHMAN SOLDIER A] Straw Hats!
Please wait just a moment!

00:09:28.848 --> 00:09:31.551
Okay, Your Majesty! They're
right here and listening.

00:09:31.584 --> 00:09:32.685
[NEPTUNE]
Well done.

00:09:32.719 --> 00:09:35.622
Luffy, my friend. Why did
you leave in such a rush?

00:09:35.655 --> 00:09:36.623
I wanted to thank you--

00:09:36.656 --> 00:09:39.058
I don't wanna be
treated like a damn hero!

00:09:39.092 --> 00:09:40.827
[NEPTUNE]
Yes, I can appreciate that.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.529
But at least let me
throw you the banquet

00:09:42.562 --> 00:09:45.031
that we originally set to enjoy.

00:09:45.064 --> 00:09:47.000
Banquet? Sure!

00:09:47.033 --> 00:09:48.668
We'll be right there!
I wanna eat some meat!

00:09:48.701 --> 00:09:51.404
What? Why did we
even bother leaving?

00:09:51.437 --> 00:09:52.372
Please, Nami.

00:09:52.405 --> 00:09:54.407
How could we possibly
refuse a feast?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.275
[LUFFY]
Yeah!

00:09:55.308 --> 00:09:57.443
Let's go pick up
Hachi and Camie!

00:10:04.284 --> 00:10:06.286
[NARRATOR] And with
Neptune's official decree,

00:10:06.319 --> 00:10:09.489
the Fishman District
was sealed off.

00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:12.692
[NARRATOR]
As for the fate of Hordy,

00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:16.129
his officers of the New Fishman
Pirates, and Vander Decken--

00:10:16.162 --> 00:10:19.332
They were all locked away
within the Prison Tower.

00:10:25.805 --> 00:10:29.309
Go for it, Kraken!
Take him far away!

00:10:29.342 --> 00:10:30.577
[FISHMAN SOLDIER C]
Wadatsumi!

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.545
You may not fit
into our prison cells,

00:10:32.579 --> 00:10:36.416
but you are forbidden from ever
entering this country again!

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.018
[FISHMAN A]
Did ya catch some?

00:10:39.052 --> 00:10:40.486
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.654
Good job, kids.

00:10:41.688 --> 00:10:44.123

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.280
[ROBIN] Which is to say,
more than 800 years ago.

00:20:51.313 --> 00:20:54.550
[NEPTUNE] The message you read,
he wrote to a mermaid princess

00:20:54.583 --> 00:20:58.020
who lived on this island
during that time period.

00:20:58.053 --> 00:21:00.222
It is a letter of
apology for failing

00:21:00.255 --> 00:21:02.891
to keep the promise
he made to this island.

00:21:02.925 --> 00:21:04.626
What promise?

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.130
[NEPTUNE] I'm afraid that I
don't know the specific details,

00:21:08.163 --> 00:21:10.732
but according to the legend,
it's said that somebody

00:21:10.766 --> 00:21:14.236
will come to fulfill it
someday on behalf of Joy Boy.

00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:16.672
At least, that's the story
that's been passed down

00:21:16.705 --> 00:21:18.507
through our royal family.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.443
And we firmly believe
that this day will come,

00:21:21.476 --> 00:21:24.880
so we've continued to look
after the Noah for generations,

00:21:24.913 --> 00:21:27.149
just as we promised him.

00:21:27.182 --> 00:21:28.584
And when the time arrives,

00:21:28.617 --> 00:21:31.486
the Noah will finally be
put to its intended use,

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.455
whatever that may be.

00:21:33.488 --> 00:21:35.357
[ROBIN]
I see now.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:36.858
I couldn't help
but overhear that

00:21:36.892 --> 00:21:39.461
the half-destroyed Noah
was taken to the Sea Forest

00:21:39.494 --> 00:21:41.997
after the battle
came to an end today--

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.433
by the Sea Kings, that is.

00:21:44.466 --> 00:21:47.269
If Joy Boy truly
planned to use the Noah,

00:21:47.302 --> 00:21:50.939
I have to wonder if he had
control of the Sea Kings.

00:21:50.973 --> 00:21:55.277
[NEPTUNE] No, it was actually
the former mermaid princess

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.346
who possessed
that fearsome power.

00:21:57.379 --> 00:21:59.047
[ROBIN]
That's what I thought.

00:21:59.081 --> 00:22:02.551
And now, Shirahoshi
has the same ability.

00:22:02.584 --> 00:22:05.587
[NEPTUNE]
She has for quite some time,

00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:09.257
but it seems that it did
not fully awaken until today.

00:22:10.325 --> 00:22:11.727
[NEPTUNE grunts]

00:22:18.233 --> 00:22:21.203
[NEPTUNE] I can't say
that I'm terribly pleased.

00:22:21.236 --> 00:22:23.038
[ROBIN]
I know how you feel.

00:22:23.071 --> 00:22:25.807
Two years ago, up in Shandora,

00:22:25.841 --> 00:22:29.544
I read a Poneglyph that located
one of the ancient weapons.

00:22:32.814 --> 00:22:36.318
All signs indicated
this very island.

00:22:36.351 --> 00:22:38.186
[NEPTUNE]
Mm...

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.921
[ROBIN]
This Mermaid Princess who lived

00:22:39.955 --> 00:22:42.424
during the same time as Joy Boy,

00:22:42.457 --> 00:22:46.028
she was known by another
name as well, wasn't she?

00:22:48.196 --> 00:22:51.800
And now, Shirahoshi
possesses the same power,

00:22:51.833 --> 00:22:55.070
so she will come to
inherit the same name, too.

00:22:57.472 --> 00:23:00.776
[ROBIN] A terrible thing
for a father to hear, but...

00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:07.949
...she is the ancient
weapon, Poseidon!

00:23:13.889 --> 00:23:16.324
[NARRATOR] Jimbei reveals
several surprises that occurred

00:23:16.358 --> 00:23:18.460
during the two years the
Straw Hats were split up.

00:23:18.493 --> 00:23:20.495
After Whitebeard's
death, his position as

00:23:20.529 --> 00:23:23.231
one of the Four Emperors
was filled by an old enemy.

00:23:23.265 --> 00:23:25.333
The Navy also underwent a change

00:23:25.367 --> 00:23:30.405
with a new leader emerging
after a violent struggle.

00:23:30.439 --> 00:23:32.474
Caribou plans some
trouble of his own.

00:23:32.507 --> 00:23:34.176
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.209 --> 00:23:35.744
"The Straw Hats Stunned!

00:23:35.777 --> 00:23:37.946
The New Fleet
Admiral of the Navy!"

00:23:37.979 --> 00:23:40.382
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
