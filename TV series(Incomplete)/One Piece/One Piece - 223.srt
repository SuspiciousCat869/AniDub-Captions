1
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,252
Talking about that
idiot in the straw hat?

2
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,687
I'm actually surprised
that someone

3
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,157
like Roronoa Zoro couldn't
see that man's strength.

4
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,326
See his strength?
What do you mean?

5
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,429
So, after hearing all that, you
wanna fight Luffy, don't you?

6
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,032
[DRIM chuckles]

7
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:17,004
Now I see.

8
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:20,341
What's up, Robin?
Did you find something?

9
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,310
I just determined the culprit
that stole your memories.

10
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,347
Consequently, it's not
the one we thought it was.

11
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,216
Wait a second, you mean
it's not that little brat?

12
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:33,420
Now, let's make our way
to the Sea God's Palace.

13
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,356
Sea God's Palace?

14
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,324
Okay, but why?

15
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,460
Eh-heh! Just a hunch.

16
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,442
[SANJI] So that little brat's
hideout is just up ahead?

17
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,543
[ROBIN]
That's right.

18
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,546
[LUFFY] Come on! Who's
the real thief here, Robin?

19
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,050
Isn't it about time you told us
about whoever's behind all this?

20
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,218
Everything will
become clear once

21
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,686
we reach the Sea God's Palace.

22
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,528
[thinking]
They're up to something.

23
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,297
They're gonna take me
deep into the jungle,

24
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,334
lock me up, and
then steal my gold!

25
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,769
Oh, no!

26
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,237
Is this place
really his hideout?

27
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,507
[CHOPPER] Seems
pretty peaceful to me.

28
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,712
[USOPP] That's what
he wants you to think!

29
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,513
Don't let your guard down!

30
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,551
I bet he has an army
of crazy monsters hiding

31
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,120
around here, just waiting
for a chance to pounce on us!

32
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,722
What?! Crazy monsters?!

33
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,791
Yeah. Monsters are known
to disguise themselves

34
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,627
to look like their
surroundings and then RAWR!

35
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,296
They sneak up, attack
you and gobble you whole!

36
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,564
That's right.

37
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,200
See, when you sail across the
seas as many times as I have,

38
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,635
you run into
plenty of monsters.

39
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,104
You become aware of
where they're likely to be.

40
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,607
Ah! Behind you! Look out!

41
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,810
Huh? What? Lemme guess.
"There's a monster behind you!"

42
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,478
That trick's not
gonna work on--

43
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,349
[CHOPPER and USOPP scream]

44
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,150
[USOPP] Get it off me!
Get it off me! Get it off me!

45
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,586
Please! You gotta do
something! Get it off me!

46
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,388
Get it off me!
Get it off me!

47
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,055
[NAMI]
Huh?

48
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,757
[SANJI] Hmm?
[LUFFY] Huh?

49
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,426
What are those two
doing back there?

50
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,098
[USOPP] Come back! It's
not a monster, it's a snake!

51
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,733
Get it off me!
Please! Somebody help me!

52
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,768
Get it off me! Get it off me!

53
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,452
Finally.

54
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,289
Hahahaha!

55
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:50,324
Guess I showed that
snake a thing or two!

56
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,826
It fled in terror from
the mighty Captain Usopp!

57
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,061
Hahahaha!

58
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,262
[CHOPPER]
Hey!

59
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,664
We got separated
from the others!

60
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,433
What are we gonna do
now, you stupid jerk!

61
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,167
[USOPP]
Eh...

62
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,169
Oh, crap!

63
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,637
Those crazy monsters
are gonna find us!

64
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,173
They're gonna
find us and eat us!

65
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,408
Oh, I wouldn't
worry too much.

66
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,676
I was just joking
around about that

67
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,644
and trying to scare
you a little bit.

68
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,447
I was only kidding, okay?

69
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,049
[sighs]

70
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,318
It was a joke. Good.

71
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,619
What are you trying to do, huh?!

72
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,153
Give me a heart atta--?!

73
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:22,790
[BOTH]
Ahhh!

74
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,425
Crazy monster!

75
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,027
But you said you were kidding!

76
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,697
Please don't eat
me, Mr. Monster!

77
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,199
Eat this delicious
raccoon-dog, instead!

78
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,804
Oh, it's just the swordsman.

79
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,105
Don't scare us like that, okay?

80
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:46,213
[thinking] Great, that
maniac decided to come back.

81
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,715
Wonderful.

82
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,817
He seems different, somehow.

83
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,619
He's not the same as
he was back on the ship.

84
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,761
[USOPP] So, I take you've
changed your mind, eh?

85
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,196
Well, if you agree
to straighten up

86
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,764
and swear your
loyalty to me,

87
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:04,731
I wouldn't mind bringing you on

88
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,268
as one of the great
Captain Usopp's crew.

89
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:10,170
Hey! Don't ignore me!
Where are you going?

90
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,272
[CHOPPER]
Wait! Please!

91
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:13,406
Can you tell us
where the others are?

92
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,144
[USOPP]
Whoa! Come back!

93
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:21,248
Don't leave me out
here all alone! [sobs]

94
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:32,159
[chuckles]

95
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:35,696
[USOPP]
Hey! Wait up!

96
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,664
Hm?

97
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,066
[USOPP]
Look who we found!

98
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,501
Hey! Zoro!

99
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,736
Oh, great.
It's the swordsman again.

100
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,111
Hmm?

101
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,081
Hold on.

102
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,685
[LUFFY]
Decide to rejoin us then?

103
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:58,586
Watch out!

104
00:06:58,619 --> 00:06:59,787
Be careful, Captain!

105
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,688
[LUFFY]
Huh? What's wrong?

106
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,733
AHHH! His head!

107
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:24,144
Close one. Hey Zoro, what
the heck did you do that for?

108
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,691
Stop it right now, both of you!

109
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,827
Wait, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

110
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,328
Something's wrong with him.

111
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,463
He's acting
completely different

112
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,331
than he was on the
ship yesterday.

113
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,133
[ROBIN]
Don't tell me he's...

114
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,235
[USOPP and CHOPPER]
Ahhh!!

115
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,115
That's kind of dangerous.
You should stop.

116
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,292
[NAMI] AHHH!
It's falling this way!

117
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,592
[SANJI]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

118
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,697
Where's that straw hat guy?

119
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:23,003
[LUFFY] Ugh!
You sure are being reckless.

120
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:31,344
So, uh I guess asking you to
stop is a waste of breath, huh?

121
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,682
What the heck is up with
that guy? He's pissed!

122
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,484
It looks to me like he's
under some form of hypnosis.

123
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,286
I bet that kid did it!

124
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,256
Well, that's a pain...
Right, listen up.

125
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,125
We all need to work together
and stop him, got it?

126
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,693
[LUFFY]
Stay out of it.

127
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:52,166
[LUFFY] You guys go on ahead.
I'll take care of him.

128
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,300
Huh?

129
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,507
Hmm...

130
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,544
[ROBIN] All right then.
Let's get going. Come on.

131
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:04,278
No way!

132
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,145
He's not really
gonna take on

133
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:08,816
Zoro the Pirate Hunter
all by himself?

134
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,451
In other words
no matter what.

135
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:13,387
Stopping him isn't gonna happen.

136
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,523
Right. Capturing that
boy is our priority.

137
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,725
We'll have to leave
this to the captain.

138
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,773
Gum-Gum...

139
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,645
...Pistol!

140
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,055
Is that how he's
gonna stop him?

141
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,190
I thought those
two were friends.

142
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,159
If someone were to get
hit with a punch like that,

143
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,461
it would probably kill them!

144
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:56,363
Because the
swordsman's his friend.

145
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,667
Because the captain knows
his opponents strength.

146
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,035
He knows he
cannot stop him

147
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,370
unless he fights with
everything he's got.

148
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,272
[thinking]
Everything he's got, huh?

149
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,674
I can't believe
I've been traveling

150
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,643
with such dangerous people!

151
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,780
[ROBIN]
Now, come on. Let's hurry.

152
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,448
[chuckles]

153
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:18,351
I'll leave everything in
your capable hands, Zoro.

154
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,393
Three-sword-style?!

155
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,602
Now Gum-Gum...

156
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,472
...Gatling!

157
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,729
[ZORO]
Oni Giri!

158
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,116
[thinking]
Hold on a minute!

159
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,218
Right here we have
a cook, a doctor,

160
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,588
a sniper, and me,
a navigator.

161
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:01,689
With that crew,

162
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,391
there'd be no problem
sailing the ship ourselves!

163
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,060
[NAMI]
Hey guys, wait.

164
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,331
Are you really
gonna go along

165
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:11,732
with whatever that
woman tells you?

166
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,334
She's a pirate, remember?

167
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,135
Hm?

168
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,636
[NAMI]
Pirates are all the same.

169
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,739
They're greedy, devious,
and sneaky low-lifes!

170
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,007
Don't you get it?

171
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,210
Luffy and this woman have been
lying to us from the beginning!

172
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,378
It's about time
you realized it!

173
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,516
Leave now and come with me.

174
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,652
If you do, I promise
to take you anywhere

175
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,353
in the world you wanna go!

176
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,257
You guys wanna go back home

177
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,325
to all of your family
and friends, don't you?

178
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,193
I know you do!

179
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:46,567
I feel the exact same way.

180
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,369
There's somewhere
that I have to return to.

181
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,172
[thinking]
Now that I think about it,

182
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,742
I have no idea where these
guys plan on taking me.

183
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,343
It might be safer if I travel

184
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,646
with her instead of
these freaks of nature.

185
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,654
You're right.
It's the same for me.

186
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,322
[NAMI]
See? See? See?

187
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,757
Then what's there
to think about?

188
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,524
Come on! Let's go!

189
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,262
I really can't blame you
for not putting your trust

190
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,065
in me since you've
lost your memory.

191
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,833
But, whether you
believe me or not,

192
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,402
I ask that you follow me.

193
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:22,736
Ah-ha! What'd I tell you!

194
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,771
Did you hear what she said?

195
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,340
She's lying to us!

196
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,576
[ROBIN]
Listen, we all have dreams

197
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:31,378
we want to fulfill on this sea.

198
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,680
Don't be so stupid!

199
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:34,615
People can't live just
sailing around the world,

200
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,217
chasing their dreams, and doing
whatever the hell they want!

201
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,619
Come on! Give me a break!

202
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:42,289
[ROBIN]
Maybe, but tell me something.

203
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,258
What could be more important
than chasing your dream?

204
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,130
"Let's chase our
dreams together.

205
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,334
Nothing in the world
is more fun than that!"

206
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:56,603
If our captain were here
now, that's what he'd say.

207
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:08,282
I'm... I'm gonna go
with Nami. Come on!

208
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,651
Let's all go back to our
homes! What do you say?

209
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,621
[CHOPPER] I'm... I'm
staying here with Luffy.

210
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:14,321
But why?

211
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:16,457
Because Luffy called me his...

212
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,427
He called me his friend and
accepted me just the way I am.

213
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,429
The exact same
way that Dr. Hiriluk

214
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,497
and Doctorine did before!

215
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:28,168
Either way. Be it go back
home or chase my dream.

216
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,437
There's something
I need to take care of.

217
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,773
I'm not gonna be satisfied
until I catch that brat

218
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:36,376
and teach him a lesson.
That's happening first.

219
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,216
I... I don't believe this.

220
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,784
And with that
matter being settled,

221
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,220
I'm going on ahead.

222
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:54,261
All right, you two. Shall we?

223
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,328
Aw, damn it all!

224
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,564
There's no point in going
home without my memory!

225
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,634
I gotta find some
way to get it back!

226
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,103
What? Hey! Wait!

227
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:11,478
Fine then! I'll just sail
outta this dump on my own!

228
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:12,779
My gold!

229
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:09,770
Three-sword-style. Ougi...

230
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,639
Now Gum-Gum...

231
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,620
...Bazoo-kaaa!

232
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,289
...3,000 Worlds!

233
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,502
[ROBIN] Sometimes strange
and unexplained things

234
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:45,039
happen here on
the Grand Line.

235
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:47,174
Things like sailors
being fine one minute

236
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,578
then suddenly losing their
memories during a voyage.

237
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:53,414
I'm sure you've both heard
stories like that before.

238
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,648
You think that same
sort of phenomenon

239
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,817
is happening on this island?

240
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,620
On that stone monument
we passed on the way here,

241
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:02,389
there was a story
inscribed about a monster

242
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,658
who lives off of
people's memories.

243
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,528
It said it's made
this island its home.

244
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:10,364
It's practically a legend,
but that is the explanation

245
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:13,434
that seems to
make the most sense.

246
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,703
Since new memories
are created every day,

247
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:17,705
this creature must be
consuming the memories

248
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:20,241
of the people of this
island little by little.

249
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:24,211
I see. So it's kind of
like raising a broiler.

250
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,148
[SANJI] I'm having a hard
time buying that story.

251
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,584
But either way, our missing
memories are at stake here.

252
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,519
We need to get to
the bottom of this.

253
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,054
[DRIM]
Stop right there!

254
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,422
[NAMI and USOPP]
Huh?

255
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,495
[NAMI and USOPP scream]

256
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:45,099
[DRIM] Pirates just don't know
when to quit, do they?

257
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,101
I'm gonna manipulate all of you,

258
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,036
just like I did that swordsman,

259
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,538
and have you
annihilate each other.

260
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,445
Oh, no!

261
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,283
Aaaaah!!

262
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:06,086
[NAMI] Get 'em off me!
What the heck is going on here?!

263
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:09,623
Looks like you'll be first.

264
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:12,593
It's not really my style
to kick a kid, but...

265
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:15,028
Wait! It's not the boy!

266
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:47,093
Where? How did?
What happened?

267
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,566
Somebody stole our memories.

268
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,467
Was it you?

269
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:02,275
Mr. Cook. That little boy
was just being manipulated.

270
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,447
The real thief here is--

271
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,758
[NOKO] Ooo!
Biboo! Biboo! Biboo!

272
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,227
[SANJI]
Hold it right there!

273
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,729
[NOKO scaredly]
Oooooo!!

274
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:23,230
If you think you're
leaving without giving back

275
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,633
every last memory
you stole from us,

276
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,235
you've got another
thing coming. Got it?

277
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:31,438
[angrily] Biboo boo!
Poo boo bo! BIBOO!

278
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,641
"Listen! I went
to a lot of trouble

279
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,209
to get all these memories.

280
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,378
I'm not giving
them back, you idiot!"

281
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,545
[SANJI]
What?!

282
00:19:39,747 --> 00:19:43,784
[ROBIN] The good Doctor can
understand what animals say.

283
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:46,787
Look, don't gimme any of
that crap, you stupid octopus!

284
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,790
[NOKO angrily] Biba!!
Boo boo! Ba ba ba BOOO!

285
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:51,759
"You ignorant jerk!
I'm not an octopus!

286
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:55,362
I'm a seahorse, got it?!"
That's what he said, not me.

287
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:58,498
It doesn't matter what
you are, you little thief!

288
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,203
Huh?

289
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,239
[USOPP]
Hey, It's you!

290
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:06,640
Ah! Hey, it's you!

291
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:10,277
[NOKO tiredly] Biboo...
Biboo... Bi boo boo boo...

292
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,079
Hurry up and cough up

293
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:14,515
the rest of our
memories or I'll fry you!

294
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,318
[NOKO]
Boooooooo!

295
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:19,719
Oo! Boo! Booo...

296
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:23,524
What the? What happened?

297
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,625
I'm not done with you yet!

298
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:30,030
[SANJI]
Not by a long shot!

299
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:36,570
[NAMI]
Sanji!

300
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:37,537
[USOPP]
My memories!

301
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:40,241
[CHOPPER] We got all
of our memories back!

302
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:41,442
[ROBIN]
Mr. Cook, what about you?

303
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:43,110
Of course I got them back!

304
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:45,746
My lovely Robin!
My stunning Nami!

305
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,648
You're both
breathtakingly beautiful

306
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,183
with or without my memories!

307
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:52,652
[SANJI]
But...

308
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,489
We don't know if that
moss-headed swordsman

309
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:57,725
got his memories back or not.

310
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:58,659
Yeah, you're right.

311
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:01,728
If he didn't, then
what are we gonna do?

312
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,132
[NAMI]
Zoro!

313
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:10,671
Where's Luffy?

314
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,339
Wait! You don't!

315
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,175
You don't think that
Zoro killed him, do you?

316
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:21,248
[NAMI]
No! It can't be!

317
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,688
What happened to the captain?

318
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,499
Now listen up!

319
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:40,401
If you plan on
hurting these ladies,

320
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:43,637
then you're gonna have
to go through me to do it.

BI BAH! BI BOOO!
