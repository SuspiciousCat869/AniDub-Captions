[cackles]

00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:31.717
My darkness
will swallow the world,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.255
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:36.125
You think I’ll lose to you?

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.262
I’m gonna be King
of the Pirates!

00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:42.805
Roger’s treasure belongs to me!

00:02:32.672 --> 00:02:35.210
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:35.244 --> 00:02:37.983
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:42.091
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:42.124 --> 00:02:44.495
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.800
became rubber after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:50.040
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:50.073 --> 00:02:54.281
I’m gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat

00:02:57.121 --> 00:02:59.258
one of the Four Emperors
of the New World,

00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:01.463
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:01.496 --> 00:03:02.565
Their current objective

00:03:02.598 --> 00:03:04.870
is to destroy a man-made
Devil Fruit Factory

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:06.540
in the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:06.574 --> 00:03:08.376
Luffy had intended
to win a tournament

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.748
that promised the Flame-Flame
fruit to the champion,

00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:14.188
but abandoned that plan when
Law was captured by Doflamingo.

00:03:14.221 --> 00:03:16.527
Now, he rushes to
the palace to save him.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.302
[USOPP] Special Attack...
Green Star Platanus!

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.744
I did it.

00:03:58.778 --> 00:04:01.650
All that's left is Sugar.

00:04:01.683 --> 00:04:03.721
I hate to beat up a little girl,

00:04:03.754 --> 00:04:06.760
but I don't think we're gonna
settle this over hopscotch.

00:04:06.793 --> 00:04:10.467
I have to get that Tatababasco
grape in her mouth somehow.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.278
You moron. I can't
believe you lost to him.

00:04:16.312 --> 00:04:19.251
Just die, Trebol, really.

00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:22.892
[TREBOL] I didn't lose!
And I'm not gonna die!

00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:26.432

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:41.162
[shrieks] This guy
is super creepy!

00:04:41.196 --> 00:04:44.468
Hey, y'know, you probably
would've survived

00:04:44.502 --> 00:04:46.405
if you had just
kept running away.

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:50.280
But since you bothered to come
back, you're dead. [chuckles]

00:04:50.313 --> 00:04:51.950
[gasps]

00:04:57.227 --> 00:04:58.363
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
There was a report that you were

00:04:58.396 --> 00:04:59.465
on the first floor, sir.

00:04:59.498 --> 00:05:01.636
[DOFLAMINGO]
Huh? What're you talking about?

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.908
[BUFFALO] Maybe it was
someone who looks like you?

00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:05.010
No biggie, right?

00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:07.549
[DOFLAMINGO]
Who the hell looks like me?

00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:09.318
Something's going on.

00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:11.322
[KYROS]
King Riku.

[KYROS grunts]

00:05:14.128 --> 00:05:15.998
[KYROS]
This is a fine sword.

00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:19.606
If I turn back into
a human, this will do.

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.244
[VIOLET grunts]
Straw Hat.

00:05:22.278 --> 00:05:25.083
My father was fighting
in the coliseum today.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.187
Uh? The old king?

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.557
[VIOLET]
He was spurred into action after

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.331
Doflamingo lied
about his abdication.

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:36.673
Today, I decided
to fight back, like him.

00:05:36.706 --> 00:05:38.710
[KYROS] King Riku was
fighting in the coliseum?

00:05:38.744 --> 00:05:43.119
[panting]

00:05:43.152 --> 00:05:44.756
[GUARD A] There was
a squabble in the slums;

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.825
two people are dead.

00:05:45.858 --> 00:05:47.596
The murderer is a teenage boy.

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:49.666
We have him surrounded!

00:05:51.201 --> 00:05:52.070
Nowhere to go!

00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:54.843

What's with this kid?

00:06:09.271 --> 00:06:10.575
This is bad. We might
have to open fire.

[KYROS growls]

00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:12.979

You can't shoot him!

00:06:13.012 --> 00:06:13.948
He's just a child!

00:06:13.981 --> 00:06:14.516
Yeah, but--

00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:15.818
[KYROS growls]

00:06:15.851 --> 00:06:17.053
[GUARDS gasp]

[GUARDS gasp]
King Riku?

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.867
My lord, wait!
He's far too dangerous!

00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:25.337
Stay away!

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.940
He might look like
some young punk,

00:06:26.974 --> 00:06:27.876
but he's known throughout

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:29.679
the whole kingdom
for his strength.

00:06:29.712 --> 00:06:31.950
I don't care if you're
the stinkin' king or not!

00:06:31.983 --> 00:06:36.425
Anyone who steps up to me is
going to suffer for it! [yells]

[GUARD J gasps]
But, my lord.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.917
I heard you were
in a terrible fight--

00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:53.459
that you were all on your own,
against dozens of angry thugs.

00:06:53.493 --> 00:06:58.002
And in the end, more than
half of them were badly injured.

00:06:58.036 --> 00:07:00.040
And two were killed.

00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:01.242
That's true.

00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:04.382
But they ganged up on my
best friend and murdered him.

00:07:04.415 --> 00:07:07.220
I was only taking revenge for
his death!

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:10.093
What are you, a beast?

00:07:10.126 --> 00:07:11.663
[KYROS]
Call me whatever you like!

00:07:11.696 --> 00:07:14.702
You haven't lived my life--
you don't know a damned thing!

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:18.978
My friend, he... was like
a brother to me, all right?

00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:27.228
He was the only
person I ever trusted.

00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:29.097
Kyros, was your name?

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.507
[growls]

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:37.213
[KYROS grunts, gasps]

00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:43.126
He could attack! Step away!

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.197
Be careful, my lord!

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.104

[MAN C] Teach that
little bastard a lesson!

00:08:11.817 --> 00:08:14.088
--[bell rings]
--[GYATS] And begin!

00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:16.492
[GLADIATOR A] Sorry, killer,
but those sword blades are blunt

00:08:16.526 --> 00:08:18.296
so that we don't
murder each other.

00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:19.464
That's not gonna stop me

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:22.370
from breaking some of
your bones, though! [grunts]

00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:28.382
[bell ringing]

00:08:28.416 --> 00:08:31.321
[GYATS] It's over in a flash!
The winner is Kyros!

00:08:31.355 --> 00:08:35.430
The teenage murderer
smashes heads and expectations!

00:08:35.463 --> 00:08:37.602
Get up and fight
me again! [yells]

00:08:37.636 --> 00:08:39.171
That's enough! Stop!

00:08:39.204 --> 00:08:40.774
That's true skill!

00:08:40.807 --> 00:08:44.081
If his blade wasn't blunt,
he would've killed that man!

00:08:44.115 --> 00:08:47.253
I'd call it savagery,
but here, it's "skill."

00:08:51.028 --> 00:08:52.932
[DOLDO]
How is Kyros doing?

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:54.001
[GUARD CAPTAIN A]
He nearly killed

00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:56.507
all the convict gladiators
he was held with.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.875
He hasn't eaten for six days

00:08:57.909 --> 00:09:01.583
and keeps shouting "Call
King Riku!" again and again.

00:09:01.617 --> 00:09:03.754

[KYROS] King Riku! What the
hell are you trying to pull?!

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:12.905
If you're going to execute me,
then do it already!

00:09:12.939 --> 00:09:16.278
You can shoot me or hang me
or whatever you like!

00:09:17.816 --> 00:09:19.987
Do you truly want to die?

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.390
Or is this just regret?

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:25.297
Regret? I was foolish to
think you understood me.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.735
If you just brought me
here to suffer, then kill me!

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:30.206
Let me die, damn it!

00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:32.311
[DOLDO] The gladiatorial
contest that you fought in

00:09:32.344 --> 00:09:34.683
was not some meaningless
display of carnage

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:36.185
nor was it a punishment.

00:09:36.218 --> 00:09:38.957
Rather, it is a tradition that
has continued for centuries.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.326
A sacred event,
in which fighters

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.034
discipline their mind
and hone their spirit.

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:47.474
I think you'd
make a fine gladiator.

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:50.046
A gladiator? Really?

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.484
[GUARD CAPTAIN A] King Riku is
willing to release you on parole

00:09:52.518 --> 00:09:54.523
if you're able to
win 100 matches.

Even if it takes years,

00:09:55.791 --> 00:09:57.427
that's how you may
earn your freedom.

[GYATS] One hundred consecutive

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:35.470
Even our strongest gladiators
fell before the might of Kyros!

00:10:35.504 --> 00:10:36.607
It's hard to believe,

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.512
but he's won his
freedom in no time at all!

00:10:39.545 --> 00:10:41.482
He's too strong. That's crazy!

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:42.450
That killer doesn't
deserve to be free!

00:10:42.484 --> 00:10:44.488
Huh?

Hey!

00:10:45.256 --> 00:10:46.527
Come on! Think about it!

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.795
If they let him out of here,

00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:51.402
then what's going to stop
that monster from killing again?

00:10:51.435 --> 00:10:53.406
She's right.

00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:54.709
[CROWD shouting]

00:10:54.742 --> 00:10:56.880
[MAN H] Yeah! I don't want that
guy anywhere near my family!

00:10:56.914 --> 00:10:58.784

You can't set him free!

00:10:58.818 --> 00:11:02.190

00:11:08.503 --> 00:11:10.073
[DOLDO]
You're going to stay here?

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:13.112
[KYROS]
I can't go where I'm not wanted.

00:11:13.146 --> 00:11:15.016
Hm. That's strange.

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:17.821
You care about other people's
opinion all of a sudden?

00:11:17.855 --> 00:11:19.424
[KYROS]
Shut up!

00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:26.071
[KYROS]
I should've known.

00:11:26.104 --> 00:11:30.948
People only like beasts as
long as they stay in a cage.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:37.695
Wherever I go, there's no place
in this world where I belong!

00:11:37.729 --> 00:11:39.264
If that's what they want,

00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:42.805
I'll fight and
die like an animal!

Make him pay!

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:05.551
[GYATS]
Three hundred victories!

00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:07.855
The heroes line up
one after another,

00:12:07.888 --> 00:12:10.794
but Kyros cuts
them down to size!

00:12:10.827 --> 00:12:15.036
[CROWD cheers]

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:16.673
[GYATS]
Unbelievable!

00:12:16.707 --> 00:12:22.317
We're witnessing an
unprecedented 1,000th victory!

00:12:22.351 --> 00:12:23.085
[WOMEN]
Go, Kyros!

00:12:23.119 --> 00:12:25.456
Nice work! You're awesome!

00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:30.166
[KYROS]
Before I knew it,

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.074
the ire of the crowd had
transformed into adoration.

00:12:34.108 --> 00:12:37.748
And yet, I could
still find no peace.

00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:40.921
[KYROS groaning]

00:12:57.722 --> 00:13:01.763
[KYROS gasps, panting]

00:13:19.364 --> 00:13:21.202
[DOLDO]
Here again, Kyros?

00:13:21.235 --> 00:13:22.036
Listen.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.041
[KYROS]
Go away!

00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:26.379
Don't you understand?

00:13:26.412 --> 00:13:28.551
No matter where I go,

00:13:28.584 --> 00:13:31.923
for the rest of my
life, I'll be a beast.

00:13:31.956 --> 00:13:33.994
A murderer!

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.992
I wish... this world...

00:13:50.026 --> 00:13:52.664
...would forget about me!

[KYROS, DOLDO grunt]

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.664
[GYATS]
The mysterious masked man,

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:28.369
known only as "Ricky,"
has climbed the ranks

00:14:28.402 --> 00:14:30.373
to do battle with our champion!

00:14:30.406 --> 00:14:32.477
[MAN M]
You got this, Kyros!

00:14:33.312 --> 00:14:34.314
[DOLDO grunts]

00:14:34.347 --> 00:14:36.953
[GYATS] On the brink
of his 3,000th victory,

00:14:36.986 --> 00:14:39.759
Kyros seems all but
unstoppable, and yet,

00:14:39.792 --> 00:14:42.130
Ricky refuses to
submit to defeat!

00:14:42.163 --> 00:14:43.332
[gasps]

00:14:45.002 --> 00:14:47.107
[GYATS]
You don't see that every day!

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.413
Ricky lands a clean hit
on the mighty Kyros!

00:14:50.446 --> 00:14:52.784
Actually, this is
the first time anyone

00:14:52.818 --> 00:14:56.926
has landed a clean hit on Kyros
in his entire tenure here!

00:14:56.959 --> 00:14:57.995
[DOLDO groans]

00:14:58.028 --> 00:14:59.465
--[bell ringing]
--[GYATS] And it's over!

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:01.368
Kyros continues his streak!

00:15:01.402 --> 00:15:02.739
Three thousand battles and

00:15:02.772 --> 00:15:05.310
three thousand
victories over nine years!

00:15:05.343 --> 00:15:06.880
He's a living legend!

00:15:06.913 --> 00:15:08.817
You might even say
the word "invincible"

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.490
was invented to
describe this man!

00:15:12.524 --> 00:15:15.496
Damn it. You're the
leader of this kingdom!

00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:17.266
Riku, why?

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.770
[DOLDO]
I became quite strong

00:15:18.804 --> 00:15:21.408
after training
with you, didn't I?

00:15:21.442 --> 00:15:22.578
But you lowered your guard

00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:25.684
as soon as you
noticed it was me.

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:28.155
You're not such
a beast after all.

00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:33.199
[DOLDO]
You've punished yourself enough.

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:35.670
It's already been nine years.

00:15:35.704 --> 00:15:39.745
Nearly a decade of your life,
locked away in this cage.

00:15:39.778 --> 00:15:41.583
[KYROS gasps]

00:15:41.616 --> 00:15:43.854
[DOLDO] There's something
important I need you to do

00:15:43.887 --> 00:15:47.226
on the outside, Kyros.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.032
Rather than regretting the lives
that you took in the past,

00:15:50.066 --> 00:15:53.406
you should devote yourself
to saving lives in the future.

00:15:53.439 --> 00:15:57.246
I think you can
find meaning in that.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.884
Yes, sir!

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:03.927

for all your hard work!

Kyros! Protect me!

00:16:18.857 --> 00:16:21.194
We love you!

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:27.541
Captain Kyros, so popular
with the ladies!

00:16:27.575 --> 00:16:30.146
But I haven't forgotten
that you're a killer!

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.214
Honestly!

00:16:31.248 --> 00:16:33.887
Father shouldn't allow
you inside the palace.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.423
I object to it!

00:16:35.456 --> 00:16:36.726
[BOTH]
Please, Princess Scarlet!

00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:39.832
That's cruel! Stop it!
Digging up his old trauma!

00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:41.636
[SCARLET] The captain
of the guard is supposed to

00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:44.274
be a symbol of
righteousness, not this.

00:16:44.308 --> 00:16:45.610
[VIOLET]
Scarlet!

00:16:45.644 --> 00:16:47.915
[SCARLET] Even if you can
fool the rest of the kingdom,

00:16:47.948 --> 00:16:49.384
you'll never fool me!

00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:51.656
You'll show your
true colors soon enough!

00:16:51.689 --> 00:16:54.494
Don't you dare lay a finger
on me or my sister.

00:16:54.528 --> 00:16:58.202
You keep your
distance. Understand?

00:16:58.235 --> 00:16:59.204
[KYROS grunts]

00:16:59.237 --> 00:16:59.805
Huh. I dunno.

He's not like that.

00:17:01.342 --> 00:17:03.814
[SCARLET]
Stop it! You shouldn't look!

00:17:03.847 --> 00:17:05.717
His mind's probably filthy!

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.623
But... my job is
to... protect you!

00:17:08.656 --> 00:17:09.692

Don't touch me!

Oh-ho! No use strugglin'.
No one's gonna save you.

I bet her daddy's scared.
Let's send him a ransom notice.

I'm sure he'll
cough it up real quick!

You want to resign
as the royal bodyguard?!

This is rather sudden,
don't you think?

Uh, well, I--

Don't tell me you've fallen
in love with Princess Scarlet!

Hero of the coliseum
and captain of the guards,

00:20:05.342 --> 00:20:07.314
married to the eldest princess.

00:20:07.347 --> 00:20:08.048
My word.

00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:09.384
The people would certainly

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:12.356
celebrate such a union
in private at least.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.461
But because of your past,

00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:17.534
it would be condemned,
I'm certain of it.

We're royalty.

I would rather die!

have, you lout!

00:22:19.778 --> 00:22:23.385
One filled with so much love.

00:22:23.418 --> 00:22:26.559
[SCARLET]
Uh? Be careful!

00:22:28.362 --> 00:22:32.136
[KYROS] Unfortunately,
that joy was all too brief.

00:22:35.109 --> 00:22:37.179
[SCARLET chuckles]

00:22:37.213 --> 00:22:40.452
[KYROS]
It's already been ten years.

00:22:50.306 --> 00:22:52.911
A fire? What happened?

00:22:55.182 --> 00:22:56.852
[growls]

00:22:59.525 --> 00:23:01.762
[growls]

00:23:04.401 --> 00:23:06.271
King Riku.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.991
[NARRATOR]
Ten years ago, Kyros,

00:23:16.024 --> 00:23:18.162
now only known as
the Toy Soldier,

00:23:18.195 --> 00:23:21.034
was tragically torn away
from his loved ones.

00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:23.405
In order to restore
the gladiator's humanity,

00:23:23.438 --> 00:23:25.811
Usopp begins a desperate
battle with Trebol,

00:23:25.844 --> 00:23:29.551
but it may take a miracle if
he wants to make it out alive.

00:23:29.585 --> 00:23:31.321
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.355 --> 00:23:35.062
"The Operation Failed!
Usoland the Hero Dies?!"

00:23:35.095 --> 00:23:38.034
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
