1
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:37,391
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:40,728
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:44,565
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:49,536
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:51,739
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:52,840
You can have it!

7
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:56,277
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,679
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:02,116
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:05,352
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,555
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,395
Bastard... you
taking this seriously?

13
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:17,197
Of course! I'm
quite impressed...!

14
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:20,233
But you said you were
in a hurry... didn't you?

15
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,404
My new power should
speed things up for you.

16
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,375
What's going on?!

17
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,446
Damn...! I was trying to
use my man-beast form,

18
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,215
but I messed up on the man part!

19
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:39,185
There's a talking giraffe
falling through the ceiling!

20
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,623
Your... power is so
awesome... I love it!

21
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,626
A wolf...?! What the...

22
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,628
Is this place some kinda zoo?!

23
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,563
You're going to pay for this!

24
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,498
You're all going to pay!

25
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,602
I'll show you the power
of my devil fruit...

26
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,336
Then you'll be sorry!

27
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,272
Tempest Kick...

28
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,413
Oh boy...he's mad now!

29
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,216
Sky Slicer!

30
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,588
This isn't good.

31
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,122
Usopp, get down!

32
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,145
"I Won't Kick, Even
If It Costs Me My Life!

33
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,713
Sanji's Chivalry!"

34
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,494
I see...

35
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:56,530
That long neck has
improved your reach.

36
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,533
The centrifugal force coming

37
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,436
from a body that size
makes for a very fast...

38
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,471
and very deadly attack.

39
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:08,742
W-wait a sec.

40
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,711
It doesn't look like
he cut anything to me.

41
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,146
Try taking a
look at the ceiling.

42
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:18,084
Huh...? The ceiling...?
All I can see is the sky.

43
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,156
The sky...?
But that must mean...

44
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,295
He... he just cut the Tower
of Law in half, didn't he?!

45
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,098
It's slidingggg!

46
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,535
Hmph... You should be ashamed...

47
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,705
A professional doesn't let his
emotions get the better of him.

48
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:38,939
I don't want to
hear it anymore...

49
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:43,677
For the last time, giraffes
are awesome... I love giraffes.

50
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,380
Fine... whatever you say, man.

51
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,615
Humph... You can show off

52
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,617
all you want-doesn't
matter to me...

53
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,785
I came here expecting a fight...

54
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,754
your powers don't
scare me one bit.

55
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:57,725
H-hey! Cut it out,
Zoro! That hurts!

56
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,093
What're you doing...?!

57
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,061
Why are you pulling
my arm like that?!

58
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,130
Wait... My arm...

59
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,307
Whoa... that's not coming off.

60
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,775
Nope. Don't think so.

61
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,579
What the hell did you do?!

62
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,648
I swear, this is not my fault!

63
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,149
If you hadn't tackled
me back there,

64
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,517
this never would've happened!

65
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,119
You were about to
get your head lopped off

66
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,553
and you're blaming
this on me...?!

67
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,589
You trying to get us
both killed, or what?

68
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:29,757
If you don't get me
out of these things,

69
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,760
I'm using you as a shield
the next time he attacks...

70
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,528
Now they're completely
ignoring us...

71
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,496
What happened?

72
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,397
Fix this mess...!

73
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:36,831
You fix it!

74
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:37,665
It's your fault!

75
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,767
Okay, okay let's
think about this...

76
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,636
In short... we're in the same
situation as Robin, right?

77
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,470
Right?

78
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,504
Then, to get the key...

79
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,607
We're gonna have to
fight them and take it...

80
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,442
So nothing has changed, really.

81
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,710
Being handcuffed to someone

82
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,679
is just business
as usual, then?!

83
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,148
Damn, I guess
they're stuck together.

84
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,616
Fine... Then it's settled...

85
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,118
I'll put those two idiots
out of their misery...

86
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,687
You stand over here and watch.

87
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,355
What...?! Screw you...!

88
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,757
I'm not letting you steal
my prey, you bastard!

89
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,492
Our only other option
is working together

90
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,828
and I know you don't want that.

91
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,464
Oh, hell no.

92
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,398
That's how I feel.

93
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,800
Hey! You guys!

94
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,336
Can you check the
number on those handcuffs?

95
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,670
Number?

96
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,505
Each pair of
handcuffs and each key

97
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,140
is marked with a
matching number...

98
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,107
Otherwise, we wouldn't know

99
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,711
which key we'd need
to use to unlock them.

100
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,746
At any rate, if either
of us have the key

101
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,282
to those handcuffs we'll unlock
them for you.

102
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,817
Oh! Okay, thanks...!

103
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,719
Let's see, where is it...

104
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,621
Here! It's number 2! Unlock us!

105
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,625
Nope, not mine.

106
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:40,427
It's not mine, either...
That's a shame.

107
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,630
Damn it! Then don't get
our hopes up like that!

108
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,232
Even if we ran away,
it's not like

109
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,701
we could fight the rest
of CP9 in this state.

110
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,104
That settles it, then...

111
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,306
Guess it's
first-come-first kill.

112
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,341
That's only fair, I suppose.

113
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,314
Crap!

114
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,691
That's weird...
what happened...?!

115
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,260
The stairs are all split up!

116
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,531
I should've known...

117
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,834
It must've been that
big rumble I felt earlier...

118
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,236
Whoever's fighting
sure must be tough!

119
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,648
Hey, are you guys okay in there?

120
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,725
Zoro...! Sniper King!

121
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,330
Hey! Chopper!

122
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,599
Huh...? What's going on?

123
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:54,734
They've waving at me...
Maybe it's a game?

124
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,171
Yay!

125
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:01,809
Handcuffs!

126
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,477
We're stuck together, stupid!

127
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,145
If you can't find
key number two,

128
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,647
they're gonna murder us!

129
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,149
Oh... okay.

130
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,424
What the hell is this...?

131
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:21,061
I kinda figured there'd be
a bridge here or something.

132
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:25,466
Man, those whirlpools
are really huge...!

133
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,534
I can see the Gates
of Justice from here...

134
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,337
but I don't know if
I can get there on a boat.

135
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,473
I don't have time to
stand here and think...

136
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,408
I gotta give it a shot at least!

137
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:38,712
Here goes nothing!
I'm on my way, Robin!

138
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,417
Whee...! Yay!

139
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,419
I found a secret way
to get to the gates...!

140
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:49,189
I'm gonna tell the pirates
and then they'll save the day!

141
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,598
Huh? What's this...?

142
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:14,080
That's awful fishy...
Could it be...?

143
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,218
Click.

144
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,123
What's going on?!

145
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:34,334
All right! We found
another secret passage!

146
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:42,209
Pow...! Where are we now?

147
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,618
Whoa...! Are you okay,
Pirate Guy?

148
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,186
You're not looking so good!

149
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:59,727
I get it... So the keys
and the handcuffs

150
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,928
have matching numbers on them.

151
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:04,598
If you can't fight, then that's
okay-I didn't find anyone,

152
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,567
so I can just beat
these guys for you.

153
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,203
Sorry, but there's no way
in hell that's gonna happen-

154
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,372
and besides, if you get taken
out, we'll still be stuck

155
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:13,607
in these handcuffs
with no way to fight.

156
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,509
Please! We're counting on you!

157
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,044
You're our only hope!

158
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,145
Only hope...?

159
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,047
Flattery doesn't work on
me at all, you big dummies!

160
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,183
Between Sanji, Nami and Franky,

161
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,252
someone has to have the #2 key.

162
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,820
Get it, and bring it here.

163
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,655
Hurry, okay?!

164
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:31,759
Hmm... If anyone
has a key already...

165
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,727
it's probably Sanji.

166
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:39,199
I've gotta find him...
I'm their only hope!

167
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:58,285
Yooooo...! I've... caught...
you... now... girl!

168
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,053
Let go...

169
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:10,497
Yoyoi...! You... are...
far... too... weak!

170
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,567
Now perish!

171
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,743
I'm no match for him at all!

172
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,282
Franky...

173
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,286
Iron Body!

174
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,587
Boxing!

175
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,493
Shave!

176
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,232
Why are your
punches so strong...?

177
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,468
Wait -You're not human, are you?

178
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,136
It's cute how you CP9 guys

179
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,105
can make your
bodies hard like iron...

180
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:54,541
but these fists of mine are
the genuine article, brother.

181
00:12:58,312 --> 00:12:59,246
What am I doing...?!

182
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,716
This is no time for me
to be drinking tea!

183
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:07,087
Witchcraft...! You put
me under a spell...!

184
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,756
One more sip and
I'd be finished...!

185
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:12,092
Damn it! I almost got
captured in your love trap!

186
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,529
So you say, after three cups.

187
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,564
Shut up, you witch!

188
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,800
Don't you dare play
innocent with me!

189
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,536
I haven't forgotten what
happened on the Sea Train...

190
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,405
I won't forgive the way
you people treated Robin!

191
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:34,481
Now... Give me your key.

192
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:37,785
What a shame...

193
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,820
It seems you're in a hurry.

194
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:42,189
Well, I won't keep you...

195
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,324
If you want the
key then take it.

196
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:48,228
So where is it?

197
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,064
Who knows...?

198
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:52,132
You'll have to search my body...

199
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,635
And find out for yourself.

200
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,603
Think you're up to it?

201
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,174
You bet I am!

202
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,514
You are off to a bad start.

203
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:10,217
Damn... that was stupid...

204
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,810
Might I remind you...
Even as we speak...

205
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,113
your friend Nico Robin
is drawing closer

206
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:41,048
to the Gates of Justice.

207
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,350
Although in her case
"closer to hell" is

208
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,220
probably a more accurate
way of putting it.

209
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:49,089
Yeah, fine, I get it already-I'm
screwing around in here,

210
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,458
while Robin's life
is on the line.

211
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,093
But I'm warning you,

212
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,396
I won't make the
same mistake twice.

213
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,398
I don't care if
you're a woman...

214
00:14:57,431 --> 00:15:00,200
If you don't give me that key,
you're gonna get hurt.

215
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:05,372
We've gone from sweet talk
to petty threats, have we?

216
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:09,209
Do you think I care if you treat
me like a woman or not...?

217
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,279
I'm an assassin...
A professional.

218
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,548
Keep your chivalry.

219
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,816
I've been ordered
to take your life

220
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:20,120
and that's exactly what I'll do.

221
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,695
Take my life, huh...?

222
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:30,164
'Fraid that's not gonna work.

223
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,332
'Cause I'm not leaving here

224
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:33,500
without the key to
those handcuffs.

225
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,203
I suppose tea
time is over, then.

226
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,208
Shave!

227
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,616
You CP9 folks are every
bit as strong as you say.

228
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:05,265
Got you!

229
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,405
Score one point for me.

230
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,719
You... How could you?!

231
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:29,189
Sorry, but... that's how you
score a point.

232
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:33,427
You're gonna...
pay for that one.

233
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,028
Moon Walk!

234
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,588
He's fast!

235
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:04,658
There. It's over--you're
pinned to the ground...

236
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,694
I beat you fair and square...
now give me the key!

237
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,796
Finger Pistol!

238
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,202
Tempest Kick!

239
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,275
What a sad little man...

240
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,511
You call yourself a pirate...?

241
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,114
You're afraid to even touch me.

242
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:31,184
Hey... you shut up...!
Give me the damn key!

243
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,756
I've had enough of your
empty threats, you coward.

244
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:43,797
I'm growing bored,
so let's try something new...

245
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:48,001
If you can't withstand this
attack... you won't survive.

246
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,042
He's not coming after me...

247
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,283
I was lucky enough
to get away once.

248
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:04,318
I'd be dead for
sure, next time...

249
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:07,721
I need to find the others...
before he finds me.

250
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:10,190
Life Return!

251
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:16,429
Yoyoi! Yoi! Yoi! Yoyoi!

252
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,165
Damn...

253
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:23,537
Let's... see...
what... comes next...?

254
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,806
Shall I pierce thee to death...

255
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,209
or choke thee to death?

256
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:33,380
A fragile life... a wintry wind.

257
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:36,483
Now... before spring can come...

258
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:40,287
a flower succumbs...
to the cold.

259
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:47,795
But in its end...
let it bloom in red...

260
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:52,633
if only for an instant...
This is my compassion...

261
00:18:52,666 --> 00:19:00,640
as the petals
gently fall...! Yooooo!

262
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,211
A final request...

263
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,280
When you reach the other side...

264
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,315
I ask that you deliver a message

265
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,318
to my poor, deceased mother.

266
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,420
Let her know that I am well...

267
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:17,424
and that my killer's
instinct is as strong as ever!

268
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:25,332
Now die... Die! Die! Die!

269
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:26,233
No!

270
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:31,772
Song of Spring Feelings!

271
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:35,108
Cloven... Roseo!

272
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,388
Nami! Are you okay?!

273
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:53,593
I'm fine...
Thank you for saving me.

274
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:55,596
Did he eat a Devil Fruit...?

275
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,531
What's up with his hair?

276
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:00,801
I don't know--it's like he's
got an octopus on his head.

277
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:03,671
Once he grabs you,
you're done for.

278
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:06,206
Come on... this is our
chance to get away...

279
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,208
The less we see of
that guy, the better.

280
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,445
Hey, wait... but how are
we supposed to get the key?

281
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:12,579
Oh, this little thing?

282
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,352
Stealing the key
was the easy part,

283
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,254
I just couldn't deal
with that hair of his...!

284
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,056
Anyway, have you
seen the others?

285
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:22,990
Before I get to that,

286
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:24,658
could you tell me
what number your key is?

287
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,094
It has a number? Oh, it's three.

288
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:28,028
Wrong one.

289
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,330
You're gonna have
to explain this to me.

290
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,204
This place is falling apart!

291
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:40,441
Wait... what? Is that a doll?

292
00:20:40,474 --> 00:20:44,344
No... It's Sanji...!

293
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:47,147
What the heck happened to him?

294
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:50,050
Sanji! Can you hear me...?

295
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,353
What's going on?
Who did this to you?

296
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:54,621
Are you all right?
Say something!

297
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,260
Sanji!

298
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:11,038
I'm sorry... I lost...
I couldn't... get the key.

299
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:13,607
Hold on, okay...?
I'll see what I can do.

300
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:17,777
Sanji lost?
I can't believe it...

301
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:32,559
Hey, Sanji... You
really couldn't win...?

302
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:35,229
You really gave it your all?

303
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:38,365
You fought that blonde
woman, didn't you...?

304
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:42,036
I see... You must've
gone easy on her.

305
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:44,538
I'm sorry I couldn't
get the key.

306
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:45,472
Forget the key...!

307
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,675
This fight is a matter
of life and death!

308
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,711
You can't stick to your
stupid code of honor, okay?

309
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:53,347
Is chivalry really
worth dying for?

310
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,749
People are counting on you!

311
00:21:55,782 --> 00:22:00,054
I don't want this...
I don't want to die...

312
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:02,623
But I was raised to
never hit a lady...

313
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:06,126
no matter what...
So even at a time like this...

314
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:13,066
Even if it kills me...
I won't... kick... a woman...

315
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:20,574
I see... That's stupid!

316
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,077
He was coughing up blood,
Nami--don't hit him!

317
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,046
Is running away against
your code of honor, too...?

318
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,349
Because that's not worth
dying over either...!

319
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:32,252
Nobody wants to see you
throw your life away in vain.

320
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,588
Leave that woman to me...

321
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:35,789
You try to get better.

322
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,758
And by the way...

323
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:42,463
Even if it's dumb, I like
that chivalry of yours.

324
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:45,199
What...? Did...
she say she loved me?

325
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:47,500
Not even close!

326
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:55,542
For the record...
I won't play nice.

327
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:59,579
Neither will I...
We'll get along fine.

328
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,495
Hey! You wanna save Nico Robin?

329
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:15,696
Get me some cola!

330
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,264
I still haven't forgiven you!

331
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:18,799
I don't need
forgiveness, brother...

332
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,768
I need cola! Now hop to it!

333
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:23,103
What kind of idiot
uses cola to power up?!

334
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,607
The kind of idiot that kicks
a lot of ass, okay? Just watch!

335
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,678
On the next One Piece:
"Fukurou's Miscalculation!

336
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:32,780
My Cola is the Water of Life."

337
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:35,048
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
