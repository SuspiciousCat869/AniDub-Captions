attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:12,579
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,582
You can have it!

7
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:18,918
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

Now you just have to find it!

00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:26,126

Never in a million years

She wouldn't do that
to her friends!

[NAMI] What was that
about friends, Luffy?

Friends, huh?
Don't make me laugh.

You're just pathetic enough

[NOJIKO]
Now I see.

35
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,071
Yeah, that would hit her hard.

36
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,040
To think that someone
actually showed up for her.

Friends.

38
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:30,483
That word... means pain.

It breaks her heart.

40
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,489
So that's it. That's how
Nami pretended to kill me

41
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,658
and make sure I could
escape from Arlong Park.

42
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,994
Looks to me like she's got
some sort of hidden motive

for hangin' out with
a bunch of renegade fishmen.

Just trust me.
Don't get yourself involved

00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,012
[LUFFY]
For a walk.

Yeah, me neither.

It would seem we have
some unusual visitors.

"why are they here"?

Hey, you guys. Look!

59
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,612
He's not from this island.

[LUFFY]
Hm?

61
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,489
Oh, wow. They must be fishmen.

are you doing on this island?!

[LUFFY] Why?
What does it matter to you?

66
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,595
Well, it's just that we...
don't get many visitors.

Oh, well, my name's Luffy.
I'm just passing through.

[HATCHAN laughing]

73
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,314
He seems like he'd be
a fun guy to have around.

Yeah, sure,
but who the hell is he?

75
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,020
He walked right by us and
wasn't even intimidated.

76
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,188

So you're saying that
she raised both you and Nami?

80
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,199
That's right. She did.

81
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,169
I guess I should start...

82
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,038
...at the beginning.

83
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,047
I fell asleep.

Oh, no! Nojiko?

85
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,486
I wonder where she ran off to.

86
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,594
[NAMI]
Just a little more, Bellemere.

87
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,167
Just a little more and
everything will be ours again.

just get that book.

Hey, is that you, Nami?

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,787
Do you need any help there?

No, I'm just looking.

00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,892

Let me go!

that stealing is wrong?

How else am I going
to get what I need?

You're back.
That was a quick trip.

I got a ride.

Listen, you better
get control of her

00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,482
before she winds up
in a jail cell!

118
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,484
Thanks for the advice.

119
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,821
Haven't you ever seen somethin'
you've wanted and just taken it?

120
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,823
You're the reason
she acts this way!

[BELLEMERE]
Relax, I'm just kidding.

I hope you were
kind enough to pay for her.

Uh, Bellemere.

I don't have
the money right now.

I'll pay you somehow.

Does that sound good?

It's just, that I‐‐I really
need that book, Bellemere.

Then why didn't you ask me
if I would buy it for you.

141
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,271
[NAMI] Because I know
you can't afford it.

00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,572
Of course I can.

143
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,841
There's money left over
from the last harvest.

144

But I heard them in the village.

145
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,945
They said the
weather's been so good lately

146
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,014
that everyone's
tangerines will sell,

147
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,849
which means we can't
raise our price

148
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,851
or we may not be able
to sell at all!

149
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,020
[BELLEMERE] They don't know
what they're talking about.

Way to go, Nami.

151
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,958

no way I would have been caught.

I was just joking, that's all.

155
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,701
That really hurt.

[laughing]

157
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,374
I'm sorry.
But one thing's for sure,

158
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,711
the maps you draw
are so amazing, Nami.

159
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:10,316
I see you can draw land maps
now as well as sea charts.

160
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,886
[NOJIKO] That's a map
of our island, isn't it?

that such a little girl

drew this all by herself.

I wanted the book so I'd be able
to start studying navigation.

Navigation as well?

166
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,899
You're gonna be a navigator?

[NAMI] That's right,
I'm going to guide ships

around all the oceans
of the world.

344
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:12,184
That's true. Their family has
suffered so much over the years.

345
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:15,087
It's good to know that they've
managed to overcome it, right?

346

00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,601

‐‐[VILLAGERS screaming]
‐‐[VILLAGER O] Pirates!

[VILLAGER P] Quick,
the pirates are coming, hide!

352
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,453
‐‐The Arlong Pirates!
‐‐Arlong?!

‐‐That's impossible.
‐‐[VILLAGER T] Why would fishmen

354
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,591
from the Grand Line come here?

355

[VILLAGER U]
The rumor about the split

356
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,361
between the Fishmen Pirates
must be true.

Go hide in the woods.

Greetings and salutations,
you pathetic little humans.

From this moment on,

365
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,922
this entire island

are a part of my domain.

Yeah!

[ARLONG]
Listen closely.

369
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,597
From now, on the first day
of every month

370
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,299
you will buy your lives from me!

371
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,470
A hundred thousand
berries for adults,

372
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,572
fifty thousand for children.

373
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,308
Those who cannot pay...
will die!

00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,644
[ARLONG laughs intensely]

[NAMI]
What should we do, Nojiko?

376
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,282
We don't have that much money.

377
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,818
Maybe the fishmen won't
be able to find our house.

378
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,153
You can't see it from here.

379
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,161
Is that it? So what's the haul?

380
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:06,265
About 25 million, give or take.

381
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:11,169
You all shall live!
[laughing]

382
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,373
It looks like we each
have to pay 100,000 berries

383
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,376
to these fishmen
every month just to stay alive!

384
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,778
No, there's no way
we could survive.

385
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,180
We don't have a choice.
We should just be happy

386
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,517
that nobody in the village
has been killed yet.

387
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,286
[GENZO]
If all they want is money,

388
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,455
that's an easy price to pay.

389
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:34,226
I just hope they leave without
noticing Bellemere's house.

390
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,562
With two children
she'd need 200,000 berries.

391
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,299
There's no way
she has that much saved.

392
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,536
[ARLONG]
It's time to leave.

393
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,672
Come, brothers.

396

[FISHMAN J] Arlong!
There's smoke coming from

397
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,478
outside the village!

398

Delicious! There isn't
anything quite as tasty

402
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,725
as my special tangerine sauce.

403
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,361
Nami and Nojiko
are gonna love it.

404
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,831
It looks like chimney smoke
from somebody's house.

405
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:16,501
Oh? We almost missed that one.

to Bellemere's house.

Nojiko and Nami are gone!

What did you say?!

412
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,724
I think the duck
needs another ten mintues.

413
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,892
And the stew is almost ready.

414
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,928
This is definitely
gonna blow my budget,

415
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,764
but sometimes
you gotta live a little.
