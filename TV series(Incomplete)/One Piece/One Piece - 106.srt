from a lack of food and water
as a result of your actions.

175
00:08:59,105 --> 00:08:59,939
Why would you do such a thing?

176
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,874
[COBRA]
I am aware of that, of course.

177
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,610
And many oases have
dried up as well.

178
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:10,216
But sacrifices are essential if
we are to protect the country.

179
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,417
You're mad!

180
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,985
You knew how
desperate things were,

181
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,987
and yet, you only
helped yourself?

182
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,956
No decent ruler
would be so selfish

183
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,825
if he knew his own
people were in need!

184
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,894
How dare you, a common peasant,

185
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,498
speak disrespectfully
to your lord and master.

186
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,234
Even though I needn't
justify my actions to you,

187
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,571
I came to Nanohana to
apologize for what I've done.

188
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,606
What more do you want?

189
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,076
My brother died in
Yuba thanks to you.

190
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,947
[COBRA] I didn't come all
the way to this town

191
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,348
just to apologize.

192
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,283
There is another reason.

193
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,618
As you may know,

194
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:49,021
Dance Powder is outlawed
by the World Government.

195
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,357
If word got out that
it had been used here,

196
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,192
the Marines would
certainly take action

197
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,261
and destroy this country.

198
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,363
I cannot allow that.

199
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,199
You may also remember that
large amounts of Dance Powder

200
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:04,003
were found being smuggled out
of this town two years ago.

201
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:08,207
It is necessary to eliminate
all traces of that incident.

202
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,310
Do I make myself clear?

203
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,478
You mean‐‐?

204
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,713
[COBRA]
I do.

205
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,983
There is only one way to erase
this incident from our past.

206
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:20,286
We must obliterate Nanohana
and everyone in it!

207
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,656
[NANOHANA D] We have to
die because of your whim?

208
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,657
[NANOHANA E]
What are you saying?!

209
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,459
[NANOHANA F]
That's insane!

210
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,060
[KAPPA]
Hey, King!

211
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,861
[COBRA]
Hm?

212
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,397
So it was all your
fault after all!

213
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:35,635
You‐You stole the rain
and killed the towns!

214
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:39,305
I'll get even with you
for what you've done!

215
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,218
I'll make you pay
for this. I will.

216
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,686
Kappa, are you all right?

217
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,422
Please... no...

218
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,426
[COBRA]
Men!

219
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,496
Burn it to the ground
and leave no one alive!

220
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,434
[NANOHANA A]
Koza!

221
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,002
[NANOHANA B]
It's Koza!

222
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,543
[inaudible]

223
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,746
Koza, it's been awhile.

224
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,416
What are you doing?

225
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:27,186
What?

226
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,470
What are you doing?

227
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,538
What?

228
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,772
Cobra!

229
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:47,873
No!

230
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,810
I'm apologizing. I thought
I had made that clear.

231
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,478
Shut up! Just shut up!

232
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,946
Do you have any idea
what you're doing

233
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,715
to the people who
believed in you?

234
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:56,982
It is an insult!

235
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,486
Nevertheless, I am the one who
has been using Dance Powder to‐‐

236
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,722
I told you to shut up!

237
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,789
[COBRA]
Why are you so angry? Surely...

238
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,658
Koza.

239
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,459
Your Highness.

240
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,928
[KOZA]
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

241
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:09,895
What I'm trying to do‐‐

242
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,398
You cold, heartless bastard!

243
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,400
Don't‐Don't you understand?

244
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,936
Don't you know how these people
felt as they died of thirst?

245
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,905
They felt no hatred
or anger towards you!

246
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,841
"It isn't the king's fault
this is happening to us!

247
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,309
He's a great leader!"

248
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:24,944
Those were the words on
their lips as they died!

249
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,779
They never lost faith in you!

250
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,080
But now...

251
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,649
...you come here and apologize,
and what happens to their faith?

252
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,753
At least have the decency to
lie and say you're innocent.

253
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,865
[KOZA]
Co... bra.

254
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,101

257
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,344
Okay, kids! Let's go!

258
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,947
[KOZA] Didn't we fight
because the kingdom,

259
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:07,520
because everyone, wanted to
know if you were innocent?

260
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,854
[ALL yelp]

[NANOHANA CITIZENS screaming]

262
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,631
[KOZA]
At the very least...

263
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,502
[KOZA]
...that's why I fought.

264
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,977
[NANOHANA H]
I don't believe it!

265
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,558
Show time.

266
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,994
A giant ship's about to crash!

267
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,068

What kinda ship is that?

[NANOHANA CITIZENS screaming]

273
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:27,766
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER] For the big
finale, that was sure easy.

274
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,370
Have we ever done
anything that wasn't easy?

00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,974
[COBRA laughing]

276
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,609

We pulled it off!

277
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,778
Now let's light the fires
and get outta here!

278
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:40,746
Ooooo!

279
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,150
It feels so good to get
back into gear! Ha!

[REBEL E] Koza! Say
something, Koza! Come on!

00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,725
Look! The royal army

00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:53,659
[REBEL E]
What?

00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,628
[BON CLAY laughing]

285
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,997
Was I the kingly‐est king
you ever saw back there,

286
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,431
or was I not?

287
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,399
[FLUNKY A, FLUNKY B]
Yes!

288
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,635
You were the greatest,

[NANOHANA CITIZENS screaming]

290
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,838
[NANOHANA A]
Stop those fires!

291
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,507
[NANOHANA B] The royal army
started the fires then ran off!

00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,408
[NANOHANA C]
Hurry!

293
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,777
[NANOHANA D]
We've got to put them out!

294
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,579
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
Now all we have to do is meet up

295
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,948
with Mr. 2 outside town.

296
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,751
Alubarna's the grand climax.

Hm.

298
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,655

[BON CLAY laughing]

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,492
[BON CLAY] You know, my
favorite word is "vague"!

00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,760
I love that word!

302
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,963
The king's prospects of staying
king are exceedingly vague!

303
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,698
The operation is a success!

Where's Bunchi?

What the‐‐?

307
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,541
The king turned into some
kinda weird ballerina.

308
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,610
[NANOHANA C]
It's no use! We can't stop it!

Damn the king!

310
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,015
He wasn't the king!

00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,953
This is bad! Everyone's been
tricked! I have to tell them!

[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
What a naughty boy.

00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,526
How much do you think he knows?

314
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,064
[MR. 1] That imbecile. He had to
get careless and screw up.

315
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,131
Who are you?

316
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:10,736
I don't suppose you'd stay
quiet if we asked you.

317
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,204
[NANOHANA B]
Water! We need more water!

00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,840
[NANOHANA F] Wait! That's my
water! Can you pay for it?

319
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,476
[NANOHANA C] Not now, you idiot!
The town's on fire!

320
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,544
[NANOHANA D]
Put out the fire!

00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,845
[NANOHANA E]
Water!

322
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:23,048
Useless. It's just
burning too quickly.

323
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,917
We should escape
while we still can.

324
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,885
Don't give up yet, Koza!

325
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,854
You're not the type to just
give in and die like this,

00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,222
you gotta fight!

327
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,590
Huh?

00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,696
What? Here, take Koza!

Hey, kid! Say something!

Damn. Even children aren't safe.

Don't try and talk,
kid. I've gotcha!

It's not what you think!

00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,011
Everyone's been tricked!

This country... must die.

[KOZA]
Contact all of our units.

341
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:10,529
This will be our final battle.

[REBEL C]
Well, all right,

343
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,867
but we still don't have
enough weapons.

No. We have plenty now.

You know that ship that
just crashed into town?

As fate would have it,
it's an armory ship.

Wait. Are you sure?

Yeah, it's full of weapons.

Shut up.

Now all that remains is for
Mr. 4's team to do its thing.

Fatty and that old hag

know how to get things done!

357
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,802
Catching the king will
be a snap! You'll see!

Oh, joy! I can't wait!

Hear me, rebel army!

360
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,610
The Alabasta of old is dead now!

361
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,946
This will be our
ultimate battle!

362
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,682
We go now to capture
the capital!

363
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,417
Onward...

364
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,852
...to Alubarna!

The king must pay!

367

[REBEL B]
We'll build a new country!

368
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,596
[CHAKA]
That's absurd!

369
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,466
Lord Cobra would never do
anything as mad as that!

370
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,834
It must be a mistake!

371
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:22,801
It's true!

372
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:23,869
And what's more,

373
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,938
the timing between his
disappearance from the palace

374
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:29,675
and his appearance in
Nanohana fits perfectly!

375
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,610
Excuses are useless now!

376
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:34,680
News of the Nanohana incident
has spread throughout Alabasta

377
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,349
and rebel soldiers
everywhere are responding.

378
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,651
Even worse, citizens who
once had faith in the king

379
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,720
are now taking up
arms against him.

380

They're on their way here!

rising up in rebellion!

We have to act!

My lord, please command us.

Whatever you decide,
we will obey you.

How can this be?

386
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:06,845
Even the king's words from
yesterday seem blurred now.

What can I depend on?

388

Very well.

389
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,486
We have no choice but to
perform our sworn duty.

390
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,856
We are the Royal
Guards of Alabasta.

391
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,025
We cannot let the kingdom
crumble to the ground

I wager you can hear
the howls of the kingdom,

the same thing:

I've had to make so many moves
to be able to get to this point.

inflame the citizens.

Manipulating the royal army.
