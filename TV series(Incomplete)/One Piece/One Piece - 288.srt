1
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:37,057
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,394
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:44,231
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:49,202
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,405
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,506
You can have it!

7
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,743
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,345
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,582
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,818
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,221
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,162
I can see the Gates
of Justice from here,

13
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,431
but I don't know if
I can get there on a boat.

14
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,633
I don't have time
to stand here and think.

15
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,401
I gotta give it a shot at least!

16
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,370
Here goes nothing!

17
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,242
Whoa! Are you okay, Pirate Guy?

18
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,110
You're not looking so good!

19
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:40,287
Hey, Sanji.
You really couldn't win?

20
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,423
You really gave it your all?

21
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:45,826
You fought that blonde
woman, didn't you?

22
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,729
I see. You must've
gone easy on her.

23
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:52,399
I'm sorry
I couldn't get the key.

24
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,333
Forget the key!

25
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,336
This fight is a matter
of life and death!

26
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,439
You can't stick to your
stupid code of honor, okay?

27
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:01,141
Is chivalry really
worth dying for?

28
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,177
People are counting on you!

29
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,648
I don't want this.
I don't want to die.

30
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,517
But I was raised
to never hit a lady,

31
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,652
no matter what.

32
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,621
So even at a time like this,

33
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:20,393
even if it kills me,
I won't kick a woman.

34
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,067
I see. That's stupid!

35
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,470
He was coughing up blood, Nami!

36
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:30,471
Don't hit him!

37
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:33,274
Is running away against
your code of honor, too?

38
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,743
Because that's not
worth dying over either!

39
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:39,680
Nobody wants to see you
throw your life away in vain.

40
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,448
Leave that woman to me.

41
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,484
You try to get better.

42
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,620
And by the way,
even if it's dumb,

43
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,123
I like that chivalry of yours.

44
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:49,757
What?

45
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,558
Did she say she loved me?

46
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,526
Not even close!

47
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,503
For the record,
I won't play nice.

48
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,371
Neither will I.

49
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,273
We'll get along fine.

50
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,256
Yoyoi!

51
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,225
I have returned at last!

52
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,126
Not him again!

53
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,628
Stop right there!

54
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:33,166
I won't let you escape
from me, understand?

55
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,102
Go deal with that
woman up there, Nami!

56
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,337
Leave this guy to me!

57
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,306
Right! Got it!

58
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,376
Yoi! Yoi! Yoyoyoi!

59
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,245
Just try and stop me!

60
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:48,014
Cloven Cross!

61
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:09,470
How dare you!
She's getting away!

62
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,273
That's right.
Now, you'll be fighting me!

63
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,607
Bring it!

64
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,087
Push it out!

65
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,655
Meow, Meow!

66
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:28,756
Push it out!

67
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:29,690
Meow, Meow!

68
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,724
Push it out!

69
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,759
Meow, Meow!

70
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,059
Push it--

71
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,527
Geez!

72
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,663
There's no way that little boat

73
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,364
was gonna make it across there!

74
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,133
Are you stupid or something?

75
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,234
Meow! Meow!

76
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,168
You don't understand!

77
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,804
Robin's being taken
through those gates!

78
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:47,240
I have to hurry, or I won't
be able to bring her back!

79
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,813
It's pretty far,
but I should be able

80
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,448
to reach that building
right in front of 'em.

81
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,417
Wait! What do you
think you're doing?

82
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,452
Hold on,
Mister Pirate! Calm down!

83
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:59,152
Meow! Meow!

84
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,654
If I can't get there by boat,

85
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,156
I'm gonna have to jump!

86
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,791
We came to tell you that

87
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:07,627
we found a way to get over
to the Gates of Justice!

88
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,680
What is this place?

89
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,215
Some kind of basement?

90
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,750
It's an underground passage.

91
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,385
This takes you under the ocean

92
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,420
and over to the
Gates of Justice.

93
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,457
Oh, is that so? Right!

94
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,358
Hold on!

95
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:42,229
You don't even know
how to get there!

96
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,202
You're the awesomest for
showing me this tunnel!

97
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,637
How'd you know about it, anyway?

98
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,339
We caught Lucci
going down the stairs

99
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,108
with that noisy servant of his.

100
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,210
That guy was talking
and laughing so much

101
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,178
they didn't notice
that we were behind them!

102
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,583
There's no way those pirates

103
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:03,751
will figure out
where the entrance is!

104
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,519
They'll never find us!

105
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,720
Lucci and that
black-haired pirate lady

106
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,623
went through the
secret doorway, too.

107
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,505
So this is it, huh?

108
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,179
Man, this door is pretty thick!

109
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,414
Do you know how to open it?

110
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:35,416
Well, Lucci's servant
was messing around

111
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:37,217
with something over here.

112
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,254
I bet you unlock it
using this big keyhole!

113
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:43,490
But I don't see a key.

114
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,533
All right. Stand back.

115
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,701
Why? What're you gonna do?

116
00:08:57,437 --> 00:09:00,640
This is the way we need
to go to get there, right?

117
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,355
Third Gear!

118
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,629
It's open.

119
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,140
All right! Time to head out!

120
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:10,277
No way! How'd you
make yourself all tiny?

121
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:26,760
You sure are funny,
Mister Pirate Guy!

122
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,495
Meow! Meow!

123
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:31,198
Come on! We've still
got a lot of work to do!

124
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,265
Meow!

125
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,269
Wait.

126
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,605
Did you just hear a loud
noise, or did I imagine it?

127
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,406
No. It couldn't be.
It was nothing.

128
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,808
Maybe it was the sound

129
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,310
of one of the pirates
breaking down the door.

130
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,246
What? Impossible!
Don't be absurd!

131
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,282
First off, those are thick
iron doors we're talking about!

132
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,050
And secondly, there's
no way they could have

133
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,452
even found them
in the first place!

134
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,453
It was nothing!

135
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,054
Actually, there is a way.

136
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,423
A child and her
pet were following us.

137
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,490
They could have told them.

138
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:01,628
But, if you saw them,
why didn't you stop them?

139
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:09,436
Because I wasn't
ordered to do so.

140
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:13,140
What? You gotta be kidding me!

141
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,042
You should be able to make
the call about something

142
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,444
so obviously wrong
on your own, you idiot!

143
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,746
Don't you realize
what could happen?

144
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,048
So you're telling me
that those damn pirates

145
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,384
are most likely on their
way down here right now?

146
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,119
That's a fair assessment.

147
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:28,222
No! Hey! Keep it down!

148
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,757
Oh wait, that was me.

149
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,392
Now, listen up, Lucci!

150
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,394
Your top priority,
above any other order given,

151
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,730
is the protection of
my life. You understand?

152
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,432
Eliminate every single person

153
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:41,035
that would do me
harm or get in my way!

154
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,269
Anyone that defies
me is committing an act

155
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,538
of treason against
the World Government!

156
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,307
They deserve nothing less
than a death sentence!

157
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,181
Huh? Hey! What's that look for?

158
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:03,490
You've got no time to worry
about others, Nico Robin.

159
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,560
Hell is waiting
for you just up ahead.

160
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:09,229
Lucci! Pick her up
and bring her along.

161
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,651
All right! Back to normal!

162
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,256
Hang on, Robin!

163
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:43,530
Stupid pigeon guy!
I can't wait to kick your ass!

164
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:53,373
In the end, the reason
Sanji lost was his own fault.

165
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:58,578
But what in the world
did she do to him?

166
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:28,074
What the hell?
At a time like this?

167
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,747
She's got guts,
I'll give her that.

168
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,406
Damn! I'm slowin' down.

169
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,409
Gotta refill my cola
as soon as possible.

170
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,212
He moves around
pretty fast for a big guy.

171
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,680
Jumps high, too.

172
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:13,787
Chapapa. Looking for me?

173
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,290
Damn straight!

174
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,292
But you keep running away.

175
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,660
Chapapa.

176
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,395
Well, if you
were a little faster,

177
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,130
maybe I'd actually feel one of

178
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,132
those punches
you're so proud of.

179
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:28,034
Franky Triangle Jacker!

180
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:35,142
Chapapa. Think your
sideburns can hurt me?

181
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,576
Not a chance!

182
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:39,079
Gotcha!

183
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,016
Weapons Left!

184
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:49,089
Damn!

185
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:51,191
That was just about
the last of the cola.

186
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,294
Gotta get to that kitchen quick!

187
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:54,495
Ha! Not so fast!

188
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,730
Bastard! You dodged my attack!

189
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,366
What? Afraid it might
actually hurt you?

190
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,536
Chapa. What's that?

191
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:06,273
What's wrong, coward?

192
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,609
Shouldn't you have
run off by now?

193
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:11,478
Coward? No one calls me that!

194
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,148
You just pissed
off the wrong guy!

195
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:17,585
How'd you like a
taste of my killer fists?

196
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:19,486
Here's my own
special punch combined

197
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,622
with the Finger Pistol!
Solid Beast!

198
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,731
Chapapa.

199
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,037
Pathetic.
That's got nothing on--

200
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,240
My Strong...

201
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,241
Iron Body!

202
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,443
...Hammer!

203
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:48,682
Is that all you got?

204
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,684
That was the weakest punch ever.

205
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,570
All your punches
are lazy and flabby.

206
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,573
No way.

207
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:16,510
Your punches are the
lazy and flabby ones!

208
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:19,513
They're like flimsy,
under-powered, paper punches.

209
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:23,016
Yours are flimsy
underpants punches!

210
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:30,391
Underpants?

211
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,459
Under-powered, not under-pants!

212
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,194
You're under-powered-pants!

213
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,629
Oh, yeah? You're a stupid bra!

214
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,598
Shut up, pair of socks!

215
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,632
Long johns!

216
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,500
Boxer-briefs!

217
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:40,434
Loin cloth!

218
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,402
Chapapapapapa!

219
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:52,680
Get off me!

220
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:54,515
Shut your change-purse hole!

221
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:58,385
All right! Finally
made it into the kitchen.

222
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:03,189
Whoa! Jackpot! Look at
the size of that 'fridge!

223
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:09,630
Hey, he changed!

224
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:11,665
Gorilla Devil
Fruit powers maybe?

225
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,100
Dammit!

226
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,169
My three minutes are already up!

227
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:18,305
I used the Rumble Ball
too early in the fight.

228
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,107
What now?

229
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,744
Yoyoi!

230
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:29,450
You will now
disappear from this world!

231
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:35,823
Fi-ni-shing-blow! Yoyoi!

232
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:36,557
Bastard!

233
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,158
Yoyoi!

234
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,492
Yes! It has a lock!

235
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:42,196
Chapa? Kumadori!

236
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:46,133
All right! I locked him up!

237
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:46,767
Why you!

238
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,935
Hey, hold on a second!

239
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:51,205
I've got some business with
that 'fridge, gorilla-man!

240
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,474
CP9 and that jerk!

241
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,609
It's Franky!
I'm on your side, remember?

242
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,111
Who're you calling gorilla-man?

243
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,145
Damn, you're slow!

244
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,112
Listen up!

245
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:01,515
I'm just like Luffy--I
haven't forgiven you

246
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,050
for what you did to us!

247
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,418
We lost a member of our crew!

248
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,489
And it's all your
fault, you bastard!

249
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:11,225
Give us our Usopp back!

250
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,393
What are you talking about?

251
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,094
You were just with him!

252
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,563
Look, forget about
all that for now!

253
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,365
Do you wanna get
Nico Robin back or not?

254
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:21,635
I do! Robin!

255
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,571
Then turn around,
get three bottles of cola

256
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,439
outta that fridge,
and give 'em to me!

257
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,474
That'll bring me
back up to full power!

258
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,410
After that, I'll be
able to pound these jerks

259
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,078
into the ground
and take their keys!

260
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,346
No problem!

261
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,648
What kind of an idiot
gets stronger from cola?

262
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,517
I do! Don't judge me!

263
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,454
How long do you two plan

264
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:43,357
on keeping up this comedy act?

265
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,225
You wanna stop for
a little tea party

266
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,660
in the middle of a fight?

267
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:49,129
That's not only
stupid, it's rude!

268
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,364
Secret Technique.

269
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:55,769
Owl Thrashing!

270
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,441
Chapapapapapapa!

271
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:03,743
Beans Left!

272
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:14,087
You call that an attack?

273
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,125
This is terrible!

274
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,494
He's right--He's
fighting on our side now.

275
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,196
I better help him.

276
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:24,131
Chapapapapa!

277
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,467
If I open and close
the door really fast,

278
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,535
then he can't escape.

279
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:29,903
Now!

280
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:35,709
Yoyoi! The door has
suddenly open--

281
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,579
Yes! Franky! Catch!

282
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,015
You're a life saver!

283
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,726
Feeling Fresh!

284
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:58,232
What the--?

285
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:02,202
Fresh is the best!
Vegetable Punch! Go!

286
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,737
Solid Beast.

287
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,741
That was vegetable juice, jerk!

288
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:11,512
How am I supposed to
power up on that crap!

289
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,647
Cola, dammit! Cola!

290
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,649
I just thought he
was really thirsty.

291
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:19,619
Yoyoi! The door--

292
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,188
Comin' atcha!

293
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,656
Thanks, man!

294
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,696
My heart is feelin' gooooood!

295
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:33,734
And now. I'll sit a spell.

296
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:36,804
I've tended to the fields
enough for one day, neighbor.

297
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,405
Let's stop all this fightin'.

298
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:42,309
Kick our feet up and have
ourselves a nice cup of tea.

299
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,078
Tea does a body good!

300
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:46,780
That's not cola,
either! Dumbass!

301
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:50,651
He is the funniest thing ever.

302
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,419
Hey! Stop looking
at me with that

303
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,620
"I wonder what else might happen

304
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:56,090
when I give him other drinks"
face, you little bastard!

305
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:58,592
Get it right, antler head!

306
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,395
So, the change doesn't
depend on what mood you're in?

307
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,430
Cola only! Now!

308
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,100
There it is! The real stuff!

309
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:09,603
That's cola, for sure!
Come to papa!

310
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,340
I don't know what's going on

311
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,609
but there's no way I'm
letting you get what you want!

312
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,611
Tempest Kick!

313
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:20,647
No! Franky!

314
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:35,528
Super--!

315
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:01,088
Chapapapa. Oh, come on!

316
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:02,556
It's not like
anything's gonna change

317
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:04,391
'cause you drank some cola.

318
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,128
Get ready.

319
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,397
Chapa? For what?

320
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,600
Another round of
your flimsy punches?

321
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:13,601
Gimme a break.

322
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:20,207
Strong Hammer!

323
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:23,610
Dobeba!

324
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:39,259
Amazing!

325
00:22:58,145 --> 00:22:59,113
Oh, you were right.

326
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:01,649
My punches were pretty flimsy.

327
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:05,719
But don't worry--that's
all gonna change.

328
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,063
So Zoro, how are we gonna
get these handcuffs off?

329
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:16,930
Easy.

330
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:17,898
We'll do
rock-paper-scissors to decide

331
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:18,899
whose hand gets cut off
at the wrist, then--

332
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:22,703
What the hell kind of
a crappy idea is that?

333
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:23,737
No way!

334
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,773
No? Well, I do
have another idea.

335
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:28,208
La-la-la! I'm not listening!

336
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,710
On the next One Piece:

337
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,745
"Zoro Busts Out a New Technique!

338
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:34,114
The Sword's Name
is Sniper King?"

339
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,316
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
