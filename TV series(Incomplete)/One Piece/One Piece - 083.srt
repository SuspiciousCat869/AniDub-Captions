175
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,725
[KUREHA]
Figured you'd ask about him.

176
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,460
[LUFFY]
Don't run away, meat!

177
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,062
[SANJI]
Don't eat it yet!

178
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:28,334
[CHOPPER yells]

179
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,468
[CHOPPER]
Leave me alone, humans!

180
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,836
[KUREHA]
His name is Chopper.

181
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:34,507
He's just a reindeer with
a blue nose, that's all.

182
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,778
[NAMI]
But normal reindeers don't talk.

183
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,846
[KUREHA] If he's different
from ordinary reindeers

184
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,582
in some way...

185
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,617
If he's different?

186
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:52,291
I am not food for you, okay?!

187
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,492
[KUREHA]
If he's different,

188
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,795
it's just because he ate a
Human Human Fruit, that's all.

189
00:09:55,828 --> 00:10:00,700
A Human Human Fruit?
A Devil Fruit... right?

190
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,801
[KUREHA]
That's right.

191
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,836
He's still a reindeer,
but now he has the abilities

192
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,440
of a human, like talking
and walking upright.

193
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,775
[CHOPPER]
No! This way!

194
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,678
And also, he's a doctor.
I taught Chopper everything

195
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,314
that I know about the
field of medicine.

196
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,392
[ROBSON]
Hm?

197
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,328
[CHESS] Wapol, sir, that Straw
Hat is up there somewhere.

198
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,397
[WAPOL] Good. I'm beginning
to get a little hungry.

199
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,400
I'll eat the rubber
man for a snack.

200
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,370
Heh! Now, let's go!

201
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:58,758
[VILLAGERS chattering]

202
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,360
Dalton, please don't
die on us here!

203
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,596
We'll find him in time,
I'm sure of it! We have to!

204
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,698
Dalton, please hang
in there, okay?

205
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,400
So who's Dalton?

206
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,535
Don't just stand there!
Do something, Zoro!

207
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,404
Gotta bow...

208
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,374
Like I was saying,
don't stand there. Get a shovel!

209
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,243
Help us find Dalton!

210
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,546
[ZORO]
What was that thing?

211
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:25,785
Everyone! We found
Dalton over here!

212
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,585
What?!

213
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,720
Yea!

214
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,854
Fantastic!

215
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:29,789
[USOPP]
We're coming!

216
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,391
[VIVI]
Oh, Dalton!

217
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,293
Who's Dalton?

218
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,534
This is horrible.

219
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,803
I can't feel a heartbeat!

220
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,711
You should be one of my crew.

221
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:55,748
Please, old lady. We really
need to have a doctor on board.

222
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,917
[KUREHA] Luffy, you did
tell me that's your name,

223
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,818
isn't that right?

224
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,785
Yeah.

225
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,754
[KUREHA] And did you
just call me "old lady"?

226
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,956
Yeah, right. That's what
I said, old lady.

227
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,426
If I were you, I'd be a little
more careful of what I say!

228
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,462
[LUFFY yelps]

229
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,599
I'm still well within my
youthful 130s, thank you.

230
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,736
Jeez... You're a tough old hag.

231
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:17,770
[SANJI grunts]

232
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:21,273
Are you boys really asking
me to become a pirate?

233
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,441
Don't be ridiculous!

234
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,977
That would be an incredible
waste of my precious time.

235
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,413
Besides, I have no interest
in life on the sea.

236
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,949
[LUFFY grunts]
Those are all lame excuses.

237
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,817
It's about adventure, old woman!

238
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,519
[KUREHA]
Well, this one's a slow learner.

239
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,622
Didn't I just tell you to
watch what you say?

240
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,958
[CHOPPER]
So these guys are pirates?

241
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,959
[SANJI groans]

242
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,361
[LUFFY]
Hm?

243
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,797
[ALL gasp]

244
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,831
[yells]

245
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:49,435
[LUFFY] Wait, food!
Come back here! Slow down!

246
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:51,871
[SANJI]
Get back here!

247
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,306
[KUREHA] That's enough
of that, idiots!

248
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,644
[CHOPPER yells]

249
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,514
[yelling continues]

250
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,648
[LUFFY]
One bite!

251
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,682
[SANJI] In just a few minutes,
I'm going to cook you

252
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,685
a delicious reindeer
dish you'll never forget!

253
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,488
[KUREHA]
I don't think so!

254
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,491
I'll eat you guys first
before I let that happen.

255
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,693
[LUFFY, SANJI]
Scary hag!

256
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,496
[SANJI, LUFFY yells]

257
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:21,500
[LUFFY] She's coming!
She's coming! She's coming...!

258
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,636
[NAMI]
I don't care about food.

259
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,005
I just want some
peace and quiet.

260
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,850
[NAMI] Snow? But that shouldn't
be inside the castle...

261
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,585
It's freezing.

262
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:42,688
[NAMI]
I'll close the door.

263
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,925
[CHOPPER]
No, you need to stay in bed!

264
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,028
After all, you still
have a fever.

265
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:49,929
[NAMI]
I don't think so.

266
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,364
It seems like it's
pretty much gone now.

267
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,867
I lost 'em... at least, for now.

268
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,037
Doctorine's medicine works
quickly to reduce the fever,

269
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,372
but the bacteria from the
Kestia will still remain

270
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,708
inside your body for a
little while longer.

271
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:05,911
So just take your antibiotic
shot and stay in bed.

272
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,848
[NAMI]
Thank you.

273
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,082
[CHOPPER]
Hm?

274
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:15,387
[NAMI] You're the one who's been
taking care of me, aren't you?

275
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,422
[NAMI chuckles]

276
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,023
[CHOPPER]
You just shut up!

277
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,793
I don't need thanks from you
or any other low‐life human!

278
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,895
[CHOPPER laughs]

279
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,130
Don't mock me!
Oh, never mind that!

280
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,866
I'm just being silly. Ha!

281
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,568
No, seriously,
I'm being such a fool.

282
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,536
[CHOPPER laughs]

283
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,606
He's not so good at
hiding his emotions.

284
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,644
[SANJI panting]

285
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,915
This castle's really strange.

286
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,750
It's freezing,
and filled with snow.

287
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,452
[LUFFY]
Huh?

288
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,122
It's cold in here!

289
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:53,392
[SANJI] Not the sharpest knife
in the drawer, are you Luffy?

290
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,932
Look at this.

291
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,474
[SANJI]
There's snow everywhere.

292
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:11,944
[SANJI]
And look,

293
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,014
all the doors to the unused
rooms are frozen shut, too.

294
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,595
[LUFFY, SANJI yell]

295
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,831
[KUREHA] Come back
here just a moment, boys!

296
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,803
[KUREHA]
I said come back here!

297
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,205
[SANJI] You should rethink this
idea about asking the old hag

298
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,142
to join our crew. A real doctor
doesn't chase her patients

299
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,045
around a freaky snow‐filled
castle trying to kill them!

300
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,116
Is it true that you
guys are pirates?

301
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,818
Yes.

302
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,653
Really real pirates.

303
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,554
Real pirates.

304
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,523
So, you have a flag
with a skull on it?

305
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,858
We do. It's on our ship.

306
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,827
So you're really interested
in pirates, huh?

307
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,665
No, I'm not at all!
You idiot! Shut up!

308
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:12,071
All right, all right.
I get it. Now calm down.

309
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,707
But... one more thing.

310
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,175
Do you wanna come with us?

311
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,343
[yelps]

312
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,512
[NAMI] You could come sail
with us... out on the ocean.

313
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,515
Hm? If you did, that would
really help me out a lot.

314
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,718
If we had a doctor on the ship,
then I wouldn't have to stay

315
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,519
in this place three
more days, right?

316
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,154
I think you'd have a really
good time if you came.

317
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,691
[CHOPPER] No! That's crazy!
You realize I'm a reindeer!

318
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,060
I don't belong on a ship
with a bunch of humans!

319
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,232
[CHOPPER] I mean, just look
at me. I'm a reindeer,

320
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,035
but I walk on two legs and
I talk and everything.

321
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,672
Animals aren't supposed
to be able to do that stuff.

322
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:50,576
I know, but if you're trying to
scare me off, it isn't working.

323
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,179
[CHOPPER]
But I have a blue nose.

324
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,224
[LUFFY]
There you are, meat!

325
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,892
[LUFFY, SANJI]
Come here, deer!

326
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,060
[CHOPPER screams]

327
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:11,063
[SANJI, LUFFY]
Come back!

328
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,798
[NAMI]
Uh...

329
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,966
[clattering]

330
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,937
[KUREHA sighing] Those brats
sure can run, can't they?

331
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,774
I don't much like what you
were doing there, girl.

332
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:22,775
[NAMI]
Hm?

333
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,643
[KUREHA] Trying to tempt
my reindeer away from me

334
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,145
without my permission.

335
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,280
What, I need your
permission to make a move

336
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,615
on a man all of a sudden?

337
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,651
[KUREHA cackles]
No, I suppose you don't.

338
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,054
If you wanna take him away
from here, go ahead.

339
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,057
But I must warn you, it won't
be as easy as you think.

340
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,092
Chopper has a
scar on his heart.

341
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,628
A deep one my
medicine can't cure.

342
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,798
From the moment he was born,
everyone including his parents

343
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,266
turned their backs on him.

344
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,168
[NAMI gasps]

345
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,904
[KUREHA] All because he
was born with a blue nose.

346
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,939
He was forced to walk at
the back of the group,

347
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,974
separated from the
rest of the reindeer.

348
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,311
Even though he was just
a helpless, new‐born.

349
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,647
Then one day...
he ate a Devil Fruit

350
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,250
and he became even more of an
outcast than he had been before.

351
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,099
[KUREHA] The other reindeer
pressured him to leave the herd.

352
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,201
His blue nose already
made him different,

353
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,038
but now he wasn't like the
ordinary reindeer at all.

354
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,340
Still, he was lonely
and wanted friends,

355
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,842
so he went down to a village,

356
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,045
walking on two legs
as humans do.

357
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,714
[VILLAGER C] Hey. What is
that creature over there?

358
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,316
[KUREHA] But even
walking on two legs,

359
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,785
he didn't look anything
like the humans.

360
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,955
And for some reason, his nose
was still blue, as well.

361
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,156
[VILLAGER D]
It looks like a yeti!

362
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,824
[VILLAGER E]
It's dangerous, I'm sure.

363
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,294
Get the children inside quickly!

364
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,996
[VILLAGER C]
A gun! Bring me a gun!

365
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,197
[VILLAGER D]
Yeah, shoot him!

366
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,999
[VILLAGER F]
Quick, before he runs away!

367
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,335
[VILLAGER E]
Get 'em!

368
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,036
[VILLAGER F]
Yeah, got em!

369
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,213
[VILLAGER F]
Stay away from us, freak!

370
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:13,252
[VILLAGERS yelling]

371
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,021
[KUREHA] He didn't
know what was wrong.

372
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,757
He couldn't understand why
they reacted to his appearance

373
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,359
with so much fear and anger.

374
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,061
[VILLAGER C]
Stay away, monster!

375
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,732
[KUREHA] He had gone to
the village seeking friends,

376
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,368
but they called him a monster
and drove him away.

377
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,771
He was no longer a reindeer,
but he wasn't a human, either.

378
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,073
He was something in between.

379
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,042
And so he lived
alone after that.

380
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,779
Caught between two worlds
that wouldn't accept him.

381
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,047
Now that you've heard his story,

382
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,050
do you think you can heal
the scar on his heart?

383
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,390
[SANJI] Luffy! Check out the
door at the front entrance.

384
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,624
It's wide open!

385
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,126
[LUFFY]
Huh?

386
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,698
[LUFFY grunts]
No wonder it's so cold in here.

387
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,300
[SANJI]
Anyway, let's close it.

388
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,402
With it open like that,
there's not much difference

389
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,536
between inside and
outside the castle.

390
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,440
[CHOPPER] Hey! Stop it!
Don't touch that door! Get away!

391
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,309
[SANJI, LUFFY]
Huh?

392
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,144
[SANJI] Never mind him.
Let's close it.

393
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,412
Or we're gonna freeze to death.

394
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,313
[LUFFY]
That's a good point.

395
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,583
Stop! Didn't you guys
hear what I said?

396
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,252
[CHOPPER]
Get back!

397
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,621
[gasps]

398
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,289
[CHOPPER growls]

399
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:28,327
What is with this guy? What the
hell is he so angry about?

400
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,297
[SANJI]
Hey! Come over here a second.

401
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,433
[LUFFY]
Huh?

402
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,672
[SANJI]
Look up there.

403
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,508
[LUFFY gasps]
Uh...

404
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,014
[birds chirping]

405
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,782
[SANJI] It's a bunch
of baby snow birds.

406
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,352
See? If we closed
the door, they'd fall.

407
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,188
[LUFFY] So that's the reason
they're leaving it open.

408
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,431
[birds chirping]

409
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,434
[SANJI, LUFFY gasp]
It's freezing!

410
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,537
Hold up a sec.

411
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,205
[SANJI]
Yeah?

412
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,373
[LUFFY yells]

413
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,142
That weird reindeer guy.
Wasn't he speaking earlier?

414
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,043
Now that you mention it,

415
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,047
I remember him walking
on two legs, too.

416
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,716
[BOTH]
He's a monster!

417
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,353
[LUFFY]
Okay, let's get this straight.

418
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,289
He walks upright and talks.

419
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,556
[SANJI]
But not human.

420
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,190
[LUFFY]
Has fur...

421
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:32,891
[SANJI]
He's little...

422
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,227
[LUFFY]
...and becomes big.

423
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,396
[SANJI, LUFFY]
Clearly a monster!

424
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,579
[LUFFY] What a cool guy!
I bet he's really interesting!

425
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:58,684
Hey wait. I know!
He should join us!

Did you see the reindeer?

[NAMI]
Come on, guys.

445
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,666
Can't you just leave
him alone already?

446
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,902
[SANJI] What, just because
we were trying to eat him?

447
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:24,770
[NAMI]
You don't understand.

448
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,671
Chopper's had a really
difficult life.

449
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,806
[LUFFY]
Oh, yeah?

450
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,775
[NAMI] But apparently, he did
eventually find someone

451
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,510
who would accept
him for who he was.
