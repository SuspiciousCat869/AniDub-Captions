WEBVTT

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.330
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:42.905
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.922
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:46.232
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.704
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:52.011
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:53.881
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.253
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:59.024
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:03.266
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.936
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.744
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:13.019
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:16.794
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.827 --> 00:03:18.764
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:20.935
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:23.440
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:26.045
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.483
Upon arrival, Luffy entered
a fighting tournament

00:03:28.517 --> 00:03:31.356
that promises the Flame Flame
Fruit to the champion.

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.495
Meanwhile, a toy soldier
hoping to take down Doflamingo

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.499
tells Usopp, Robin,
and Franky about

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:39.939
a tragedy that occurred in
Dressrosa ten years ago.

00:03:39.973 --> 00:03:44.248
[DOLDO]
Stop!

00:03:44.983 --> 00:03:46.653
[DOLDO]
If there's no way to prevent me

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:48.924
from hurting my own people...

00:03:50.995 --> 00:03:56.574
[DOLDO] Someone! Anyone!
Please! Kill me!

00:03:56.607 --> 00:04:03.186
[DOFLAMINGO cackling]

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:05.925
We have come to rescue
this broken kingdom.

00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:10.668
So say hello to your new ruler,
Don Quixote Doflamingo!

00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:13.574
In just a single night,
the kingdom fell

00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:16.045
into the vile hands
of Doflamingo.

00:04:16.078 --> 00:04:18.450
Regrettably we fell for it, too.

00:04:18.483 --> 00:04:21.389
Thinking that King Riku
had lost his mind,

00:04:21.422 --> 00:04:23.026
we reached out to the new king

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:26.165
and were duped into
our current circumstances.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.773
I'm so ashamed of myself
for ever trusting him.

00:04:29.806 --> 00:04:32.812
So sad! That's a real shame.

00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:34.115
It must be so frustrating

00:04:34.148 --> 00:04:36.052
to know the once beloved
king of this country

00:04:36.086 --> 00:04:38.524
was set up and tragically
died a hated man.

00:04:38.557 --> 00:04:41.429
Not quite. For King Riku
is still alive.

00:04:41.462 --> 00:04:43.033
While a good number surrendered,

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:45.270
many men lost
their lives that day.

00:04:45.303 --> 00:04:47.474
But even when you
add up those numbers,

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.846
it doesn't account for
a kingdom's full army.

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.384
But I do believe, even with
their muddled minds,

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.787
that everyone turned into a toy

00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:56.159
must feel vengeful
towards Doflamingo.

00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:58.931
The key to our victory
lies with them.

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:00.100
That unknown quantity of

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.839
downtrodden and
silenced individuals.

00:05:05.377 --> 00:05:07.582
[LUFFY]
"A Showdown Between Warlords!

00:05:07.616 --> 00:05:10.086
Law vs. Doflamingo!"

00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:13.928
Hey! You needed to talk to me?

00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:15.097
I'm up here, you guys!

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.898
Luffy!

00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:17.869
[KIN'EMON gasping]
Shh, shh!

00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:19.973
Stop yelling so loud, would ya?

00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:21.577
Somebody's gonna find us out!

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.679
[KIN'EMON]
Shh, shh! You, too!

00:05:22.712 --> 00:05:25.718
[LUFFY] Oh, sorry!
I was just happy to see you!

00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:28.055
Ah, so you met with
that green-haired man?

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:30.694
I was somewhat reticent
about trusting him at first,

00:05:30.728 --> 00:05:33.466
but he seemed quite eager to
offer his assistance to us.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:34.736
[ZORO]
Where is he now?

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.408
[LUFFY] I dunno, he just like
passed out, or something.

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:40.013
[ZORO] Passed out?
What is wrong with that guy?

00:05:40.047 --> 00:05:41.282
[LUFFY]
Beats me.

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.628
There you are,
Straw Hat. Finally.

00:05:47.662 --> 00:05:50.868
So Joker is ordering me
to murder Straw Hat now?

00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:54.007
Make sure it's done
before the competition ends.

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:56.078
You do want to
become an executive

00:05:56.112 --> 00:05:58.316
of the Family, don't you?

00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:08.704
[BELLAMY] Nothing personal,
this is just the way it is.

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:13.848
[BELLAMY] I'm getting on
Doflamingo's ship,

00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:15.618
no matter what it takes!

00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:19.324
You can do it!
Keep hangin' in there!

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:24.636
[BELLAMY] I'm not gonna hold
a grudge against you anymore.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.476
Either way,
I'm done laughing at you.

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:41.636
[LUFFY] I dunno, maybe
he's sick or something,

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.243
he was acting real weird.
But whatever. Hm?

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.719
[ZORO]
Did something happen? Hey!

00:06:49.752 --> 00:06:51.288
[LUFFY]
Nah, nothing.

00:06:51.322 --> 00:06:54.061
Anyway, it's like
a maze in here, you guys.

00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:56.098
I keep getting lost.

00:07:00.842 --> 00:07:02.912
[DELLINGER]
Ee! There you are, Bellamy!

00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:03.915
[BELLAMY gasps]

00:07:03.948 --> 00:07:06.553
[DELLINGER] So, have you
murdered him yet?

00:07:06.586 --> 00:07:09.726
[laughs] I bet you haven't,
you big dummy!

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:13.166
[grunts] Dellinger. I'm busy!

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.705
[DELLINGER laughs]
Well, if you're standing there

00:07:15.738 --> 00:07:17.040
and not murdering Straw Hat,

00:07:17.073 --> 00:07:18.978
then I say you're
not busy enough!

00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:22.217
You need me to give
you a hand? [laughs]

00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:23.621
Buzz off!

00:07:23.654 --> 00:07:25.423
He's a lot stronger than you!

00:07:25.456 --> 00:07:27.562
We expected you'd screw it up!

00:07:27.595 --> 00:07:30.300
But y'know, it doesn't
matter if you fail!

00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:33.139
In fact, the whole thing never
mattered in the first place!

00:07:33.172 --> 00:07:34.242
What d'you mean?

00:07:34.275 --> 00:07:36.312
The assassination
order was mostly just

00:07:36.345 --> 00:07:38.249
an attempt to get you
out of the way.

00:07:38.282 --> 00:07:39.819
It's annoying how
you keep trying to

00:07:39.853 --> 00:07:41.355
win our approval, y'know!

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:45.030
That's why I'm gonna finish
you off, right here and now.

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:47.501
On the young master's order.

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:49.506
[BELLAMY]
No, that can't be.

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:51.176
[DELLINGER]
Oops! I shouldn't have said

00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:53.279
that part out loud, huh?

00:07:53.313 --> 00:07:56.185
Ee! Sorry! [laughs]

00:07:56.218 --> 00:07:57.955
He wants me dead?

00:07:57.989 --> 00:08:02.230
That's enough chit-chat.
Time to die.

00:08:02.263 --> 00:08:03.499
[BELLAMY groans]

00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:11.482
[DELLINGER laughs] Didn't think
I was kidding, did you?

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:21.468
[LAW]
Room!

00:08:28.784 --> 00:08:32.925
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
Why are you running away?

00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.163
I thought you
wanted to kill me!

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.668
[LAW]
Room!

00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:40.339
[LAW]
Takt!

00:08:50.561 --> 00:08:53.299
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:54.770
[LAW grunts]

00:08:54.803 --> 00:08:55.904
Scalpel!

00:09:07.227 --> 00:09:09.900
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
He talks big.

00:09:09.933 --> 00:09:12.404
But look at that--
Worn out already!

00:09:12.437 --> 00:09:15.911
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
You can't escape me, brat!

00:09:18.551 --> 00:09:19.752
Now, Room!

00:09:23.794 --> 00:09:24.629
[LAW]
And Shambles!

00:09:24.662 --> 00:09:26.098
What the hell?

00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:35.049
That Op Op Fruit
of yours is handy.

00:09:35.083 --> 00:09:36.620
For the moment, at least.

00:09:36.654 --> 00:09:38.691
Though I did notice,
there seems to be

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:42.130
a limit to how much
you can use its power.

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:44.602
You've already dealt with
Fujitora's meteor,

00:09:44.635 --> 00:09:47.307
had a scuffle with me,
and bailed out Black Leg.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.581
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
How much more've you got, huh?

00:09:54.355 --> 00:09:56.292
[panting]

00:09:56.325 --> 00:09:57.895
Bullet String!

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.719
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:10:09.753 --> 00:10:11.288
Now, Room!

00:10:14.328 --> 00:10:15.597
Hurry up!

00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:19.171
[LAW groans]

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:24.715
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
So? Now what, Law?

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.696
[DOFLAMINGO] So close!
Dressrosa's right there!

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.135
[panting]

00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:35.871
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:10:35.904 --> 00:10:39.177
[LAW panting]

00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:48.597
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A ringing]

00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:10.073
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Cu-lick.

00:11:10.107 --> 00:11:11.643
[DIAMANTE]
Hey. Doffy.

00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:12.912
Is that Diamante?

00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:14.615
[LAW yells]

00:11:16.886 --> 00:11:17.989
[DIAMANTE]
Oh, sorry.

00:11:18.022 --> 00:11:20.060
You in the middle of
some business right now?

00:11:20.093 --> 00:11:22.798
[DOFLAMINGO]
No, it's nothing. Go ahead.

00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:25.804
Violet betrayed us and
she's making a run for it.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.814
Huh. Seeing as
Black Leg is still alive,

00:11:30.848 --> 00:11:33.119
I s'pose I should've
expected as much.

00:11:33.152 --> 00:11:35.991
[DIAMANTE] So, needless to say,
we weren't able to use

00:11:36.024 --> 00:11:37.595
her Glare-Glare power
to figure out

00:11:37.628 --> 00:11:39.264
what the Straw Hats were up to.

00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:41.603
Still in the dark
on that, I'm afraid.

00:11:41.636 --> 00:11:44.207
[DOFLAMINGO] Don't worry,
it's all under control.

00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:46.012
So, here's the deal.

00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:48.082
I need you to deploy
Lao G and the others

00:11:48.115 --> 00:11:49.986
to the entrance of
the SMILE Factory.

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:52.023
[DIAMANTE]
Whoa-whoa, no can do!

00:11:52.057 --> 00:11:53.827
We've already announced
that those guys'll be

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.430
participating in the finals--

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:56.633
The crowd's gonna be angry.

00:11:56.666 --> 00:11:59.237
[DOFLAMINGO] They've got you!
That's more than enough!

00:11:59.271 --> 00:12:01.709
Stop! You make it sound like
I'm some kinda genius!

00:12:01.743 --> 00:12:03.514
[DOFLAMINGO] That's exactly
what you are, my friend!

00:12:03.547 --> 00:12:06.118
No, no, I'm nothing
of the sort, honestly!

00:12:06.151 --> 00:12:08.356
[DOFLAMINGO] You're the
only one who can do this.

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:12.665
Fine, I'm a genius--
You can count on me! Whoo!

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:14.602
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Cu-lick.

00:12:14.635 --> 00:12:17.274
[LAW] Damn it, are you
toying with me?

00:12:17.307 --> 00:12:18.977
[DOFLAMINGO]
Is that a problem?

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.484
You're trying to act as a decoy
to keep me busy, aren't you?

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:23.653
And in the meantime,

00:12:23.687 --> 00:12:26.426
the Straw Hats are planning
to destroy my factory.

00:12:26.459 --> 00:12:27.862
Even if you die here,

00:12:27.895 --> 00:12:31.335
as long as the factory's
destroyed, your plan succeeds.

00:12:31.368 --> 00:12:33.641
Because Kaido will kill me
when I can no longer

00:12:33.674 --> 00:12:35.745
produce SMILEs for him.

00:12:35.778 --> 00:12:38.550
That's how your
scenario goes, isn't it?

00:12:39.652 --> 00:12:41.956
But you used up
your power too quickly

00:12:41.989 --> 00:12:44.261
and hardly bought
any time at all.

00:12:44.294 --> 00:12:47.467
The Straw Hats can't seem
to pull it together, either.

00:12:50.006 --> 00:12:52.745
[DOFLAMINGO] You went on about
how you were just using them.

00:12:52.778 --> 00:12:54.314
But if you didn't have
the utmost faith

00:12:54.348 --> 00:12:55.884
in Straw Hat and his crew,

00:12:55.917 --> 00:12:58.991
then the plan would never
work in the first place.

00:12:59.024 --> 00:13:01.228
So where does that come from?

00:13:01.262 --> 00:13:03.767
Why do you trust that kid?

00:13:07.473 --> 00:13:12.918
Because I know that the D
will bring a new storm.

00:13:54.535 --> 00:13:56.773
So? What'd you
need me for, Zoro?

00:13:56.806 --> 00:13:58.577
First off. There's a
tournament going on

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.348
and you didn't even tell me!
I wanna fight, too, you know!

00:14:01.381 --> 00:14:03.352
[LUFFY chuckles]
Oops. Sorry.

00:14:03.386 --> 00:14:05.290
I've been running around
town like a damn fool,

00:14:05.323 --> 00:14:06.559
while you're having fun!

00:14:06.592 --> 00:14:09.599
Now, now, that's not what
we came here for, Sir Zoro.

00:14:09.632 --> 00:14:10.867
[ZORO] By the way,
I can't believe you were

00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:12.838
letting that old man
kick your ass!

00:14:12.872 --> 00:14:14.407
What were you doing?

00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:16.379
[LUFFY] I beat him in the end!
Didn't you see my...

00:14:16.412 --> 00:14:19.117
That's him. No mistaking it!

00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:24.428
[MARINE A]
Vice Admiral Bastille!

00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:27.500
As I thought, that was
Pirate Hunter Zoro back there.

00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:29.539
And the guy in the
coliseum he's talking to--

00:14:29.572 --> 00:14:32.410
I'm almost positive
that's Straw Hat Luffy!

00:14:32.443 --> 00:14:34.682
[BASTILLE] So he was
the winner from Block C?

00:14:34.716 --> 00:14:39.391
"Lucy," right? Well, that
explains why he was so strong.

00:14:39.424 --> 00:14:41.362
Then it looks like
Smoker had it right--

00:14:41.395 --> 00:14:44.101
The Straw Hats are in Dressrosa.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:45.738
Should we capture them?

00:14:45.771 --> 00:14:48.977
No. Let's leave them be for now.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.881
Think about it for a second.

00:14:50.915 --> 00:14:54.722
As we speak, that coliseum is
swimming with infamous pirates,

00:14:54.755 --> 00:14:57.127
deadly bounty hunters,
and mercenaries

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.164
from the all over New World.

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:01.536
Sure, we could burst in
there and capture Straw Hat,

00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:03.172
but that would make a scene.

00:15:03.205 --> 00:15:06.078
We don't want to
alert the others yet.

00:15:06.112 --> 00:15:08.249
If we wait for all of
those snakes to slither

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:09.919
their way out of the coliseum,

00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:12.357
they'll fall
right into our trap.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:16.498
Then we can capture the lot
of them in one fell swoop.

00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:18.671
Well, let's see who's
been eliminated.

00:15:18.704 --> 00:15:20.574
Biggest is Don Chin Jao.

00:15:20.607 --> 00:15:22.511
Then there's...

00:15:22.544 --> 00:15:25.483
Who's Sai? Boo? And Abdullah?

00:15:25.518 --> 00:15:28.957
I wrote this down, but I
don't know them at all.

00:15:28.991 --> 00:15:30.728
Any of these names
ring a bell to you?

00:15:30.761 --> 00:15:34.835
[BASTILLE] Huh? Is that supposed
to be some kind of joke?

00:15:34.869 --> 00:15:36.272
They're famous criminals,

00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:39.244
known for running wild
in the New World!

00:15:42.383 --> 00:15:43.687
Who did you say?

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.494
Oh, um, Sai,
Boo, and Abdullah.

00:15:47.528 --> 00:15:49.198
[MARINE A]
They're famous, huh?

00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:50.601
[MARINE B]
Don't know 'em.

00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:52.738
[MARINE C]
That's weird.

00:15:52.771 --> 00:15:55.677
Actually, can't say those names
ring a bell, after all.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.082
Hmm. Wait a sec.

00:15:58.115 --> 00:16:01.923
Who were we supposed
to capture again? Hmm.

00:16:01.956 --> 00:16:04.829
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL B ringing]

00:16:04.862 --> 00:16:06.833
Am I using this snail correctly?

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:08.469
What're you trying to do?

00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:11.710
Sir Sanji requested that I call
him once we found Sir Luffy.

00:16:11.743 --> 00:16:14.281
I see. Oh, and Luffy!

00:16:14.314 --> 00:16:15.349
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:16:15.383 --> 00:16:16.987
[ZORO] The coliseum is
surrounded by Marines,

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.258
by the way.

00:16:19.291 --> 00:16:22.598
[KIN'EMON] That was our big news
and you don't even care?

00:16:22.631 --> 00:16:23.766
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL C ringing]

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.837
[CHOPPER] Sanji! The
Transponder Snail is ringing!

00:16:25.871 --> 00:16:27.508
[SANJI]
Huh? Must be Kin'emon.

00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:28.375
[MOMONOSUKE]
If that's the case,

00:16:28.408 --> 00:16:29.945
then please allow
me to answer it!

00:16:29.979 --> 00:16:32.150
[BROOK]
No, this is business!

00:16:32.183 --> 00:16:33.653
This is the Sunny here!

00:16:33.686 --> 00:16:35.422
[LUFFY]
Hey, Sanji, it's me!

00:16:35.456 --> 00:16:36.592
Hi, Luffy!

00:16:36.626 --> 00:16:39.331
All right, Chopper, now call
Usopp on the other one.

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:41.268
[CHOPPER]
On it.

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:42.036
'Kay!

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:46.078
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL D ringing]

00:16:46.111 --> 00:16:46.879
Cu-lick.

00:16:46.913 --> 00:16:48.517
This is Usopp! Hey!

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.019
That's everybody!

00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:51.154
We're missing Law,

00:16:51.187 --> 00:16:53.426
but he can catch up with
the news later, I'm sure.

00:16:53.459 --> 00:16:55.797
Okay, you guys. It's Sanji!

00:16:55.831 --> 00:16:58.937
We've got Nami, Chopper,
Brook, and Momonosuke here.

00:16:58.971 --> 00:17:00.607
And Caesar, I guess.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.912
Give us a status update, please.

00:17:02.945 --> 00:17:05.984
Right, this is Kin'emon.
I'm with Sir Luffy.

00:17:06.017 --> 00:17:09.091
And Sir Zoro as well,
in front of the coliseum.

00:17:09.124 --> 00:17:11.830
All right. So what
about you, Usopp?

00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:13.098
[USOPP]
For starters, we--

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:16.371
Wow! This is Franky here!
Kickin' it with Usopp and Robin!

00:17:16.404 --> 00:17:17.441
[USOPP]
Gimme a break!

00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:19.111
Okay, check this out.

00:17:19.144 --> 00:17:20.614
We made some friends.

00:17:20.647 --> 00:17:23.019
Guys that call themselves
the King Riku Army,

00:17:23.052 --> 00:17:25.222
sworn enemies of Doflamingo.

00:17:25.256 --> 00:17:26.191
[SANJI]
An army?

00:17:26.224 --> 00:17:27.159
Of Little People.

00:17:27.193 --> 00:17:28.395
[LUFFY]
Really?

00:17:28.428 --> 00:17:30.734
[LEO] Hey, Usoland! What are
you doing over there, huh?

00:17:30.767 --> 00:17:34.007
[gasps] It's a hero meeting!
A top-secret one!

00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:34.876
[ALL gasp]

00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:36.044
Understood!

00:17:36.078 --> 00:17:37.848
[ALL]
Please excuse us, sir!

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.752
[sighs]

00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:42.223
[FRANKY] Anyway, Luffy,
here's the thing.

00:17:42.256 --> 00:17:43.760
You remember that
Toy Soldier dude

00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:46.031
we met in front of
the coliseum earlier?

00:17:46.064 --> 00:17:48.369
Uh-huh. But about
the Little People!

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:49.805
It turns out

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:52.376
that toy is the commander
of this here army.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:53.614
[LUFFY]
Of the Little People?

00:17:53.647 --> 00:17:55.250
Yeah.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:57.588
And the thing is,
this army is planning on

00:17:57.622 --> 00:18:02.164
taking down Doflamingo,
like pronto. Today even.

00:18:02.197 --> 00:18:03.700
Hold on.

00:18:03.733 --> 00:18:05.871
[REBECCA] I believe that
he can save this kingdom.

00:18:05.905 --> 00:18:08.309
But he wants to sacrifice
his life to do it!

00:18:08.342 --> 00:18:10.847
Hey! I heard something
about that soldier!

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.853
Earlier, Rebecca said
she wants to stop him!

00:18:13.887 --> 00:18:16.191
Don't do it!
Tell the army to wait!

00:18:16.224 --> 00:18:17.595
[FRANKY]
Not a chance!

00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:19.799
We need to do the
exact opposite of that!

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:22.103
So wait, you said you
talked to Rebecca?

00:18:22.137 --> 00:18:23.840
[LUFFY]
Yeah! And she's really nice,

00:18:23.874 --> 00:18:25.309
so I want to help her out!

00:18:25.342 --> 00:18:28.482
Even though she's poor,
she bought me three lunchboxes!

00:18:28.516 --> 00:18:31.923
But when she went to fight,
the whole audience hated her!

00:18:31.957 --> 00:18:33.225
They don't know anything!

00:18:33.259 --> 00:18:36.231
[FRANKY] Yeah. I'm with you
on that one, brother.

00:18:39.437 --> 00:18:42.945
[FRANKY]
Luffy. I'm sorry.

00:18:42.979 --> 00:18:45.517
But I don't think I can
follow Traffy's plan.

00:18:45.551 --> 00:18:46.786
[ALL gasp]

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.957
[USOPP] Whoa, Franky,
where'd that come from?

00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:52.096
Let me lay this out
how I remember it.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.868
We're s'pposed to destroy
the SMILE factory,

00:18:54.902 --> 00:18:58.041
but then we keep Doflamingo
around to use against Kaido?

00:18:58.075 --> 00:18:59.779
Nah, man.

00:18:59.813 --> 00:19:02.050
It just ain't fair.

00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:03.152
What happens to all the people

00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:05.489
who wanna take
that bastard down?

00:19:06.592 --> 00:19:08.863
[FRANKY]
We can't stop 'em, anyway.

00:19:08.896 --> 00:19:11.769
Even though this kingdom
seems like a happy place,

00:19:11.803 --> 00:19:14.708
these guys know how
dark it really is.

00:19:14.742 --> 00:19:17.346
And right now, they're
getting ready to strike down

00:19:17.379 --> 00:19:19.150
that darkness with
all they've got,

00:19:19.183 --> 00:19:21.589
even if it costs
them their lives!

00:19:23.125 --> 00:19:27.466
Sure, they're small, but they've
got some really big balls!

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.873
This little army is
brave as hell,

00:19:29.906 --> 00:19:33.246
staring down an enemy
that's pure evil!

00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:38.455
I can't just leave 'em
to die. I'm sorry.

00:19:40.961 --> 00:19:43.498
[FRANKY] It's not right to just
destroy the factory and bail.

00:19:43.533 --> 00:19:46.872
As long as Doflamingo's
in charge, that's bad news.

00:19:49.177 --> 00:19:53.653
Luffy! I think you're a
great captain and all, but...

00:19:58.763 --> 00:20:01.168
...I gotta fight!

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:02.738
Wow, Franky.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.279
[REBECCA] He won't make it
this time. He'll die.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.453
[LUFFY]
Franky!

00:20:10.486 --> 00:20:12.557
Kick some ass out there!

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.697
We'll back you up real soon!

00:20:17.768 --> 00:20:20.841
[FRANKY]
Wow! Thanks, brother!

00:20:20.874 --> 00:20:23.546
All right. We're heading back.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.350
[BROOK, CHOPPER, NAMI]
What?

00:20:25.383 --> 00:20:27.721
It always ends up this way!

00:20:27.754 --> 00:20:28.823
[MARINES scream]

00:20:28.856 --> 00:20:30.459
[MARINE E gasps]
What's that?

00:20:30.492 --> 00:20:33.231
[MARINE F]
Is the city under attack?

00:20:33.265 --> 00:20:37.273
[MARINE G] Issho, sir, there's a
big fight happening in the city!

00:20:37.306 --> 00:20:39.076
We'd better hurry.

00:20:41.882 --> 00:20:43.018
[USOPP]
That was loud!

00:20:43.052 --> 00:20:45.122
You got something
going on over there?

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.997
This does not look promising.

00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:07.868
And it's coming this way.

00:21:11.174 --> 00:21:11.909
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:11.942 --> 00:21:14.380
What just happened? I can't see!

00:21:14.413 --> 00:21:15.683
You guys okay?

00:21:15.717 --> 00:21:16.786
What the?

00:21:16.819 --> 00:21:18.556
[MARINE OFFICER A]
Uhm, Vice Admiral Bastille?

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.425
Follow me, Marines.

00:21:34.522 --> 00:21:36.725
[BASTILLE]
What the hell is happening?

00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:06.685
[LUFFY]
Doflamingo!

00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:09.223
[LUFFY]
Traffy!

00:22:11.563 --> 00:22:13.131
Damn brat.

00:22:15.002 --> 00:22:19.076
What's going on? Traffy!
Why are you fighting with Mingo?

00:22:31.602 --> 00:22:34.106
You just had to push your luck.

00:23:00.527 --> 00:23:03.699

Cora... I--

00:23:04.502 --> 00:23:07.674
[LUFFY]
Traffy!

[NARRATOR] After Luffy's
group of allied pirates

00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:18.630
find themselves
fenced in by the Navy,

00:23:18.663 --> 00:23:20.967
the Straw Hats finally
spring into action.

Retrieving Law,
destroying the factory,

00:23:23.439 --> 00:23:24.942
and Rebecca's wish.

00:23:24.976 --> 00:23:26.879
Thinking of all these
things inspires Luffy

00:23:26.912 --> 00:23:30.252
to let out a mighty battle cry
before the final round.

00:23:30.286 --> 00:23:31.889
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.922 --> 00:23:34.060
"Two Great Rivals
Meet Each Other!

00:23:34.093 --> 00:23:36.364
Straw Hat and Heavenly Demon!"

00:23:36.397 --> 00:23:38.970
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
