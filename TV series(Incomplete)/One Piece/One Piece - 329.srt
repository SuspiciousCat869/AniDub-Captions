Travel across the oceans of the world

00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,424
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:42,328
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

39
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,565
and everything else
the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:50,570
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,739
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

42
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,840
You can have it!

43
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:57,410
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

44
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,180
Now you just have to find it!

45
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,583
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

46
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,586
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

47
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,856
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

48
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,693
[NARRATOR] On the
glacier-covered sea

49
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,361
known as the Frozen Highway,

50
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,865
the Accino family
confronted the Straw Hat crew.

51
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,900
Looks like we finally found you!

52
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:23,770
Going somewhere?

53
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,538
Don't you know that
when a ship is lost

54
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,941
on the Frozen Highway,
it's destined to wander

55
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,542
for all eternity?

56
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,644
Just give up already!

57
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,246
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, Luffy and Chopper

58
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,948
bid their farewells
to Puzzle's crew

59
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,317
as they prepared to
return to the Sunny.

60
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,454
[yelling]

61
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,461
The Sunny! It disappeared!

62
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,632
[NARRATOR] The crew on the
Sunny made a last ditch effort

63
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,235
to escape the icebergs
that had blocked them in.

64
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,639
[FRANKY]
Coup de...

65
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,741

[confused yelling]

67
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,616
[NARRATOR]
To prevent their escape,

68
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,652
the Accino family
employed a new strategy.

69
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,588
They won't leave
without their flag.

70
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,961
[FLYING FISH cooing]

71
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,497
What a strange fish.

00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,985
[NAMI] Our Jolly Roger...

76
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,787
[SANJI] It just disappeared.

77
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,855
[FRANKY]
How long's it been gone?

78
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:49,989
[USOPP] No, where did it go?

79
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,559
It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
gone, gone, gone, gone!

80
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,233
Now go! Flying fish!

81
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:05,638
[FLYING FISH cooing]

82
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,711
[FRANKY] What's wrong, Robin?

83
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:12,812
That's absurd.

84
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,882
Huh? Is there something
over there I'm not seeing?

85
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,389
[FLYING FISH cooing]

86
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,824
There it is, I see the flag!

87
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:25,992
Where is it?

88
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,860
It looks like some
weird bird-fish thing

89
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,595
has got a hold of it.

90
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,397
I thought so.

91
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,899
Those same people
we've been dealing with

92
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,068
are the ones who stole it.

93
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,403
I saw the little one
commanding that bird fish

94
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,504
before we got out of there.

95
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,707
[FLYING FISH squawking]

96
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,710
It's taking the flag
right back to the icebergs!

97
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,577
[SANJI] Dammit!

98
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,045
[NAMI] Hey, Sanji!

99
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,588
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

100
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,956
Is it that
tough to figure out?

101
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,591
I'm getting our flag back!

102
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,059
I am not in
the mood for jokes!

103
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,894
We barely made it
out of that place!

104
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,429
Calm down and think, Sanji!

105
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,565
We don't even know where
Luffy and Chopper are!

106
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,766
Same with Zoro!

107
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,900
The best thing to do right now

108
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,870
is stay put
until we can regroup!

109
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,038
Stay put, dammit!

110
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,773
Stop moving! I mean it!

111
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,641
Listen to me,
you stupid iceberg!

112
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,378
Hey! Stop moving!

113
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,647
I'm sorry, but we
can't afford to sit still.

114
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,784
A pirate flag is more
important than a pirate's life.

115
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,653
And there is no greater shame
than allowing it to be stolen.

116
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,755
I get that,
but don't you think

117
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,957
we should find our captain
before we go off and--

118
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,426
You're not
listening to me, dammit!

119
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,762
Think, you guys.

120
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,964
Do you want to be the one
to tell the captain

121
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,632
we lost the flag?

122
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,104
Geez. You're all helpless.

123
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,407
Really. You disgust me.

124
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,976
No! Keep steering!

125
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,111
There's no way I'm telling him!

126
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,447
[USOPP, NAMI] I absolutely
refuse to be scolded

127
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,949
by that idiot!

128
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,818
That's their reason? Really?

129
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,453
[ROBIN giggling]

130
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,655
All right! Let's do this!

131
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,597
Again? Seriously?

132
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,868
What is up with this ice?

133
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,970
Why won't it stop moving?

134
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,639
[NAMI] It doesn't look
like we're going anywhere

135
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,808
until we figure out what's
making these icebergs

136
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,010
act this way.

137
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,211
--Franky?
--[FRANKY] Huh?

138
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,548
You feel up to doing a little
reconnaissance work with me?

139
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,526
Sneaky jerks.

140
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,995
Where in the hell
could they have gone?

141
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,467
You can try,

142
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,635
but there's no escaping
Hockera the great.

143
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,871
I will hunt you down.

144
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,506
[HOCKERA shouts]

145
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,042
[SALCHOW, ARBELL]
La, lala, la, la!

146
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,549
I'm having a blast, but
we're wasting time, honey.

147
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,718
We should be out on the
ice lookin' for those guys.

148
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,720
Haste causes waste, darling.

149
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,755
They can run all they like,
but remember:

150
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,925
there's no way they can
escape the Frozen Highway!

151
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,894
So, I say we enjoy it!

152
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,029
Lovely!
Just downright lovely!

153
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,232
And so are you, honey!

154
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:21,834
Although...

155
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,536
It is quite odd we've
been looking this long

156
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,737
and haven't found them.

157
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,205
It does somewhat boggle the mind

158
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,508
as to where
they could be hiding.

159
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,447
Soldier Dock System...
Channel Three!

160
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,270
Right! This is
Shark Submerge Number Three.

161
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,071
Now dispatching!

162
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,989
[laughing]

163
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,090
Pretty super, huh?

164
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,993
Nothin' quite like riding
in a Shark Submarine.

165
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,795
Can't deny it, can you?

166
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,130
Sanji, am I coming through?

167
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,098
Thanks for ignoring me.

168
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,668
Yeah, I can hear you
loud and clear, Nami.

169
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,003
So, you guys seeing
anything down there?

170
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,573
Um... I doubt we're
gonna find anything

171
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,608
until we descend
a little further.

172
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,811
Franky, can you take us down
underneath the icebergs?

173
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,112
[FRANKY] You got it!

174
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,086
[NAMI]
Huh? What's that?

175
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,688
What's goin' on, Nami?

176
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,123
So did you spot
somethin' out there?

177
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,993
Can you lower the speed
so I can get a better look?

178
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,263
[NAMI] Stop right here!

179
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,334
[NAMI]
What in the world is that?

180
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,646
I think we found 'em!

181
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,347
Found what?

182
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,848
I have no idea!

183
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:16,682
What?

184
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,818
They saw us!
They're headed this way!

185
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,152
What is headed this way?

186
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,954
Just turn around!

187
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,222
[NAMI screaming]

188
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,690
Hey! What's happening?

189
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,891
Answer me!

190
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:30,863
What the hell?!

191
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,865
[NAMI] Increase the speed!

192
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,808
[SANJI] Damn! Nami!

193
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,577
Come back!

194
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,719
[screaming]

195
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,926
He's too far!

196
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,065
What the--?

197
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,068
And there you are.

198
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,070
Let's go.

199
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,339
Wait for me, honey!

200
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,286
[USOPP] Pain...

201
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,062
Man, did we
really fall that far?

202
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,470
[USOPP] How adorable!

203
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,406
Just look at this
cute little penguin!

204
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,108
Cute little penguin!

205
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:55,948
[USOPP yelling in pain]

206
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,917
[USOPP] My hand!

207
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,153
[SANJI] Look up.

208
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,455
[USOPP screams]

209
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,890
[USOPP]
There's hundreds of them!

210
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,296
What do we do?

211
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,298
There's only one thing to do.

212
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,267
We run like
we've never run before.

213
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,839
[USOPP screaming]

214
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,241
[SANJI] Geez!
What's wrong with these things?

215
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,244
[USOPP] Bloodthirsty monsters!

216
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,812
[USOPP] Save me!

217
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,424
Perfect!

218
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,292
Now I can get back to the Sunny.

219
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,329
[CHOPPER] Domo Penguins?

220
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,296
[STANSEN] That's right.

221
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,865
They're a strong and
vicious breed of penguin

222
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,099
native to this area.

223
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,169
The way the icebergs move
around, that's all their work.

224
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,804
Cool!

225
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,973
Not really, when
you consider their purpose.

226
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,040
The whole reason why they do it

227
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,877
is to help the bounty hunters
catch their targets.

228
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:01,480
It turns the ocean here into
a shifting, inescapable maze.

229
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,448
That's not cool.

230
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,983
[LUFFY]
Hey!

231
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,217
[LUFFY]
Chopper!

232
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,386
It's time to head back
to the Sunny!

233
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,554
[CHOPPER] Coming!

234
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,225
[CHOPPER]
Thank you for everything. Bye!

235
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,560
--[STANSEN] Hey!
--[PUZZLE] Forget it.

236
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,396
[PUZZLE] Just let 'em leave.

237
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,366
It's gonna be the same
wherever they go.

238
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,634
They may have hope now,

239
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:25,971
but no one can change their fate
once they've entered this place.

240
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,840
You know it's true.

241
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,547
[CHOPPER] Thanks again, guys!

242
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,149
See ya!

243
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,259
[PUZZLE] What's wrong?

244
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,268
[BRINDO] Well, look at this.

245
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:00,339
I'd heard that you were a
dead man, but here you are.

246
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,508
Ohohohoho!

247
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,446
It is a pleasure
to finally meet you.

248
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:12,017
Puzzle, our elusive
little phoenix.

249
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:40,913
[SANJI and USOPP panting]

250
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,148
I don't know how...

251
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,651
But I think we lost 'em.

252
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,586
I just wanna know
what they are.

253
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,455
They're not normal penguins.

254
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,625
[ARBELL, SALCHOW]
La, lala, la la!

255
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,327
La, lala, la la!

256
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,666
Not again. How'd they find us?

257
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,169
You people don't disappoint...
...when it comes to stupidity.

258
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,473
I told you it was impossible
to escape, but did you listen?

259
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,243
I feared I would
never see you again.

260
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,445
Such astounding beauty.

261
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,080
Get away from me.

262
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,656
Gahh! Too close!

263
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,159
Nice kicks.

264
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,195
You really are a
woman after my heart.

265
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,331
Well, at least
you've got good taste.

266
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,099
But it's going to take
a lot more than that

267
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,369
to escape this time, seeing
as we've got you cornered!

268
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,039
So cool!

269
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,041
You really are amazing, honey!

270
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,209
Why thank you, my darling!

271
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,179
Quit rubbin' it in my face!

272
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,114
Cut it out, dammit!

273
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,382
[SANJI] Have some decency!

274
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,285
--We're in public! Knock it off!
--[USOPP] These people. I swear.

275
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,393
I thought we were
dead for sure.

276
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,996
Yeah. That wasn't too super.

277
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,001
What now?

278
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,669
Show yourself, coward!

279
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,638
[HOCKERA]
Hoh ke ke ke!

280
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,140
It took a while,
but I've found you!

281
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,376
[FRANKY] And what the hell
are you supposed to be?

282
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,344
[HOCKERA] I'm Hockera,

283
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:21,347
the third son of the
glorious Accino family.

284
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,416
The two of you will make
a nice present for my papa!

285
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,151
[NAMI] A present for your papa?

286
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,653
What does that even mean?

287
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,693
Ke ke ke ke!

288
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,430
I'm gonna put you two
on ice, permanently.

289
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,431
[NAMI] Franky!

290
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,038
You're quite the
cocky little bastard.

291
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,673
Well, if you're in the
mood to play rough,

292
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,575
then you found the right guy.

293
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,610
Bring it on, kiddo.

294
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,455
[LIL laughing]

295
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,290
Will you play with me?

296
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,226
It'll be fun.

297
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,529
Who're you, exactly?

298
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,698
My name is Lil.

299
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,801
So, you do wanna play, right?

300
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,576
[CHOPPER] I hope the rest
of the crew is all right.

301
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,644
[LUFFY] Come on,

302
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,980
you know you don't have
to worry about those guys.

303
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,548
By the way,
you haven't told me

304
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,550
the directions to
get back to the Sunny.

305
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,452
--Do you know which way it is?
--Nope!

306
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,720
So you meant
we should be worrying

307
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,622
about ourselves instead?!

308
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,726
[CHOPPER]
It's pushing us backwards!

309
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,797
[LUFFY]
What's with these stupid bergs?

310
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,901
[BRINDO] Ohohohoho!
The name fits you

311
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,903
since you've risen
from the grave.

312
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,773
But I'm here to make sure that
you don't rise up a second time.

313
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,342
[STANSEN]
Wait! Please don't do this!

314
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,644
You've got it all wrong!

315
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:02,081
This little guy here isn't
the captain of our ship.

316
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,983
He's just an injured landlubber
we've been taking care of.

317
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,653
The captain has been dead
for quite a while now--

318
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,758
You little rat.

319
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,494
Do you really think
you can deceive me?

320
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,362
Well, you'll pay for trying!

321
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,536
Stansen!

322
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,471
What's happening?

323
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,839
What's all the ruckus out here?

324
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,107
Stansen!

325
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,109
Are you all right?

326
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:33,011
How's it feel?
You stickin' to your story?

327
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,947
Still wanna tell me
this landlubber

328
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,949
isn't really your captain?

329
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:50,462
[VIGARO] Listen.
I believe in you, Puzzle.

330
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,532
You're the man who'll be
King of the Pirates!

331
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,968
[PUZZLE]
Vigaro! No! Don't do this!

332
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,811
[JIRO] Captain!

333
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,379
Why're you standing here?

334
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,548
Hurry up and beat
the crap out of that guy!

335
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,883
C'mon, Captain! Please!

336
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,385
Ohohohoho!

337
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,387
That little kid
just gave you away.

338
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,756
Now quit denying you're
the ship's captain.

339
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,925
You've got a one hundred
million Berry bounty

340
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,094
on your head,
and I'm here to collect it.

341
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,596
Now comes the fun part.

342
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,831
With a bounty like that,

343
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,900
you have to be worth
something in battle.

344
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,735
Don't disappoint me.

345
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,006
[JIRO] What's wrong with you?

346
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,441
Captain, come on!

347
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,676
Ah, yes.

348
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,046
Didn't you have the Straw Hat
captain on board, as well?

349
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,849
[BRINDO] You've got him
hidden somewhere, don't you?

350
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,851
Huh? Answer me!

351
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,788
--Hey, let him go!
--Stansen!

352
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,124
Captain!
What's wrong with you?

353
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,860
You aren't acting like
yourself at all! C'mon!

354
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,430
Help him!
Do something, Captain!

355
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:04,203
--Damn it!
--[LUFFY] Hey! We're back again!

356
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,905
[BRINDO]
What the hell...?

357
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,212
Sorry!

358
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,647
Some stuff happened, and we
ended up coming here again.

359
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,217
Uh, what kind of stuff?

360
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,586
I thought you guys
went back to your ship!

361
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,054
[CHOPPER] Can we just
say it was icebergs?

362
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,489
'Cause the truth is
kind of embarrassing.

363
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,926
We didn't have a single
clue where we were going.

364
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,927
Uh...

365
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,630
They didn't think
about that before leaving?

366
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,065
Guess not.

367
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,102
Ohohoho!

368
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,070
Oh, well.

369
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,472
I can't imagine it'd
be easy to find a ship

370
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,573
without a flag, anyway.

371
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,743
Quite honestly, you might
not even recognize it.

372
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,012
A flag is quite
important, huh, Straw Hat?

373
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,948
[BRINDO] I'm having quite
the lucky day, though.

374
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,650
Who'd've thought
I'd run into two men

375
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,252
with such high bounties
as yourselves?

376
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,519
[CHOPPER] That's three men!

377
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,254
So, uh...

378
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,755
Who is this guy, anyway?

379
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,257
[BRINDO] Oh, how rude of me.

380
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,093
I'm the second son
of the Accino family.

381
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,861
The name's Brindo.

382
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,263
Hey, Stansen, what's
wrong with you, huh?

383
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,031
I'm talking!

384
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,767
Now listen. Let me
spell it out for you.

385
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,004
We took your ship's Jolly Roger
and added it to our collection.

386
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,138
[CHOPPER] Your collection?

387
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,041
I rather thought I'd get
more of a reaction than that.

388
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,278
Don't you care that
we stole your flag?

389
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,614
Our flag. You stole it?

390
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,950
Are they the ones
that stole our flag, too?

391
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,018
Ohohoho!

392
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,954
You'd be better off
just giving up now, anyway.

393
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,057
Seeing how easily we swiped that
flag from your useless crew,

394
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,226
you wouldn't make it
very far in the first place.

395
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,727
Not with them.

396
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,229
[BRINDO] Ohohohoho!

397
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,532
Ohoho, ohoho, ohohoho!

398
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,139
Listen.

399
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,006
I don't know
what kind of pirates

400
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,575
you guys have been
picking fights with,

401
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,678
but we're not
giving up that easy.

402
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,048
Tell me--Where's our flag?

403
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,582
Well, by this point,

404
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,652
I'm sure your flag
is in Lovely Land.

405
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,154
If you really want it back,

406
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,090
you're gonna have
to go get it yourself.

407
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,559
Uh... Lovely Land?

408
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,234
So... cold...

409
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,849
Just what am I looking at?

410
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,265
[LUFFY] You bastard!

411
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:23,335
I'm sick of your stupid laugh.
Now give us back our flag!

412
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,336
[CHOPPER] That flag.

413
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,905
It's the symbol of pride
that binds us together.

414
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,407
And I won't let you have it!

415
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,808
[LUFFY] Hold on, dammit!

416
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,410
[CHOPPER]
Luffy, run! It's falling!

417
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,412
[LUFFY screaming]

418
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,080
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

419
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,015
The Straw Hat's Hard Battles.

420
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,918
A Pirate Soul Risking
it All for the Flag!

421
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,654
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
