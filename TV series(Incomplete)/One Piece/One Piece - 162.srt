Never.

83
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:11,092
They are basically
just criminals

85
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:15,722
And though each ship
may vary somewhat,

86
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:18,516
these pirates are usually
recognized by their flag

That's absurd!

You mean that these

call that criminal.

136
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,267

the day the Upper Yard,

138
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:29,314

forth a beautiful song

140
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:33,985
It was after that moment

[CHOPPER]
Go out! Go out already! Come on!

182
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:36,418
[SHURA] I don't see why you
care so much about a ship

183
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:38,837
that no one is going
to sail on again.

184
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:43,258
Death will find you as surely
as it will find your friends

185
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,843
who left you here alone.

00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:46,386
I don't even know who you are!

from my friends!

[yells] Just stop
burning the ship!

Oh, no. Oh, no!

If you want me, that's fine!

207
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:04,297
But you can't have the ship!

208
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:06,966
They put me in charge of it,
and I'm not letting them down,

209
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,262
so you back off now,
mister! [whimpers]

[SHURA] What do you think
we should do, Fuza?

211
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:16,685

{\an8}[squawks]

213
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,773
[SHURA] He doesn't want us
to hurt any of his friends,

214
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:24,025
he's begging us not
to torch his ship,

215
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:28,154
and he says, of course,
that he doesn't want to die.

00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:29,698
{\an8}I'm at a loss here.

pick up the pace?

[NAMI] Shut up! Stop it!
You're distracting me!

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,403
What if I slip and fall, huh?

227
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:53,031
I'll be dead! And then
how would you feel?

[NAMI]
Sorry for being such a pain.

00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,274
Thanks for grabbing me.

238
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:29,818
No problem.

239
00:14:37,283 --> 00:14:38,076
[ZORO]
What is it?

240
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,203
No more monsters, I hope.

241
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:42,455
It looks like... a well.

242
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:43,790
A well?

243
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,505
[SHURA]
Let me get this straight.

244
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:53,925
Your friends, this ship,
and your life--

245
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:56,261
You don't want to
lose any of that.

246
00:14:57,846 --> 00:14:58,972
[CHOPPER gasps]

247
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:00,140
Then...

248
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:02,517
...why don't you try
putting up a fight?!

249
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,602
[CHOPPER gasps]
Your spear!

250
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:06,646
It's burning through the metal!

251
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:13,028
[CHOPPER screaming]

252
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:14,738
Hot! Hot!

253
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:17,699
Why's he burning
everything?! [screams]

254
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:19,409
[CHOPPER]
You creep!

255
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:22,412
[yells, gasps]

256
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:26,041
[SHURA] Are you trying
to survive this...

257
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:29,210
...without sacrificing
anything of yourself?

258
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:31,212
[CHOPPER] There's more to
this guy than he's showing me.

259
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:32,756
He's not just a fighter.

260
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:35,258
It's like he can predict
all of my moves!

261
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:40,638
[SHURA] For one to live,
another must die.

262
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:43,016
That is the way of the world.

263
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:45,977
This is a sacrificial altar.

264
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:49,564
[SHURA] What did you
think was going to happen

265
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,067
by you being up here?

266
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,401
[CHOPPER]
I was supposed to fix the ship

267
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,987
and wait until my
crewmates came back.

268
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:58,365
[SHURA] Be assured, your friends
are trying their hardest

269
00:15:58,448 --> 00:15:59,908
to get back here.

270
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:03,453
Of course, they're going to
find it incredibly difficult.

271
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:06,081
On this island
there are four areas,

272
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:10,085
{\an8}each of which is governed
by a different priest.

273
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:13,296
{\an8}Our first rule is that when
the targets are in one area,

274
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,924
{\an8}the other priests are not
supposed to interfere with them

275
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:17,884
{\an8}in any way.

276
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:20,136
{\an8}But this sacrificial altar

277
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,556
{\an8}doesn't sit inside the
perimeter of any of the areas.

278
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,184
{\an8}Here, we are in a free zone.

279
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:30,230
Which means that any one of us
can attack those we find here.

280
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:33,400
And proper etiquette would not
have those at the altar killed

281
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:37,278
until after the targets fail
at a challenge and die.

282
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:40,824
What?! Luffy and the
others are dead?!

283
00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:42,242
Calm yourself.

284
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:44,869
The fact that I am here
does not necessarily mean

285
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:47,080
your friends are
dead at this point.

286
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:49,332
It's unfortunate but true.

287
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,750
I stand before you now

288
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:53,420
with a different purpose
than sacrifice.

289
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,630
[CHOPPER]
What's different about it?

290
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,717
Wait. You mean if my friends
get back here and rescue me,

291
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,884
then we're free to go.

292
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,095
But you won't let
that happen, will you?

293
00:17:02,178 --> 00:17:04,848
Well, that depends on you

294
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:07,017
and whether you and your
crew can make your escape

295
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,977
from the free zone fast enough.

296
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,228
[CHOPPER]
What?

297
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:12,147
[SHURA]
But hold that thought.

298
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,150
The reason I'm here is because
those are the judgment rules

299
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,110
under normal conditions.

300
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:20,196
However, when there is
an exceptional situation,

301
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,449
the rules are set
to change a little.

302
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:23,825
Exceptional?

303
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:26,661
Yes. Exceptional.

304
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,079
Say, for example,

305
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:30,290
three sacrifices were
to escape the altar

306
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:32,834
and swing to the main
island using vines.

307
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:36,296
[CHOPPER]
Oh, that kind of situation.

308
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:37,797
[ZORO]
I say we should cross over

309
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:40,592
and see what's on the
other side of the river.

310
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:44,471
[ZORO yelling]

311
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,561
[CHOPPER]
It's all his fault!

312
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:54,230
[ZORO yelling]

313
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:57,692
[ZORO] I wonder what
crawled into her knapsack,

314
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,819
wandering off ahead like that.

315
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:02,113
It's immature is what it is.

316
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:05,116
If this is a thinly veiled
attempt to call me childish,

317
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,744
at least have the courtesy
to do it to my face.

318
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:08,828
Huh?

319
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:10,663
[NAMI]
You know, when I think about it,

320
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:13,333
most of the times I've ended
up in situations like this

321
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,793
are your fault.

322
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:16,628
You're losin' it.

323
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:18,463
[SHURA]
Someone has to lose their life

324
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:22,008
to bring balance back
after your friends' escape.

325
00:18:22,092 --> 00:18:23,426
It's atonement.

326
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,845
And sacrifice is part of life.

327
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:28,348
I want them to see it
when they come back--

328
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:32,644
their good friend lying on deck,
the life drained from him.

329
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:36,856
Then they will realize the
severity of their mistakes.

330
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:40,318
And now...

331
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:42,862
...I offer your life to God!

332
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:46,366
[CHOPPER yells]
No!

333
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:51,413

[gasps, groans]

335
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,209
Now die.

It's Gan Fall the Sky Knight!

342
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:21,026

expecting company.

345

[CHOPPER] I knew you wouldn't
let me down, Sky Knight!

346
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,211
[GAN FALL] We're not dealing
with an amateur here, Pierre.

347
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:42,422
I wouldn't want to disappoint
a worthy opponent

348
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:43,882
with anything but our best.

349
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:44,966
[squawks]

350
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:49,179
What could that decrepit old
relic possibly be doing here?

351
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:51,806
Do you feel like putting
him in his place?

352
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,600
[squawks]

353
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:55,101
[GAN FALL]
Enough stalling!

354
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:58,146
[SHURA] We don't need
two Gods on this island!

355
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,776
[SHURA groans, grunts]

356
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:09,282
[CHOPPER]
Go, Sky Knight!

357
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:16,289
[SHURA growls]

358
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:18,083
[SHURA grunts]

359
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,501
[SHURA gasps]

360
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:29,386
[SHURA gasps]

361
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:30,470
[SHURA grunts]

362
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:34,474
[SHURA gasps]

363
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:40,021
[SHURA groans]

364
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:44,067
[gasps]

365
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:55,328
[CHOPPER]
Sky Knight, you're my hero!

366
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:57,747
[CHOPPER squealing]

367
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:08,967
[GAN FALL]
One more hit in the right spot

368
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,094
should do it for
him, eh, Pierre?

369
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:12,804
[PIERRE squawks]

370
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:18,893
I've had enough.

371
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,061
[CHOPPER gasps]

372
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:24,441
You're nothing but a pathetic
shell of your former self.

373
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:28,111
And I'm through playing
games with a fool.

374
00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:29,946
You showed up to this
fight a criminal,

375
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,240
which leaves me
only one option--

376
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:33,491
take you out.

377
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:35,160
[GAN FALL]
Hm?

378
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:38,204
[SHURA]
Ordeal of String!

379
00:21:38,288 --> 00:21:40,623
[FUZA screeches]

380
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:55,138
[LUFFY groaning]

381
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:57,974
[SATORI]
Aha! You're still alive!

382
00:21:58,058 --> 00:21:59,309
I'm impressed!

383
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:02,812
And as a reward
for good behavior,

384
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:04,647
we're going to finish
our little fun today

385
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:07,359
with a move I've received
several awards for.

386
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:09,027
[laughs]

387
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,030
[LUFFY groans]

388
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:14,240
[SATORI]
Ha, ha, ha!

389
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:18,536
My super secret surprise!

390
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,874
Sphere Dragon! [laughs]

391
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:38,848
<i>Even if, there are times</i>
<i>when we are far apart</i>

392
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:45,313
<i>Through it all, remember</i>
<i>I'll be there in your heart</i>

393
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,233
<i>And on days when</i>
<i>you start to cry</i>

394
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:50,985
<i>You know you'll always have</i>

395
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,864
<i>Someone who's there at your side</i>

396
00:22:54,948 --> 00:22:59,911
<i>To wipe all the tears away</i>

397
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,832
<i>We will never yield</i>

398
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,709
<i>We won't back down</i>

399
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:09,004
<i>We'll keep our dreams alive</i>

400
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>They'll never change</i>
<i>the way we feel inside</i>

401
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:18,972
<i>And the light that</i>
<i>shines eternally</i>

402
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:22,392
<i>So many tried to grasp</i>

403
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:30,275
<i>Will someday be held</i>
<i>within our hands at last</i>

404
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:44,289
[CHOPPER]
Now that's an incredible fight!

405
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:45,415
[GAN FALL]
You scum!

406
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:46,624
What did you do to me?

407
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:47,667
I can't move!

408
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,252
[CHOPPER]
Sky Knight Gan Fall!

409
00:23:49,336 --> 00:23:51,004
[LUFFY]
That doesn't look good.

410
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:52,589
[SATORI laughs]

411
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:55,592
[LUFFY laughs] Looks like
I'll get him this time.

412
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:58,970
Sanji, give this guy a good hard
pounding when you catch him.

413
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:00,597
On the next One Piece!

414
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,098
"Profound Mystery!

415
00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:04,684
Ordeal of String and
Ordeal of Love?!"

416
00:24:04,768 --> 00:24:07,270
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
