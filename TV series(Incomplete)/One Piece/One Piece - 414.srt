1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,741
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:41,377
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,681
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:47,617
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,451
Monkey D. Luffy,

42
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:50,386
a boy whose
body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,988
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:54,924
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,794
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

46
00:02:57,827 --> 00:02:59,462
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:00,964
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:04,300
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:07,904
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,307
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:14,377
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,915
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

53
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:26,022
[NARRATOR] Luffy was sent flying
from the Sabaody Archipelago

54
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:28,091
by Bartholomew Kuma.

55
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,993
After soaring through
the sky for hours,

56
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:33,463
he found himself in a kingdom
inhabited entirely by women,

57
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:34,931
Amazon Lily.

58
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:39,369
Condemned as a trespasser,
Luffy is thrown into an arena

59
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:40,970
and forced to
battle to the death

60
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:43,907
with the sisters
of the Snake Princess.

61
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,743
[AMAZONS cheering]

62
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:48,077
[AMAZON 413A]
I've never seen Marigold's

63
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:49,879
"Salamander" move before!

64
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:52,015
I can't wait!

65
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:54,384
[AMAZON 413B] Ooh!
Don't forget about Sandersonia's

66
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,019
"Eight-Headed Serpent!"

67
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:01,090
[LUFFY] There.
You're not cracked, are you?

68
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,863
Good. Just wait here, okay?

69
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:09,866
[LUFFY] Real sorry you got
turned into stone 'cause of me.

70
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:12,936
[LUFFY] All done.

71
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:16,806
Okay. Which one of you
wants your ass kicked first?

72
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,508
What a joke!

73
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:23,079
[MARIGOLD and
SANDERSONIA laughing]

74
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:25,581
Did he just say
what I think he said?

75
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:28,484
If he thinks he can win,
he's in for an ugly surprise!

76
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,585
Hilarious!

77
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:31,521
Let's find more men
to feed to the Gorgon Sisters,

78
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:33,589
because this is too funny!

79
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:35,692
Marigold! And Sandersonia!

80
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:36,926
Execute him, now.

81
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,128
For the crime of
sneaking onto our island,

82
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:41,464
and for personally offending me,

83
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:44,033
bestow on him the
ultimate punishment!

84
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,871
[MARIGOLD] Careful now!

85
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:52,742
Crap!

86
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,380
Poison, huh? That was close!

87
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:01,084
[LUFFY] Gum-Gum...

88
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:02,685
...Stamp!

89
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:11,060
[LUFFY coughing]

90
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:12,161
That hurt me.

91
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:14,697
But how? I'm made of rubber!

92
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,901
--[LUFFY] Gum-Gum Gatling!
--[SANDERSONIA] Snake Dance!

93
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:21,571
How is she doing that?

94
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:23,473
I can't get a punch in on her!

95
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:24,907
[MARIGOLD] Snake Stick!

96
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:27,577
Dammit!

97
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:33,916
[LUFFY]
What the hell are you doing?

98
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,651
You leave her alone!

99
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:37,653
Hey!

100
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:40,690
Stop! You're gonna
end up breaking her!

101
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:41,891
Good idea.

102
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,660
No! Stop!

103
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:50,733
I said stop! That's enough!

104
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,622
[AMAZON 413R] Ahh!
The warriors are fainting!

105
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:13,756
Unreal!

106
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,525
That was the Conqueror's Spirit.

107
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:16,759
You're kidding!

108
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,796
Only one out of a million people
can summon forth that Haki,

109
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:22,098
let alone control it!

110
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,901
[SANDERSONIA] I've never seen
anyone besides our big sister

111
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:27,003
do something like that!

112
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:29,639
[MARIGOLD] This boy has
the "Qualities of a Conqueror".

113
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:32,708
The ability to
stand above all others!

114
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:33,976
The same as me.

115
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,945
There's no doubt about it.

116
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,847
He wields such power.

117
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,016
But who the hell is this boy?

118
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:41,851
Is he toying with us?

119
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:44,153
All right. I get it now.

120
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:47,056
You two girls are really strong.

121
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,526
Back to the duel. Round two.

122
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:55,765
[LUFFY]
All-Out Special Power Battle!

123
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:58,000
Gum-Gum vs. Snake-Snake.

124
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,859
What are you hesitating for?

125
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:25,795
Men are unworthy
of our fear, sisters!

126
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:28,931
[AMAZON 414A]
Sonia! Mari! You can do it!

127
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:32,635
[AMAZON 414B] Yeah!
Teach that ape a lesson!

128
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:36,272
Hah! Rather silly
to be so startled. Right?

129
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:37,173
Indeed.

130
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,175
If he can't control
that Haki of his,

131
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,110
then we have nothing to fear.

132
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:46,315
Okay. Now...

133
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:47,884
If we're gonna go all out,

134
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:50,086
we better move
her outta the way.

135
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,188
I wouldn't want her to break.

136
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,757
Well look at you
making your little demands.

137
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,592
It seems you still
don't understand

138
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,127
the position you're in.

139
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:01,364
Perhaps smashing that
statue will shut you up!

140
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,166
No! Don't do it!

141
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,372
[SANDERSONIA] You should
be fighting for your life!

142
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,707
Why are protecting that statue?

143
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,742
[LUFFY coughs]

144
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:16,145
[LUFFY]
Because this was my fault.

145
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:19,115
And this is our fight.
She has nothing to do with it!

146
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,718
[HANCOCK] Very well.

147
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,087
Allow the man
to move the statue.

148
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,022
But why?

149
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,857
[HANCOCK]
I'd rather he stop his moaning

150
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,326
and show us what
he's truly capable of.

151
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,160
That way,

152
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:33,362
when we grind
him under our heels,

153
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:35,865
not only will he die
a miserable laughingstock,

154
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:39,769
he'll finally understand
how weak and useless men are.

155
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:41,070
--All right.
--All right.

156
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:58,788
Not that you're going anywhere,
but hold on a little longer.

157
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,423
I'll figure something out
after I beat up

158
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,416
these big snake ladies.

159
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,143
'Kay. Now let's do this.

160
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,146
My! Where does that
confidence come from?

161
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,080
I don't know,

162
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:18,849
but I shall enjoy
beating it out of him.

163
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:21,018
You go ahead and try.

164
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:23,688
As long as you two stop
yakking, it'll be worth it.

165
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:25,790
[SANDERSONIA]
Insolent as ever, I see.

166
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:27,992
But you shall have your wish!

167
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,466
Owww! Damn it!

168
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:41,539
As long as I can dodge,

169
00:09:41,572 --> 00:09:44,809
I don't care if you
spit that crap all day!

170
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:46,944
Now, Gum-Gum...

171
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:49,614
Bleh! What's up with this smoke?

172
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:51,048
Bleh!

173
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:52,883
[MARIGOLD] I don't
even have to hit you...

174
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:55,119
My poison can take many forms.

175
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:56,754
All deadly.

176
00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:00,558
Marigold's poison gas attack
is my favorite!

177
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:03,527
Maybe now he'll stop
jumping around so much!

178
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,229
This stuff isn't so bad.

179
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:11,535
Oh man.
I'm feeling kinda woozy.

180
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,004
[MARIGOLD] You are my prey.

181
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:14,772
I'm done toying with you.

182
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:17,508
I'm killing you,
slowly but surely.

183
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:22,013
I'll weaken you with poison,
corner you, and then finally...

184
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:23,247
...finish you.

185
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:31,288
[LUFFY groaning]

186
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:32,823
You may have been speedy before,

187
00:10:32,857 --> 00:10:35,026
but all it takes is
one whiff of my poison

188
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:36,861
to dull your senses.

189
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:40,031
[chuckling menacingly]

190
00:10:41,032 --> 00:10:43,267
[AMAZONS cheering]

191
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:49,106
Damn it. That's enough!

192
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,976
Now Gum-Gum Pistol!

193
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:55,046
And another one! Pistol!

194
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,213
You're a mess!

195
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:58,616
Perhaps you'd like to lie down?

196
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,055
[SANDERSONIA]
I laugh, but at this point,

197
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:05,923
it's more of a tragedy.

198
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,825
[MARIGOLD] No matter
how strong they may be,

199
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:11,562
I can reduce any man
to a whimpering weakling.

200
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:14,165
It's time to die!

201
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:30,214
The fight's over!

202
00:11:30,247 --> 00:11:32,149
Those blades'll
finish him for good!

203
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:39,990
I'm not dizzy now!

204
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:42,793
What d'you know?
The poison's all gone!

205
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,933
Eww! Is that his hand?

206
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:56,040
[LUFFY laughing, yelling]

207
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:57,141
Look, he's down there!

208
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,642
Persistent, isn't he?

209
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,747
Mari! Sonia!
He's still alive! Be careful!

210
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:06,383
That poison smoke's
a pain in the ass.

211
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,352
I gotta come up with a plan.

212
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:09,587
Hm?

213
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:23,100
All right, Gum-Gum...

214
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:27,805
[LUFFY]
...Balloon!

215
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:30,908
And fly away!

216
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:44,255
[AMAZONS screaming]

217
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:54,265
[LUFFY] Whew!
Yeah, that's much better.

218
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:55,933
All that poison
and smoke stuff

219
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:58,836
was really getting on my nerves.

220
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:01,772
Now I can beat you guys up
like I was supposed to.

221
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:08,312
[AMAZON 414F]
He turned into a balloon

222
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:11,182
and blew that poison
away like it was nothing!

223
00:13:11,215 --> 00:13:12,883
[AMAZON 414G]
Can all men do that?

224
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:16,453
This is highly educational!

225
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:17,788
Is it, though?

226
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:25,129
So you're going to
beat us up now, you said?

227
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:28,465
With as badly as
you've been losing,

228
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:30,734
I admit, I have my doubts.

229
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,738
[LUFFY] Just watch.

230
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:43,080
[LUFFY] Okay.

231
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,684
I'll show you what
I can do when I go all-out.

232
00:13:48,352 --> 00:13:50,454
Now Second Gear!

233
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,490
[AMAZON 414H]
What's he doing now?

234
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:56,327
[AMAZON 414I]
Is it me or is he steaming?

235
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,196
[AMAZON 414J] Men are
kind of scary, aren't they?

236
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,899
[AMAZON 414K] They're nothing
like us, that's for sure!

237
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,069
He's smoking!

238
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:06,804
This is incredible!

239
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:08,005
"All out"?

240
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:11,075
Do you mean to imply that
you've been going easy on us?

241
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:13,844
He's blowing smoke
figuratively and literally.

242
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:15,479
Think nothing of it, sister.

243
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:17,414
Perhaps we've beaten
the sense out of you

244
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:18,249
and you've forgotten,

245
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:19,950
but even if
you're hot and steamy,

246
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,486
we can still
read your every move.

247
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,756
[LUFFY] We'll see, won't we?

248
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,460
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

249
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,494
...Jet...

250
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:32,897
[SANDERSONIA] It's no use!

251
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:35,900
...Pistol!

252
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:42,239
You're not hurt, are you?

253
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:45,209
Whatever powers you possess,

254
00:14:45,242 --> 00:14:48,112
I assure you that
ours are greater still.

255
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:52,983
In other words, boy,

256
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,353
all your little trick
has done is awaken our wrath.

257
00:14:57,888 --> 00:15:00,357
[SANDERSONIA] Medusa Hair...

258
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:03,652
...Eight-Headed Serpent!

259
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,132
[AMAZON 414A] Go! Kill him!

260
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:27,568
[AMAZON 414B]
We love you, Sandersonia!

261
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:34,742
[AMAZON 414E]
She bit through the fence!

262
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:35,476
[AMAZON 414C]
Even though the snakes

263
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:37,111
are just made
out of her hair,

264
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,413
those fangs hit as hard as iron!

265
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:48,489
[SANDERSONIA]
Why can't I hit him?

266
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:49,323
I know what he's going to do,

267
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:51,659
but somehow I
still can't keep up!

268
00:15:58,632 --> 00:16:02,736
[LUFFY yelling]

269
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,736
[MARIGOLD]
Sonia. Are you all right?

270
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,341
[LUFFY] Now, Gum-Gum...

271
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:42,643
Don't bother.

272
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:43,877
As you've clearly seen before,

273
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:46,480
your attacks simply
bounce off of me.

274
00:16:49,316 --> 00:16:51,518
[MARIGOLD] As long as
I can match your speed,

275
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,821
you may strike
as hard as you like,

276
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:57,157
because my
defenses shall not fail.

277
00:16:57,191 --> 00:16:59,893
[AMAZONS gasping]

278
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,930
Let's find out.

279
00:17:02,963 --> 00:17:05,733
Jet... Bazooka!

280
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:20,514
[AMAZONS gasping]

281
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,825
[HANCOCK] Sonia! Mari!

282
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:36,397
[HANCOCK] If I recall, you
were supposed to kill the man,

283
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,632
not indulge in
his foolish games.

284
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:41,268
But... But sister...

285
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:45,439
[HANCOCK] His transgressions
are, in a word, unforgivable.

286
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:48,342
I refuse to
tolerate him any longer.

287
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,311
Yes. Of course,
we're very sorry, sister.

288
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:53,213
We'll finish him immediately.

289
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:02,189
Medusa Hair...

290
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,692
...Eight-Headed Serpent!

291
00:18:09,263 --> 00:18:11,832
Whoa! She's on fire!

292
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:14,301
Medusa Hair...

293
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:15,736
...Salamander!

294
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,973
There's nowhere
left to run, man.

295
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:20,808
[AMAZON 414I]
If he doesn't get bitten,

296
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:22,910
he's going to
get burned for sure!

297
00:18:22,943 --> 00:18:25,212
[AMAZON 414K] Ooh,
this is my favorite attack!

298
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:33,754
Now Gum-Gum...

299
00:18:39,726 --> 00:18:41,528
[LUFFY]
...Jet...

00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:44,698
...Gatling!

[AMAZONS screaming]

00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:04,051
[yelling in pain]

303
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:06,286
No, Sonia! I didn't mean to!

304
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,721
Hurry, get away from me!

305
00:19:07,754 --> 00:19:10,390
[yelling in pain]

306
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:13,393
Something is
dragging me closer! Ah!

307
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:15,295
Our tails! How did he...?

308
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,631
[SANDERSONIA]
I'm burning! I'm burning!

309
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:20,000
[MARIGOLD] Sonia, stop!
You're pulling me!

310
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:23,604
[SANDERSONIA yelling in pain]

311
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:25,606
Watch out, Sonia! Don't fall!

312
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:27,508
That's the pit of blades!

313
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,343
Hold on to the stands!

314
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:40,554
Whoa! That was close.

315
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:42,956
[AMAZON 414H]
Sandersonia... No...

316
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,660
This is absolutely pathetic.

317
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:57,571
Her back is exposed... Sonia!

318
00:19:57,604 --> 00:20:00,340
You can't let
our people see that.

319
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,710
[LUFFY] Hot!

320
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,712
[HANCOCK] He can't be...

321
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,681
[AMAZON 414J] He's going to
knock her down and skewer her!

322
00:20:07,714 --> 00:20:09,516
[AMAZON 414D] Isn't
winning enough, you animal?

323
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,752
Do you have to kick
her while she's down, too?

324
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:12,686
--Are you here to mock me?

325
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,054
--Don't move!
--Are you here to mock me?

326
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,626
Even if you guys
want to kill me,

327
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,929
that doesn't mean
that I wanna kill you.

328
00:20:23,163 --> 00:20:25,599
Why, of all
the insolent--Mari!

329
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:27,601
This is your chance
to finish him off!

330
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:30,571
Don't just stand there! Hurry!

331
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,707
I can't.
Don't you understand?

332
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,776
He isn't
mocking you, sister.

333
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:39,546
That man is... protecting us.

334
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:42,049
[AMAZON 414K] Oh no!

335
00:20:42,082 --> 00:20:44,585
Sandersonia's clothing
burned off in the fire!

336
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,886
Her back is showing!

337
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:46,954
[AMAZON 414L]
If he gets off her,

338
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:49,089
her Gorgon Eyes will be exposed!

339
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:49,957
[AMAZON 414M] Hurry! Look away!

340
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,393
She's going to
turn us all to stone!

341
00:20:53,427 --> 00:20:55,395
I didn't even realize...

342
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:57,898
It's like your sister
said before, right?

343
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,003
My secret is out.
He saw my back.

344
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:08,875
Then we mustn't let
him leave the castle alive.

345
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:10,143
Why not?
What's the big deal?

346
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:11,812
I just saw her back.

347
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:14,481
What you saw is a secret
we would die to protect.

348
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:16,583
Or rather, one that
we would kill to protect,

349
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:18,752
in this particular instance.

350
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:19,820
You'd rather die

351
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:22,689
than let people see this
thing on your back, right?

352
00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:26,727
Like I said, don't move.

353
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,002
This match is hereby over!

354
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:38,138
Everyone, you must
leave the arena at once!

355
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,540
Do not gaze
upon the Gorgon Eyes!

356
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:41,608
[AMAZON 414B] Don't look at her!

357
00:21:41,642 --> 00:21:42,743
You'll be turned to stone!

358
00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:44,011
[AMAZON 414E]
Hurry! Get out of here!

359
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:46,113
[AMAZON 414A]
Run away! Run away!

360
00:21:46,146 --> 00:21:48,181
[AMAZON 414F]
It's the Gorgon's curse!

361
00:21:48,215 --> 00:22:00,694
[AMAZONS panicking]

362
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:25,085
You know that I
was trying to kill you

363
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:26,687
just a moment ago.

364
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,855
Why are you protecting me?

365
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,057
'Cause that mark on your back

366
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,925
has nothing to do
with our fight.

367
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:34,027
We can always
settle things later.

368
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:38,732
You owe your lives
to the man you tried to execute.

369
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:42,536
You must make a decision,
but what will it be?

370
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,005
You may be able
to fool this country.

371
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:46,006
But the time may come

372
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,711
when you can nyo longer
fool yourself, Princess.

373
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,747
If you truly want to
move forward in this world,

374
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,784
you must come to terms
with what you wear on your back.

375
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:07,194
[quiet sobbing]

376
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,070
[NARRATOR] After Luffy protects
the secret of the Snake Sisters,

377
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,106
they decide to spare his life.

378
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:20,674
Hancock reveals the story

379
00:23:20,707 --> 00:23:22,776
behind the familiar mark
on their backs.

380
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:24,878
Her tale of her
childhood is one of tragedy

381
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:26,847
suffered at the hands
of a corrupt group

382
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,182
that Luffy knows all too well.

383
00:23:29,216 --> 00:23:30,917
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

384
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,219
Hancock's Confession!

385
00:23:32,252 --> 00:23:34,588
The Sisters' Abhorrent Past!

386
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,890
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
