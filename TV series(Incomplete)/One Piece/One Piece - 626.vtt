It's on!

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:49.341
[LUFFY, DUGONG A grunting]

00:12:02.188 --> 00:12:04.824
[LUFFY laughs]
I gotcha!

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:07.226
[DUGONG A grunts]

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:11.464
[LUFFY]
Whoo! I gotcha!

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:12.932
[DUGONG A grunts]

00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:18.370
[gasps]

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:20.906
[LUFFY]
Hm...? Uh!

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.210
Whoa, what's he
freaking out over?

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.345
What is he saying?

00:12:26.378 --> 00:12:29.348
He says, "It's been such
a long time, Master".

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:33.285
Oh that's right,
I recognize this guy!

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:37.056
He trained under
Luffy in Alabasta!

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:39.625
The Kung Fu Dugong!

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:02.915
I demand an explanation
for this nonsense!

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:07.019
How dare you imprison the genius
scientist Caesar Clown?

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:11.223
Isn't anybody listening to me?
Release me now, or else!

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:13.592
[BREED laughs]

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:14.693
Huh?

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:16.629
[BREED]
Hello, Caesar.

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:20.666
I trust all is well with you?

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:24.336
[gasps] Oh, a familiar face
at last, thank goodness!

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.405
Now then, would you
mind setting me free?

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:28.541
I need to see Doflamingo.

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:32.077
That's enough whining,
worthless human scum!

00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:34.814
[CAESAR CLOWN gasps]

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:36.515
Wh-What are you doing?

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:39.552
Does this mean... that you
aren't working for Doflamingo?

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:41.053
Don't toy with me!

00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:43.055
I am the great Caesar Clown!

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:45.257
Heh, I know who you are.

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:47.726
Joker's little
pet scientist, correct?

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.994
You know Joker?

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:51.630
Then you must be connected to
the underground network as well!

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:52.798
[BREED laughs]

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.801
Just be a good pet and wag
your tail for master Breed!

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.337
I intend to create the
kingdom of my dreams,

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.240
and I need your intellect
to make it a reality!

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:04.810
Kingdom? I am the greatest mind
this world has ever seen,

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.746
and you are a despotic
blowhard I only just met!

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.849
So why should I obey
the likes of you?

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:12.885
[laughs] Well, I do hope you
enjoyed your final moments

00:14:12.918 --> 00:14:14.820
of independence, Caesar.

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:21.460
Wh-What are you doing?
Stop it! Stay away from me!

00:14:21.493 --> 00:14:23.028
[yells]

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:25.397
Hey! I remember you!

00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:28.367
Yeah, you're the Kung Fu Seal
I met back in Alabasta!

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.703
[DUGONG A babbles]

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:33.672
"It's good to see you, Master!"

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:34.573
How cool!

00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:36.375
I can't believe we
ran into you again!

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:37.810
How've you been, buddy?

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:40.512
You two are already catching up?

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:41.947
What's this all about?

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:44.149
Well, see, this Kung Fu
Dugong happens to be

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:45.985
the same one Luffy
met a long time ago

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:48.287
in a kingdom called Alabasta.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.022
[DUGONG A]
Ha, ha!

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:51.757
[CHOPPER]
Kung Fu Dugongs love fighting,

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.327
and they're quick to
challenge anyone to a duel.

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:56.428
But...

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:58.998
[LUFFY]
Whoo! I gotcha!

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:00.733
[CHOPPER]
Luffy beat him.

00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:02.735
When a Kung Fu Dugong
loses a fight,

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:05.004
he becomes disciple
to the winner.

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:06.238
[DUGONG A whimpers]

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:08.874
And that's pretty much it.

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:12.344
[LAW] That makes sense.
But what are they up to now?

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:13.345
Huh?

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:15.114
Here we go! Follow my lead.

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:18.617
Right fist! Left fist! One! Two!

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:21.687
Pull your arm all the
way back and go!

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:26.292
And make sure you put
your whole body into it!

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:27.893
Even more power than that!

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.562
Now one! Two! One! Two!

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:34.033
[CHOPPER] Wow, they're like
two peas in a pod.

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.502
[LUFFY] You really are the
seal I met a long time ago!

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:38.537
You're way stronger
than you used to be!

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.206
[DUGONG A babbles]

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.942
Huh? What's going on there?

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:43.876
[CHOPPER]
Hm?

[DUGONG A babbles]

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:47.146
[CHOPPER] He says he saw
the scar on your chest

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:49.415
in the newspaper and copied it!

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:51.150
Whoa. Did you fight Akainu too?

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:52.418
[DUGONG A babbles]

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:54.153
He painted it on!

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:57.990
[LUFFY laughs]
That's so weird!

00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:00.192
[LAW] Look, this is a
heartwarming reunion and all,

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:02.628
but what I want to know is what
are you doing in the New World,

00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:06.498
and more importantly, why did
you kidnap our hostage?

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:09.301
[gasps, babbles]

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:12.338
He says, "I'm really sorry that
I attacked your ship, Master!

00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:14.006
I didn't even know it was yours.

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:16.308
I do have a good
reason for it, though.

The truth is..."

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:22.715
[CHOPPER] "You said something
during my training."

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:25.384
[LUFFY] When you're a pirate,
you're always free!

00:16:25.417 --> 00:16:28.854
There's more fun out there at
sea than you can imagine!

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:34.760
so I decided to set out
to sea on my own!

I wanted to become a free
pirate just like you, Master!"

lots of friends too!"

[CHOPPER' "We formed a pirate
band of sea creatures

adventures together!

Then we eventually made
it to the New World!

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:58.450
But not long after that,

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:02.021
was when we met that
terrible pirate Breed!"

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:03.122
[BREED]
Oh?

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:06.091
A pirate group comprised
entirely of sea monsters?

00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:07.559
How interesting!

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:11.463
I think I'd like all of you
to be part of my crew!

[CHOPPER] "We've been working
as his slaves ever since.

That's why we kidnapped Caesar.

Breed ordered us to do it
and we couldn't refuse!"

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:23.675
I get it. Breed is
the mastermind.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.644
It turns out Doflamingo
had nothing to do

00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:27.146
with what happened after all.

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:28.714
I'm still confused though.

00:17:28.747 --> 00:17:30.883
You're pretty tough, why don't
you just kick his butt

00:17:30.916 --> 00:17:32.785
and tell him to stop
messing with you?

My goodness, would you
take a look at that?

[ANIMALS gasp]

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:11.590
You should be ashamed.

00:18:11.623 --> 00:18:13.859
You've all disappointed
me terribly.

00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:17.963
You know, a pet is loyal to
its master, but it's also loyal,

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:20.466
not to mention loyal,
and above all loyal.

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:22.501
Am I being clear?

00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:24.770
And loyalty means,
when I say fall in,

00:18:24.803 --> 00:18:28.540
you have three seconds
to execute my command!

to be responsible for

uniting this pack
of unruly strays!

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.614
If you let your master
down again,

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:39.751
you're a failure as a pet!
That's no better than a human!

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:42.988
We don't have time for this.
Give Caesar back to us.

00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:45.958
What? I'll do no such thing!

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:49.895
Huh? Ah, I see.
It's you mongrels.

[BREED chuckles]
Yes, it is I, Breed!

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:55.601
I'm a pirate.

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:57.169
A pirate?

00:18:57.202 --> 00:19:01.106
[BREED laughs] Who would have
guessed the infamous Warlord

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.176
Trafalgar Law would show
up with Straw Hat Luffy,

00:19:04.209 --> 00:19:06.745
the pirate worth 400 million?

00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:09.381
I must say I appreciate you
chasing us all the way here,

You think you can beat us
with your stupid goop hand?

[BREED laughs] I've really
got to hand it to you!

The two of you are quite strong.
Stronger than me for certain.

00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:52.291
That said,

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:55.627

this battle as you'll soon see!

[CHOPPER]
Huh? Me?

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:03.902
You will attack Trafalgar
Law and Straw Hat.

Rip them to shreds, now!

Hey, what the heck's going on?

00:20:10.108 --> 00:20:11.610
You're acting a little weird.

[CHOPPER growls]

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:33.031

That is an impressive trick!

00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:39.304
[LUFFY]
Watch it, you almost hit us!

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:40.973
Why don't you fight him?

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:43.242
That bastard!

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:45.277
[BREED laughs]

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:50.315
[CHOPPER yells]

00:20:50.949 --> 00:20:53.352
You guys have to
get away from me!

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:55.454
[LUFFY grunts]
What's wrong with him?

00:20:55.487 --> 00:20:57.189
He knows what he's doing but...

00:20:57.222 --> 00:20:58.590
It looks like this collar thing

00:20:58.624 --> 00:21:00.392
is giving him
control of my body!

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:03.729
Just hurry up and run away
before he makes me smash you!

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:08.133
I'll have to use Room. Sorry.

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:09.635
[LUFFY] No, don't!
You're gonna hurt him!

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:11.370
I'm not gonna
kill him, you idiot!

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:13.805
I have to get control
of him somehow!

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:14.573
[LAW, LUFFY gasp]

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:16.675
[LAW shouts]
He got me!

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:18.277
[BREED laughs]

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.311
[LAW growls]

00:21:19.344 --> 00:21:21.613
[BREED continues laughing]

00:21:21.647 --> 00:21:22.681
I already told you,

00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:25.784
I'm gifted with the power
of the Pet-Pet Fruit!

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:28.020
Wait a minute. Pet-Pet?

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:30.922
Bingo! It gives me the
ability to manipulate

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:33.825
any living thing simply by
fitting it with one of these

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:35.794
wonderful glowing
collars of mine!

00:21:35.827 --> 00:21:40.399
[laughs] Well, I hope you
enjoy being my pets!

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:43.935
Your pets? You can't force me
to listen to you, you weirdo!

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:47.406
Oh, but I can, and you're about
to discover that for yourself!

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:50.375
With those collars, I'll be able
to harness all of your powers

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:51.977
to their fullest extent!

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.846
From now on, you pathetic
creatures are going to obey

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.616
your new master's
every single command!

00:21:57.649 --> 00:22:02.654
[BREED laughs]

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:19.304
[NARRATOR] The sinister
Breed uses the powers of his

00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:21.640
Pet-Pet fruit to capture
Luffy and Law.

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:24.643
Although both try fighting back,
they're unable to break free of

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:27.312
the captain's clever trap and
are forced to fight one another

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:28.180
to the death.

00:22:28.213 --> 00:22:29.648
With seemingly no way out,

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:32.417
their battle suddenly reaches
an unexpected conclusion!

00:22:32.451 --> 00:22:33.952
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:35.454
"Luffy Dies at Sea?!

00:22:35.487 --> 00:22:37.656
The Pirate Alliance
Comes Apart!"

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:40.492
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
