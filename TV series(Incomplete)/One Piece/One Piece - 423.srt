1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,616
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,244
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,080
in search of the One Piece,
the legendary treasure

40
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,375
left behind by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,211
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,130
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,841
sets sail to become the next
King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,677
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,387
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,472
of the World Government,
which will use

47
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,267
any means necessary
to stop them.

48
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,687
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

49
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:11,149
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

50
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,277
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue.

51
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,238
The crew will cut a path
across the Grand Line

52
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,740
to the New World!

53
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,746
[NARRATOR] In an attempt
to rescue his brother Ace,

54
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,915
Luffy enlisted the aid
of the Pirate Empress,

55
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,667
Boa Hancock to sneak
onto a Navy Vessel

56
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,836
bound for Impel Down.

57
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,256
[GARP] I'm sure you heard about
what your brother's been up to.

58
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,800
Now, I don't expect us
to get along perfect,

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,261
but challenging the
World Government head-on

60
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,723
and wrecking up Enies Lobby
is over the line,

61
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,767
Oh, by the way.

62
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:49,270
I told the little punk
about his father.

63
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,441
[GARP] 'Course, the news
took him by surprise.

64
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,944
Can't blame the boy.

65
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,530
[ACE] "Our fathers?"
To hell with them.

66
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,825
And to hell with you if you ever
thought we could be Marines.

67
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,661
We've both got the
blood of criminals

68
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,537
flowing through our veins

69
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,583
and that was only gift those
bastards ever gave us.

70
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,877
I took the name
"Portgas" from my mother

71
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,296
because I owe her so much.

72
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,675
But I don't owe my
"father" a damned thing.

73
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,969
I don't even
remember the bastard.

74
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,846
Heh. He can keep his name.

75
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,392
[GARP] I know, I know, but
the man tried. He wanted to--

76
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,352
[ACE]
Enough, all right?

77
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,438
Listen to me.

78
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,693
Don't fight it.
Run wild with us.

79
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,362
Our flag will be yours.

80
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,240
[WHITEBEARD]
And I will call you my son.

81
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,534
[ACE]
Whitebeard is my only father.

82
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,247
Got it, old man?

83
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,877
Better for us to quit
while we're still ahead.

84
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,713
Buggy the Clown had a good run,

85
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,257
but I'm afraid his luck
as a pirate has run out.

86
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,384
[MOHJI]
No! I refuse to accept it!

87
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,677
He's a man among men.

88
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,723
The only way Captain Buggy can
go out is in a blaze of glory!

89
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,933
All right. Impel Down.

90
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,518
This is it.

91
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,983
[HANNYABAL] Welcome to
my prison, Impel Down.

92
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,901
Oops, jumped the gun there.

93
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,863
It's not, well,
exactly mine just yet.

94
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:25,575
I'm the Vice Warden Hannyabal--
well, for now at least.

95
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,578
A pleasure to meet you,
Vice Admiral.

96
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,913
Oh. And don't forget these.

97
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,624
[DOMINO] Keep in mind that
they're sea prism stone.

98
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,585
You call me a "visitor" here.

99
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,963
Not a prisoner.
Then you put me in those?

100
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,262
[NARRATOR]
Countdown to Ace's Execution.

101
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,390
33 Hours.

102
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,937
[LUFFY]
A Reunion in Hell?

103
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,607
The Man Who Ate
the Chop-Chop Fruit!

104
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:09,619
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL buzzing]

105
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,412
You'd leave me powerless?

106
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,789
How cruel.

107
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,418
But necessary.

108
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,811
[SURVEILLANCE GUYS moaning]

109
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:48,741
[HANCOCK giggles]
Be gentle-- I'm delicate.

110
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,909
[DOMINO gasps]

111
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,995
[SURVEILLANCE GUY 422A gasps]

112
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,372
What happened?

113
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,754
[HANCOCK]
It's safe now, Luffy.

114
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,591
[LUFFY grunts]
Wow. That was close!

115
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,635
I was startin' to think
I'd just have to crawl

116
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,054
out from there like a cockroach
and hope for the best.

117
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,057
That power of yours really
is handy in a pinch, huh?

118
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,643
Even so. I'm afraid
that this is as far

119
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,645
as I'll be able
to accompany you.

120
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,021
They're quite insistent
on placing me

121
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,149
in those Sea Prism
Stone Handcuffs.

122
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,027
And once they take my cloak,
you'll have nowhere to hide.

123
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:25,945
I just wish...

124
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,114
I wish I could do more
to help you, but--

125
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,657
Aw, don't talk like that.

126
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,534
You got me in this
place, didn't you?

127
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,453
That's more than
I coulda done alone.

128
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,163
Even though there's
guards everywhere,

129
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,956
we made it all this
way no problem.

130
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,791
I can handle the rest.

131
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,835
[HANCOCK sighs]
Luffy...

132
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,546
Huh?

133
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,756
Breaking your brother out
will be challenging enough,

134
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,717
but if you get captured as well,

135
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,844
who knows what horrors
you might face.

136
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:55,766
One wrong step and you may never
see the light of day again.

137
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,103
I know you want to save Ace,
but this is dangerous.

138
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,898
Please, take care
of yourself, too.

139
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,858
[HANCOCK gasps]

140
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,943
I won't let you down,
you have my word.

141
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,447
Thanks for everything,
Hancock, you're the best.

142
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,865
I won't forget what you've done.

143
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,493
Not for the rest of my life!

144
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,995
[HANCOCK]
He just called me by my name.

145
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,789
My real, actual name.

146
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,626
For the first time!

147
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,086
[LUFFY] Cool! Whatever
works for you, Hammock!

148
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,422
Can I get seconds
over here, Hammock?

149
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,132
Hey, Hammock.
What're you doin'?

150
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,763
Hey, Hancock.

151
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:42,563
[HANCOCK giggling, sighing]

152
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,692
My life is finally complete.
I can die happy!

153
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,988
Hey. You can turn
that lady back now.

154
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,157
I should be fine up here.

155
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,536
Say it, Luffy.
Say my name again.

156
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,745
Uh, what?

157
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,959
[MOMONGA]
This is taking too long.

158
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,961
[HANNYABAL]
This situation is unprecedented,

159
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,338
she's probably just
being thorough.

160
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,133
Heh. A thorough body search.

161
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:11,968
[MOMONGA]
Hm?

162
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,305
[HANNYABAL gasps]
That's so naughty!

163
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,350
Get your mind out
of the gutter, damn it!

164
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,727
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL]
Beep! Beep!

165
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,187
[SURVEILLANCE GUY 422A]
Vice Warden Hannyabal!

166
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,648
We're not getting any visuals
from the surveilance snail

167
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,732
in the examination room.

168
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,818
Is something going on in
there we don't know about?

169
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,820
Huh?

170
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,282
[HANNYABAL] Domino.
Something wrong in there?

171
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,659
No answer, huh?

172
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,036
It's okay. I am the
Vice Warden, right?

173
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,789
Checking things out in there
is strictly business, you see.

174
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,249
Even if that business
happens to involve

175
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,793
two hot chicks
touching each other.

176
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,044
Ugh.

177
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:49,880
[HANNYABAL]
Huh?

178
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,924
[HANCOCK]
Hmph.

179
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,012
We have completed
the body search, sir.

180
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,722
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL]
Beep beep.

181
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,140
[SURVEILLANCE GUY 422A]
Scratch that last report.

182
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,266
Everything is fine here.

183
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,018
I hope I didn't cause
a problem, sir.

184
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,728
Did the exam take too long?

185
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,315
Huh? No. Everything's
fine on our end, too.

186
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,443
[HANCOCK] Hmph. I see that your
guests are treated as poorly

187
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,028
as your prisoners here.

188
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,363
Surely an empress
deserves better than this.

189
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,449
[HANNYABAL] It is a pity.
But in Impel Down,

190
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,869
we can't afford to make
exceptions to the rules.

191
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,414
[DOMINO] I wonder why I can't
shake this strange feeling.

192
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,540
[HANCOCK]
Lead the way.

193
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,209
[HANNYABAL] Ah, yes, if you'll
let me in front, please.

194
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,211
Or, just go that way.

195
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,426
Before we visit Ace,
we'll take this elevator

196
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,887
to what we call the
"Burning Heat Floor,"

197
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,389
where we'll stop by the
Warden Magellan's office.

198
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,768
Fair warning: As the name
implies, it's quite hot there.

199
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:54,487
[HANCOCK]
Luffy! Be bold, but be safe.

200
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,199
[whispering]
Bye Hancock-- Thank you.

201
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,117
[HANCOCK gasps]

202
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,243
Is something wrong?

203
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,829
[HANCOCK gasps]

204
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:13,422
[HANCOCK]
"Han... cock... I love you."

205
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,759
Oh! He really does love me!

206
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,261
[MOMONGA] Easy.
[HANNYABAL] Empress Hancock,

207
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,347
[HANNYABAL] what's wrong?
Do you need mouth-to-mouth?

208
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,556
[DOMINO]
Are you ill?

209
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,266
You were fine
just a moment ago--

210
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,518
What happened?

211
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,948
'Kay. Not sure where to
take things from here.

212
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,367
Hancock said Ace is
probably underwater.

213
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,287
Looks like that elevator
might head down a long way.

214
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,122
Oh yeah.

215
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,041
The Vivre Card
might come in handy.

216
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,130
Here we go.

217
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,103
[SEA KING 423A growls]

218
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,360
[GUARD 423A]
The Blugoris are returning.

219
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,154
[GUARD 423B] Looks like
they grabbed dinner, too.

220
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,488
Open the hatch.

221
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,618
[GUARD 423A]
Nice work.

222
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,997
[GUARD 423B] Get it to the
fridge and we'll be done.

223
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,498
[BLUGORI pants]

224
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,626
[HANCOCK grunts]

225
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,461
[MOMONGA]
Hm?

226
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,296
Hope you're feeling
better, Empress.

227
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,590
We should be passing through
level one any second now.

228
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,133
[PRISONER screams]

229
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,847
[PRISONERS screaming]

230
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,099
Lemme outta here, damn it!

231
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,351
[PRISONER 423B screams]

232
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,312
[MOMONGA]
It's even worse than I expected.

233
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,230
[DOMINO]
Surely you jest.

234
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,566
This floor hosts
relatively minor offenders

235
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,526
so these whippings are
mostly a formality.

236
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,527
Madness.

237
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,490
And yet, it's the truth.
Level one of Impel Down

238
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,992
is known as the
Crimson Floor, by the way.

239
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,410
[HANCOCK]
What's crimson about it?

240
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,662
[HANNYABAL]
That would be a secret!

241
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:12,416
Level 2 is the "Floor of
Wild Beasts from Hell."

242
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,043
Pretty straightforward.

243
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,086
As we move deeper underwater,

244
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,006
we reach Level 3,
The Starvation Floor.

245
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,092
Followed by Level 4,
the Burning Heat Floor,

246
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,303
which is our destination.

247
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,971
You can't tell from the surface,

248
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,224
but this structure is
actually quite expansive.

249
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,060
Since it takes a while for
this elevator to get to Level 4,

250
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,645
you'll have plenty
of time to indulge

251
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,396
in the cacophony of screams.

252
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,982
And is Fire Fist Ace on Level 4?

253
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,276
No and that isn't the
bottom floor, either--

254
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,111
we have a wide
selection of torturous...

[LUFFY grunts]

257
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,244
Ace should be down
these stairs, somewhere.

[RANDOM PRISONER 423B]
No fair! You cheater!

259
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,586
We thought you
were just a clown--

260
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,255
you didn't tell us
you could do that!

are you losers,

just gonna run out on us?

Huh?

267
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,017
That sounds like something
a friend would say

268
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,936
and you folks're
no friends of mine.

269
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,063
I'm a free eagle, chumps--
so deal with it!

slip out like me?
