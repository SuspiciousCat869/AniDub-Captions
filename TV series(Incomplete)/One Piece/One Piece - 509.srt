[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:40,394
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,962
in search of the One Piece,

00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,998

left behind by Gold Roger,

Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,940
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,810
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,446
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,980
of the World Government,

12
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,984
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

Now this is exciting!

kind of adventure's up next!

[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16

the Grand Line to the New World!

After losing his brother Ace

18
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:25,773
during the War of the Best,
Luffy was distraught.

19
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:29,343
Me? King of the Pirates?

20
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,878
[NARRATOR] He was soon surprised
by Dark King Rayleigh's

21
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,548
unexpected appearance
at the Maiden Island.

22
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,984
I may have another
suggestion for you.

[NARRATOR] After they learned
of Ace's death at Marineford,

24
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,422
the rest of the
Straw Hats made haste

25
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:45,659

home to the ruins
of the Muggy Kingdom.

31
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,904
An old castle remains from
the long-dead empire.

32
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,105
Despite its age,

33
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,643
a well-known figure has
made the castle his home.

34
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,946
Why did Moria have
to get himself killed?

How can you be so heartless
when I'm grieving?

Show some compassion,

anything kind to say?

[MIHAWK]
I never invited you.

45
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,640
The two of you showed up

46
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,343
and started living
here without asking.

47
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,345
Furthermore,

48
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,447
this article is not credible.

What?

50
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,150
But does that mean Moria
could still be alive?

51
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,685
He made it out?

52
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,621
A good question, now you ask.

53
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,692
If he died,
then I didn't see it.

54
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,594
Although, if he did escape,

55
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:29,362
then I didn't see
that either, I'm afraid.

56
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,931
[PERONA] But you think
he might have survived

57

about it for some reason?

down, you moron!

try and fight them again!

survived the first fight.

You told me what
happened to my captain.

He should still be alive,

to be severely traumatized.

even knew the war was happening.

[MIHAWK] It's been quite a while
since you left the castle,

175
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,797
yet you've only
made it this far. Pity.

176
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,435
And the boat I offered you.
It seems it's not seaworthy now.

177
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:43,203
Shut up! It's fine.

178
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,705
I can just hold onto
a few planks and swim there.

179
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,308
I'm not one to give up
that easily, all right?

180
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:53,380
Your sentiment is admirable,
but you can't defeat them.

181
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,982
They're called Humandrills,

182
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:58,352
baboons that develop by
imitating human behavior.

183
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,354
[ZORO]
Humandrills?

184
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,822
Had they grown up among
peace-loving humans,

185
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,126
they would've turned
out differently,

186
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,060
but not on this island.

187
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,763
[MIHAWK]
Up until seven years ago,

188
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,132
this was the site
of a great war.

189
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,302
[MIHAWK]
When I first came here to live,

190
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:18,939
the entire island still
smelled of blood and smoke.

191
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:22,542
Everywhere, dead bodies
littered the ground.

192
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,045
As the battles raged on,
these baboons watched

193
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,480
the violence between
the humans unfold.

194
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,250
In time, they learned how to
use human weapons and armor,

195
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,253
becoming warriors of the forest.

196
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,155
Humans can defeat
ordinary animals

197
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,391
by using weapons and intellect.

198
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,861
But what happens when
animals don weapons, as well?

199
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,163
As you can see, they make
formidable opponents

200
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,765
for an arrogant young man.

201
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,166
You talkin' about me?

202
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,002
Well, who else?

203
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,671
Now, let's leave. It's late.

204
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:54,508
The Humandrills won't
set foot near the castle.

205
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:57,811
Yeah? You got no right
tellin' me what to do!

206
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:01,047
I've got to make it to the sea!

207
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,349
Of course.

208
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,684
Do as you like.

209
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,021
[panting]

210
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:10,090
I don't care if they're
"forest warriors" or monkeys.

211
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,260
I've already wasted enough
time stranded in this dump!

212
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,264
I'm cutting down
every single one of 'em!

213
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,835
Come on! That doof's gotta
be around here somewhere!

214
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,102
[HUMANDRILLS shouting]

215
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:24,872
[PERONA gasps] There! But
the baboons got to him first!

216
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:28,008
[HUMANDRILLS screaming]

217
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:29,777
Zoro! No!

218
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,112
[ZORO yells]

219
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,468
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
in the land of Hungeria,

220
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,870
on Lazy Bones Island.

221
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,208
What is he doing? He's been
in that shack forever!

222
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,745
If Lord Satan's gonna help
us curse the Longarm Tribe,

223
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:06,513
then how come it's so quiet?

224
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:08,882
Lord Satan knows
what he's doing.

225
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,819
There's no doubt in my mind that
our savior is bringing forth

226
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,186
a powerful incantation

227
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,289
to deal the tyrannical
Longarm Tribe a fatal blow!

228
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:21,361
[BROOK laughs] Greetings,
everyone! Thank you for waiting!

229
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,497
[SATAN WORSHIPPER K]
Is the ritual finally over?

230
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,332
Atta boy, Satan!

231
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,636
[BROOK] My work is now complete.
I hope it will do the trick.

232
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,071
What is he holding?

233
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,806
[BROOK]
And here you go!

234
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,875
Oh. Thank you, Lord.

235
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:35,609
What is it?

236
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,044
Just a little ditty.

237
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,779
[SATANIC PRIEST]
Wait! No! Don't tell me!

238
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:40,781
Huh?

239
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,016
Our prayers have
finally been answered!

240
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,818
Satan has penned
a set of talismans

241
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,853
to help us kill
the Longarm Tribe!

242
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,224
Lord Satan has doomed the
Longarms to an agonizing death!

243
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,291
[BROOK]
Huh?

244
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,227
We're now as good as invincible.

245
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,596
Try as they might,
even those long-armed bullies

246
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,031
can't lay their hands
on us anymore!

247
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:01,135
I bet the mere sight of these
symbols will strike them dead!

248
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,436
[BROOK]
Not exactly.

249
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,336
How awesome!

250
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,738
That's Lord Satan for ya!

251
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,074
[SATANIC PRIEST] Come on,
men! Everybody grab a page

252
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:10,243
and find a place to nail it
up around town! Be quick!

00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,778
--No. It's not like that,
--[SATAN WORSHIPPERS] Right!

254
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:14,147
you really shouldn't
separate them.

255
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,788
Oh, goodness.

256
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:22,189
Hello?

[SATAN WORSHIPPERS panting]

[SATAN WORSHIPPER L]
They're all posted now!

259
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,529
Yes! Excellent work, friends!

260
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,498
I finally feel safe now!

261
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:33,199
We all owe you our lives.
Thank you, Lord!

262
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,234
[BROOK]
Uh...

263
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,236
[SATAN WORSHIPPER G]
Sir! We have a problem!

265
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,005
The Longarm Tribe
is on their way here!

[SATANIC PRIEST]
Those simpletons

267
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:42,309
are like moths to a flame.

268
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,178
Now, we sit back and watch,

269
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:48,082
for as of today,
our enemies are history!

270
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:52,386
Hold on! Um, that thing?
With all the pages?

271
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:55,555
It's actually a musical score,
not a talisman at all.

272
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:59,426
[SATAN WORSHIPPERS]
Huh? What?!

273

[LONGARMS chuckling]

274
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,800
Welp, we're dead!

275
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,671
They'll take our food. What
few things of value we have,

276
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,005
they'll claim as their own.

277
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:15,409
People will be kidnapped.
Life will be miserable.

278
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,077
We have no choice.

279
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,581
[BROOK]
You always have a choice!

280
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:22,182

00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:28,388
Please, lend me
your ears if you would.

[violin playing]

284
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,798
This song? What's it doing?

285
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:39,065
[SATAN WORSHIPPER M]
It's as if my body

286
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,068
is filling with
a brand-new energy!

00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:47,274
[LONGARM BOSS] What the hell
is this? Some kind of spell?

289
00:16:47,308 --> 00:16:48,742
[LONGARM TWINTAILS] Not only
do people with one joint

290
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,478
in their arm look funny,
but they think funny too!

291
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,146
What're they up to this time?

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,182
[LONGARMS laughing]

293
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,186
Huh? Well now, what's this?

294
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,690
From this day forth,

295
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:07,394
we no longer allow the Longarm
Tribe to terrorize our people!

Huh?

00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,063
[SATAN WORSHIPPER N]
That's right!

298
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:10,731
We're finally fighting back!

00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:11,932
[SATAN WORSHIPPER O]
Yeah! You're not taking

300

anything else from us!

00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,801

protect that which is ours

Make your move.
We're not afraid of you!

Hey, Boss, they're acting
kinda different than usual.

All right.

307

Guess we need to remind
these shortarms we own them.

You're truly
a blessing from hell!

00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,761
Thank you, Lord Satan.

[laughs]

314
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,297
[SATANIC PRIEST]
It's unreal.

315
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,865
I never imagined that one day

316
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,567
we'd be able to fight
back like that,

317
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,936
much less beat them
and put them in a cage!

318

The music--something
about it changed us.

00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:53,674
I've never felt
so uplifted before!

He's right! Courage and strength
welled up in our hearts.

321
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,612
We stood up and
defended ourselves

322
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,280
for the first time in our lives.

00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,415
[BROOK grunts]

324
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:02,683
[SATANIC PRIEST]
Of course, we had no idea

325
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,151
how to use our weapons.

326
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:07,287
Ultimately, you did most of
the actual fighting by yourself.

327
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,589
But that's okay!

328
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:11,458
What matters is the people who
were abducted came back safely!

[BROOK laughs]

330
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:17,798
No, you're too modest!
I only helped a teeny bit.

331
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:20,000
Neither gods nor
devils will help those

332
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,735
who won't fight on their own.

333
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,470
In times like these,
it is important

334
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,305
to stand resolute against evil,

335
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,340
even if the odds
seem insurmountable.

336
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:29,877
You have the courage.
You proved that today.

337
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,645
Such a wise god!

338
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,147
You've inspired us.

00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,182
We'll do our best
to make you proud!

340
00:18:35,216 --> 00:18:37,050
[SATAN WORSHIPPERS] Thank you
very much for your teachings.

repaid their kindness.

Still, I can't believe the news.

Please stay strong, Luffy.
I hope you're all right.

345

I'll be there soon
to share in your grief.

346
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:55,202
If I had a heart,
it would be heavy!

347
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:58,072
Until I can return to your side,
all I can do is play a song,

348
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:01,074
and hope that it
reaches you, somehow.

349
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,276
Damn it! Guh!

350
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,645
I can't believe they got
the devil as their bodyguard!

351
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:05,946
What an embarrassment!

352
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,881
They should be the ones
in cages with those

353
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:10,217
freakish single-jointed
arms of theirs on display!

354
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:13,053
Actually, we could make a lot of
money doing that, couldn't we?

355
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:14,822
[SATANIC PRIEST chuckles]
Good idea.

356
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:16,023
[LONGARMS]
Huh?

357
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:18,992
We'll put their freakish
double-jointed arms on display.

358
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:22,496
They owe us and we can certainly
make a lot of money doing that!

359
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,597
[BROOK]
Wait, just a minute!

360
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:24,931
--[BROOK] That's wrong!
--[SATANIC PREIST] Huh?

361
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:28,068
And it's immoral! I'm certain
that you didn't appreciate it

362
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,270
when they were cruel to you.

363
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:30,770
[SATAN WORSHIPPERS]
Huh?

364
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:32,973
[BROOK]
Everyone, listen to me!

365
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,977
Let them go?
How could we, Lord Satan?

366
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,913
They'll just come back
and attack us again!

367
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:41,515
No, they will not.
I'll make sure of that

368
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,917
by binding them
to a devil's contract.

369
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,385
[LONGARMS gasping]

370
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,854
[BROOK]
Heed my words well.

371
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:51,258
If you break your oath with me
and commit a wrongful act

372
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,927
against the people
in this country again,

373
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,463
I will hunt each of you down.

374
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:58,532
And then I will eat your heart!

375
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,701
[LONGARMS scream]

376
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:03,770
Thank you, sir!
We promise you we'll behave!

377
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:05,839
We're going straight
back to our homes!

378
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,742
We'll never come back again,
oh, please don't hurt us!

379
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,010
[LONGARMS grunt]

380
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:13,180
You three are free to go,
but you must always remember--

381
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,515
Do not treat others poorly!

382
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,251
If somebody went
into your country

383
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:21,254
causing havoc and destruction,
then I'm sure you'd be unhappy.

384
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:25,559
It doesn't matter if you have
one or two joints in your arms.

385
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,727
Deep down, we're all the same!

386
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:29,663
So, treat each
other with respect!

387
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,599
[LONGARMS]
Yes, thank you!

388
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:34,635
--[SATANIC PRIEST sniffling]
--[BROOK laughing]

389
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:35,936
[LONGARMS]
Now, grab him!

390
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,738
[BROOK]
Ah! Woah!

391
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:40,540
Wha-- Huh-- What's
the big idea here?

392
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,809
[LONGARMS]
Away we go!

393
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,612
[LONGARM BOSS] Sorry, but
we don't believe in curses!

394
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,281
[LONGARM TWINTAILS]
Also, your speech was stupid

395
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:49,015
and you fell for the
oldest trick in the book!

396
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,717
[LONGARM A chuckles]
If we bring back

397
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:53,119
an actual walking,
talking skeleton...

398
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:54,655
[LONGARM TWINTAILS] ...we can
make a whole ton of money!

399
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,890
[BROOK]
Wait a minute! Let me go!

400
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,859
I have somewhere I need to be!

401
00:20:58,892 --> 00:20:59,926
[SATANIC PRIEST]
Oh, no.

402
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:05,131
We have an emergency! Lord Satan
has just been kidnapped!

403
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:06,367
Everyone,

404
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,336
prepare to summon
another devil and fast!

405
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,137
Yes! We can still summon devils

406
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:13,473
with the magical
power of underwear!

407
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:16,243
[SATAN WORSHIPPERS cheer]

408
00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:19,913
[BROOK] Luffy, when you
feel sad, just sing a song!

409
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,183
Music is meant
to make you happy!

410
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:24,184
So sing as you wait for me!

411
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,552
I'll try to...

412
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:28,322
No, I will be there!

413
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:31,191
Till then, if you can hear me,

414
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:33,193
send help!

415
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:45,038
Well, then, that's it.

416
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:50,510
[gasps] I'm sorry.
What did you just say to him?

417
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:51,444
You heard.

418
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,713
You were right here
the whole time.

419
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:54,180
[HANCOCK]
Ugh. No!

420
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:57,617
I'm finding it difficult to
understand your intentions!

421
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,988
Surely, you know what's going
on in Luffy's mind right now.

422
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:02,989
Think of all he's been through!

423
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:04,524
Depending on your answer,

424
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:07,260
I may not be able
to forgive you!

425
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:08,695
[JIMBEI]
I agree.

426
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,931
How dare you suggest
such a thing,

427
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:13,267
and so soon after the war!

428
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,435
It's simply cruel.

429
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:18,205
I made a suggestion, that's all.

430
00:22:18,238 --> 00:22:20,273
Only Luffy can decide.

431
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:22,008
So, what's your decision?

432
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:30,718
I don't know...

433
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:32,552
All my friends...

434
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:35,289
[LUFFY]
I never want them

435
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:37,924
to go through something
like that again!

436
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:43,497
[LUFFY]
If I do like you tell me to,

437
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,199
will it help me protect them?

438
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:49,336
No promises, but it's
certainly worth a shot.

439
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,607
That said, you do realize
you have a lot of work to do.

440
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:58,144
[LUFFY]
Okay.

441
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:01,181
[LUFFY]
I've made up my mind.

442
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:05,452
If you think I should,
I'll go back...

443
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,154
[LUFFY]
...to Marineford!

444
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:15,896
[NARRATOR]
After learning of Ace's death,

445
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:18,331
Sanji plots to
return to Sabaody.

446
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:20,834
However, his plans are
thwarted when Ivankov

447
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:23,670
makes his long-awaited return
to the Kamabakka Kingdom.

448
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:26,807
Burning with determination,
Sanji begins a fierce battle

449
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,208
with his pride on the line.

450
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,111
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

451
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:31,845
"A Disaster for Sanji!

452
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,081
The Queen's Return
to the Kingdom!"

453
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:36,683
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
