1
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,523
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:40,461
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,697
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,069
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,572
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,739
You can have it!

7
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:56,143
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,345
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,715
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,985
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,455
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,857
Still, that's how he feels.

13
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,294
So trying to reason with him
would be a waste of time.

14
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,130
If you really want
him to go with you,

15
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,232
then your only choice
is to use force.

16
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,367
Since he's not willing
to break that chain,

17
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,569
you'll have to do it for him!

18
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,707
[LUFFY]
Goodbye My Dear Underlings!

19
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,675
Franky Departs!

20
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:41,088
[CITIZENS complaining]

21
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:51,331
[CITIZENS complaining]

22
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,838
[MAN 322A] Put some pants on!

23
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,072
[WOMAN 322A] My eyes!

24
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,242
I'm gonna sue you
for mental anguish!

25
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,943
Think of the children!

26
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:05,078
[MAN 322B] Get outta town!

27
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,083
Gimme back my briefs, Straw Hat.

28
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,219
Sure. Join my crew.

29
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,286
[FRANKY] What, are you stupid?

30
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,355
I'm not gonna be a pirate.

31
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,759
You know? You can keep
those briefs, brother.

32
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:19,793
[TILESTONE] Hm?

33
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:23,563
[FRANKY] Ow!

34
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,536
[FRANKY] Standing before
the crashing waves,

35
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,971
naked and proud,

36
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,674
you wouldn't ask a lion
to put on underwear,

37
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:36,142
so why a man?

38
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,479
[screaming]

39
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,583
He's showing off that bare
bottom loud and proud!

40
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,884
Don't look! No!

41
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,620
Try as I might,
I can't unsee it!

42
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,688
I was a fool!

43
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,557
His determination is too great!

44
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,826
He's a true man! A hero!

45
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:56,029
C'mon! He's obviously
just a pervert!

46
00:04:57,498 --> 00:05:00,767
It might get a little rough,
but shall I lend a hand?

47
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,271
Actually, Ice Pops
said before,

48
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,605
if we want Franky to join,

49
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,642
we're gonna have to use
force to get our way.

50
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,410
But what were you planning?

51
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,282
Try Dos Fleurs.

52
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,065
[ROBIN] Grab.

53
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,708
[screaming in pain]

54
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,810
Robin! What did you do?

55
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,544
Oh man!

56
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:45,712
Ow!

57
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,815
You're gonna crush them, Robin!

58
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,383
Don't do it!

59
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:59,426
[screaming]

60
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,065
She'll tear 'em off!

61
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,434
She's gonna crush 'em to bits!

62
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:10,470
--Like little oranges!
--Like little oranges!

63
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:13,974
[FRANKY]
They're called "tangerines!"

64
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,077
[screaming]

65
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:21,649
[pained whimpering]

66
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:22,916
Robin!

67
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,352
I still want him to be
a man when he joins us!

68
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,686
Lay off!

69
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,655
Just looking at him hurts!

70
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:33,660
[FRANKY whimpering]

71
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,062
What's going on?

72
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,531
They're not fighting,
but Franky's in a lotta pain!

73
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,865
That scream.

74
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,035
It almost sounds like someone
is choking a chicken to death!

75
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,904
I know he's a pervert...

76
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:45,139
But gosh.

77
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,673
Everyone knows
pirates won't give up

78
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,076
on treasure once they've
set their sights on it.

79
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,011
And now that we have
this one in our palms,

80
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:54,080
so to speak, I won't
let go without a fight.

81
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,551
[FRANKY]
C'mon, I already told you!

82
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,718
[choked yelling]

83
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,823
I couldn't leave this
island even if I wanted to.

84
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,024
[choked yelling]

85
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,259
[FRANKY] I appreciate
the offer, really,

86
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:09,530
but it just ain't
in the cards for me.

87
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,965
Sailing the seas
would be great and all,

88
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,467
but there's still a lot of stuff

89
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,002
I have left to
take care of here.

90
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,608
That's why I
gave the ship to you.

91
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,077
[FRANKY] I quit being
a shipwright a long time ago,

92
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,478
and I'm not going back.

93
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,047
This is the last
ship I'm building

94
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,814
for the rest of my life.

95
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,816
I only had one goal
as a shipwright,

96
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,284
and now I've fulfilled it.

97
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,787
I made my ship of dreams!

98
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,556
[ICEBERG] That's a lie, Franky.

99
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,859
You can say what you like,
but I know the truth.

100
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:42,762
This isn't the ship of dreams
that you talked about before.

101
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,100
[ICEBERG] Ship of dreams?

102
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,367
[FRANKY] That's right!

103
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,270
And my dream doesn't end
with blueprints, either.

104
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,771
It's much bigger than that!

105
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,706
[FRANKY] A ship that will
sail with pride and courage

106
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,976
over uncharted waters fighting
its way through every battle,

107
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,578
over every wave!

108
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,480
And when it finally reaches
the ends of the earth,

109
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:04,050
then it will be
my ship of dreams.

110
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,588
One day, I'll design that ship

111
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,823
and hammer the nails
with my own two hands.

112
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:13,360
And when its crew sails,
I'll join as their shipwright.

113
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,563
That way, I'll be there when
the ship reaches its goal.

114
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:17,797
At the ends of the world,

115
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,700
even if it's beat up
and worn out,

116
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,601
I know that my ship will shine

117
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:24,572
brighter than anything
the ocean's ever seen!

118
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,306
[FRANKY]
What do you think?

119
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,841
Pretty awesome, right, Tom?

120
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,342
Ha! You bet!

121
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,811
And if you ride that sucker
down the Grand Line yourself,

122
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,445
then you'll surpass your master!

123
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,014
[laughing]

124
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,316
[KOKORO] It's that
pirate blood of yours!

125
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,485
Gimme a break.
You're all talk.

126
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,221
A thug like you
can't surpass Tom!

127
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,622
[FRANKY] "Thug", huh?

128
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,424
[ICEBERG] See? You're
resorting to violence already!

129
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,492
Gero, gero, gero!

130
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,729
If you're a man,
you do it with gusto!

131
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,236
Yeah, well my dream
is different now!

132
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,437
[ICEBERG] Your dream?

133
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,239
That's not what
this is about at all.

134
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,874
You're not on this island

135
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,010
because of something
you have to accomplish.

136
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,411
You're here...

137
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,248
...because of guilt.

138
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,522
[ICEBERG] Ever since that
day that Tom was taken away

139
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,857
by the government,

140
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,959
you've blamed yourself
for what happened.

141
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,560
It's obvious.

142
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,199
[ICEBERG] But even before
Tom left this island,

143
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,335
he'd already forgiven you.

144
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,538
He had shown you a new path.

145
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,710
[FRANKY] Ships that would
do such a horrible thing

146
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,612
are no longer my ships!

147
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,685
[CROWD exclaiming]

148
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,356
He just hit him.

149
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,727
Tom has never hit Franky before.

150
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,561
What'd you do that for?

151
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,033
They're no longer
your ships, huh?

152
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,036
Don't you ever say that again!

153
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,738
What's wrong with saying that?

154
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,007
I wish I'd never made 'em!

155
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,109
If those ships didn't exist,

156
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:11,411
then nobody
would've gotten hurt!

157
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:17,251
When a ship is built,
no matter what type...

158
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,285
[groans]

159
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,155
It's neither good nor evil.

160
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,758
I don't care what kind of
ships you choose to make

161
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,393
for the rest of your life.

162
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,061
Remember...

163
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,397
[TOM] Even if the ships
you build hurt someone,

164
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,566
even if they
destroy the world...

165
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,667
Even if no one else does,

166
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:36,436
their creator must
love them unconditionally.

167
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,172
The one who made them
must never deny them!

168
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,575
Don't place the
blame on the ships!

169
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:47,013
You must be proud of every
ship you've ever created!

170
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,617
For years,
you've taken punks

171
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,988
from the inner city
streets under your wing.

172
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,823
You've taught them
to be dismantlers.

173
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,290
You've worked as bounty hunters,

174
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,260
and you've protected this
island from attacking pirates.

175
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:02,362
[ICEBERG] All of this
to atone for your sins.

176
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,798
To look after the
city that Tom loved,

177
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,401
that Tom was forced
to leave behind.

178
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:11,471
Although, I don't imagine
most people saw it that way.

179
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,142
No, of course not!

180
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,810
'Cause that's not
what I was doing!

181
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:17,844
Not at all!

182
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,547
[groaning]

183
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,716
You loved shipbuilding
and you gave it up.

184
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,652
You suppressed your dream
for years and years.

185
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,056
Are you going to do that
for the rest of your life?

186
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,291
[ICEBERG]
Tom has already forgiven you.

187
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:33,694
I've already forgiven you.

188
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,563
Nothing you do will change that.

189
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,401
This has gone on long enough.

190
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,574
[ICEBERG] It's time to
forgive yourself, Franky.

191
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:55,983
Live.

192
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,552
And follow the dream
you've buried for so long.

193
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:01,588

00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:04,558

196
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,670
[FRANKY] What the heck?

197
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,542
[FRANKY] A bag?

198
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,177
[ZAMBAI] It's luggage
for your trip, Bro!

199
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,846
[FRANKY FAMILY BEARDFACE]
Move it! We're comin' through!

200
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,781
[MAN 322B]
Ah! It's the Franky Family!

201
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:30,584
--[FRANKY FAMILY] Big Bro!
--[FRANKY FAMILY] We love you!

202
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,587
Now you, too?

203
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:38,225
Big Bro! Forgive us!

204
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,993
We didn't want to trick you!

205
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:41,595
Really, we're sorry!

206
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:42,630
We're sorry!

207
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:45,298
We'll take any punishment
you throw at us!

208
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,834
We aren't smart like you,

209
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,402
but we thought
long and hard about this

210
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,772
and even we know
that it's the only way!

211
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:52,906
Only way, huh?

212
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,808
You guys aren't
making any sense to me.

213
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,677
You think I'm better off
without my only pair of briefs?

214
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:58,945
Huh?

215
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,947
Think I'll be better off
with a bunch of pirates?

216
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,783
Well, I don't care
what you think!

217
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,318
This is my life!

218
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:07,721
And I decide what's best for me!

219
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,189
[FRANKY] I'm the boss, damn it!

220
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,991
You think I'd be happy
living out the life

221
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,027
my underlings planned for me?

222
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,428
You say you thought
long and hard, huh?

223
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,730
If you'd really
thought about this,

224
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,932
you wouldn't have
done it in the first place!

225
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,502
I--I know we're a pain, but--

226
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,873
Is it wrong for us to worry
about you, even a little?

227
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,441
You turned our lives around!

228
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,110
We just want
what's best for you!

229
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,746
We just want our
big bro to be happy!

230
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,682

232
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,790
Ain't that sweet?

Hey! Stop!

00:13:58,672 --> 00:13:59,873
You're going too far!

238
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,676
Come on! He's gonna be a woman!

239
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,444
Can't you hear him crying?

240
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:06,780
She'll tear 'em off!

241
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,083
She's gonna crush 'em to bits!

00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,986
--Like little red grapes!
--Like little red grapes!

243
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,589
[FRANKY] I thought
they were tangerines!

244
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:18,091
Damn it, Robin! Stop it!

245
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,694
You'll pay for this!

246
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:23,063
She'll tear 'em off!

247
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,365
She's gonna crush 'em to bits!

--Like a little apple!
--Like a little apple!

[FRANKY] That's more like it!

250
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,912
[FRANKY] It hurts so much!
I can't stop crying!

251
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:39,313
Robin!

252
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:43,283
[LUFFY] Wait, you're
not doing anything?

253
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:46,353
I only did it one time.

254
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,521
He's just being a big baby.

255
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:50,858
How convenient.

256
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:53,760
Now he has an excuse
to cry all he wants.

257
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:54,461
Huh?

258
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,096
He's faking it?

259
00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:00,334
[FRANKY]
Owwww!

260
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,636
[FRANKY]
It hurts so much!

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,305
I can't stop crying!

00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,398
[CAPTAIN 322A] What do you mean
you haven't found them yet?

263
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,566
Keep searching!

264
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,367
Don't let them get away!

[groaning in pain]

266
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,574
It hurts! Oh, the pain!

267
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,877
Still can't stop crying!

268
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,813
Big Bro!

269
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:48,281
I feel your pain, Bro!

270
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,852
You ain't got a clue
how this feels!

271
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:55,155
[ZAMBAI]
Well, what do we have here?

272
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,657
Some freakjob in his underpants!

273
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:01,595
I think you just stepped into
the wrong part of town, buddy!

274
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,333
Get him, men!

275
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:23,250
[ZAMBAI] What the hell?

276
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:28,021
You won't make a fool of me!

277
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,662
You got a pretty
strong arm, huh?

278
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,030
You're too good to be a thug.

279
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,332
It's a waste.

280
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,634
Wha--What're you trying to say?

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,538

I'm Franky. Hey.

From now on,
the backstreets of Water 7

284
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:52,279
will be ruled
by me, and only me.

285
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:53,513
Got that?

Let's hit up the next place.

Wow, this guy thinks
he's too good for pants!

00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,268
I like it-- Let's have
a drink together, pal!

We'll show you the way
to the bar. Just follow us!

[KIWI] Let go of us!

00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:26,981
It's too early in the day,

298
00:17:27,014 --> 00:17:28,749
and you're too young
to be drinking like that!

299
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:30,483
Take it easy!

300
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:33,153
If you're really thirsty,

301
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:35,856
I can show you where
to get some cola!

302
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,992
So? That sound good to you?

Food... I need... food...

get up and come with me!

Yeah!

Leave your tears behind!

We got bad news, Captain!

That stupid Grandpa of yours
came back for us, Luffy!

He's got a whole

he was leaving!

00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,183
An amateur like you
will probably sink her

355
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:17,351
in less than a week.

356
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,520
You got the finest
vessel on the sea,

357
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:20,587
and no shipwright?

358
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:23,624
That's a real pity...
For the ship, I mean.

359
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:24,858
What can I say?

360
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,159
You don't leave me much choice.

361
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:28,729
I gotta take care of my
masterpiece, after all!

362
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:29,764
So set sail.

363
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:31,932
I'm joining the crew!

364
00:20:31,966 --> 00:20:34,735
Yeah!
We got us a shipwright!

365
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:37,671
Ah! All right!

366
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,176
[KIWI, MOZU] Big Bro.

367
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:44,111
Don't cry. Don't cry.

368
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:47,547
I know Straw Hat's gonna
take good care of him!

369
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,558
[FRANKY] Tom, this is it.

370
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,459
I'm leaving the island.

371
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,063
Will ya teach me how
to draw up blueprints

372
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,064
for one, too?

373
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:07,068
[laughing]

374
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:09,102
What's so funny, huh?

375
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:15,609
[FRANKY] You sure are
working late tonight.

376
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:16,843
What're ya drawin'?

377
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:21,282
[TOM] This here
is hope for our island.

378
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:22,282
It is?

379
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:24,451
[FRANKY]
I know I was a bad student.

380
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:26,920
I know I only
caused you trouble.

381
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:27,921
[ISLANDER 248J] Hey!

382
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,056
Did you guys hear?

383
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,058
Big news from Scrap Heap Island!

384
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:32,058
[ISLANDER 248H]
Did Tom's workers

385
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:34,527
actually finish
the sea train?

386
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:38,498
[FRANKY] But all the same,
thank you for looking after me.

387
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:51,545
[train whistle]

388
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:06,360
[FRANKY] You put together a fine
team of shipwrights, Iceberg.

389
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:09,329
I'm sure they'll
take good care of you.

390
00:22:09,363 --> 00:22:12,365
I'm sorry I've been such
a pain over the years.

391
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:15,202
[FRANKY] Granny Kokoro.

392
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:17,604
Shorty and the rabbit.

393
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:19,240
Yokozuna.

394
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:20,140
Pervert!

395
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:23,444
[FRANKY]
All the lively townspeople.

396
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:24,678
My little sisters.

397
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:27,848
[sobbing]

398
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:30,050
[FRANKY] Sodom. Gomorrah.

399
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:32,687
[FRANKY]
And all my bros.

400
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,488
I love you guys so much.

401
00:22:58,178 --> 00:23:01,381
[FRANKY]
I'm gonna super miss you all!

402
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,654
[SANJI] Put on some pants.

403
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:15,095
[LUFFY]
What? Usopp is coming back?

404
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:17,197
[CHOPPER] Really? Awesome!

405
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,899
[LUFFY]
Hey, turn the ship around!

406
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:19,967
We're going back!

407
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,701
[ZORO] Hold on, both of you.

408
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:26,206
If you let him join the crew
again, I won't forgive you.

409
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,042
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

410
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,910
Departing the City of Water!

411
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:33,046
Usopp Mans Up and Brings
Closure to the Duel!

412
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,082
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
