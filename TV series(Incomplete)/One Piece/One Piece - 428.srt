Bellow a battle cry

00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

We've left the established course

Right now, we're rowing straight toward

00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

Travel across the oceans of the world

Bellow a battle cry

Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16

Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

We da pirate of the "Mass"

All the way to "One piece"!!

Stuff a dream into your empty chest

And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390

[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,227
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,930
in search of the One Piece,
the legendary treasure

40
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,400
left behind by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,170
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,971
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,908
sets sail to become the next
King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,510
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,245
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,314
of the World Government,
which will use

47

[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

two options here.

Give us the beetle or die.

[LUFFY]
Look, I already tried.

59
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,718
The beetle doesn't wanna
join a pirate crew.

60
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,019
So just leave him alone.

61
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,988
You got the wrong idea, idiot.

62
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,623
We're here to take
that beetle prisoner,

00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,159

You're like some sort

Hm. I wonder.
This's a game of luck.

Oh my. Is that so?

83
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,216
Then you're accusing me
of cheating, Franky?

[ROBIN] It came from

[BROOK] Do you think Nami

[FRANKY]
I guess catchin' that beetle

90
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,033
is tougher than they thought.

91
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,635
Instead of playin' cards, why
don't we go give 'em a hand?

You can struggle
as much as you like,

but the more you do,
the tighter the net will get.

102
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,318
To suffocate at
such a young age.

103
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,488

you are the vice captain?

00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,298

for this shameful situation.

[COLT]
I can explain!

110
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,304
The giant beetle we're
after is supposed to be

111
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,439
the guardian of
the island, right?

112
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,875
So, the plan was just
to give 'em a good scare.

113
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,544
Enough to get the beetle
to come to their rescue.

114
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,714
[COLT] But then that noisy
rubber poophead got in the way!

115
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,817
A giant beetle? How strange.

116
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,120
I thought we were looking
for a large needle.

117
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,555
Why would Shiki
need a giant needle?

118
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,691
You never listen
to what I tell you!

119

It's a grande beetle, okay?

Oh. Well then.

00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,534
I wonder if the giant beetle
I happened to pass

same one we're looking for.

[LARGO] I think it was
somewhere around there.

All right, then let's just--

Sure, we could saunter over

and capture the stupid
insect, but that's boring.

It'd be more fun to give

[VILLAGERS cheer]

357
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:53,126
Oh, now this is just pathetic.

358
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,797
Some scrappy nina turns on the
waterworks and you go loco?

359
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,199
It's like a melodrama!
You make me sick!

360
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:01,835
[LARGO]
Death is their only option.

361
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:06,974
Underdogs ready to be put down.
So sad. Heh, heh, heh.

367
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,239
Whoa!

368
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:41,942
[BOSS growls]

369

[ALL gasp]

376
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:01,862
How funny is that?
That dumb beetle.

377
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,230
Killing his own allies!

378
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:04,898
[COLT chuckles]

379
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:08,935

380
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:11,038
[YOKO gasps]
Boss!

381
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,083
Boss!

382
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,219
What's wrong?

383
00:22:26,253 --> 00:22:27,754
No, Boss!

384
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:28,622
This is awful!

385
00:22:28,655 --> 00:22:31,124
It must've been too soon
for him to molt!

386
00:22:31,158 --> 00:22:34,394
I do not claim to be
an entomologist.

387
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,430
But you didn't finish molting.

388
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:39,933
How heartbreaking.
You have my pity.

389
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:42,769
Your screaming and crying
won't do any good.

390
00:22:42,803 --> 00:22:44,905
No one's gonna save
you whining peasants

391
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,174
now that we got
your guardian angel.

392
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,475
[LUFFY]
The fight's not over yet.

393
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:49,276

[LARGO]
Que?

395
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,412
[LUFFY] You didn't risk
your life for nothing.

396
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,849
We'll save your friends, Boss.
We owe you that much.

397
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,784
Leave everything to us!

398
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:05,025
Well. The fun's over.

399
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,094
It's time to get serious.

[NARRATOR] In hopes of
saving the giant beetle

401
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:17,938

402
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:19,940
it's citizens follow
Nami's secret plan

403
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:22,375
and take to the island's
labyrinth-like caves.

404
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,478
Meanwhile, Luffy
chases after Largo,

405
00:23:24,511 --> 00:23:26,012
but finds himself thwarthed

406
00:23:26,046 --> 00:23:29,349
when Largo transforms
his entire body into a net.

407
00:23:29,382 --> 00:23:30,984
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece.
