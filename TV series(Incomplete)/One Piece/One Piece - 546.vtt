00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.757
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.693
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:35.221
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:38.124
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:42.428
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:45.532
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body became rubber

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.100
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:50.803
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:54.941
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.512
[NARRATOR]
Reuniting after their training,

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:02.415
Luffy and his crew continue
on to the New World.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:04.184
The first stop
is Fishman Island,

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:06.786
where they find themselves
pulled into a civil war.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.189
After meeting with Jimbei,
they learn of the events

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:11.858
that led to their battle
with the New Fishman Pirates.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.228
They also learn of Queen
Otohime, who despite opposition,

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:18.798
fought for understanding
between humans and Fishmen.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:19.866
Be careful, Mother!

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.234
Don't go, Mother!

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.669
Queen Otohime!

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.271
I don't get it.
Where is she going?

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.008
[NEPTUNE]
My queen...

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.777
Trust in me.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.079
Have faith in the
woman you married--

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:34.914
and the humans.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:43.690
Goodbye, Mother!

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:46.159
I will miss you!

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:47.894
[MERMAID A]
Come home safe!

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:55.935
[CROWD] Your Majesty!
Please be careful up there!

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.172
[SHIRAHOSHI]
I love you, Mother!

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:11.784
[LUFFY]
"A Sudden Tragedy!

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:14.787
A Gunshot Shuts
Down the Future!"

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.192
[JIMBEI]
Queen Otohime's voyage would

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:22.595
determine the fate of
Fishman Island and its people.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:24.731
Of course, the uncertainty
weighed heavily

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.232
upon our shoulders.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:30.136
But... for her family,
it was even worse I'm sure.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.339
[JIMBEI]
Her children were restless,

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:35.975
awaiting news
of her safe return.

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.911
In this, the island was united.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.813
Whether we were
royalty or commoners,

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:43.783
all we could do was
pray for our queen.

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:47.487
What? A magic box?

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.155
Yep, in the palace.

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:51.891
It's called the
"Tamate Box" to be exact.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:54.460
And it has the power to make
you suddenly grow older?

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.896
Yep! Well, that's what
they say at least!

00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:01.067
So that means if a kiddo
like the princess opened it,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.371
then bam! She'd be a full-grown
sexy babe, lickity-split?

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:07.040
That would be the idea, sir.

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.775
Problem solved!

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.376
That is just what I need!

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.045
Now I can get
married to Shirahoshi

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:13.913
right away and
it won't be creepy!

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.815
Or so I suspect.

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:16.983
Now!

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.252
Go and steal that magic box
thing and steal it quick!

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:20.486
No, wait.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.957
That gate at the palace
is gonna stop us for sure, huh?

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.760
I say you just marry her first
and work out the details later.

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.495
Yeah, everybody
knows you're a creep.

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:30.530
[yelps]

00:05:30.563 --> 00:05:32.465
Now, there's an idea!

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:35.268
Shirahoshi is pretty
cute already.

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:37.003
Even if the box thing
doesn't work out,

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:39.972
if I give it ten years
or so, she'll be a knockout.

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.974
Yeah, but she's gonna
get even bigger, ya know.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.143
Hey, different strokes
for different folks, buddy.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.979
I happen to like
big women just fine!

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.214
Not to mention,

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:50.850
she can control the Sea Kings,
so her powers are big, too--

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:52.985
as big as my ambitions!

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.655
She just needs the
right man in her life,

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:58.725
and we'll have the whole world
in the palm of our hands!

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:01.027
That means money,
money, money, money!

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.862
I'm telling you,
it's my destiny!

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:07.066
The dream of every Decken
since the beginning of time! Ah!

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.901
Now, let's get
started on writing

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:11.270
those wedding
invitations, shall we?

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.439
[DECKEN LACKEYS] You have
to propose to her first!

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:16.042
Wait, I don't have any friends.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.213
[JIMBEI] Days passed
with no word from the queen.

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:22.982
The hearts of her
people grew heavy.

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:25.485
[FISHMAN AA] I really
miss hearing her speeches.

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:31.391
[MERMAID A] Please return
safely, Queen Otohime.

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:33.559
Boss, what's wrong?

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:34.861
Why isn't she back?

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.562
You think somethin'
bad happened?

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:38.564
Keep the faith.

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:41.868
She is fighting to protect
your future, children--

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.803
this island's future.

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.709
[JIMBEI] Our hearts are
with you, Your Majesty.

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:58.651
Please come home.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.794
[NEPTUNE]
Worry not, my children.

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:10.863
Your mother is
a strong and wise woman.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:16.169
[JIMBEI] Although it was but a
week, it felt like an eternity.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:21.307
[JIMBEI]
Then, at long last...

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:34.954
Finally!

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:39.459
[ALL panting]

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:46.299
[CROWD murmuring]

00:07:55.575 --> 00:08:00.847
[FISHMAN D, FISHMAN E gasp]
She's back! Your Majesty!

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.782
[giggles]

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:06.319
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Oh! I was so worried!

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:10.256
I'm not crying, I just
have something in my eye.

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:12.091
[FISHMAN BB]
Welcome home!

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:14.927
[FISHMAN G]
Your Majesty!

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:17.063
[JIMBEI] After several
days of negotiations,

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:18.397
Queen Otohime was able

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:20.900
to quell the fury of
the Celestial Dragons.

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:22.268
And perhaps more importantly,

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:24.237
she brought a piece
of paper back with her

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.373
that would prove a beacon
of hope to our entire island.

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:29.075
In truth, it was
a greater miracle

00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:30.977
than any of us
could have imagined.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.046
[OTOHIME] Everyone, despite
our troubled history with them,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.649
the Celestial Dragons
are very influential.

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:38.150
And by meeting with them,

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.953
I have been able
to bridge a gap.

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:43.689
We may attend the
World Summit yet!

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:45.458
Listen to what they've written.

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:48.895
"To improve humankind's
relationship with Fishmen,

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:51.464
we give this petition,
written by their queen,

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:54.000
our full endorsement."

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:57.270
In other words, if we can fill
my petition with signatures

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:58.905
the world leaders
at the Summit will have

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:01.908
no choice but to recognize
our right to be there,

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:05.278
and furthermore, our right to
be a part of the surface world.

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:08.080
Finally, we will see our dream.

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:09.048
I have mixed feelings

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:10.716
about getting support
from those guys.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.951
I'm still not sure.

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:16.355
And now, it's in your hands.
We still need more signatures.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:21.193
I have found the way, but this
is a path we must walk together.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:24.564
Please, let your cry
for freedom be heard.

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:28.167
Only then can we live above
among our human friends!

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.643
[gasps]

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:42.081
We've come so far.

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:46.185
Please, your signatures
can change our future!

00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:57.530
[CHILDREN giggle]

00:09:57.563 --> 00:10:00.800
Thank you, but don't
get my hopes up...

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:03.669
...if you're just going
to change your mind again.

00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:07.373
[FISHGIRL A] We won't! My mom
said she's gonna sign, too!

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.681
[OTOHIME gasps]

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:21.721

[OTOHIME gasps]

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:45.911
No offense, Majesty,

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:48.547
but I think you're going
to need a much bigger box.

00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:49.582
And you'd better hurry

00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:52.284
'cause the whole country's
gonna be lining up!

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.021
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Don't worry, Your Highness,

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:57.056
I had a feeling
this might happen!

00:10:57.089 --> 00:10:58.958
Those of you who
support our queen,

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:01.661
put your signatures
in here, please!

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:21.480
[wails]

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:28.220
[JIMBEI]
There's only so much we can do

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:30.222
by ignoring our prejudice.

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:33.426
We need someone like her
to take a step forward.

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:36.128
We can denounce hate,

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:40.332
but to instill hope
is a far greater gift.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:44.036
This is our future given life,
sooner than we ever imagined.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.738
She can transform this island

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:47.840
more than a life
of fighting ever could.

00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:51.143
[JIMBEI] I wish that
Arlong understood that.

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:53.079
To save him from hatred.

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:54.613
I wonder...

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:57.083
...what will he
think of our future?

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.786
I wish Tiger were here.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.823
Surely this would
have warmed his heart.

00:12:08.594 --> 00:12:09.695
[MANBOSHI]
Mother!

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:12.631
Signatures keep pouring
in from all over the country!

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:14.667
Things seem to be
progressing well.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.068
[OTOHIME]
It's a dream come true.

00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:18.571
Yeah, and your courage
made it come true!

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:23.709
Well, I... did feel
some inspiration.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.278
I felt as if a new road
had been paved for the future

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:29.081
of our people when
that miracle happened.

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:31.217
[FUKABOSHI]
Miracle?

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.451
[OTOHIME]
Yes.

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:35.821
What else could you call the
appearance of those Sea Kings?

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:38.858
That was nuts!
Think they like us?

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:41.560
No. Shirahoshi called them here.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:42.361
[GROUP gasps]

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:44.263
I don't think it's so strange.

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:46.899
After all, we can
speak to fish, can't we?

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:49.969
That's part of what
it means to be Merfolk.

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:51.737
And yet, whenever
we try to communicate

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.038
with the great Sea Kings,

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:56.575
for whatever reason,
our words fall on deaf ears.

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.010
No one on Fishman Island

00:12:58.043 --> 00:12:59.979
can speak to whales
except for your father.

00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:03.682
But the Sea Kings, well,
they're beyond even him.

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:07.319
They say, in a legend
passed down by our family,

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:10.456
that every few hundred years
a mermaid will be born

00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:12.625
into the royal house
with a fearsome power

00:13:12.658 --> 00:13:15.127
that no one else on
the island possesses.

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:17.196
[FUKABOSHI]
The power to talk to Sea Kings?

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:19.632
[MANBOSHI]
And Shirahoshi is the one?

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:21.267
[OTOHIME]
I believe she is.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.335
And according to
the rest of the legend,

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:25.237
she will meet someone
who will guide both her

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:28.741
and her power in a direction
that will change the world.

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:31.544
I can't wait to see.

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:32.845
Oh, wow!

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:35.014
Of course, if the
world does change

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:37.716
then that will likely mean
a change to this island as well.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.984
Yeah?

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:41.120
You think it'll help with the
World Summit thing you're doing?

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.421
Perhaps...

00:13:42.454 --> 00:13:44.223
...for if it is used with love,

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:46.725
her power could save
thousands of lives.

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:48.594
That is my hope.

00:13:48.627 --> 00:13:50.129
But who can say?

00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:52.998
It may be darkness that
will rule her heart instead.

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:57.203
In that case, her power
could sink the world.

00:13:57.236 --> 00:14:00.005
Of course, Shirahoshi
is just a child.

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:02.374
I'm sure she has
no such intentions.

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.176
But because she is a child

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.880
she has yet to understand her
power and cannot control it.

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:09.982
If something traumatic
were to happen to her,

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:12.885
she could unwittingly cause
the Sea Kings to go berserk

00:14:12.918 --> 00:14:14.486
and in great numbers.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.754
[MANBOSHI]
What?!

00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:18.324
Then our whole island would be
smashed into itty-bitty bits!

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:19.758
What the heck should we do?

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:20.993
Don't worry.

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:24.063
You can count on me to take
care of her for the time being.

00:14:24.096 --> 00:14:26.232
Although one of these days,

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.400
the three of you
must become warriors,

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:30.169
brave and true.

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:33.205
Then, as warriors,
and brothers alike,

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:37.843
use your strength to protect
your sister no matter what.

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:38.577
[MANBOSHI, RYUBOSHI]
Yeah!

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:40.279
But of course!

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:41.614
Thank you.

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:44.650
[JIMBEI]
But even as they made that vow,

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:47.653
they could not have
expected what would come next.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.772
[JIMBEI]
Signatures for the petition

00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:09.308
were mounting at a rapid pace.

00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:12.945
The islanders were still
distrustful of humans,

00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:14.613
but they longed
to see the beginning

00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:17.316
of a new era all the same.

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:19.885
[FISHBOY E]
Hey, Queen Otohime!

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.187
We signed papers again
so you can have more!

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:23.789
That's against the rules!

00:15:23.822 --> 00:15:26.492
Each person can
only vote one time!

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:28.961
[BOTH]
We're sorry.

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:30.362
It's okay.

00:15:30.396 --> 00:15:31.864
Even if I can't accept them,

00:15:31.897 --> 00:15:33.933
it's the thought
that counts, right?

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:36.735
Thank you. I mean it.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:40.339
It seems her persistence
is finally paying off.

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:50.950
[gasps]

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:58.457
[FISHMAN CC]
Get away! Fire! Fire!

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.326
Are we under attack?
What's goin' on?

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:01.593
Water! Get water!

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.028
[AMMO KNIGHT AA]
Quick! Put it out!

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:04.263
Who would do such a thing?

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.365
We'll lose all of the
signatures at this rate!

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:08.033
Hurry, run away!

Wait! Your Highness, no!

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:14.807
It's not too late!
Save whatever you can!

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.308
You can't do this!
It's too dangerous!

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:19.712
I didn't make it this far
just to lie down and give up!

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:22.548
Be careful!

00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:25.050
I will protect them
to my last breath!

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:27.886
These aren't just papers!
This is our future!

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.790
We can't let the future of
our island go up in flames!

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.827
Yes, ma'am!

going on here.

do such a thing?
