1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,822
[NARRATOR] Before
continuing their journey,

38
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,325
Luffy and his crew stopped at
the resort ship Spa Island.

39
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,694
While enjoying their vacation,
the Straw Hat Pirates

40
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:45,098
met two young sisters,
Sayo and Rina.

41
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,301
That's Nukki. He can
transform into anything.

42
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,569
[RINA]
Hey, Sayo!

43
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,773
Fehfehfehfeh!

44
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,509
[FOXY] So this is where you've
been, my dear old rival!

45
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:02,182
Straw Hat Luffy!
It's been a long time!

46
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,384
Now Gum-Gum...

47
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,686
...Bazooka!

48
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,391
[NAMI]
The thing you're holding.

49
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,459
That's what Foxy
was after, wasn't it?

50
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,627
Your notebook.

51
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,461
Yeah, you're right.

52
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,330
The notebook has
special instructions

53
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,498
on how to make a gem!

54
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,332
[SAYO]
Listen.

55
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,867
Everyone, please save--

56
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,704
[NARRATOR] The Silver Fox
Foxy came to Spa Island

57
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:25,705
to steal a notebook

58
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,241
entrusted to Rina
and Sayo by their father,

59
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,377
which contained a secret
method to create a gem.

60
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,580
The Straw Hats
thwarted Foxy's efforts,

61
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:38,518
but Sayo was taken hostage
by Spa Island's owner, Doran.

62
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,420
[LUFFY] The Great
Scramble for Treasure!

63
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,488
Collapse! Spa Island!

64
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,762
Sayo, no!

65
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,198
[USOPP]
What the hell?

66
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,867
This place is
totally booby-trapped!

67
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,306
Come on, Boss!

68
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,675
Say something, please!

69
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,676
[DORAN]
Girugirugiru!

70
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,579
That wasn't your
finest moment, Silver Fox Foxy.

71
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,916
Having to escape through
one of my little traps.

72
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:10,984
No matter.

73
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,519
Now we simply sit back
and let them do the work.

74
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:16,656
We'll know the secret of
making that gem soon enough.

75
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,725
[DORAN]
Girugirugirugiru!

76
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,395
[NAMI] As a chart maker
myself, I can say for sure

77
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,930
that this one doesn't
tell us very much.

78
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:24,998
[USOPP]
Seriously!

79
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,267
You already searched
all over this place, right?

80
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,203
And you didn't find a gigantic
"X" anywhere, did you?

81
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,271
[RINA]
Uh-uh.

82
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,572
So what do we do now?

83
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,208
This stupid notebook has
been nothing but trouble.

84
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,444
And now Sayo has...

85
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,785
Luffy.

86
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,890
Help me save Sayo!

87
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,925
Okay.

88
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,961
What? You will?

89
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,629
Do you really mean it?

90
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,530
Sure!

91
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,998
Besides, I really
wanna see that gem.

92
00:04:59,032 --> 00:04:59,966
[RINA]
Uh...

93
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,468
Even though it could be a fake?

94
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,437
[USOPP] All right,
what's the plan, then?

95
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,705
Let's see.

96
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,274
Hey, I know!
Let's destroy this ship!

97
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,510
[ALL]
What?

98
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,711
Huh?

99
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,546
How the hell is that "Plan A"?

100
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,614
[HAMBURG]
Pupupupu!

101
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,416
Whoa! But what about Sayo?

102
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,717
Yeah, Luffy!

103
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,519
[LUFFY] This way, we should
find her in no time!

104
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,454
[ROBIN] And what of
the hint about the gem?

105
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,656
[LUFFY] The more we destroy, the
easier it'll be to look for it.

106
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,691
Right?

107
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,026
[ZORO]
Then let's get started.

108
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,827
[USOPP]
Zoro...

109
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,995
Luffy's right.

110
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,697
Sitting around wondering if
something is or isn't here

111
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,764
is pointless.

112
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,533
We can't expect things
to just fall in our laps.

113
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:34,867
That may be true,
but don't you think

114
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,969
there's a more delicate way
of going about this?

115
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,037
Come on, Nami.

116
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,505
Do you really believe anything

117
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,941
that artichoke-mustached
moron said to us?

118
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,309
I'm all about this plan.

119
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,544
Yes, so am I.

120
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,480
It doesn't really matter in
the long run if the ship sinks.

121
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,648
Robin, too?

122
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,283
Isn't anybody against this?

123
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,951
The captain said it.
Orders are orders!

124
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:52,885
Yohohoho!

125
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,455
Looks like you're
catching on fast, huh.

126
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,558
[LUFFY] Franky!
You handle the Sunny.

127
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,493
No prob.

128
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,328
Super!

129
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,531
This is why we
can't have nice things!

130
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,566
Right.

131
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,868
Break stuff!

132
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,038
[ZORO] One Hundred
and Eight Caliber Cannon!

133
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,740
[SANJI]
Concasse!

134
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,946
Now Gum-Gum Whip!

135
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,419
Tabasco Star!

136
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,356
[yelling]

137
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,492
[CHOPPER]
Cloven Roseo!

138
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,061
Now! Thunderbolt Tempo!

139
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:37,630
And Clutch!

140
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,933
Three Verse Humming
Arrow Notch Slash!

141
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,568
You're all so strong!

142
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,803
[NUKKI]
Nukki nukki!

143
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:47,340
Give Sayo back to us!

144
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,343
Outta the way, chumps!

145
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,011
Move, move, move!

146
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,882
Nice try!
Didn't hurt a bit.

147
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,617
What? No way!

148
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,452
The bullets
bounced right off him!

149
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,790
My head!

150
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,024
You bastards.

151
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,360
Now you've really
gone and done it!

152
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,462
Weapons Left!

153
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,837
[LUFFY] Hey! Hurry up
and give her back already!

154
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,773
[DORAN]
Damned lunatics!

155
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,380
What's going on?

156
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,494
Oh, holy crap!

157
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:42,495
A cannon?

158
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,397
I thought it was a chimney!

159
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,155
[screaming]

160
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,696
[RINA]
Sayo!

161
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,698
Rina!

162
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,665
What a coward...

163
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,801
Holding her hostage like that.

164
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,972
[DORAN] You think
I'm gonna sit around

165
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,874
and let you
destroy my ship?

166
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,108
Think again!

167
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,044
Do you pirates
have any concept

168
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,548
of the time and resources
it took to build Spa Island?

169
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,419
Girugirugiru!

170
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,364
[SAYO screaming]

171
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:03,926
This guy's gone way too far.

172
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,761
Let her go!

173
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:12,001
[RINA]
Big sis! Sayo!

174
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:17,940
Girugirugiru!

175
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,543
[DORAN] This little girl's
about to go flying!

176
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,716
You leave her alone!

177
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,818
Girugirugiru!

178
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,486
[DORAN] At first I was
just going to wait

179
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,788
and let you solve the
notebook mystery for me.

180
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,824
But it's too late for that now.

181
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:38,194
Hand it over and I'll
return the girl unharmed.

182
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,929
Fine!
Whatever you want! Take it!

183
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:41,864
Just please don't
hurt my sister!

184
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:43,266
[SAYO]
No!

185
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:46,168
Do not give him that notebook!

186
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,770
But why not?

187
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:49,205
[SAYO] Rina, you have
to promise me that

188
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:50,840
you'll solve the secret
of that notebook

189
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:52,808
and complete father's research.

190
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,277
No way! That's crazy!

191
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,545
You have to believe
in our father, Rina!

192
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:57,647
No matter what happens,

193
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,716
you can't give that notebook
to him or anyone else!

194
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:03,786
[SAYO]
Father wanted to save us.

195
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,755
He wanted to save
the whole village!

196
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:09,258
That notebook is carrying
all of his hopes and dreams!

197
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:11,594
I'm begging you.

198
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:13,696
Don't ever give up
on our father's dream!

199
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:15,665
The dream he had for us!

200
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:17,400
No, that's a lie!

201
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,235
He never did anything
for you and me!

202
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:22,071
He was just a dumb liar!

203
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:23,239
Rina.

204
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:24,206
He never...

205
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,243
He never thought about
anyone but himself!

206
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,747
[RINA]
There! All done!

207
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:33,883
Do you think daddy will
like the cake we made?

208
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,318
We worked real hard on it!

209
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:36,552
[SAYO]
Yeah.

210
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,161
Why isn't he home yet?

211
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:46,295
[SAYO]
You know him.

212
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:48,564
He must have made an interesting
discovery or something.

213
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:51,567
[RINA]
Let's go to bed.

214
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,601
[SAYO]
Okay.

215
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,364
[RINA'S DAD]
Wow, look at that.

216
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:22,498
A cake.

217
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:25,101
They must have gone to
a lot of trouble to make this.

218
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:26,569
How thoughtful.

219
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:31,640
There you are.

220
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:33,843
Did I wake you?

221
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:35,945
What's this stuff?

222
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:38,714
Those are 30-year old
insect shells.

223
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:41,384
They're useful for my research.

224
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:44,019
In fact, they went through their
metamorphosis 30 years ago

225
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,021
this very night!

226
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:48,057
Really?

227
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,658
Wait, is this
why you never--

228
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,061
Hey!

229
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:53,095
Look at that cake!

230
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,164
It sure looks delicious!

231
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:56,198
Huh?

232
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:02,104
Wait! Not all at once!

233
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,806
Plus, I made it yesterday.

234
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,143
Sitting out in the heat all
day may have made it go bad.

235
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:10,713
[RINA and NUKKI screaming]

236
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,083
Doctor!

237
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:16,952
He already checked
you out and left, dummy!

238
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,053
He's selfish!

239
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:19,688
And he's crazy!

240
00:12:19,722 --> 00:12:22,391
He never thinks about
anyone else, not even us.

241
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:23,993
Why should I care about him?

242
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:25,127
Hey, uh...

243
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,296
This really isn't the time
to for a family argument.

244
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,731
[LUFFY]
Leave 'em be.

245
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,902
Let 'em sort this stuff out.

246
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:35,004
[SAYO]
Rina.

247
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:36,338
You don't know the whole story.

248
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:38,207
You've got it all wrong.

249
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:42,978
[RINA'S DAD]
I feel bad about the cake.

250
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,680
[SAYO]
It's okay.

251
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,348
She must've
been looking forward

252
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:48,851
to throwing me a party.

253
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:49,852
[SAYO]
Yeah.

254
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:50,953
But within the layers

255
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:52,788
of those 30-year old
insect shells

256
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:55,691
is an ingredient
essential for gem creation.

257
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:59,295
If I had missed that chance, I'd
have to wait another 30 years.

258
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:01,297
I didn't have a choice.

259
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:05,401
[RINA'S DAD]
You aren't angry, are you?

260
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:07,102
That's good.

261
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:10,239
But I don't think the same
can be said for your sister.

262
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:14,143
You have the same
temperament as your mother.

263
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:16,479
But Rina's a lot more like me.

264
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:18,848
She can really hold a grudge.

265
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:22,117
We'll party when
I make that gem!

266
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:24,220
Then we'll eat a cake this big!

267
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:25,387
It'll be fun!

268
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,956
[SAYO]
Sounds good!

269
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:29,191
We'll make it
a surprise for Rina.

270
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:33,395
Nukki nukki!

271
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:34,396
Nukki says that...

272
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,299
"It's true! I was there
and I heard every word!"

273
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,435
Nukki-ki! Nukki-ki!

274
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:41,971
[CHOPPER] Nukki also says that
the reason your father left

275
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:43,472
was to protect you two.

276
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,875
He didn't want the bad guys
looking for his research

277
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:46,909
to hurt you.

278
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:48,477
That's why he left?

279
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:56,852
[RINA]
Wait.

280
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,760
Aw, man.

281
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:05,661
Keep looking!

282
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:08,531
Four-leaf clovers
aren't easy to find!

283
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:09,698
Oh yeah?

284
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:11,834
Then how come big sis has
already found three of them?

285
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,035
Because.

286
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:14,970
Your sister never stopped
believing she would find them,

287
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:15,938
and she did.

288
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:17,439
That makes a difference.

289
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:18,774
"Believing"?

290
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:19,708
[RINA'S DAD]
That's right!

291
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:21,544
Doing research and
four-leaf clover hunting

292
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:23,045
are the same that way!

293
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:25,281
If you believe, work hard,
and never give up,

294
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,316
you'll always succeed.

295
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:28,851
Do you mean it?

296
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:29,985
Okay, then!

297
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:33,455
I vow that I will find a
five-leaf clover no matter what!

298
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:35,524
What? Five-leaf?

299
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:37,860
Hahaha!
All right, then!

300
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,764
Found one!

301
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:44,867
[RINA]
Look! I found one!

302
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,535
A five-leaf clover!

303
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:49,238
Whoa! Rina!

304
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:51,574
That's just amazing!

305
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:53,042
You were right, Daddy!

306
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:55,144
I believed I could
find one and I did!

307
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:56,245
So you did, Rina!

308
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:57,947
That's incredible!

309
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:00,916
[RINA]
Hooray!

310
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,184
Now it's my turn!

311
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:04,453
I'll do my best on my research!

312
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:09,391
[RINA]
That's right.

313
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:12,161
I forgot all about that.

314
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:15,064
I believe. I believe,

315
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:19,201
and if daddy believes it,
then I know it'll come true!

316
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:20,436
Rina!

317
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:21,870
I've changed my mind!

318
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,973
You'll never get this notebook!

319
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:26,141
What's that?

320
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,511
Here we go!

321
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,949
Don't screw with me!

322
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,117
Time for Seis Fleur!

323
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,152
What?

324
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,188
Special Tabasco Star!

325
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,062
C'mon, Nami, hop on.

326
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,801
[NAMI]
Sayo!

327
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,469
[CHOPPER]
Hurry, untie her!

328
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,971
[NAMI]
What the heck?

329
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,073
--A lock?
--A lock?

330
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,282
[DORAN] Where the hell
did you come from?

331
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,183
Fool!

332
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,818
What do you think
you're doing, stop!

333
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,919
Wait!

334
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,390
Three-Sword Style.

335
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,362
Giant Iron Cut!

336
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,076
My! That's really
nice work, everyone.

337
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,080
Why don't you do some
"nice work" too, dammit?

338
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,548
Bastards!

339
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,992
What the hell?

340
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,160
That's just great!

341
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,963
That jerk released all of
the ship's ballasts at once!

342
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,336
Finally!

343
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,139
And now! Time to die!

344
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,483
'kay, Rina. Are you ready?

345
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,152
Yeah!

346
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,987
Now, Third Gear!

347
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,259
Bone Balloon!

348
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:46,498
Get ready
for my Giant Axe!

349
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,945
[DORAN screaming]

350
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,391
[PORCHE]
Boss! Wake up!

351
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,661
What is going on here?

352
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,933
[FOXY yelling]

353
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,437
Time to move out!

354
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,655
Idiot.

355
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,958
Couldn't he have at least
waited until we escaped?

356
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,361
Wow. Awesome!

357
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,465
I always forget how tiny
I get after I use that move.

358
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,207
Dumbass.

359
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,409
Think about what
happens next for once.

360
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,392
[RINA]
A big "X"!

361
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,174
[RINA]
Take that!

362
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,975
[USOPP]
Serves you right!

363
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,318
Look, it's the "X".

364
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,220
And it's gigantic!

365
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,289
I saw it underwater.

366
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,424
That volcano must be
what daddy drew on the map.

367
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,525
Imagine that.

368
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,028
Doran built his island ship
right on top of the clue

369
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,030
to the treasure
he'd been searching for.

370
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,531
For it to be
right under his nose

371
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,501
and never realize it
makes him a first rate idiot.

372
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,218
It's beautiful!

373
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,552
Look at that.

374
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,754
A round rainbow!

375
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,490
[CHOPPER] I've never seen
a round rainbow before!

376
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,292
[BROOK]
Me, either.

377
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,830
I dunno what it
means, but I like it!

378
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,732
[FRANKY whistles]

379
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,701
Hey. Hold on just a second.

380
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,670
Do you think that rainbow's
the gem he was talking about?

381
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,739
Well, now that you mention it,

382
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:44,076
a round rainbow is known as
"The Gem of the Sea".

383
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,478
No way!

384
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,718
What is that?

385
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,087
If the answer is "that's
the gem you were looking for",

386
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,954
then you're dead.

387
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,322
[PORCHE]
You won't get away with this.

388
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,292
Please! Be reasonable!

389
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,295
Whatever the treasure is, you
guys can have the whole thing!

390
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,796
[FOXY, PORSCHE, HAMBURG]
Hey! Get back here!

391
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,300
[NAMI] Not only is
it round, it's backwards.

392
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,636
You see? The order of
the colors is reversed.

393
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,105
The order's backwards? Wait...

394
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,474
[RINA]
What is it?

395
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,142
[SAYO]
I wonder...

396
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,756
That bird's
coming right for us.

397
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,427
[NUKKI]
Nukki!

398
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:36,662
Hey!

399
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,130
It's that monster
change-y thing!

400
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,698
A "sea raccoon".

401
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,369
[NAMI]
A letter?

402
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,572
It seems like Sayo's
instincts about that notebook

403
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,608
were right on the mark!

404
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,576
[NAMI] Luffy and
everyone on your crew--

405
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,512
I hope you're all doing well!

406
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,314
[NAMI and RINA] After
we went our separate ways,

407
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,684
Sayo and I went home and
tried out the idea she had.

408
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,919
[RINA] Just like our
father's formulas said,

409
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,622
we made seven kinds
of colored chemicals.

410
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,357
Then we mixed them
in the same order

411
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,526
as the colors
of the round rainbow.

412
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,672
[RINA and SAYO]
We did it!

413
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,475
[NAMI] They made
the gem after all!

414
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,744
[SAYO and RINA cheering]

415
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,481
[RINA'S DAD]
Sayo. Rina.

416
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,387
[LUFFY]
Look!

417
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,455
This is it!

418
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,657
[ALL]
Amazing!

419
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,392
They say,
"Thanks for everything.

420
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,361
Good luck on your adventures!"

421
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,929
Hey, Luffy.
Lemme take a look at it!

422
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,530
[CHOPPER]
Me, too! Me, too! Me, too!

423
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:46,498
[LUFFY]
Shiny.

424
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,232
Easy!

425
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,568
That thing isn't
a toy, you know.

426
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,541
Hey, what's happening?

427
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,409
Ouch!

428
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,478
It's more of that
stupid candy rain!

429
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,580
[LUFFY]
Lucky me!

430
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,349
[LUFFY]
Oops, dropped the gem.

431
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:04,950
[NAMI]
Where?

432
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:05,884
[LUFFY]
I don't know.

433
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:06,585
[NAMI] What do you mean,
"you don't know"?

434
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,220
It was right there in your hand!

435
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,421
Look for it! All of you!

436
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:10,822
Find that gem right now!

437
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,257
[ALL]
Aye-aye!

438
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:19,798
[BROOK]
Yohohoho!

439
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,700
[ROBIN]
Why are you so excited, Brook?

440
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,635
[BROOK] After learning about
all the great challenges

441
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,571
you've overcome on your journey,
I've realized I must work hard

442
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,640
to earn my place
as your true comrade!

443
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,375
[ROBIN] Actually,
being a true comrade

444
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,777
is not something
you work toward.

445
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,512
[BROOK]
It isn't? Oh, dear.

446
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,946
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

447
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,548
"Brook's Great Struggle!

448
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,584
Is the Path to Becoming
a True Comrade Rigorous?"

449
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,820
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
