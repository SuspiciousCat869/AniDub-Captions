[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,060
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:45,632
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:51,037
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,873
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,410
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,046
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,583
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,653
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,056
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,325
[NARRATOR] With their
journey to Fishman Island

48
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,760
temporarily on hold,

49
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,929
the Straw Hats agree
to help the mermaid Camie

50
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,598
rescue her friend, Hachi.

51
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,732
As a result,

52
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,368
they soon found themselves
locked in a deadly battle

53
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,070
with the Flying Fish Riders.

54
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,105
When their leader, Duval,

55
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,474
was suddenly
unmasked by Luffy,

56
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,810
his strange and shocking
connection to Sanji

57
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,312
was revealed.

58
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:38,051
[SANJI]
You shut your damn mouth!

59
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,524
[LUFFY]
Explosion!

60
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,027
Sunny's Super-Secret Weapon,
Gaon Cannon!

61
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,274
[NAMI]
That face.

62
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,509
I see it,
but I don't believe it!

63
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,644
Whoa.

64
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,013
I thought Sanji's wanted poster
was just a bad drawing,

65
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,782
but here it is, in the flesh.

66
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:10,917
That's rough.

67
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,754
Black Leg Sanji.

68
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,656
You ruined me!

69
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,424
This is all your fault!

70
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,095
Hey, Sanji,
where are you going?

71
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,768
[DUVAL] Can you imagine
how scared ah was,

72
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,837
being hunted like an animal,

73
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,906
the Navy headquarters
hounding me at every turn?

74
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,776
Famous bounty hunters
knockin' at mah door.

75
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,478
I didn't wanna hurt nobody--

76
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:42,649
ah just wanted a life of peace
and quiet, and you destroyed it!

77
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,854
Uh, hey.

78
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,491
Just 'cause
you become a pirate

79
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,427
and got that bounty poster that
doesn't even look like you,

80
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,728
I gotta go into hiding

81
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,064
or someone's gonna
put my arms in shackles

82
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,600
or deliver my head
to the government!

83
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,706
What did I ever do to you?

84
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,609
Give me back my life!

85
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,879
Black Leg Sanji!

86
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,691
Who cares?

87
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,594
Ah! Head!

88
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,999
Listen up, you punk!

89
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:36,669
If you don't take responsibility
for this, then who will, huh?

90
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,737
[SANJI]
Shut the hell up!

91
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,839
I'm more pissed off about
the stupid wanted poster

92
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:40,973
than anyone!

93
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,079
So he's a victim, too.

94
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,013
Poor guy.

95
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:47,947
I guess.

96
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,882
But now I kind of wonder
which one of them

97
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,118
hates that poster more.

98
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,686
Who is that?

99
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,891
[LUFFY] You've been
depressed for long enough.

100
00:05:58,925 --> 00:05:59,826
Shut up!

101
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,161
Why is mine the only
one with a drawing?

102
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,296
--Does this look like
--I thought it was a photo

103
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,264
--my handsome face to you?
--'til you said something.

104
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,567
[ZORO] Who has a
handsome face, again?

105
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:12,171
[SANJI] All the women in the
world are gonna laugh at me.

106
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,141
In a way, I guess
they've both got it bad.

107
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,642
Wasn't expecting that.

108
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,544
What a crazy world we live in.

109
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,513
I dunno if it's a lucky
one or an unlucky one,

110
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,915
but he must have been
born under some kinda star.

111
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,984
Whether this is a
miracle or a tragedy,

112
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,719
it's entertaining either way.

113
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,256
Hey guys, do you think we
can make friends with Duval?

114
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,628
[HACHI] They really do look
the same, don't they?

115
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,497
[ZORO]
Two peas in a pod.

116
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,700
Yohohohoho!

117
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,269
Yohohohoho!
Yoho! Yohohohoho!

118
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,771
[coughing]

119
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,673
When I'm done with this guy,

120
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,975
I'm gonna flatten you!

121
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,543
Well, you go ahead
and take care of things!

122
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,611
We'll sit this one out.

123
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,646
Don't act like it's my fault!

124
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,915
If you didn't want to look
like the stupid wanted poster,

125
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,684
then why didn't you just cut
your damn hair or grow a beard

126
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,086
instead of trying to kill me?

127
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,031
Huh! I didn't think of that!

128
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,600
If you're that stupid,
you can only blame yourself!

129
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,836
Just shut up
and listen to me!

130
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:17,870
[SANJI]
Hm?

131
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,743
[DUVAL] You know, Black Leg,
me and my boys--

132
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,711
We just wanted a simple life.

133
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:29,182
Nothing fancy.
We weren't so bad.

134
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,119
[DUVAL] We were running a
humble little criminal outfit

135
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,153
in these parts,

136
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,289
just trying to make ends meet.

137
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:52,738
Hey, brat!

138
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,107
What d'you think
you're doing to our boss?

139
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,613
[DUVAL]
This little girl yours?

140
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,748
I... I'm sorry, sir!

00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,986
[FATHER 389A]
Please, forgive her!

142
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,020
[MOTHER 389A]
Put my husband down!

143
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,155
[LITTLE GIRL 389A]
Daddy!

144
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,725
These are my best pants!
How are you gonna pay for this?

145
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,027
Huh?

146
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,264
[LITTLE GIRL 389A]
Daddy!

147
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,632
[MOTHER 389A]
Darling!

148
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,401
[DUVAL] We didn't
do anything wrong.

149
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,937
We just extorted
some money from people.

150
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,007
It was a simple life,
but a happy one.

151
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,180
[DUVAL] But one day,
it all came crashing down.

152
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,250
My innocent little dream
turned into a nightmare!

153
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,151
Oh man,
what d'you think he did?

154
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,420
It seems like a pretty
big bounty, doesn't it?

155
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:45,091
I guess the Navy really thinks
Duval is dangerous, huh?

156
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,125
[RANDOM GUY 389D]
Here he comes!

157
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,994
[RANDOM GUY 389E]
Don't go anywhere near him!

158
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,295

They're gonna arrest us, too!

159
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,930
[RANDOM GUY 389D]
Get away!

160
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,700
[DUVAL]
That's weird.

161
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,269
Why'd everybody run away?

162
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,108
[DUVAL] I didn't think
much of it at the time.

163
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,744
I just figured the village
had finally learned to fear me.

164
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,046
You know, on account
of me being so tough.

165
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,749
[DUVAL] But that
was wishful thinking.

166
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,624
[MARINE CAPTAIN 389A]
I don't know what you're doing

167
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,726
all the way out here,
but we found you.

168
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,195
Now surrender and save
us all some trouble.

169
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,097
Wait, why's the Navy here?

170
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,802
[MARINE CAPTAIN 389A] Don't play
dumb with us, Black Leg Sanji!

171
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,841
No way!

172
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,944
You mean I'm a wanted man?

173
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:42,181
77 million berries?!
But wait, that ain't my name!

174
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,916
Attack!

175
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,353
[DUVAL screaming]

176
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:51,190
[DUVAL] I ain't Sanji!
I ain't even met the guy!

177
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,346
[DUVAL]
They're gonna kill me!

178
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:03,527
[DUVAL]
Understand, Black Leg?

179
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,363
It's not my fault.

180
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,566
I never wanted to cause
any trouble, and suddenly,

181
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:11,102
I get a bounty of 77 million

182
00:10:11,135 --> 00:10:13,237
because you don't
know how to behave.

183
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,506
[DUVAL]
A small town guy like me

184
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:18,743
can't stand up to all
those powerful Marines.

185
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:20,344
They hunted me down,

186
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:23,214
and now I gotta hide
behind that iron mask,

187
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,683
so nobody will
recognize my face!

188
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:28,285
My whole life is ruined
because you decided

189
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:29,353
to be a damned pirate!

190
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:32,056
I'm gonna chase you all
the way to the end of hell

191
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,257
if that's what it takes!

192
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,725
And if you got
a problem with that,

193
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,628
then why don't you just
kill me and get it over with?

194
00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:43,367
Help me! He's killing me!

195
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:46,237
You're telling me you put
Nami and Robin in danger,

196
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,105
even though they have
nothing to do with this,

197
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:51,676
because some moron
drew a crappy picture of me?

198
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:52,743
'Cause they're part of the crew

199
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,846
that made you a famous
pirate in the first place!

200
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,381
[DUVAL]
If I'm gonna take revenge,

201
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:59,417
I might as well wipe out
the rest of your crew

202
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,851
while I'm at it, right?

203
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:03,187
None of you are
makin' it out alive!

204
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:06,223
[SANJI]
Poison harpoons?

205
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:14,098
Convert to trap mode!

206
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,100
Huh? Pervert?

207
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:25,109
If the Head says
you die, you die!

208
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,110
Take him down!

209
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,180
You suckers don't know
when to quit, do you?

210
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,420
You couldn't resist, could you?

211
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:40,758
This looks bad.

212
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:43,694
Sanji!

213
00:11:43,728 --> 00:11:45,896
They're gonna pull him
into the ocean and drown him!

214
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,265
Sanji! Get outta there, quick!

215
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,502
It's no use!
It's made of iron!

216
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:54,171
Say hello to a watery grave!

217
00:11:54,205 --> 00:11:55,473
Oh no!

218
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:04,582
Hang in there,
Sanji, I'll save you!

219
00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:05,750
We don't need
both of you drowning.

220
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:07,585
Let me handle this one!

221
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:08,419
[HACHI]
I'm on it!

222
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:10,354
You humans are
too slow underwater!

223
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:11,789
You'll never catch up in time!

224
00:12:12,723 --> 00:12:13,891
You're right.

225
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:16,660
But you don't stand a chance
against the speed of my men.

226
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,329
--[HACHI] Nyuu?
--[DUVAL] C'mon,

227
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,196
even you should know
that Flying Fish

228
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,599
are the fastest
creatures in the sea!

229
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:23,701
And my men have oxygen tanks,

230
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:25,236
so they can take
their sweet time

231
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:26,103
making sure
your little friend

232
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:28,506
is nice and dead
by the time he comes up!

233
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,841
See? I thought of everything!

234
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,443
Nyuu!

235
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:38,182
I wish I could've
crushed the life

236
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,251
out of that bastard
with my own two hands,

237
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:42,853
but at least I know
he'll die suffering!

238
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,688
What did you say?

239
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,824
[laughing]

240
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:51,629
This is what happens when
you piss off the Head, pal!

241
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,732
[SANJI]
I'm gonna pass out.

242
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:01,839
[CAMIE]
It's all right.

243
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,813
Camie, no!

244
00:13:08,846 --> 00:13:10,447
Hey! Cowboy!

245
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:13,984
I think you may have forgotten
about a little someone.

246
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:15,019
Like you said,

247
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:17,721
flying fish are definitely
faster than fishmen.

248
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,490
And when it comes
to sea creatures,

249
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:21,358
they're in the top class.

250
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:23,227
But, just to let you know,

251
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,896
there is one creature
that's even faster than that.

252
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,398
Mermaids.

253
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:33,804
[PAPPAGU] In every sea
in this wide world,

254
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:37,274
there's nothing great or small
that can outswim a mermaid!

255
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:42,980
[CAMIE]
Don't worry, Sanjichin.

256
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:45,916
I'll be there real
soon, okay? Hold on!

257
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,554
She's really that awesome?
I never knew.

258
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:52,723
Yeah, and if she wasn't
spacing out all the time,

259
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:54,558
nothing would ever
be able to catch her.

260
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:55,826
It is what it is.

261
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,561
I see!

262
00:13:57,595 --> 00:14:01,298
Camie! We're counting
on you! Good luck!

263
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:11,508
[NAMI]
Uh-oh. What is that?

264
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:14,712
[FRANKY] Looks like an anchor,
but crap, that's huge!

265
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:17,882
[FISH RIDER 388A] Aim for
the center of the ship!

266
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:20,684
Once we drop this,
they'll sink like a rock!

267
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:22,553
[FISH RIDER 388A] Some of 'em
have Devil Fruit powers,

268
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:25,489
so that'll take out
half the crew!

269
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:26,156
This bites.

270
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,658
No way we can survive that.

271
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:29,660
Then dodge it--
use the Burst or the Paddle!

272
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:31,061
Is there time?

273
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:32,863
No, it's too late.

274
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:34,732
[FRANKY]
Usopp, hurry. Come with me!

275
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:36,934
[USOPP]
Huh? O-Okay!

276
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:39,336
Go to the bow
and stay on standby!

277
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,405
[USOPP] I don't get it,
but whatever you say!

278
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:43,974
We're gonna bust out
our super-secret weapon!

279
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,776
What super-secret weapon?

280
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:50,047
They're gonna sink the Sunny!

281
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,683
Somebody do something!
Anything!

282
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:54,585
[FISH RIDER 388A]
Drop it!

283
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,487
No...

284
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,756
We seem to be
in quite the pinch.

285
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:05,429
Now die!

286
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:08,198
[USOPP]
Franky, hurry!

287
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,671
They're gonna sink the Sunny!

288
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:33,073
Somebody do something!
Anything!

289
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,144
Sunny won't die. Believe it.

290
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:39,880
The mane is spinning!

291
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:41,348
Is that supposed to happen?

292
00:15:41,382 --> 00:15:43,717
Now die!

293
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:46,020
[USOPP]
Franky, hurry!

294
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:48,989
[CHOPPER screaming]

295
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,693
[FRANKY] Emergency
Evacuation Secret Weapon.

296
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:54,795
Chicken Voyage!

297
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,006
[FISH RIDERS]
They dodged it!

298
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,007
Hey, that's cheating!

299
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,043
How the hell do you make
your ship go backwards

300
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:09,977
in the first place?

301
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,112
Usopp, get inside the prow!

302
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:14,214
[USOPP]
Get inside?

303
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:16,150
Whoa! It opens!

304
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:23,657
[USOPP]
I thought I'd seen it all,

305
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,026
but Franky really
outdid himself!

306
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,094
[FRANKY]
Don't worry, brother.

307
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:28,996
We're not just running away.

308
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,331
The Sunny's got another trick

309
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,033
that's about to
knock your socks off!

310
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:37,071
Awesome!

311
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:39,740
[FRANKY]
Cola Energy charging!

312
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:46,347
What is that?

313
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,848
Uh-oh.

314
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:55,956
[USOPP]
Charging complete!

315
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:58,092
Hey! What am I
supposed to do now?

316
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,427
[FRANKY] Get as many
as you can in the circle!

317
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:03,964
[USOPP]
The circle? Like this?

318
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:10,571
'kay, they're in!

319
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:14,308
[FRANKY] Lock on with the button
below you, then pull the lever!

320
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:15,776
Below me, huh?

321
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:16,810
Ah!

322
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,417
Hey, look, it's glowing!

323
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:32,960
[FRANKY]
Gaon Cannon...

324
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:34,928
...Fire!

325
00:17:57,818 --> 00:17:59,086
[NAMI]
Amazing!

326
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:25,646
[HACHI]
Nyuu?

327
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,781
You are way too
impressed with this.

328
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,922
[FRANKY]
How d'you like that?

329
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:36,990
Now you've seen the
Sunny's true power!

330
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:39,993
[CHOPPER] You got almost all the
flying fish guys in one shot!

331
00:18:40,027 --> 00:18:41,995
[FRANKY] Well, you can
thank Usopp for that one.

332
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:44,164
Not bad for a first try, huh?

333
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,201
Yes! Go me!

334
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:48,869
Sunny!

335
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:50,170
Good show, Mr. Lion,

336
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:52,506
my eyes nearly
popped out of my head!

337
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:56,310
[BROOK] Or they
would have, if I had any.

338
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,415
Chicken Voyage uses
3 barrels of cola up front,

339
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:04,918
but right after, it also fires a
2 barrel Coup de Burst in back

340
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:07,054
to stop the ship
from getting blown away.

341
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:09,289
In other words, it uses
a butt-load of cola,

342
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:11,358
so it's not something
we can do often.

343
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,195
[FISH RIDER 389B]
She tied us up in the net!

344
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:17,564
[FISH RIDER 388M]
Damn it, that mermaid's fast.

345
00:19:17,598 --> 00:19:19,800
Hold on, Sanjichin,
we're gonna make it.

346
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,235
We're almost there.

347
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,374
It's Camie!

348
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:28,876
Oh, thank goodness!

349
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:30,911
Is Sanji okay?

350
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:32,546
[CAMIE] I don't know,
but something's wrong!

351
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:35,883
He's losing a bunch of blood
for some reason!

352
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:36,950
[CHOPPER]
Is he dying?

353
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:38,352
I thought he was okay at first,

354
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,554
but blood started
pouring out of his nose!

355
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:43,056
A... nosebleed?

356
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,293
Eh, he's fine.

357
00:19:46,326 --> 00:19:48,529
If he wants to die
like that, then let him.

358
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,131
Yep. It's what
he would have wanted.

359
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:53,033
[CAMIE]
Hang in there, Sanjichin!

360
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,168
[SANJI] Did I die
and go to heaven?

361
00:19:55,202 --> 00:19:56,336
You little punk!

362
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,606
If you weren't friends with
a mermaid, you'd be dead!

363
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,843
[LUFFY] Looks like you lost
a lot of men back there.

364
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:05,112
Shut your mouth!

365
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:06,580
[DUVAL] I don't need
the Flying Fish Riders

366
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:08,582
as long as
I've got Motobalo.

367
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:11,218
You think I ride this guy
cause he looks cool?

368
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,152
Ha!

369
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:14,054
Countless have
fallen prey to his horns!

370
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,290
He poked holes
in the village dam back home

371
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:19,326
and if you try putting him
in a cage, he smashes the bars!

372
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,061
The Marines keep hounding me,

373
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,997
but I escape them every time
'cause this guy is always ready

374
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:25,265
to bust some heads!

375
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:27,234
[DUVAL]
They don't call his horns

376
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,036
the "Heart Rippers"
for nothing!

377
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,105
Okay. Let's rock.

378
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,276
Gooo... Motobalo!

379
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:39,413
Luffy! No!

380
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:47,588
The horns can't even reach him!

381
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,556
There's no point
in fighting, you big cow.

382
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,857
Stop it.

383
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:02,569
[DUVAL]
Motobalo, what's wrong?

384
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:05,005
Cow's acting weird
all of a sudden.

385
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:14,948
[FRANKY]
What happened?

386
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,183
[USOPP]
Guess it passed out.

387
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:18,185
Did I just miss something?

388
00:21:18,218 --> 00:21:20,587
Hey Luffy! What was that?

389
00:21:21,722 --> 00:21:24,157
I didn't do anything, I think.

390
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:25,959
[DUVAL]
Motobalo!

391
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,428
Why does my life suck so much?

392
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:30,697
Whatever he did, it didn't
seem like an attack.

393
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:32,666
It's more like he
won the animal over,

394
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:35,535
or at least knocked it over when
he spoke to it face-to-face.

395
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:36,703
What's that supposed to mean?

396
00:21:36,737 --> 00:21:39,072
Are you saying he
psyched the thing out?

397
00:21:39,106 --> 00:21:41,475
Sure, Luffy's tough,
but that ox doesn't know that.

398
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,076
Maybe it's just a scaredy cow.

399
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,277
[DUVAL]
Straw Hat.

400
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:46,580
I'm gonna murder you!

401
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,351
[SANJI]
Hey. Hold on, Luffy.

402
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,989
Sanji!

403
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,958
Glad you made it out okay.

404
00:21:57,991 --> 00:22:00,360
[SANJI] Stand back and let me
take care of this whiner.

405
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:02,429
I just met him and he's
already been a pain in my ass

406
00:22:02,462 --> 00:22:03,597
for too long.

407
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,698
[DUVAL]
Your ass?

408
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:06,299
Look who's talking, Black Leg!

409
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,169
Until you're dead,
an innocent guy like me

410
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,705
can't find a moment
of peace in this world!

411
00:22:11,738 --> 00:22:13,273
You're the criminal here!

412
00:22:13,306 --> 00:22:15,509
And ah'm sick of
paying for your crimes!

413
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,077
That's enough.

414
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:19,012
[SANJI]
How do you think I feel

415
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,481
seeing that crappy
picture come to life?

416
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:25,185
A stupid face like that
shouldn't exist in this world!

417
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,620
You don't wanna see it?

418
00:22:26,653 --> 00:22:29,389
Then just die!

419
00:22:31,258 --> 00:22:34,761
[SANJI]
Oeil! Nez! Joue!

420
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:38,065
Bouche! Dents! Menton!

421
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:44,037
[DUVAL]
Please stop it.

422
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,540
Parage Shot!

423
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,308
Now eat this.

424
00:23:05,726 --> 00:23:08,028
That's a full course
of my best techniques,

425
00:23:08,061 --> 00:23:09,463
served up free of charge.

426
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:11,698
And it's the last
you'll ever taste,

427
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:13,433
you piece of crap.

428
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,507
[PAPPAGU]
Attention!

429
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,542
Since you guys seem
completely clueless,

430
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:24,544
I'll tell you how to
reach Fishman Island!

431
00:23:24,578 --> 00:23:27,547
First, your ship needs to
be coated at a certain location.

432
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:28,448
The name of that location--

433
00:23:28,482 --> 00:23:29,783
[CAMIE]
Look! There it is!

434
00:23:29,816 --> 00:23:30,650
[LUFFY]
Awesome!

435
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:32,119
Look at all the bubbles!

436
00:23:32,152 --> 00:23:34,821
[PAPPAGU] Camie,
I wasn't finished talking...

437
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:36,423
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

438
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,459
"Disembarking with Sights
Set on Fishman Island!

439
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:41,628
The Sabaody Archipelago!"

440
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:44,131
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
