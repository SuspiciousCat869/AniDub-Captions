there's an awesome treasure

will be King of the Pirates!

You find this
interesting? Why, Luffy?

Because escape is
supposed to be impossible!

This is the balcony
to my office.

Now. Fire the cannons.

93

fire at the central tower,

102
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:27,233
[JONATHAN]
Indeed.

103
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:29,652
Are you still planning to do
that, Straw Hat Luffy? Leave?

104
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:31,821

Yep! We're leavin' right now!

You're funny.

can escape from Navarone?

We can still catch them!

116
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,654
Unit 21's waiting in Block 7.

117
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:14,489
If the pirates head down there,

118
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:17,367
we can take them down
once and for all!

119
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:22,706
No. Have Unit 21 withdraw
from Block 7 immediately.

120
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:26,001
But, sir, it's a dead-end,
perfect for an ambush!

121
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,086
Only if the Straw Hats
played by the book.

122
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:30,422
That kid didn't get
a 100-million-Berry bounty

123
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:33,008
on his head by
doing the obvious.

124
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:35,343
Besides, it would just
result in more injuries

125
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,679
and further damage to this base.

126
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:39,389
Navarone's seen enough of both.

127
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:41,141
Don't you agree, Sergeant?

128
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:43,101
[SERGEANT]
Yes, sir.

129

Instead of focusing
on where they might go,

130
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:47,355
let's focus on where
they will go.

131
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,400
Their ship is moored in Dock 88,
and it's only a matter of time

132
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:53,111
before those pirates reach it.

133
00:06:53,194 --> 00:06:54,571

Sir!

137
00:07:00,243 --> 00:07:02,203
[JONATHAN] I want you and your
men to break off your pursuit

138
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:03,705
and rush to Dock 88.

139
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:06,416
Set up an ambush there and
apprehend the Straw Hats.

140
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:08,084

Sir?

143

Won't it take
Lieutenant Commander Drake

144
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:15,467
some time to reach Dock 88?

145
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,802
That's true.

146
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:20,096
There's only one way for
the Straw Hats to reach

147
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,266
Dock 88, and it's by
crossing this bridge.

148
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,226
We'll leave the Straw Gate
on the upper deck seemingly

149
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,520
unguarded to lure them across.

150
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:29,564
Yes, that should work.

151
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:31,274
We'll have troopers
concealed on both ends

152
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:33,526
to ambush the pirates
when they cross.

153
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,029
They don't need to stop them,
just slow them down.

154
00:07:36,112 --> 00:07:37,906
That should buy us some time.

155
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,616
Good thinking.

156
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:40,867
[JONATHAN]
Now then.

157
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,495
Which unit should I send
to defend the bridge?

158
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:47,665
[JONATHAN] I guess there's
really only one unit who might

159
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,250
slow them down.

00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:30,291
Excuse me.

175
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,376
Yes, ma'am?

176
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:33,169
[KOBATO]
The alarm? What's going on?

177
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:35,547
Jailbreak, ma'am.
It's those pirates.

178
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,134
We're under a code red situation
until they've been recaptured.

179
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:40,844
The brass thinks some
of them might be holed up

180
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:42,595
on the base somewhere.

181
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,930
Those morons!

182
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:46,474
Why couldn't they wait
until we were all together?

183
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:48,476
Now I'll bet Luffy and
the others are on their way

184
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,771
to the dock where the <i>Going</i>
<i>Merry</i> 's been impounded.

185
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:54,024
Then that means Luffy
must have rescued Zoro!

186
00:08:54,107 --> 00:08:55,442
That's great news!

187
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:57,736
It would be if we knew
the layout of this fortress

188
00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:59,320
or even had an escape plan.

189
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:01,448
Leave it to Luffy to
forget the important stuff.

190
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:04,284
I swear that guy is
so absentminded!

191
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,828
Yeah, but now we don't
have any choice.

192
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:09,289
We've got to get to that
dock, too, and quick.

193
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:10,540
You're right.

194
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:11,750
We've gotta get out of
here and meet up with

195
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,294
the others before it's too late.

196
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:16,421
The only problem is them.

197
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:20,133
In fact, Lieutenant Commander
Drake is sure one of the pirates

198
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:22,218
is disguised as a medlab doctor.

199
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:23,595
[MARINE E]
We have to search the premises!

200
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:25,972
Bloodthirsty pirates
could be in there with you!

201
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:27,223
[KOBATO gasps]

202
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:28,808
[MARINE E]
Dr. Kobato?

203
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:29,684
[BOTH gasp]

204
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:32,979
Bloodthirsty... in disguise...

205
00:09:33,063 --> 00:09:35,315
You two!

206
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:41,196
[NAMI]
Umm... Yes, Dr. Kobato?

207
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,907
I guess we shoulda
told you this earlier,

208
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,285
but those pirates
they're looking for...

209
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:50,914
[NAMI, CHOPPER whimpering]

210
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:52,165
Don't you worry!

211
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:54,918
Everything will be okay!
We'll get you to safety!

212
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:56,920
You heard what those men said.

213
00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:59,798
There are pirates
disguised as doctors!

214
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:02,842
And for all we know,
they could be nearby!

215
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:05,637
Um, yeah, about that.

216
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,763
They are nearby.

217
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:08,640
Because they're kinda us.

218
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,600
We're who they're looking for.

219
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:13,937
Don't you get it, doctor lady?

220
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,605
We're the pirates!

221
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:19,275
Look, you seem like
a nice person, and we're

222
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,527
sorry to put you through this!

223
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,696
We won't hurt you,
so don't scream!

224
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,823
All we want from you is
the location of the docks

225
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:26,616
so we can get back to our ship!

226
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,827
[whimpers]

227
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,371
[screams]

228
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:34,124
[KOBATO]
You're the pirates!

229
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:36,835
[KOBATO screams]

230
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:40,255
[NAMI, CHOPPER screaming]

231
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:42,215
--[MARINE E] That scream!
--[MARINE F] Dr. Kobato!

232
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:44,092
[knocking]

233
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:46,094
[MARINE E]
What happened?

234
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:48,680
[MARINE F]
Are you all right?

235
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:49,639
[MARINE E]
Something's wrong!

236
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:51,057
[MARINE F]
Let's knock it down!

237
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:52,767
[MARINE E, F grunting]

238
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:55,228
--[MARINE E] Hold on!
--[MARINE F] We're coming!

239
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:56,855
Doctor?

240
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:59,607
[MARINE E]
What the--?

241
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:00,650
[MARINE E]
Are you all right?

242
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,485
Miss, say something!

243
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:08,199
[MARINE E] They escaped
through the air ducts!

244
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:11,661
[CHOPPER whimpering]

245
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:15,081
Nurse, you're sure the
pirates went up there?

246
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:16,291
Uh, yes!

247
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:18,877
And if you hurry you
can probably catch them!

248
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:24,090
[KOBATO grunts]

249
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:25,258
Oh, you're awake.

250
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:26,217
[KOBATO gasps]

251
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:27,594
None of that!

252
00:11:27,677 --> 00:11:29,137
I know you wanna
scream right now,

253
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,098
but I need you to promise to
stay quiet for a little bit.

254
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:33,183
[KOBATO]
Mm-hm.

255
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:34,309
[CHOPPER]
Nami!

256
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:37,145
We've gotta get out
of here right now!

257
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:39,230
You-- You were big.

258
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:40,440
But how?

259
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:41,941
Oh, what, that?

260
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:45,820
Here, I'll show you.

261
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:47,781
You see, I ate a
Devil fruit once,

262
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:51,201
and that's what gave me
the ability to transform.

263
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:53,703
[NAMI]
She really is a ditz.

264
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:56,456
Uh, look, we'd love to sit and
chat, and explain to you how

265
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,958
Chopper's powers work, but if
you haven't already noticed,

266
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,002
we're a little pressed for time.

267
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:02,420
It's okay.

268
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:05,423
What a strange day
this has become.

269
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:07,092
Well, we've gotta go.

270
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:08,385
It shouldn't take
those Marines too long

271
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:10,387
to realize we're
not in the ducts.

272
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,013
Uh, Mr. Deer, wait!

273
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:13,223
Hold on!

274
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:15,308
Even if you are a pirate
and a magical deer,

275
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:17,268
you're still the only
person who ever taught me

276
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:19,646
what it truly means
to be a doctor!

277
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:22,524
I would really like to
find a way to thank you.

278
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:24,901
Oh, that's okay, you
don't have to thank me!

279
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:28,196
And for the record,
I'm a reindeer!

280
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,407
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

281
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,866
Wait a minute, you two said

282
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,035
you needed to go to
the docks, didn't you?

283
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,495
[CHOPPER]
Yeah.

284
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:37,038
Well, I can show you the way
there if you'd like me to!

285
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:38,456
[NAMI]
You'll take us there?

286
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,251
But won't you get into
trouble for helping pirates?

287
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:42,627
They'll throw you
in the brig for sure

288
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:44,504
if anyone finds out about it.

289
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:47,048
Oh, yeah, right. Ah!

290
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:49,551
But in the event we get caught,
I'll just look real scared

291
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:52,846
and tell them that
you've taken me hostage!

292
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:54,055
Great!

293
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,933
I'm so glad
I could be of service!

294
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:06,067
[USOPP] I don't think
they can see us here, guys.

295
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:08,361
Careful. Fortress Guy's
probably just waiting

296
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:10,155
for us to stick our necks out.

297
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:11,865
Like you're doing right now?

298
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:13,408
Get down here!

299
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:15,076
[USOPP]
See that path down there?

300
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,911
Dock 88's on the
other side of it.

301
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:19,664
That's where they've got
the <i>Going Merry</i> stowed.

302
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:21,708
Yeah, but how do we
get across, though?

303
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,793
There's lots of guards.

304
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:25,754
What about up there?

305
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:30,008
Well, it looks crossable.

306
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:32,010
Yeah. It sure does.

307
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:33,845
But isn't it strange
there are no guards?

308
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:36,348
It's almost like they're
inviting us up there.

309
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:37,891
A trap, huh?

310
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:39,434
A trap?

311
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:41,269
Who cares? Let's just go for it.

312
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,730
I'm not scared.
What about you guys?

313
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:46,232
Worrying about annoying
stuff is annoying.

314
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:48,151
I say we do it.

315
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:52,530
If it really is a trap,
we'll just spring it.

316
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:53,698
Hey, Luffy!

317
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:55,617
Sanji! Zoro! Hey, wait!

318
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,869
Don't I have a say
in this? Fine!

319
00:13:57,952 --> 00:13:59,704
If you guys get
caught in a trap,

320
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:01,915
I'm not gonna
rescue you, ya hear?

321
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:04,376
And without my help,
you're all gonna die!

322
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:06,044
Is that what you want?

323
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:08,713
Um, but, uh, if I
get caught in a trap,

324
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:10,715
you guys'll rescue me, right?

325
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,175
Please say yes!

326
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:32,070
Do you have any idea which
dock your ship was taken to?

327
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:34,072
There are actually
a number of docks here,

328
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:35,699
but they're scattered
all over the base.

329
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:38,451
[NAMI] Well, I can't be certain,
but judging from where our ship

330
00:14:38,535 --> 00:14:40,286
touched down, I'd
have to guess a dock on

331
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,080
the western side of the base.

332
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:43,289
Oh.

333
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:45,417
Then I think I know
where your ship may be.

334
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,418
Dock 88.

335
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:48,837
What makes you
think that, Doctor?

336
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,213
Well,

337
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:51,589
due to recent budget cuts,

338
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:53,216
a lot of our docks
have been shut down,

339
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,593
including most on the
western side of the base.

340
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:58,096
However, Dock 88 is one of
the few docks on that side

341
00:14:58,179 --> 00:14:59,514
that's still operational.

342
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:00,598
My father works there.

343
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:02,809
I'm sure that's
where your ship is.

344
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:06,187
[CHOPPER] Think that's where
Luffy and the others are headed?

345
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:08,857
We've got no way of knowing,
