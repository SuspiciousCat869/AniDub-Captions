1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,116
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:42,020
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

39
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:45,256
and everything else
the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,261
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,995 --> 00:02:52,430
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

42
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,531
You can have it!

43
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:57,135
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

44
00:02:57,168 --> 00:03:00,071
Now you just have to find it!

45
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:03,308
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

46
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:06,477
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

47
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:09,948
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

48
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:12,684
[NARRATOR] After leading
the Straw Hat Pirates

49
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:14,485
into their trap,
the bounty hunters

50
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,654
began to make their move.

51
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:21,125
[laughing]

52
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,362
A total bounty
of over 600 million.

53
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:26,564
Hurry up and show them to me!

54
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,469
Don't get a chance
like this every day.

55
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,170
[CAMPACINO] A toast!

56
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:34,639
To our beloved Papa, Don Accino,

57
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,075
and to the rest of the
Accino Family, as well!

58
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:38,710
May fortune bless us all!

59
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:41,112
And to the present
for our Papa...

60
00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:43,248
...the bounty of the Straw Hats!

61
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:44,515
[ALL] Cheers!

62
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:49,254
[LUFFY] The Dream
Sinking in the New World!

63
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:51,456
The Disillusioned
Pirate, Puzzle!

64
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:59,330
[USOPP] The icebergs
are moving on their own?

65
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,232
[ZORO]
Come on! Don't be ridiculous.

66
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:03,434
There's no way
that could happen.

67
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:05,270
Ridiculous or not,
something strange

68
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:06,271
is going on here.

69
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:07,639
[sneezes]

70
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:10,508
[NAMI] She's right.

71
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,609
They are moving,

72
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:13,645
and not in the same direction
as the sea current.

73
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:15,980
Whatever's making it
happen isn't natural.

74
00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:18,149
How is something
like that even possible?

75
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:19,150
Come on!

76
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:20,752
You don't really expect
us to believe this crap.

77
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:22,654
Fine! See for yourselves!

78
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:24,555
Sanji? Demonstrate.

79
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:25,957
Sure!

80
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:57,455
[USOPP] What's going on here?

81
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:58,656
And again!

82
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,367
Well, would you look at that.

83
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,336
Cheeky little bastards!

84
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:40,398
[ZORO] Hm...
Nothing but ice, top to bottom.

85
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:42,400
[USOPP] If I hadn't seen it,
I wouldn't believe it!

86
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:44,469
It's almost like
they're making a path.

87
00:05:44,502 --> 00:05:46,204
And yet, they're
normal icebergs.

88
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:47,538
Very strange, indeed.

89
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:49,807
Ever since that run-in
we had with the Marines,

90
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,409
it's like there's
some sort of force

91
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:53,711
trying to guide us
to a specific place.

92
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:55,580
[FRANKY] I don't know who's
responsible for this crap,

93
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:57,482
but they've got some nerve!

94
00:05:57,515 --> 00:06:00,385
Whoever it is,
I ain't scared! Bring it!

95
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:02,153
Well, first,
before you fight them,

96
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:04,188
we have to figure out
who "they" are.

97
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:21,739
[snoring]

98
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:24,075
[PUZZLE] Vigaro! Wait!

99
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:28,579
Captain?

100
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:31,449
Vigaro... No...

101
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:33,718
Vigaro!

102
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:36,521
What's wrong?

103
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:37,622
Is something the matter?

104
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:38,856
It's Captain Puzzle!

105
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,391
He's starting to wake up!

106
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,863
[JIRO]
Captain! Thank goodness!

107
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:48,666
[JIRO]
Thank you so much!

108
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,401
You're an amazing doctor!

109
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:52,770
Sure. Glad I was
able to help him out,

110
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:56,340
but saying I'm amazing doesn't
make me happy, you jerk!

111
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:57,909
Jiro...

112
00:06:57,942 --> 00:07:00,511
What happened? Why am I here?

113
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,779
[JIRO] You don't remember?

114
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:05,216
We were attacked by some really
strong guys in the New World.

115
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:06,551
It was terrible.

116
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,825
[GUYLE]
This can't be happening...

117
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:15,693
[STANSEN] Who in the
hell were those guys?

118
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,695
[SUTTON] Hurry!
We gotta put out that fire!

119
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,763
[RACE] Do something!

120
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:20,431
[GUYLE] Why'd they attack us?

121
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,268
[RACE] Come on!
We have to see to the injured!

122
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,317
We're retreating!
Get moving, full speed!

123
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:47,658
The New World is
too much for us to handle.

124
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:49,193
We're nothing here!

125
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:50,728
Come, now...
What would people think

126
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,531
of the fearless Puzzle, The
Phoenix, talking like that?

127
00:07:53,564 --> 00:07:55,366
I'm no phoenix, dammit!

128
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,368
I'm nothing but a daydreamer!

129
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:00,238
Captain, listen.

130
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,574
We follow you because
all of us believe in you.

131
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,942
--Because you have--
--[STANSEN] It's no use, sir!

132
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:06,577
They're too fast!

133
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,215
Don't worry about it, Captain.

134
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:12,550
I'll buy us some time.

135
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,652
Stansen! I need a boat!

136
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:16,287
Vice-Captain...

137
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,421
[VIGARO] Hurry!

138
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,389
[STANSEN] Right!

139
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:20,525
[PUZZLE] Vigaro, wait!
I'm going with you!

140
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:21,592
Don't be an idiot!

141
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,562
The Captain can't abandon
his ship, you know that!

142
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:25,897
But...

143
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,667
Listen.
I believe in you, Puzzle.

144
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,304
You're the man who'll
be King of the Pirates!

145
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:35,306
Vigaro, no! Don't do this!

146
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,974
They're coming back around!

147
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,585
[SUTTON] Meteorites?

148
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:49,554
[yelling]

149
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:55,326
No!

150
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:59,730
But Vigaro couldn't
defeat them, either.

151
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:00,665
It was no contest.

152
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:03,000
They took him out
in a matter of seconds.

153
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:06,003
Still, it was those few seconds
that allowed us to escape.

154
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:08,673
We managed to break their rudder
so they couldn't catch us.

155
00:09:08,706 --> 00:09:10,975
I'm not sure how we did it,
but I'm grateful either way.

156
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,543
Vigaro saved us.

157
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:14,312
Later on, the rest
of the crew and I

158
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,347
made a solemn promise
to each other.

159
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,984
[RACE, LAGO, TROFF sobbing]

160
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,320
[JIRO] Just like Vigaro,
we must all be willing

161
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,488
to protect the
captain with our lives!

162
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:28,993
I feel the same way. Yes.

163
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,763
If it's to save Captain Puzzle,
I would gladly lay down my life.

164
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,302
[TROFF] Me, too!

165
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:39,937
[JIRO]
We'll protect the Captain!

166
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:40,771
[LAGO] No doubt!

167
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:41,706
[GUYLE] Let's do it!

168
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,507
[BASIL] We'll go back
to the New World!

169
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,376
Nothing's gonna stop us!

170
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:51,015
But Stansen
didn't agree with us.

171
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,584
[STANSEN] Vigaro went so far
as to sacrifice himself

172
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:54,685
to protect you!

173
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,954
He gave his life for you!

174
00:09:56,988 --> 00:10:00,091
I won't let that
sacrifice be in vain!

175
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:02,994
You had a fight with
bounty hunters, huh?

176
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:04,562
[JIRO]
Yeah. They were super strong.

177
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:06,731
It took everything
we had to escape.

178
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:08,532
We were completely worn out.

179
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,868
We knew if we fought them,
we'd lose, but--

180
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,436
We didn't care.

181
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,071
We weren't going to
let them steal the pride

182
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:15,806
of the Phoenix Pirates.

183
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,041
But he--

184
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,444
[JIRO] He wouldn't let us do it!

185
00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:22,413
Stansen is a coward!

186
00:10:22,446 --> 00:10:23,948
But now, since you're awake,

187
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:26,017
we can put those
awful times behind us!

188
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,420
Captain Puzzle The Phoenix
has risen from the ashes!

189
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:30,488
[JIRO] Whoa! Easy!

190
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:32,056
[CHOPPER] Don't exert yourself!
You need to rest!

191
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,357
I'm fine.

192
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,660
My body has rested enough.

193
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:38,729
Gather the crew. Get everyone
together on the deck.

194
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,974
You got it!

195
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:49,156
[RACE]
Really? The Captain's better?

196
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,026
[TROFF] You mean it?
Hahahaha, oh, yeah!

197
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:54,528
The day we've been
waiting for is finally here!

198
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:56,497
[GUYLE] The return
of the Phoenix Pirates.

199
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,832
Sucks for you, Stansen.

200
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,600
You deserve whatever you get.

201
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,836
[BASIL laughing]

202
00:11:05,606 --> 00:11:06,941
--[RACE] Captain!
--[TROFF, LAGO] Captain Puzzle!

203
00:11:06,974 --> 00:11:07,975
[SUTTON] Captain!

204
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,756
I'm sorry.
Seems I've been trouble.

205
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,657
No big deal.

206
00:11:23,691 --> 00:11:25,593
[SUTTON]
None of that matters anymore.

207
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:28,062
[TROFF] I'm so glad!
Our Captain's back!

208
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,098
C'mon. Let's get going.

209
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,836
[JIRO] Doctor Chopper! Luffy!

210
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,809
Thank you for helping us out.

211
00:11:41,842 --> 00:11:42,743
Aw, don't mention it.

212
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:44,979
I'm a doctor, so I
was just doing my job.

213
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:46,180
It's no big deal. Really!

214
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:47,048
Either way,

215
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,550
we'll definitely
repay the favor someday.

216
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,086
And I'm sure we'll be in
the New World when it happens.

217
00:11:57,158 --> 00:11:58,125
I see!

218
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,827
So you guys are headed
to the New World, too?

219
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,461
Same as us!

220
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:01,796
If that's the case, then,

221
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:03,164
when we meet,
we'll be rivals.

222
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:05,800
Hahaha! I can't wait!

223
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:06,700
Captain.

224
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:08,536
As soon as we have
a chance to regroup,

225
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,504
I'm sure we'll be
stronger than ever!

226
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:13,240
What is it?

227
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,812
What's wrong, Captain?

228
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:20,281
Listen to me.

229
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:24,251
We're--We're not going
back to the New World.

230
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:33,194
What'd you say?

231
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:34,862
Stansen's decision was right.

232
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:36,630
I stand by it.

233
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:37,865
From this point forward,

234
00:12:37,898 --> 00:12:40,568
we'll remain in the
bounty hunter crew.

235
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:43,003
[RACE] But I thought--

236
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:49,677
[BASIL] Captain Puzzle,
have you lost your mind?

237
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,012
[GUYLE] We're all ready
to lay down our lives for you!

238
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,814
Just like Vigaro did!

239
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:57,318
[PUZZLE] That's right.

240
00:12:57,351 --> 00:13:00,921
Vigaro died for me. To save me.

241
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:03,791
Listen.
I believe in you, Puzzle.

242
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:08,062
You're the man who'll
be King of the Pirates!

243
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,133
But why?

244
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,869
You're back now!
Nothing can stop us!

245
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,639
We were waiting
for you all this time!

246
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,274
For the Phoenix to
rise from the ashes!

247
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:21,142
What happened to you?

248
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,644
Where is our fearless
Captain Puzzle?

249
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,181
[PUZZLE]
Phoenix, huh?

250
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:29,250
They're nothing but a myth.

251
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:31,819
They don't exist in this world.

252
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,120
[PUZZLE] And someone like me,

253
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:36,123
who can't even protect
his friends and his crew,

254
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:38,859
has no right to set
foot in the New World.

255
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:41,128
[JIRO] Why? I don't understand.

256
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:42,163
I refuse.

257
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,098
I won't accept this, Captain.

258
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:45,166
Our flag!

259
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,734
Are you telling me
you're not even

260
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,702
going to try
to get it back?

261
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:55,142
We're not pirates anymore.

262
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:57,678
We no longer have
the right to that flag.

263
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:03,083
Dammit!

264
00:14:03,117 --> 00:14:05,753
How can you just throw away
your pride like that?

265
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:12,826
Luffy, wait!

266
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:15,729
[PUZZLE] You have my thanks.

267
00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:17,998
I'd really like to repay
you for taking care of me,

268
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:19,833
but unfortunately,
almost everything I had

269
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:22,236
was taken away from me
in the New World.

270
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:23,837
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:24,838
[PUZZLE]
I know you're determined,

272
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:27,241
but the New World
isn't to be taken lightly.

273
00:14:27,274 --> 00:14:29,710
It's dangerous out there.

274
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,879
It's fine. We can handle it.

275
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,182
See, we're really strong.

276
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,301
It's fine. We can handle it.

277
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:57,705
See, we're really strong.

278
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:01,875
[VIGARO] Don't underestimate
the New World, Captain.

279
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:04,378
[PUZZLE] Come on, Vigaro! Relax!

280
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:06,313
I'm The Phoenix, remember?

281
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:11,885
[PUZZLE]
I see. Best of luck, then.

282
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:21,195
[sobbing]

283
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:22,229
Jiro...

284
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:25,299
--[LUFFY] Let's get going.
--[CHOPPER] But we--

285
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:28,269
Their captain's
given up on their flag.

286
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,905
It's over for them.
They're no longer pirates.

287
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:34,241
[CHOPPER] I--I guess so.

288
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,918
[yelling]

289
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,804
[screaming]

290
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:06,540
Luffy! Chopper!

291
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:08,309
[NAMI]
They'll be fine on their own!

292
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,477
We need to take care
of the ship!

293
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,945
Leave it to me!

294
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,948
We're being surrounded by them!

295
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:16,383
Hard to starboard now!

296
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,118
Aye-Aye! Hard to starboard!

297
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,896
It's no use!
They're still coming!

298
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:30,097
Hard to port!

299
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:39,473
Whoaaa! Careful!

300
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,211
[ROBIN]
They're all gathering together!

301
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:46,847
[USOPP] Dammit, Sanji!
Watch where you're going!

302
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,916
Aw, crap!
The rudder's not responding!

303
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:51,085
It's not the rudder.
Take a look over there!

304
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:57,891
Since those icebergs
have blocked the current,

305
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,426
they're causing
whirlpools to form!

306
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,294
Whirlpools, too?

307
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:03,931
What the hell
is wrong with this sea?

308
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,302
[LUFFY] Whoa, it looks like--

309
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:13,540
We just found the
world's biggest snow cone!

310
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,842
We did?

311
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:18,912
[CHOPPER] It's gigantic!

312
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,581
--Yummy!
--Luffy!

313
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:23,283
This isn't the time
to be thinking about food!

314
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:26,019
Sorry, what's that?
All I heard was "food"!

315
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:30,391
Gum-Gum Gatling!

316
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:35,562
[LUFFY yelling]

317
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,997
Devil Fruit powers?

318
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,400
[LUFFY]
And now...

319
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,001
It's pointless.

320
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:43,170
...Axe!

321
00:17:57,684 --> 00:18:00,087
[LUFFY] My snow cone is sinking!

322
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:02,656
The Sunny! It disappeared!

323
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:04,525
This is the Frozen Highway.

324
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:06,393
Once a ship loses its way here,

325
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:09,088
it will never again
return to the open sea.

326
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:17,246
[ACCINO HENCHMAN 328A]
There's no doubt!

327
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,181
A 100 million Berry bounty!

328
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:20,682
The Phoenix, Puzzle!

329
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:22,751
But I thought that guy
was killed in battle.

330
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:24,219
That sneaky Stansen!

331
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:26,355
He tricked us!
He was just protecting him!

332
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:27,156
[ACCINO HENCHMAN 328B]
Straw Hat Luffy,

333
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,224
worth 300 million,
is there, too.

334
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:31,226
Making a total of 400 million.

335
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,361
[ACCINO HENCHMAN 328A]
Not a bad haul!

336
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:35,430
We need to report
this to Brindo ASAP!

337
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:38,734
Hahaha! So The Phoenix
Captain Puzzle is alive.

338
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,569
I can't believe
those pitiful pirates

339
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:43,572
thought they could actually pull
one over on the Accino family.

340
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:45,507
Why, the nerve of those people!

341
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,608
[BRINDO] My brothers!

342
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:49,344
It seems our present
for Papa will be even better!

343
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,113
For now, I will
leave this to you.

344
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:52,514
I shall return shortly.

345
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,715
[SANJI] I can't believe you!

346
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:56,752
Sneaking a peek at Nami's
butt during all the commotion!

347
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:58,320
[FRANKY] You switched
over to the paddles.

348
00:18:58,353 --> 00:18:59,321
Is something wrong?

349
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:01,256
Franky!
Where have you been?

350
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,791
[FRANKY] I was refilling
our supply of cola

351
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,459
in the energy room.

352
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:06,228
I got a feelin', if I'm right,

353
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:08,263
it'll definitely
come in handy soon.

354
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:09,431
That's great and all,

355
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:11,633
but with all these moving
icebergs, it doesn't matter.

356
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:12,601
We're stuck here!

357
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:14,436
We're gonna be trapped
in this stupid place

358
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:15,704
for the rest of our lives!

359
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,040
Don't worry.
We'll figure it out soon.

360
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,141
[FRANKY] Come on!

361
00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:21,076
You make it sound like those
icebergs are a big deal!

362
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:22,544
What are you talking about?

363
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,446
We just need to
get outta here, right?

364
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:26,048
It doesn't matter how.

365
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:33,388
Oh, yeah!

366
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:49,671
Looks like we
finally found you!

367
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:52,641
Going somewhere?

368
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:54,443
Don't you know
that when a ship is lost

369
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:56,845
on the Frozen Highway,
it's destined to wander

370
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:58,447
for all eternity?

371
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,148
Just give up already!

372
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:02,084
Couldn't have
said it better myself.

373
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,220
Indeed! Indeed! Indeed!

374
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:07,256
You'll never get away from us!

375
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:11,660
That's rather tasteless.

376
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:13,562
[SANJI] I can't believe
such a beautiful woman

377
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:15,397
is with that man-troll!

378
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:17,699
Hey! You!

379
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,402
I challenge you
to a duel for her honor!

380
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:22,838
Unfortunately, we can't
stick around for games,

381
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:24,172
right, Franky?

382
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:25,207
[FRANKY]
Mm-hmm.

383
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,143
Excuse us, but I'm
afraid we'll be leaving now.

384
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:30,412
Have you gone daft?
I already told you,

385
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:32,881
escaping from the Frozen
Highway is impossible.

386
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:35,684
Understand? Impossible!

387
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:38,687
Right! Couldn't
have said it better!

388
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,157
Indeed! Indeed! Indeed!

389
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,426
You'll never get away from us!

390
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:49,665
Whenever you're ready, Franky!

391
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:52,134
Aye-Aye! Leave it to me!

392
00:20:57,906 --> 00:21:00,409
[FRANKY] Coup de...

393
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,281
[FRANKY] ...Burst!

394
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,853
[confused yelling]

395
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,260
No! But how? It's flying!

396
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:20,228
Well... Look at that.

397
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:21,863
[SALCHOW yelling in pain]

398
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:23,632
[CAMPACINO]
What's wrong, Salchow?

399
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:24,499
[SALCHOW] The ship, it--

400
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,269
It flew through the sky!
They got away!

401
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:29,371
[CAMPACINO] What insane
drivel are you babbling about?

402
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:30,939
--[SALCHOW] But I swear I--
--[ARBELL] Give me that thing!

403
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:32,741
[ARBELL]
It's true, brother!

404
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:35,877
They flew away!
I saw it with my own two eyes!

405
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,513
[CAMPACINO] Papa.

406
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,716
Something unfortunate
has happened.

407
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:46,588
They won't leave
without their flag.

408
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:47,589
[CAMPACINO] Of course!

409
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:49,925
What a devious idea, Papa!

410
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,363
We are to steal
their flag. Understand?

411
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,931
Perfectly, my honey!

412
00:21:55,964 --> 00:21:58,567
[kissing noises]

413
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:01,303
[SALCHOW] Oh, Lil!

414
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:03,338
Might I ask a favor of you
to help us catch them?

415
00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:04,206
I don't wanna.

416
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,408
What? I mean...
I was just hoping that--

417
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:07,609
I'll handle this.

418
00:22:07,642 --> 00:22:10,245
Lil, dear.
It's not just us asking.

419
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:11,446
Didn't you hear?

420
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,682
It's a request
from our beloved Papa.

421
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:20,889
Go! Flying fish!

422
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:34,936
[FLYING FISH cooing]

423
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,638
What a strange fish.

424
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:41,743
[FLYING FISH cooing]

425
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,785
[USOPP] I can finally relax!

426
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:51,753
I could sure get used to this!

427
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:55,590
Blue sky, white clouds,
and a big beautiful sun

428
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,960
shimmering behind
a pirate fla--fla--

429
00:22:58,994 --> 00:23:00,629
What the hell?

430
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:02,431
[NAMI] Our flag! It's gone!

431
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,734
Come to think of it,
Zoro's gone, too.

432
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:10,839
[ZORO] I can't believe them!

433
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:12,641
They got lost again!

434
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:14,242
Buncha idiots.

435
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,582
[ZORO]
Brrr! I'm not cold!

436
00:23:20,615 --> 00:23:21,883
And I'm not lost, either!

437
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,351
If the icebergs and the Sunny

438
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:25,454
can move around as
they please, why can't I?

439
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,521
So what if the rest of the crew

440
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:29,524
is eating something
nice and warm without me...

441
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:31,827
[ZORO sneezes]

442
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,595
What's up with
that weird building?

443
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:35,330
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

444
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:36,665
The Assassins Attack!

445
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:38,934
The Great Battle on Ice Begins!

446
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:41,536
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
