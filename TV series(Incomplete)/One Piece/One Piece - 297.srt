1
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,825
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:41,695
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:45,199
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:50,170
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,373
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,474
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,044
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,313
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,549
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,786
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,189
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:10,791
You'd have to be a fool

13
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:13,793
to disregard a
navigator's forecast.

14
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,096
Now.

15
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,032
[KALIFA]
Not again.

16
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,006
Thunder Lance Tempo!

17
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,613
You might be remarkably strong,

18
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,148
but I can predict the weather,

19
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,749
and I'm never wrong.

20
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,526
[NAMI]
My friends are waiting for me.

21
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,761
I'll be taking your key now.

22
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,369
Back off, Chopper, it's us!

23
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,671
Please, Chopper, don't kill me!

24
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,175
How do we know that
thing is really Chopper?

25
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,043
Why the hell doesn't
he recognize us?

26
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,246
I've got no idea,
but that is Chopper!

27
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,647
Who else has antlers
and wears a hat like that?

28
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,650
[FRANKY]
Step aside, you guys!

29
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,318
[ZORO]
It's you!

30
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,253
Hey, hold it!

31
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,287
What do you think you're doing,

32
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,222
the deer monster is on our side!

33
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,156
I know what I'm doing.

34
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,557
Shut up and move.

35
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,764
[FRANKY] This is the only way
there is to deal with him.

36
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,166
Power holders have one weakness.

37
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,402
I'll knock him into the sea.

38
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,671
Sorry, pal, but this is
for your own good.

39
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,142
Coupe de--

40
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,644
Vent!

41
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,548
That's the last straw, Franky-

42
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,117
you're not gonna
get away with this!

43
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,752
Nobody treats
my friends that way!

44
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,553
[NAMI]
It's okay, guys.

45
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,122
We came up with
this plan together.

46
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,569
You finally managed to
free yourselves, huh?

47
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,471
[ZORO] You better stop
laughing and start running.

48
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,408
You blew your only
chance to kill me.

49
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,343
And you're not getting another.

50
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,612
It's my turn and I'm
taking you all down.

51
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,615
The entire World Government.

52
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,020
[LUFFY]

53
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,128
[screams and panicked shouting]

54
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,096
[SOLDIERS]
Evacuate Enies Lobby!

55
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,064
They're gonna start shooting!

56
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,302
[SOLDIER] The Buster Call's
gonna wipe us out

57
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,070
along with the pirates!

58
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,046
You get back here, Nico Robin!

59
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,183
Even if you make it
out of this tunnel,

60
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,585
all you'll find are
your friends' corpses!

61
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,490
I've had enough
of this nonsense.

62
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,361
Let's teach her
a lesson, Funkfreed.

63
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,333
[ROBIN]
Luffy is just up ahead!

64
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,004
But don't kill her, understood?

65
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:16,243
Ivory Dart!

66
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,062
Idiot! You will never escape!

67
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,697
Don't underestimate me!

68
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,366
Now, come along, you wench.

69
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,668
Through the gate of dreams.

70
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,409
He's finally back to normal.

71
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,118
Doesn't look like he's dead.

72
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:59,153
This is weird.

73
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,020
Not even his friends knew how

74
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:02,689
to handle this guy
after he changed.

75
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,259
Do you wanna get
Nico Robin back or not?

76
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,661
I do! Robin!

77
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,396
Well. Whatever.

78
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,766
At least you managed to
take out one of the CP9 guys.

79
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,269
Kinda lame how you turned

80
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,071
into that giant thing
and tried to kill me,

81
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,138
but if your friends are willing

82
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:21,741
to stand up for you,
then I won't hold a grudge.

83
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,412
We'd better get moving.

84
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,382
Now that I think about it,

85
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,282
even if we hurry,
how do we get to

86
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:32,719
the Gates of Justice
without a bridge?

87
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,357
We'll show you the way!

88
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,725
Meow! Meow!

89
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:38,792
It's you guys!

90
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,527
Look! We found Franky!

91
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,362
Meow! Meow! Meow!

92
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:43,797
[FRANKY]
Wait.

93
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,799
You found a tunnel that
leads to the Gates of Justice?

94
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:47,835
Sure did!

95
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,503
And we'll take you right
through, if you like!

96
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:50,804
Meow! Meow!

97
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,273
I showed Granny!

98
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,340
She's down there now!

99
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:54,742
All right then,
let's get moving!

100
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:55,809
I'll fill you in on the plan

101
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,611
after we meet up
with the old lady.

102
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,379
Got it?

103
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,146
Roger!

104
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,347
Meow!

105
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,717
He's unconscious.

106
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,486
But I'm pretty sure
he's gonna be okay.

107
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:10,624
Stop that, you old hag!

108
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,259
And give that bottle a break!

109
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,262
Oh, yeah. No time to waste.

110
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,064
I need to get these
keys to Nico Robin

111
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,199
before they take
her through that gate!

112
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,602
You guys grab the
deer and follow me!

113
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,570
All right?

114
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:23,470
Yep!

115
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,806
Okay! Good luck, Franky!

116
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,041
Meow! Meow!

117
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,413
We don't have a choice.

118
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,448
That's the only way
we can stop Chopper.

119
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,116
Oh, and here, take these.

120
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,251
Once we get him back to normal,

121
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,686
you'll need to get
the number three

122
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,087
and four keys to Robin.

123
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,388
One of them should be able

124
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,523
to unlock her restraints.

125
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,958
Soon as you get the cuffs off,

126
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,628
call me on this transponder
snail I swiped from blondie.

127
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:48,596
Right.

128
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:51,732
Meanwhile, I'll take this key

129
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,435
and get the cuffs off Zoro and
Nose-King.

130
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,470
Seems like a solid plan, but
what do we do after that?

131
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,072
Even if we're able
to free everyone

132
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,406
and rescue Nico Robin,

133
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,141
that drawbridge
is still locked up.

134
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:02,543
We'll be running
around this damn tower

135
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,511
with no way to get
back to Enies Lobby.

136
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,579
We're stuck here.

137
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:06,814
Yeah.

138
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:09,316
There's the Buster Call
to deal with, too.

139
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,751
If we tried going back
the way we came,

140
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,286
we'd get blown to bits.

141
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,320
So?

142
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,254
What do you think?

143
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,323
The choice is pretty
clear now, isn't it?

144
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,227
A waterfall of death behind us;

145
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,528
a mysterious path ahead.

146
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,663
Which way would you go?

147
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,498
The mysterious
path ahead, of course.

148
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,399
Exactly.

149
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,533
So once we've freed everyone

150
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,635
and we're done in this tower,

151
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,536
we'll meet at the
Gates of Justice.

152
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,239
After that, just
leave everything--

153
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,140
[FRANKY]
To you?

154
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,041
To luck!

155
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,675
Aw, that's just great!

156
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:43,984
[KAKU]
Come on.

157
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,319
We've wasted quite
a bit of time here.

158
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,689
[NAMI]
Damn right, you have!

159
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:49,790
I can't believe you two!

160
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,059
How can you be screwing
around at a time like this?

161
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:52,926
[USOPP and ZORO]
Because!

162
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,795
He wouldn't stop
acting like an idiot!

163
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,363
You're both acting like idiots!

164
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,365
Hurry up and get those keys!

165
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,133
Tempest Kick.

166
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,303
Straight Line!

167
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,374
[USOPP] Just as I instructed!
Nice going, Zoro!

168
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,809
Fight, Zoro!

169
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,478
You guys fight too, dammit!

170
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,750
That long neck of yours,

171
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,386
sure looks like a
weak spot to me.

172
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,521
Sorry, but that's
where you're wrong.

173
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,226
The abilities
I've gained allow me

174
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,362
to freely control
my neck with ease.

175
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,130
Plus, I have a new attack.

176
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,432
Nose Pistol!

177
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,409
[USOPP] Whoa! We're all
the way over here

178
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,744
and I can still
feel the shockwave!

179
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,225
A square-shaped hole?

180
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,560
That's an impressive nose!

181
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,328
Even more so than Sniper-ssop's!

182
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,497
Sniper-ssop? What the hell?

183
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,299
And lay off the nose, got it?

184
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,233
[JABRA]
At any rate.

185
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,701
Looks like Kaku's
really getting the hang

186
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,137
of using his
Devil Fruit abilities.

187
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,771
Fast learner.

188
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,041
Alright, wolf!

189
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,110
I'm the one you
gotta deal with now!

190
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:17,144
So bring it on!

191
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,080
Don't get so worked up.

192
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,014
Listen.

193
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,384
You guys wanna save
your friend, right?

194
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,251
Yeah, that's right!

195
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:26,219
And I'm gonna take
your key to do it!

196
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,460
Then go save her
while you still can.

197
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,628
[USOPP]
What?

198
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:35,529
You heard me.

199
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,765
Take that key and
go save your friend.

200
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,501
I don't get it. Why?

201
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,202
I don't like killing people.

202
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,772
The sight of bloodshed
makes me sick to my stomach.

203
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:48,108
I'm a pacifist.

204
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,644
Oh. Okay, then.

205
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:54,748
I'll just--Take
this key and, uh--

206
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,783
No! Look out!

207
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,253
Ten Finger Pistol!

208
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:06,160
Never let your guard down!

209
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,761
I'm a wolf, understand?

210
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,764
I outsmart my prey
and then I eat it!

211
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,545
Usopp!

212
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,679
[USOPP]
Dammit!

213
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:29,149
What am I-- What am I doing?

214
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,754
That mask can't
hide your stupidity!

215
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,589
Why don't you just
run around screaming

216
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,291
and crying like you did earlier?

217
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,059
You were great at that!

218
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,094
Don't you make fun of me!

219
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,296
Huh?

220
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,500
[USOPP] We don't have
time for crap like this.

221
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,804
New weapon, Kabuto!

222
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,573
Special Attack Sunflower Star!

223
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,278
Oh.

224
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:09,322
Wow. A fireworks show.

225
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,825
[NAMI]
No! Usopp!

226
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,059
[JABRA]
Moon Walk!

227
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,738
Leave him alone!

228
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:41,789
[JABRA]
Just like I promised.

229
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,223
I'll kill you quickly.

230
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,725
There won't be any pain.

231
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,093
It's too bad, really.

232
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,261
You were so much better off

233
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,195
when you were connected

234
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,364
to that green-haired
shepherd over there.

235
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,699
But since this little lamb

236
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:53,267
has wandered off on his own,

237
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,402
things are a bit different.

238
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,137
Now you're nothing
but a tasty morsel

239
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,239
for the big, scary wolf.

240
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,510
This is the end!

241
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,248
Let him go! Damn wolf!

242
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,482
Please, don't kill him!

243
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,650
Keep your key! We don't need it!

244
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,753
You stupid girl!

245
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,388
You're gonna be
the next one to die!

246
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:19,159
[KAKU]
Tempest Kick!

247
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:21,629
Oh, no!

248
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,130
And now it's over!

249
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,571
[ZORO and NAMI]
Usopp!

250
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,697
Who the hell are you?

251
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,786
I'm the hunter.

252
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,574
[JABRA]
And now it's over!

253
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,578
[ZORO and NAMI]
Usopp!

254
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,372
It's Sanji!

255
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:15,209
Sanji.

256
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,645
How did you get your
body back to normal?

257
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:19,046
[SANJI]
Some big bathtub fell

258
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,081
from the sky and
smashed to pieces.

259
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,216
Water went everywhere.

260
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:23,583
It must've broke the spell.

261
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,662
But more importantly, Nami.

262
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:39,432
Did you just fall in love
with me all over again?

263
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,206
I wish that bathtub had
dropped right on your head.

264
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:53,580
[NAMI]
Nose-ssop!

265
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,282
[USOPP] Now it's to the
point where not even

266
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:58,552
Sniper or King
is in my name, huh?

267
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:07,794
I'm-- I'm sorry, Sanji. I--

268
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:12,599
I tried. But I couldn't--

269
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,602
You're alive,
that's what matters.

270
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:16,503
Everyone has things
that they can do

271
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,338
and things that they can't.

272
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,074
Yeah, but--

273
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,312
Both of you.

274
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,680
Take a look outside.

275
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,151
Oh, no.

276
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,504
It's The Gates of Justice.

277
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,305
They're starting to open!

278
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,109
Robin.

279
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:03,550
[SANJI]
If those gates open up

280
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,185
and Robin goes through them,

281
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,154
we won't have any
way to follow her.

282
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,323
She'll cross waters
infested with Sea Kings,

283
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,459
and beyond that is either
the undersea prison

284
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,328
or Navy Headquarters.

285
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,496
Everywhere on the other side

286
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,731
of those gates is
beyond our reach.

287
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,400
We'll lose her forever.

288
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,435
[NAMI] But I thought
Luffy would have caught up

289
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,436
to her by now.

290
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:34,782
[LUFFY]
Dammit! I can't get through!

291
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:37,150
Robin's waiting for me!

292
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,553
Just give it up.

293
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,655
You'll never see
your friend again.

294
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:45,258
This is as far as
you're going to get.

295
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:07,548
Now Gum-Gum Gatling!

296
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:09,349
[LUCCI]
That isn't going to work on me.

297
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:28,435
Come on!

298
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:32,139
I said come!

299
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,207
We're going to the bridge!

300
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,281
Am I gonna make it in time?

301
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:42,416
I sure hope either this
number three or four key

302
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:45,352
will unlock those
damn handcuffs.

303
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,722
But no matter what,
I gotta stop them!

304
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:54,061
Go this way. Go this way.
Go this way. Go this way.

305
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:55,396
[KOKORO]
Come on, Chimney! Hurry up!

306
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:58,198
This tower's in
the line of fire, too.

307
00:19:58,632 --> 00:19:59,800
Hold on, Granny!

308
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,503
If I don't show 'em the way,
everybody's gonna get lost!

309
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,271
Meow! Meow!

310
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,754
[KAKU] In hindsight, picking
me as your opponent

311
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,257
wasn't the best idea,
now was it?

312
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,391
From the looks of it,

313
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:27,294
I think you would have
been better off fighting Jabra.

314
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:33,500
When you see 'em, I want you

315
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:37,538
to pass on a message for me.

316
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:41,308
"You're all fired".

317
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,709
You got it.

318
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:44,745
No.

319
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:46,513
I'm happy that it's you.

320
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:49,382
Feeling a little cocky, are we?

321
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,330
[SOLDIERS]
Run! Hurry!

322
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:06,767
Hey! Let us on!

323
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,336
Impossible! This train is full!

324
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:12,372
You'll have to find another way!

325
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,609
[ZAMBAI]
You bastard!

326
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,378
I thought you were
just playing it cool!

327
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:18,545
You were pretending
to be tied up

328
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,247
with your own rope
the whole time?

329
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,650
Yeah. Was just
waiting for a chance.

330
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:24,084
"Waiting for a chance"?

331
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,353
This whole island's
gonna go up in flames!

332
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,088
We just got left behind!

333
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,189
There's no way out!

334
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:30,624
Well, look at it this way:

335
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:31,425
we were able to get away

336
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,527
from the Marines,
now weren't we?

337
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,463
We don't have time for
this kinda crap, Galley-La!

338
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:39,133
They said something
about a "Buster Call".

339
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,734
And considering how
panicky they got.

340
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,470
I'd say we don't have much time.

341
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,139
What about Big Bro?

342
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:46,507
What about the Straw Hats?

343
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,175
Those guys are all unstoppable!

344
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,543
There's no need
to worry about them!

345
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:50,410
They'll be fine!

346
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:53,180
We need to hurry
and get off this island!

347
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:55,515
Yeah!

348
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:00,187
Ten battleships just departed!

349
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,756
They set sail towards
the island of Enies Lobby!

350
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:15,069
This is the worst
situation I can imagine.

351
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:16,437
But in every situation,

352
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,406
even one as bad as this,
there's always a chance.

353
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:24,144
Sanji.

354
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,215
Leave this guy's key to me.

355
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:32,753
Changing my opponent, huh?

356
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:35,055
Doesn't matter to me.

357
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,191
For now, I'm gonna stay here

358
00:22:37,224 --> 00:22:39,260
and do what you can't do.

359
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:42,830
You need to do what I can't do!

360
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,732
[USOPP]
Huh?

361
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:48,135
[SANJI]
Think carefully.

362
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:50,437
Read the situation.

363
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,371
As long as we have you,

364
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:54,341
there's still a chance
we can save Robin!

365
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,009
You hear me, Usopp?

366
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:00,547
I want to live!

367
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,685
[USOPP]
What I can do?

368
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:15,262
[JABRA] Don't waste all of
your precious time pitying

369
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:17,531
that hopeless fool of a woman
when you should be busy

370
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:20,434
trying to think of a way
to get out of here alive.

371
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:22,369
[SANJI]
Hey! You watch your mouth!

372
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:26,140
[SANJI]
You don't want to see me mad.

373
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:28,409
I tend to overheat when I'm mad.

374
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:29,710
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

375
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,111
"Fiery Kicks!

376
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,447
Sanji's Full Course
of Foot Techniques!"

377
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,016
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
