Not here... Ah!

176
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,228
I've got to live...

177
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,064

find the All Blue!

I recommend we
withdraw, immediately!

You're lucky to
be alive, you know.

You!

[ZEFF]
Moving isn't a good idea.

[SANJI gasps]

215
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,130

What about the ships?

[ZEFF]
Who knows?

217
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,866
It was terrible storm.

218
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,803
Our ships were most
likely destroyed.

219
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,771
Seems we're the
only survivors.

220
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,940
Washed ashore on
a desolate rock,

221
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,811
without so much as a
coconut tree to give us food.

222
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,913
Sure, there are fish in the sea,

223
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,916
but the rock has been curved
by the waves in such a manner

224
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,918
that we wouldn't be
able to climb back up,

225
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,586
if we ever went down.

226
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,921
Sad, isn't it?

227
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,123
This is all your fault, Old Man!

228
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,791
I hope you die!

229
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,227
[ZEFF] You can whine all
you want, it won't help.

230
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,462
If nobody comes,

231
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,598
we'll just dry up and become
two more skeletons in the sea.

232
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,467
Skeletons?

233
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,835
Really?

234
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,071
[ZEFF] That bag there...
It's your share of it.

235
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,106
Ah!

236
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,909
[ZEFF] It's some of the
food that washed up.

237
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,112
Should be about five days worth.

238
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,848
It's not much, but it's
better than nothin'.

239
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,650
If you ration it out,
it'll last longer,

240
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,652

both cooks, huh?

Is that bag your
share of the food?!

244
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,260
You got way more than me!

00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:44,130

247

[ZEFF]
Of course I get more food...

248
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,838
I'm a grown man, so I
need more to survive

249
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,840
than a runt like you.

250
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,644
You should be grateful that
I'm sharing any of it with you.

251
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:02,681
Don't expect any pity
from me, you little brat!

254
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,695
[ZEFF] Get to the other side of
this rock and watch for ships.

255
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,898
Let me know as
soon as you see one.

256
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,701
Until then, don't bother talkin'
to me or movin' from your post.

257
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,138
That'll just waste energy,
and we can't afford that.

258
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,706
Good luck.

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,041
Screw you, gramps.

260
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,211
I'm not saying anything
if I see a ship.

261
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,681
I'll be fine. I have five
whole days worth of food.

262
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,083
We'll definitely see a ship
or two before I run out.

263
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,351
I'm sure of it.

264
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,755
Just to be extra safe, I'll
divide it up for twenty days.

265
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,090
That's more than enough
time to get rescued.

266
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,828
I guess all I gotta
do now is sit and wait.

267
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,664
Easy! I'll make it
through this thing...

the leftovers of strangers.

You should just let me
throw that stuff away.

have some... huh?

I did.
