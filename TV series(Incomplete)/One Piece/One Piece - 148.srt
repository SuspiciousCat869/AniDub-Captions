Now, about this
strange nightfall.

53
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:53,631

This cloud is called
a "cumuloregalis."

63
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,982
It forms high in the sky.

64
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,652
It has no internal air currents
and never turns to rain.

65
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,070
No light can reach the ground,

66
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,240
and a sunny afternoon
turns black as pitch.

67
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,659
It's like some
giant hand reached up

68
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,162

sun like it was a candle.

69

There's only one way to
get there: the Knock‐Up Stream.

It shoots straight up in the
air, so it could theoretically

up falling back into the ocean

00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,905
and getting smashed into pieces?

103
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,282
Usually, that's true,

104
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,742
unless you can get
the timing just right.

105
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,119
It's one thing to
sit here all comfy

106
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,330
and talk about riding
the Knock‐Up Stream.

107
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,957
But if you think this
trip is gonna be

108
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,250
some kind of pleasure cruise,

109
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,168

very rude awakening.

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,671
[CHOPPER]
Oh...

111
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,674
[CRICKET] The Knock‐Up Stream is
as dangerous as any hurricane.

112
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,302
It should be avoided
at all costs!

113
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,180
But how exactly can
a current of water rise up

114
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,932
in the air in the first place?

115
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,183
Come on.

I've heard a lot of
different explanations

119
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,693
for the Knock‐Up Stream,
but there's only been one

120
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,945
that's made any sense
to me, though so far

121
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,365
no one has been stupid
enough to try and confirm it.

122
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,909
It's like this.

123
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,122
[CRICKET]
Deep below the ocean floor

124
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,875
there are large cavities
filled with air.

125
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,294
Cool seawater seeps
into these air pockets

126
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,214
and geothermal energy heats
it until it becomes steam.

127
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,425
Over time, the pressure builds.

128
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,344
And when it finally
becomes too great,

129
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,637
there's a tremendous explosion.

130
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,890
This explosion hurls
the water into the air

131
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,060
and creates a
current to the sky!

132
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,312
The effect lasts
for about one minute.

133
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,023
Connecting the ocean
to the sky like a bridge.

134
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:57,982
One minute?

135
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,193
Do you realize how
enormous an explosion

136
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,736
like that would have to be?

137
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,988
The explosions occur in
widely different locations

138
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,157
about five times a month.

139
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,786
We'd be blown into fish food
if we tried that, old man!

140
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,954
[CRICKET] Anyway, you can't
really explain something

141
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,123
like this with
words and theories.

142
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,334
It's one of the great
mysteries of creation.

143
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,753
So... So then, we gotta
ride this current

144
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,296
that shows up five times
a month into the air

145
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,340
to reach some island in the sky

146
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,884
and just hope
it's waiting for us?

147
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,387
[CRICKET] I'd say that
sums it up pretty well.

148
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,848
And if you miss you fall back
down, slam into the ocean,

149
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,351
and get blown into fish food.

150
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,228
Just like you said.

151
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,691
[USOPP] Okay! So we're gonna
forget about sky island, right?

152
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,485

00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,821

it's completely insane,

157
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,456

158
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,958
How can you say it'll be okay?

159

Think about it for a second!

160
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,378
And what about
the poor Going Merry?

161
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,047
Did you even stop to
consider the shape she's in?

162
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,049
The way she's suffering?

163
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,801
There's no way you can
expect her to stand up

164
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,970
to a disaster like
this in her condition!

165
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,180
He's absolutely right;
she's worthless.

166

Even brand new that wreck
wouldn't stand a chance.

167

00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,061
[CRICKET]
Speed, weight, strength.

169
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,980
The explosion would blow
that ship to pieces

170
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,066
before it had a
chance to get airborne.

171
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,317
Yeah.

172

173
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,528
It's hopeless.

174
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,156
But don't worry, I think
I can help you out there.

175
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,284
I'll have Masira and Shojo do
a complete refit of your ship.

176
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,202
I'll also have them
reinforce the superstructure

177
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,454
to withstand the strain.

178
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,329
You bet!

179
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,373
Don't worry, guys,
we're all over it!

180
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,958
[LUFFY]
Thanks, fellas!

181
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,420
[USOPP, NAMI]
Yeah, thanks a lot.

182
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,172
Have you really
thought about this?

183
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,423
[LUFFY]
What?

184
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,383
[NAMI] Well, about‐‐ Oh, yeah,
how about the fact that at most,

185
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,844
we can only stay one
more day on this island,

186
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,345
or did that slip your mind?

187
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,555
After that the
Log Pose will lock

188
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,142
onto the next island's location,
and we'll have to move on.

189
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,144
[USOPP]
That's right! That's right!

190
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,270
We gotta move on!

191
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,396
Hey, old man!

192
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,190
I realize you're not
a fortune teller

193
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,025
and you probably don't
have the vaguest idea,

194
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,818
but how many days will
it be until the next time

195
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,945
the Knock‐Up Stream lines up
with the cumuloregalis,

196
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,073
or better yet, how may weeks, or
months, or years, or centuries?

197
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,533
Now, take your time,
I'm in no hurry.

198
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,243
Can I lend you an abacus?

199
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,786
It'll be at around
noon tomorrow,

200
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,497
so you better get ready.

201
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,415
Wait a minute,
you mean we can make it?

202
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,500
Afraid so.

203
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,044
If you're scared, then don't go.

204
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,838
[USOPP]
You're lying!

205
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,714
[CRICKET]
Hmm?

206
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,090
There's something
fishy about this!

207
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,134
We've known you
less than 24 hours!

208
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,053
Why are you being so helpful?

209
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,221
And what's more?

210
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,847
Now, hold on, Usopp!

211
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,474
You hold on 'til I finish!

212
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,976
This sky island,
this legendary place

213
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,145
we don't even know the location
of is just gonna show up

214
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,148
out of the blue
at noon tomorrow?

215
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,316
And to help us get there.

216
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,153
You're gonna rebuild and
reinforce our ship for nothing?

217
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,156
When something looks too good
to be true, it probably is!

218
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,157
The infamous Liar Noland

219
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,618
is your great‐great
grand whatever, right?

220
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,162
So how do we know
we can trust you?

221
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,498
[sighs]

222
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,457
Hey, old man!

223
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,502
Soup's on, come
and get it while it's hot!

224
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,336
Move it!

225
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,547
Nami, din‐‐

226
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,174
[CRICKET]
Hmm...

227
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,551
Wha‐What is it?

228
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,219
You wanna fight me?

229
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,138
Masira said whenever
the "midday night" occurs

230
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,933
in this area,
a cumuloregalis cloud appears

231
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,228
in the southern
sky the next day.

232
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,064
Based on its usual cycle
of five appearances a month

233
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,524
I'm guessing the
Knock‐Up Stream

234
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,193
will also erupt
tomorrow at midday.

235
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,487
That will probably
also be to the south.

236
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,239
I can't be 100 percent certain,

237
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,867
but there's a good chance
the two events will coincide.

238
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,086
[CRICKET] I'm proud to have met
a bunch of brave fools like you.

239
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,629
You're true pirates.

240
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,258
Now then,
let's go inside and eat.

241
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,887
Tonight, I want you to call
my home your home, my friends.

242
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,515
[giggles]

243
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,225
Come on, Usopp. It's chow time!

244
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,935
Yeah, come on you guys!

245
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,229
[SANJI]
Chopper, go get Robin!

246
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,064
[CHOPPER]
You bet!

247
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,484
It looks like we're
going to this sky island,

248
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,278
whether we're ready or not.

249
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,572
Well let's just hope
our luck continues to hold.

250
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,075
Nami, do you think
I'm a spineless little coward?

251
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,077
You forgot to mention "idiot."

252
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,579
And I know how you feel.

253
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,249
Now why not go apologize?

254
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,960
[USOPP]
I'm sorry, Old‐timer!

255
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:28,961
[CRICKET]
What are you doing?

256
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,588
Don't wipe that nose on me!

257
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,089
It's disgusting!

258
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,215
Idiot!

259
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,553
[laughter]

260
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,679
[LUFFY]
Come over here, buddy.

261
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,306
Dance with me.

262
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,141
Oh, yeah, keep it coming.

263
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,601
That really hits the old spot!

264
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,686
Eat up, everyone,
I'm just getting started.

265
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,313
There's plenty more on the way!

266
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,814
[USOPP]
Here!

267
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,191
Gotcha, ape face!

268
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,025
Oh, yeah!

269
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,444
It was hot sauce!

270
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,528
[MASIRA]
Come here you squirrely,

271
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,072
goggle eyed, little freak!

272
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:56,822
Hey, good‐looking!

273
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,823
You wanna sit next to me?

274
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,033
Whoa, shift down
a gear, old man,

275
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,328
you're about a hundred years
too old to be hitting on Nami!

276
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,214
The skull's right eye.

277
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,216
That's where I saw the gold.

278
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,509
[NAMI]
Gold?

279
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,639
[CRICKET]
Those words, smeared with tears,

280
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,142
are the last ones Noland
wrote in his log book.

281
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,729
The skull's right eye,
that's where I saw the gold.

282
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,441
That very same day,
Noland was executed.

283
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,860
I still don't know
what he meant by that.

284
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,737
Does it refer
to the name of a city,

285
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,116
or some landmark that used
to exist on the island?

286
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,661
Or is it just a poetic allusion
to his own impending death?

287
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,747
The blank pages that
follow give us no clue.

288
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,167
And that's the reason
we continue to dive

289
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,794
to the bottom of the sea!

290
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,421
We dream!

291
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,756
Hooray for us!

292
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,636
We're gonna go flying! Ha!

293
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,264
[USOPP] Not if you keep
eating like that, we won't!

294
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,100
[laughter]

295
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,103
[EDDY]
It's getting pretty dark,

296
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,272
but I can make out
the shoreline.

297
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,189
It's clear.

298
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,608
[BELLAMY]
Drop anchor and prepare to land.

299
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:19,405
Golden treasure shouldn't be
wasted on starry‐eyed dreamers.

300
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,258
[CRICKET]
"Log entry for May 21st, 1122.

301
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,428
Today I arrived on Jaya.

302
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,597
Shortly after making landfall,
we were startled

303
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,391
by the peculiar cries of
some strange bird from deep

304
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,435
in the forest,
as well as the tolling

305
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,313
of what seemed to
be an enormous bell.

306
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,357
The ringing of that golden bell
resounded far and wide,

307
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,526
as if announcing the
presence of some great

308
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,945
and prosperous city of the past.

309
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,822
It's fleeting echoes
the only reminder

310
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,826
that this land was once home
to a mighty civilization."

311
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,706
No land! No land!

312
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,999
[CRICKET]
"In our pride and our arrogance,

313
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,169
we thought we had seen and heard
everything in our short lives,

314
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,506
but the sound of that bell
tolling left us all speechless.

315
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,840
It was as if
the clang of that bell

316
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,343
had struck us all
dumb with wonder!"

317
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,928
[roars]

318
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,970
[screams]

319
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,765
Attaway, Noland!

320
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,725
I just love stories
with bells in them,

321
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,935
especially gold ones!

322
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,019
Hey, Old‐timer, it sounds like

323
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,356
you just might be little
fond of Noland after all!

324
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,483
[CRICKET]
Look at this!

325
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,694
[NAMI]
Wow! A golden bell!

326
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,656
Huh. Doesn't seem
too enormous to me.

327
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,199
None of these is the one Noland

328
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,867
was writing about
in his logbook.

329
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,744
These are bell‐shaped
golden ingots we found

330
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,579
on the ocean
floor during a dive.

331
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,413
Golden ingots?

332
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,958
The city of gold.
Hah! It is real!

333
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,876
[SHOJO]
It's still not proof, though.

334
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,504
You could find golden relics
like that lying around

335
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,589
in any old ruin in
this part of the world.

336
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,715
[ROBIN] Maybe so,
but it does suggest

337
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,010
there was a civilization
here some time in the past.

338
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,470
Ingots are made to divide gold

339
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,514
into standardized
units of weight.

340
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,475
And that would indicate an
advanced trading society.

341
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,561
Right, and you remember
that peculiar bird call

342
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,271
he said they heard
when they landed?

343
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,814
Show it to them!

344
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,608
There's more gold?

345
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,652
Just look at the size of it!

346
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,695
[CRICKET]
That's the last of them.

347
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,655
[NAMI]
It's gorgeous!

348
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,615
Golden bells and birds, huh?

349
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,825
Do you think
they might be symbols

350
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,994
of some ancient
Jayan civilization?

351
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,746
[exhales] I really couldn't say
for certain, but I'm pretty sure

352
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,416
all these pieces were
part of the same casting.

353
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,543
This creature is
called a South Bird.

354
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,920
You can still find them
on this island today.

355
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,006
Wow, and they
have a peculiar call?

356
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,883
Uh‐huh. Just like
in the logbook.

357
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,759
Sailors have
used South Birds on ships

358
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,262
since ancient times
to help them nav‐‐

359
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,683
[CRICKET, MASIRA, SHOJO]
Oh, no!

360
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,809
What's wrong?

361
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,810
This is really bad!

362
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,769
You guys gotta get to the forest

363
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,897
on the south side of
the island right away!

364
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,773
Huh? What do you mean?

365
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,733
Are you crazy?

366
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,817
Don't waste a minute,

367
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,694
you gotta capture one
of these birds and quickly!

368
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,029
How come? Why?

369
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,697
[SANJI]
What do we need the bird for?

370
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,324
Now listen carefully!

371
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,618
Tomorrow you're going to
sail for the Knock‐Up Stream.

372
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,328
It lies directly south of here.

373
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,288
How are you going to get there?

374
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,335
We just sail the ship
due south, of course.

375
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,086
[CRICKET] Have you forgotten
this is the Grand Line?

376
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,671
You're heading for open sea!

377
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,632
You won't be able
to get your bearings.

378
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,925
Wait, he's right.

379
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,969
Without a landmass to lock onto,
the Log Pose will be useless,

380
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,971
and there'll be no way
for us to navigate.

381
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:31,931
But there's got to be some way

382
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,391
we can figure out
which direction to sail.

383
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,977
There is if you can lay your
hands on one of these birds!

384
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,355
Certain animals
are known to have

385
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,523
a very accurate internal
sense of direction,

386
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,359
as if they're born
with a natural compass.

387
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,735
[laughs]

388
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,404
That makes Zoro
dumber than an animal!

389
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,698
Oh yeah right, like
you have any room to talk.

390
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,367
The South Bird
is a perfect example

391
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,952
of this kind of creature.

392
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,747
[CRICKET] In the middle
of a vast, barren plain

393
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,831
or a trackless ocean,

394
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,961
its body will always point
in the same direction.

395
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,671
[LUFFY]
Ohhh...

396
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,672
You see?

397
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,090
If you don't get going
to that forest and catch

398
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,008
one of those birds right
now, you'll have to kiss

399
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,094
you're only chance to get
to sky island goodbye!

400
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,387
Aaah!

401
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,014
And you're just
telling us this now?

402
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,850
[CRICKET]
Quit your whining!

403
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,143
There's no time for that now!

404
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,019
Go!

405
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,104
Move it or lose it!

406
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,647
You expect us to go
stumbling through the forest

407
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,856
in the middle of the night?

408
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,525
[CRICKET]
Don't forget these!

409
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,778
The three of us are gonna
get started on the repairs

410
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,655
to your broken‐down ship.

411
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,864
You know,
now that I think about it,

412
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,825
we probably shouldn't
have had that party.

413
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,994
Oh, sure, now you tell us!

414
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:35,536
Listen!

415
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,537
The clock's ticking.

416
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,372
You have until morning
to catch a South Bird

417
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,790
or you can forget
about the whole thing!

418
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,503
[LUFFY]
Whoa, it's pitch black!

419
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,630
[SANJI] Will you let
go of me, you idiot?

420
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,679
My stomach's still
so stuffed from that dinner.

421
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,348
I couldn't catch
a bird if I saw one.

422
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,809
So where are they?

423
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,478
Let's just catch one of
'em and get back to drinkin'.

424
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,481
Will someone remind me how
we ended up in this mess?

425
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,357
[SANJI]
Move it!

426
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,692
Man, he couldn't
tell us in the daylight,

427
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,278
it had to be the
middle of the night.

428
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,195
Where are the birds?

429
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,739
If I had any idea
where the birds were,

430
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,074
do you think we'd out
here looking for them?

431
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,368
[LUFFY] All we know is this
thing's got a peculiar call.

432
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,286
Yeah, and it looks

433
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,288
just like that gold statue
he showed us.

434
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,748
It's kinda hard
for me to believe any bird

435
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,750
could be that screwy
looking in real life.

436
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,586
Anyway, saying it has
a peculiar call is too vague,

437
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,087
we can't I. D. it from that!

438
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,589
Well, the old coot
didn't seem to think

439
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,340
we'd have any
trouble finding one.

440
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,384
[SOUTH BIRD]
Duuuuu!

441
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,720
Hey! That sounded peculiar!

442
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,679
Oh, ya think?

443
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,805
Yeah!

444
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,183
Well, we're here. Let's do it
and get it over with!

445
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,434
Three nets, three teams.

446
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,852
Let's split up
and bag that bird!

447
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,103
[LUFFY, ZORO]
Right!

448
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:43,771
Let's go!

449
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,106
We're gonna beat up a bird!

450
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,401
We're trying to catch it!

451
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,533
Don't worry, Nami‐baby,

452
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,286
no matter what we run into,
I'm here to protect you.

453
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,579
Me too, Sanji‐lump?

454
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,248
Will you suck it up
and stop being such a wuss?

455
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,208
Come on, guys,

456
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,127
let's catch that bird
and get out of here!

457
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,087
Okay, let's all settle down

458
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,507
and see if we can hear
that bird's call again.

459
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,133
[sound]
Chee‐awww!

460
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,676
Hey, there it is!

461
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,261
[USOPP]
Chee‐aw!

462
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,429
Come on out!

463
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,180
[SANJI]
Moron!

464
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,182
Chee‐aaw!

465
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,767
Hey, why are you catching me?

466
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,228
Huh? Hey, nice
accessorizing there, Nami!

467
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,479
Where'd you get that thing?

468
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,482
What thing? Ah!

469
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,359
Spider!

470
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,777
[shrieks]

471
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,612
[USOPP]
What, it's just a spider.

472
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,239
Come here, you poor thing.

473
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,199
I hate spiders, you idiot!

474
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,826
Throw that thing away!

475
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,411
Get rid of it, Usopp,
it's gotta be poisonous!

476
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,164
Ahh! They're falling
from the trees!

477
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,458
This is, just, too nasty.

478
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,627
I bet you're a
species of tarantula!

479
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,796
Don't worry, you guys,
they don't bite you

480
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,631
unless you make them
angry or frighten them.

481
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,842
I used to wrestle with spiders
like this all the time.

482
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,301
Are you outta
your tiny little mind?

483
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,804
Hairy bugs like that
completely freak me out!

484
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,721
Yeah, me too!

485
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,140
They make my flesh crawl!

486
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,808
Throw it away, I can't stand it!

487
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,684
Oh, really?

488
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,893
But you don't seem
to have any problem

489
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,147
with those centipedes and
moths on the tree behind you.

490
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,613
I hate those things too!

491
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,158
[shrieks]

492
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,535
[USOPP]
Wait! Don't leave me here alone!

493
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,537
[ROBIN]
Wait!

494
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,414
That sounded like
someone screaming.

495
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,707
Really?

496
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,173
A centipede, and a big one.

497
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,383
You don't have to kill every
living thing we meet,

498
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,759
it's kind of rude.

499
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,388
Yeah, well, he shouldn't
have snuck up on me.

500
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,306
Hey, wait!

501
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,390
[ZORO]
Now what?

502
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,851
You're going back
the way we came.

503
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,395
[SOUTH BIRD]
Duuuuu!

504
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,563
There it is again!

505
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,523
Come on!

506
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,443
And be careful not
to step in the quicksand.

507
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,529
Hey! Wait for‐‐

508
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,865
[grunts]

509
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,536
[laughs] I gotcha!

510
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,913
It's an Atlas!

511
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:06,872
[CHOPPER]
Atlas?

512
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,832
That's right. This one
and the Hercules beetle

513
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,459
are some of the
most prized insects

514
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,211
in the world for collectors!

515
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,296
You mean there are
people who collect insects?

516
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,297
[LUFFY]
Oh, yeah!

517
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,882
And these guys are some
of the hardest to catch!

518
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,635
Hey, which one is cooler,
that bug or the One Piece?

519
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,970
Ah! That's a tough one!

520
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,264
[CHOPPER] Luffy!
There's one over here too!

521
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:24,973
Oh, yeah!

522
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,850
A Miyama stag beetle!

523
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,560
Gotta catch it!

524
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,396
[CHOPPER]
He flew away!

525
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,524
Duuuuu!

526
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,985
[LUFFY] After him!
Don't let him get away!

527
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,322
[LUFFY]
A beehive! Run!

528
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,421
[LUFFY] What the heck
is wrong with this forest?

529
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,423
Luffy, look up there!

530
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,341
[LUFFY]
The bird!

531
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,801
He's the one
who dropped the beehives!

532
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,345
Duuu! Duuu!

533
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,638
What'd he say?
What'd he say?

534
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,765
Did you understand him?

535
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,933
[CHOPPER]
Uhh.

536
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,395
He said, "I'll kill anyone
who disturbs this forest!"

537
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,699
Now, now, little boy,

538
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,493
you don't really want to go
and make us angry, do you?

539
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,662
[MASIRA] It's not nice to show
up in the middle of the night

540
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,456
and demand gold from someone.

541
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,458
Now get lost,
we've got a lot of work to do

542
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,793
and not a lot of time to do it.

543
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,796
[BELLAMY laughs]
You must be the bodyguards.

544
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,924
And the old man must be
the ex‐pirate Cricket.

545
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,883
I heard the sad story

546
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,636
of the Montblanc family
back at the tavern.

547
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,596
It moved me to tears.

548
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:50,100
But stealing another man's
treasure moves me even more.

549
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,477
I'm a pirate. Ha!

550
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,478
Cricket!

551
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,813
Maybe you'd like to
know what people call me

552
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,898
before I take your
whole life's work.

553
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,816
The Hyena!

554
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,652
[laughs]

555
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:06,825
<i>♪Now, I look up and see,</i>

556
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,495
<i>beyond the endless</i>

557
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:14,082
<i>Possibilities,</i>

558
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:21,340

559
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,814
<i>When I am alone</i>

560
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:43,695

561

562
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:50,911

563
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:55,916

564
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,502

565
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:03,048

568
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,438
[LUFFY]
Old‐timer!

569
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,689
We caught a bird!

570
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,066
Hey, what happened to you guys?

571
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,943
[CRICKET]
I'm really sorry, kid.

572
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,113
We did what we could to stop
them, but it just wasn't enough.

573
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,906
[NAMI]
Look! The gold's been stolen!

574
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,574
[CRICKET] It's all right!
It doesn't matter!

575
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,700
Forget about that junk!

576
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,619
[NAMI]
Bellamy's mark!

577
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,579
[LUFFY]
I'll be back by morning!

578
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,123
On the next One Piece!

579
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,749
"Dreams Don't Come True?!

580
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,210
Bellamy Versus
the Saruyama Alliance!"

581
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,879
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
