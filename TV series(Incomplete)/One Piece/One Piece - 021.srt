00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,565
to inquire how you're
paying for your meal?

175
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,037
Will a bullet be enough?

176
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,805
So you don't have
any money then.

177
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,807
‐‐[FULLBODY] What?
‐‐[CUSTOMERS gasp]

178
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,243
That dumb ass, Patty,
broke another chair.

179
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,045
Whoa... What power...

180
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,183
Sorry, pirate, but our policy is
to only serve paying customers.

181
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,218
‐‐[CUSTOMERS whistle, cheer]
‐‐You tell him!

182
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,252
Kick his ass, Patty.

183
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,754
Show that pirate we
cooks don't screw around!

184
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,989
[stomach rumbles]

185
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,657
[PATTY]
Aww, I can hear

186
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,260
your stomach grumbling
from here, pirate.

187
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,028
That was a fart, jerk.

188
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:16,863
Now, listen...

189
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,699
Get me... something...
to eat now...

190
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,268
We're not getting you
anything, so beat it!

191
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,216
[CUSTOMERS cheering]

192
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,085
[GHIN grunts]

193
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,887
[FULLBODY]
I can't take anymore.

194
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,189
All of these cooks are insane!

195
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,790
I've gotta get outta here.

196
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,260
I don't want anything to do
with this place ever again!

197
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:51,797
[cheering continues]

198
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,133
[PATTY]
And now, you damn crooks...

199
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,870
If you need anything,
just ask, okay? [laughs]

200
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,643
And please, never come back.

201
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,710
[PATTY grunts]

202
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,414
[GHIN groans]
Dammit,

203
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,651
if I wasn't so weak from hunger,
I'd be inside eating...

204
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,654
[grunts] And he'd be lying here.

205
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,292
Hey, you're not hungry,
by any chance, are ya?

206
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,928
[GHIN] No... I'm not...
Just leave me alone...

207
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,429
[stomach rumbles]

208
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,898
‐‐[door creaks]
‐‐[LUFFY] Hm?

209
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:27,967
[GHIN gasps]

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,001
Huh?

211
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,242
Eat up.

212
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,276
[GHIN gulps]

213
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,080
[GHIN]
Take it and leave me alone!

214
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,782
I won't accept charity;

215
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,151
it doesn't matter how
down and out I may be.

216
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,186
Just take this stuff away, now!

217
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,957
Stop your whining
and eat it already.

218
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,458
I don't care what
they say in there.

219
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,461
To me, if anyone's hungry,
they're a customer.

220
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,964
Sorry, but I'm
not your customer.

221
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:02,101
[stomach rumbles]

222
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,303
[SANJI growls]

223
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,706
[SANJI] It's amazing
how beautiful and cruel

224
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,775
this ocean can be, how it's
almost a death sentence

225
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,345
to lose your food
and water out here,

226
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,947
how difficult it is to survive.

227
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,282
I know what it
means to go hungry

228
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,884
because of the sea
more than anyone.

229
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,788
You can die for your
pride if you want.

230
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,824
But listen, if you
and eat and survive,

231
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:25,958
won't that give
you the opportunity

232
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,827
to fight for pride
truly worth having,

233
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,228
now and in the future?

234
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,463
[GHIN gasps]

235
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,700
[GHIN gulps]

236
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,978
[GHIN sobbing]
I'm sorry...

237
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,481
I'm sorry...
Thank you so much...

238
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,917
I thought it was over, I truly
thought I was going to die.

239
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,257
[GHIN sobbing]
This food...

240
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,759
...it's delicious.

241
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,862
I've never eaten food
this good before.

242
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:07,767
[GHIN sniffling, snorting]

243
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,235
Of course it is...

244
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,037
[LUFFY laughs]

245
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,106
I think I just found my cook!

246
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,108
You're lucky he
gave you some food!

247
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,111
You weren't lookin' so
good there... [laughs]

248
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,880
I thought you were a goner!

249
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,881
So listen, Mr. Cook,

250
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,283
why don't you leave this
boat and join my crew?

251
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,284
[SANJI]
Huh?

252
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,454
I could use a cook like
you on my pirate ship!

253
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,889
[SANJI, GHIN]
Huh?

254
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,441
[SANJI]
So you're a pirate?

255
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,109
Uh‐huh.

256
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,111
Is that why you went and
did a crazy thing like

257
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,447
shoot a cannonball
into the restaurant?

258
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,481
[LUFFY]
That was an accident!

259
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,284
It was self‐defense that
turned into a stray shot!

260
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,419
[SANJI]
A stray shot?

261
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,154
In any case, you
really don't want to

262
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,057
do anything stupid
to this place.

263
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,994
The owner used to be a cook
in a famous pirate fleet.

264
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:13,165
Ohh... So the old man...
used to be a pirate...

265
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,735
This restaurant is everything
to that crazy old man.

266
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,938
It's the only treasure he'll
need for the rest of his life...

267
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,272
He'll do anything to protect it.

268
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,974
On top of which,
all of the cooks who

269
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,976
joined him out of
respect and admiration

270
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,079
are just as hot‐headed
as any pirate...

271
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,414
Which helps since
pirates are always

272
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,249
coming and going
out of this place.

273
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,017
[LUFFY]
Yeah, I've noticed that.

274
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,955
This is a really wild
restaurant, huh? [chuckles]

275
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,424
So true... And this is
how it is every day.

276
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,358
It's gotten so bad that

277
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,827
customers are coming
here just watch fights

278
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,829
between the cooks
and the pirates.

279
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,766
Every day, it's been a new
pirate ship and a new rampage.

280
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,335
It wasn't long till all the
waiters got scared and bailed.

281
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:50,636
Ah, that makes sense!

282
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:54,507
So that's why the old man wanted
me to work for him for a year.

283
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,976
So, you joining my
pirate crew or what?

284
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,811
I'm sorry, but I can't...

285
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,946
There's a reason I have to
work here in the restaurant,

286
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,882
and so I can't just
walk away from it.

287
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,816
No way!

288
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:04,817
I don't accept!

289
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,952
What? You don't accept?!

290
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:07,887
It's very simple.

291
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,855
I refuse to accept your refusal!

292
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:10,956
You're a good cook,
and I need one,

293
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,526
so it's obvious that we
should be pirates together.

294
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,161
[SANJI grunts]
Listen to what I'm saying.

295
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,529
I can't leave here, all right?

296
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,297
What's your reason for staying?

297
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,199
I don't have to
tell you anything!

298
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,066
What the...?

299
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,135
But you just said
to listen to you!

300
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,503
I told you my answer was no,

301
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,205
and that's all you
need to hear from me.

302
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,541
Now take you pirate ship, and
find a cook someplace else

303
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,342
before I cut you up, Straw Hat!

304
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,811
You listen to me, jerk.

305
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,345
No one makes fun of my straw hat

306
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,848
unless they're
ready for a beating!

307
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,883
[GHIN]
I'm sorry to interrupt...

308
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:38,984
[LUFFY, SANJI]
What is it?!

309
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,052
My name is Ghin,

310
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,088
and I'm a crew member of
Don Kreig's Pirate fleet...

311
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,058
And you say that you're
a pirate yourself...

312
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,359
What is it you seek?

313
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,561
Oh, the One Piece!

314
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,897
And pretty soon, I'm gonna sail
the Grand Line and find it!

315
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:52,898
[GHIN]
Huh?

316
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,070
Well, you can't have been
seeking it for long.

317
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,405
If you don't even
have a cook yet,

318
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,540
your crew can't be all that big.

319
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,342
Nope, he's only
the fifth member.

320
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,544
I told you I'm not going,
so don't count me!

321
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,946
You seem like a nice kid,

322
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,281
so let me give you some
friendly advice, okay?

323
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,917
The Grand Line is a
place you want to avoid.

324
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,587
You're still young, there's
no need to rush into anything.

325
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:18,224
Remember, the Grand Line is one
small part of this entire ocean.

326
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,392
If you want to be a real
pirate, there are plenty of

327
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,929
other places out here
on the seas to explore.

328
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,598
[LUFFY]
Hmm... I see...

329
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,433
Well, why don't you just
tell me what to avoid

330
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,601
in the Grand Line now?

331
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,935
I can't...

332
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,437
I don't know anything.

333
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,439
I don't understand it.

334
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,375
And that is why I fear it.

335
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,444
[SANJI] For being a
crewmember of Don Kreig's,

336
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,446
you're a pretty
wimpy pirate.

337
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,948
[LUFFY]
Hm? Who's Don Kreig?

338
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:51,624
[COOKS chattering]

339
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,893
[COOK B] The appetizer
for table three is ready!

340
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,161
[COOK D] Yeah, well you're gonna
have to take it out yourself,

341
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,230
the last waiter's gone!

342
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,132
You think more of them
will be comin', Patty?

343
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,067
Who knows?

344
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,435
I heard the guy
you beat up earlier

345
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,504
in the restaurant was
one of Don Krieg's men.

346
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,474
I don't think that will make
the rest of them very happy.

347
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,910
Heh... I don't care
whose man he was.

348
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,646
All I'm saying is, the stories
I've heard say Don Krieg is

349
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,447
the strongest,
fiercest and most evil

350
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,082
pirate in this
part of the ocean.

351
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:17,950
He is.

352
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:18,984
[PATTY]
Eh?

353
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,321
[CARNE]
On these waters,

354
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,190
his grip of fear
reaches far and wide.

355
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,526
He commands over
50 pirate captains,

356
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,129
one of the largest
pirate fleets ever seen.

357
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,600
He is truly...

358
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,634
...a monster.

359
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,202
He doesn't scare me.

360
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,339
I've heard that his
extraordinary fleet

361
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,975
of ships has more than
five thousand pirates.

362
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,379
This could be bad
for Boss Zeff...

363
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,515
If that guy you beat up
goes to Don Krieg and

364
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,384
tells him what you did,
and he sends just one ship...

365
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,553
There won't be enough
of us to fight them off.

366
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,222
We'll be crushed, like
a grape under an elephant,

367
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,358
and left to sink to the
bottom of the ocean.

368
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,627
Eh...

369
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,329
You're saying I should
have just served him,

370
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,530
so he could experience our

371
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,066
great customer service
and meals for free?

372
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,367
You don't think that
would have been rude

373
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,502
to the other damn
crooks who pay money?

374
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,707
I would never stoop that low!

375
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,908
This is the Baratie.

376
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,712
The fighting cooks have a
reputation to uphold, don't we?

377
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,048
I'd never ruin that. I don't
care who that pirate cries to.

378
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,484
Let them send their ships.
I'll fight them all off.

379
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,053
If you're scared, quit and
let the real cooks work.

Don't you dare say that to me!

I just wanted to give
you a fair warning.

And to you, Chef...
Thank you for everything.

You saved my life,
and I owe you for that.

404

the best I've ever seen.

yelled at or fired

supposed to make that?

would get rid of him!

It is too difficult.

515
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,539
I am now prepared to sail to the
ends of the earth as a pirate

516
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:51,209
if it means someone of your
rare beauty will be by my side!

To be together sailing the seas!

But how tragic a great
obstacle blocks our way.

520
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:02,054
[ZEFF] And that great
obstacle would be me, right?

521

[SANJI sighs]
Stupid geezer.

523
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,259
This is an opportunity you
don't want to pass up.

524
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,061
Why not join them
and become a pirate?

you here at my restaurant.

and you were able
to return here to us.

Is that what you
are saying... Ghin?

533

[GHIN]
Y‐Yes... but you see...

534
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,266
I had no idea the main ship was
in this condition, Don Krieg...

535
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,601
No idea.
