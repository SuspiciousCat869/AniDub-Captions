[BROOK] Well, how could
I possibly refuse

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.254
going to her rescue?

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:17.189
I shall rush to
her aide in this,

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:18.857
her greatest moment of need!

00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:20.659
Completely selflessly,
of course.

00:19:20.692 --> 00:19:23.695
No hint of an ulterior motive.

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:26.298
Although, if she wanted
to show me her panties,

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:27.599
that would be fine.

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:29.735
[USOPP]
Wait, Brook, it might be a trap!

00:19:29.768 --> 00:19:31.703
No! This is awful!

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:33.872
The only one of them
who's willing to help us

00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:35.774
has the most impure
of intentions.

00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:38.076
She is in worse danger
now than ever!

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.611
Please take me with you!

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:40.879
You don't have to untie me,

00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:43.549
but I insist that I
accompany you, skeleton!

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:45.484
The tower is my jurisdiction!

00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:48.187
If anything happens to
the princess, I will never

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.656
be able to overcome
my shame!

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:04.870
[BROOK]
I understand.

00:20:04.903 --> 00:20:07.406
You desire...

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:08.840
...to see panties, too!

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.342
I would never!

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:11.376
You scoundrel!

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.345
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
It's not true!

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:14.446
[BROOK]
Forgive me, Sanji,

00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:17.916
but it looks like I'm
getting to her first!

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.321
[SHIRAHOSHI]
I'm sorry to burden you,

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:26.091
but it truly is my dream
to go to the Sea Forest.

00:20:26.124 --> 00:20:28.927
And these ten years, I couldn't.

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:30.662
Whenever I talk about
making the trip,

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:32.331
everyone goes out of
their way to tell me

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:34.866
how dangerous it would
be for me to leave.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.770
So I've never pushed the
issue because I'm too afraid.

00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:40.305
Tell me the truth.

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:42.708
Are you really willing to
take me to the Sea Forest

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:44.476
despite the trouble
you'll face?

00:20:44.509 --> 00:20:45.744
[LUFFY]
Yes.

00:20:45.777 --> 00:20:49.381
And you promise to protect me
no matter what happens, right?

00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:52.017
Of course I will.
Count on me!

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.619
[gasps]

00:21:00.859 --> 00:21:02.060
Whoa, hold on.

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.363
I'm not gonna do it
if you keep crying.

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:08.000
And if I'm being honest here,
you'll be the one taking me.

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:09.635
Since I can't swim and all.

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:10.969
Don't cry?

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:13.972
But that'll be hard
because I'm so happy.

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:16.408
Is there anything that
doesn't make you cry?

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:19.611
Well, anyway. When we
go to leave this place,

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:22.314
everyone's gonna recognize
you, aren't they?

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:24.149
Yes. That'll be a problem.

00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:26.151
No it won't, 'cause
I've got the perfect idea

00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:27.886
to get you outta here!

00:21:32.457 --> 00:21:36.762
[BROOK] Mermaid Princess!
Are you all right?

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:38.497
Look over there at the tower!

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.098
Do you see that, too, skeleton?

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:41.233
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:44.236 --> 00:21:47.205
[gasps] This is worse
than my greatest fear!

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:50.642
Those weren't the sounds
of axes or knives like usual.

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:55.614
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
What we heard were the bodies

00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:58.417
of human pirates slamming
against the tower!

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.520
How disgusting!
That Vander Decken!

00:22:01.553 --> 00:22:03.622
He's nothing short of a monster!

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:07.025
[gasps] Uh. I think
we're in trouble!

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:09.227
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Ah. I think you're right.

00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:11.229
It appears they all survived!

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:12.397
But how?

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:15.567
The Ryugu Palace is supposed
to be impregnable!

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.104
Yet we've been invaded
by enemy forces!

00:22:19.137 --> 00:22:23.608
The king. The princess.
Everyone here.

00:22:23.642 --> 00:22:26.144
We're all in danger!

00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:30.649
Hey, it sounds like
it finally stopped!

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:32.184
You ready, scaredy-cat?

00:22:32.217 --> 00:22:33.819
Uh. Sure.

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:36.021
We're counting on you, Megalo!

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:42.294
[thudding]

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:53.305
[PIRATES yell]

00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:55.774
[BOTH gasp]

00:22:55.807 --> 00:22:59.511
[laughs] Let's go!
Break through!

00:23:00.912 --> 00:23:02.013
Megalo?

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:04.149
And Luffy is with him!

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:08.820
We're off to the Sea Forest!

00:23:15.026 --> 00:23:16.728
[NARRATOR]
Luffy escapes with Shirahoshi,

00:23:16.762 --> 00:23:19.364
throwing the palace into
an even greater panic.

00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:21.433
The pirates who've
infiltrated its walls,

00:23:21.466 --> 00:23:23.769
attack with a
strange despiration,

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:24.736
carrying out a mission

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.205
that the Straw Hats
have yet to understand.

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:29.141
Meanwhile, after a
scuffle of their own,

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:32.511
Sanji and Chopper come
across an injured Hachi.

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:34.312
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:38.550
"The Ryugu Palace in Shock!
The Kidnapping of Shirahoshi!"

00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:40.819
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
