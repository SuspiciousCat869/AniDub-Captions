1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,533
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,327
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,830
in search of the One Piece,
the legendary treasure

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,417
left behind by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,961
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose
body turned to rubber

42
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,838
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,716
sets sail to become the next
King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,677
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,304
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,347
of the World Government,
which will use

47
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,350
any means necessary
to stop them.

48
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,604
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

49
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,857
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

50
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,985
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue.

51
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,863
The crew will cut a path
across the Grand Line

52
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,781
to the New World!

53
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,454
[NARRATOR] In an attempt
to rescue his brother Ace,

54
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,623
Luffy enlisted the aid
of the Pirate Empress,

55
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,959
Boa Hancock to sneak onto
a Navy Vessel on course

56
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,879
to the government prison,
Impel Down.

57
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,257
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
the other Straw Hat Pirates,

58
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,469
scattered across the globe
by Bartholomew Kuma,

59
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,804
faced struggles of their own.

60
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:45,225
As the time for Ace's public
execution draws closer

61
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,811
and closer, tensions rise
at Navy Headquarters

62
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:52,565
and the Warlords of the Sea
are called to battle.

63
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,572
Theirs nothing that can
stop that anymore, son.

64
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,575
Seems The Navy has made
the King of the Sea...

65
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,535
[ACE grunts]

66
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,829
...mad as hell!

67
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,667
[LUFFY]
A Deadly Infiltration!

68
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,836
The Underwater Prison,
Impel Down!

69
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:22,262
[GARP sighs] I wanted you and
Luffy to grow up and be Marines,

70
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,721
like your granddad.

71
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,433
But hopes be damned, you both
turned out to be hoodlums.

72
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,561
Notorious, dangerous
ones, at that.

73
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,563
[GARP]
I'm sure you heard about

74
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,649
what your brother's
been up to.

75
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,318
Now, I don't expect us
to get along perfect,

76
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,612
but challenging the
World Government head-on

77
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,907
and wrecking up Enies Lobby
is over the line.

78
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,451
I met him at
Water 7 after that,

79
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,537
and tried to knock
some sense into the boy

80
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,622
with a little tough love.

81
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,709
But that boy didn't
listen to a darn word I said.

82
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,627
In fact, he just
ran off to Sabaody

83
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,379
and caused an even bigger mess!

84
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,464
But I'm sure proud
he sticks to his guns!

85
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,677
[GARP laughing]

86
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,971
Oh, by the way.

87
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,808
I told the little punk
about his father.

88
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,768
[LUFFY]
Wait, what about my dad?

89
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,937
I didn't even think I had a dad.

90
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,981
[GARP]
The name of your father,

91
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,108
is Monkey D. Dragon.

92
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,319
The revolutionary.

93
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,532
[GARP] 'Course, the news
took him by surprise.

94
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,826
Can't blame the boy.

95
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,496
[ACE] "Our fathers?"
To hell with them.

96
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,750
And to hell with you if you ever
thought we could be Marines.

97
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,668
We've both got the
blood of criminals

98
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,086
flowing through our veins

99
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:41,090
and that was the only gift
those bastards ever gave us.

100
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,968
I took the name
"Portgas" from my mother

101
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,137
because I owe her so much.

102
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,599
But I don't owe my
"father" a damned thing.

103
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,018
I don't even
remember the bastard.

104
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,812
Heh. He can keep his name.

105
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,024
[GARP] I know, I know, but the
man tried. He wanted to--

106
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,942
[ACE]
Enough, all right?

107
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,738
Listen to me.

108
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,577
[WHITEBEARD]
You're worth too much to die

109
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,080
in a place like this.

110
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,876
Don't fight it.
Run wild with us.

111
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,087
Our flag, will be yours.

112
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,507
[WHITEBEARD]
And I will call you my son.

113
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,013
[ACE]
Whitebeard is my only father.

114
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,060
Got it, old man?

115
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,761
[MARINE 422A]
Admiral Momonga!

116
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,179
I've spotted a pirate ship!

117
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,181
[MOMONGA]
Do you know who it belongs to?

118
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,768
[MARINE 422A] Huh. Well,
the flag does look familiar.

119
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,978
I'll look into it.

120
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,105
Well, if you don't
recognize them,

121
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,566
then they can't
be anyone important.

122
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,569
Just leave them be.
We can't be bothered.

123
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,987
Not right now, at least.

124
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,196
[MARINES]
Sir!

125
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,701
[KABAJI]
That Sea King is huge!

126
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,536
What if it attacks?

127
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,788
He'd eat the whole
ship in one bite.

128
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,540
And that'd be the end of us.

129
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,791
[RICHIE moans]

130
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,628
[KABAJI]
Just stay over there.

131
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,673
[KABAJI sighs]
It's gone.

132
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,510
You know, we came
all this way, but now, we--

133
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,803
Wha--?

134
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,638
What are we supposed to do?

135
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,098
What can we do?

136
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,560
C'mon, Alvida,
you have a plan, right?

137
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,146
Don't ask me. it's your idea.

138
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,231
[ALVIDA] You're the geniuses
that spent all our money

139
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,816
on an Eternal Pose.

140
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,277
Don't act like I'm the one
who dragged you out here.

141
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,320
Well. Of course.

142
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,490
But still, we can't just
leave Buggy in Impel Down.

143
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,242
As his crew, we gotta
go save him. Poor Captain!

144
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,036
[ALL sobbing]

145
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,955
[ALVIDA]
Hmph. Look around you.

146
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,957
We're about to enter
the Calm Belt.

147
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,752
That's the same as sailing
into a nest of Sea Kings.

148
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,795
You think this ship
is ready for that?

149
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,049
Of course, there is one
other way for us to get there.

150
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,510
But that's reserved
for Navy vessels.

151
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,719
We're a pirate ship.

152
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,014
The Gates of Justice won't
be opened for people like us.

153
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,516
You're kidding me!

154
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,893
I thought breaking him
out was the hard part.

155
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,894
And now this?

156
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,105
Now we find out we can't
even get to the place?

157
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,650
He and his buddy Ace
are gonna be killed--

158
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,527
We gotta help somehow!

159
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,695
[RICHIE sobbing]

160
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,155
Oh, Richie!

161
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,325
You miss the Captain too,
don't you big guy?

162
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,786
[RICHIE sobbing]

163
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,329
This would never work.

164
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,082
Don't kid yourself.
You can't break in or out

165
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,126
of the greatest prison
in the whole world.

166
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,213
Better for us to quit
while we're still ahead.

167
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,090
Buggy the Clown had a good run,

168
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,634
but I'm afraid his luck
as a pirate has run out.

169
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,886
[MOHJI]
No. I refuse to accept it!

170
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,179
He's a man among men.

171
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,266
The only way Captain Buggy can
go out is in a blaze of glory!

172
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,184
Our Captain's not
going anywhere.

173
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,811
Especially not the grave--

174
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,105
until he finds
Captain John's Treasure Island.

175
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,189
That's final!

176
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,985
And until that day comes,
we're sticking with him!

177
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,697
[ALL sobbing]
Captain Buggy!

178
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,865
You just let it all out!

179
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,201
Don't be afraid to cry.
We all feel the same way!

180
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,581
[RICHIE blubbering]

181
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,874
[BUGGY PIRATES]
Richie!

182
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,752
[ALVIDA]
Fine. Have fun.

183
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,087
I'm gonna take the Big Top

184
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,964
and get the hell
out of this place.

185
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,924
You guys can use a
life raft or something.

186
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,134
[BUGGY PIRATES]
What?

187
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,260
[MOHJI]
How could you?

188
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,763
This is Captain Buggy's
ship, not yours!

189
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,600
[ALVIDA] Well, I don't see
Buggy anywhere, do you?

190
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,811
[RICHIE groans]
[MOHJI] No. I guess not.

191
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,980
[ALVIDA] I'm not gonna
march to death's doorstep.

192
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:10,318
And as for this ship.
I won't let you waste it.

193
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,154
Those conditions aside,
if you wanna rescue Buggy

194
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,114
on your own,
then I won't stop you.

195
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,324
[BUGGY PIRATES gasp]

196
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:19,869
You can't scare us!

197
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,413
Who cares about Sea Kings
or government prisons!

198
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,957
We'll rescue Buggy
for sure, right?

199
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,293
[ALL]
Yeah!

200
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,836
[ALVIDA]
But I'll be frank, boys.

201
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,756
You're not going to last
5 minutes in those waters.

202
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,924
[ALL gasping]

203
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,136
Captain! Thank you
for everything.

204
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,929
But this is farewell!

205
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,391
Your dream will live on!
In our hearts, at least!

206
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,060
[RICHIE growling]

207
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,395
[BUGGY PIRATES]
Have a peaceful execution!

208
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,314
Maybe it'll be fun!

209
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,149
[BUGGY CREW A] See you
in the next life, Captain!

210
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,651
[RICHIE moans]

211
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,944
[MOHJI]
I feel your grief, Richie!

212
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,321
There's no shame in sadness!

213
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,073
[RICHIE sobs]

214
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:05,831
[MOMONGA] This is Momonga,
Marine Code G100660.

215
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,708
We'll be sailing on
the current shortly,

216
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,002
so prepare to open the Gate.

217
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,796
[NARRATOR]
The Navy ship Luffy and Hancock

218
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,964

[PRISONER 422C groaning]
Just let me die!

225
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:09,770
[PRISONER POINTY EARS] Hey,
new guy! You don't get to eat,

226
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,022
until you pay respects
to the cell leader--

227
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,441
them's the rules around here.

228
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,817
[PRISONER NEW GUY]
Hmph.

229
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,819
What, you want me
to do a little curtsy

230
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,196
every time I take a
bite outta something?

231
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,406
Screw you.

232
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,323
[PRISONER POINTY EARS]
No.

233
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,409
I want you to give
your food to the boss,

234
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,828
so I don't have to pound
your sorry brains in.

Huh?

238
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,178

Ya get it now?

Hey, buddy.

00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,875
No need to get
bent outta shape--

243
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,126
it was just a little
disagreement!

244
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,377
I just got here, man,

245
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,047
I'm not even on death row!
Now lemme out!

246
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,465

[growling]

250
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,078
[NARRATOR] Four and a
half days have passed

251
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,958
since Luffy and Hancock left the
Maiden Island of Amazon Lily.

252
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,919
[MARINE 422A] Vice Admiral!
We have arrived at Impel Down!

253
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,420
[MARINE 422B]
Hurry and open the gate!

254
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,089
[MARINES]
Aye-aye sir!

255
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,111
All right. Impel Down.

256
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,779
This is it.

257
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,032
[MARINE 422C]
I'm sorry sir.

258
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,117
It's just that,
we're a bit late, sir.

259
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,453
The headwinds delayed us,
but we contacted the prison.

260
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,623
[MOMONGA]
Mm. We are late.

261
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,082
Damn.

262
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,001
Call Hancock, and quickly.

263
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,169
Sir!

264
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,838
[MARINE 422D] Uh, Lady Hancock,
ma'am, we've arrived.

265
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,048
[HANCOCK]
One moment.

266
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,341
This is crazy!

267
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,011
They got more ships here than
they did for the Buster Call.

268
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,930
[HANCOCK]
Considering the circumstances,

269
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,350
this might be the most dangerous
place in the world right now.

270
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,517
But wait.

271
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,519
You've seen a Buster Call?

272
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,188
It's amazing you survived.

273
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,358
I've heard it said that
they're quite terrifying.

274
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,404
[HANCOCK]
The strongest military action

275
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,323
the Navy is authorized to take.

276
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,617
An all-out attack from
five vice-admirals

277
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,203
with a fleet of 10 vessels.

278
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,919
[LUFFY]
Ace is here? You're sure?

279
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,421
[HANCOCK] Yes, although I
imagine he's deep underwater.

280
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,132
Hurry. Step inside my cloak.

281
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,982
[MARINES] Welcome to Impel Down,
Vice Admiral Momonga!

282
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:33,242
[MARINES cheering]

283
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,661
Whoa. She's so...

284
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,662
...purdy!

285
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,081
Yep! She sure is!

286
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,624
She's the best in the world!

287
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,168
[MARINE 422G] If beauty
is power, she's the queen!

288
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,963
[MARINE 422H] A thousand volts--
no, it's like 10 thousand!

289
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,173
Straight to the heart, baby!

290
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:54,054
These men are an affront
to my poor ears, Momonga.

291
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,473
May I please turn them to stone?

292
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,271
I would rather you not.

293
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,397
I dare say,

294
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,359
you've embarrassed the Marines
enough for one lifetime.

295
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,030
[LUFFY]
Hey. Are we inside now?

296
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,699
Not yet. Stay calm.

297
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,742
Please.

298
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,077
[MOMONGA] Now, about that
condition of yours.

299
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,663
Before aiding in his
execution, you wanted to meet

300
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,707
Portgas D. Ace, correct?

301
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:25,210
Let me warn you once more,
that Warlord or not.

302
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,338
As a pirate,
you're not welcome here.

303
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,674
As a result, before you enter,

304
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,427
they will perform
a full body search.

305
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,179
They will also
require you to wear

306
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,973
sea prism stone
handcuffs inside.

307
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,600
They have to ensure
that you don't launch

308
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,144
any ill-fated attempts
at rescuing Ace

309
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,022
or any other prisoners.

310
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,233
[HANCOCK] Luffy.
They're doing a body check.

311
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,110
[LUFFY]
We'll figure something out.

312
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,612
Don't worry

313
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,619
Very well. Go.

314
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,704
[HANNYABAL]
What? Buggy the Clown?

315
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,623
You said he's missing?

316
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,459
And what's his power?

317
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,960
[DOMINO]
Excuse me, sir.

318
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,797
But Vice Admiral Momonga
and Empress Hancock

319
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,423
of the Seven Warlords
have arrived.

320
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,717
Right. I'll greet them.

321
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,514
She's great! Wait, I mean,
somebody open the gate!

322
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,475
C'mon, quick! Let her in!

323
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,784
[HANCOCK]
All right. This is it.

324
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:44,832
[GUARDS giggling]
Careful in there!

325
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,834
We love you Hancock!

326
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,794
Have a nice visit!

327
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,087
[HANCOCK]
Silence, imbeciles!

328
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,799
[GUARDS] Aw, she's so
sexy when she's angry!

329
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,811
[PRISONER 422G]
Let me out!

330
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,771
[PRISONER 422H]
I'm dyin' in here!

331
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,357
[PRISONER 422I]
Nobody deserves this!

332
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,943
[MOMONGA] It certainly
lives up to its reputation.

333
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,988
This is quite hellish indeed.

334
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,031
[HANCOCK]
We've made it this far,

335
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,826
but I fear the worst
is ahead of us.

336
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,038
[HANNYABAL]
Welcome to my prison.

337
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,623
Impel Down.

338
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,625
Oops jumped the gun there.

339
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,879
It's not, well,
exactly mine just yet.

340
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,507
I'm the Vice Warden Hannyabal--
well, for now at least.

341
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,093
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Vice Admiral.

342
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,011
[MOMONGA]
Likewise.

343
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,013
[HANNYABAL]
We've been expecting you.

344
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,391
Ah. And this must be
the pirate empress.

345
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,979
My pirate empress perhaps?
Oopsie, jumped the gun again,

346
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,814
that's a bit ambitious,
I suppose.

347
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,566
The dumbass warden is.

348
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,735
Oopsie. Not what I meant.

349
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,737
The perfectly competent warden,

350
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,907
Magellan is waiting
in his office on level 4.

351
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,034
He told me he would
like to meet with you.

352
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,161
Our vice manager
of the jail here,

353
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,206
Miss Domino, will be more than
happy to guide you there.

354
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,082
[DOMINO] It seems
you're in a rush, Empress,

355
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,627
so allow me to get this
unpleasantness out of the way.

356
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,629
If you follow me, we'll
conduct our body search

357
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,088
and begin the tour.

358
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,550
[DOMINO]
If you were a new prisoner.

359
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,886
We would have you enter
the cell over there.

360
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,596
Strip off all your clothes.

361
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,599
And push you into an iron pot
filled with boiling water.

362
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,100
We call it "Hell's Hot Tub".

363
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,646
It's a baptism and sanitation
solution all in one.

364
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,773
Very economical, I think.

365
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,775
We have quite a number
of "celebrity" prisoners,

366
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,817
by the way.

367
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,528
As you know, Fire Fist Ace
showed up recently.

368
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,738
But that's not all.

369
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,864
[LUFFY gasps]

370
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,117
[DOMINO] Jimbei of the Seven
Warlords is a new addition.

371
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,787
And the former Warlord,
Crocodile has made his residence

372
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,205
here for a while now.

373
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,206
For the record.

374
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,625
Both are model prisoners
that didn't bat an eye

375
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,710
at their little baptism.

376
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,590
And don't worry.

377
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,884
We search our visitors
in a private room.

378
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,511
After you.

379
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,726
[door creaks]

380
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,019
Before we start.

381
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,021
Could you please
take off your cloak?

382
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,233
It would be far too easy for you
to hide something inside there.

383
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,652
So I'm afraid you'll
have to leave it behind.

384
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,029
Don't mistake our
thoroughness for mistrust.

385
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,032
We simply have a reputation
we would like to uphold.

386
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,493
And as you can see
on the wall here,

387
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,788
we have Surveillance Transponder
Snails all over the prison.

388
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,123
Their video footage is monitored

389
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,542
in one of several
security rooms.

390
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,668
[SURVEILLANCE GUYS]
Whoa!

391
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,586
[SUVEILLANCE GUY 422A]
So that's the pirate empress?

392
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,672
[SURVEILLANCE GUY 422B]
I heard she was hot, but like.

393
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,923
Wow.

394
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,175
[SURVEILLANCE GUY 422C] Come on,
snails, Daddy needs a closeup.

395
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,094
Zoom in. Zoom in!

396
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,014
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL buzzing]

397
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,600
[SURVEILLANCE GUYS]
Oh! She's so cute!

398
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,523
Oh. And don't forget these.

399
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,192
[DOMINO] Keep in mind that
they're sea prism stone.

400
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,528
You call me a "visitor" here.

401
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,032
Not a prisoner.
Then you put me in those?

402
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,131
[NARRATOR]
Countdown to Ace's Execution.

403
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,093
33 Hours.
