[ZORO] Well, not by
standing around here.

[USOPP] But if everything in
this area's going to explode,

00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,849
then the cannon guy has to
be far away, doesn't he?

Or else he'd just blow
up with the rest of it.

He's a pirate. I'm surprised
you haven't heard about him yet.

00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,548
[CROCODILE] He can't be
serious about this, can he?

178
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,716
[yelps]

179
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,122
I guess I shouldn't
drunk that much water.

180
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,525
[laughing]

181
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,859
[growls]

182
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,795
[CROCODILE] Does this idiot
really not understand

183
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,663
what's going on here?

184
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,504
[growling]

185
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:09,108
Damn it, stop your
messing around!

186
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,623
[CROCODILE]
Damn that brat!

187
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,726
Who said I was messing around?

188
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,728
[CROCODILE]
My body...

189
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,530
[LUFFY] I'm always serious!
Let me show ya!

190
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,833
Now Gum‐Gum...

191
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,471
...Bazooka!

192
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:08,601
[chuckles] How was that,
Sand Croc?

193
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:37,897
That's amazing!
He beat Crocodile?

194
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,966
That kid is weird,
but incredible!

195
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,737
There's no time now for
all this admiration.

196
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,906
We have other things to do.

197
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,110
[screams]

198
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:54,613
[MISS ALL SUNDAY] Get up.
It's time for us to get moving.

199
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,117
You are going to show me
the way to the Poneglyph.

200
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,819
What're you planning to do?

201
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,288
How could looking at
it possibly help you?

202
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,690
[groans]

203
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,760
Just stop asking questions.

204
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,896
All you have to do is
show me where it is.

205
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,804
Your luck's beginning
to run out.

206
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,942
You certainly did try, but
there's not much time left.

207
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,047
[CROCODILE] You should get
going now, Nico Robin.

208
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,751
Unless you want to be dried
up along with this brat.

209
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:37,690
Go. Now. I'm done playing games.

210
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,627
Nico Robin?

211
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,965
Yes, as you wish.

212
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,938
[CROCODILE growls]

213
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,707
[CROCODILE]
Listen up, Straw Hat.

214
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,810
I'm going to destroy every
last rock on this ground.

215
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,945
And you along with them.

216
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,213
[gasps]

217
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,656
[LUFFY]
All the grass is dying.

218
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,159
[screams]

219
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,327
[growls]

220
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,063
[CROCODILE]
Ground Secco!

221
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,235
[yelping]

222
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,070
[screaming]

223
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,039
[LUFFY]
Falling!

224
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,942
[LUFFY]
Ah! That was close!

225
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:34,980
All right.
Water‐Water... Pistol!

226
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,186
Ah! His hand sucked it up.

227
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,720
[CROCODILE] You actually
thought you could

228
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,958
kill my powers, didn't
you, Water Luffy?

229
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,796
[CROCODILE] That was a very
foolish mistake to make.

230
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:56,402
The true power of sand is
drying things out. Watch.

231
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,304
My right hand can suck the life

232
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,340
out of anything by
turning it to dust.

233
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,143
Its power is limitless.

234
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,019
[gasps]

235
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,061
[laughs]

236
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,870
[LUFFY]
He wasn't exaggerating.

237
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,772
Even the statues are crumbling!

238
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,879
[LUFFY]
Everything is just dying.

239
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,013
[gasps]

240
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,748
My sandal!

241
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:46,418
Everything that is connected
to the ground is done for.

242
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,287
Including you.

243
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,190
Ground Death!

244
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:59,431
[laughing]

245
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:12,444
Okay, where is he?
Where's the cannoneer?

246
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,713
Only eight minutes left
till the cannon goes off!

247
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,048
Well, it's gonna have
to be enough time

248
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,116
to find the cannoneer.

249
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,251
We have to stop Crocodile's
attack from happening,

250
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,486
no matter what.

251
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,256
If we don't, then a million
people are gonna die here today!

252
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,727
[SANJI]
If there's a cannonball

253
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,296
that can blow up
that big an area,

254
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,365
it's got to come
from a big cannon!

255
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,267
Maybe it's in a building!

256
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,405
[SANJI]
Damn it!

257
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,310
Oh, crap, I just
thought of something.

258
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,979
If this entire area is gonna be
blown up in eight minutes,

259
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,480
then doesn't that mean
we're gonna be blown up

260
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:49,448
right along with it?

261
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,749
I don't like blowing up.

262
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,052
[ZORO]
No time to think about that!

263
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,488
[USOPP]
Look! Up there!

264
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,424
That's it!

265
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,261
But do you think we'll be able
to get up there quickly enough?

266
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,729
Hey!

267
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,467
[USOPP]
Why does he do this?!

268
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,207
[gasps]

269
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,810
Are you from the rebel army?

270
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,512
I can't waste any
time with you.

271
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,915
Goodnight, pal.

272
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,383
[screams]

273
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,120
Now cut it up, Zoro.

274
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,225
[growls]

275
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,262
[ZORO] This isn't it!
It's covered in moss!

276
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,446
[PELL]
I don't see it anywhere.

277
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,050
There's no sign at all of
a cannon or cannoneer.

278
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,519
I don't understand. Where is it?

279
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,793
[VIVI]
Only seven minutes left!

280
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:15,401
I'll stop it somehow!

281
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,770
I will!

282
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,845
Your name. He called
you Nico Robin.

283
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,113
Is that really your name?

284
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,782
What does it matter if it is?

285
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,951
Don't you have more important
things to worry about?

286
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,219
[COBRA]
Nico Robin.

287
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:38,824
That name was known throughout
the entire world 20 years ago.

288
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:42,227
Tell me, what did
you come here for?

289
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,797
Just show me to where the
Poneglyph is being kept.

290
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,666
That's all you need to
worry about right now.

291
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,471
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
What impeccable timing

292
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,541
you Marines have,
showing up right now.

293
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,743
Get out of the way.
We're in a hurry.

294
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:58,811
No chance!

295
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,012
Thanks to one of the soldiers,

296
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,281
I know everything that's been
going on here in Alubarna.

297
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,049
We're not moving.

298
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,885
That man, do you have
any idea who he is?

299
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,187
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
Yes, and I don't care.

300
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,988
I'm not listening to him, you,

301
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,757
or anyone else from
the government,

302
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,158
and I would strongly recommend

303
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,628
that you and your men
get out of my way.

304
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,698
We have no intention
of giving way to you!

305
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,101
Well then, you may not
live much longer.

306
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,770
Please hold on!
Don't be worried about me!

307
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,138
We've been warned that at 4:30,

308
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,307
a bomb is going to be shot
into the Palace Square

309
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,676
where the fighting's going on.

310
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,978
Please, you have to
go stop it now!

311
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,648
That's only... minutes from now!

312
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,616
If this attack happens,

313
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,152
it'll cost a million
citizens their lives!

314
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,054
[TASHIGI]
Well.

315
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:45,324
All right. We'll save you and
then we'll stop the attack.

316
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,725
[COBRA]
Wait! You don't know who she is!

317
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,927
Ready, men?

318
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,929
Move out of my way.

319
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,765
Treinta Fleurs!

320
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,933
Strangle!

321
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,102
A Devil Fruit.

322
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,138
I said I was
in a hurry, didn't I?

323
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,940
Don't make me angry with you.

324
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:07,045
That's her! It's
really Nico Robin!

325
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,280
I'm sure of it.

326
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,915
I looked up her old
wanted poster

327
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,317
because Captain Smoker
had asked me to do so.

328
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,686
That's really her.

329
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,888
She has a bounty.

330
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,790
Twenty years ago, the whole
world was talking about her.

331
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,858
I still remember the articles

332
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,295
that appeared in the
newspaper around that time.

333
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:27,766
In a terrifying incident, six
Marine warships were destroyed.

334
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,368
They said that an eight‐year‐old
girl was responsible

335
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,536
for sinking them.

336
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,238
The government classified
her as a first‐degree risk,

337
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,674
and they put an incredible
bounty on her head.

338
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:39,811
Seventy‐nine million Berries!
It's still an amazing sum!

339
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,315
But after that, she just
suddenly disappeared.

340
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,184
Stop your pointless rambling!

341
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:49,188
Either move out of my way
or you're all dead. Okay?

342
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,791
[TASHIGI] It's useless having
this many soldiers fight her.

343
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,561
[TASHIGI]
Sergeant!

344
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,063
Take the men and head to the
Square to stop the explosion.

345
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,331
But, Sergeant Major‐‐!

346
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,967
Just do it! There's
only minutes left!

347
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,602
[SERGEANT]
Right!

348
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,177
[TASHIGI]
Now, let that man go right away!

349
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,013
I've already warned you to move!

350
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,186
[LUFFY]
That was bad.

351
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:58,724
That right hand of his is
gonna be a big problem.

352
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,194
The entire lawn has been
turned into a desert.

353
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,898
Oh, great. Where'd he go now?

354
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,743
I'm quite tired of wasting
my time with you.

355
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,821

You have lost to me...
two times now,

359
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:52,311
Straw Hat Luffy.

[CROCODILE] This is a good
way to die, Straw Hat Luffy.
