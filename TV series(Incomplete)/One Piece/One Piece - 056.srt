00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:18,785
[GOLD ROGER]
Destiny. Fate. Dreams.

2
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:23,456
These unstoppable ideals are
held deep in the heart of man.

3
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,860
As long as there are people
who seek freedom in this life,

4
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,963
these things shall not
vanish from the earth!

5
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,639
<i>People tell me my</i>
<i>head's in the clouds</i>

6
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,974
<i>I don't care what they say</i>

7
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,809
<i>because I'm dreamin' of you</i>

8
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,779
<i>You are the treasure I've found</i>

9
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,548
<i>So bright, so bold,</i>
<i>yet so elusive</i>

10
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,051
<i>It's hard to look away,</i>

11
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,120
<i>even though it's blinding me</i>

12
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,789
<i>There are no words to describe</i>

13
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,657
<i>how I feel inside</i>

14
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,094
<i>I'm really really stuck</i>
<i>on you whoa, whoa!</i>

15
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,729
<i>I have to follow my dreams</i>

16
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,164
<i>however crazy they seem</i>

17
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,634
<i>And I won't stop 'til I</i>
<i>get there, you will see</i>

18
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,802
<i>You're all I need</i>

19
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,970
<i>to have the strength to believe</i>

20
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:17,110
<i>Believe in Wonderland!</i>

21
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,181
<i>I'm gonna follow my dreams,</i>

22
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,849
<i>however crazy they seem</i>

23
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,517
<i>I'm gonna share them with you,</i>

24
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,019
<i>a love so true</i>

25
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,622
<i>You're all I want,</i>
<i>together we can move on</i>

26
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,025
<i>Live how we want to!</i>

27
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,693
<i>There is no limit to us,</i>

28
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,161
<i>we have the power of love</i>

29
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,531
<i>And we don't wanna</i>
<i>live ordinary lives</i>

30
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,968
<i>We have the chance</i>

31
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:47,107
<i>Believe in Wonderland!</i>

00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,951
[ERIC]
Whirlwind!

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,055
Creep really packs a punch.

34
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,390
[NAMI]
Finally! It's time.

35
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,992
Let's go!

36
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,130
[APIS screaming]

37
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,133
Nice try.

38
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,635
[APIS laughing]

39
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,571
[LUFFY]
Woo! Yeah!

40
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:27,313
Guys! We're goin' to
Lost Island! Set sail!

41
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,322
[LUFFY] "A Solitary Island
in the Distant Sea!

42
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,159
The Legendary Lost Island!"

43
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,562
[MARINE A]
All squad captains!

44
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:46,232
Assemble on the deck of
the flagship! On the double!

45
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,168
[MARINE B]
Where's the quartermaster?

46
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,669
[MARINE C]
Turn the yard this way!

47
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,271
[MARINE D]
No, no! To the right!

48
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,739
[MARINE E] We're gonna
need all the repair planks

49
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,174
from the other ships!

50
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,441
[MARINE F]
The flagship has to be fixed

51
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,443
and ready to sail
within the hour!

52
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,512
Move it!

53
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,014
Damn those pirates.

54
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,550
We'll lose them if these
repairs take too long.

55
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,684
[ERIC]
No, we won't.

56
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,687
In fact, letting them go now
would be to our benefit.

57
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,022
[LT. COMMANDER]
What do you mean?

58
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,256
[ERIC]
It's simple, really.

59
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,059
They went to dangerous lengths
to escape from this island.

60
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,461
Now why do you think
they did that?

61
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,198
Have you forgotten that
this island has a legend?

62
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,066
Let me refresh your memory.

63
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,569
It's about dragons and
a fabled nest on Lost Island.

64
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,537
[LT. COMMANDER]
Wait. Are you saying that‐‐?

65
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,707
Mm. It's only a guess.

66
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,076
But it is an educated guess.

67
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,546
If I'm correct, those Straw
Hats will lead us right to it.

68
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:44,057
[ERIC] Making a report to
Commodore Nelson, are we?

69
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,126
There's no need for that.

70
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,130
[MARINE G]
Um, but, Sir, I‐‐ Understood.

71
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,637
[ERIC] Dragonite,
the Elixir of Immortality.

72
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,472
It's finally within my grasp.

73
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,675
I'm not about it to turn it
over to a slob like Nelson.

74
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:07,614
It's mine and mine alone,
and with it, Eric the Whirlwind

75
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:11,117
will become Eric
the Unstoppable!

76
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,757
Where is it?!

77
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,429
[MARINE H] Y‐Your lunch,
Commodore. Here it is

78
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,098
[NELSON]
No!

79
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,033
That's not what I meant!

80
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,769
[COMMS]
I have news for you, Sir!

81
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,639
[NELSON] It's about time!
It took him long enough!

82
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,807
That's a report from
Eric, I assume?

83
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,708
Uh, no, Sir.

84
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,343
It's a message from
one of the Marines

85
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,545
at Warship Island that states:

86
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,814
"Eric has found a
Millennial Dragon."

87
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,450
He goes on to say that the
fleet's busy repairing damage

88
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,653
that the flagship sustained.

89
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:47,520
[whimpers]

90
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,223
[NELSON]
Curse you, Eric.

91
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,792
You find a legendary
Millennial Dragon

92
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,727
and you don't report it to me?!

93
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,662
Why?!

94
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,363
You're planning to take
all the Dragonite

95
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,199
for yourself, aren't you?!

96
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,303
You've got some nerve,
you mercenary!

97
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,708
[chuckles]

98
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,343
We'll see who has
the last laugh!

99
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,645
Captain, deploy the fleet
to Warship Island!

100
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,747
All ships, move out!

101
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,897
[NAMI] No wonder
it's called Lost Island.

102
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,665
It's not on any of the charts.

103
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,201
Its description doesn't even
match any of the islands

104
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,170
in the waters around
Warship Island.

105
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,839
[USOPP] Hey, Grandpa Ryu!
Which way should we go?!

106
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,175
Where's Lost Island?!

107
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,627
Hey.

108
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,733
I think he went to sleep again.

109
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,606
[APIS]
Sorry for the wait, everybody!

110
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,641
I hope you're all hungry!

111
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,744
Oh, no. Don't tell me
she cooked again.

112
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,279
No one was waiting for her food.

113
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,318
[USOPP]
Oh, Sanji! What a relief!

114
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,719
For a minute there,
I thought you weren't the one

115
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,720
who made the meal!

116
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,723
I'm so hap‐‐ Ah!

117
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:34,327
Lunchtime! Now eat up,
Grandpa Ryu!

118
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,796
Food! All right!

119
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,398
Yummy!

120
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,634
[LUFFY]
Uh?! Hot!

121
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,905
No. You... moron!

122
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,246
[screams]

123
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,347
Hold on!

124
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,681
Apis!

125
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,421
[APIS]
Grandpa Ryu!

126
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,275
[APIS]
Grandpa Ryu! Are you okay?!

127
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:28,881
[SANJI]
Perfect!

128
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,783
I go through the trouble
of making that food

129
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,652
and it all goes to waste!

130
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,454
You can make more
though, right?

131
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,523
Yeah, but the point is
we should never waste food.

132
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,629
What? What is it?

133
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,470
I know where Lost Island is.

134
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,339
The Dragons' Nest is somewhere
to the east of Warship Island.

135
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,340
[chuckles]

136
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,676
That's great! How'd you
know where to find it?!

137
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,678
Grandpa Ryu just remembered!

138
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:03,049
[BOTH laughing]

139
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,650
[LUFFY]
We know where it is!

140
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,720
Lost Island lies to the east
of Warship Island, guys!

141
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,589
Yeah! Grandpa Ryu said so!

142
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,990
[LUFFY]
Let's go!

143
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,326
[NAMI]
Usopp! Take the helm!

144
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,560
[USOPP]
You got it!

145
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,332
Right! We've spent
enough time here!

146
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,268
Now... to Lost Island!

147
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,377
[SANJI] Dammit!
You'd better eat all of that!

148
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,347
[LUFFY]
Oh! No problem!

149
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,749
[ERIC]
So they've changed course?

150
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:37,583
Yes.

151
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:38,518
The pirate ship
appears to be headed

152
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,554
for the waters east
of Warship Island.

153
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,558
They're making their move.

154
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,795
[LT. COMMANDER]
Turn the bows eastward! Now!

155
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,063
Full speed ahead!

156
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,899
We're going to show those
Straw Hat Pirates

157
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,367
what Marines are made off!

158
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,536
Cannoneers, get to
your gun batteries!

159
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,437
All hands, prepare for combat!

160
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,574
This is not a drill.
Our destination is‐‐

161
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,943
Lost Island, of course.

162
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,980
[LT. COMMANDER]
All ships, move out!

163
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:13,986
[SANJI]
Here, Zoro.

164
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,154
[ZORO]
Thanks.

165
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,557
[SANJI]
And another.

166
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,724
[ZORO]
Yeah.

167
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,593
[SANJI]
Here ya go.

168
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:21,894
[ZORO] Okay.

169
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:23,996
[SANJI]
Zoro.

170
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,097
[ZORO]
Right.

171
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,733
[SANJI]
And this one.

172
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,801
[ZORO]
Uh...

173
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,737
Can you hand 'em over to me
without talking please?

174
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:39,812
So Lost Island's supposedly out
in this direction somewhere.

175
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,082
Wonder what it looks like
and when we're gonna see it.

176
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,852
Hey! Can you see anything
from up there, Usopp?!

177
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,021
Nope! Not a single thing!

178
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,156
[LUFFY]
Oh.

179
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,159
We've come a long way,

180
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,328
but there's still no sign
of this Lost Island.

181
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,331
I hope this doesn't turn out
to be a wild goose chase.

182
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,665
[NAMI]
Mm...

183
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,267
And then there's Grandpa Ryu.

184
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,002
I wish there was some
way we could help him

185
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,871
remember a few more details.

186
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,641
Ah! That should do the trick!

187
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,277
So what say we bonk him
on the head with this anvil?

188
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,146
That should loosen some memories
in his old noggin all right!

189
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,314
No, that's mean!

190
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,883
[USOPP yelps]

191
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,664
[APIS]
Can you believe it, Grandpa Ryu?

192
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:35,134
We're almost there!
We're almost to Lost Island!

193
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,636
And it's there, right?

194
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,337
The Dragons' Nest you
told me about?

195
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,841
And if you go there, you'll
get all better, won't you?

196
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,744
What?

197
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,981
You're so nice, but you
don't have to thank me!

198
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,183
We're not even there yet!

199
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,071
So they followed us, huh?

200
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,609
[LUFFY]
What's that? Smoke?

201
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,053
[LUFFY] Oh, well. Guess we'll
know when we get closer.

202
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,688
[APIS whines]

203
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,723
[APIS] No, Grandpa Ryu,
that's not true!

204
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,291
I don't think you're
troubling me at all!

205
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,393
What's your problem?!
Hey! Are you...

206
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,729
At some point it turned
into an argument.

207
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,198
It sounds like Apis is the
only one who's arguing.

208
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,433
Listen to her.

209
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,034
Should we...?

210
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,877
A... ship?

211
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,081
It looks like one, but
something's weird about it.

212
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:13,399
Whoa! Awesome! Hey,
Nami, do you see this?!

213
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,102
Yes. But I don't believe it!

214
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,237
Watch this! Help!

215
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,939
[chuckles]

216
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,946
[NAMI, USOPP scream]

217
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,649
[MARINE L]
What the‐‐?

218
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,817
[LT. COMMANDER]
What's going on?!

219
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,152
[MARINE K]
The ship...

220
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,787
[MARINE J]
It just...

221
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,922
It vanished!

222
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,924
Are we seeing things?

223
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,159
Hey! What just happened?!

224
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,762
How'd they disappear like that?!

225
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,264
[MARINE L]
I‐I have no idea, Sir!

226
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,366
Drop anchor!

227
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,434
Yes, Sir!

228
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,202
All ships are to stand by
until further orders!

229
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:50,936
Sir!

230
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,105
[ERIC]
Continue moving forward.

231
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,206
Are you mad?!

232
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,009
There's no telling what's
in those waters up ahead.

233
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,811
No!

234
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,346
That again?

235
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,820
Have your men prepare
a small craft for me.

236
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,356
You mean... you're actually...?

237
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,859
That's right.
I'm going after them.

238
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,547
What gives? It's just fog.

239
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,484
From the way Nami was screaming,
I thought we were in danger.

240
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,419
[NAMI]
What in the world is going on?

241
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,188
[USOPP] Can somebody
please explain to me

242
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,823
what just happened?

243
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,925
I mean, our own ship
was in front of us,

244
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,527
but somehow we passed
straight through it, right?

245
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,163
This stuff's so thick
I can't see a thing!

246
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,166
[USOPP] It was almost like a‐‐
Well, a mirage...

247
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,037
That's it! A mirage! I remember
reading about it once!

248
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,406
When warmer air in the sky
collides with cooler air

249
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:04,443
near the ocean's surface,
it can create mirages at sea.

250
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,956
What about this?
Is this a mirage too?

251
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,226
Ah! What's the deal with
this stupid ocean?!

252
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,527
[BOTH yelp]

253
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,567
Dammit! Thanks for
knockin' me over!

254
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,369
We didn't do it
on purpose, jerk!

255
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,937
It's the storm's fault!

256
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,205
[NAMI]
Sanji! Zoro!

257
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,541
Quit fighting and raise
the sails! Hurry up!

258
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,476
[SANJI]
Yes, Nami dear!

259
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,111
You'll be safer inside.

260
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,047
No! I have to stay out
here with Grandpa Ryu!

261
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,082
[ZORO]
Don't be an idiot!

262
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,216
It's too dangerous for you
to be out in this storm!

263
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,388
[APIS] I just can't leave him
alone in this! I can't!

264
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,823
[ZORO]
See?!

265
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,560
[ZORO] Now get in there
and shut up, kid!

266
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,402
Get moving.

267
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,071
If we keep drifting, that
lightning's gonna hit us!

268
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,910
[LUFFY]
It almost seems like the ocean's

269
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:15,114
trying to push the ship back
from something, but what?

270
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,119
[APIS]
Grandpa Ryu!

271
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,654
Hold on!

272
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:25,257
We'll get you out of this
storm as soon as we c‐‐ Ah!

273
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,942
Zoro!

274
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,454
Wh‐What?! Grandpa Ryu,
what are you saying?!

275
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:59,458
No! We will not let you
go to save ourselves!

276
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,193
[inaudible]

277
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:07,566
We're going to find your
nest like I promised!

278
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,469
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum...

279
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,204
...Lasso!

280
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,072
[gasps]

281
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,407
[SANJI]
Nami! I see a light over there!

282
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,543
[NAMI] That must be
the eye of the storm!

283
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,011
[USOPP]
Guys, do you see that?!

284
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,379
There's an island
below the light!

285
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,581
Then that's where
we're headed! Come on!

286
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,018
Luffy!

287
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,720
[LUFFY]
Don't worry, I got 'em!

288
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,655
We're gonna take him
to the Dragons' Nest,

289
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,490
just like you said, okay?!

290
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,925
[APIS]
Okay!

291
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,201
[NAMI]
An island hidden by a mirage

292
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,603
and surrounded by stormy seas.

293
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,674
Well, that certainly explains
why no one's ever found it.

294
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:53,712
It's not lost anymore though.
Now that we found it.

295
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,348
[LUFFY] Looks more like a
castle that sank into the ocean

296
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,284
instead of an island,
if you ask me.

297
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,022
[USOPP]
Whoa! Check out that stonework!

298
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,024
It actually looks like a dragon!

299
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,026
You know, I betcha those
Millennial Dragons

300
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,627
built this place themselves!

301
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,762
[LUFFY]
Wow!

302
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,264
I never knew dragons were
so good at building stuff.

303
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,532
[SANJI]
They're not, you morons!

304
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,402
It's pretty obvious that
humans built this place!

305
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,270
[ZORO]
Well, whatever. Who cares?

306
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,471
[LUFFY]
Yeah! Who cares?!

307
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,939
We made it to Lost Island!

308
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,647
No signs of life.

309
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,150
I wonder if anyone
lives here anymore.

310
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,752
Looks like this place has
been reclaimed by nature.

311
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,722
Does anyone know where
the Dragons' Nest could be?

312
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,290
[APIS]
Hey!

313
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,427
Grandpa Ryu! Hey!
I'm talking to you!

314
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,229
Jeez! We're on the island
with the Dragons' Nest!

315
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,766
Would you wake up and
tell us where it is?!

316
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,801
Mm?

317
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,305
[LUFFY]
What'd he say?

318
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,341
Well, he said he's not sure.

319
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,177
But he said that this place
might not even be

320
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,745
the actual Lost Island.

321
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:00,612
What?

322
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,181
You can't be serious.

323
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,615
So we went through
that freaky mirage

324
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,651
and that storm for nothing?!

325
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,188
[LUFFY]
Hey, Apis!

326
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,089
See that?

327
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,457
If the Dragons' Nest
is on the island,

328
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,425
I bet we could spot it
from up there!

329
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,693
Right!

330
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,795
We can't see anything down here,
so why don't we go take a look?

331
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,696
What do you say?

332
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,464
Yeah!

333
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,300
Great! Let's go!

334
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,539
Agh! It's not fair.

335
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,874
We men have to do all the work

336
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,542
while Nami gets to
take a stroll!

337
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,377
She should be back
here pushing with us!

338
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,378
[NAMI]
Hey back there!

339
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,547
Less caterwauling and
more dragon‐hauling!

340
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,616
[USOPP] Sure, that's
easy for you to say!

341
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,618
[SANJI]
Would you shut up and push?!

342
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,387
Nami's so gorgeous when
she's ordering us around!

343
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,889
[USOPP]
Oh, brother!

344
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,867
[NAMI]
It's a city.

345
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,804
Whoa, check it out.

346
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,740
It looks all abandoned
and broken down.

347
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,309
Do you guys think people
really used to live here?

348
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,377
[ZORO]
Of course.

349
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,578
Who else do you think lived
in all these houses?

350
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,515
[USOPP] Well, why did they leave
then, and where did they go?

351
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,516
[SANJI]
Who knows?

352
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,251
Maybe they just found a
better island to live on

353
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,319
and moved away or something.

354
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:20,592
[APIS]
It's a Millennial Dragon emblem!

355
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,427
I wonder if the children
who lived here

356
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,731
played with dragons like
I do with Grandpa Ryu.

357
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,667
Hi! Do you know if
there's a place here

358
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,537
where dragons might nest?

359
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,905
Hey! Apis!

360
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,441
Come on, you don't
wanna get left behind!

361
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,176
Guess what!

362
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,344
I was just talking to the birds

363
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,712
and they told me
there's a building

364
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,447
with a dragon emblem on it.

365
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,448
What?

366
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,616
Really?!

367
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,853
It could be the Dragons' Nest!
What are we waiting for?!

368
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,927
[LUFFY] Hey, Nami!
Are you comin' or what?!

369
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,796
Uh... Of course! Wait up!

370
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,378
[LUFFY]
Heave.

371
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,650
Please tell me we don't
have to push anymore!

372
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,722
[APIS] Thank you so much
for showing us the way!

373
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,057
[SANJI]
Wow, what do you know?

374
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,092
We traveled a lot further
than I thought.

375
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,994
[APIS]
Thank you all so very much.

376
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,896
Yeah, nice work, guys.

377
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,468
[NAMI] That painting must be
the dragon emblem, huh?

378
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,570
[LUFFY]
Yep. Guess so.

379
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,340
Wait. This little building's
the Dragons' Nest?

380
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,574
This is it?

381
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,509
Even if it is, where's the door?

382
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,778
How we supposed
to get inside it?

383
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,447
The door's right there!

384
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,617
Ugh! No, it's not!
There's no handle or keyhole!

385
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,020
If it's a door, how are we
supposed to open it, stupid?!

386
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,462
Hey!

387
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,365
Apis, that pendant of yours.

388
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,633
You mean it's a‐‐?

389
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,370
So it's a key that opens the
door to the Dragons' Nest, huh?

390
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,547
[APIS]
I...

391
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,719
I can't reach it!

392
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,055
Heh! That's 'cause
you're so short, silly!

393
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,556
[APIS]
Yeah, so?!

394
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,726
Here, let me do it.

395
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,395
Let's see.

396
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,063
Uh. Uh‐oh.

397
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,531
[yelps]

398
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,407
[ALL screaming]

399
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,732
[USOPP] Um. Hey, guys?
We're still alive, right?

400
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,101
[ZORO]
Well, sure feels that way.

401
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,537
[SANJI] Who was it again
that claimed to have a key

402
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,005
that would open the door for us?

403
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,574
[chuckles nervously]

404
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:23,742
[LUFFY]
Here.

405
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,948
Well, we didn't come in
the front door, but we're in.

406
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,118
So it all worked out.

407
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:37,122
Yeah, but just what
is this place?

408
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,525
Hey. Up there. Look.

409
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,968
What is that?

410
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,918
<i>♪All that's in my</i>
<i>heart confuses me,</i>

411
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,054
<i>I cannot understand,</i>

412
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,089
<i>As I face what I must do,</i>

413
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,992
<i>I'll say goodbye</i>
<i>and squeeze your hand.</i>

414
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,627
<i>I'll set sail alone,</i>

415
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,930
<i>But always know</i>
<i>I'm gonna keep you near,</i>

416
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,599
<i>As I drift away,</i>

417
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:24,569
<i>I pray you watch me</i>
<i>as I disappear.</i>

418
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,812
<i>As I watch the sunrise,</i>
<i>I began to wonder,</i>

419
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:38,517
<i>What could be the reason,</i>
<i>It's so hot inside.</i>

420
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,852
<i>No answer has come,</i>

421
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,923
<i>But I can't get away</i>
<i>from what's true,</i>

422
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:49,761
<i>It's because of you...</i>

423
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,197
<i>Show me how to</i>
<i>catch those feelings,</i>

424
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,766
<i>Get 'em to come back to me,</i>

425
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,201
<i>I'll do what I must,</i>

426
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,704
<i>Because they're</i>
<i>everything I wanna be.</i>

427
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,706
<i>Wrap these arms around my dreams</i>

428
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,676
<i>And pull 'em back</i>
<i>from yesterday,</i>

429
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,678
<i>If I'm holding hands with you,</i>

430
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:10,048
<i>I'm sure that we</i>
<i>can make the way.♪</i>

431
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,826
[USOPP] Hey! Is this place
really Lost Island or what?!

432
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,562
[NAMI] See! Look at that!
This could only mean‐‐

433
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,129
[ZORO]
Look out!

434
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,130
[SANJI]
That nutjob!

435
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,232
He actually followed us
all the way here, huh?!

436
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,901
[LUFFY] All right, let's fight!
You, too, Zoro!

437
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,736
[ZORO] Just go!
I'll take care of this guy!

438
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,005
[NAMI] Oh, no, look!
Now there's a huge armada!

439
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,740
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

440
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,244
"Showdown in the Ruins!
Tense Zoro vs. Eric!"

441
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,813
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
