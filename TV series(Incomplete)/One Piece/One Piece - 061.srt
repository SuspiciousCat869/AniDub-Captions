00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:19,619
[GOLD ROGER]
Destiny... Fate... Dreams...

2
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,290
These unstoppable ideals are
held deep in the heart of man...

3
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,727
As long as there are people
who seek freedom in this life,

4
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,230
these things shall not
vanish from the earth!

5
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,573
<i>People tell me</i>
<i>my head's in the clouds</i>

6
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:41,808
<i>I don't care what they say</i>

7
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,643
<i>because I'm dreamin' of you</i>

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,613
<i>You are the treasure I've found</i>

9
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,449
<i>So bright, so bold,</i>
<i>yet so elusive</i>

10
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,985
<i>It's hard to look away,</i>

11
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,988
<i>even though it's blinding me</i>

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,489
<i>There are no words to describe</i>

13
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,558
<i>how I feel inside</i>

14
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,961
<i>I'm really, really stuck</i>
<i>on you whoa, whoa!</i>

15
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,596
<i>I have to follow my dreams</i>

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,964
<i>however crazy they seem</i>

17
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:08,435
<i>And I won't stop 'til</i>
<i>I get there, you will see</i>

18
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,602
<i>You're all I need</i>

19
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,938
<i>to have the strength to believe</i>

20
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:17,644
<i>Believe in Wonderland!</i>

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,015
<i>I'm gonna follow my dreams,</i>

22
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,817
<i>however crazy they seem</i>

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,318
<i>I'm gonna share them with you,</i>

24
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,953
<i>a love so true</i>

25
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:30,490
<i>You're all I want,</i>

26
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,959
<i>Live how we want to!</i>

00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,594
<i>There is no limit to us,</i>

28
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:35,995
<i>we have the power of love</i>

29
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,365
<i>And we don't wanna</i>
<i>live ordinary lives</i>

30
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,836
<i>We have the chance</i>
<i>to live in paradise</i>

31
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:50,610
<i>Believe in Wonderland!</i>

32
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,351
Hey...! I can see the
"mystery mountain"!

33
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,787
[USOPP]
I can't see the top!

34
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,323
It's taller than the clouds!

35
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,792
Oh, wow! Awesome...!

36
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,794
It's bigger than I thought.

37
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,536
I've gotta be dreaming!

38
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,338
It's impossible...

39
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,307
The ocean really is
flowing up the mountain!

40
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:25,812
[LUFFY]
...Balloon!

41
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,421
[USOPP, SANJI]
We made it!

42
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,871
We're not in the clouds,
we're above them!

43
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,687
[NAMI]
Now we just follow it down...

44
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,956
Whoa!

45
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:10,790
I can see it!

46
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,526
The greatest sea
in the whole world!

47
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,695
The Grand Line!

48
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,063
Let's go!

49
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,769
[LUFFY]
"The First Line of Defense?

50
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,438
The Giant Whale Laboon Appears!"

51
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,955
[SANJI]
Whoa...! This is great!!

52
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,824
[chuckles]

53
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:49,562
[NAMI squeals]

54
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:54,634
[distant loud groan]

55
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,603
Did you guys just
hear something?

56
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,738
Huh...? What's that?

57
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,740
[ZORO] That groaning sound,
didn't you hear it...

58
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,809
[NAMI]
It was probably just the wind!

59
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,678
At this speed everything
sounds distorted!

60
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:11,017
[loud groaning]

61
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,619
What was that?

62
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,021
[SANJI]
Nami! I see a mountain up ahead!

63
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,190
What? That's impossible...

64
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,759
[SANJI] But it's right
there! I can see it!

65
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,595
Who cares...?! Go!!

66
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,597
[NAMI] After we pass
the Twin Capes up ahead,

67
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,866
there should be
nothing but ocean!

68
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,701
Hmm?

69
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:37,110
[CREW]
Aaaaah!

70
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:38,611
[LUFFY]
It's a black wall!!

71
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:39,545
[NAMI]
No, it's not!!

72
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,180
[ZORO]
Then, what is it?!

73
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,516
[USOPP]
It's a whale!!

74
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,886
[roars]

75
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,688
[USOPP]
What are we gonna do?!

76
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,522
[LUFFY]
Should we fight?

77
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,790
[NAMI] Idiot!
How are we supposed

78
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,824
to fight a 100‐ton whale?!

79
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,626
[USOPP] B‐B‐B‐B‐But, we
h‐h‐have to do something!

80
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,862
Our path is blocked!
How do we escape?!

81
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,730
Calm down!

82
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,300
If this creature looks
like a giant wall to us,

83
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,068
we must be a spec!

84
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:02,902
That's right...!

85
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,304
It's highly possible
that this thing

86
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,471
isn't even aware
that we're here!

87
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,474
[ZORO] We'll run right into
it unless we change course!

88
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,711
Look... We can
get by on the left!

89
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,813
Port...! Hard to port!

90
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,048
The rudder's broken!

91
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,717
[ZORO]
Do something! Anything!

92
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,085
Wait...! I know!

93
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,154
This'll work! It has to!

94
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:22,588
Hey!

95
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,157
Luffy, what're you doing?!

96
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,532
[USOPP]
This is pointless!

97
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,067
The ship's not gonna turn!

98
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,667
[ZORO]
Dammit!

99
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,269
[SANJI]
Don't give up!

100
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,680
[NAMI]
Is this the end?!

101
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,190
[USOPP, ZORO, NAMI, SANJI]
The cannon?!

102
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,192
[LUFFY]
Done...

103
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,796
Someone's coming out.

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,602
We're screwed...

105
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,204
This is it...

106
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,373
Auuuugh!!

107
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,275
Hey, that was my special seat!

108
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,398
Damn!

109
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,599
Let's get out of here
before it's too late!

110
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,734
[USOPP] Someone mind telling
me what the heck is going on?!

111
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,002
[SANJI] It's so big
that the cannon ball

112
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:43,936
didn't even make it flinch

113
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,005
That or his reaction
time's really slow!

114
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,640
[ZORO] Who cares?!
At least we're alive!

115
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:52,812
[roars]

116
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,081
[SANJI]
Aaaah! My ears...

117
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,949
[USOPP]
Paddle! Just paddle!!

118
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,284
[ZORO]
We have to get away from here...

119
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,290
[gasps]

120
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,358
[NAMI]
Luffy?

121
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,326
[LUFFY] You think you
can break my special seat

122
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,128
and get away with it?!

123
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,798
[LUFFY]
Take this!

124
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,202
[CREW]
You moron!!

125
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,813
[LUFFY]
I'm not through with you!

126
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,147
There's a lot more
where that came‐‐

127
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,116
Shut up before you kill us!

128
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,026
[NAMI]
Please! No!

129
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,300
[screams]

130
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,367
Aaaah!

131
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,143
[NAMI]
Luffy!

132
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,211
[SANJI]
Luffy!

133
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,819
[LUFFY]
I'm not gonna die!!

134
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:15,194
Auugh!

135
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:40,286
[pants]

136
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,088
Ah, man...

137
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,724
Everyone's been swallowed whole!

138
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,261
Rrrg! Hey, you!
Can you hear me?!

139
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,429
Spit 'em out!
I want my friends...

140
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,064
Damn you!

141
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,201
[LUFFY] Where do ya think
you're going, ya jerk?!

142
00:08:56,035 --> 00:09:01,807
You give them back
right now you whale!

143
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,808
Listen, ya big boat!

144
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,377
I'm not gonna ask again!

145
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,046
Stop sinking...! I mean it!

146
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,448
My friends and me are
on an important adventure...!

147
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,217
I can't lose 'em!

148
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,453
Give them back!!

149
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,476
[NAMI]
So... What do you think?

150
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,078
[ZORO]
I don't know what to think...

151
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,947
[SANJI]
Is this even real?

152
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,181
[USOPP jibbers]

153
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,817
[SANJI] Because I know exactly
what I saw and what I felt.

154
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,286
We were swallowed by the whale.

155
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,423
[USOPP]
Is this a dream?

156
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,426
[ZORO] Yeah, I'd say that's a
fair guess.

157
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,099
Then what's with this island?

158
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,100
And the house?

159
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,802
Illusions.

160
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,142
[NAMI]
Umm... That's look likes...

161
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:14,113
[NAMI, USOPP]
A Great King Squid!!

162
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,636
Looks like someone's home.

163
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,804
Let's hope it's a person.

164
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,073
I've had it...! Let's go!

165
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,242
Giant squids,
guys with harpoons,

166
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,144
and where's Luffy?

167
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,146
Yeah, where is he?

168
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,881
Uhh...

169
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,384
Wha? I don't know
much about whales,

170
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,920
but since when do they have
doors and lighted hallways?!

171
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,724
[CROCUS]
A ship...?

172
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:02,194
Wh‐Wh‐Wh‐Wh‐Wh‐Whoa!!
We should fire our cannon there!

173
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:02,862
Now!

174
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:03,496
No...

175
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,498
Hold on a sec.

176
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:41,600
Uh...

177
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,102
[SANJI]
It's a...

178
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,205
Flower?

179
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:48,641
No it's...

180
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,775
...a person...

181
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,110
Are ya sure?

182
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,579
[NAMI] That old man just
killed a Great King Squid

183
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,647
with one shot!

184
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,282
[SANJI]
The question is, why...?

185
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,917
Was he trying to save us?

186
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,752
Or is he just fishing?

187
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,948
[SANJI]
You gonna say anything?

188
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,320
Hey, you wanna fight,
we'll fight!

189
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,989
We got cannons back
here, you bastard!

190
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,336
[CROCUS] You try it,
and someone's going to die.

191
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,706
[USOPP,NAMI squeal]

192
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,142
Yeah...? And who's that?

193
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,209
[CROCUS]
Me, of course.

194
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,778
'Scuse me?!

195
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,345
You‐‐!

196
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,679
Ease up there, bud.

197
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,715
The old bastard's mocking us!

198
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,185
There's a couple things
we need to know...

199
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,688
Where are we? And who are you?

200
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,899
[CROCUS] You've got
some nerve stranger...

201
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,400
It's only polite
to introduce yourself

202
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,037
before asking a question
of someone you've just met.

203
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,375
Uh. Heh. All right, fair enough.
I'll go first. My name‐‐

204
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,376
[CROCUS]
If you must know,

205
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,044
my name is Crocus,

206
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,847
and I'm the lighthouse
keeper of the Twin Capes...

207
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,982
I'm 71‐and‐a‐half years old...

208
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:37,583
Gemini.

209
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,818
I'll kill him! I swear it!

210
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:39,752
[SANJI]
Calm down.

211
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,154
[CROCUS] You'd like
to know where we are,

212
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,356
but your rude behavior
leaves me disinclined

213
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,358
to accommodate your curiosity,

214
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:50,863
except that you are trespassing
on my private resort.

215
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,832
Besides, I'd think
it's pretty obvious,

216
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,067
seeing as how you were eaten.

217
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,937
[USOPP] So you're saying that
we were swallowed by the whale,

218
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,706
but since when does a whale's
stomach have clouds in it?

219
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:01,740
Wait a minute!

220
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,709
If we've been eaten,
what's gonna happen to us?!

221
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,778
I don't wanna be digested!

222
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,421
[CREW]
Stop doing that!!

223
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,422
[CROCUS]
What's wrong?

224
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,290
Haven't you ever heard
of a "running gag"?

225
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,425
That was a gag?!

226
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,393
[CROCUS]
The exit is over there.

227
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,428
[CREW]
We can get out?!

228
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,464
[NAMI] Okay, even if
I believed a whale's belly

229
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,433
could have an exit door,

230
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,902
nothing's there but sky!

231
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,871
Something's not right here...

232
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,273
Wait... Look at the sky...

233
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,076
Those seagulls...
Nothing's moving.

234
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,110
They're painted on!

235
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,046
It's a giant mural inside
the whale's stomach!

236
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,914
[NAMI]
Huh?

237
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:42,948
[CROCUS]
Call it a doctor's playful mind.

238
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,985
You're not making any sense,
you crazy old fool!

239
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,453
[ZORO]
Easy. Don't let him get to you.

240
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,787
Yeah, just shut up...

241
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:49,889
Nami...

242
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,490
If that is an exit,
then we need to get to it...

243
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,125
Agreed.

244
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,398
[SANJI]
Aw, great! What now?!

245
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,401
It's begun.

246
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,403
Look!

247
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,304
That's no island!

248
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,173
It's some kind of ship!
It's made of iron!

249
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,275
Yeah, of course!

250
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,477
'Cause we're floating
on a sea of gastric acid!

251
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,445
[SANJI] That means a
wooden ship wouldn't fare well

252
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,314
if it stayed here too long.

253
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,017
Hey! What's with
this freaky whale?!

254
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,152
Answer me old man!

255
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,354
He's very angry.

256
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,124
These aftershocks
are a result of him

257
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,993
hitting his head
against the Red Line.

258
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,003
What?!

259
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,004
That explains it...

260
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,840
Why he had such deep
scars on his forehead.

261
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,343
Not to mention all
the strange howling...

262
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,844
Why's he do it?

263
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,213
[NAMI]
It's because he's suffering!

264
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,121
[USOPP]
It's all starting to make sense!

265
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,190
So, what's the geezer up to?

266
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,358
[NAMI]
More than likely he's trying

267
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,194
to kill the whale
from the inside...

268
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,495
It's time.

269
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,364
What a despicable
way to kill something.

270
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,199
Okay, we've solved
the mystery of the whale.

271
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,367
Now how about we find a way out

272
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,536
of its belly before
it digests us.

273
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,371
[SANJI] We have no right
to judge the old man,

274
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,173
nor do we need
to save the whale.

275
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,908
What we need to
do is focus on how

276
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,344
to get the hell out of here...

277
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,191
[USOPP]
We're never gonna get anywhere

278
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,060
if the waves keep
surging like this!

279
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,062
How can we escape
if we can't even move?!

280
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,398
[ZORO] Our only choice is
to paddle! Take the oars!

281
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,566
[NAMI]
Whatever it takes!

282
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,334
We have to find
Luffy right away!

283
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,535
[ZORO]
I know he's outside!

284
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,338
I caught a glimpse of him
flying out of the whale's mouth!

285
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,442
[NAMI]
That old guy just jumped in!

286
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,377
Huh?

287
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,911
[ZORO]
Is he insane?

288
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,047
The acid will eat him alive.

289
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,891
Aaaah!

290
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,596
So dizzy! I'm gonna hurl.

291
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,545
[LUFFY]
Hey, that's weird...

292
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,448
The whale's got
a river inside it, too?

293
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,162
[MR. 9]
Things are looking up, my dear!

294
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,431
We've been successful so far.

295
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,466
Listen carefully,
Miss Wednesday...

296
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,002
Behind these doors
lie the beast's stomach,

297
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,137
and that troublesome
geezer as well.

298
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,474
He must be eliminated
before he can interfere again.

299
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,510
Remember...
it's all for the whale.

300
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,312
Indeed, Mr. 9...

301
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,114
This whale's a precious
creature,

302
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:05,517
and one that holds the sweet
promise of life for our town.

303
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,488
Guys! Crocus just resurfaced!

304
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,290
[ZORO]
Look, forget about the old guy!

305
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:14,660
Our focus should be on finding
a way to open these doors.

306
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,028
All right...

307
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,198
Here's the plan baby.
"Three... Two... One..."

308
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,667
Then we kick through the doors.

309
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,502
Roger that, Mr. 9.

310
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,003
I'm ready any time.

311
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:28,273
[distant scream growing louder]

312
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,042
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
What is that voice, Mr. 9?

313
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,044
[MR. 9]
I don't know, Miss Wednesday.

314
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,180
[LUFFY]
I can't stop!!

315
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,323
They're back...

316
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:51,196
[MR. 9] Not good! We're
gonna fall into gastric acid!!

317
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,031
[ZORO]
Luffy?

318
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,167
[LUFFY]
Zoro! Is everyone okay?

319
00:18:56,668 --> 00:19:00,205
So, um... I could use a hand!

320
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,310
Looks like Luffy's not alone...

321
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,412
Who do you suppose the
two weirdoes are with him?

322
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,648
[NAMI] Where'd that
old geezer disappear to?!

323
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,917
[ZORO] Forget him...
We need to save Luffy!

324
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,003
[CROCUS]
You've got to stop it, Laboon.

325
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,939
You can't afford to beat
yourself up any more...

326
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,275
There's only a tiny
amount of sedative left.

327
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,045
And until I can make some
more you'll have to make nice.

328
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,248
I've told you before‐‐

329
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,784
that wall divides
the world's oceans.

330
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,120
It doesn't matter how
many times you hit it...

331
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,021
It won't break.

332
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,057
Not even for someone
as mighty as you.

333
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,029
[NAMI]
I don't claim to speak whale,

334
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,797
but it seems to
have calmed down a bit.

335
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,766
[ZORO]
Seems that way.

336
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,070
[ZORO] Now, we saved
your lives for the time being,

337
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,872
but you'd better talk
and make it quick!

338
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:10,309
Mr. 9, these
heathens are pirates!

339
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,111
Yes, that's painfully
obvious, Miss Wednesday.

340
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,147
But, if we speak to their
humanity and compassion,

341
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,217
they should understand our
plight... Maybe.

342
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,886
[CROCUS]
You parasites are still here?!

343
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,989
I grow weary of this,
and for the last time!

344
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,924
As long as I draw breath,

345
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:30,162
you will not lay a single,
harmful finger on Laboon!

346
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,798
He's back again.

347
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:33,966
[LUFFY]
Who's the old guy?

348
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,134
[MISS WEDNESDAY laughs]

349
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,503
You can't bully us into
abandoning our mission.

350
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,138
[MR. 9] We were sent
here to hunt this whale,

351
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,307
and that's exactly
what we're going to do!

352
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,077
And this time,
we won't let you interfere!

353
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,813
We're about to give
this whale a new blowhole!

354
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:48,914
Fire, baby!

355
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,315
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
Roger!

356
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,929
He jumped straight
into the line of fire!

357
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,932
Did he just... Was he
protecting the whale?!

358
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:11,303
[MISS WEDNESDAY laughs]
Your defiance is pointless!

359
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,338
[MR. 9]
Go ahead... Waste your time!

360
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,173
But, make no mistake...

361
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,542
That hulking beast will
provide food for our town!

362
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:23,882
[MR. 9, MISS WEDNESDAY laugh]

363
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,284
What's going on?

364
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,359
[USOPP]
Um... What was that for?

365
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,396
I just... wanted to hit 'em.

366
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,207
[CROCUS]
I thank you for saving my life,

367
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,309
though I must ask‐‐

368
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,176
Why did you do it?

369
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,145
[LUFFY]
I wasn't trying to save you...

370
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,081
There was just something
about those two I didn't like.

371
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,215
[CROCUS]
Oh...

372
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,051
[NAMI] Okay, I think it's
time we got some answers.

373
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,319
Who are these guys?

374
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,521
And how did you
end up inside this whale?

375
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,656
[CROCUS] These two are
thugs from a nearby town,

376
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,757
looking for whale meat...

377
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,193
If they caught him, Laboon
could feed the townspeople

378
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,029
for at least 2 or 3 years, easy.

379
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,264
All they're concerned with

380
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,933
is filling their
fat, greedy bellies!

381
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,001
Laboon?

382
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,669
That's the whale's name.

383
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,339
He's a unique and
magnificent creature...

384
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,442
An island whale one of the
largest species in the world

385
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:26,111
that can only be found
in the West Blue...

386
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,181
I won't allow them to
slaughter him for food.

387
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,515
It's a shame that
he's stuck here

388
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,684
so far away from his domain...

389
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,953
You see, there's a reason
he keeps hitting himself

390
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:38,423
on the Red Line and
howling at Reverse Mountain.

391
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,192
[NAMI]
There is?

392
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,427
Yes... To put it one way...

393
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:46,264
Inside Laboon's body
beats the heart of a human...

394
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,700
He has most impatiently awaited

395
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:53,105
and is eternally devoted to
a certain band of pirates...

396
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,377
