1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,158
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:42,095
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

39
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:45,331
and everything else
the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:50,336
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,238
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

42
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,339
You can have it!

43
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,943
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

44
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,712
Now you just have to find it!

45
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,383
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

46
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,319
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

47
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,589
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

48
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,491
So you've already
given up, huh?

49
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,126
How can you say that?

50
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,163
That isn't the
captain I used to know.

51
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,032
Those aren't
the words of the man

52
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,134
who's gonna be
King of the Pirates!

53
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,636
What a bunch of fools!

54
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,173
Jiro's risking his life
and it's all because of me!

55
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,711
[PUZZLE yelling]

56
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,182
[LUFFY]
The Return of the Phoenix!

57
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,319
The Dream of the
Pirate Flag Sworn to a Friend.

58
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,265
Hurry up!
We gotta get our flag back!

59
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,068
Just leave it to me!

60
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,069
Come on! It's this way!

61
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,270
[USOPP] Yeah! Let's go!

62
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,439
Leave it to him, huh?

63
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,407
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

64
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,546
[USOPP]
Yahh!

65
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,082
Hey, wait a minute.
Where the hell are we?

66
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,621
[USOPP] This doesn't look right.

67
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,222
[ZORO] Gimme a sec. Don't panic.

68
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,490
No, I'm totally gonna panic!

69
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,325
Luffy's gonna kill us, Zoro!

70
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,159
[ZORO] Here!

71
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,127
A-ha!

72
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,432
Prepare to die, you fat,
steam-blowing bastard!

73
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,137
[ZORO]
Come on! This way!

74
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,605
[USOPP] Yeah!

75
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:37,744
--[ZORO] Over here!

76
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,778
--[USOPP] Really? Again?
--[ZORO] Over here!

77
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,082
[ZORO and USOPP coughing]

78
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,618
All right!

79
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,754
Looks like we've found
some high quality flour!

80
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,522
This is hopeless.

81
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,591
All right, I think I've
finally got my bearings now.

82
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,359
You've been guessing
this whole time?

83
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,560
Look, if you don't
know which way to go,

84
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,162
then just say so, dammit!

85
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,231
All this running around
is getting us nowhere.

86
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,466
Don't you remember anything
about where that room is?

87
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,701
Seriously!

88
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,137
We've gotta get that flag back
and fast, or Luffy's gonna--

89
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,840
[LUFFY] Hey! Gimme back my flag!

90
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,375
Crap, it's too late!

91
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,618
[CAMPACINO] I'd like to
welcome you to Lovely Land!

92
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,555
It's an honor to have a 300
million Berry bounty with us.

93
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,658
[LUFFY]
Huh? This is Lovely Land?

94
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,160
[CAMPACINO] That's right.

95
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,094
[LUFFY] Looks dumb.

96
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,562
[ACCINO FAMILY exclaiming]

97
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,733
Gahh!

98
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:34,600
[USOPP] Nami!

99
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:37,103
He's... here! He's here!

100
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,438
We're screwed!

101
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,673
Great. So much for that plan.

102
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,608
Hey! Zoro, where ya goin'?

103
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,744
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to get our flag back!

104
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:45,611
It's this way!

105
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,480
Leave it to me!

106
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,349
[SANJI] Have fun
being lost for eternity.

107
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,250
[ZORO] Shut up, stupid cook!

108
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,353
[ZORO yelling, falling]

109
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:56,856
[NAMI] Robin!

110
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,425
[SANJI] Beautiful Robin!

111
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,493
Oh, here you are!

112
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,762
[SANJI] That cola delivery
really helped us out!

113
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:06,232
Another brilliant
idea as usual, my love!

114
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,133
But what's the deal here?

115
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,634
It seems like you're
the only one of us

116
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,536
who's getting
the royal treatment.

117
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,638
Don't you think that's
just a little strange?

118
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,242
I think the bigger issue
is that Luffy's arrived.

119
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,810
And he doesn't seem very happy.

120
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:18,678
Robin's got a point!

121
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,847
We're too late!
It's over! We're doomed!

122
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,883
No, there's still
something left we can do.

123
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,885
This is Luffy
we're talking about!

124
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,820
I'm sure we could
just trick him!

125
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:28,921
Yeah, she's right!

126
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,456
I mean, he is a moron.

127
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,891
[FRANKY] Sure is! Good call!

128
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,025
That's true.

129
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,228
I'm not even sure how he
discovered the flag was missing

130
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,863
in the first place.
It's a mystery.

131
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,899
But the fact is: he didn't
actually see it being stolen.

132
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,801
Right! That's why
we still have a chance

133
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,336
to pull this off.

134
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,538
I know exactly
where our flag is.

135
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,273
Leave it to me.
I'll get it back!

136
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,408
That's awesome!

137
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,710
Robin, you're the best!

138
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,577
It was stupid to think

139
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,780
we could rely on
that idiotic Moss Head.

140
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:54,747
[ZORO]
A-ha!

141
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,748
[groans]

142
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:56,916
[ZORO]
Dammit!

143
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,684
[NAMI]
I'm counting on you, Robin!

144
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,623
All right, then.

145
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,859
Listen up, everyone.
Here's the plan.

146
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,529
Now Gum-Gum...

147
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,264
...Pistol!

148
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,303
[CAMPACINO]
Magnetic Love Bazooka!

149
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,176
And now it's time for
the Lovely Crush Attack!

150
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,715
[CAMPACINO] Love Hunter Kick!

151
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,656
When twin brothers
combine their powers

152
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:37,757
in perfect harmony,

153
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,659
nothing can stand in their way.

154
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,600
Bound by the power of magnetism,

155
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,735
and bound by brotherly love!

156
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,205
We are known as
the Love Hunters!

157
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,242
That clone move you've got
sure comes in handy.

158
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,710
We told you, we're twins!

159
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:58,978
[LUFFY]
How was I supposed to know?

160
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,214
Listen when people are talking!

161
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,516
[SALCHOW, ARBELL] Love Throw!

162
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,789
Gum-Gum...

163
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,325
Time for Magnetic Love Bazooka.

164
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,960
Followed closely by...

165
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,629
[BRINDO]
...Lovely Double Attack!

166
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,935
If their powers
come from brotherly love,

167
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,506
then our powers must come
from our red-hot steamy love.

168
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,674
Right you are, my Arbell!

169
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,580
Whoa. What's with
those kissy-faced people?

170
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,115
Luffy!

171
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,216
Hey, are you all right?

172
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,486
[LUFFY] Huh? Yep! Still
doing good. Not hungry yet.

173
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,755
Look out, guys! He's coming!

174
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,724
Hoh ke!

175
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:48,294
Stay right where you are,
my little 50 Berry bounty pet!

176
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,305
Hoh ke ke!

177
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,706
Feel like an icicle yet?

178
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,708
[CHOPPER]
I was born on a winter island.

179
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,311
This little bit of
ice means nothing to me!

180
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,813
[HOCKERA] Hoh ke ke!
That may be true for you,

181
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,048
but I don't think
you could say the same

182
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,983
for your snot-nosed little pal!

183
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,419
[CHOPPER] Jiro!

184
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,691
Hoh ke ke!

185
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,527
Hoh ke ke!

186
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,429
Hoh keeeee!

187
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,899
Dammit! That hurt, Straw Hat!

188
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,034
Stay outta this!

189
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,036
Stick to your
own fight, you got it?

190
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,704
Huh? Did I hit you?

191
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,905
I was just stretching!

192
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,006
I'm sorry. My bad.

193
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,908
You liar!
Don't play dumb with me!

194
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,977
Look, I'm not
playing dumb, okay?

195
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,646
Either way, Chopper and Jiro
don't need me to save them.

196
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,114
They're strong enough
on their own.

197
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,482
What'd you say?

198
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,685
[CHOPPER] Luffy...

199
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,820
Doctor, listen.

200
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,823
Let me down.
I wanna fight, too.

201
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,594
I wanna do my part
as a Phoenix pirate

202
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,128
to help get our flag back!

203
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,797
[CHOPPER] Well said, Jiro.

204
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,898
Is this a joke?

205
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,567
Challenged by a 50 Berry
bounty reindeer and a child?

206
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,769
You don't know what
you're getting into. Huh?

207
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,038
[CHOPPER] Rumble!

208
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,782
And Guard Point!

209
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,752
What the hell? Huh?

210
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,754
Here I come!

211
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,459
Doctor, that's... so cool!

212
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,103
My Guard Point is meant to keep
me safe from any injuries.

213
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,971
I didn't even feel that attack!

214
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,473
Dammit!

215
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,008
I'll make you an icicle yet!

216
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,643
We'll see about that!

217
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,916
Time for my Smacking
Rainy Season Splash!

218
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,087
It looks like
we got him, Doctor!

219
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,155
We sure did!

220
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,490
And it was your help
at the end that cinched it!

221
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,498
Damn those little pirate jerks!

222
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,600
So that's how
you wanna play, is it?

223
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:45,413
[whistles]

224
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,711
[distant rumbling]

225
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,079
What's that sound?

226
00:11:53,112 --> 00:12:03,422
[PENGUINS squawking]

227
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,890
The Domo Penguins?

228
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,965
[HOCKERA]
Hoh ke ke!

229
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,568
We have all sorts of trained
Domo Penguins around here,

230
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,471
including ones trained
to be savagely hungry!

231
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,606
[squawking]

232
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,474
He wasn't kidding!

233
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,576
This one here's
screaming about food!

234
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,444
Hey, wait a minute, Doctor.

235
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,546
Does that mean you
know how to speak penguin?

236
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,181
You're so awesome!

237
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,316
Telling me how awesome I am

238
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,819
doesn't make me happy or
anything, you little jerk-face!

239
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,490
I guess my 3 minutes are up!

240
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,125
[PUZZLE] Jiro!

241
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,926
[PUZZLE]
Up here!

242
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,095
You gotta run! Hurry up!

243
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,163
No way!

244
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,499
I won't give up until
I've gotten our flag back!

245
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,767
Lucky me!

246
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,503
Looks like I'll be taking your
hundred million bounty as well.

247
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,705
[whistles]

248
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,845
You think a bunch of
penguins can stop us, huh?

249
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,648
Don't let your guard down!

250
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,586
Look at Jiro.
Fighting with just a stick.

251
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,522
He's in over his head.

252
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,691
You used to act that
way yourself, Captain.

253
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,627
And it was because
of that courageous spirit

254
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,630
that Vigaro and the rest
of us followed you anywhere.

255
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,565
You were an inspiration.

256
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,569
[STANSEN] Hey! Vigaro!

257
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,037
Why didn't you stop him?

258
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,506
Out here in the
seas of the New World,

259
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,142
the other pirates are at
a completely different level.

260
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,778
You gotta convince
him to turn back!

261
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,114
[VIGARO] I have no intention
of stopping Captain Puzzle.

262
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,482
[STANSEN] What?

263
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,883
Listen to me, Stansen.

264
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,052
When we raised the flag of
the Phoenix Pirate crew

265
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,187
atop our mast,

266
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,123
didn't we make a pact to
take on any enemy in our path,

267
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,492
regardless of their strength?

268
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,593
--Yeah, but still...

269
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,527
--Captain Puzzle is the only man
--Yeah, but still...

270
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,063
I've ever truly
recognized as my captain.

271
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,032
There can be no other.

272
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,801
I'll do anything to help
him reach his dream.

273
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,904
I'll follow that man
unto my death if I have to.

274
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,674
[VIGARO] Because I know
he truly is a phoenix.

275
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,977
That he'll rise again and again,
no matter what he faces,

276
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,581
and each time, he'll be
even stronger than the last.

277
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,950
The captain that I have
pledged my life to follow

278
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,751
is just that kind of man.

279
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,691
Listen up. I still
believe in you, Puzzle.

280
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,229
You're the man who will be
King of the Pirates someday!

281
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,867
This is it--Gum-Gum Whip!

282
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,579
[PUZZLE]
I--

283
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,948
[laughing]

284
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,184
[PUZZLE] This is the flag
of the Phoenix Pirates!

285
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,921
[cheering]

286
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,890
I'm gonna be the next
King of the Pirates,

287
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,825
right after you!

288
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:53,859
We're on our way!

289
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,628
Next is The New World!

290
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,999
[yelling]

291
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,835
[PUZZLE]
I'm sorry, everyone.

292
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,303
I've been a fool.

293
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,071
A sorry excuse for a Captain

294
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,008
who couldn't even bring his best
friend's dying wish to fruition.

295
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,778
But now, you've all
brought me back to my senses.

296
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,014
Show these bounty
hunters what we're made of.

297
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,283
We'll reclaim our flag
in Vigaro's name,

298
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,219
and fly it proudly
in the winds of the New World!

299
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,854
Captain Puzzle!

300
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,599
All right, Jiro, you ready?

301
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,167
It's time to get our flag back.

302
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,802
Captain Puzzle?

303
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,604
Aye-Aye, sir! Let's go!

304
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,887
Pirate scum!

305
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,001
[PUZZLE] Leave these punks
to us, Straw Hat.

306
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,302
We'll take care of 'em!

00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,072
Welcome back, guys!

00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,206
They're all yours!

[USOPP, NAMI, SANJI, FRANKY]
Hey!

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,162
You ugly blonde turd!

00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,731
What's that guy's problem?

318
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,099
He's just jealous
'cause he don't got

what we got, baby!

I bet it sucks
to be him, huh?

321
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,137
I know, right?

322
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,741
That's it!
Now you're gonna get it!

I don't care about them!

You guys let our flag--

you puck slinging bastard?

00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,017
What was that?

328
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,919
It's not gonna be
so easy this time around.

329
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,689
Get ready! Here we come!

330
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,124
Here we come!

--[NAMI] Usopp! Come on!
--Here we come!

332
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,426
[USOPP] Right!

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,828
[ARBELL, SALCHOW]
La-lala-lala!

00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,764
Hey! Get back here now!

335
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,032
[FRANKY]
I'm gonna pound your face in!

336
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,066
[NAMI] You're gonna
regret messing with us!

337
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,868
Wait'll I get my hands on you!

338
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,002
Get back here, Usopp!

339
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,337
Luffy! Thank goodness!

340
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,471
I need you to
take those guys out

341
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,407
so we can get
past the doorway!

342
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,474
[LUFFY] Say what?

343
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,710
Why do we need to do that?

344
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,012
Oh well,
you see, it's because--

345
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,080
Listen up.

346
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,348
No matter what, we need
to keep Luffy in the dark.

347
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,818
We gotta keep him busy so Robin
has time to recover the flag.

348
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,153
Does everyone get it?

349
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,187
[FRANKY, SANJI, USOPP]
Got it!

350
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,923
See, because there's, uh--

351
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,026
Because there's a
magical barrier on the door

352
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,861
and it won't open until
you defeat all the people

353
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,263
who are out here first!

354
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,367
[LUFFY] Magic?

355
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,437
Man, they're sneaky.

356
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,771
[LUFFY] We're on it.

357
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,149
[LIL] Hello, Robin.
What are you doing?

358
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,019
Are you playing hide
and seek all by yourself?

359
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,253
Actually...

360
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,456
I was hoping that I could catch
a peek of your Papa's room.

361
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,634
Oh, I see!
You wanted to meet Papa!

362
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,865
[LIL] This path will take
us right to Papa's room.

363
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:23,168
It's not too far away.
It's a really fun place, too!

364
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,374
You like to look at pretty
flowers, too, don't you Robin?

365
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,375
I do.

366
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,343
[LIL] Thought so.

367
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,612
My big sister Arbell
used to love this place.

368
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,248
We would take walks here
together all the time,

369
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,450
but then everything
changed for the worse

370
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,953
when she married
that gross old loser.

371
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,226
Hey! Do you want
to play that game again?

372
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,261
The one where you hide
the coin in one of your hands

373
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,029
and I have to guess which one!

374
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,298
Please! Come on!

375
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,867
So, tell me, Lil.

376
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,637
Why did you tell me a lie?

377
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,339
This garden may be pretty,

378
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,575
but it isn't leading us
to your father at all, is it?

379
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,010
Am I wrong?

380
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,378
It's only fair,
don't you think?

381
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,947
Since you told me a lie, too.

382
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,283
You said you would
stay here and play with me,

383
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,386
but you're planning to leave
with your friends, aren't you?

384
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,624
Too bad, because there's
no way to escape this place.

385
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,559
You're going
to stay here with me.

386
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,896
I'm sorry I lied, but...

387
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,335
What're you doing?

388
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:34,239
If you promise to remain
my big sister forever,

389
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,042
then I promise to save you
from those plants.

390
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,945
[SANJI] I'm gonna smash
that smug expression

391
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,047
right off your face!

392
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,550
I'm not falling for the same
crap you two pulled before.

393
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,018
Is that so?

394
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,321
[SANJI]
Oh, Arbell! You're so naughty!

395
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,124
You totally fell for the
same crap she pulled before!

396
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,927
[HOCKERA] Hoh ke!
Here I come!

397
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,064
Honestly, you should
be able to handle this guy

398
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,265
on your own, right?

399
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,667
Without a doubt.

400
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,505
Fresh Fire!

401
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,673
[HOCKERA] Penalty!

402
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,176
Now Gum-Gum...

403
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,979
...Gatling!

404
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,316
[LUFFY yelling]

405
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:21,653
All right, now Gum-Gum Bazooka!

406
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,658
They sure make a mess

407
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,660
when they go flying
through the air like that.

408
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,697
[LUFFY]
It's open!

409
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,266
Brindo, no!

410
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,468
Give it up, Campacino!
It's over!

411
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,104
You don't think you can win
without your brother, do you?

412
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,205
Because the last time I checked,

413
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,507
you can't use
magnetism by yourself.

414
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,710
[CAMPACINO]
Ohohohoho!

415
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,446
And what makes you
think that's my only power?

416
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,050
What?

417
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,457
[SALCHOW, ARBELL]
Love Swing!

418
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,393
[SANJI] Did you say "lo"-augh!
Augh! Augh!

419
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,794
You idiot! Wake up!

420
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,163
You gonna let that guy
make a fool of you again?

421
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,732
Usopp, they got
the front door open!

422
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,400
Oh, that's good. Now--

423
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,072
This is bad!

424
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,607
What are we gonna do?

425
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,278
Enough!
We're wasting time here!

426
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,380
[SANJI] Nami swan!

427
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,714
Sanji, take care of the guy.

428
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,583
You can leave the girl to me.

429
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,751
[SANJI] You got it!

430
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,287
I've got just the thing
to bring you down.

431
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,122
Thunder Charge!

432
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,324
So you're going to
"bring me down", are you?

433
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,093
And on what basis are
you making such a bold claim?

434
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,495
[NAMI] Basis? Whatever.

435
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,463
Like I said, we don't
have time for this.

436
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,698
Thunder Ball!

437
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,736
We can't keep
Luffy fooled forever.

438
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,205
Thunderbolt Tempo!

439
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,277
Honey, no!

440
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,645
Didn't you hear the lady?

441
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,348
Time is a 'wasting, bud.

442
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,617
[SANJI] First Course!

443
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,086
[SANJI] Flanchet! Tendron!

444
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,422
Flanchet! Cuisseau! Jarret!

445
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,791
Man, he really had some
pent-up rage, there, didn't he?

446
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,527
When it comes to the ladies,
he's a loose cannon.

447
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:16,835
Oh wow!
That guy is freakin' huge!

448
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,675
[ACCINO]
Pshoo!

449
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,383
That must be Don Accino!

450
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,851
Why is he...

451
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,152
...so naked?

452
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,420
[JIRO, CHOPPER] What?

453
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,189
Straw Hat Luffy.

454
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,191
You and your crew of
riff-raff did a number

455
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,493
on my sons and daughters,
didn't you?

456
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,567
You tore the
Accino family apart!

457
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,569
Nobody does that to us!

458
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,405
You're the bastard
who trapped our ship

459
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,375
and stole our flag,
naked balloon guy!

460
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,176
[ACCINO] Yeah, so what?

461
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,346
What are you going to do
about it, you little brat?

462
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,814
Pshoo!

463
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,683
I'm gonna beat
the crap out of you!

464
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,352
And then I'm gonna
get our flag back!

465
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,554
[ZORO]
Yah!

466
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,589
[ZORO groans]

467
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,832
[LUFFY] This Naked
Balloon guy pisses me off!

468
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,735
Making those weird "pshoo-pshoo"
noises all the time!

469
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:24,669
[NAMI] Careful, Luffy!

470
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,937
He keeps getting hotter!

471
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,572
[LUFFY] I'm about to
finish him for good,

472
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,241
then I'll get our flag back!

473
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,275
Oh, yeah! About that...

474
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,510
[NAMI] This is bad.

475
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,511
Listen, guys!

476
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,379
We've gotta get that flag
before Luffy does!

477
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,747
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

478
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,716
The Red Hot Decisive Battle!

479
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,918
Luffy vs. The Scorching Don!

480
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,354
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
