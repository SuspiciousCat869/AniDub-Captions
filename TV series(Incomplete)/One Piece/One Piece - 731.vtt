WEBVTT

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:37.615
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:40.522
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:45.832
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.437
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:51.677
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.744 --> 00:02:53.581
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.648 --> 00:02:56.086
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:59.025
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.233
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.769
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:08.476
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:12.919
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.564
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:21.871
and targeted the Don Quixote
Family in Dressrosa.

00:03:21.938 --> 00:03:25.177
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:25.244 --> 00:03:27.782
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:30.487
[NARRATOR] In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:30.554 --> 00:03:32.358
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:32.424 --> 00:03:34.563
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives,

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.936
until at last,
only their leader remained.

00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:40.474
As the struggle continues,
the razer-sharp threads

00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:43.479
of Doflamingo's "Birdcage"
tear across Dressrosa,

00:03:43.547 --> 00:03:46.185
threatening to massacre
everyone in the kingdom.

00:03:46.252 --> 00:03:48.090
Luffy rushes to
defeat Doflamingo

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:49.258
before it is too late,

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:51.062
but exhausts his Haki
in the process,

00:03:51.128 --> 00:03:54.869
leaving his allies to
temporarily fend for themselves.

00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:58.711
Do you really think your swords

00:03:58.777 --> 00:04:00.981
can stop the cage's
movement, Sir Zoro?

00:04:01.048 --> 00:04:03.688
It isn't something that can
simply be pushed back!

00:04:03.754 --> 00:04:06.527
At the end of the day,
this is just one man's power.

00:04:06.593 --> 00:04:09.532
So there's no reason to
believe that I can't stop it!

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.304
[FRANKY]
Now. It's go time, baby!

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.375
[DWARVES]
Keep pushing!

00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:16.345
[FRANKY]
Whatcha gonna do?

00:04:16.412 --> 00:04:18.618
[DWARVES]
Push!

00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:21.256
All right, guys,
don't make me look bad!

00:04:21.323 --> 00:04:25.396
Keep pushing and
my barrier's got ya! Go!

00:04:25.463 --> 00:04:29.271
We'll do it
just like Mister Zoro!

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:34.683
Whoa! It can't be!

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.553
Trafalgar Law!

00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:41.329
Is Straw Hat gonna
get his Haki back or not?

00:04:41.396 --> 00:04:43.233
Yeah. It's just...

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.869
He said he needed ten minutes

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:48.510
and now we've got about
three and a half to go.

00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:51.382
I'll take him under
my care from here.

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.622
Let's go. Every second counts.

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:01.435
[MANSHERRY]
You can do it, Dressrosa!

00:05:01.503 --> 00:05:02.972
Don't give up!

00:05:16.967 --> 00:05:19.873
[TOWNSMAN A] The Birdcage
is closing in on us!

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:25.216
[TOWNSMAN B]
Huh? Whoa.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.120
[TOWNSMAN C]
Hey, you're walking again!

00:05:27.187 --> 00:05:28.389
[TOWNSMAN B]
Uh, yeah.

00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:29.525
[TOWNSMAN C]
What happened?

00:05:29.592 --> 00:05:31.095
Everyone's injuries
are healing up!

00:05:31.162 --> 00:05:34.603
[TOWNSMAN B] We can figure it
out later! For now, let's run!

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.439
[USOPP]
Not so fast!

00:05:36.507 --> 00:05:38.877
Listen to what I
have to say first!

00:05:40.614 --> 00:05:42.919
[TOWNSMAN B]
Yes, Hack? What is it?

00:05:42.985 --> 00:05:45.591
Not him! Listen to me!

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:49.298
[TOWNSPEOPLE scream]

00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:51.235
The Five-Star guy, God Usopp!

00:05:51.302 --> 00:05:52.706
So what was your crime, anyway?

00:05:52.773 --> 00:05:55.377
[USOPP] Shut up!
We're in a hurry, here!

00:05:55.444 --> 00:05:56.580
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Uh. Yessir!

00:05:56.646 --> 00:05:58.082
Now, this is the deal.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.188
If you're strong, we need your
help in the east and west!

00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:04.863
My friends are there pushing
the Birdcage back by force!

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:06.398
This is the only way!

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:09.071
He really thinks we can
push back the Birdcage?

00:06:09.137 --> 00:06:11.643
No way that's gonna
happen, man! That's crazy!

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.182
[TOWNSMAN H]
Yeah, that's totally impossible.

00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:17.689
Is it? Trust in my friends!

00:06:17.756 --> 00:06:19.926
You won't know until you try!

00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:20.895
[ALL gasp]

00:06:20.962 --> 00:06:22.298
We made a god angry!

00:06:22.364 --> 00:06:24.001
[TOWNSMAN I]
We'll do our best!

00:06:24.068 --> 00:06:26.306
[USOPP pants]

00:06:26.372 --> 00:06:28.109
You need to sit down?

00:06:28.176 --> 00:06:31.315
[USOPP sighs]
Or take a nap.

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:32.619
You think they're
really gonna help,

00:06:32.685 --> 00:06:34.522
or are they just faking it?

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:38.463
Viola, could you check and--
Huh? What happened?

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:39.666
Did she run off?

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.970
[HACK] She was here
just a moment ago.

00:06:42.037 --> 00:06:43.874
We'll just have to
hope for the best.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.747
We'd better ask other islanders
for help while we can.

00:06:46.814 --> 00:06:48.651
If we can hold out
a little more,

00:06:48.718 --> 00:06:51.488
I know we can count on Luffy!

00:06:54.963 --> 00:06:56.633
[LOGAN groans]

00:07:00.675 --> 00:07:02.477
[DOFLAMINGO]
Straw Hat!

00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:05.383
Your human shields didn't
offer much resistance!

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.456
Stop playing games
and show yourself!

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:17.508
Sorry buddy, but this
"human shield"... [pants]

00:07:17.575 --> 00:07:19.980
...ain't finished with you yet.

00:07:20.047 --> 00:07:22.952
[DOFLAMINGO]
Get your filthy hands off me,

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:25.658
you piece of trash.

00:07:25.724 --> 00:07:26.926
[groans]

00:07:28.864 --> 00:07:31.001
[COMPETITOR A]
I'm not giving up!

00:07:31.068 --> 00:07:34.709
[COMPETITOR B] We're keeping you
right here, till Lucy gets back!

00:07:34.776 --> 00:07:37.481
[COMPETITOR C yells]
Run him through!

00:07:37.548 --> 00:07:39.251
I don't care if you stab me!

00:07:39.318 --> 00:07:41.088
[COMPETITORS yell]

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:45.330
If you fools want to
suffer that badly,

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:47.902
then I can oblige.

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:49.839
How many people
do I have to mutilate

00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:53.213
to get your attention,
Straw Hat?

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:54.716
[gasps]

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.431
[TOWNSMAN J] I've got a child!
Let us through!

00:08:02.497 --> 00:08:05.403
What's the holdup?
The Birdcage is right there!

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.240
[TOWNSMAN K] They said
there's danger up ahead!

00:08:07.307 --> 00:08:09.011
Nobody here is
making any progress!

00:08:09.078 --> 00:08:11.749
Everyone in the kingdom
was headed for downtown,

00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:14.021
but now that we're here,
we're stuck!

00:08:14.087 --> 00:08:15.423
[TOWNSMAN J]
No way.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.494
[REBECCA]
Everyone! You need to move!

00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:18.831
Go towards the plateau!

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:20.901
Where the Royal Palace is at!

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:22.838
You're Rebecca!

00:08:22.905 --> 00:08:25.945
It's safe that way?
Are you sure?

00:08:26.012 --> 00:08:30.419
Yes! That's where the center
of the Birdcage is moving.

00:08:30.486 --> 00:08:33.794
Please hurry!
It's not safe here!

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.101
Okay! I guess I'll
take your word for it!

00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:39.037
[TOWNSMAN M gasps]
Yeah.

00:08:39.104 --> 00:08:40.641
--[TOWNSMAN N] Me, too!
--[TOWNSMAN O] Let's go!

00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:42.579
[TOWNSMAN P]
Did you hear that? The plateau!

00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:44.582
Everyone run to the plateau!

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:48.523
Listen! Downtown is
a battlefield, it's not safe!

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.661
Everyone needs to
run to the plateau!

00:08:50.728 --> 00:08:53.166
No time to explain! Just hurry!

00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:54.067
[TOWNSMAN Q]
You hear that?

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:55.203
[TOWNSMAN R]
Go!

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.775
It's going to be all right!
Don't lose hope!

00:08:57.842 --> 00:09:01.616
There are still people out there
fighting to save Dressrosa!

00:09:01.683 --> 00:09:02.852
They're holding
back the Birdcage

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:05.123
with all the strength
they've got!

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:10.166
Rebecca, go! Try to guide
the citizens to safety!

00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:12.739
Just leave the Birdcage to us!

00:09:12.805 --> 00:09:14.876
Come on! You'll be okay!

00:09:14.943 --> 00:09:16.813
[TOWNSMAN S]
Thanks, Rebecca!

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.919
[REBECCA] They're fighting the
Birdcage with all their might.

00:09:31.142 --> 00:09:33.514
[REBECCA] But what if
it can't be stopped,

00:09:33.581 --> 00:09:35.618
no matter how strong they are?

00:09:35.685 --> 00:09:38.289
Then all their efforts
will be in vain.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.329
[REBECCA] I know I can't fight
as well as someone like Lucy.

00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:19.205
But still. If everyone is
laying their lives on the line,

00:10:19.271 --> 00:10:21.643
I have to do whatever I can!

00:10:22.444 --> 00:10:23.880
[REBECCA]
I'm sorry, Father,

00:10:23.947 --> 00:10:26.385
but there's only
one way to end this.

00:10:28.657 --> 00:10:30.994
[REBECCA]
By killing Doflamingo!

00:10:34.234 --> 00:10:36.506
[gasps] Viola!

00:10:36.573 --> 00:10:38.744
Rebecca! What are you
doing here?

00:10:38.811 --> 00:10:41.115
I'm here to fight! I have to!

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:44.254
That's ridiculous
and you know it!

00:10:44.321 --> 00:10:45.824
If I let you join your mother,

00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:49.766
I would never be able to face
Kyros again, as long as I lived!

00:10:49.833 --> 00:10:51.169
Get away from here!

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:55.978
So, what business
do you have with me, Viola?

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:02.525
[chuckles]

00:11:02.592 --> 00:11:05.765
[VIOLET] The Don Quixote Family
is about to be obliterated.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.502
If I do nothing
to take responsibility

00:11:07.568 --> 00:11:09.038
as a former Executive,

00:11:09.105 --> 00:11:11.408
it would be an insult
to this nation.

00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:12.912
You can't!

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.702
[VIOLET]
Only one of us is going to

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:27.407
leave this battle alive, Doffy.

00:11:29.277 --> 00:11:30.514
Now face me!

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.689
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles] You always
were a woman of passion.

00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:37.193
Weren't you, Violet?

00:11:56.331 --> 00:11:58.035
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:12:00.106 --> 00:12:01.475
Viola, no!

00:12:11.495 --> 00:12:15.437
We gotta push way harder!
You got this, little bros!

00:12:15.504 --> 00:12:16.906
[DWARVES]
We're trying!

00:12:16.973 --> 00:12:19.546
We'll stop this thing,
I guarantee!

00:12:19.612 --> 00:12:21.448
Now what're we gonna do?

00:12:21.516 --> 00:12:23.620
[DWARVES]
We're all gonna push!

00:12:23.687 --> 00:12:26.826
[yelling]

00:12:32.438 --> 00:12:34.074
Is this a success?

00:12:34.141 --> 00:12:38.416
I think it's slowing down
a little bit. Probably.

00:12:39.218 --> 00:12:43.125
It is slight, but I
believe you are correct.

00:12:44.094 --> 00:12:46.933
Actually, I stand corrected--
it's speeding up.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.537
'Cause you're running
your mouth too much

00:12:48.603 --> 00:12:50.439
and not pushing enough!

00:12:59.391 --> 00:13:00.861
I don't have time for you!

00:13:00.928 --> 00:13:02.832
Sorry, but I'm afraid
you'll have to

00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:06.371
tell me who's speaking--
I'm blind, you see.

00:13:08.008 --> 00:13:12.016
What now? We can't afford
to abandon our duty!

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.573
[ZORO]
Damn it!

00:13:29.685 --> 00:13:31.221
[ZORO, KIN'EMON]
Huh?

00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:34.027
Hard to turn my back
on people in need,

00:13:34.094 --> 00:13:36.298
even if they are
a bunch of fools.

00:13:36.365 --> 00:13:39.037
Although my strength
may be meager,

00:13:39.104 --> 00:13:42.276
I shall devote it to
your cause all the same.

00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:45.182
[MARINE A]
All right, men. Halt!

00:13:47.622 --> 00:13:50.359
[MARINE A] Assist whoever you
can in pushing back the cage!

00:13:50.426 --> 00:13:51.529
[MARINES]
Yessir!

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.065
The Navy?

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.175
Ah! What fortune!

00:13:58.242 --> 00:14:00.915
Why, we may survive this, yet!

00:14:00.981 --> 00:14:04.287
Those who can't use Haki,
head to the factory.

00:14:04.354 --> 00:14:05.357
[MARINES]
Yessir!

00:14:05.423 --> 00:14:08.597
[yells]

00:14:08.663 --> 00:14:10.601
Huh? The Navy is here?

00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:13.640
Now let's push that factory!

00:14:17.748 --> 00:14:20.420
It's coming! Run away!

00:14:20.486 --> 00:14:23.292
[TOWNSMAN T]
Hey! Don't stop! You crazy?

00:14:23.359 --> 00:14:26.533
If everyone runs away,
how will anything get fixed?

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.236
I'm pushing, too!

00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:29.437
What? Wait!

00:14:29.505 --> 00:14:30.607
Now, push!

00:14:30.674 --> 00:14:32.611
[MARINES grunt]

00:14:32.678 --> 00:14:35.383
Damn it! Me too!

00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:36.853
Check out these arms!

00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:38.924
Yeah! That's the spirit!

00:14:38.991 --> 00:14:39.992
Check mine, too!

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:41.796
We came here to help push!

00:14:41.863 --> 00:14:44.502
This is our kingdom,
so we gotta protect it!

00:14:44.568 --> 00:14:46.072
Mega muscles comin' through!

00:14:46.138 --> 00:14:47.908
That's what I like to hear!

00:14:47.975 --> 00:14:50.547
Now, time to give this
everything you've got!

00:14:50.614 --> 00:14:53.686
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Yeah!

00:14:56.292 --> 00:14:58.095
[TOWNSMAN Y]
There they are!

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:00.967
We might not be
as strong as you are,

00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:02.237
but we want to push, too!

00:15:02.304 --> 00:15:04.709
Heh. Then get up here and push!

00:15:04.776 --> 00:15:06.278
[TOWNSMAN Y]
All right!

00:15:07.981 --> 00:15:09.451
[TOWNSMAN Z]
Count me in!

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:11.154
[TOWNSMAN AA] I'm not getting
chopped up without a fight!

00:15:11.221 --> 00:15:13.359
You have my thanks! Truly!

00:15:13.426 --> 00:15:16.032
Of course! It's the
least we could do!

00:15:16.098 --> 00:15:17.835
All right! You ready?

00:15:17.902 --> 00:15:19.404
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:15:19.471 --> 00:15:21.509
Whatcha gonna do?

00:15:21.576 --> 00:15:22.945
[ALL]
Push!

00:15:23.011 --> 00:15:26.084
Keep it up!

00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:46.191
Keep it up!

00:15:55.443 --> 00:15:57.815
It's not slowing down!
We're done for!

00:15:57.882 --> 00:15:59.719
It's far too early to give up!

00:15:59.786 --> 00:16:02.959
This is Mister Zoro's plan,
so it's gotta work!

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:07.534
I'm gonna stop this
damn thing if it kills me!

00:16:10.674 --> 00:16:13.680
Let's go!

00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:18.489
[yells]

00:16:18.557 --> 00:16:25.570
[ALL yelling]

00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:55.664
[ALL gasp]

00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:21.883
[panting]

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.653
[chuckles]

00:17:25.925 --> 00:17:28.262
[ZORO]
How 'bout that!

00:17:28.328 --> 00:17:29.932
Did the Birdcage stop?

00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:31.268
Huh?

00:17:31.334 --> 00:17:37.079
All right! Go, Zoro!
Now we don't have to die!

00:17:42.625 --> 00:17:43.660
Time for round two!

00:17:43.727 --> 00:17:46.733
Even if it started up again,
we did stop it!

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.271
Mister Zoro showed us the way!

00:17:49.338 --> 00:17:52.177
Thank you for guiding
us with your light!

00:17:52.243 --> 00:17:55.482
It wasn't for long,
but they stopped it!

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.189
[VIOLET] We just need to
buy a little more time!

00:17:58.255 --> 00:18:00.326
We can do it, Straw Hat!

00:18:00.392 --> 00:18:02.999
Insolent little punks.

00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:04.234
[MARINE F]
Keep pushing!

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.939
We stopped it once
and we'll do it again!

00:18:07.006 --> 00:18:08.342
[MARINE G]
Everyone together now!

00:18:08.409 --> 00:18:11.850
[MARINE H]
Time for a big push! Ready?

00:18:12.718 --> 00:18:16.058
[GUARD A gasps] King Riku?
And Commander Tank?

00:18:16.124 --> 00:18:18.129
We'll save this kingdom yet!

00:18:18.195 --> 00:18:20.133
You've done well so far!

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.070
If not for your efforts,
we would've lost

00:18:22.137 --> 00:18:24.441
thousands of our
citizens already!

00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:27.480
Heh. You can't keep people
in no birdcage, brother!

00:18:27.547 --> 00:18:30.419
Don't you know that these folks
were born to be free?

00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:32.390
And how are we gonna prove it?

00:18:32.457 --> 00:18:34.460
[DWARVES]
We're gonna push!

00:18:34.528 --> 00:18:35.897
Then what?

00:18:35.964 --> 00:18:37.668
[MARINES]
We push some more!

00:18:37.735 --> 00:18:39.037
You're nothing, Birdcage!

00:18:39.104 --> 00:18:41.609
You can't stop us!

00:18:41.676 --> 00:18:47.253
[ALL yelling]

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.224
Do you think a couple
of miserable seconds

00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:51.028
are going to turn this around?

00:18:51.095 --> 00:18:55.235
You were doomed from the start
and you're still doomed now.

00:18:56.304 --> 00:18:58.576
Keep telling yourself that.

00:19:09.263 --> 00:19:13.539
Hierro Lagrima! Tearwhales!

00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:31.241
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:43.866
Viola, run! That's enough!

00:19:49.243 --> 00:19:50.412
[gasps]

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.853
Please, get up!

00:19:56.424 --> 00:19:58.495
[DOFLAMINGO]
I know what you're thinking.

00:19:58.563 --> 00:20:01.636
You spent ten years with me
as part of the Family.

00:20:01.703 --> 00:20:04.875
So surely I would hesitate
for a moment at least

00:20:04.942 --> 00:20:07.080
before I killed you.

00:20:07.147 --> 00:20:10.520
But you misunderstand
my philosophy.

00:20:11.255 --> 00:20:12.524
[VIOLET gasps]

00:20:16.498 --> 00:20:19.738
[DOFLAMINGO] I don't punish my
associates for their failures.

00:20:19.805 --> 00:20:21.609
I forgive them.

00:20:21.676 --> 00:20:25.984
But betrayals are
another matter, entirely.

00:20:32.396 --> 00:20:34.868
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.582
Don't worry. You can play, too.

00:20:46.893 --> 00:20:52.671
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles] Look at
your sweet Rebecca now, Violet.

00:20:52.738 --> 00:20:54.307
[VIOLET gasps]

00:20:57.046 --> 00:20:58.481
[VIOLET]
No!

00:20:59.283 --> 00:21:03.626
[REBECCA]
My body... I can't control it!

00:21:03.693 --> 00:21:06.298
What's she doing
with that sword?

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:08.235
That doesn't look safe at all!

00:21:08.301 --> 00:21:10.305
You bastard.

00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:12.611
[REBECCA]
No...

00:21:17.754 --> 00:21:20.392
[chuckles]

00:21:25.737 --> 00:21:30.981
[chuckles] Good girl.
Come this way for me.

00:21:31.048 --> 00:21:32.283
Leave her alone!

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.353
This battle's between
you and me!

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.759
I can't...

00:21:36.826 --> 00:21:39.264
I can't stop it!

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.335
Viola!

00:21:41.402 --> 00:21:43.740
Keep fighting it!

00:21:43.807 --> 00:21:47.480
[REBECCA]
I'm trying, but it's no use!

00:21:47.547 --> 00:21:51.020
Very good. Now kill Violet.

00:21:57.233 --> 00:22:00.840
I'm so sorry!
I don't want this!

00:22:00.907 --> 00:22:02.844
But he's too strong!

00:22:05.917 --> 00:22:07.520
Rebecca!

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.729
[chuckles]

00:22:11.795 --> 00:22:13.666
C'mon, stop!

00:22:15.737 --> 00:22:17.807
[REBECCA]
Please forgive me!

00:22:23.987 --> 00:22:25.489
[TOWNSMAN AH gasps]
It's made it all the way

00:22:25.557 --> 00:22:27.527
to the old King's Plateau!

00:22:27.594 --> 00:22:30.533
Damn it! There's
not much city left!

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.639
People are gonna start dying
one after another soon!

00:22:33.706 --> 00:22:35.744
Keep pushing! This is it!

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:38.649
[TOWNSMAN AJ] Even a second
could save lives!

00:22:41.556 --> 00:22:42.891
[GYATS]
Hey, I lost count--

00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:45.362
How much longer
until Lucy comes back?

00:22:45.429 --> 00:22:48.034
[ATTENDANT B]
I... I'm not sure.

00:22:48.101 --> 00:22:50.206
[NARRATOR] The Birdcage
was halted for a moment,

00:22:50.273 --> 00:22:52.911
but now it continues to close.

00:22:54.882 --> 00:22:58.421
[NARRATOR] The time remaining
is 60 seconds.

00:22:58.488 --> 00:23:02.731
The time until Luffy recovers
is also 60 seconds.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.325
[NARRATOR] The Birdcage
has advanced all the way

00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:17.628
to the King's Plateau.

00:23:17.695 --> 00:23:19.631
As Dressrosa crumbles to pieces,

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:21.535
its people pray
for Luffy's return,

00:23:21.602 --> 00:23:24.307
while his allies try to hold out
for just a moment longer.

00:23:24.374 --> 00:23:27.814
At the center of this struggle,
Viola fails to stop Doflamingo

00:23:27.881 --> 00:23:30.319
and finds herself at
the end of Rebecca's blade.

00:23:30.386 --> 00:23:32.223
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.795
"Dead or Alive!
A Fateful Countdown!"

00:23:34.862 --> 00:23:37.934
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
