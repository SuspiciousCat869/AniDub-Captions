1
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:43,658
[GOLD ROGER] The world.
What a glorious place!

2
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:49,039
Seek freedom and it will lie
stretched out before your eyes.

3
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:53,543
If the endless dream guides
your restless spirit, seize it!

4
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:57,213
Raise your flag, and stand tall!

5
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,052
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)</i>

6
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:05,221
<i>I think back to the time</i>
<i>when my search first began--</i>

7
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:07,599
<i>I left behind those</i>
<i>shores of sand--</i>

8
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:12,145
<i>For the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

9
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:15,106
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

10
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,400
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

11
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:25,700
<i>See the light I have searched</i>
<i>for everywhere (ere-ere!)</i>

12
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:28,203
<i>When the summer sun is shining,</i>

13
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:30,830
<i>shaking the sails</i>
<i>of my heart, I know...</i>

14
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:35,835
<i>(Fly away glum blue sea)</i>

15
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:38,254
<i>A brand-new world</i>
<i>that had been hiding</i>

16
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:40,882
<i>has opened up its</i>
<i>doors for me to go...</i>

17
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:45,261
<i>(Fly away glum blue sky)</i>

18
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:47,806
<i>Swaying in the troubled waves--</i>

19
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,266
<i>From all despair,</i>
<i>I can be saved--</i>

20
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,561
<i>For the horizon</i>
<i>on the other side is--</i>

21
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,814
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</i>

22
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:57,899
<i>Is what I aim for!</i>

23
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:00,944
<i>And though I've traveled far</i>
<i>from where my search began--</i>

24
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:03,446
<i>Over seas of green</i>
<i>and shores of sand--</i>

25
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,159
<i>Through the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

26
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:10,954
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

27
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:13,248
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

28
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:18,336
<i>See the light I have</i>
<i>searched for everywhere!</i>

29
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:25,218
Give back Pops' gold!
Every bit of it! Right now!

30
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,636
What gold?

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,887
[laughs]

32
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:30,890
You mean the junk we got
from old man Cricket?

33
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:46,406
So long, Straw Hat!

34
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:48,199
[yells]

35
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:09,429
[SARQUISS]
No! I'll show you a real punch!

36
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:11,348
Where are you going?

37
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:12,891
[ALL gasp]

38
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:14,559
[LUFFY]
Where am I going?

39
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:19,397
Up there.

40
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:27,405
[LUFFY] "Take to the Sky!
Ride the Knockup Stream!"

41
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:37,624
Where the heck is that
rubbery, bug-eyed idiot?

42
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:39,292
This is just like him!

43
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:41,878
Didn't we all agree to be
here over 45 minutes ago?

44
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:44,339
We're gonna miss the current!

45
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:46,883
Ugh. I'm sure the genius
didn't even stop to consider

46
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,593
how the gold would
weigh him down.

47
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:49,886
Why does he always insist

48
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:51,971
on making everything
ten times harder?

49
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:54,224
[USOPP] The only schedule
Luffy's concerned with

50
00:03:54,307 --> 00:03:55,266
is his own.

51
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,143
Yeah. He's got a point there.

52
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:59,771
You don't think someone in
town beat him up, do you?

53
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:01,481
What, you mean that guy Bellamy?

54
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:03,024
Well, if Bellamy
didn't beat him up,

55
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:05,026
you better believe I will!

56
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,404
Oh, is that right, tough girl?

57
00:04:10,532 --> 00:04:13,493
[LUFFY]
Hey!

58
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:14,577
Huh?

59
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:20,875
Look there! He's back.
I knew he'd make it.

60
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,627
I did it, you guys!

61
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:25,755
[SANJI] Luffy, hurry!
We're already behind schedule!

62
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,716
[laughing]

63
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,467
[LUFFY]
Look, it's a Hercules!

64
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:31,428
It took me forever to find it!

65
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:32,887
You're kidding me!

66
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:35,181
Are you crazy?!

67
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:36,599
[gasps]

68
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:45,108
[LUFFY]
Whoa! That's awesome!

69
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:48,111
Introducing the Going
Merry flying edition.

70
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:49,946
It can fly?!

71
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,949
I know! They built
it just for us!

72
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,409
[MASIRA CREW]
Yahoo!

73
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:55,326
[LUFFY laughs]

74
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,995
[MASIRA CREW laughs]

75
00:04:57,996 --> 00:04:59,164
Morons.

76
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:01,249
Something about it makes
me feel kinda uneasy.

77
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,335
Well, for once I agree with you.

78
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:05,253
Chickens don't even
know how to fly.

79
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:07,088
They should've made it a pigeon.

80
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:10,050
What's that got to do
with anything, ya dope?!

81
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,468
It's time to set sail!

82
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,428
C'mon, if you're with me,
let me hear it!

83
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,764
[MASIRA CREW]
Yeah!

84
00:05:31,613 --> 00:05:34,115
What are you waitin' for?
Get on board.

85
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,701
Unless you plan on missin'
your chance at the sky.

86
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,411
Like a fool.

87
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:40,789
Heh. Thanks for the ship.

88
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:46,836
Thank them. They built it.

89
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,220
Yeah. Thanks for
the ship, you guys!

90
00:05:55,303 --> 00:05:57,681
You can have my Hercules!

91
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:01,768
[SHOJO] Ooh! Really?
You mean it? Are you sure?

92
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:04,062
[ALL]
That's so kind of you!

93
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:06,231
All right, enough of
this foolishness!

94
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:07,357
We don't have much time!

95
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,694
[SHOJO]
Follow us! We'll lead the way!

96
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:12,153
[USOPP]
Come on, Luffy! Let's go!

97
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:13,738
[LUFFY]
Coming!

98
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:20,912
[BELLAMY] This "City of Gold"
is just a fairytale!

99
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:23,623
That liar, Noland,
dreamt it all up!

100
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:28,670
Your dreams will never
come true! Ever!

101
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:32,507
[BELLAMY, SARQUISS laughing]

102
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,678
[laughing]

103
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:40,807
Saruyama!

104
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,642
[MASIRA CREW]
Aye!

105
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:45,770
[CRICKET]
I'm counting on you, men.

106
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:47,731
I don't care what happens,

107
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:50,608
you give our friends here
everything you've got!

108
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:52,360
[MASIRA CREW]
Yeah!

109
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:57,490
[LUFFY]
Time to set sail!

110
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,328
You heard him. Shove off!

111
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:03,288
All right!

112
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,749
Yes, Nami!

113
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,056
[CRICKET] Well, kid, looks like
this is where we part ways.

114
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:23,600
Yep.

115
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:25,602
[CRICKET] There's only one thing
you gotta remember,

116
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:27,354
above everything else.

117
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:28,605
[LUFFY]
What?

118
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:32,734
Not one person in history
has ever disproved

119
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:35,195
the existence of sky island.

120
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:39,407
People may say I'm crazy
and even laugh at me,

121
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,409
but I don't care.

122
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:44,412
I'm a romantic. Like you.

123
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,040
Romantic.

124
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:51,044
So long!

125
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:59,177
Oh, yeah. Thanks for the gold.

126
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,681
And hey, don't be fallin'
from the sky, ya hear?

127
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:04,808
[chuckles]

128
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:06,810
[LUFFY]
See ya around, Pops!

129
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:09,604
[NAMI]
Thanks for everything, Cricket!

130
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:10,689
[USOPP]
Think of us when you find

131
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:13,149
the City of Gold, old-timer!

132
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:17,112
[LUFFY]
Try and take it easy, okay?!

133
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:19,364
[CRICKET]
Mind your own business!

134
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:29,624
[BLACKBEARD]
It's morning already?

135
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,919
Burgess. See anything out there?

136
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:35,964
[BURGESS] Can't even see an
outline of the shore yet.

137
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:39,092
You really think they're
going to that sky island?

138
00:08:39,175 --> 00:08:40,885
Yeah, so they say.

139
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:43,013
They'll be pretty tough
to follow up there,

140
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:45,890
so we gotta take care
of 'em before that.

141
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:47,600
Straw Hat Luffy.

142
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:48,685
Who'd have thought that twerp

143
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:52,147
would be worth a
hundred million Berries?

144
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,942
[MASIRA] Okay, listen up!
It's currently 7:00 am.

145
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:59,738
We need to arrive at our final
destination no later than 11:00.

146
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:01,656
It's like Cricket
already told us.

147
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,075
The spot where the
Knockup Stream erupts

148
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,536
is different every single time.

149
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:08,913
We need to get there
as early as possible

150
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:12,042
in order to pin point
it's exact location.

151
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,210
[LUFFY]
Check it out.

152
00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:15,462
[MASIRA] It looks like
we're already running

153
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:17,380
a little behind schedule.

154
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:20,592
Hey! Are you knuckleheads
payin' attention?!

155
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:23,762
[LUFFY] Did you see that?
It has to face forward!

156
00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:26,723
Strange. I've never seen
a bird quite like him.

157
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:27,849
[LUFFY laughing]

158
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:29,768
He only faces south,
isn't that funny?

159
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:31,936
The goofy bird acts
just like a compass!

160
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,191
[LUFFY laughing]

161
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:37,734
Did you hear what it said?

162
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:40,195
He said he's going to face a
different direction on purpose

163
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:41,821
and laugh at us once we're lost.

164
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:42,947
[LUFFY laughs]

165
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:44,449
[LUFFY]
Go ahead and try!

166
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:47,702
[grunting]

167
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:50,163
Whoa. He's really facing north.

168
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:56,711
[grunting]

169
00:09:57,837 --> 00:09:59,464
[LUFFY]
Told ya he couldn't do it!

170
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:01,466
[LUFFY, CHOPPER laughing]

171
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:02,884
[SHOJO CREWMAN A]
Hey!

172
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:06,304
Show the boss some respect
and pipe down over there!

173
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:07,847
No. They're fine.

174
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:09,974
Why, it reminds me
of the old days

175
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:12,060
when I was young and irreverent.

176
00:10:12,143 --> 00:10:14,562
Uh-oh. What'd they'd say?

177
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:18,066
Hey! There's no point
gettin' so worked up, fella.

178
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,527
Ha-ha! Try to relax!

179
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,279
And who put us
behind schedule again?

180
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:24,823
You know what, he's right.

181
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:26,408
Being tense won't
get us anywhere.

182
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,660
We may as well enjoy ourselves.

183
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:31,287
I see your point.
Full speed ahead, men.

184
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:34,499
Anyone not relaxing
answers to me.

185
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:36,042
[SHOJO CREW sighs]

186
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:38,670
[LUFFY]
Ahh. That's better.

187
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:40,463
[MASIRA CREW sighs]

188
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:43,758
[ZORO]
This is ridiculous.

189
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:49,723
Wait. What's over there?

190
00:10:49,806 --> 00:10:52,350
The sky! It's dark!

191
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,145
[MASIRA CREWMAN A]
Boss! Look!

192
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:56,479
What's wrong?

193
00:10:56,563 --> 00:10:59,858
I see the cumuloregalis cloud!
To the southwest!

194
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:01,609
[MASIRA]
It can't be! What time is it?

195
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:02,861
[MASIRA CREWMAN A]
Ten o'clock!

196
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:05,071
They're a full hour early!

197
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:07,866
[MASIRA] Shojo! Do you
think we can make it?

198
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:09,868
[SHOJO]
Dispatch the Utan Divers!

199
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,037
Find me those currents!

200
00:11:14,956 --> 00:11:17,250
[NAMI]
They're incredible!

201
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:20,003
What's going on now?

202
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:21,629
The cumuloregalis
clouds appeared

203
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:22,964
a lot sooner than expected,

204
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,133
so now everyone's scrambling
to find a current!

205
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:29,512
[screams]

206
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:34,684
Sonar waves detected!

207
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:36,603
There's a large current
at 12 o'clock!

208
00:11:36,686 --> 00:11:38,730
[SHOJO CREWMAN B] Large creature
detected at nine o'clock!

209
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:40,648
It could be a Sea King!

210
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:43,943
There's wave activity
detected at ten o'clock

211
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:45,278
going against the current!

212
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:47,614
I believe it's a giant
whirlpool, sir!

213
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:50,784
That's it! Full speed ahead
directly for ten o'clock!

214
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,702
That's where the Knockup
Stream's gonna erupt,

215
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:53,661
I'm sure of it!

216
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:55,121
Now go!

217
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:00,627
Hold on!

218
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,420
[NAMI]
The waves are getting higher!

219
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:04,589
[USOPP]
We're gonna sink!

220
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,302
[MASIRA] Steady, men.
It's a pre-eruption tremor!

221
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:10,679
[CHOPPER]
Eruption?!

222
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:14,391
Hey, Navigator! What
does the Log Pose say?

223
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:19,562
It's pointing straight
at those clouds!

224
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:22,399
[USOPP] You mean the sky
island's above that?

225
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,025
The wind direction's perfect.

226
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:25,694
The clouds are lining
up exactly over

227
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:27,696
the center of the whirlpool.

228
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,074
[LUFFY] What whirlpool?
I haven't seen anything.

229
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:32,409
Nice work, brother!

230
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:34,619
I think we hit the
jackpot this time.

231
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:37,956
Yes! And it seems we're in
for a nice-sized explosion!

232
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,582
[LUFFY]
Do you think we'll make it?

233
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,209
[MASIRA]
Of course!

234
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:43,753
What's that?

235
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:46,089
We'll lead you
to the inner edge.

236
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:48,341
All right. But what
should we do?

237
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:51,428
Position yourself on the flow
and head towards the center.

238
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:54,014
Then you'll be fine.

239
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:56,391
[NAMI]
He wants us to go to the center?

240
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:21,583
[CRICKET] I've never met a group
of characters like them before.

241
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,460
You mean there's no sky island?

242
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:24,669
Are you for sure?

243
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:27,505
Cricket's gold! It's all gone!

244
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:29,632
I'll be back by morning, guys.

245
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:31,843
[chuckles]

246
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:34,054
[LUFFY]
See ya around, Pops!

247
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:39,976
[CRICKET]
Always yappin' about dreams.

248
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,979
[USOPP]
But I don't wanna get sucked in!

249
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,652
I don't remember
signing up for all this!

250
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:50,737
[SANJI]
Don't worry!

251
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,781
I'll make sure nothing
happens to you!

252
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:55,492
[ROBIN] I've never seen one
quite this big before.

253
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,161
[chuckles]

254
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:00,997
This is bad! I change my
mind! I wanna go back!

255
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:03,083
[ZORO]
Sorry, Usopp, too late for that.

256
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,251
"You know who"
is already excited.

257
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:07,379
Let's go! To the sky!

258
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:09,631
[laughs]

259
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:14,969
[CHOPPER, USOPP wheezing]

260
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,995
[MASIRA]
It's time for us to go!

261
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:44,708
The rest is up to
you now! Good luck!

262
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,918
Bye, guys! And thanks
a lot for everything!

263
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:48,044
Don't go!

264
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:50,296
Don't go! I don't want to die!

265
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,092
Please, take me with you!
Gimme a break, I'm scared!

266
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:55,927
Please don't make me!

267
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:58,179
[NAMI] No one said anything
about diving head first

268
00:14:58,263 --> 00:14:59,723
into a giant whirlpool!

269
00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:01,016
[USOPP]
Why's it getting dark?!

270
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:04,269
[CHOPPER]
Oh, no! We're being sucked in!

271
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:05,770
Don't be so unreasonable, Luffy!

272
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:07,564
Let's go back while
we still have time!

273
00:15:07,647 --> 00:15:09,357
Don't you understand
this sky island stuff

274
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,775
is just a bunch of make-believe?

275
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:13,278
It's not worth
getting us killed!

276
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:15,989
It's all make believe?
Is that what you think?

277
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:19,451
Usopp's right! I think
this is a really bad idea!

278
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:23,496
[LUFFY] It may be a stupid
dream, but I have to try.

279
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,124
It could be our
greatest adventure!

280
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,085
[USOPP, NAMI]
No. It's too late.

281
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:34,382
Instead of wasting
your time bickering,

282
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,509
you all might wanna take a look.

283
00:15:36,593 --> 00:15:37,969
What do you mean?

284
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:42,557
[ZORO]
It's sucking us in.

285
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,018
[STRAW HATS yelling]

286
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:47,812
[SANJI] Hurry, Nami!
Let my arms protect you!

287
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:50,815
[STRAW HATS screaming]

288
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,818
[screaming]

289
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,698
[SANJI]
What happened? It disappeared.

290
00:15:58,782 --> 00:16:00,658
[LUFFY]
What's goin' on?

291
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,244
[USOPP]
Wait. I-I don't get it.

292
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:04,662
Where'd it go?

293
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,337
I feel it.

294
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,089
It's starting.

295
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:18,593
[NAMI] The whirlpool sunk
under the surface.

296
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:23,139
[USOPP]
You don't mean...

297
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:25,767
[BLACKBEARD]
Hold it right there!

298
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:30,063
Hey, uh, Zoro?

299
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:31,231
Look.

300
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:36,319
[BLACKBEARD laughing]

301
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:40,615
[BLACKBEARD]
Well, well, well.

302
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,868
If it isn't Straw Hat Luffy.

303
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:46,705
It's him. It's that
Mock Town guy!

304
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:49,249
What guy?

305
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:50,667
I've come all this
way to collect

306
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,669
on your hundred-
million-Berry bounty!

307
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:54,587
So don't be shy!

308
00:16:54,671 --> 00:16:59,134
[BLACKBEARD laughing]

309
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:02,012
[SHOJO] Were those youngsters
expecting some company?

310
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:04,973
[MASIRA]
I don't know, brother.

311
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:10,687
Hm? Why's it getting
dark out here?

312
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,857
Hundred million?
What're you talkin' about?

313
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,526
Don't play dumb with me, kid.

314
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,861
It says right here.

315
00:17:17,944 --> 00:17:21,406
Monkey D. Luffy wanted
for a hundred million.

316
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:25,910
And for Pirate Hunter Zoro:
60 million Berries!

317
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:28,913
It's true. He's got a different
poster for each of you.

318
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:32,208
Hey, Zoro. Congratulations
on your new bounty! Ha!

319
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:33,835
[SANJI]
Wait a minute, Usopp!

320
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:36,171
Come on. Do you see one for me?

321
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:37,756
[USOPP]
Uh, no.

322
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,591
Look closer.

323
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:40,884
Nothin'.

324
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:44,846
It looks like your bounties
must've gone way up

325
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:46,556
after the Alabasta incident.

326
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:48,767
But a hundred million?

327
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,934
[LUFFY]
This is great!

328
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:53,271
Hear that? My bounty
went up big time!

329
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,314
[ZORO chuckles]

330
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:56,483
Sixty million's not
too bad either.

331
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,568
It's not a good thing!

332
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:03,156
[SHOJO] Make sure to keep your
eyes open, Going Merry crew!

333
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:11,122
It's here. I hope
they're ready for it.

334
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:13,333
[SHOJO]
Brace yourselves!

335
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:17,587
[BLACKBEARD]
Huh?

336
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:19,923
[SANJI]
Everyone hold on or get inside!

337
00:18:20,006 --> 00:18:21,591
[USOPP screaming]

338
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:25,387
[USOPP] Oh, no! The ship!
It's being lifted up!

339
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,973
[USOPP crying]

340
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:41,111
[ALL screaming]

341
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,511
[MASIRA CREWMAN B]
Help! We're gonna capsize!

342
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:11,808
Hold steady!

343
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:13,977
Don't let go, men!

344
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:19,941
[MASIRA, SHOJO]
Go sky island!

345
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,277
[STRAW HATS yelling]

346
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,987
[USOPP]
What's happening?!

347
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,364
[SANJI] We're sailing up
a huge pillar of water!

348
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:28,074
[LUFFY]
This is awesome!

349
00:19:28,158 --> 00:19:30,493
[USOPP]
How are we doing this?!

350
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:33,496
Wind.

351
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,417
[LUFFY] All right! I can't
believe it's finally happening.

352
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,545
Let's go to Skypeia!

353
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:45,592
Hold on. It's not gonna
be that easy. Look!

354
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:46,801
Oh, what now?!

355
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,596
What's wrong? Did we
forget about something?

356
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,264
[SANJI]
The hull's starting to float!

357
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:52,807
[NAMI]
Huh?

358
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,018
[SANJI] If we don't stop it,
we're gonna fall into the ocean!

359
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:56,603
[USOPP] What do ya expect
us to do about it?

360
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:59,022
We're having a hard enough
time holding on as it is,

361
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:01,274
or haven't you noticed?

362
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:04,027
Oh, no! What is that?!

363
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,195
[ZORO]
The Sea King!

364
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:07,405
[CHOPPER]
Is that the one from before?!

365
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:13,244
See, it's only a matter of time

366
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,497
before the same thing
happens to the Merry!

367
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,874
I know! But what can we do?

368
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:19,209
We don't have a
whole lot of options

369
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:20,919
when it comes to mother nature.

370
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:22,253
We're at her mercy.

371
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:25,298
[SANJI] I guess we hold on
and hope for the best!

372
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:27,801
[screams]

373
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:30,178
Ships are falling from the sky!

374
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,347
We're gonna end up
driftwood, just like them!

375
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,724
[USOPP] We're gonna take a nose
dive to the bottom of the ocean

376
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:38,478
all because Luffy had to
follow some stupid dream!

377
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:42,774
[NAMI]
Spread the sails! Right now!

378
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:45,860
Sure it's a pillar of water,
but it's still part of the sea.

379
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,821
It's a rising current!

380
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:50,031
The wind from below is
a rising air current

381
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,326
produced by geothermal heat,
causing a steam explosion!

382
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,746
It may be packaged differently,
but it's still wind and water!

383
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,582
Trust me. I'm a
navigator, aren't I?

384
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,253
[SANJI]
Thank you, Nami!

385
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:06,131
All right, gang!
Nami's leading the way!

386
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:07,674
[STRAW HATS]
Yeah!

387
00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:09,592
[NAMI] All right, guys,
catch the starboard wind

388
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:11,136
and align the ship
with the current!

389
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,804
[STRAW HATS]
Yes, ma'am!

390
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:17,142
Hey, we're rising up off
the water! Is that okay?

391
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:20,770
[LUFFY] Nami, do something!
We're gonna fall!

392
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:22,856
Come on. Do it!

393
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,153
[LUFFY]
We're flying!

394
00:21:30,363 --> 00:21:33,241
Yeah! We're headed to the sky!

395
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:35,368
We made it.

396
00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:36,953
[screams]

397
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:38,163
I did it!

398
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:39,539
Yes!

399
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:42,167
Nami! Good job!

400
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,836
I think I love you!

401
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,006
[CRICKET]
Go for it, kid!

402
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,675
Always remember
to keep dreaming!

403
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:58,224
[MASIRA, SHOJO]
Yeah!

404
00:21:58,308 --> 00:21:59,642
[NAMI]
If the wind keeps this up,

405
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:02,687
we can sail as high as we want!

406
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:06,191
Hey, Nami! Are we
almost to Skypeia?

407
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:10,070
If it exists, it's
past those clouds!

408
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:12,280
[LUFFY]
Past the clouds!

409
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,450
I can't wait to find out
what's up in the sky!

410
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:18,119
Let's bust through
'em and find out!

411
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,247
[LUFFY yells]

412
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:30,674
<i>Now, I look up and see,</i>
<i>there's something out there,</i>

413
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:34,302
<i>beyond the endless</i>
<i>clear-blue sky...</i>

414
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:38,014
<i>Possibilities,</i>
<i>of just what could be,</i>

415
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:45,146
<i>a "someday" I'll see if I try...</i>

416
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:01,663
<i>When I am alone</i>

417
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:07,502
<i>all of the memories go</i>
<i>racing through my mind...</i>

418
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:10,005
<i>The things that</i>
<i>I've said and done,</i>

419
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:14,801
<i>the ones I've lost,</i>
<i>the dreams I left behind...</i>

420
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:19,806
<i>Sometimes I felt like</i>
<i>I would defeat myself</i>

421
00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:22,267
<i>until I recalled...</i>

422
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,980
<i>That there was a warm place</i>
<i>I could always go</i>

423
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:30,734
<i>if I happened to fall...</i>

424
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:34,904
<i>With friends and family...</i>

425
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,206
[LUFFY]
Hey, guys, take a look around!

426
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,833
[SANJI]
What is this place?

427
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,126
[LUFFY]
It's solid white!

428
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:50,003
[NAMI]
It's like an ocean in the sky!

429
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:51,546
[USOPP]
What is that?!

430
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:53,173
[SANJI]
What a strange creature...

431
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:54,674
Is it a fish?

432
00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:56,009
[USOPP]
What is that?!

433
00:23:56,092 --> 00:23:57,177
[ZORO]
What now?

434
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,720
[SANJI]
Look! Someone's coming!

435
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:00,472
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

436
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:02,015
"Sail the White Sea!

437
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:04,601
The Sky Knight and
the Gate in the Clouds!"

438
00:24:04,684 --> 00:24:07,062
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
