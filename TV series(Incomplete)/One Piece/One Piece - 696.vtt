00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:37.582
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.487
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:45.732
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.303
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.543
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.446
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.952
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.791
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:02.966
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.502
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:08.510
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:12.885
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:16.492
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.430
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.463 --> 00:03:20.501
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.739
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:22.772 --> 00:03:25.110
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:28.416
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.521
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:30.554 --> 00:03:31.857
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:34.261
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:36.299
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:38.538
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:39.873
[FUJITORA]
Gravity Blade!

00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:42.545
Raging Tiger!

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.720
[SABO]
You were holding back!

00:03:49.626 --> 00:03:52.698
[SABO] The problem is
I still don't know why.

00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:05.658
[FUJITORA] You might say this is
an all-or-nothing gamble for me.

00:04:05.692 --> 00:04:07.829
And the stakes are
as big as they get.

00:04:07.863 --> 00:04:10.968
I'm laying my life on
the line for this one.

00:04:16.546 --> 00:04:17.649
[REBECCA]
Father must be out there

00:04:17.682 --> 00:04:21.422
fighting right now. Somewhere.

00:04:23.894 --> 00:04:26.132
[DIAMANTE groans]

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:27.569
[REBECCA gasps]

00:04:27.602 --> 00:04:29.906
Didn't think you'd make it.

00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:40.460
Rebecca!

00:04:42.598 --> 00:04:46.038
It's a straight shot to the top!
You ready, Traffy?

00:04:46.072 --> 00:04:47.374
[LAW]
Just go!

00:04:47.407 --> 00:04:49.679
[LUFFY gasps]

00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:53.854
I'm going ahead! [grunts]

00:04:53.887 --> 00:04:55.724
Hey, wait a sec!

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.430
Luffy, watch out!

00:04:58.463 --> 00:05:01.736
[BARTOLOMEO]
Leave this to me!

00:05:05.277 --> 00:05:06.580
Damn it, Bartolomeo!

00:05:06.613 --> 00:05:08.985
[coughs]

00:05:09.018 --> 00:05:12.090
[BARTOLOMEO] If it helps
Mister Luffy, even a little...

00:05:13.727 --> 00:05:16.867
Then I'm happy to die,
right here and now!

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.981
[ROBIN] I know how you feel.
I'm with you, Rooster.

00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:32.698
[ROBIN] Our captain
is something special.

00:05:37.073 --> 00:05:41.616
[ROBIN] I'd risk anything
for him. Even my life.

00:05:47.461 --> 00:05:51.570
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

00:05:58.383 --> 00:05:59.620
Let's hurry!

00:05:59.653 --> 00:06:01.690
I gotta get there fast
or Soldier's gonna

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:03.727
kick Mingo's ass before me!

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.963
Yo, Straw Hat!

00:06:04.996 --> 00:06:06.766
Something wrong?

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.041
It still wants to brawl!

00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:13.112
Stop wasting your energy!

00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:17.188
[LAW] We're almost there!
Just shake it off!

00:06:17.221 --> 00:06:18.122
Yeah!

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:27.942
[clanking]

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.613

[DIAMANTE grunts]

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:10.995
[gasps]

00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:17.107
What're you doing here,
little lady?

00:07:21.248 --> 00:07:22.885
[DIAMANTE] Don't tell me
you really think

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:26.092
you have what it
takes to kill Doffy!

00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:28.965
Even you're not that foolish.

00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:30.233
What were you thinking,

00:07:30.267 --> 00:07:31.837
recklessly entering
the tournament

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.342
and challenging me
with that blunt sword?

00:07:34.375 --> 00:07:36.714
Hasn't your family
been disgraced enough?

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:39.284
Guess I'll have to
spell it out for you.

00:07:39.318 --> 00:07:42.057
You stand no chance
against Doffy!

00:07:43.694 --> 00:07:46.298
[DIAMANTE]
Could it be...

00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:47.668
[REBECCA gasps]

00:07:47.702 --> 00:07:51.009
[DIAMANTE] You're here
seeking revenge against me?

00:07:51.042 --> 00:07:52.210
[gasps]

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:07.908
Maybe you remember the day
I shot your mother, girl?

00:08:13.386 --> 00:08:15.189
[DIAMANTE]
Hmm?

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:25.243
That's a good look on you.

00:08:33.093 --> 00:08:36.131
I... I couldn't save her.

00:08:42.211 --> 00:08:44.749
[DIAMANTE laughs]
Well, now!

00:08:44.783 --> 00:08:46.485
Is that a challenge?

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:49.526
C'mon, let's go!

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:54.769
[DIAMANTE laughs]

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.750
[LUFFY]
Listen to me, Rebecca.

00:09:01.783 --> 00:09:03.219
I can promise you one thing.

00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:06.192
I'm gonna give Doflamingo
the beating of his life!

00:09:06.225 --> 00:09:07.795
[gasps]

00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:19.952

00:09:36.586 --> 00:09:37.955
Huh?!

00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:45.638
[DIAMANTE]
Huh?

00:09:45.672 --> 00:09:49.979
[DIAMANTE laughing]

00:09:50.013 --> 00:09:52.551
[DIAMANTE]
This is deplorable, Rebecca.

00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:55.858
You coward!
Why do you keep running?

00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:57.795
You're a fighter, aren't you?

00:09:57.829 --> 00:10:00.735
Sorry, I mean "gladiator"!

00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:04.308
I thought you were
coming here to kill me!

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.315
[REBECCA] I know I don't stand
a chance against Diamante.

00:10:12.023 --> 00:10:14.763
[REBECCA] I'm here to
accomplish only one thing.

00:10:14.796 --> 00:10:17.333
And that's to hand
this key over to Lucy!

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.722
[sighs, chuckles]

00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:29.926
[DIAMANTE] We put on
some good entertainment

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:32.932
back at the coliseum, didn't we?

00:10:35.337 --> 00:10:37.942
[DIAMANTE] But if you
won't fight me properly,

00:10:37.975 --> 00:10:41.248
it's time I dispose of you.

00:10:43.554 --> 00:10:45.757
[grunts]

00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:48.229

[REBECCA screams]

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:17.755
[panting]

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:28.209
Well, you have
nowhere to run now.

00:11:28.242 --> 00:11:31.182
Hmm. I know.

00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:34.789
Let's make this
a little more poetic.

00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:40.300
[DIAMANTE]
Rebecca. Wasn't your mother...

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:42.906
...also shot with a gun?

00:11:42.939 --> 00:11:44.174
[gasps]

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:05.349
[REBECCA]
Please!

00:12:06.418 --> 00:12:10.661
Help me, Soldier!

00:12:10.694 --> 00:12:13.900

--[KYROS grunts]

00:12:17.808 --> 00:12:20.212

[DIAMANTE]
Kyros?!

00:12:25.457 --> 00:12:27.460
Keep your hands off her!

00:12:27.493 --> 00:12:30.901
You have taken enough from me!

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:39.385
[REBECCA]
This statue before you.

00:12:39.418 --> 00:12:40.921
This man was a legend.

00:12:40.954 --> 00:12:42.223
He was the greatest gladiator

00:12:42.257 --> 00:12:45.931
in the whole history of
the Corrida Colosseum.

00:13:00.326 --> 00:13:03.165
[KYROS] I regret I couldn't
save your mother's life.

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:07.808
But I will devote mine to
protect yours whatever the cost!

00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:09.646
You'll learn to defend yourself.

00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:12.718
My mother told me I should never
hurt others no matter what!

00:13:12.752 --> 00:13:16.325
But you must protect yourself
from those who would hurt you.

00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:18.396
I'm nothing but a toy.

00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:20.934
Beaten by the wind and rain.

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.237
My body rusts.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.575
I don't know how long
I can continue!

00:13:24.608 --> 00:13:27.381
Become strong!

00:13:27.414 --> 00:13:29.184

Please forgive me, Rebecca.

[REBECCA gasps]

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.611
[KYROS] As a mere toy
without a future,

00:13:42.645 --> 00:13:46.653
the only thing I could do was
teach you to how to fight.

00:13:46.687 --> 00:13:48.188
I know it was hard on you.

00:13:48.222 --> 00:13:51.395
You're a gentle soul,
just like your mother.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.405
[KYROS]
But you need no longer suffer.

00:13:57.542 --> 00:14:01.582
Now, I'll fight for you.

00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:14.141
[DIAMANTE groans]
Is that so?

00:14:14.174 --> 00:14:17.981
You want to elaborate
on that, Kyros?

00:14:18.015 --> 00:14:19.417
[KYROS]
I won't just stand by.

00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:21.756
I'll make you pay
for your treachery!

[DIAMANTE gasps]
You sure you wanna do that?

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:30.874

00:18:12.316 --> 00:18:14.221
[LUFFY]
Hey, Rebecca.

00:18:15.089 --> 00:18:18.395
I bet you're stoked
to see your dad, huh?

00:18:22.169 --> 00:18:26.679
Hey, thanks for the key. See ya!

00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:39.872
[REBECCA]
Wait a second!

00:18:39.906 --> 00:18:42.511
Can I trust you
to stop Doflamingo?

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.155
Will you stop him?
Promise me, Lucy!

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:07.961
I'm not Lucy.

00:19:07.994 --> 00:19:09.364
[REBECCA gasps]

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.975
I'm Luffy! I'll be King
of the Pirates one day!

00:19:15.009 --> 00:19:16.879
[ALL gasp]

00:19:18.015 --> 00:19:20.620
[LUFFY]
So, there's no need to worry!

00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:29.872
What a load of nonsense!

00:19:29.906 --> 00:19:33.145
[KYROS] I am your only opponent,
so turn and face me!

00:19:33.178 --> 00:19:35.049
[grunts]

00:19:35.083 --> 00:19:37.754
You're getting in my way!

00:19:40.493 --> 00:19:43.165
Bastards! Pissing me off!

00:19:43.198 --> 00:19:46.104
You got a lot of nerve!

00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:50.580
I won't let you idiots
make your way to Doffy!

00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:55.056
[DIAMANTE]
You tremendous pain in the ass!

00:19:55.089 --> 00:19:58.697
And you! You traitorous brat!

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.466
[LAW]
Wait! Room!

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.238
[LAW]
Shambles!

00:20:03.973 --> 00:20:09.250
[DIAMANTE screams]
Dammit, Law!

00:20:20.974 --> 00:20:22.745
[LUFFY]
Upsie daisy!

00:20:22.778 --> 00:20:24.548
So this the place, huh?

00:20:24.582 --> 00:20:26.519
[LAW]
Yeah. Sure took long enough.

00:20:26.553 --> 00:20:29.423
Wow, your ability's
pretty handy, huh?

00:20:29.457 --> 00:20:34.000
[LAW] It is, but it also
takes a toll on my stamina.

00:20:34.033 --> 00:20:35.402
I suppose on the bright side,

00:20:35.435 --> 00:20:37.173
between the Sea
Prism Stone cuffs

00:20:37.207 --> 00:20:40.146
and you carrying my ass
all the way over here,

00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:43.987
I conserved enough
strength to pull it off.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.723
Scalpel.

00:20:48.496 --> 00:20:51.034
[LUFFY gasps]
What's wrong?

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.840
Take a look.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.072
[LAW] He used lead
bullets on purpose.

00:21:10.105 --> 00:21:11.776
Twisted jerk!

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:13.513
[LUFFY]
Hey, you okay?

00:21:13.547 --> 00:21:15.550
[LAW]
Don't worry about me.

00:21:15.584 --> 00:21:16.719
Fine then.

00:21:16.753 --> 00:21:20.259
Welp! Time to deliver
that ass kicking! Let's go!

00:21:20.293 --> 00:21:21.662
[LAW]
Wait!

00:21:21.695 --> 00:21:23.331
What, Traffy?

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:25.069
[LAW] Doflamingo isn't
someone you can pummel

00:21:25.102 --> 00:21:26.572
with your sheer will alone.

00:21:26.605 --> 00:21:28.141
You need to keep a level head.

00:21:28.175 --> 00:21:30.380
What? There's no way
I'm cooling off!

00:21:30.413 --> 00:21:31.649
I'm totally fired up!

00:21:31.683 --> 00:21:33.452
I'm telling you, if you
don't take my advice,

00:21:33.485 --> 00:21:35.122
you're gonna be
in for a bad time.

00:21:35.156 --> 00:21:36.659
[LUFFY]
Stop bossing me around!

00:21:36.692 --> 00:21:38.530
I promised Rebecca
I'd take care of him,

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:40.333
so butt-out and let me
handle it my way!

00:21:40.366 --> 00:21:42.103
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Uhh, reporting in.

00:21:42.136 --> 00:21:44.107
I have eyes on
Straw Hat and Law!

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.145
They're near the pool courtyard.

00:21:46.178 --> 00:21:47.213
[SUGAR]
Roger that.

00:21:47.246 --> 00:21:48.749
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Cuh-lick.

00:22:03.412 --> 00:22:06.819
[SUGAR]
Ten years, wasted.

00:22:07.655 --> 00:22:10.460
[SUGAR]
I spent a decade of my life

00:22:10.493 --> 00:22:13.799
increasing their numbers
little by little.

00:22:14.835 --> 00:22:18.643
[SUGAR] Thousands of
toy slaves at our disposal.

00:22:25.389 --> 00:22:28.596
But that imbecile

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.704
destroyed years of my
hard work in an instant.

00:22:35.611 --> 00:22:39.350
Hurry it up, Kanjuro!
We are in a crunch here!

00:22:39.383 --> 00:22:41.822
[KANJURO] Stay calm!
It's near completion!

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.141
[SUGAR]
Revenge won't take long.

00:22:51.174 --> 00:22:54.213
Just a brush of my hand and pow!

00:22:54.247 --> 00:22:56.920
Farewell, Straw Hat.

00:22:56.953 --> 00:22:57.855
In that split second,

00:22:57.888 --> 00:23:01.261
it'll be as though
you never existed.

00:23:01.294 --> 00:23:05.770
Everyone will forget you,
you trash.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.991
[NARRATOR]
Sugar approaches Luffy and Law

00:23:16.024 --> 00:23:17.561
with vengeance in her eyes.

00:23:17.594 --> 00:23:19.998
Usopp, realizing the
severity of the situation,

00:23:20.032 --> 00:23:22.737
takes action to protect
his unsuspecting allies.

00:23:22.771 --> 00:23:24.440
Taking aim at Sugar
from a distance,

00:23:24.473 --> 00:23:26.211
he places faith
in the impossible.

00:23:26.244 --> 00:23:30.285
The fate of Luffy and Law
falls on his sniping skills!

00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:32.156
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.626
"One Shot One Kill!

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.131
The Man Who
Will Save Dressrosa!"

00:23:36.164 --> 00:23:38.869
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
