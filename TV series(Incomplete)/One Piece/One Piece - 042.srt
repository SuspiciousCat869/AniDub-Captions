Gold Roger, the King
of the Pirates,

attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:12,879
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,582
You can have it.

7
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:18,918
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,454
Now, you just have to find it.

00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,859

There's nowhere else to run!

This is the room where
I make Nami draw all

of her sea charts for me.

[LUFFY]
This is Nami's room...

[ARLONG]
These sea charts

are what she's worked
on all these years.

She's absolutely brilliant.

The accuracy of her charts
is beyond comparison.

52
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,020
She's too good for
human trash like you!

53
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,589
Her talent should be used
solely for building up

Is that so?

And you're interfering

I don't care.

Really?

66

You want her to navigate

your pathetic little
schooner for you?

00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,906
Ha. I guess you truly have no
idea what a monumental waste

69
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,575
of talent that would be. Look.

70
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,577
There is no one else on
the face of the planet

71
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,982
that can draw sea charts with
such accuracy and efficiency.

72
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:12,752
That young lady has a gift.

73
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,761
And there really isn't anything
as ultimately regrettable

74
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,763
as wasting natural talent.

75
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,766
Staying here and drawing up
sea charts for me is her

76
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,669
only chance at living up
to her full potential!

In order for me to
attain world supremacy.

00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:41,147
Her sea charts are
absolutely vital!

80
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,218
She will continue drawing her
sea charts for my own ambitions!

81
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,820
And once her charts
give me full knowledge

82
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,722
of all the world's oceans,

83
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,226
we fishmen will be
totally invincible!

84
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,063
And the world shall
kneel before us!

85
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,732
The first step is this island.

86
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,802
Then we'll move on to
the whole East Blue.

What do you take her for?!

101
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,770
[ARLONG laughs]
She's an inferior creature,

102
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,272
but she has risen far
above her peers.

103
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,641
If all other humans
are sewer rats,

104
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,710
than she's a feisty
little kitten.

105
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,146
After all she is adorable.

106
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,316
She has her place and
it's here beside me.

107

Can't you understand that?

108
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,088
I can give her
everything she needs.

109
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,058
And the only thing she has
to do is continue drawing

110
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,795
those marvelous charts for me.

111
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:39,065
So Nami will forever
be my tool...

112
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,067
...or no...

113
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,169

Uh! What is that?!

00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,083

[USOPP]
It's a desk.

119

It was just a desk.

kind of talk from you!

What?! No!

126
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,969

Don't be stupid! I just, uh...

Well, you know...

00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,208
I thought it was Arlong
flying through the air.

130
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,344
[YOSAKU] What a load of crap!
You were scared! Admit it!

Admit what, you jerk?!

132
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,115
Admit that I know
Arlong's goin' down?!

133
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,717
There's no way that Big Bro
Luffy is gonna lose this fight!

you're doing?!

Why's all that stuff being
thrown outta there?!

[ARLONG] All right. As of today,
this will be your room.

Your desk. Your pens.

[ARLONG] If you ever try to
pull a stunt like this again,

I'll drag all those
villagers in here,

155
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,018
and make you watch as I
crush every single one...

156

[ARLONG]
Damn you!

00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,462
That's eight year's
worth of work!

and ambition!

Wow... This fight is
so freakin' intense.

164
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,817
Yeah... A fight to the death.

165
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,386
[YOSAKU]
Definitely.

166
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,563

Thank you.

167
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,608
[ARLONG]
Now you've gone too far!

168
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,278
[LUFFY]
You keep jabbering on about

169
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,014
how much better fishmen are,

170
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,383
and how much you need
those sea charts...

171
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,120
I don't understand anything
about that stuff,

172
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:25,124
but, I finally figured
out how to save her!

00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,568
There's only one way
for Nami to escape.

177
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,971
I've got to tear
this place apart!

178
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,474
Gum‐Gum...!

179
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,708
[ARLONG]
You fool...

180
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:46,479
Arlong Park cannot be brought
down by some inferior human.

181
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,482
Especially not by some
rubbery freak like you!

182
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,385
Shark Tooth Drill!!

183
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,185
[ARLONG yelling]

184
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,387
[LUFFY grunts]

185
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,889

[LUFFY grunts, panting]

193
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:44,070
Oh, no! It looks like Arlong
Park is coming down!

194
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,438
[VILLAGER B]
It's gonna collapse!

195
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,474
[VILLAGER C]
Everybody run for cover!

196
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,042
Big Sis! We gotta go!

197
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,377
But Luffy's still inside!

198
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,044
[JOHNNY]
Big Sis!

199
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,613
We can't! Luffy's still‐‐!

200
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,550
[gasps]

201
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:05,458
[NAMI]
Luffy!

202
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:28,414
[LUFFY] I finally figured
out how to save her...

203
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,317
This room isn't anything
but her jail cell...

204
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,320
There's only one way
for Nami to escape.

205
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,157
I've got to tear
this place apart!

206
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,598
[NAMI]
Luffy!

207
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,044
Luffy...

208
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,181
[SANJI gasps]

209
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,717
[ALL gasping]

210
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,189
Luffy...

[snoring]

212
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:26,205
[ZORO groaning]

213
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:30,209
What the hell?
What's that noise?

214
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,714
[ZORO]
Luffy...

215
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,598
Arlong Park has... fallen...

216
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,233
Big Bro...

217
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,736
I just wonder what
went on in there?

218
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,108
We gotta know who won.

219
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,279
With all that debris...
Looks like...

220
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,748
Luffy...

221
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,396
It's Luffy!

222
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,600
[JOHNNY, YOSAKU cry]
Big Bro!

223
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,770
[LUFFY panting]

224
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,578
He's just standing there...
What's wrong?

225
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,449
[panting]

226
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,454
[LUFFY]
Nami!

227
00:14:55,594 --> 00:15:00,165
Nami! You'll always
be my friend!

228
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,512
Yeah.

229
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,356
He really won?

230
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,458
He won.

231
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,193
He won!

232
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,828
[BOTH]
Big Bro won!

233
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,165
[VILLAGER B]
Arlong Park has fallen!

234
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,336
Yay!

235
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:41,273
Nojiko... Is all of this
really happening...?

236
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,676
Surely this is a dream.

237
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,779
[VILLAGERS cheering]

238
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:51,617
[VILLAGERS]
Luffy! Luffy! Luffy!

239
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,688
Luffy! Luffy! Luffy!

240
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,991
Good job Luffy! You almost
did as good as me!

241
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,859
Let's face it I'm
pretty much the star,

242
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,995
but I'll cheer for you anyway
because I'm super modest

243
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,632
and I don't wanna steal
your thunder! [laughs]

244
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,001
[SANJI] You really had
us going there, Luffy.

245
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,203
Start dealin' with
the bad guys quicker.

246
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,473
I almost had a heart attack...
You rubber jerk!

247
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,875
[VILLAGERS]
Luffy! Luffy!

248
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,579
Luffy! Luffy! Luffy!

249
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:27,753
[VILLAGERS]
Luffy! Luffy! Luffy! Luffy!

250
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,688
[USOPP laughs]

251
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,730
[VILLAGERS]
Luffy! Luffy!

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,265
[LUFFY groans]

253
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:45,237
[LUFFY laughing]
This is awesome!

254
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,739

[NAMI laughing]

258
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,787
Okay! Hold it right there!

259
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,454
[VILLAGERS gasping]

260
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,622
Damn! It's him!

261
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,459
[NEZUMI laughs]
What a lucky day today is!

262
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,560
Very nice!

263
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,063
I saw the entire fight
and I must say, good work!

264
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,465
I can only assume
that your victory here

265
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,434
was some sort of
bizarre accident.

266
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,435
I never thought that the fishmen

267
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,071
would lose to riff‐raff
like you and your crew.

268
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,974
However, now that Arlong
is out of the picture,

269
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,943
I'll be taking all the money
I was supposed to give to him

270
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,913
in addition to all the
treasure in Arlong Park.

271
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,648
Now drop your weapons!

272
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,452
Colonel Nezumi of Branch
16 gets all the credit!

273
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,821
[screams]

274
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,756
Zoro!

275
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,758
I see you're trying to rain
on these peoples' parade...

276
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,627
Now that's just plain rude.

277
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:45,064
[NEZUMI groaning]

278
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,568
[NEZUMI] Go on you scum...
Just try it...

279
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,671
You'll be sorry!
I promise you that!

280
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,807
[SANJI]
He's still talking?

281
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,646
This is for shooting Nojiko.

282
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,347
And also for mercilessly

283
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,950
destroying Bellemere's
tangerine orchard.

284
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,418
Huh?

285
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,656
Colonel!

286
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:15,961
Thanks Nami.

287
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,496
That felt good.

288
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,699
A thousand more
and we'll call it even!

289
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,670
[NEZUMI gasping]

290
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,505
[NEZUMI groaning]

291
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,541
What you're gonna do is
clean up after those fishmen.

292
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,010
Then you're gonna help to
rebuild the town of Gosa.

293
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,512
And you won't lay finger

294
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,881
on any of the money or
valuables in Arlong Park.

295
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,850
That's the island's money now!

296
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:38,517
Got it?!

297
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,552
Right! Yeah!

298
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,521
I'll do anything you say!

299
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,389
And there's one more thing!

300
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,658
Give me my money back, jerk!

301
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,994
I promise! I promise!

302
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,864
I'll give every berry back!

303
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,402
[NEZUMI]
I'll get you, you pirates!

304
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,539
Luffy is your Captain, right?

305
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,041
Well mark my friggin'
words, rubber man!

306
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,678
Major things are gonna happen.
'Cause you made me angry!

307
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,714
I swear you'll regret this!

308
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,584
I'll get my revenge!
Just you wait and see!

309
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,720
[SANJI]
Major things are gonna happen?

310
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:15,888
[LUFFY]
Yeah, how does he know

311
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,056
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates?

312
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:21,160
That's not what he means at
all. Are you really that dumb?

313
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,561
Hold on! What next?!

314
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,863
Are we in super big
trouble, or what?!

315
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,065
Hey! Hey! What do we do?!

316
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,066
[DOCTOR]
Hey, everyone!

317
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,036
Now's not the time to
keep this to ourselves!

318
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:34,573
We need to tell everyone on the
island what happened here today!

319
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:38,210
[VILLAGERS cheering]

320
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,513
[VILLAGER C]
Arlong Park has fallen!

321
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,683
[LUFFY] Hey, Zoro,
what's that on your chest?

322
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:45,751
Made ya look!

323
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,520

[NAMI laughs]

328
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,036
Good job, Nami.

329
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:05,771
To think...

330
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,774
Our island would be
saved by unruly pirates.

331
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,642
The world is strange.

332
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,718
Greetings and salutations
you pathetic little humans.

333
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,055
From this moment on, this entire
island and its inhabitants

334
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,723
are a part of my domain.

335
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,426
[FISHMEN cheering]

336
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,465
Genzo, help me.

337
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,735
I won't let you take her!

[ARLONG laughing]

340
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,816
But that's an Arlong tattoo.

341
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,752
Not you.

342
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,588
You can stop.

343
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:00,993
You carried our lives on
your shoulders for so long.

344
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,695
And you fought your heart out.

345
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,497
[NAMI]
Genzo...

346
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,546
[USOPP] And then the thing just
kinda exploded everywhere!

347
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,783
[LUFFY] It's so cool
when things go boom!

348
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,224
Now it's done.

349
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:37,796
The spirt of Bellemere...
can finally be at peace.

Hello?!

Hello?!

[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Yes. This is Navy Headquarters.

Right! Good! Hello!

00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,246
This is Colonel Nezumi
of Marine Branch 16.

355
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,016
Marine Code 00733!

356
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,151
I have a request!

357
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,887
There really is no reason
to shout. I can hear you.

358
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,756
Listen! There's a pirate
who wears a straw hat.

359
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,757
He's named Luffy.

360
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,760
Listen! There's a pirate
who wears a straw hat.

361
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,995
He's named Luffy.

362
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,830
I hereby declare that he

363
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,666
and his four crewmembers are
enemies of the government!

364
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,068
I hereby declare that he

365
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:19,237
and his four crewmembers are
enemies of the government!

366
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,006
Luffy... All right

367
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,207
[NEZUMI]
They managed to take down

368
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,044
the purportedly invincible
fishman Arlong at his home base.

369
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,914
Based on the grave threat
they present a large bounty

370
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:32,250
has been placed on their
captain, Straw Hat Luffy.

371
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,052
Transmitting photograph now.

372
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,854
Roger that.

373
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,125
[MARINE B]
Huh?

374
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,594
Couldn't you have taken
a better picture than that.

375
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,596
No... Sorry sir.

376
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:45,430
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Okay,

377
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,232
right after a quick
verification,

378
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,968
I'll send it in
for approval, sir.

379
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,069
Good!

380
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:55,040
Don't forget, he's a wanted
pirate! Dead or alive!

381
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,611
I want his face on posters
all over the world!

382
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,052
<i>♪All that's in my heart</i>

383
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,054

384
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,123

385
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,892

386
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,727

<i>As I watch the sunrise</i>

391
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,745
<i>I began to wonder</i>

392
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:38,617
<i>What could be the reason</i>

393
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,919

404
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,192
[ZORO] It's finally goodbye
to Cocoyashi Village.

405
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,194
[USOPP] Nami! Bet you're
happy to be onboard

406
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,962
with the great
Captain Usopp again!

407
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,132
[SANJI] You idiot! Nami is
joining me on a journey of love!

408
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,900
[LUFFY]
No way! Raw ham and melon.

409
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:33,171
[NAMI] Bellemere, it took eight
years, but we're finally free.

410
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,006
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

411
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,842
"Setting Out with a smile!

412
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,377
Farewell, Hometown
Cocoyashi Village!"

413
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,980
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates!
