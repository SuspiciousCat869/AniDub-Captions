[TASHIGI] Get back? But where
are you going, Smoker?

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:51.363
Vergo! That's who
you're after, right?

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:52.998
[SMOKER]
I can't let him get away.

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:54.834
The law won't see
that traitor punished

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:56.101
the way he deserves to be.

00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:57.903
I have to handle it myself.

00:13:57.937 --> 00:14:00.606
Nobody screws around
with my Navy.

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:02.107
Don't you have any pride?

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:05.044
A Marine would rather die than
beg a pirate for their life!

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:06.212
[TASHIGI]
I don't care!

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:08.881
We have other things to worry
about--and other people!

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:11.150
If we get killed over
our stupid pride,

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:13.352
then all of our men
are as good as dead.

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:15.221
What about the children?

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:24.063
You're going to die here
along with the rest, Law.

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:27.766
[VERGO]
Hm?

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:43.182
He's not dead yet.

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:45.718
[VERGO] It's past time
to give up, Smoker.

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:49.588
We've been over this. You know
you're no match for me.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:56.962
[yells]

00:14:58.464 --> 00:15:00.599
What are you doing, you fool?

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:05.271
Bad call. Spreading
yourself thin?

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:06.839
You shouldn't do that
when you're up against

00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:08.274
a better Haki user.

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:09.842
[yells]

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:17.650
It just makes it
easier to hit you.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:34.166
Why do you keep using
your Devil Fruit power?

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:37.002
You're not thinking
straight right now.

00:15:37.036 --> 00:15:38.637
This isn't like you.

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:40.873
You always have your
head in the game.

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:45.110
[gasps]

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:47.680
Enough. I'm done playin' around.

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:55.387
[yells]

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.762
[VERGO]
Demon Bamboo!

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:23.449
You want to kill me so badly
for betraying you and the Navy.

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:26.952
But it was stupid to take me on
when you're not strong enough.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.654
Recklessness won't
save your people

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:30.756
or make them proud of you.

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:38.330
It's over now.

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:50.209
[LAW]
Well done, Smoker.

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:52.745
I can take things from here.

00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:55.514
Thanks for keeping
your end of the deal.

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:56.849
[gasps]

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:01.954
[VERGO]
Now I get it, you bastard.

00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:04.456
That's why you
turned into smoke.

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:11.230
This makes us even, Law.

00:17:11.263 --> 00:17:14.066
Will you finish him already?

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.834
[LAW]
You really can't stand the idea

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.937
of owing a pirate, can you?

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.806
It's unworthy of a Marine.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.475
I'm just glad my people
aren't here to see this.

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:27.479
[LAW] And yet, I'm only alive
because of what you did.

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:34.353
Now it's time to end this.

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:37.322
Mr. Vergo.

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:38.991
[VERGO]
Pathetic fool.

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:42.394
It's about time you remember
your place in the world.

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:45.731
[LAW] Tell yourself whatever
lies you need to hear.

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:47.232
But I don't think
you're gonna be sitting

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:49.768
on the throne of power forever.

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:51.637
Either of you.

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:55.474
Yeah, I know you're listening.

00:17:55.507 --> 00:17:57.342
Hello, Joker.

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:06.718
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:10.089
[LAW] I think you should know
that Vergo is as good as dead.

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:12.991
You're about to lose
your right-hand man.

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:16.028
Meanwhile, Straw Hat's
gonna take care of Caesar,

00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:20.132
and that means you can kiss
your supply of SAD goodbye.

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:23.735
You didn't see this coming
because you were overconfident.

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.571
You always have been.

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:28.707
So please, feel free to keep
cackling like an arrogant idiot

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.809
while you plot your next move.

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:32.444
Enjoy it while you can,

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:35.747
but you won't be laughing
for very much longer.

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:39.585
'Cause we're gonna
do the unthinkable.

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:45.357
[DOFLAMINGO laughing]

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.625
[DOFLAMINGO]
You do a pretty decent job

00:18:46.658 --> 00:18:50.362
of acting like a
tough guy, runt. Heh.

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:53.966
But I think you're the one
who's being overconfident here.

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:57.136
Take a good look at Vergo.

00:18:57.169 --> 00:19:00.839
Pissing him off is
never a good idea.

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:10.349
[DOFLAMINGO] Think about
what happened last time.

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:13.819
How did that turn out
for you? Not very well.

00:19:13.852 --> 00:19:17.422
You crossed Vergo, and what
did he do to you then?

00:19:17.456 --> 00:19:23.362
Heh. You remember. I'm sure
it was quite traumatic.

00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:27.232
Are you afraid of him?
You must be.

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.868
Even with your incomparable
swordsmanship,

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:33.205
with his Haki, he can
block your every attack.

00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:36.041
Whether we're talking
status or strength,

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:39.411
the sad fact is, you're
no match for Vergo,

00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:41.747
and never will be.

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.783
[growls]

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:51.957
[VERGO]
Let's do this.

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:57.356
[LAW] It's been two years now,
since the War in Marineford.

00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:04.429
[LAW] Tell me, did anyone
actually accomplish anything?

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:08.300
All you did was maintain
the status quo.

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:13.505
And Whitebeard? All he did
was bring an end to the era.

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:18.243
The Navy regrouped and
bolstered its strength.

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:22.114
But none of the big players
have taken action.

00:21:22.147 --> 00:21:24.616
It's like everyone has been
holding their breath,

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.585
just preparing.

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:30.689
That war was only a beginning.
It was a prologue.

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:39.097
[LAW] You always told
me that it was coming.

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.500
That a new era would arrive,

00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:44.736
borne along by an
unstoppable tide.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.472
The age of the daring ones.

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:52.577
Here we are, Joker.

00:21:52.611 --> 00:21:54.813
I opened the gate.

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:04.756
[LAW] The gears are broken--
there is no turning back.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.792
For anyone.

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.870
[NARRATOR]
After a single attack from Law

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.772
instantly turns
the tide of battle,

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:23.408
the Straw Hat Pirates
hasten to make their escape.

00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:25.177
Lashing out in a fit of rage,

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.878
Caesar Clown unleashes
a vicious,

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:29.081
sweeping assault on
friend and foe alike,

00:22:29.114 --> 00:22:32.484
then decides to make Luffy
his number-one target!

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:34.486
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:38.290
"Caesar's Defeat!
The Powerful Grizzly Magnum!"

00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:40.992
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
