â™ª Opening Song â™ª

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.959
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.929
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:40.266
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.303
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body became rubber

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:45.004
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:48.708
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:52.912
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.651
[NARRATOR] After a series
of fierce battles,

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.487
the Straw Hat Pirates
have reached the waters

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.390
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.993
Their first stop is the
island of Punk Hazard.

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:10.563
There, they face off against
the mad scientist, Caesar Clown,

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.599
who has unleashed
a terrifying bioweapon

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.601
known as "Land of the Dead."

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:17.604
The Straw Hats and Law dash
through a massive laboratory.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.572
Their objective is
to kidnap Caesar,

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:22.675
free his captives,
and escape the island.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.144
[laughs]

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:27.480
Capture me if you can,
but I'm well protected.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:30.450
Doflamingo. The Four Emperors.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.652
Tell me, do you truly
have the guts

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.220
to pick a fight with them?

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.989
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.957
[CAESAR CLOWN]
I don't think you do, Straw Hat.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:40.293
What'd you say?

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.661
[CAESAR CLOWN]
You should get out of my way

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:43.863
while you still have a chance.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.206
[screams]

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:58.711
[LUFFY]
I'm pickin' a fight.

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:01.781
And that's what I've been
doin' my whole life!

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:10.190
[LUFFY] "A Surprising Outcome!
White Hunter vs. Vergo!"

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:14.928
[SUBORDINATES]
No! Not the Master!

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.374
[growls]

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:32.445
[CAESAR CLOWN] Ow, ow, ow!
My nose! You broke my nose!

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.814
Damn it! Do you know
how much this hurts?

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.717
How dare you,
you little brat! Ow!

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.222
Agh! Idiot! Were you listening
to a single word I said?

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:45.124
There's no chance in hell you're
going to get away with this!

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:47.894
Agh! I told you who
I have backing me.

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:50.797
Oh! The craziest
pirate of them all!

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.099
Are you sure you want to
face a deadly Warlord

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:55.902
like Don Quixote Doflamingo?

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.604
He's the New World puppeteer.

00:03:57.637 --> 00:04:00.807
The one who pulls all the
strings behind the scenes.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.209
Weapons, drugs, you name it.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.378
If there's an illicit
transaction taking place,

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.647
he's involved somehow.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.449
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:11.951
[CAESAR CLOWN] He's the
mastermind of the underground,

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:14.320
with connections to every
notorious person

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:15.989
you can think of. Ha!

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:19.425
A minnow like you is no match
for a shark like Doflamingo.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.762
He could chew you up and spit
you out in a matter of minutes.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:26.833
He'll take you down, and all
of your friends along with you.

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:28.167
[growls]

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:31.704
Eeh. It's not too late though!

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:34.240
I can still spare you
if you apologize now.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.809
You don't want to do
something you'll regret!

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.913
Uh. Think carefully
about this, Straw Hat.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.448
Do you really want
to pit yourself

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:45.184
against the monsters
I've got in my corner?

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:46.419
Well?

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:49.455
Hey! Are you listening?
Say something!

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:50.657
They'll come for you.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.359
The Four Emperors.
And the Warlords, too.

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:56.896
They'll rip you limb from limb
and dump you in the sea!

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:58.464
Just a quick apology.

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:01.301
Do it right now and I can
let you off the hook!

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:06.739
Gastille!

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:10.843
[laughs]

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.512
You lost your chance, you fool!

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:13.680
[SUBORDINATES]
Hell yeah!

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:17.116
A gas burner attack!
Those melt steel!

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.218
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:20.553
I wonder what's left.

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:24.123
Aww. Did he melt away
or burn into ash?

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.024
Eh?

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.959
[CAESAR CLOWN screams]

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.199
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
let's take a second.

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:34.834
This is a lot to process.

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.336
You're still a rookie
in the New World,

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:38.705
so I'm sure none of
this feels real to you.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:41.741
But one of those monsters
is right here in the lab.

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.209
That's right: Vergo!

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:46.646
Nobody can stand for long
against his Armament Haki.

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:47.980
They're all goners.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.049
Smoker and that fool Law.

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:52.685
Not to mention your crew.

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.254
I don't understand. I told you
you're all going to die.

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:56.823
Why aren't you listening to me?

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:59.258
How about you listen to me?

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:04.030
[LUFFY]
I'm not scared of you!

00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:16.376
Watch it, Smoker.

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.444
[SMOKER yells]

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:24.951
Vergo!

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:29.522
How dare you screw with
the Navy, you filthy traitor!

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:30.857
Are you truly so deluded

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.693
you think you're strong
enough to defeat me?

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.447
You never learn, do you?

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.116
Maybe it[ll help if I
put this very simply.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.118
My fighting skills and
Haki are superior,

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.320
and you are going to die.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:09.195
[yells]

00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:10.463
Too slow!

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:32.151
White Blow!

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:37.423
[gasps]

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.327
[SMOKER yells]

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.909
Is getting your revenge
really worth all this?

00:07:56.943 --> 00:08:00.079
You're that angry with me
for betraying the Navy?

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:02.949
[SMOKER] If you have to ask
that, you'll never understand.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.718
Were you ever truly a Marine?

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:09.188
I will end you, pirate scum.

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:10.990
Repeatedly saying
you're going to kill me

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:13.092
won't actually make it happen.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:15.895
You don't seem to
understand that.

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:23.069
[NARRATOR] The Land of
the Dead is a lethal gas

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:26.405
that petrifies any human
before it kills them.

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:30.610
It has covered the island and
is now filling the laboratory.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.514
[TASHIGI]
Hey, where are you going now?

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:36.215
If you were headed in
the right direction,

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:37.984
we should've caught up
with the kids already!

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:40.486
You're hurt! Save your strength
and shut your mouth.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.188
I don't need your directions.

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:45.091
[TASHIGI]
No! Not that way!

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:46.792
Stop! You went too far!

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.628
How can you mess up
something this simple?

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:50.329
[ZORO]
Just stop talking!

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:55.268
We need to hurry, kids!
Keep running, okay?

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:58.604
My head feels all foggy,
like I just came out of a dream.

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.573
Yes, that's a side-effect
of the sedatives,

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:02.575
but I assure you they're
perfectly harmless.

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:04.710
Run as fast as you can,
Marines, and remember:

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.946
Our number one priority
is to protect the children

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:08.147
and get them to safety!

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:08.981
[MARINES]
We've got them!

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:13.352
Just leave it to us, sir! Yeah!

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.554
Mocha, stay with me.

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:17.256
You're gonna be all right soon.
Just a little longer now.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.725
Come on, get it all out, okay?

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.263
[NARRATOR] The survivors
are making their way

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:26.299
toward the first floor
of Building R,

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.634
the location of the
last remaining exit

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:31.804
and ground zero for Luffy's
battle with Caesar.

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:33.839
Meanwhile, Kin'emon continues

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:35.575
his desperate search
for his son.

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:36.909
[screams]

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:40.746
What have I done to
my poor Momonosuke?

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.948
He what?!

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:45.284
Momonosuke has taken the form
of a dragon? Are you sure?

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:48.754
[GINKO] Uh-huh. It's a
secret, but it's true.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.792
Is life truly so cruel?

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:56.462
Did I take my blade to
the body of my own kin?

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.800
Momonosuke!

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:03.536
I am the vilest monster
that ever lived!

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:05.304
[BROOK]
Kin'emon, please listen.

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:06.772
You can't go back!

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:09.208
That area is surely filled
with gas by now!

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:10.710
[screams]

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:13.713
[BROOK] There it is! Quick!
We must turn around at once!

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:16.415
A warrior's spirit will guide
him through any obstacle,

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.818
be it deadly gas
or a blazing fire!

00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:20.052
Momonosuke!

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:24.357
[BROOK] Warrior spirit or not,
that's impossible!

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:31.831
The Sea Prism Stone handcuffs.
They could be in this room.

00:10:31.864 --> 00:10:34.467
Hmm.... No, I don't
think they are.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.702
The "Usopp alarm" going off
in my head is telling me

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:37.737
that there's nothing in there

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.373
and I'd be better off
stealthily running away.

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:43.442
Yeah, that's it. I'll just
pretend I checked in there.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.112
I'll say, "I found a suspicious
room and looked inside

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:48.214
for the Sea Prism
Stone handcuffs"...

00:10:48.247 --> 00:10:49.348
[SUBORDINATES]
Huh?

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:51.550
..."but they weren't there!"

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:57.490
[USOPP]
Hm?

00:10:57.523 --> 00:10:59.158
[SUBORDINATES]
Huh?

00:11:00.693 --> 00:11:01.994
[USOPP]
Hmm?

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:03.629
[SUBORDINATES]
Huh?

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:07.900
He's with the Straw Hats!

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:11.837
[USOPP] Gah! Why is this
always happening to me?!

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:53.179
White... Blow!

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:08.928
Are you satisfied now?
Have you had enough?

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:31.283
You can cling to the
thought of getting justice

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:33.319
as tightly as you want.

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:36.388
But as long as you're weak,
you will never have it.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.585
What do you want?

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:14.627
I just need to get my
heart back from you.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.063
Once I have it, I can
kick your ass, Vergo.

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.398
Easily!

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:22.735
I'm starting to get very
tired of repeating myself.

00:13:22.768 --> 00:13:25.938
It's Mr. Vergo. Got it?

00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:28.974
[screams, groans]

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:44.323
[SMOKER]
Until I get back,

00:13:44.356 --> 00:13:46.492
I'm leaving you in charge
of the men, understood?

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:49.295
[TASHIGI] Get back? But where
are you going, Smoker?

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:51.363
Vergo! That's who
you're after, right?

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:52.998
[SMOKER]
I can't let him get away.

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:54.834
The law won't see
that traitor punished

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:56.101
the way he deserves to be.

00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:57.903
I have to handle it myself.

00:13:57.937 --> 00:14:00.606
Nobody screws around
with my Navy.

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:02.107
Don't you have any pride?

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:05.044
A Marine would rather die than
beg a pirate for their life!

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:06.212
[TASHIGI]
I don't care!

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:08.881
We have other things to worry
about--and other people!

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:11.150
If we get killed over
our stupid pride,

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:13.352
then all of our men
are as good as dead.

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:15.221
What about the children?

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:24.063
You're going to die here
along with the rest, Law.

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:27.766
[VERGO]
Hm?

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:43.182
He's not dead yet.

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:45.718
[VERGO] It's past time
to give up, Smoker.

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:49.588
We've been over this. You know
you're no match for me.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:56.962
[yells]

00:14:58.464 --> 00:15:00.599
What are you doing, you fool?

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:05.271
Bad call. Spreading
yourself thin?

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:06.839
You shouldn't do that
when you're up against

00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:08.274
a better Haki user.

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:09.842
[yells]

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:17.650
It just makes it
easier to hit you.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:34.166
Why do you keep using
your Devil Fruit power?

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:37.002
You're not thinking
straight right now.

00:15:37.036 --> 00:15:38.637
This isn't like you.

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:40.873
You always have your
head in the game.

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:45.110
[gasps]

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:47.680
Enough. I'm done playin' around.

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:55.387
[yells]

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.762
[VERGO]
Demon Bamboo!

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:23.449
You want to kill me so badly
for betraying you and the Navy.

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:26.952
But it was stupid to take me on
when you're not strong enough.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.654
Recklessness won't
save your people

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:30.756
or make them proud of you.

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:38.330
It's over now.

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:50.209
[LAW]
Well done, Smoker.

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:52.745
I can take things from here.

00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:55.514
Thanks for keeping
your end of the deal.

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:56.849
[gasps]

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:01.954
[VERGO]
Now I get it, you bastard.

00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:04.456
That's why you
turned into smoke.

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:11.230
This makes us even, Law.

00:17:11.263 --> 00:17:14.066
Will you finish him already?

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.834
[LAW]
You really can't stand the idea

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.937
of owing a pirate, can you?

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.806
It's unworthy of a Marine.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.475
I'm just glad my people
aren't here to see this.

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:27.479
[LAW] And yet, I'm only alive
because of what you did.

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:34.353
Now it's time to end this.

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:37.322
Mr. Vergo.

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:38.991
[VERGO]
Pathetic fool.

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:42.394
It's about time you remember
your place in the world.

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:45.731
[LAW] Tell yourself whatever
lies you need to hear.

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:47.232
But I don't think
you're gonna be sitting

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:49.768
on the throne of power forever.

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:51.637
Either of you.

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:55.474
Yeah, I know you're listening.

00:17:55.507 --> 00:17:57.342
Hello, Joker.

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:06.718
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:10.089
[LAW] I think you should know
that Vergo is as good as dead.

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:12.991
You're about to lose
your right-hand man.

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:16.028
Meanwhile, Straw Hat's
gonna take care of Caesar,

00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:20.132
and that means you can kiss
your supply of SAD goodbye.

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:23.735
You didn't see this coming
because you were overconfident.

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.571
You always have been.

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:28.707
So please, feel free to keep
cackling like an arrogant idiot

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.809
while you plot your next move.

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:32.444
Enjoy it while you can,

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:35.747
but you won't be laughing
for very much longer.

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:39.585
'Cause we're gonna
do the unthinkable.

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:45.357
[DOFLAMINGO laughing]

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.625
[DOFLAMINGO]
You do a pretty decent job

00:18:46.658 --> 00:18:50.362
of acting like a
tough guy, runt. Heh.

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:53.966
But I think you're the one
who's being overconfident here.

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:57.136
Take a good look at Vergo.

00:18:57.169 --> 00:19:00.839
Pissing him off is
never a good idea.

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:10.349
[DOFLAMINGO] Think about
what happened last time.

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:13.819
How did that turn out
for you? Not very well.

00:19:13.852 --> 00:19:17.422
You crossed Vergo, and what
did he do to you then?

00:19:17.456 --> 00:19:23.362
Heh. You remember. I'm sure
it was quite traumatic.

00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:27.232
Are you afraid of him?
You must be.

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.868
Even with your incomparable
swordsmanship,

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:33.205
with his Haki, he can
block your every attack.

00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:36.041
Whether we're talking
status or strength,

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:39.411
the sad fact is, you're
no match for Vergo,

00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:41.747
and never will be.

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.783
[growls]

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:51.957
[VERGO]
Let's do this.

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:57.356
[LAW] It's been two years now,
since the War in Marineford.

00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:04.429
[LAW] Tell me, did anyone
actually accomplish anything?

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:08.300
All you did was maintain
the status quo.

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:13.505
And Whitebeard? All he did
was bring an end to the era.

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:18.243
The Navy regrouped and
bolstered its strength.

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:22.114
But none of the big players
have taken action.

00:21:22.147 --> 00:21:24.616
It's like everyone has been
holding their breath,

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.585
just preparing.

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:30.689
That war was only a beginning.
It was a prologue.

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:39.097
[LAW] You always told
me that it was coming.

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.500
That a new era would arrive,

00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:44.736
borne along by an
unstoppable tide.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.472
The age of the daring ones.

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:52.577
Here we are, Joker.

00:21:52.611 --> 00:21:54.813
I opened the gate.

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:04.756
[LAW] The gears are broken--
there is no turning back.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.792
For anyone.

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.870
[NARRATOR]
After a single attack from Law

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.772
instantly turns
the tide of battle,

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:23.408
the Straw Hat Pirates
hasten to make their escape.

00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:25.177
Lashing out in a fit of rage,

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.878
Caesar Clown unleashes
a vicious,

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:29.081
sweeping assault on
friend and foe alike,

00:22:29.114 --> 00:22:32.484
then decides to make Luffy
his number-one target!

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:34.486
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:38.290
"Caesar's Defeat!
The Powerful Grizzly Magnum!"

00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:40.992
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
