1
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:43,658
[GOLD ROGER] The world.
What a glorious place!

2
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:49,039
Seek freedom and it will lie
stretched out before your eyes.

3
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:53,543
If the endless dream guides
your restless spirit, seize it!

4
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:57,213
Raise your flag, and stand tall!

5
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,052
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)</i>

6
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:05,221
<i>I think back to the time</i>
<i>when my search first began--</i>

7
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:07,599
<i>I left behind those</i>
<i>shores of sand--</i>

8
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:12,145
<i>For the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

9
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:15,106
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

10
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,400
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

11
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:25,700
<i>See the light I have searched</i>
<i>for everywhere (ere-ere!)</i>

12
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:28,203
<i>When the summer sun is shining,</i>

13
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:30,830
<i>shaking the sails</i>
<i>of my heart, I know...</i>

14
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:35,835
<i>(Fly away glum blue sea)</i>

15
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:38,254
<i>A brand-new world</i>
<i>that had been hiding</i>

16
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:40,882
<i>has opened up its</i>
<i>doors for me to go...</i>

17
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:45,261
<i>(Fly away glum blue sky)</i>

18
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:47,806
<i>Swaying in the troubled waves--</i>

19
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,266
<i>From all despair,</i>
<i>I can be saved--</i>

20
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,561
<i>For the horizon</i>
<i>on the other side is--</i>

21
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,814
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</i>

22
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:57,899
<i>Is what I aim for!</i>

23
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:00,944
<i>And though I've traveled far</i>
<i>from where my search began--</i>

24
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:03,446
<i>Over seas of green</i>
<i>and shores of sand--</i>

25
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,159
<i>Through the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

26
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:10,954
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

27
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:13,248
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

28
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:18,336
<i>See the light I have</i>
<i>searched for everywhere!</i>

29
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:34,144
This isn't the exit.
It's the entrance!

30
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:36,771
[laughing]

31
00:02:38,148 --> 00:02:40,233
[LUFFY]
Sky island!

32
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:45,655
Heso.

33
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:51,036
[PAGAYA]
Gang way!

34
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:53,079
Stopping this thing
is a bit of a trick!

35
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:56,541
[yelping]

36
00:02:56,624 --> 00:02:58,626
[groaning]

37
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,087
[PAGAYA] My goodness.
I-Is everyone all right?

38
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:02,756
You're the one who crashed!

39
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:05,592
[NAMI] Riding a waver
requires finesse, Luffy!

40
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:06,843
[laughs]

41
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:09,137
Oh, Nami, you're a
vision riding that waver!

42
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,473
That's incredible!
I can't believe it!

43
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:12,724
This is her first time?

44
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:15,769
Yeah! How come she can
do it and I can't?

45
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:23,902
Hey, guys. Any of you
know where Nami is?

46
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,156
I'm worried. Do you
think she's okay?

47
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,868
I have my concerns, but I can't
say one way or the other.

48
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:34,662
Uh, what're you talkin' about?

49
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:37,457
In the clouds, there's a
place called the Upper Yard

50
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,793
that no one is ever
allowed to step foot on.

51
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:41,795
It's not too far away.

52
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:45,715
[USOPP] What's so bad
that no one can ever

53
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,467
go over to this island?

54
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,719
Is it full of monsters?

55
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:50,970
It's sacred ground.

56
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:53,264
Sacred ground?

57
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:56,142
But it's so much
more than just that.

58
00:03:57,394 --> 00:04:00,522
It's the island...
where God lives.

59
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,235
[LUFFY]
"The Forbidden Sacred Ground!

60
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:09,489
The Island Where God Lives
and Heaven's Judgement!"

61
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:11,991
There's actually a God?!

62
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:13,618
And he lives on an
island up here

63
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:15,954
that no one's
allowed to walk on?

64
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:19,666
[CONIS]
Right.

65
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:21,668
You mean the God? The same one
from all the old stories?

66
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:24,587
And he actually lives on the
island next door to you?

67
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:25,797
He does.

68
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,173
I'm sure that everyone
noticed the big sign

69
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:28,967
that said "Godland Skypiea."

70
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,013
That means this land is ruled
by the almighty God Eneru.

71
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:35,223
God's name is Eneru?

72
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:40,228
He knows and sees everything.
He's truly omniscient.

73
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:41,730
[USOPP]
Everything?

74
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:45,859
He keeps his all-seeing eyes
focused on everyone. Always.

75
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:46,735
For real?

76
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:47,736
Like right now?

77
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,279
[CONIS]
Oh, yes.

78
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:50,780
[screams]

79
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:54,159
I hate it when people stare
at me and I can't see them!

80
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:56,369
"God," huh...

81
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:59,497
Wait, you mean, you don't
believe in God? But why not?

82
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:01,374
Well, for me, it's not
a matter of belief.

83
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,418
I don't see proof of it
one way or another.

84
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:05,795
And to be honest,
I don't really care to.

85
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,297
But if you want to, go ahead.

86
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,175
It's not up to me to deny
anyone their little beliefs.

87
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:13,178
So, Conis, if this guy Eneru
lives in the Upper Yard,

88
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:16,306
and it's so close, then you must
have set eyes on him before.

89
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,142
Absolutely not. It's
forbidden to go there.

90
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:20,727
The Upper Yard is sacred ground

91
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,104
and a place only for
our God to rest.

92
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:24,647
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:32,197
[NAMI] I can't get over
the size of those trees.

94
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,656
Wait a minute.

95
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,452
So they do have earthen
ground up here.

96
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:43,875
I see.

97
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,711
A place we're not allowed to
go to no matter what, huh?

98
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:47,962
Ah!

99
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:49,047
I've seen that look in
your eyes before, Luffy,

100
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,382
and it always gets
us into trouble!

101
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:51,966
When the lady says
we can't go there

102
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,344
because it's sacred or whatever,
that's exactly what she means!

103
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:55,720
We cannot go there!

104
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:57,847
I am not letting you drag me
down with you this time!

105
00:05:57,931 --> 00:06:00,725
No. Hey. Heh.

106
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:03,228
I understand we're not
supposed to go there.

107
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:04,604
[chuckles]

108
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:07,482
Come on!

109
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:11,277
You really think I'm the kinda
guy who would do that? Heh.

110
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:13,905
[STRAW HATS]
Yes. Absolutely.

111
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,408
[LUFFY]
Hey, wait.

112
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:17,867
If this guy is God, then
shouldn't he forgive you

113
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:19,160
no matter what you do?

114
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:20,787
Walking around on some
forbidden island

115
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,372
doesn't seem like
a big deal to me.

116
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:23,581
No.

117
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:25,333
Breaking any law set
forth by our almighty

118
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,877
is nothing less than sacrilege.

119
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:30,839
[LUFFY] So I guess it
doesn't matter either way.

120
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,677
[CHOPPER] He'd go even if it
meant he'd die in the process.

121
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,762
Tell me, I assume there
are some dramatic

122
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:40,724
and vicious consequences
of entering the Upper Yard,

123
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:42,225
do you know what they are?

124
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:45,395
Yeah. I do.

125
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:46,730
What are they?

126
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:48,565
[PAGAYA] It is our belief
that if you go there,

127
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:50,734
you will not return alive.

128
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:53,028
Everyone who goes there dies?

129
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:56,531
I must admit, I am just
as worried about Nami

130
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:57,907
as all of you are.

131
00:06:57,991 --> 00:07:01,453
I hope she hasn't sailed
too close to the Upper Yard.

132
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:02,370
[SANJI gasps]

133
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:03,538
[SANJI]
Nami! Nami...

134
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:05,415
All right. Let's go
and find her!

135
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:06,583
We're wasting time!

136
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,876
[USOPP] You don't care
about saving Nami!

137
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,669
You just wanna satisfy
your twisted urge

138
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:12,672
to do the exact opposite
of what you've been told!

139
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:15,675
[SANJI]
Nami!

140
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,351
[NAMI] Those are the biggest
trees I've ever seen in my life.

141
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:26,311
They've gotta be
hundreds of years old.

142
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:30,148
That, or things grow bigger
a few miles up in the sky.

143
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:32,609
And they're so tall.

144
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,821
I can't even see
where they top out.

145
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:38,865
[MAN A]
I'm positive.

146
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:40,200
The treasure has got to be here.

147
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:42,077
[MAN B]
But I don't see anything.

148
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,036
[MAN A]
Look harder.

149
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,080
We didn't come here for nothing.

150
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:48,333
[MAN A]
It's close! It has to be!

151
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,459
[MAN B]
But where?

152
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:51,169
[NAMI]
There are people up there.

153
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:53,963
[MAN A] We're getting warmer.
Pick up the pace!

154
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,094
[NAMI]
The voices came from over here.

155
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,304
Luffy, we gotta get going.

156
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:03,765
[LUFFY] Yeah, I know.
Just gimme a second.

157
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:05,308
Fine. Don't listen to me.

158
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:07,435
But you're gonna feel awful
if something bad happens to Nami

159
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,521
while you're busy
stuffing your face.

160
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:11,606
The food'll be here
when we get back!

161
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,817
[LUFFY]
Mh-hm. I'm right behind you.

162
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:16,152
Conis, I know this guy,

163
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:17,612
and I could be here
all day waiting on him.

164
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:19,280
Could you tell me how to
get to the Upper Yard?

165
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:20,907
I gotta go help Nami.

166
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,992
But you don't know for sure.

167
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:23,910
[SANJI]
Hm?

168
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:24,994
About Nami.

169
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:26,204
She might just be
out on the clouds

170
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:28,123
and nowhere near the Upper Yard.

171
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:29,541
I mean...

172
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,545
[CONIS] I can't explain how
devastating it could be to us

173
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:36,089
to incur the wrath
of our God Eneru.

174
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,551
This Eneru doesn't sound like

175
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:41,469
the nicest God you
could've found.

176
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:45,682
He doesn't have to be. He's God.

177
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,563
[NAMI]
Huh?

178
00:08:56,317 --> 00:09:00,447
What a wreck. Looks like
there's no one on board.

179
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:08,413
[NAMI]
Hmm...

180
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:13,543
Claw marks. And something
big by the looks of them.

181
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:17,547
[MAN A]
I'm positive.

182
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,132
The treasure has
got to be here.

183
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:20,800
[MAN B]
But I don't see anything.

184
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:21,760
[MAN A]
Look harder.

185
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:24,846
We didn't come here for nothing.

186
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:26,389
It's close! It has to be!

187
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:29,100
Wait, those voices are
coming from that shell.

188
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:30,352
[MAN A]
We're getting warmer.

189
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:32,020
Pick up the pace!

190
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:35,857
Crazy. It sounds like there's
a person trapped inside.

191
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:44,282
[MAN A] We have to keep a record
of everything we find and do.

192
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:47,702
Who knows how valuable
the information could be?

193
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:51,081
I see. So this shell
can record voices.

194
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:53,375
[MAN B]
Forget this. I'm outta here.

195
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,419
I can't stop shaking.
I'm so scared.

196
00:09:56,503 --> 00:10:00,173
Can you feel that?
That's God's anger.

197
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:03,843
[MAN A] Wait, I hear
something. What is it?

198
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:07,222
[MAN B]
It's... It's God!

199
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:10,058
[MAN B, MAN A screaming]

200
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,691
[NAMI]
Were they killed...

201
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,070
...by God?

202
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:35,000
This place, it's so creepy.

203
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,044
That's it. I think it's
time to get outta here.

204
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:40,296
[gasps]

205
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:47,971
[ZABO]
Help!

206
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:52,809
[ZABO]
Somebody help me!

207
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:04,404
[LUFFY] Time to set sail
for the place of no return

208
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:06,865
that we're not supposed
to go to anyway!

209
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:08,658
[PAGAYA]
Hmm...

210
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:12,454
Ah, I'm so very sorry.
There's no headwind blowing.

211
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:14,247
If you were to set
sail at this moment,

212
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,249
you'd spend an extraordinary
amount of time

213
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:17,667
getting to the Upper Yard.

214
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:18,918
[LUFFY]
What?

215
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:20,170
[USOPP] So, what's an
extraordinary amount?

216
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:22,172
It's exponentially longer
than it would take

217
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:25,675
if your ship was powered
using our dial energies.

218
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:28,303
But it's not.

219
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:30,722
That's real nice,
but we need a number.

220
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:34,434
Sorry. Only the wind
knows your answer.

221
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:35,977
Oh, of course! The wind!
The cloud...

222
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:38,646
Old man, you gotta know a
faster way to get us there

223
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,273
other than just sitting
here and waiting

224
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:41,775
for the wind to pick up.

225
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:43,276
[USOPP] See, Luffy!
It doesn't matter what we do!

226
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,070
You're always gonna find
a way to put me in danger!

227
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:46,196
I can't live like this!

228
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,280
[LUFFY]
What's your problem?

229
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:48,740
[USOPP]
I'm nervous.

230
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,084
[whistling]

231
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,265
Oh, no!

232
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:16,017
[HOLY THE DOG roars]

233
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:21,731
[HOLY THE DOG whines]

234
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:27,028
[gasps]

235
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,823
Bastard. He took my prey.

236
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:34,244
[NAMI]
Those voices. Those sounds.

237
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:36,538
What were they?

238
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:39,124
[laughing]

239
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:41,126
[SHURA]
Just give up!

240
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:42,711
[SATORI]
You should do the same.

241
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,838
This boy is mine! Ha-ha!

242
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:46,131
Not if I can help it!

243
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:49,217
[SATORI] Oh, but it doesn't
look like you can!

244
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:52,721
[SATORI laughs]

245
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:00,854
Wait. What the--?

246
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:02,605
Who are they?

247
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:04,816
Something tells me
I don't wanna find out.

248
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:06,526
What's going on?

249
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,877
[LUFFY]
Yeah!

250
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,504
Finally, we have someplace
dangerous to go!

251
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:27,922
I can't sit around on this beach

252
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,383
and wait for the wind
to pick up any longer!

253
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:33,094
Hey, Luffy! What's that
thing you're carrying?

254
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:36,014
[yelling]

255
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:38,600
Oh, no! That's not that
old broken waver, is it?

256
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:39,476
You'll kill yourself!

257
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,103
[LUFFY]
Here I come!

258
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:43,355
[BOTH scream]

259
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,568
[ZORO]
What an idiot.

260
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:50,153
[USOPP]
How could he possibly not know

261
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:51,029
that was going to happen?

262
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:54,074
[LUFFY]
Help me!

263
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:57,243
So, uh, does anyone
wanna save him?

264
00:13:57,327 --> 00:13:59,079
[ZORO, USOPP, SANJI]
Let him drown!

265
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:03,750
Man, you are such a
pain, you know that?

266
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:10,173
[PAGAYA] Hmm. So this is
your old waver, huh?

267
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:12,217
You should take
better care of it.

268
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,427
It's not ours. We found
it like that that.

269
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:16,429
[PAGAYA] Would you like me
to take a look at it?

270
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:19,474
Assuming it's fixable, I should
be able to do that for you.

271
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,518
How would you know
how to fix it?

272
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:24,187
I'm an engineer that
specializes in dial ships,

273
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,397
so I should know.

274
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,565
Yeah? Really? Then what
are you waitin' for?

275
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:28,942
Uh.

276
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:31,736
Get to work, old man!

277
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:37,742
[WYPER]
Eneru.

278
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:54,718
Leave this one to me.
He's my prey.

279
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:57,512
Oh. So you have the itch
to compete, do you?

280
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:00,724
Well, you'll be happy to know
that I would enjoy fighting you.

281
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:02,517
To kill my boredom!

282
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,977
[PURPLE VULTURE caws]

283
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,104
Heh. Very funny Shura.

284
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:07,731
We'll see how confident you are

285
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:10,191
after I feed you and your
ugly friend to my pet dog!

286
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:13,737
[SATORI]
Oh-ho! I sense a confrontation!

287
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,489
Too bad it's between
a couple of weaklings.

288
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:17,532
[laughs]

289
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:19,784
[GEDATZ]
Speak for yourself.

290
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:50,190
[gasps]

291
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:03,620
What the--?

292
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:09,292
You, down there, help!

293
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:11,670
Please, give me a ride! Please!

294
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:15,590
You want a ride? But this
is a one person boat.

295
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,966
Please help me!

296
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,677
I came here from
another sky island

297
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,221
in search of some
missing treasure!

298
00:16:21,304 --> 00:16:22,722
But I don't care
about that anymore!

299
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:25,308
I just wanna get
out of here! Please!

300
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:28,061
Oh, I can't. There's no room.

301
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:30,814
Either give me the boat
or I'll slice you up!

302
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:32,691
[screams]

303
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:34,192
[ZABO]
Guerilla!

304
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:44,703
[ZABO]
No.

305
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,174
[gasps]

306
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:03,346
[WYPER]
Is this Eneru's doing?

307
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:14,566
[WYPER]
How dare you harm Vearth!

308
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,247
[WYPER yells]

309
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,253
[NAMI screaming]

310
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,569
[OHM] Get some water
dials down here now!

311
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:01,446
The fire's spreading!

[MCKINLEY]
Form up. Salute!

[WHITE BERETS]
Heso!

314
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,043
Good day. Heso!

315
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:17,379
What are the White
Berets doing here?

316
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:19,756
Oh, no, something
must've happened.

317
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,258
You are all warned to
use extreme caution!

318
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:24,177
I've received word
that illegal entrants

319
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,807
have infiltrated Skypiea
through Angel Beach today.

320
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,476
There are reportedly
seven suspects!

321
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,727
But do not worry!

322
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,479
You can help with our
search and investigation

323
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:36,523
by reporting all
suspicious activity!

324
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:38,900
Leave it to the White Berets!

325
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,071
[WHITE BERETS]
White Berets!

326
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:44,489
[GEDATZ]
Did you see that?

327
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:47,242
It appeared as if he was talking
to someone in the water.

328
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:49,411
[SATORI]
He was probably delusional.

329
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:52,497
[SHURA] Would someone
please shut that dog up?

330
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,833
[SATORI] He was most likely
begging for his life.

331
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,209
[SATORI laughs]

332
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:58,753
[OHM] Why did Eneru take
care of that guy himself?

333
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,965
Isn't that why he sent us
here in the first place?

334
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:03,633
[GEDATZ]
We probably ran out of time.

335
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:06,094
[SATORI]
Ran out of time?

336
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:07,679
[GEDATZ] Yet another
group of illegal entrants

337
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:10,557
have already
infiltrated Skypiea.

338
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,933
[SHURA]
Again?

339
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,019
[GEDATZ] Old lady Amazon
informed us that it's a ship

340
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:16,771
with seven Blue Sea
dwellers on board.

341
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,107
[NAMI]
Seven Blue Sea dwellers?

342
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,109
That's probably us!

343
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:22,902
We're here illeagally?

344
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:24,904
But if you wish to proceed,

345
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:26,656
you must first pay
the entrance fee

346
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,950
of one billion
extols per person.

347
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,952
That is the law.

348
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:38,668
[NAMI] Because we didn't pay
the entrance fee? No way!

349
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:42,213
The people who were on
that abandoned boat...

350
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:46,301
And that guy I just saw.
Did he enter illegally, too?

351
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:47,677
Because if that's true,

352
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:49,721
I don't want that bright
flash of light coming for me

353
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:51,848
and frying me to death.

354
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:55,393
[SHURA] Seven Blue Sea dwellers
should be a cake walk for us.

355
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:56,895
[OHM]
Seven heads.

356
00:19:56,978 --> 00:20:00,023
Looks like one of us is
gonna have to share.

357
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:02,817
[NAMI] What the heck is
happening on this island?

358
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,612
And who are those people?

359
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:07,739
[NAMI]
This is crazy!

360
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:18,667
I need to get back to
the others to warn them.

361
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,544
I just hope I get to them
before it's too late.

362
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:30,178
[CHOPPER chuckling]

363
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,972
Beat this one, Usopp! Look!

364
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:34,516
[chuckles]

365
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:37,102
I don't think that'll
be a problem!

366
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:41,272
See? My cloud sculpture's so
good it should be in a museum!

367
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:42,190
[USOPP laughs]

368
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:44,067
[CHOPPER]
That's amazing!

369
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:48,238
That's the worst looking
art I've ever seen!

370
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:51,032
This is what I think of
your uninspired work!

371
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,659
Nami could be in
danger right now

372
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:54,828
and you're playing around
in the clouds like a child!

373
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,037
How dare you!

374
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,956
I hope your favorite
sculpting hand rots off!

375
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,833
[LUFFY]
So can you fix it?

376
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,419
[PAGAYA] I've never seen
parts like these before.

377
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:04,212
Come on, just fix it already!

378
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:05,880
[PAGAYA] I'm sorry,
but until I have a chance

379
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,550
to look at this closer,
I don't know if I can fix it.

380
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:09,843
Will you at least try?

381
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:11,469
[PAGAYA]
Yes, of course.

382
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:17,267
Huh?

383
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,102
Looks like we have company.

384
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:28,528
[MCKINLEY]
You there! On the beach!

385
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:29,821
Don't move!

386
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:32,449
Does he mean us?

387
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:47,088
[SANJI] Hey, uh...
why are they crawling?

388
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,173
[USOPP]
Who knows?

389
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:51,176
I mean, they've
obviously got issues.

390
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:54,846
[CHOPPER] Because they're
crawling around like crabs?

391
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:58,183
[MCKINLEY]
White berets, halt!

392
00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:01,644
[WHITE BERETS]
Heso!

393
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,562
[CONIS]
Heso.

394
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:03,563
[PAGAYA]
Heso, gentlemen.

395
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:05,190
[SUU]
Suu-suu.

396
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:07,984
Speak our language!
We can't understand you.

397
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:09,694
What are they? Soldiers?

398
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:11,738
Usopp said they have issues.

399
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:13,698
Well, look what we have here.

400
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,408
You must be the
Blue Sea dwellers

401
00:22:15,492 --> 00:22:18,286
who have illegally entered the
sovereign land of Skypiea!

402
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,579
[ALL]
Huh?

403
00:22:19,662 --> 00:22:21,498
Prepare to have the weight
of Heaven's Judgment

404
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:23,416
brought down upon you!

405
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:30,674
<i>Now, I look up and see,</i>
<i>there's something out there,</i>

406
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:34,302
<i>beyond the endless</i>
<i>clear-blue sky...</i>

407
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:38,014
<i>Possibilities,</i>
<i>of just what could be,</i>

408
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:45,146
<i>a "someday" I'll see if I try...</i>

409
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:01,663
<i>When I am alone</i>

410
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:07,502
<i>all of the memories go</i>
<i>racing through my mind...</i>

411
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:10,005
<i>The things that</i>
<i>I've said and done,</i>

412
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:14,801
<i>the ones I've lost,</i>
<i>the dreams I left behind...</i>

413
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:19,806
<i>Sometimes I felt like</i>
<i>I would defeat myself</i>

414
00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:22,267
<i>until I recalled...</i>

415
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,980
<i>That there was a warm place</i>
<i>I could always go</i>

416
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:30,734
<i>if I happened to fall...</i>

417
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:36,489
<i>With friends and family...</i>
<i>Who'd pick me up...</i>

418
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:44,622
[ZORO] How may different degrees
of crimes are we guilty of?

419
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:45,915
[CONIS] The ones that
should concern you

420
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:48,084
are fifth degree crimes,
because that's when

421
00:23:48,168 --> 00:23:50,378
you'll be banished to the
land of the drifting clouds.

422
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,838
[USOPP]
So what? Big deal.

423
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:54,007
[LUFFY] Sounds fun. I'll take
a free vacation any day.

424
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,301
[CONIS] But you'll die!
It's a death sentence!

425
00:23:56,384 --> 00:23:57,677
[NAMI, CHOPPER, USOPP]
Death sentence?

426
00:23:57,761 --> 00:23:59,387
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

427
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:03,266
"Already Criminals?!
Skypiea's Upholder of the Law!"

428
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,019
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!
