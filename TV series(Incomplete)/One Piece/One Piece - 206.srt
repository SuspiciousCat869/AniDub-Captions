00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,740
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

00:00:19,773 --> 00:00:21,309
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:23,848
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,585
Is that exciting or what?

<i>Back when we first started,
we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:54,743
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:56,814
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:00:56,847 --> 00:01:01,891
<i>For together we found we look
through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:07,301
<i>And we know, that our
hearts have brought us here.</i>

destiny,</i>

<i>No regrets!</i>

00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:36,192
<i>Every tear that we've cried only
helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:43,240
<i>You and those dreams
are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:50,788

Not my special pirate

28
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,509
[JONATHAN] They slipped off
your hook, eh, Major Shepherd?

29
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:19,212
[SHEPHERD]
I had them, blast it!

30
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:20,782
They got lucky, that's all!

31
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:23,788
Besides, you're the commander
of this two-bit fortress!

32
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:26,660
If they escape,
it's entirely your fault!

33
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,733
Entirely mine? 'Kay.

34
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:32,706
But be sure to mention how a
certain someone kept interfering

35

with my plans in
your report to HQ.

[growls]

37
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,818
These Straw Hat Pirates.

38
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:41,690
They're exactly the way
Admiral Akainu described them:

39
00:02:41,723 --> 00:02:43,326
Inventive and bold.

40
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:46,232
And as strange as that sounds,
I owe them my thanks.

41
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:49,338
They've proven that Navarone
is still an effective base.

42
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:51,710
Like a wily fish, they've taken
the bait, put up a fight,

43
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:53,781
and broken the line a few times.

44
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:55,919
Even the wiliest fish
can be hooked, though.

45
00:02:55,952 --> 00:02:58,490
It just takes patience.

46
00:02:58,524 --> 00:02:59,392
And with that on our side,

47
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:02,231
there's only one
place they'll end up.

48
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:02,866
Caught.

Are you just going to sit back
and let those pirates escape?

[JONATHAN] Don't worry, Major.
This game is about to end.

57
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,371
It's almost time for checkmate.

58

But--

59
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:25,477
The Straw Hat Pirates
are as good as caught.

60
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,951
In fact, the 9 PM net will
scoop them up pretty soon.

61
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:30,086
Net? What net?

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,993
And what's this "9 PM" business
you're talking about?

63
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:36,901
I can't tell you just yet.
It would ruin the surprise.

Guys! I can't wait to get
outta here, can you?!

Well, our navigator
doesn't feel the same way.

67
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:50,695
Nami's not so happy.

00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:52,899
[SANJI] You okay, Nami?
Somethin' wrong?

69
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,770
Crap, I sure don't like
the sound of that.

71
00:03:57,074 --> 00:04:01,382
Look! Marine warships!
And they're headed right for us!

72
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:10,333
Hey, wait! It looks
like they're stopping!

73
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:14,374
They dropped their anchors?

74
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:18,316
I guess they gave up.

75
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:19,485
It seems so.

76
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,491
Of course they did! They
must've come to their senses!

77
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:23,761
They'll never catch us!

78
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:27,034
[laughing]

79
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,673
Why aren't they firing
on us at least?

80
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:32,077
Oh, no. Have they
set another trap?

81
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,585
That's what's worrying me.
I don't know.

82
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:39,024
Man, Nami's even beautiful
when she's worried.

83
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:44,068
Commander. The time has
finally come, sir.

84
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:47,408
Right. Just maintain
your position.

85
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:49,580
Maintain? That's
Drake, isn't it?

86
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:52,384
Then order him to pursue
those pirates this instant!

87
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,090
They can't just drop anchor
and sit there like lumps!

88
00:04:55,123 --> 00:04:56,894
[JONATHAN] There's a reason
why they dropped anchor

89
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:59,666
where they did, Major.

90
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,837
The time is now 9 PM.

91
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,574
Yeah, so?

92
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:04,642
[JONATHAN] If they didn't
drop their anchors,

93
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:08,116
the fangs of Navarone's
waters would devour them.

94

[SHEPHERD]
What are you talking about?

95
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:14,930
What's that sound?

96
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:17,134
It sounds kinda like
a river flowing.

97
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,438
[LUFFY]
There's a river on this island?

98
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:22,879
I didn't notice it when
we were walkin' around.

99
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:25,818
[ROBIN]
This should shed some light.

101
00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:30,126

102
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,439
[USOPP]
The rudder isn't working!

103
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:39,880
The tide. It's rushing out
and taking all of the water.

104
00:05:39,913 --> 00:05:43,721
It's too late! We're trapped!

105
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:46,492
[SHEPHERD] Devoured by
the water's fangs, eh?

106
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:47,862
[JONATHAN] They could
have the best navigator

107
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:50,033
in the world onboard
and it wouldn't matter.

108
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,706
Anyone on a ship in that part
of the bay at this time of day

109
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,041
gets caught in the net.

110
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:55,812
Like I said, with
a little patience,

111
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:57,716
you can hook the wiliest fish.

113
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:04,061
[NAMI]
Yeah. I knew it!

114
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:06,834
Why are you patting
yourself on the back?

115
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,971
I knew there had to be
a reason why the Marines

116
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:11,644
would use a shallow bay
full of reefs as a port.

117
00:06:11,677 --> 00:06:14,015
I wondered that the first
time we tried to escape.

118
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:14,583
And?

119
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:16,720
Now I have the answer.

120
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:19,626
This is a shallow bay,
but they can let more water in

121
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,864
and regulate its depth
with the Sea Gate.

122
00:06:21,897 --> 00:06:23,199
However, they can also use it

123
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:25,838
to let water out at low
tide if they need to.

124
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:28,009
For instance,
to stop a fleeing ship.

125
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:31,115
Which makes trying to escape
at low tide impossible!

126
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:33,053
Oh, so that explains
why no ships

127
00:06:33,086 --> 00:06:35,992
can enter or leave the base
during certain times of the day.

128
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:36,693
Nice work.

129
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:40,535
I'll say! You're a genius, Nami!

130
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,471
So, what do we do?

131
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:44,643
Duh! We head for the Sea Gate!

132
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:46,212

Yes! A plug!

That's what we need--a plug--
or we're gonna sink!

there's no way we can sail!

And that means--

154

[ZORO] We can't sail
outta this place either.

right into their hands.

I'm really getting
sick of these traps.

No, we can't!

I got a plan!
Gimme some food first!

If you can't save your
captain from drowning,

168
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:06,205
you could at least
make him some dinner!

00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:17,595
we don't have to worry
about the ship sinking

175
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:19,331
until the next high tide.

176
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:21,770
That's true, but we
can't escape, either.

177
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:23,908
[LUFFY] Since we can't do
anything else, let's eat!

178
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:27,615
[NAMI] We've got more to worry
about than your stomach! Look!

179
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:35,864
It's them!

180
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:43,647
[JONATHAN]
Attention, Straw Hat Luffy

181
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,884
and his fellow crewmates!

182
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:49,324
[gasps]

183
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,401
I can't believe it!

184
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:57,274
Even those Straw Hats got
caught in the 9 PM net!

185
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:58,443
It's like they say.

186
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:01,115
No one can escape from the
fangs of Navarone's waters.

187
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:02,919
What's gonna happen
to that cook?

188
00:09:02,952 --> 00:09:06,192
Well, um, he'll probably
get what the Marines

189
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:09,832
give to all pirates:
A death sentence.

190
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,245
[KOBATO]
Uh! Dad!

191
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:18,149
You shouldn't be out
here in your condition!

192
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,051
You're still sick!

193
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:20,655
Hush up! I'm fine!

194
00:09:20,688 --> 00:09:22,992
Besides, I told you
I was feeling better.

195
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:24,629
For his sake,
that long nose fella

196
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:26,900
better not've ruined
that beautiful ship!

197
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,606
If he did, I'm gonna
go kick his butt!

198
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,609
Mr. Deer!

199
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,887
[JONATHAN] All of you
have fought valiantly

200
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,091
against one of the Marines'
greatest fortresses,

201
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:41,028
and for that, I salute you.

202
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:44,034
You may be the enemy, but
you've impressed me greatly.

203
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,272
However, it's time
we end this game.

204
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:48,142
This is checkmate.

205
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:50,180
You've got nowhere to run
and you're surrounded,

206
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:53,319
so don't even think
about trying to escape.

207
00:09:56,025 --> 00:10:00,032
You put up a good fight, but
accept it, you've been beat.

208
00:10:01,803 --> 00:10:03,674
Now, listen.

209
00:10:03,707 --> 00:10:05,711
Surrender, and as commander
of this fortress,

210
00:10:05,744 --> 00:10:07,247
you have my word that
you and your crew

211
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,886
will be treated with
the utmost respect.

212
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,391
Give up quietly and I'll
even make you a deal.

213
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:14,094
Luffy!

214
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,006
[JONATHAN] You and Roronoa Zoro
are the only Straw Hats

215
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,208
with bounties on your heads,

216
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:24,315
so I have no choice but to hand
you over to headquarters.

217
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:28,122
However, I promise to let the
rest of your crew go free.

218
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:33,099
But if you attempt another
escape, I'll get mad.

219
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,101
Take them!

220
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,673
In case you've forgotten,
I'm the commander.

221
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:40,313
You're a visiting inspector.
Be quiet and inspect.

222
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:41,516
[growls]

223
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:43,286
[SHEPHERD] At this rate, the
only thing I've accomplished

224
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:45,123
is to get in the way
of this old badger!

225
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:47,261
I came here to shut him
and his fortress down,

226
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:49,331
but if he catches
the Straw Hats...

227
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:52,103
Excuse me for a moment.

228
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:54,976
Heh.

229
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:13,278
[USOPP]
Hey, guys!

230
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:14,916
I think I've got the answer
to our predicament,

231
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:16,485
and it's right in my hand!

232
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,391
Ta-da! This Impact Dial!

233
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:20,861
While escaping
from the fortress,

234
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:22,431
I kept using it
to absorb impacts

235
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:24,234
when those troopers
tried to stop us!

236
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,403
There's so many inside,

237
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:27,775
I betcha we could blast the
Merry out of here with it.

238
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:28,242
Oh!

239
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:29,210
Super!

240
00:11:29,244 --> 00:11:30,748
And if it could just
get us over the cliffs,

241
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,150
then we could reach open water.

242
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:34,789
Yeah, but out of the frying
pan and into the fire.

243
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:36,827
With that big hole,
we'd sink right away.

244
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,431
What if we could make that
octopus balloon fly again?

245
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:41,035
Hey, that's a good idea!

246
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,039
[NAMI] Yeah, we could use
the Flame and Breath Dials

247
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:44,041
to re-inflate it!

248
00:11:44,074 --> 00:11:46,145
[CHOPPER] It would have
more hot air than Luffy!

249
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:48,449
[ALL laugh]

250
00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:49,853
[ALL groan]

251
00:11:49,886 --> 00:11:50,921
Too bad we lost it.

252
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:51,389
Uh-huh.

253
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:52,124
I'll say.

254
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:52,725
Where'd it go?

255
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,961
--The octopus?
--Yeah.

256
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:54,529
I have it.

257
00:11:54,562 --> 00:11:55,831
Luffy has it.

258
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:56,499
He does?

259
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:57,902
That's what he said.

260
00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:58,937
[SANJI]
Who has it?

261
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:59,873
[ROBIN]
Luffy.

262
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:01,342
He has it.

263
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,879
Yep! Sure do!

264
00:12:02,912 --> 00:12:05,517
[OTHERS]!
What?! Where?

265
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:10,192
Right here!

266
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,769
Do you mind telling us why
that thing's in your pants?!

267
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,074
He helped us out when
we fell from the sky,

268
00:12:17,107 --> 00:12:18,844
so I wanted to keep him safe.

269
00:12:18,877 --> 00:12:20,146
Wasn't that gross?

270
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:21,917
[SANJI]
For him or the octopus?

271
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,484
Gross how?

272
00:12:22,518 --> 00:12:24,121
[chuckles]

273
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:25,791
Now that he's back in fresh air,

274
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:27,528
we should inflate
the octopus again.

275
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:29,231
Heh. Right, Long Nose?

276
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:30,467
Um, sure.

277
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,538
Now if I could just
find my Flame Dial.

278
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:34,809
Somehow, it's gone missing.

279
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:37,414
I was playing with it in
the kitchen. It's spiffy.

280
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:38,584
[USOPP screams]

281
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:41,823
Stop it! Or I'll give you
a taste of this Impact Dial!

282
00:12:41,856 --> 00:12:44,294
Speaking of which,
who's gonna fire it?

283
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:49,004
[ALL chuckling]

284
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:50,473
What gives?

285
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:52,845
Who does that Impact
Dial belong to?

286
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:53,947
It's Usopp's.

287
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,915
Right, Long Nose?

288
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:57,421
Then it's only fair we
let the owner do it.

289
00:12:57,454 --> 00:12:59,058
You're the best, Usopp.

290
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:00,427
Good luck, Usopp!

291
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,897
[ZORO]
Hey, don't worry, ol' buddy.

292
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,332
We'll give ya a hand.

293
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,070
[LUFFY]
It's decided then!

294
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:08,943
[USOPP]
No!

295
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,417
Sergeant! Prepare to open fire!

296
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,121
Aye!

297
00:13:14,154 --> 00:13:16,124
Prepare to fire!

298
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,370
[MARINS] In position, sir!
Give the order!

299
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,353
Come, dear. A hard-working
man has to eat sometime.

300
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:32,324
See, I even made your favorite.

301
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:36,499
Including broccoli and carrots
and green peppers again, eh?

302
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:39,004
Thanks, but I still have
quite a lotta work to do.

303
00:13:39,037 --> 00:13:39,872
All that's left for you to do

304
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:41,910
is take those pirates
into custody.

305
00:13:41,943 --> 00:13:44,616
Besides, they're trapped, you've
got nothing to worry about.

306
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,485
They're not going
anywhere, dear.

307
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,256
[JONATHAN] I'd like to
believe that, but so far,

308
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:51,128
those Straw Hats have proven
to be full of surprises.

309
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:52,497
[JESSICA]
They're trapped until high tide.

310
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,168
How could they escape?

311
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,236
[JONATHAN]
Well, you're forgetting

312
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,474
where they originally
appeared from.

313
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:58,544
Huh?

314
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:02,016
That's right. The sky.

315
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:05,223
Hey, all set up here!

316
00:14:05,256 --> 00:14:06,626
Roger!

317
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:10,332
Everything's ready!
It's all up to you guys now!

318
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:13,473
No! I don't wanna do it!

319
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:16,245
Using this thing's gonna
hurt like crazy!

320
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:17,214
Three!

321
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:18,216
Two!

322
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:20,086
One!

323
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:21,354
[JONATHAN]
Hm?

324
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:26,933
[SHEPHERD] If anyone's going
to take you Straw Hats down,

325
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,504
it's going to be me!

326
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:30,373
Headquarters will
probably give me a medal

327
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:32,945
and a promotion for
crushing the lot of you.

328
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:34,615
[ALL]
And lift off!

329
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:41,562
[USOPP screams]

330
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:47,675
[JESSICA gasps]

331
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,912
They can fly!

332
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:56,325
[ALL gasping]

333
00:14:56,358 --> 00:14:58,029
[MECHAO]
I knew it!

334
00:14:58,062 --> 00:14:59,497
[BOTH gasp]

335
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,204
What the--?!

336
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:05,610
No, it's not possible!

337
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:09,552
[LUFFY] Hmm... I don't know
how to put this, but--

338
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:12,023
Robin! Hurry! Now!

339
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:14,061
Well, let's do it.

340
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:16,164
[ROBIN]
Cien Fleurs!

341
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:25,316
We're still falling!

342
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:27,087
Luffy! The Flame Dial!

343
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,524
Gotcha!

344
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:30,527
Inflate!

345
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:37,040
[CHOPPER]
Go higher!

346
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:39,546
Come on, Usopp. We need
you to do one more.

347
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:42,652
No, please. Not that.
Anything but that.

348
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:44,321
Tell ya what, do this
and I'll make you

349
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:47,728
something special for
dinner sometime, 'kay?

350
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:50,166
[USOPP]
But I won't be alive to eat it!

351
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,368
Come on!

352
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:53,339
Please fly, please
fly! Come on, fly!

353
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:55,511
We said fly, so do it now!

354
00:15:55,544 --> 00:15:57,447
You can do it! Come on!

355
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,148
[ZORO]
Ah, crap!

356
00:15:58,182 --> 00:15:59,519
[SANJI]
Water's flowing in!

357
00:15:59,552 --> 00:16:01,055
[USOPP screams]

358
00:16:01,088 --> 00:16:01,990
All right!

359
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:05,263
I guess Usopp will take
one for the team.

360
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:07,568
Support my shoulders
and arms again, 'kay?

361
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:08,436
You got it!

362
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:10,339
Attaboy.

363
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:15,483
Just gotta think of the Going
Merry's pain as my pain!

364
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,185
[SANJI]
Three!

365
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:16,753
Two!

366
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:17,487
One!

367
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:18,222
Now fly!

368
00:16:18,255 --> 00:16:18,657
Come on!

369
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,592
Please fly!

370
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:23,766
Yeah! Fly!

371
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:27,340
[ALL]
Impact!

372
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:35,156
[MARINE G]
Ah! A giant octopus!

373
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:36,793
Yeah! We did it!

374
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:38,697
[JONATHAN]
I told you not to try anything.

375
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,135
You leave me no choice then.

376
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:44,374
Sergeant, the minute they're
in range, you may open fire.

377
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:45,242
What?

378
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:47,347
But target the balloon,
not the ship.

379
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,085
I want them taken alive.

380
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,727
Easier said than done.

381
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,929
Fire a warning shot.

382
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:58,302
If they don't stop, aim the
second shot for the balloon.

383
00:16:58,335 --> 00:16:58,903
Understood?!

384
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:00,574
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

385
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:06,720
[yells]

386
00:17:06,753 --> 00:17:07,722
[SHEPHERD]
Oh, no.

387
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:11,261
I won't let you get away
that easy, Straw Hats!

388
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:13,900
[SERGEANT]
Steady.

389
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:17,039
Remember, the first one's
just a warning shot.

390
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:20,780
[SHEPHERD]
Say goodbye!

391
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:34,407
[screaming]

392
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:42,824
Should'a known. He interfered.
He just can't resist.

393
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,766
[LUFFY, CHOPPER chuckle]

394
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:09,846
[SHINPACHI]
The cook. He's gone.

395
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:12,384
They can really fly. Amazing.

396
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:13,620
[MECHAO chuckles]

397
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:18,162
Now do you finally believe me?
They did fall from the sky!

398
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:20,634
[LUFFY] Whoa! Would ya look
at the size of that place?

399
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,838
[CHOPPER] I thought it
looked big on the inside!

400
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:25,711
Well, so long,
old Fortress Guy!

401
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:27,782
Adieu, Jessica!

402
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,852
[USOPP] Um, guys, not to
complain or anything,

403
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:31,656
but why aren't they
shooting at us?

404
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:34,829
[ROBIN] That base was designed
to repel an attack by sea.

405
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:37,367
Its cannons can't
target this high.

406
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,603
[JESSICA]
Lost your catch?

407
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:39,303
[JONATHAN chuckles]

408
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:41,341
They're "the one that got away."

409
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:43,179
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

410
00:18:43,212 --> 00:18:45,584
[JONATHAN]
Oh, Sergeant. Your men okay?

411
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:46,886
Yes, we are, sir.

412
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,289
The cannon was destroyed,

413
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:51,228
but luckily, we suffered
no injuries.

414
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:52,665
That's good. Carry on.

415
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,902
[DRAKE] Commander!
We can still catch them!

416
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:56,873
Give the order and we'll pursue!

417
00:18:56,906 --> 00:18:59,177
[JONATHAN] They're beyond our
cannons' reach now Drake.

418
00:18:59,210 --> 00:18:59,912
Let 'em go.

419
00:18:59,945 --> 00:19:00,880
But--!

420
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:03,854
The men in your unit,
you performed well.

421
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:05,758
I'm proud of you all.

422
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,527
Thank you.

423
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:12,337
Shepherd. Thanks to you,
the Straw Hats escaped.

424
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,874
Don't blame this on me!

425
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:17,280
You're the commanding officer!
They escaped on your watch!

426
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:18,884
Just wait'll I contact HQ!

427
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:23,492
Heads will roll...
and roll... and roll!

428
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:26,331
I don't care if you are one
of Admiral Akainu's favorites!

429
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:27,902
You have my word!

430
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:31,776
That I will recommend this
fortress be shut down for good!

431
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,345
Plus, I'll recommend
that everyone

432
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:35,851
who serves here be
dishonorably discharged!

433
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:36,351
Eh?

434
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:38,456
[JESSICA chuckles]

435
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:40,459
I don't think so!

436
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:48,309
I hate to agree, but...

437
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:50,379
...they did get away from you.

438
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:51,616
[JONATHAN]
True, but they got away

439
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,385
because of his interference.

440
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:54,922
It doesn't matter, though.

441
00:19:54,955 --> 00:19:58,362
We still managed to achieve
our primary objective.

442
00:19:58,395 --> 00:19:59,765
Huh?

443
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:06,513
Haven't you noticed that
everyone here on the base

444
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:07,982
has been working together?

445
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:09,484
[gasps]

446
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:17,433
You're right. I hadn't
thought of that before.

447
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,703
That was my goal.

448
00:20:18,736 --> 00:20:20,841
It just took those Straw
Hat Pirates appearing

449
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:22,978
to help achieve it.

450
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,283
Oh, sure, I've heard
what the brass at HQ

451
00:20:25,316 --> 00:20:26,786
say about this place.

452
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:29,525
That it's "too big" and "hasn't
seen any action in awhile"

453
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:31,596
to justify its existence.

454
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:32,965
But that's not important.

455
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,602
What is, is that we soldiers

456
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:36,739
and you support staff
worked as a team.

457
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:38,309
Together, we proved
that Navarone

458
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:40,814
is still a force to
be reckoned with.

459
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:45,056
The truth of it is the Straw
Hats are notorious pirates,

460
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:46,726
and we endured.

461
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,830
Since we were able to
repel the likes of them,

462
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:51,536
there's no way HQ
will shut us down now.

463
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:53,507
That assures that you
and everyone else here

464
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,878
still has a job.

465
00:20:55,911 --> 00:20:57,848
You proud of me?

466
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,054
Of course.

467
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:02,457
But what about him?

468
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,060
I slugged him pretty
hard, ya know.

469
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:05,898
Do you think he'll put
that in his report, too?

470
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,739
Who cares? I was about
to slug the bastard myself.

471
00:21:09,772 --> 00:21:14,047
[JONATHAN, JESSICA laugh]

472
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,853
[JONATHAN] Well, Straw Hat,
where will you go next?

473
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:18,322
There are people at headquarters

474
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:20,928
who've expressed a
deep interest in you.

475
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:23,432
Wherever you go, I have a
feeling that the road ahead

476
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:25,904
won't be an easy one.

477
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:28,710
This sure is nice.
Wonder how far we'll fly.

478
00:21:28,743 --> 00:21:29,912
Well, Zoro?

479
00:21:29,945 --> 00:21:31,583
Who knows? Ask the balloon.

480
00:21:31,616 --> 00:21:32,551
Yeah.

481
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:34,755
Then we should sit back
and enjoy the ride.

482
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:35,790
Leave it to fate.

483
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:38,028
I just hope that it's not
another Marine base.

484
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:40,867
I'll go anywhere if Nami
and Robin are there!

485
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,036
I'm in paradise!

486
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:42,604
[ZORO]
Moron.

487
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:43,405
[SANJI]
What's that?

488
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:44,675
[ZORO]
You heard me! Bring it on!

489
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:48,015
[USOPP] While you guys beat each
other up, I'll patch the hull.

490
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:51,990
Hey! Hold on, I never
got any dinner!

491
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:56,832
Sanji! Food! I'm starving!

492
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:12,698
<i>A future lies before us
waiting to begin</i>

493
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,837
<i>Let's take to the wind!</i>

494
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,979
<i>and search the world for answers</i>

495
00:22:20,012 --> 00:22:24,522
<i>to all the questions
in our minds</i>

00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:28,863
<i>Exploring day and night we'll...</i>

497
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:33,907
<i>...live out our
dreams in paradise!</i>

498
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,613
<i>And that's why...</i>

499
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,719
<i>We're running,
and running,</i>

500
00:22:39,752 --> 00:22:42,691
<i>traveling along
an open road</i>

501
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:45,931
<i>Never letting go of
what we came to do</i>

502
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,536
<i>We're here to see this through!</i>

503
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:51,542
<i>We can't lose, can't lose,</i>

504
00:22:51,575 --> 00:22:54,515
<i>nothing on earth
can stop us now</i>

505
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:57,855

00:22:57,888 --> 00:23:03,899
<i>We Dream and live
our lives free!</i>

507
00:23:14,988 --> 00:23:17,160
[LUFFY]
That fortress sure was fun!

508
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:19,464
[NAMI] But where are we
gonna land this time?

509
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:20,901
I'm really worried.

510
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:22,103
[ROBIN]
I saw an island ahead.

511
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,573
[CHOPPER]
Why didn't you say so?!

512
00:23:23,606 --> 00:23:24,909
[USOPP]
How unattractive.

513
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:26,044
[ROBIN]
Are you referring to me?

514
00:23:26,077 --> 00:23:27,146
[USOPP]
No! Sorry!

515
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,150
[SANJI] You're always
attractive! It's the island!

516
00:23:29,183 --> 00:23:31,923
[ZORO] What's with this place?
And what's that?

517
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:33,860
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

518
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:36,532
"Great Adventure at
Long Ring Long Land!"

519
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:39,136
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
