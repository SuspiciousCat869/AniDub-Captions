00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.505
â™ª Opening Song

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.131
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:41.034
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:46.239
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.775
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:52.045
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:53.880
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:56.282
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.319
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:03.623
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.258
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:08.995
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:13.266
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:18.004
[NARRATOR] At long last, the
Straw Hat Pirates have reached

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:21.274
the waters of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.143
Their first stop is Punk Hazard,

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:26.579
an island divided into
freezing and burning halves.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.915
There, they soon discover
the twisted motives

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:32.952
behind the ruler of the island,
the mad scientist Caesar Clown.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:36.189
Teaming up with the Warlord Law
and Vice Admiral Smoker,

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:39.259
they launched an assault
on Caesar's lab.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:42.829
Now, with Caesar defeated,
they make their escape.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.668
[panting]

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.972
[cackles]

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:57.177
Smoker! Your heart
is still in my hands.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.113
And I'm not going to hell alone!

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.650
[DOFLAMINGO]
Monet.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.286
I'm surprised you're alive.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.621
Vergo's been defeated.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:12.425
[DOFLAMINGO]
I feel sorry for you all.

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:15.628
I misjudged the whole situation.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.164
[DOFLAMINGO]
No more games.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.501
I want them all wiped out
in one fell swoop.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.703
Deep in the third lab,
you'll find the weapon

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:27.207
responsible for destroying
the first two laboratories

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.744
as well as the rest of the
island exactly four years ago.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:33.913
With the simple
push of a button,

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:38.384
Punk Hazard's population will
be reduced to a single person.

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:42.422
The only one who can survive
the Land of the Dead,

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:45.425
our dear friend, Caesar.

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:46.759
The location of the device--

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:49.862
You don't need to say
another word, Joker.

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:54.400
[MONET]
I was going to do it anyway.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.669
[DOFLAMINGO]
Very good.

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:58.972
Die for me, Monet.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.574
And take everything with you.

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:06.145
[MONET]
Understood.

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:13.186
[LUFFY] "A Critical Situation!
Punk Hazard Explodes!"

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:51.691
[LUFFY laughs]
So fast!

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:00.600
[BROOK] What is wrong
with you? Get off him!

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:03.503
[MOMONOSUKE]
I refuse to do so!

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:06.873
You are really heavy!
You're gonna break him!

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:09.108
Why is there a dragon
here with us?

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.544
Momo? I met him
at a garbage dump.

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:13.279
[NAMI]
Wow, what?

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:17.583
[MOMONOSUKE]
It is clearly his visage!

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.559
[MOMONOSUKE]
Father!

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:28.995
This eel is quite
distraught. Huh?

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:30.897
Please save my father!

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.234
[BROOK screams]
It's gone mad!

00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:40.306
Momo! What's wrong?

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:44.177
Did he just call out "father"?

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.279
How does that
biologically add up?

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:48.181
[LAW]
Worry about it later.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.985
[LAW]
I don't see any light ahead.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.856
There's still some distance
before we reach the exit.

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.393
How hard did Straw Hat
punch Caesar exactly?

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:28.054
[cackles] Sure hope
you're good at math,

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:30.056
because your days are numbered!

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.959
Smoker!

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:09.028
[MONET]
Straw Hat Luffy and his crew.

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:13.766
[MONET]
Trafalgar Law.

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:19.272
[MONET]
G-5.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.447
[MONET]
And even those poor children.

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:34.654
[MONET]
Every one of you.

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:37.323
This is where you will die.

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:39.525
Here with me.

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:47.400
[MONET]
Farewell, Young Master.

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:51.170
[MONET] Though I won't
be around to see it,

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:53.139
I know you'll become...

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:55.741
...the King of the Pirates.

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:49.395
[MONET gasping]

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:14.086
[DOFLAMINGO] Hm? Why is the
snail still receiving a signal?

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.856
The island should
be gone by now.

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:41.213
[ALL yelling]

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.182
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:44.750
Hey, are you okay?

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:45.718
[GIRL B]
Mm-hmm.

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:46.619
[CHOPPER gasps]

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:48.754
[gasps] I don't know
what happened,

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:49.956
but that sounded pretty bad.

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:52.592
Must've come from Building D.

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:54.193
Trust me, I know.

00:09:54.226 --> 00:09:57.063
That's the SAD
Manufacturing Room.

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:07.974
[DOFLAMINGO]
Monet.

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:23.623
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles]

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:26.892
Adios, Smoker! See you in hell!

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:31.230
[CAESAR CLOWN cackling]

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:37.269
[heart beating]

00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:48.848
What happened? Monet?

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.522
I'm sorry...

00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:58.491
My Young Master...

00:10:58.524 --> 00:11:04.530
[heart beating]

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:11.737
[beating stops]

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:21.981
[SMOKER]
Hey. Law.

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:31.157
If we get off
this island alive,

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.693
you and I'll go our
own separate ways.

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:35.194
But there's somethin'
I've gotta ask you

00:11:35.227 --> 00:11:37.930
while I still have the chance.

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:39.632
[LAW]
And that is?

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:55.781
Here, this belongs to you.

00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:04.156
[SMOKER gasps]

00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:07.293
[SMOKER] I was under the
impression that my heart

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:09.929
was in Caesar's possession.

00:12:09.962 --> 00:12:14.100
So how the hell did you end up
getting your hands on it?

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:17.269
Simply put, he got
mixed up on the details.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:21.507
I hold onto your
heart for safekeeping.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.776
What do you say, do we
have ourselves a deal?

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:27.346
[cackles]

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:31.751
[LAW] At first, Caesar wasn't
willing to trust me.

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:34.920
He requested that I
hand over my heart to him.

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:37.256
And in exchange,

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:40.826
he let me hold onto his
secretary, Monet's heart.

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:45.364
We have ourselves a deal.
Shall we shake on it?

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:49.368
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles]

00:12:49.401 --> 00:12:50.870
[LAW]
And as you know,

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:54.640
I sliced out your heart when
you first arrived at the lab.

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:10.990
[LAW] So our little encounter
put me in possession

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:12.892
of two hearts.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:31.277
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles]

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.979
[CAESAR CLOWN] The heart
of the leader of the G-5.

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:36.982
Vice Admiral Smoker.

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:41.153
What a wonderful
souvenir. Thanks.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.190
[LAW]
He just made that assumption

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:46.225
and I didn't bother
correcting him,

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:49.461
but I gave him back Monet's
heart out of kindness.

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:05.211
I need a response.

00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:08.380
Answer me.

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:14.820
[LAW]
As the old saying goes,

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:18.357
when you do something
nice for other people...

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.527
...well, that good karma's
bound to come back to you.

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:21.987
[BABY 5]
Pretty hot, huh?

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:27.693
This Missile Girl's...
burning passion!

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:31.964
[BUFFALO]
Hey, hey, Baby 5!

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.867
[BUFFALO] You still wanna
hold onto this weapon?

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.569
I mean, ya can already turn
into every weapon ya want.

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.406
[BABY 5] Thanks for grabbing it,
Buffalo, that was sweet.

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:43.575
That weapon's imbued with
magic powers, you know!

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:48.814
Whoever owns this weapon
is bound to lead a happy life.

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:51.951
And if ya buy it from me, you'll
make me a happy man, too!

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:54.420
What? Really?

00:15:55.387 --> 00:15:59.458
[BABY 5] I'm the only one
who can make him happy!

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:01.860
That was just a scam, obviously!

00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:04.229
Oh, crap, look out
behind you, Baby!

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:05.431
[BABY 5 gasps]

00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:11.370
[FRANKY]
I dunno who you creeps are,

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:13.505
but I'll tell ya who
you're dealin' with.

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:18.911
I am the one and only
invincible Iron Pirate! Woo!

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:23.215
I don't fight for peace on
the sea 'cuz that ain't for me!

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:25.617
Oh, Iron Pirate!

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.152
[BABY 5]
I'm done with this.

00:16:27.186 --> 00:16:31.090
Weapon-morphosis! Revolver Girl!

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:35.828
[FRANKY]
Ha! That tickles!

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:39.131
[BABY 5 groans]

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:42.401
[FRANKY] Huh. I take it
you didn't like my song.

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:44.269
Damn, this guy's tough as nails.

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:46.205
[BUFFALO]
Baby 5!

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:47.439
Bombs away!

00:16:47.473 --> 00:16:50.109
Thanks, Buffalo! You're a pal!

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:53.545
This oughta do the
job. Deflect this!

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:55.981
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:17:09.628 --> 00:17:14.066
Aw, crap! This tunnel's
gonna collapse any second!

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:14.833
[BOY A]
Huh?

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.068
[ALL gasp]

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:17.569
[LUFFY]
I got it!

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:23.876
The ceiling's
completely giving out!

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:27.780
This tunnel is burrowed
directly through the mountain.

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:29.281
If it caves in, we'll be buried.

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:31.483
[USOPP] You gonna do
something about it or what?

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:34.319
[MARINES gasp]

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:35.687
[SUBORDINATE A screams]

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:41.794
Dammit! The passage is blocked!

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:43.028
Hit the brakes!

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:44.396
[MARINES gasp]

00:17:48.967 --> 00:17:50.202
[ZORO]
Don't slow down.

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:51.770
[MARINE C]
What?

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:22.901
[MARINES gasp, cheer]

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.536
Awesome!

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.172
Holy crap! He saved us!

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:31.543
I don't want that guy
as my enemy! Even if he is!

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:32.911
[BROOK chuckles]

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:35.347
[LUFFY laughs]

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:41.887
You might not wanna get
comfortable just yet.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.122
[CHOPPER screams]

00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:44.790

Huh?

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:58.437
[CHOPPER]
The poison gas!

Can't we catch a break?

00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:09.281
I'm so sick of
runnin' from this crap.

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.782
It's gotta be seepin' in through

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.918
all the giant
cracks in the walls.

00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:15.921
So if the falling rubble doesn't
kill us, then the gas will.

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:19.791
Could you stop being morbid for
just once in your life, please?

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.735
[LAW] There's bound to be
a gas cloud blocking the exit.

00:19:29.768 --> 00:19:30.802
[SUBORDINATE C gasps]

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:33.739
Anyone on board capable of
conjuring up some wind?

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:35.207
[OTHERS]
What?

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.243
You expect someone to just
coincidentally have that power?

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:40.112
[NAMI]
Oh. Right here.

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:41.513
I can do that.

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:43.582
[OTHERS]
Seriously?

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:54.826
[gasps] I can see
the end of the tunnel!

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.828
[ALL]
Huh?

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:59.665
Nice! Just a little more to go!

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:01.466
Move faster!

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:39.972
Young Master!

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:42.274
Young Master?

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:50.449
[SUGAR]
Young Master?

00:20:50.482 --> 00:20:53.018
Young Master!

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.422
[SUGAR]
What's the deal?

00:20:57.456 --> 00:21:00.192
Where are you?

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:06.164
[SUGAR]
I can't find the Young Master.

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:10.035
[LAO G] He should be in
his room on the fourth floor.

00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:12.738
But he's not. I looked up there.

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:15.040
The window was open.

00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:18.777
[LAO G]
Ah. Well, then.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.747
I don't know where he is.

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:25.350
[LAO G sighs]

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:30.789
Sounds like he headed
off on his own again.

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:36.528
[DOFLAMINGO] It's me. Tell me
what's happening over there.

00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:39.631
[BUFFALO]
Uh, actually, we got some kinda

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:42.601
metal security guard
giving us trouble.

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:45.737
[DOFLAMINGO]
But other than that,

00:21:45.771 --> 00:21:47.272
the two of you are still safe?

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:48.507
[BUFFALO]
Uh, yes, sir.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.142
[DOFLAMINGO]
So the island and everyone on it

00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:53.378
hasn't gone up in
a massive explosion.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.585
[DOFLAMINGO]
All right, it's settled.

00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:04.156
For now, I want you two
to take care of that guard.

00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:08.794
I'll be there shortly.

00:22:16.401 --> 00:22:19.304
[NARRATOR] As Doflamingo
stealthily draws near,

00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:22.708
the battle over custody of the
wanted Caesar Clown heats up.

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:24.843
And when General
Franky's armor is pierced

00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:26.445
by the fangs of Baby 5,

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:29.715
the invincible metal warrior
uses his ultimate secret weapon

00:22:29.748 --> 00:22:31.817
to launch a massive
counterattack!

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.852
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:33.885 --> 00:22:37.756
"Capture Caesar!
General Cannon Blasts!"

00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:40.792
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
