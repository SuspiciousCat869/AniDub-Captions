[bicycle bell ringing]

00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,290
[MARINE A] He doesn't seem
to be here, Vice Admiral!

4
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,459
[VICE ADMIRAL] I know
that already, you imbecile!

5
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,461
I'm asking you where
the hell he went!

6
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,096
Since his bicycle
is missing too,

7
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,066
he probably went to sea.

8
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,235
[VICE ADMIRAL A] Contact
the Five Elder Stars!

00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,402
[MARINE A]
Sir!

10
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,073
[AOKIJI]
Pardon me. Coming through.

11
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,315
We should expect this
sort of thing by now.

12
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,252
He's likely just
sight-seeing again.

13
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:32,786
[FIVE ELDER STAR B]
Be that as it may,

14
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,688
don't you think he should
show a bit more respect

15
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,889
for his position?

16
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:40,361
We can't have him wandering
about whenever he sees fit.

17
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,462
[FIVE ELDER STAR B]
Admiral Aokiji is one of

18
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,098
Navy Headquarters' ultimate
powerhouses, after all.

19
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,373
Can't say I'm surprised
to see a bounty

20
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,540
on this kid's head.

21
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,543
His whole family's
full of troublemakers.

22
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,048
"Proud Man! Silver Fox Foxy!"

23
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,622
Hey Captain,
stop fooling around

24
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,792
and lend me a hand for a sec!

25
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:15,229
[LUFFY] Whoa! Now that's
what I call a tidal wave!

26
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:19,133
Ooh, scary!

27
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,200
[ROBIN]
Looks like he's having fun.

28
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,368
[NAMI]
Tell me about it.

29
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,506
I bet he'll be laughing even
if the ship gets capsized.

30
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,507
Forget that--we need to worry

31
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,176
about the mast snapping
before anything else.

32
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,511
[CHOPPER]
It can really break?!

33
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,513
Then what's gonna
happen to us?!

34
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,114
Don't get so worked up.

35
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,783
Even if the mast
does end up breaking,

36
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,718
that still doesn't
mean the ship'll sink.

37
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,787
And we've got a
navigator, don't we?

38
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,557
She's smart and cute enough
to get us out of any storm.

39
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,629
[PORCHE]
We need to worry about the mast

40
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,264
snapping before anything else!

41
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,398
[HAMBURG]
It can really break?!

42
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,602
Then what's gonna happen to us?!

43
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,370
Don't get so worked up!

44
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,205
Even if the mast
does end up breaking,

45
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,341
that still doesn't
mean the ship'll sink!

46
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,242
[SANJI]
Huh?

47
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:04,678
Hey! How's it going?
Long time no see!

48
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,714
Oh wow, look,
it's Staw Hat!

49
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,315
[PORCHE and HAMBURG]
Hey! Hey!

50
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,284
I won't stand
for this, Straw Hat!

51
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,318
Don't even look at us!

52
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,554
We haven't sunken so
low that we'd beg for help

53
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,724
from one of our sworn enemies!

54
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,492
Okay! See ya!

55
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,427
Wait! But if you
want to help us,

56
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,029
we're okay with
that, you know!

57
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,533
Hey, Boss, behind you!

58
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,475
Nothing to be afraid of!
Slow-Slow Beam!

59
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,181
Beam!

60
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,086
We're gonna die!!!

61
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,559
Whoa, that wave
looks pretty bad.

62
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,296
A tiny boat like that won't
stand a chance in this weather!

63
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,097
Hold on! I got it!

64
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,570
Here! Grab this!

65
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:05,606
No! I meant grab the rope,
not my arm, you dummy!

66
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,007
Luffy!

67
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,506
Well, this is all
that's left of me.

68
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,675
My crew is gone,
the Sexy Foxy is gone,

69
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,612
and now I don't even
have a ship to sail with.

70
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,747
This is the end
of the Silver Fox.

71
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,049
I might as well face the music.

72
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:49,883
I'm a fool.

73
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,084
It would've been
better for everyone

74
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:54,622
if I'd just let myself sink
to the bottom of the ocean!

75
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,323
Boss, no!

76
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,560
So you think he's
faking it, or what?

77
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,363
In my expert opinion,
I'd say yes.

78
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,064
Take pity on me-- at this point,

79
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,400
I have nowhere to go
and no one else to turn to!

80
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,702
Let me stay on your ship.
I'm begging you.

81
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,237
Sure, why not?

82
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:10,904
You don't have your own,

83
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,073
and you gotta go somewhere.

84
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,541
Here, have a little soup.

85
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,776
We wouldn't want
you catching a cold.

86
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,378
Wow! That looks great!

87
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:20,447
I think I'll share
some with Choppy!

88
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,082
Hey Sanji, me too!

89
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,350
This is all I have left.

90
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,252
[SANJI] I'll cook you
some more tomorrow.

91
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,158
[SANJI] Something wrong?
You can help yourself.

92
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,192
What are you trying to pull?

93
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,529
It's not really soup
if there's nothing in it.

94
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,164
How 'bout I put
you in the soup?

95
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:40,334
Would you like that?!
Huh?! You ingrate!

96
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,203
[USOPP] Foxy! Apologize
before he murders you! Quick!

97
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,237
[LUFFY]
What?!

98
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,109
[PORCHE] Oh my gosh!
Look at all this stuff!

99
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,345
They've got gold and
jewels and everything!

100
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:54,381
Why didn't anybody tell me
the Straw Hats were so rich?!

101
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,517
Oh shoot, the
soup's getting cold!

102
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,452
Choppy! Where are you?

103
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,593
[PORCHE]
Choppy!

104
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,364
Phooey. Guess it was
just a candleholder.

105
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,142
[yawns]

106
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,178
[yawns]

107
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:27,013
[yawns]

108
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,517
Huh? Where's Boss?

109
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,219
[CHOPPER]
AAAAAAHHH!

110
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,521
[PORCHE]
Come back, Choppy!

111
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,724
They don't honestly
expect me to fish, do they?

112
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,792
That's not how
you treat a guest!

113
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,527
Besides, if I want
something to eat,

114
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,762
I can just grab one
of these oranges.

115
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,165
[sounds of fighting]

116
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,700
[LUFFY]
Shoulda figured.

117
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:50,103
[HAMBURG]
Puh-puh-puh!

118
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,410
It can't be!

119
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,046
Boss! I see the Sexy Foxy!!

120
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,747
Wait, what?!

121
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,049
[HAMBURG]
Ahoy! Ahoy!

122
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,051
[USOPP] Does that mean
you're getting off our ship?

123
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,319
[THREE FOXY PIRATES]
Ahoy!

124
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,755
[SANJI] Did someone
say they're leaving?!

125
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,657
[STRAW HAT PIRATES]
Over here! Over here!

126
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:19,466
[CHOPPER]
Sodium.

127
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,137
[ROBIN]
Hydrogen phosphate.

128
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,438
She still looking for me?

129
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,107
No, they all went
back to their old ship.

130
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,108
[sighs]

131
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:31,478
[sobbing]

132
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,582
You guys, even after
we were separated

133
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,585
you still couldn't forget
about your old boss!

134
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,620
Oh, I see, I see.

135
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:42,122
Well, you can all come
back to the Foxy Pirates now,

136
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,457
so there's no need to cry!

137
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,827
[loud sobs]

138
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,529
C'mon, it's okay!

139
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,097
Now that everyone's
together again,

140
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,166
it'll be just like old times!

141
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,667
I hate to break it to you Foxy,

142
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,002
but I'm afraid
that's not possible!

143
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,439
Says who?

144
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,641
Don't make me
throw you off my ship!

145
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,642
[FORMER CAPTAIN]
Your ship?

146
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:05,145
This ship belongs to the
Fang-Frog Pirates now!

147
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:09,717
In other words, these men
are my underlings, not yours.

148
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,119
[gasps]

149
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,189
[ZORO] Huh?
Fang-Frog? Who are they?

150
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,690
[NAMI] Oh!
They're those pirates we ran

151
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,492
into who lost half
of their crew to Foxy

152
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,227
in a Davy Back Fight.

153
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,261
But this time,

154
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,264
Foxy's the one who
lost all his stuff to them.

155
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,666
Wow, that must
suck for Split-Head.

156
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:26,633
[ZORO] That's what he
gets for winning all

157
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:30,804
of his crew members
from some stupid game.

158
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,307
I'll pass on the tearful
farewell, thank you.

159
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,376
C'mon, let's go.
We're done here.

160
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,311
Not so fast.

161
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:40,180
We still have some
business to settle.

162
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,349
Y'see, some of these
new recruits of mine

163
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,119
are still a bit too attached
to their former boss.

164
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:45,786
That is to say,

165
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,221
I can't get them to take off

166
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,455
those ridiculous-looking masks

167
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:51,758
and frankly it's turning
into quite an eyesore.

168
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,129
A captain has to earn
the respect of his crew,

169
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,197
you know,
it doesn't come free.

170
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,432
Whoa is it just me,

171
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,668
or is Foxy kinda
cool all of a sudden?

172
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,703
He's okay. For a Split-Head.

173
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,038
[FORMER CAPTAIN]
Respect you say?

174
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,172
Well, in the world of pirates,

175
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:08,342
the weak do tend to flock
to the strong, don't they?

176
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,611
In that case, if I want
them to come to their senses,

177
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:14,081
all I have to do is defeat
their old boss in a fight.

178
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,685
I challenge you,
Silver Fox, Foxy!

179
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,421
You want to fight
me again, do you?

180
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,656
I'll beat you as many
times as it takes.

181
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,492
[CROWD murmurs]

182
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,561
[USOPP]
Uh-oh! He's gonna accept!

183
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,564
Hey! Come over here
and check this out, quick!

184
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,433
Split Head's on fire over there!

185
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,701
He's on fire?

186
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,569
That sounds dangerous.

187
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,104
I'm not sure.

188
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,406
Have a little more faith
in your captain, Porche.

189
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,075
You should be happy.

190
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,209
We'll have our old ship

191
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:45,045
and our old crew
back in no time!

192
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,749
Now, why don't
we make it official?

193
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,317
As Captain of the Foxy Pirates,

194
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,520
I challenge you Fang-Frogs
to a "Davy Back Fight!"

195
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:54,487
Watch and learn!

196
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,390
I'll show you what a
real captain is made of!

197
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,810
Feh-feh-feh!

198
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,146
You wanted to prove that
you were stronger than me?

199
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,116
Then why don't we start this
game off with a little duel.

200
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,319
Strictly between us
captains, of course.

201
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,755
I trust you have
no objection to that.

202
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,590
He's pretty confident, isn't he?

203
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,558
With his powers, I would be too.

204
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,093
So you think
he's gonna use 'em?

205
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,062
Well yeah, what
else would he do?

206
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,765
Here I come! Slow-Slow Beam!

207
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:44,704
Noooooo...

208
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,009
Now's your chance,
men! Take him out!

209
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:53,681
Hahahahaha!

210
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:54,815
You're not much of a threat once

211
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:57,751
that annoying little beam
of yours is taken care of!

212
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,354
Not so funny when it
happens to you, huh!

213
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,454
Hold on, Boss!

214
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,757
What do you think you're doing?!

215
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,458
Hold it right there!

216
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,394
[FORMER CAPTAIN]
Drop your weapon!

217
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:20,440
Cuuuuurse yooooou!

218
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:34,088
Hahahaha!

219
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,557
There! What do you think
of your old boss now?

220
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,658
Pretty pathetic, huh?

221
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:41,562
Only a fool would stay
loyal to a captain like him!

222
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,097
What's wrong with you?!

223
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,465
This was supposed to be a duel,

224
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,601
between captains,
you big cheater!

225
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,536
You don't know anything, kid!

226
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,373
It's true that Foxy
challenged me to a duel

227
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:54,742
but I never said I accepted!

228
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,610
That jerk's askin' for it.

229
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,078
Calm down, Luffy.

230
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,314
It's up to Foxy to win
this fight on his own.

231
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,749
Butting in won't do
anyone any good.

232
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:08,288
[FOXY] Feh-feh-feh...
The swordsman is right.

233
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:13,327
Just sit back and
watch, Straw Hat.

234
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,394
I'll put my pride on the line,

235
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:17,564
and show you what the
Silver Fox can really do!

236
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,300
Whoa! Check out
that thing up there!

237
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,539
Hey! The fox guy's gone!

238
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,207
Did anyone see where he went?!

239
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,242
He went that way!

240
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,110
Trust me, I would
never ever lie!

241
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,446
Great! Thanks!

242
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,414
You think we'd
fall for that?!

243
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:38,686
I wonder if they're
having a party

244
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,387
or something without me.

245
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,289
Maybe I should go up
there and check it out.

246
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,158
Oh? I thought you
wanted to stay

247
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,259
and play games with me.

248
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,294
But if you'd rather have
that girl chase you around,

249
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,295
that's fine, too.

250
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,799
Ah!

251
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,667
'Kay, it's your turn, Robin.

252
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,338
[ROBIN chuckles]

253
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:58,672
[groans]

254
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,474
Hahahaha!

255
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,643
[FANG-FROG B] There you go,
one roasted fox coming up!

256
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,616
No! AAAH!

257
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,721
Stop right there.

258
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:16,656
I'll teach you who's the captain
around here if it kills you!

259
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,301
[FOXY] Hey, I thought
you were only supposed

260
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:31,505
to use weapons on your enemies.

261
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,439
Doesn't make much sense

262
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,476
to turn them on your
men, if you ask me.

263
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,177
Oh?

264
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,046
If you think you
can rule with violence

265
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,614
and fear alone
then you're nothing

266
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:44,051
but a bully bossing
around a bunch of thugs.

267
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,619
It takes a hell of
a lot more than that

268
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,521
to be the captain of a ship.

269
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,224
You're better off
just giving up now.

270
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:53,159
Give up on my ship
and crew, too!

271
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,730
'Cause as long as I'm here.

272
00:14:56,763 --> 00:15:00,100
I'll fight for them with
all the power I've got!

273
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,469
Shut your mouth!

274
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,376
Boss, no!

275
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,780
[LUFFY]
Hey, Split-Head!

276
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:15,215
Hang in there!
It's not over yet!

277
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,120
Come on.

278
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:26,594
Oh, It's you, Straw Hat.

279
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:29,163
I guess that was pretty
pathetic, wasn't it?

280
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,365
Feh-feh-feh...

281
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:38,138
But say would you do me
a favor, just this once?

282
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,406
Here...

283
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:44,178
I want you to have this.

284
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:48,148
That match of
ours even if I lost,

285
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,250
it was the best time of my life.

286
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:01,262
[SANJI]
No, It can't be.

287
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,197
Leave everything to me.

288
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,799
I'm gonna get your
groove back, fox man.

289
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:11,772
I'm your opponent now!

290
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,141
But I'll warn you,
Fang-Frog Pirates

291
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,143
this afro don't take prisoners!

292
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,544
So funky!

293
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,779
[FORMER CAPTAIN]
Now hold on a second,

294
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,514
this has nothing to do with you.

295
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:21,348
[LUFFY]
It does now!

296
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:22,182
[FORMER CAPTAIN]
Well that's too bad,

297
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,150
because I don't
want to fight a guy

298
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:26,453
with a 100-million-berry
bounty on his head.

299
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,656
I got too much to lose
and nothing to gain.

300
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,557
Feh-feh-feh!!

301
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,526
How stupid can you be?

302
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,695
If you win, that
bounty will be yours

303
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,797
and that's in addition
to the 60 million berries

304
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,666
you'll get for his swordsman!

305
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,501
Now let me share
a secret with you.

306
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,269
I've been on Straw Hat's ship.

307
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:46,407
And he's got a whole mountain
of gold tucked away in there.

308
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,576
Needless to say, I'm sure
that's worth quite a bit.

309
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:53,547
You're pirates, aren't you?
Then grab that booty!

310
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,583
[Feh-feh-feh!]

311
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:58,252
That's what we get for
letting them stay on our ship!

312
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,821
Why's he bragging?
It's not his treasure.

313
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,624
I'd better check later to
make sure nothing is missing.

314
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,459
[FANG-FROG C]
Did he say mountain of gold?

315
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:06,560
[FANG-FROG B]
He sure did.

316
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,262
Prepare the cannon men!

317
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:10,130
We're taking out Straw Hat!

318
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:15,035
Yeah!

319
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,603
[FORMER CAPTAIN]
Fire!

320
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,448
That looks like fun!

321
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:28,782
Yeah!

322
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:32,486
Go on, I know you want to-- Ah!

323
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,620
What was that?!

324
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,322
Huh?

325
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:38,659
Heh heh heh!
Hand over the gold nice an--

326
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,227
[ZORO] Looks like
we'll have to take out

327
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,063
the whole crew, huh?
What a pain...

328
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:50,738
Ha! You think you can beat
all 500 of us? Get 'em, men!

329
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:53,040
What? We can't hear you!

330
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,074
Hey!

331
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,209
Well, that's too bad,

332
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,377
I guess it's just
you and me, huh.

333
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:59,446
Check out that thing up there!

334
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,647
Huh?

335
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:02,349
Hey! You tricked me!

336
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,151
[CROWD cheers]

337
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,152
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

338
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,821
So, Fang-Frog, how do
you like that Afro Soul?

339
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:11,091
Is it too wild?
You can't handle it?

340
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,459
How does it feel
to go head-to-head

341
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,361
with the only pirate in
the world strong enough

342
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:15,529
to defeat me?

343
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:18,064
Feh-feh-feh!

344
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,702
Go easy on these losers.
We don't want to kill them.

345
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:24,504
Not everyone has
superhuman strength, you know.

346
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,075
[thinking]
Sword...

347
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,276

woulda gotten a spear

to the face if I hadn't!

So are you gonna let me
beat this guy up, or not?!

No way! Put him down
and go apologize to Nami!
