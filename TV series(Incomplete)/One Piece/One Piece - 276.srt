1
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:03,470
Hey, is it true?

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,172
We've got a Navy ship
on the island?

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:05,839
What?

4
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,241
I haven't heard about that!

5
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,143
Yeah, it must've
anchored here over night.

6
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,711
Why would the Navy come here?

7
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:11,478
I know.

8
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,646
We're pretty remote.

9
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,481
Weird thing is, when people
went to look at the boat,

10
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,584
they didn't see
any marines there.

11
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,085
Wow, that is weird.

12
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,353
It was like a ghost ship.

13
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,288
Not a single person to be found.

14
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,557
C'mon, now you're
just fooling with us.

15
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,758
Professor!

16
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,426
Professor Clover!

17
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,430
Hm?

18
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,532
My goodness,
did something happen?

19
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:34,368
I hope it's nothing to worry
about, but I just heard that

20
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,737
there's a huge navy ship
anchored at the seashore.

21
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,771
We should take precautions.

22
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,373
It might be an investigation.

23
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,777
Better let the
other scholars know.

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,282
The raft is done!

25
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:49,716
All right!

26
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,657
So you're leaving already?

27
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,525
Now what's with that face?

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,695
You put those puppy dog
eyes away, little missy!

29
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,265
Actually.

30
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,734
I s'pose my raft
could use a flag, huh?

31
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:10,003
Guess I'll just have to
stay a little bit longer!

32
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:17,678
I'll be darned.

33
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,614
So you're looking to
set out to sea, too, huh?

34
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,182
Mm-hm.

35
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,218
My mom's been away
from home for years

36
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,720
thanks to all her big
archeological research.

37
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,523
But whenever she finally
comes back to the island,

38
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,726
I'm gonna ask her to take
me along on her next trip.

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,162
That's why I've been
studying so hard.

40
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,631
I got my archaeology
doctorate just like her.

41
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,400
You got a doctorate?

42
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,735
A tiny little girlie like you?

43
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,236
Mm-hm!

44
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,105
But hold on a sec.

45
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,107
Didn't you tell me you
don't even remember

46
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,143
what your mom's face looks like?

47
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:52,212
Yeah, but she's still my mom.

48
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,447
I wanna see her.

49
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,452
Hey, Saul.

50
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,386
Huh?

51
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,155
Did you know that
our world has a period

52
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,691
of 100 years that nobody
knows anything about?

53
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:04,925
Uh-huh.

54
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,062
I believe folks call that the
"Blank Century" don't they?

55
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,296
I'm curious about it myself,

56
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,733
but the government says it's
illegal for anyone to look into.

57
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,034
That's right.

58
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,302
But I heard my mom
is traveling

59
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,305
all over the world
investigating it in secret.

60
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:22,142
But don't tell anyone, I don't
want her to get in trouble.

61
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,310
What?

62
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,512
Are you telling me that your
mom's going around looking

63
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:29,316
for them ancient stone tablet
things they call Poneglyphs?

64
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,318
You've heard about Poneglyphs?

65
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,420
Yeah, but that ain't
the point here, okay?

66
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,621
You can't go
around talking about

67
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,058
this kinda stuff in front of
other folks outta the blue!

68
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,127
And if yer mamma's out
there looking for them,

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,462
you especially gotta be--

70
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:44,298
Huh?

71
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,299
Is something wrong?

72
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:49,637
Robin, do you happen to
know your mother's name?

73
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,641
It's Olvia. Nico Olvia.

74
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,651
You okay?

75
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:07,755
Robin is Olvia's daughter!

76
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:12,793
Wait, so does that mean--I've
been on Ohara all this time?

77
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:13,794
Mm-hm.

78
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:17,498
That's terrible! Oh no!

79
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:22,169
Why did I end up in
Ohara of all places?

80
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,705
This is no time to be
sitting around, Saul! Robin!

81
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,040
Yes?

82
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,007
This may come as a shock,

83
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,276
but you gotta listen
to me and listen good!

84
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,813
Navy battleships are on
their way to Ohara right now.

85
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,615
They may even be here already!

86
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,617
The Navy? Why?

87
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,053
They're gonna wipe out every
last scholar on the island!

88
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,557
That can't be. No.

89
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,260
So listen, whatever you do.

90
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,494
You're lying.

91
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,430
You can't let those government
guys know you're a scholar.

92
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:50,130
You're lying!

93
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:51,632
You gotta promise me that, okay?

94
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,200
Stop lying to me!

95
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,702
It's true, I swear--

96
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,204
I wouldn't joke about
something this serious!

97
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,606
Get to town as quick as you can

98
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,641
and see if anything
strange is going on.

99
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:04,344
I know it sounds crazy, but
your mom might be there, too!

100
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,509
It's been a while, hasn't it?

101
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,377
It's Olvia.

102
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,511
You came back.

103
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,713
We'd heard news that you'd
been captured by the Navy!

104
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,649
Don't tell me you
came back on their ship!

105
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,459
I hate to have to tell
you this as soon I return,

106
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,561
but the news you heard is true.

107
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,330
It's not your fault--we
knew the government

108
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,632
would set its sights
on Ohara eventually.

109
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,734
I'm not sure how much you know,

110
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,404
but the Poneglyph search
team that set off six years ago

111
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,573
was annihilated by the Marines.

112
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,608
33 researchers were killed.

113
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:51,078
I was the-- the only survivor.

114
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,247
Fortunately,
I was only captured,

115
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,816
but I overheard the Marines
talking after they had rummaged

116
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,618
through the search
team's belongings.

117
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:01,354
They soon realized that
we all came from Ohara.

118
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,657
I won't make any excuses,

119
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,261
all of you are in danger
because of my carelessness.

120
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:10,164
Stop it! Thinking like
that won't do any good!

121
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,799
Those who set out to sea

122
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:15,236
and those who stayed behind
are all part of the same team!

123
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,572
After what happened, if anyone
should apologize, it's us.

124
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,708
We know how much
you've suffered.

125
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,144
Professor.

126
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,412
For years now,

127
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,582
the World Government has seen
Ohara as a threat to their rule.

128
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,619
But all we can do is believe
in the truth of history,

129
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,321
and its value to
all generations to come.

130
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,322
Be that as it may,

131
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,591
they've put us in quite
a compromising position.

132
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,127
I just don't know how we're
going to get out of this one.

133
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,162
I admit, it doesn't look good,

134
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,198
but we're fortunate to have
discovered this information

135
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,132
when we did.

136
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,700
We know that the
government is hunting down

137
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,402
all the scholars on the island.

138
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,471
So before they
make it to the library,

139
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,640
we have to escape from Ohara!

140
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,108
You have a point.

141
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,410
This time, I have a
feeling we won't be able

142
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,580
to slip past their investigation
like we have before.

143
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,348
And if they're
committed to killing us,

144
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,484
they won't listen
to reason, either.

145
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:05,252
Then hurry up and run!

146
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,654
I'm sorry, Olvia.

147
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,123
I can't let myself
escape and leave

148
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,692
one of mankind's
greatest treasures behind.

149
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,193
You should know that.

150
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,362
Everyone else here
feels the same way.

151
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,263
Yeah.

152
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,065
Are you sure?

153
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,066
We still don't know what

154
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,734
the government's gonna
do when they get here.

155
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,169
But we do know, if we run,

156
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,572
we can't protect all
this precious knowledge.

157
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,640
We're not planning
on dying here.

158
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,775
Don't worry.

159
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,443
More importantly.

160
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:33,280
I know you have something
else weighing on your mind.

161
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:33,847
I can't.

162
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,383
It's too late for that.

163
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,252
Make up your mind, Olvia!

164
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,521
Are you going to
board this ship or not?

165
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:41,722
If you want to stay
with your daughter,

166
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,792
we'll settle your husband's
unfinished business for you.

167
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,795
No, I'm not turning back.

168
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,830
I'm a scholar of Ohara.

169
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,765
It's my duty to
carry out the will

170
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,768
of those who came before me!

171
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,403
Forgive me Robin.

172
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,505
I swear I'll solve
these mysteries

173
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,774
and come back to you some day.

174
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,414
Where's my mommy?

175
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,050
Where'd she go?

176
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,119
Your mom had to go
out to sea for her job.

177
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,322
You'll be staying here with
us for a little while, okay?

178
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,189
That's enough!

179
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,324
If you don't shut up,
I'll hit you!

180
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,426
Honey stop it, she's only two!

181
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,362
And so is our daughter!

182
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,363
Listen, I don't care

183
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,331
if she's your sister's child,
she's a burden!

184
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,399
This was a mistake!

185
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,607
Who's there?
What're you doing here?

186
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:39,145
Uh, I was--I--I mean, I just--

187
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,316
I'm so sorry!

188
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,720
If you want to read a book,

189
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,789
all you have to
do is ask, all right?

190
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,759
But I can't, 'cause
I don't have any money.

191
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,627
Well, then looks
like you're in luck,

192
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,330
because you can read
everything here for free.

193
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:57,531
For free?

194
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:00,601
Uh-huh! After all, this library
is the best in the world!

195
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:01,568
Is it really?

196
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,271
It sure is! Let's see,
unless I'm mistaken,

197
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,739
you're Olvia's daughter.

198
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,708
You like to read books?

199
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:14,381
She looks just like you did
when you were that age.

200
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:18,252
And I'm proud to say she's
every bit as clever, too.

201
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,488
If she's safe, that's enough.

202
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:25,392
When I decided to join you,
I severed all bonds with her.

203
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,795
I can't let her become
the daughter of a criminal.

204
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:30,731
Bad news!

205
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,200
Another ship came with
the World Government's flag!

206
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,069
One of their high-ranked
officials coming

207
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,637
all the way here
to the West Blue?

208
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:42,242
My goodness. It seems this
is quite serious indeed!

209
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,545
All right everyone, listen.

210
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:45,679
From now on,

211
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:48,515
you and I are neither
colleagues nor acquaintances.

212
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,620
You have to stick to
that no matter what.

213
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:53,587
Farewell!

214
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:57,124
Olvia, wait! What are
you're going to do?

215
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,294
All right,
tell HQ we've arrived.

216
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,463
Let's move it!
I wanna get this over with!

217
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,166
What a pain.

218
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,504
They better give me a promotion
when this crap is over.

219
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,706
Hey! I want you to
hunt down every scholar

220
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,608
on the island and restrain them.

221
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,076
Yes sir!

222
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,010
What's going on?

223
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,312
Some woman is running
around with a gun!

224
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:43,137
This is an awful mess!
I'm sorry, Robin!

225
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,171
Vice Admiral Kuzan!

226
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,773
Huh? What is it?

227
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,309
We've been informed
that CP9's Chief, Spandine,

228
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:50,044
has arrived in Ohara.

229
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,245
So what?

230
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,583
Did you really have to wake
me up just to tell me that?

231
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:57,284
I'm sorry, sir!

232
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,275
What's the matter, Robin?

233
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,676
You have to tell me.

234
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,346
Did my mom come by here?

235
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,513
Now hold on a minute.

236
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,048
Where did that come from?

237
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,017
Why would you think your
mother was back in Ohara?

238
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,753
I've severed all bonds.

239
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,854
No matter what,

240
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,757
I can't let her become
the daughter of a criminal.

241
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,227
I wish she was here,
too, but she's not.

242
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,796
Oh yeah! We're in trouble!

243
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,431
I heard there are
Navy battleships coming

244
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,599
to the island right now!

245
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,202
They're trying to get rid of
all the scholars on Ohara!

246
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:51,605
The people in town must
be stirring up bad rumors.

247
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,740
Huh?

248
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,742
The truth is,
that's no battleship

249
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,077
and they won't be
"getting rid of anyone".

250
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,546
The Government is
paying us a visit, though.

251
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,814
And that means
the library will be

252
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,584
under an investigation,
a harsh one.

253
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:04,651
So listen up.

254
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:07,187
No matter what those
government agents say or do,

255
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,722
you absolutely
cannot let them know

256
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,392
that you're an archaeologist
like the rest of us.

257
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,794
Since you're so young,
as long as you keep quiet,

258
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,429
no one will think
you're a scholar.

259
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,631
You understand?

260
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:21,235
Move it!

261
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,169
Stop what you're doing!

262
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,738
Put your hands in
the air and go outside!

263
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,674
Don't you think you're
being a bit violent?

264
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:29,743
The researchers here at the Tree
of Knowledge are being charged

265
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,446
with the heinous crime
of deciphering Poneglyphs.

266
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,614
We'll be investigating
the library,

267
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,550
so everyone get out of our
way and leave the building!

268
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,752
You'd better treat
this place with care.

269
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:42,089
The value of this collection is
well beyond your imagination,

270
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,023
I assure you.

271
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,292
I don't have to listen
to a word you say!

272
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:45,759
Take 'em outside!

273
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,661
Yes sir!

274
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,430
Attention, citizens of Ohara.

275
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,699
I regret to inform you that
the scholars of this island

276
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:55,269
may be devils in disguise,
plotting to destroy the world!

277
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,103
What?

278
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,237
But why?

279
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:59,173
Our scholars are the pride of
every person in Ohara-

280
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,442
they would never dream of
doing something like that!

281
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:03,210
From this point forward,
we will be conducting

282
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,546
a large-scale search
of the entire island!

283
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,681
During that time,
all those who are not related

284
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,251
to the research center must
take a form of identification

285
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:13,454
and head to the evacuation
ship on the west seashore.

286
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:14,521
Evacuation?

287
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:15,488
That's ridiculous!

288
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,625
Even if the scholars
did do something wrong,

289
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:19,593
that still has
nothing to do with us!

290
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,662
You can't kick us
off our own island!

291
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,265
Our only obligation was to
pass on this message to you.

292
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:27,334
Disregard our
warning if you like,

293
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,203
but we won't be held responsible

294
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:33,039
should any unfortunate
"accidents" occur.

295
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:39,480
You heard him!

296
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:41,649
Everyone, head
to the west shore!

297
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:43,483
I don't want to have
any part of this mess!

298
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:48,589
I've been shot!

299
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:50,157
This is it for me!

300
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,558
I'm a goner, damn it!

301
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,794
A goner! Contact the higher ups.

302
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:56,530
Tell them I want my
son to take over for me!

303
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,399
Calm down Chief--just
take a look.

304
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,634
The bullet went through
your sleeve, that's all.

305
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,435
Oh. I see.

306
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,707
I'll aim to kill next time.

307
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,376
Well, if it isn't Nico Olvia!

308
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,279
I find it hard to believe that
a devious criminal like you

309
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,715
would end up on this island
completely by coincidence

310
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,383
after your daring escape!

311
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,517
In other words,

312
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:19,386
despite the fact that
you've denied your connection

313
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,356
to the scholars of Ohara, you've
shown up at their doorstep

314
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,459
just in time to warn them
of our little investigation.

315
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,094
Now in my humble opinion,

316
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,364
that very clearly labels
them as your partners in crime.

317
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,266
You've no idea why I'm here.

318
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,235
That doesn't prove
one single thing.

319
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,503
Hmph.

320
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:38,339
I'm sure you've cooked up plenty
of excuses to cover for them.

321
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,608
You're a clever
woman, after all.

322
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:42,276
But that doesn't really matter,

323
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,711
because we don't have
to prove your connection

324
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:46,213
to the Ohara scholars anymore.

325
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,414
Now that we're here,

326
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,250
we can search every
little nook and cranny.

327
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,784
I doubt it'll take long
before we find evidence

328
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,254
of their Poneglyph research.

329
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,289
The government's
quite confident in this

330
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,358
and you know
they're never wrong.

331
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,827
This has been in the
works for a long time.

332
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,396
Capturing you after
6 years of hide and seek

333
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,199
was nothing more
than the final push.

334
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:08,235
There are plenty of Poneglyph
researchers around the world

335
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,436
and each time we captured one,

336
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:13,240
we tried to find any connection
they might have to Ohara.

337
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,575
Can you guess why that is?

338
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,612
Don't tell me, you're
making an example of us?

339
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,080
Exactly!

340
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:23,083
If we crush this
"holy ground of archaeology",

341
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,486
the entire academic
world will take notice.

342
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,421
It's the perfect opportunity
to show the world

343
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:31,225
exactly what happens to those
who research the Blank Century.

344
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:33,661
Then, the battleships
from headquarters

345
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,729
waiting on standby are here to--

346
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,464
Well look at that!

347
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,767
You are a clever
woman, aren't you?

348
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,968
Yes, as you might guess,

349
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:45,105
they're to ensure that not
even a single criminal escapes.

350
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,740
However, as a matter of form,

351
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,742
we still need to
verify their guilt.

352
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,145
We aren't pirates, after all.

353
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,446
So, I came all this way

354
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,381
to conduct a
compulsory investigation

355
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,818
of the island and chase off
anyone who's not involved.

356
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,220
It's curtains for you
and your friends.

357
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,022
There's no escape.

358
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,025
Take her down.

359
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,204
Hey, what're you doing?

360
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,273
All the books here
are world treasures!

361
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:21,141
Take him outside
and shut him up!

362
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,076
Move it!

363
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,177
You bastards!

364
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,279
They must have a secret room
somewhere around here!

365
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:27,347
Don't stop until you find it!

366
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:34,121
This is worse than I thought!

367
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:38,158
The battleships are here already
and there's a whole mess of 'em!

368
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,729
That should be everyone!

369
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:43,763
Good! Now don't
let them go anywhere!

370
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,334
Look! They're rounding
up all the scholars!

371
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,568
What did they do wrong?

372
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:51,372
They say they were cooking up
a plan to destroy the world!

373
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:52,506
That can't be true!

374
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,808
Where is the evacuation ship?

375
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,810
It's on the west
seashore! Hurry!

376
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,345
Everyone run!

377
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,713
Who knows what might happen!

378
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:03,217
Robin. They said there's
an evacuation ship waiting.

379
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,385
We don't know
what the government

380
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:05,686
is going to do anymore,

381
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,621
you should get
out while you can.

382
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:08,722
No way!

383
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,425
There's nothing but mean
people on that stupid boat!

384
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,327
I'm staying here
with my friends!

385
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,194
Robin.

386
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:14,795
I'm the same as you--

387
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:17,731
That's enough, just go!

388
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:22,136
Looks like you have the
situation under control!

389
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:23,571
Thank you very much, chief!

390
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,573
I was quite surprised.

391
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,174
Nobody warned me there were

392
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,210
such ferocious beasts
wandering the island!

393
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:38,418
But it makes for
a fine trophy, huh?

394
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,555
Olvia.

395
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,624
All right, listen carefully.

396
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:45,659
This woman is
an escaped prisoner.

397
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,728
We executed her
comrades after we found out

398
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:50,397
that they'd been
deciphering ancient texts.

399
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,334
But we still have a couple
of matters left to clear up.

400
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,336
So let me be frank here.

401
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:57,571
If she's your partner,
just come out with it already,

402
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,307
so I can get this
over with and go home.

403
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,378
How awful of them to
hurt someone like that.

404
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:08,382
Robin, for the
last time, go! Hurry!

405
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,483
Robin?

406
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:16,590
Robin!

407
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:22,262
My little girl.

408
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,601
You've grown so much!

409
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:34,375
Olvia.

410
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:35,643
Wh-what are they doing?

411
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,345
If they're not careful, they're
gonna burn the whole tree down!

412
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,748
I never thought they would
take such drastic measures!

413
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,651
Wow, they aren't
holding back, are they?

414
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,120
Puru-puru-puru... Click.

415
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:48,088
Hello? Is this the Chief?

416
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,490
Yeah. It's me.

417
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,225
We found a hidden
room in the basement!

418
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:54,061
They have a huge tablet there,
probably a Poneglyph,

419
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:55,763
and a massive collection
of research documents

420
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:57,665
discussing the ancient texts!

421
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,533
Nice work!

422
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,167
Click.

423
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,306
Well, scholars of Ohara,

424
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:09,610
I'm afraid your death sentence
has already been decided!

425
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:13,647
It's a pity. I hate to
lose so many fine scholars,

426
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,683
but you're really
forcing my hand, here!

427
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,290
Wow, what a letdown.

428
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,626
I came all this way
just to say that?

429
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:28,762
Guess we'd better report
to the Five Elder Stars.

430
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,598
Roger.

431
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:33,233
Professor, they aren't
really going to kill you?

432
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,401
They wouldn't do that

433
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,637
to someone just for learning
about history, would they?

434
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,371
Stupid brat!

435
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:38,639
What do you know?

436
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,741
They may say they're "learning
about history", but the truth is

437
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:43,077
they're learning how to
revive an ancient weapon

438
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,678
so they can commit mass murder!

439
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:45,545
You're wrong!

440
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,648
They would never
do anything like that!

441
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,183
Don't bother, Robin.

442
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:50,484
It's pointless to
discuss the matter

443
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,219
with an errand boy like him.

444
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,086
What's that?

445
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,722
Is it really the
ancient weapon itself

446
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,157
that the World Government
is afraid of?

447
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,591
Professor!

448
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:58,291
Be careful!

449
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,094
They're on the line now, Chief.

450
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:01,362
Good.

451
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:02,096
Hold on!

452
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:02,897
Huh?

453
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,698
Before you put
all of us to death

454
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:07,468
allow me to speak to
the Five Elder Stars.

455
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:09,203
Although we still
have much to learn,

456
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:12,306
we have proudly continued
our research for many years.

457
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:15,075
So at the very least, I would
like to share our hypothesis

458
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,811
on the Blank Century
with the world's leaders.

459
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:20,547
Stubborn old fart. Hey!

460
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,414
Yes sir?

461
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,651
I'm begging you,
please get out of here.

462
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:26,786
If you hear what I have to say,
you'll become a criminal.

463
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,590
Professor.

464
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:30,791
Hey, it looks like they found

465
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:32,459
the people from
the library guilty!

466
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:33,794
You gotta be kidding me!

467
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:34,828
Bad news!

468
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,430
There's a bunch of
Navy battleships closing in

469
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,765
on the island from the east!

470
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,400
This is about to get real ugly!

471
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:41,434
We'd better evacuate now!

472
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:43,404
What is that?

473
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:45,305
It's a giant!

474
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:50,577
Where are you, Robin?

475
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:54,114
You gotta get off this
island before it's too late!

476
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,763
Saul, please take care of Robin.

477
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:18,465
You have to help her
escape, no matter what!

478
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:19,500
What about you, Mom?

479
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:20,734
Aren't you coming with me?

480
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,169
I'm afraid there's still

481
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:24,171
something that
I have to do here.

482
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:25,806
No! I don't want to lose you!

483
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,208
I want to stay
together from now on!

484
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,209
Please!

485
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:32,813
On the next One Piece:
"The Tragedy of Ohara!

486
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,782
The Terror of the Buster Call."

487
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:37,050
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
