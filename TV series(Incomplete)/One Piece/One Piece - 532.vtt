WEBVTT

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.105
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.141
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.213
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.448
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.418
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.653
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.723
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.559
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.758
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece,

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:41.761
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:46.966
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.469
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:52.739
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets that they held.

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:54.707
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.010
this has proven to
be the end of road.

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:59.512
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:04.350
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:05.952
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.722
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:13.893
[LUFFY] I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.131
[NARRATOR]
Two years have passed

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:20.934
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:23.469
Reuniting after their
special training,

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:26.806
Luffy and his crew continue
on to the New World.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.709
The first stop on their
journey is Fishman Island,

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:32.745
thousands of feet
below sea level.

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.048
However, shortly upon arrival,

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.217
they found the
New Fishman Pirates

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.186
disturbing the peace
of the Ryugu Kingdom.

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.893
[yells]

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:49.629
[SHIRAHOSHI]
What a horrid thing to do!

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.069
[SHIRAHOSHI] Who are you, sir,
and what are you doing here?

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:58.104
Please don't hurt me!

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.476
Whoa. That's one big lady.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.745
Uh, I mean, big fish lady.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.320
[sobs] Someone help me!
Father, please! Brother, please!

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:17.290
Hey, wait! I didn't come
here to kill ya, okay?

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:23.830
[sobbing]

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:27.333
Ah! You suck, lady! Shut up!

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.605
[LUFFY]
"A Coward and a Crybaby!

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.408
The Princess in the
Hard Shell Tower!"

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:42.715
[WADATSUMI grunts]

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:46.119
[WADATSUMI]
Hey! Stay lit! Dimwit!

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:49.622
How many times have I gotta
tell ya that we're working here?

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:52.358
Wait to eat on your
own time, ya got it?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.295
Ooh, yummy!

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:59.032
[DECKEN]
Wadatsumi!

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:04.070
[DECKEN] Is there anything
you're neglecting to tell me?

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:07.774
Have you received a reply
from Princess Shirahoshi yet?

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:10.443
No. Sorry, Captain Decken.

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.078
There's still no word.

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:16.115
[DECKEN sighs] Just how long
has she kept me waiting?

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.018
[WADATSUMI]
Uh... About ten years or so.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:21.087
She's really taking her time.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.489
[DECKEN]
I don't blame her.

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:26.893
This is the doing of
that despicable Neptune.

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:31.397
He intends to force the Princess
into a political marriage!

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:33.800
Or so I suspect!

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.568
Ten years now!

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:38.071
That heartless monarch has
kept his daughter locked

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:40.940
in a steel tower
for an entire decade!

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:43.943
Oh, how it pains me so!

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.112
This cruel tragedy!

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:48.881
The Princess and I are in love!

00:05:48.915 --> 00:05:50.249
Ha!

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:53.386
So, I suspect!

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.490
Princess Shirahoshi!
You are my love!

00:05:57.523 --> 00:06:04.130
I love you! I love you!
I love you! I love you!

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:07.667
No matter how far I search
along this vast seafloor,

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.538
I will never find another as big
and beautiful as you, my dear!

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:14.374
We are meant to be together.

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:18.544
Yes! And so, I'll twist
the head off fate itself

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:21.414
to prevent you from
being with anyone else.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.850
I'd rather see you dead.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:27.854
Your choice. [cackles]

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:32.291
You can live as my wife,
or stop living altogether.

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:34.927
Let me give you another
token of my love.

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:37.063
An axe with a rose on it.

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:41.467
Accept this emblem of
my deadly, undying love!

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.140
Captain? Isn't that
the wrong direction?

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:48.674
Don't be a fool!

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:51.010
You know I never miss my target!

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.046
Just watch.

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:56.616
[FLYING PIRATE 532AA]
It reversed course!

00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:00.286
And look, it's heading straight
towards the Ryugu Palace!

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.523
[laughs]

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:09.595
[sobbing, screaming]

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:12.565
Hey, whoa! Will ya calm down?!

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:16.169
I'm just a hungry pirate
lookin' for somethin' t'eat!

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:17.403
Jeez, listen to me!

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.172
[sobbing]

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:24.944
Hey! She's so loud! My ears!

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:27.079
[GUARD 532AA]
Princess Shirahoshi's crying!

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.514
[GUARD 532BB]
Get to the Hard Shell Tower!

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:30.650
[GUARD 532CC] Fine, but where
the hell are the on-duty guards?

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:33.753
What?! So there's
nobody protecting her?

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:34.854
[GUARD 532A]
I'm sorry, sir!

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:36.989
The guards were in the
middle of changing shifts!

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:39.125
No excuses! To the tower!

00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:41.093
Somebody help me, please!

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.729
There's a human
here in my chambers!

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:46.833
A bloodthirsty human aiming
to kill me, I'm certain!

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:50.436
Huh? No! Hey!
Quit makin' up stuff!

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.871
I just wanted that food!

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:54.340
I didn't even know you
were in here, all right?

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:56.742
[gasps]

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:03.216
[gasps]

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:04.183
Huh?

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:09.255
[LUFFY grunting]

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:11.457
[yelling]

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:21.133
[pants]

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.604
The heck was that?
Who's throwin' axes?

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:33.312
[USOPP]
Jeez, c'mon, already!

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.249
Where's this banquet?
I'm getting tired of waiting.

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:38.351
My stomach is growling.

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:39.552
Oh, hold on.

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:41.721
I don't even have a
stomach that can growl.

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:44.290
[laughs]

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:45.658
--[NAMI] Hey!
--[BROOK] Yes?

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:47.226
I have a funny feeling

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.862
that this banquet's
not happening.

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:52.265
[USOPP]
Ugh. What now?

00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:54.400
I thought we'd been
pretty good guests so far.

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:55.801
What's happening?

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:58.638
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT] I hate to
detain you like this, however,

00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:02.008
we've just received a rather
distressing call saying that

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:06.112
you people are suspects in
two ongoing investigations!

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:08.581
What? Suspects? For what crime?

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:10.049
First!

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:12.685
Multiple charges of
Mermaid kidnapping!

00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:14.620
Whoa, we would never
do something like th--

00:09:14.654 --> 00:09:16.255
Second!

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:18.925
By reason of Madam
Sharley's premonition,

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.894
your crew is suspected of
bringing potential calamity

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:23.129
to Fishman Island!

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:25.731
Huh? Wait, seriously?

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.400
So you're suspecting
us of something

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.235
that hasn't even happened yet!

00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:30.036
[PAPPAGU]
Shut up!

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.237
[NAMI]
They need to shut up!

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.607
[NEPTUNE] Hm... Is this
the right course of action?

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.942
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Based on these charges,

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:39.011
we will take your
crew into custody!

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:40.846
Do not let them escape!

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.150
Protect Fishman Island
at any cost!

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.484
[GUARDS]
Yeah!

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:47.453
Seize them!

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:51.891
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Princess Shirahoshi!

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:54.060
What's all that noise?

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:55.194
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Sorry.

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:56.395
[LUFFY yelps]

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.097
Is everything
all right, Princess?

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.332
[GUARD 532DD]
Are you injured somehow?

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:00.933
Um. I'm fine!

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:02.969
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT] You were
crying even louder than usual.

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:04.704
It gave us quite the fright!

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:06.939
Hey, put me dow--!

00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:08.507
Hold on, the door
was already open!

00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:10.443
Did you see any
intruders here, princess?

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:13.279
Uh, perhaps a strong
current opened it!

00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:15.982
I awoke crying from a
bad dream, that's all!

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:17.216
I need ai--!

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:19.685
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT] Hm?
I swear I just heard someone!

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:22.121
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Uh, no that's, well, um...

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:24.323
My... My stomach was rumbling!

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:25.891
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Oh? Are you certain?

00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:26.692
Shark!

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:27.627
Who goes there?

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.861
[MEGALO grunts]

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:31.564
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Megalo! You've returned!

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:34.000
Ah. That reminds me.

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:36.335
I have some rather dire
and vexing information

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:38.938
I must relay to you immediately.

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:42.141
It's regarding the pirate
who saved Megalo.

00:10:42.174 --> 00:10:45.878
The one known
as Straw Hat Luffy.

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:47.813
Some Mermaid girls
were kidnapped,

00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:50.182
and he's our prime suspect.

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:52.685
Also, based on a
troubling prediction

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:55.287
from Madam Sharley, the
Straw Hat crew is considered

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.690
a potential risk to
the entire kingdom.

00:10:57.723 --> 00:11:01.594
So we've locked them in the
palace prison, just to be safe.

00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:02.561
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]

00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:05.264
We already have the
swordsman in custody.

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:07.833
Upon arrival, he drank himself
into a state of compliance.

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:11.303
[grunts, snores]

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:12.872
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Three other members of the crew

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.940
have just arrived, and I imagine

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:16.942
they're in custody
as well by now.

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:18.544
But their captain...

00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:21.147
Well, he might be more
perceptive than he appears

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.449
and picked up on our intentions.

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:25.451
For he seems to have fled.

00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:28.254
He is almost certainly hiding
somewhere in the palace.

00:11:28.287 --> 00:11:30.823
So please, be careful.

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:33.325
We'll catch the rest of them
on the island in no time.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:34.827
I can promise you that.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.030
We will defend this country as
well as your home at any cost.

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:40.566
[stomach growls]

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:42.234
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT] What was
that? I heard something.

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:44.603
[SHIRAHOSHI] Are you sure?
You sound paranoid.

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:45.971
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
No, I'm sure that I--

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:47.506
[SHIRAHOSHI]
It was just your imagination!

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.341
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Well, what I wanted to say...

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.410
I feel awful that
we have to arrest

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:54.680
the people who saved Megalo.
I know how much he means to you.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.615
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Shh!

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:57.817
Princess?

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.453
You're acting a bit strange.
Are you hiding some--

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:03.055
[GUARD 532C]
Minister. We must leave.

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:06.425
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Oh. Five minutes already?

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:08.227
Well, we'll be going now.

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:19.071
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Check every lock on those doors!

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:23.275
[locks clicking]

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:24.677
[SHIRAHOSHI]
You saved me.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.513
Thank you so much. I'm sorry.

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:29.615
I should've given
you a chance earlier.

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:31.350
I hope you'll forgive me.

00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:33.619
If I had only known
who you were.

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:36.088
That you were the one
who saved Megalo.

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:37.857
[MEGALO]
Shark! Shark!

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.492
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Not to be overly familiar,

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:40.993
but may I call you Luffy?

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:41.727
Yeah, sure.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.028
So, Luffy,

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:45.297
they said that you're
a pirate, right?

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:47.533
Does that mean
you're a bad person?

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:50.636
Oh, I dunno.

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:52.505
I think I'll let you
make that call.

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:54.473
Okay.

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:56.609
Oh. I don't know
if you just heard,

00:12:56.642 --> 00:12:59.445
but our soldiers have taken
your friends into custody.

00:12:59.478 --> 00:13:01.413
Yeah. That's no big deal.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.916
Trust me on this, there's no way
your guys can keep them

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:04.850
locked up for long.

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:06.218
Really? Huh.

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:08.254
Yeah. Don't worry
about it, though.

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:11.991
So, what's with the ax?
Lemme hear it.

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:15.394
You know who threw the thing?
Were they trying to hit you?

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:21.033
[SHIRAHOSHI] I know who
threw it, and yes, he was.

00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:24.236
His name is Vander Decken,
and he's a pirate.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.439
He wanted to marry
me and I refused,

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:30.109
so he wants to kill me now.

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:33.078
And he will. There's no escape.

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:37.316
You see, he ate
the Mark-Mark fruit.

00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:40.085
And he used that
power to "mark" me.

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:43.556
All he has to do is throw a
weapon, and it will find me.

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:46.225
Anywhere, any time.

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:48.794
[screams]

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:53.933
[DECKEN laughs]

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:56.435
That's why I never leave here.

00:13:56.468 --> 00:13:58.671
My only real chance
to continue living

00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:00.873
is being locked away inside
the Hard Shell Tower.

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:02.808
[stomach growls]

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:08.681
I'm so hungry!

00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:27.666
Ooh! Oh, yummy!
I can eat all this?

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.168
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Go ahead.

00:14:31.837 --> 00:14:33.505
[LUFFY]
So good!

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:36.976
[LUFFY]
So this creep wants to marry you

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:40.913
but he's trying to kill you?
Doesn't make much sense, huh?

00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:42.848
'Cause it's usually
one or the other.

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:45.484
Yes. I've been
in here ten years.

00:14:45.517 --> 00:14:48.854
[LUFFY] Ten whole years?
Man, you must be bored!

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.756
Indeed, and my father made

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:53.292
a well-meaning but
misguided rule.

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:58.364
So now no one can visit
for more than five minutes.

00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:01.467
Which is why Megalo's
my only real friend.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.168
Without him...

00:15:03.202 --> 00:15:05.938
Well, I wouldn't have
anyone to talk to.

00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:07.640
[LUFFY] Yeah, they were
gonna throw a big banquet

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:09.575
to thank us for savin' him.

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:14.546
Guessin' that's
been canceled now.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.116
It's so awful.
Why would they do that?

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:20.185
They don't have to
throw you all in prison.

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:24.290
[SHIRAHOSHI] Though from what
I've heard about Madam Sharley,

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:28.360
all of her premonitions have
been astoundingly accurate.

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:31.030
I suppose that explains
the nature of their caution,

00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:33.666
--but still...
--[LUFFY slurping]

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:35.134
Or maybe they were just worried

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:38.137
you would consume the entire
kingdom's food supply.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:41.941
You humans sure do eat a lot
despite how small you are.

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:44.109
[LUFFY]
That's the old guy's fault.

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:47.613
He made a big fuss
about the banquet.

00:15:47.646 --> 00:15:50.883
But then he kept
getting yelled at.

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:52.952
I finally couldn't
wait any longer,

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:55.254
so I followed the smell here.

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:57.823
Hey, by the way, did they
call you "Princess"?

00:15:57.856 --> 00:15:59.291
Yes.

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:01.160
[LUFFY]
So you're <i>the</i> Mermaid Princess?

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:02.261
Yes.

00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:04.964
That does come with being
King Neptune's daughter.

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:07.599
My name is Shirahoshi.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:08.567
Shi-what?

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.802
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Shirahoshi.

00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:12.638
Uh... That's too tough to say.

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:14.206
Ooh! I'm eatin' that!

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:16.208
[SHIRAHOSHI giggles]

00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:18.010
You know, I could be wrong,

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:21.513
but you haven't struck me
as a bad person so far.

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:22.982
Are you an adventurer?

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:25.351
Is that why you decided
to become a pirate?

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:26.118
[LUFFY]
Uh-huh.

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:27.386
How wonderful.

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:31.023
Then you must have seen the sun
many times in your adventures.

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:32.124
Oh, yeah!

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:34.860
And what do the stars
in the night sky look like?

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:36.462
Oh! I bet you've seen

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:39.631
all sorts of animals,
and flowers, too, huh?

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:40.966
Now, what else?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.867
Oh, right!

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.402
Have you ever been
to the green place?

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:45.904
I think perhaps people
call it a "forest"?

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:48.874
[LUFFY] Hey, relax,
you ask too many questions!

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:51.844
--Just gimme a sec!
--[SHIRAHOSHI] Sure.

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:55.047
It's cute how full
your cheeks are!

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.548
Poke!

00:16:56.582 --> 00:16:58.984
Stop it! What the heck
is wrong with you?!

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:03.689
[gasps] Puh, puh,
please, don't.

00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:07.426
Please don't yell at me!
I just can't handle it!

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:12.364
Oh, no. You're such a-a brute.

00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:16.602
[sobs]

00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:17.636
Whoa, calm down!

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:20.639
This is nothing
to cry over! Stop!

00:17:20.672 --> 00:17:23.042
No one has ever
yelled at me before!

00:17:23.075 --> 00:17:25.744
And I don't like it!
It's horrible!

00:17:25.778 --> 00:17:28.047
[sobs]

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.151
How can someone so big be
such a coward and a crybaby?

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:34.453
Y'know. I don't
think I like you.

00:17:35.587 --> 00:17:36.688
[laughs]

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:38.123
[whines]

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:40.726
[SHIRAHOSHI]
How could you say that?

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:43.562
No one's ever said such
an awful thing to me.

00:17:43.595 --> 00:17:45.564
You're such a terrible man!

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:48.467
Please! Just go.
I want you to leave!

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.571
I can't take it!
It hurts too much!

00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:56.942
Ah! I am full!
Thanks for the grub!

00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:58.577
With as long as you've
been stuck in here,

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.512
no wonder you're
scared of everything.

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:01.980
Leave, Luffy.

00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:03.515
Just please get out of here!

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:04.616
[LUFFY]
I could.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.119
But, isn't there someplace
that you wanna go?

00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:09.088
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Huh?

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.657
Well, of course there is.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.860
There are lots of places
that I'd love to see. Why?

00:18:14.893 --> 00:18:16.395
[LUFFY]
Thought you'd say that.

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:18.397
So, let's get outta here!

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.331
What?

00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:20.933
Let's go take a stroll!

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:23.035
No, I'm not supposed to.

00:18:23.068 --> 00:18:24.203
I can't do that.

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:26.538
[LUFFY]
Why not? Just do it!

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.275
--You'll be okay!
--[SHIRAHOSHI, MEGALO] Huh?

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:33.479
[LUFFY] If that guy throws
somethin' at you, fine.

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:35.614
I'll take it down,
just like the last time.

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:36.949
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:41.019
[snoring]

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:42.654
[CELL GUARD 532A]
Look at this guy.

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:45.958
Passed out, sleepin' like
a baby in a jail cell.

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:49.094
You didn't see how much booze
this one drank, did you?

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.295
Hurry up!

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:51.797
[CELL GUARD 532B]
They seem awful worked up.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.966
What's goin' on?

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:56.869
[snoring]

00:18:56.902 --> 00:19:00.239
Usopp- <i>chin</i> ! Nami- <i>chin</i> !
Brook- <i>chin</i> !

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:07.579
Apprehend them now!

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:10.649
They're just three
measly humans!

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:12.384
Don't do anything dumb!

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:14.386
Please, you gotta
stop resisting!

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:16.855
You really will be
criminals if you don't!

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:20.459
Yet, there is no just cause
for them to lock us up.

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:21.727
Sorry, Camie.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.564
This is such a total letdown.
I really wanted that banquet.

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:28.066
[USOPP] At this point, playing
nice won't do much good.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.968
You heard what he said:
they've made up their minds

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:32.404
about what kind
of people we are.

00:19:32.437 --> 00:19:33.672
[GUARDS]
Huh?

00:19:33.705 --> 00:19:36.975
If they desire, we'll stay and
fight them till the end of time.

00:19:38.777 --> 00:19:40.679
Surely the three of them
aren't that strong.

00:19:40.712 --> 00:19:42.181
They must be bluffing.

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:46.218
Listen up, no one knows
what the future holds.

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:48.854
So, whether we're
heroes or villains,

00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:50.956
you still shouldn't cross us.

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:54.393
Is it me or has he really
gotten his act together?

00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:56.728
[CAMIE] Seems like Brook- <i>chin</i>
and Nami- <i>chin</i> got stronger

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:59.398
over the past two years as well!

00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:01.733
See? This is the very prologue

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:03.602
to the future
that's been foreseen!

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:05.170
Then it's your fault!

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:07.306
We wouldn't have fought
back in the first place

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:09.841
if you guys didn't
insist on fighting us!

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.476
[NEPTUNE grunts]
Good point.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.478
Ha! But this is nothin'.

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:15.814
Not compared to the giant
insect attack I went through

00:20:15.847 --> 00:20:18.050
back when I was on
the Bowin islands.

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:19.585
[BROOK grunts]

00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:21.119
[grunts]

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:24.957
[USOPP] Behold! My new
weapon, Black Kabuto!

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.927
Ha. I'm happy to give
you a demonstration.

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:32.297
Please, King Neptune,
we need your help!

00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:35.801
[NEPTUNE] Hm. Is it really
fair to arrest someone

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:39.605
based on a prediction that
they will commit a crime?

00:20:39.638 --> 00:20:42.241
I need time to
contemplate this.

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:46.745
It's a precarious situation.
And until I decide,

00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:50.949
you will have to
wait in custody!

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:52.618
[BROOK]
He's quite formidable!

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:57.990
[NEPTUNE grunts]
Surrender!

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:01.493
[NAMI]
Zoro!

00:21:01.526 --> 00:21:03.862
Hold on. I thought
they locked you up!

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:05.864
Sounded like you guys
were havin' some fun,

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:08.867
so here I am.

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:13.672
Okay, Captain Decken,
this is it!

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:16.041
[DECKEN] Just wait for
me there, Wadatsumi.

00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:18.977
Sure. Aye-aye, Captain.

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:20.012
This way.

00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:23.115
[DECKEN] Of course.
Thanks for your patience.

00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:27.152
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES cheer]

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:28.854
[FISHMAN PIRATE 531AA]
Vander Decken's here!

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:30.656
I knew he'd come!

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:34.559
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE 532B]
Welcome!

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:37.396
[DECKEN] Sorry to keep
you gentlemen waiting.

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:40.065
We ran into a bit of
a volcanic eruption.

00:21:40.098 --> 00:21:41.533
A pity.

00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:45.370
And you must be
the notorious Hordy.

00:21:45.404 --> 00:21:47.205
I suspect.

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:49.908
Enough flattery.
You're notorious.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.580
We both are,
Nutty Vander Decken.

00:21:57.683 --> 00:21:58.984
Pleasure to meet ya.

00:21:59.017 --> 00:22:00.952
A formal handshake?

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.321
Just a moment.

00:22:02.354 --> 00:22:04.589
That's a bit tricky
for a fellow like me.

00:22:04.623 --> 00:22:06.024
Huh?

00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:08.193
There we go!

00:22:08.226 --> 00:22:09.261
Uh...

00:22:09.294 --> 00:22:11.763
Ah. Never mind.

00:22:11.797 --> 00:22:14.266
Nice to meet you, too.

00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:18.270
It's a pleasure.
Mister Hordy Jones.

00:22:18.303 --> 00:22:21.306
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES cheer]

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.042
[ZEO] Nothing on the
seafloor can stop us now.

00:22:24.076 --> 00:22:27.212
The worst of the worst
together at last!

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:41.193
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES chanting]
Decken! Decken! Hordy! Hordy!

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:44.963
King Neptune is a royal
nuisance for you and I alike.

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:46.398
I'm sure.

00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:49.401
Oh, yeah. We've got
the same goal here.

00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:52.671
His army--they take no
pride in being Fishmen.

00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:55.607
So together, we
will conquer them.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.578
And then we kill Neptune,
God of the Sea.

00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:01.279
[HORDY]
And lastly...

00:23:01.313 --> 00:23:03.382
[DECKEN]
...we will destroy...

00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:05.984
[BOTH]
...the entire Ryugu Kingdom!

00:23:15.093 --> 00:23:17.229
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
face off with Neptune.

00:23:17.262 --> 00:23:18.997
While they have the
upper hand at first,

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.299
Neptune's soldiers threaten
to pop their bubble,

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:23.769
leaving them to drown in
the underwater chambers.

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:26.538
Meanwhile, Luffy and
Shirahoshi avoid the pirates'

00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:28.507
attempted infiltration
of the Tower.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.743
The peaceful Ryugu Palace
soon devolves into chaos.

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:33.445
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.478 --> 00:23:37.182
"It's an Emergency!
The Ryugu Palace is Occupied!"

00:23:37.215 --> 00:23:39.551
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
