1
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:19,586
[GOLD ROGER]
Destiny. Fate. Dreams.

2
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:24,257
These unstoppable ideals are
held deep in the heart of man.

3
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:27,594
As long as there are people
who seek freedom in this life,

4
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:30,764
these things shall not
vanish from the earth!

5
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,407
<i>People tell me my</i>
<i>head's in the clouds</i>

6
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,708
<i>I don't care what they say</i>

7
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,543
<i>because I'm dreamin' of you</i>

8
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,479
<i>You are the treasure I've found</i>

9
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,282
<i>So bright, so bold,</i>
<i>yet so elusive</i>

10
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,785
<i>It's hard to look away,</i>

11
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,821
<i>even though it's blinding me</i>

12
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,489
<i>There are no words to describe</i>

13
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,425
<i>how I feel inside</i>

14
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,795
<i>I'm really really stuck</i>
<i>on you whoa, whoa!</i>

15
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,463
<i>I have to follow my dreams</i>

16
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,898
<i>however crazy they seem</i>

17
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,334
<i>And I won't stop 'til I</i>
<i>get there, you will see</i>

18
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,502
<i>You're all I need</i>

19
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,671
<i>to have the strength to believe</i>

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:17,811
<i>Believe in Wonderland!</i>

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,948
<i>I'm gonna follow my dreams,</i>

22
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,616
<i>however crazy they seem</i>

23
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,251
<i>I'm gonna share them with you,</i>

24
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,786
<i>a love so true</i>

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,323
<i>You're all I want,</i>
<i>together we can move on</i>

26
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,792
<i>Live how we want to!</i>

27
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,427
<i>There is no limit to us,</i>

28
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,862
<i>we have the power of love</i>

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,265
<i>And we don't wanna</i>
<i>live ordinary lives</i>

30
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,669
<i>We have the chance</i>
<i>to live in paradise</i>

31
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:50,376
<i>Believe in Wonderland!</i>

32
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,952
[LUFFY]
Hey, look! We're out!

33
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,721
[LT COMMANDER] All ships are
to pursue them immediately!

34
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:02,989
Eric just
reappeared as well.

35
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:06,025
We'll have to wait for him to
reboard before we go after them.

36
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,330
[USOPP]
Woohoo! Eat our sails!

37
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,065
[NAMI] But once we stop
at Warship Island,

38
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,733
they're going to catch up.

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,137
Guys, what're we gonna do then?
Do we even have a plan?

40
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,004
We'll be okay!

41
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,739
Oh, yeah?! How?!

42
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,841
All we have to do is
find the Dragons' Nest,

43
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,911
and then Grandpa Ryu will
get better and help us out!

44
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,814
I hate to be the
bearer of bad news.

45
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,385
[laughing]

46
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:36,356
The small fries have leapt
forth! Good! Now is the time!

47
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,325
All ships, take up positions
to the left and right!

48
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,095
Crane Wing Formation!

49
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,764
What do we do?!
They have us blocked off!

50
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,765
We jump onto those ships,

51
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,268
fight off the Marines,
and cut those links!

52
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,903
It's our only choice!

53
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,105
Huh. Actually,
it's not a bad idea.

54
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,941
[LUFFY]
All right! Let's go!

55
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,377
[laughs]

56
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,212
Bring it on!

57
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,248
[LUFFY]
"Luffy, Completely Surrounded!

58
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,351
Commodore Nelson's
Secret Strategy!"

59
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,333
[NELSON laughing]

60
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,836
[NELSON] Marvelous! A truly
beautiful sight to behold!

61
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,072
[NELSON laughing]

62
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,940
Hear me! Continue the attacks!

63
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,009
We will not relent
for an instant.

64
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:03,576
[MARINE C]
Yes, sir!

65
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,577
But be careful.

66
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,347
I don't want so much as
a scratch on that raft.

67
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,983
Right! Understood.

68
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,019
[chuckles]

69
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,489
For years, the Millennial
Dragon eluded me.

70
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:19,859
Now the beast is finally
within my grasp!

71
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,362
What this victory really
means is the Dragonite,

72
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,598
the Elixir of Immortality,
is now as good as mine!

73
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:29,369
[laughing]

74
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,516
[MARINE B]
Sir!

75
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,618
The Commodore's flagship
says his plan has succeeded

76
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:49,889
and that the attack on
the enemy is still ongoing!

77
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,457
[LT COMMANDER] Apparently,
this mission is over.

78
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,326
Our job is complete.

79
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,035
[ERIC] If Nelson gets his fat
hands on them now,

80
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,503
he'll ruin everything.

81
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,239
I won't allow it!

82
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,408
[ERIC]
Hold on, Lieutenant Commander!

83
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,645
What do you want now?

84
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,580
I need you to provide
me a rowboat.

85
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,184
In addition, I'll require three
of your crew to man it.

86
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:21,421
[LT COMMANDER] A rowboat?!
And why would you need that?!

87
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,159
Because a mast would
just be in the way.

88
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,595
You can't row into
the battle zone!

89
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,165
[ERIC] You're not here to
tell me what I can't do.

90
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,500
Now do as I say.

91
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,244
[USOPP]
Apis!

92
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,281
It's dangerous out here!
Now go back inside!

93
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,285
But I can't leave Grandpa
Ryu all by himself!

94
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,188
Hold on! Come back here!

95
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,593
Have you lost your mind?!
You'll kill yourself! Apis!

96
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,062
[APIS]
Grandpa Ryu.

97
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,231
Hang in there just
a little bit longer.

98
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,699
I'm gonna get you
to the Dragons' Nest.

99
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,435
I promise you that.

100
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,603
Man, she's brave!

101
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,473
Look at her!
She loves that dragon.

102
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,708
All right, you can
count on me, Apis.

103
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,310
I'll help you break
through the front lines

104
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,313
and reach the
Dragons' Nest, okay?

105
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,616
[USOPP screams]

106
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:28,988
[USOPP]
They got us!

107
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:32,125
They circled around and
attacked from behind!

108
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:36,129
Sanji! We've been hit! Sanji!

109
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,664
We're doomed! It's over!

110
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,168
[SANJI] Pipe down, will ya?
We haven't been hit.

111
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,169
[USOPP]
Seriously?

112
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,637
[SANJI]
Yeah.

113
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,838
[USOPP]
I'm saved!

114
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:49,275
Who was the one going around
saying we'd been hit anyway?

115
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,411
That was you.

116
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,080
[LUFFY]
Yeah, that's it! Go!

117
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,984
[laughing]

118
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,330
Hey! Cannonball coming this way!

119
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,534
I can't do any more from here!
You do something about it!

120
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,536
[LUFFY]
No problem! I'm on it!

121
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,172
And Gum‐Gum...

122
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,007
...Balloon!

123
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,613
Oh, wow!

124
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,450
No way!

125
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,518
Those impudent bastards!

126
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,788
How dare they defile
one of my warships!

127
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,223
What are you doing?!

128
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,625
Strike them down with
the Super Giant Cannon!

129
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,027
Sir!

130
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,065
[NELSON] There will be
no leniency! No mercy!

131
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,569
No escape for you
wretched heathens!

132
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,072
[MARINE H] Prepare to fire
the Super Giant Cannon!

133
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:58,077
[alarm blaring]

134
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,820
[MARINE E] The enemy vessel
has been trapped dead ahead!

135
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,756
Ready to fire!

136
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,091
We're in trouble!

137
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,559
One hit from that
monstrous cannon

138
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,428
and our ship will be
blown to shreds!

139
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,829
[LUFFY]
We'll be fine!

140
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,364
I'll just bounce it back.

141
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,065
[NAMI growls]

142
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,233
We need a permanent solution!

143
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,503
I'll turn the ship around!
You guys work the rear sail!

144
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,103
Go!

145
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,371
[LUFFY, ZORO]
Right!

146
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,540
You like shooting cannons?!

147
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,276
All right, you buncha Marine
thugs, I got a shot for ya!

148
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,845
[LUFFY]
Okay, here we go!

149
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,680
Eat this!

150
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,719
Fire!

151
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,187
[MARINE E]
Yes, sir!

152
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,694
[NELSON coughs]

153
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:52,398
What the hell just happened?

154
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,200
An enemy cannonball
slammed directly

155
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,468
into our main cannon, Sir!

156
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,638
You morons!

157
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,540
Don't just stand there!
Lift me up!

158
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,574
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

159
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,476
[USOPP] How'd that medicine
go down, fellas?!

160
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,644
That's what happens
when you get served

161
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,779
a heaping helping
of Usopp Payback!

162
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,714
[SANJI] Big talk for
someone who got lucky.

163
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:09,815
[ZORO]
You're full of it.

164
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,716
[USOPP]
That was pure skill, guys!

165
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:16,489
Wow. Direct hit!
You're amazing, Usopp!

166
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,724
Uh. Yeah!

167
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,566
It'll be fine.
Don't worry, okay?

168
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,668
All you have to do is
keep protecting Apis.

169
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,669
We'll do the rest.

170
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,470
Hey, who are you talking to?

171
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,672
Grandpa Ryu.

172
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,673
Eh?

173
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,341
Now's our best chance!

174
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,610
If we act quickly, we can cut
through their barricade

175
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,844
and clear a path outta here!

176
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,780
That's a great idea.

177
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:41,614
Luffy?

178
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,249
Leave it to me!

179
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,451
Gum‐Gum...

180
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,453
...Bridge!

181
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,926
[LUFFY]
Yeah!

182
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,663
Hang in there Grandpa Ryu!

183
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,534
Here goes!

184
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,602
[yelps]

185
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,805
Hey, nice catch.

186
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,440
Damn you!

187
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,511
Report. What is the
status of the enemy?

188
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,379
[MARINE C]
Sir!

189
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,981
The enemy has
breached our defenses.

190
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,616
Three of the pirates
have been able to board

191
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,351
ship one on the portside.

192
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,653
What?! That's unacceptable!

193
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,030
Chains of steel, huh?

194
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,298
[LUFFY]
Can ya cut 'em?

195
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,667
[ZORO] There isn't
anything I can't cut.

196
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,636
[LUFFY]
Great! Get to it!

197
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,184
This is overkill.

198
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,320
I'll take the right side,
and you take the left.

199
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,855
Whatever.

200
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,156
I'll leave these guys to you.

201
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,324
[LUFFY, SANJI]
Thanks!

202
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,926
No one gets by the fighting
Marines of the Nelson Fleet!

203
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,194
You're dead, pirates!

204
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,697
[MARINES yell]

205
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,219
[USOPP]
Yeah! That's it! Way to go!

206
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,089
Show those pirate‐hating bullies
who really owns the sea!!

207
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,793
Beat 'em! Sink 'em!
Slice 'em into chum!

208
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,194
[growling]

209
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,096
Those vermin think
they can break through

210
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,065
my magnificent chain?!

211
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,866
You'll capture them
at all costs!

212
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,369
Or I swear I'll maroon every
last Marine in this fleet!

213
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,938
[MARINES yelling]

214
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,742
Now Gum‐Gum Gatling!

215
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,726
[laughing]

216
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,260
Here they come!

217
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,102
Now Gum‐Gum...

218
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,069
...Pinball!

219
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,838
[LUFFY laughing]

220
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,821
[LUFFY chuckles]

221
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,598
They're so amazing.
I had no idea.

222
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,104
There's only one chain left!
Let's get moving!

223
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,140
Huh? You got it, Nami!

224
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,676
Don't stand there, you
imbeciles! Somebody stop them!

225
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,288
[screams]

226
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,976
[chuckles]

227
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,812
[NELSON]
Oh, Eric!

228
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,146
Excellent work!

229
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,650
Now the Millennial Dragon
is mine for the taking!

230
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,265
What was that?

231
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,203
I know you!
You're that sicko guy!

232
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,706
It's not "Sicko."
It's "Sickle," you brat!

233
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,345
Enough! You've lost! Now hand
over the Millennial Dragon!

234
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:10,783
Stay back! You can't have him!
You'll never get Grandpa Ryu!

235
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,518
Give him to me right now!

236
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,919
No!

237
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,923
Keep in mind I have the ability
to slice you into ribbons

238
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:21,026
at any given moment.

239
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,028
Stop right there!

240
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,463
Lay one fingernail on that kid

241
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,098
and I'll make you
beg for death!

242
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,299
[USOPP]
Yeah!

243
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,401
A‐And then you'll have to deal
with me, ya creepy sicko!

244
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:29,935
[chuckles]

245
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,105
More empty threats.

246
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,740
Fair warning, little pirates.

247
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,042
My wind slash missed
you on purpose.

248
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,244
[gasps]

249
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,385
A demonstration.
The next one will cost you.

250
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,555
Force me, and I'll blow
your ship apart.

251
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,990
[LUFFY]
What's wrong?

252
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,893
It's him.

253
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,128
Huh. So what's he doing?

254
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,096
[ERIC]
Tie their raft...

255
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,297
[ZORO] Looks like he's
stealing the dragon

256
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,899
and taking Apis hostage.

257
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,433
[LUFFY]
Oh no he's not!

258
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,001
Stop!

259
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,235
If you try to fight him,

260
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:07,139
he might kill Apis and the
others with his wind slash move.

261
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,341
All right. No punching.

262
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,244
I'll kick him.

263
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,446
Will you listen to me?!

264
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,982
[ERIC] I'll be taking the
Millennial Dragon now!

265
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,250
Nothing personal!

266
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:22,254
[USOPP] Oh, it's personal!
Give Apis back!

267
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:26,525
Excellent work, Eric!
Now bring the beast here.

268
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,428
[ERIC] I'm sorry, Nelson,
but this prize isn't for you.

269
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,932
[NELSON]
Huh?! What did you say?!

270
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,267
[ERIC] The only reason I obeyed
your ludicrous demands

271
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,103
was to use your fleet's ability
to gather information.

272
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,939
[NELSON]
Excuse me?!

273
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,107
[ERIC] Don't pretend
you're any different.

274
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,276
You tried to use me
with just as much vigor.

275
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,313
[NELSON] I spent a great sum
of money for your services!

276
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,114
[ERIC] I've worked off
that chump change

277
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,816
you threw me by now.

278
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:54,453
So I'm done taking orders from
you, you blubbering sea lion.

279
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,189
Sea lion?! Blubbering?!

280
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,857
I have big plans
for the Dragonite

281
00:15:58,891 --> 00:15:59,825
this beast will provide.

282
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,294
I'm going to make myself
exquisitely perfect!

283
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,331
[growls]

284
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,633
[NELSON]
You'll pay for this betrayal!

285
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:12,571
I want this backstabber dead!
Shoot him. Kill him!

286
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,982
It's starting all over again!

287
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,921
[ERIC]
If you want to survive,

288
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,924
I suggest you start rowing
with greater enthusiasm!

289
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,759
[MARINES sream]

290
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,331
[APIS]
Stop...

291
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,005
Please stop harassing
Grandpa Ryu!

292
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,173
He hasn't done anything to you!

293
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,343
Do you hear me?! All he wants
is to be left alone in peace!

294
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,912
Oh, quit your whining.

295
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,514
I have to take Grandpa Ryu

296
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,616
back to the Dragons'
Nest or he'll die!

297
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,885
Just let us go!

298
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,520
Ah! What's the
matter with you?!

299
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,056
Let me go! Let me go!

300
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,959
You are now my hostage.
End of discussion.

301
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,127
And while we're on the subject,

302
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,195
the Millennial Dragon
belongs to me.

303
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,031
[APIS] Grandpa Ryu
doesn't belong to you

304
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:12,898
and he never will!

305
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,901
He deserves to be free!

306
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,037
That's all I can
stand from you.

307
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,540
If another word escapes your
lips, I'll tear you apart!

308
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:25,210
[ERIC screams]

309
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,545
Enough of this!

310
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,053
Damn kid. Serves her right.

311
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,423
[MARINES screaming]

312
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,291
What are you morons
running from?!

313
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:43,996
Hey! Hey! Hm?

314
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,566
[screaming]

315
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,746
[APIS laughing]

316
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,683
[APIS] Are you hungry, Grandpa?!
Try some of this. It's yummy!

317
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,685
You need to get
your strength back!

318
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:11,123
Don't worry, I'm not leaving
your side until you get better.

319
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,257
You're gorgeous!

320
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:16,095
The flowers really bring out
the color in your eyes!

321
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:27,806
[roars]

322
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:50,896
[MARINES yelling]

323
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,632
I can't take the noise!

324
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,503
Oh no! Make it stop!

325
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,807
Yeah, so Grandpa Ryu is loud.

326
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,054
[gasps]

327
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,891
Grandpa! You stood up!

328
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:19,925
That's great!

329
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,994
[APIS laughing]

330
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,895
[APIS]
You're back!

331
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,330
[APIS laughing]

332
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,533
Huh? What?

333
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,844
Really?!

334
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,048
Oh, boy!

335
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,883
You don't suppose he's...?

336
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,954
That's it! Fly Grandpa Ryu!
You can do it!

337
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,693
[APIS] You did it, Grandpa!
You're flying!

338
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,228
[APIS laughing]

339
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,763
Unacceptable!

340
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,932
If I can't possess the
Millennial Dragon...

341
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,300
...then no one will!

342
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,936
Kill it! Shoot it down from
the sky immediately!

343
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,772
All I need is the Dragonite!

344
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,214
[APIS screams]

345
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,249
[APIS]
No, stop!

346
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,618
Fly away, Grandpa! Go high!

347
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,222
Find someplace where the
cannons can't reach you!

348
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,728
Shoot it down quickly!
Now! Kill it now!

349
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,098
Leave him alone!

350
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,243
Now's your chance
to escape! Hurry!

351
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,911
[NELSON]
What are you waiting for?!

352
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,247
Blow it away! Fire all cannons!

353
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:48,914
[MARINE C]
Yes, sir!

354

Hang in there, I'll help you.

Hey, what are you
trying to get at?

366

Don't you talk about dying!

367
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,524
[LUFFY] Believe me, I know
where you're comin' from.

368
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,294
I won't let anything happen
to Apis, I promise.

369
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,364
And I'll make sure you get
back to the Dragons' Nest.

370
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,233
Now promise me
you'll stay alive.
