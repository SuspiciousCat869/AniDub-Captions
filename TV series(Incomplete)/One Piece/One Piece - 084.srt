[yells]

172
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,726
Just what are you anyway?

173
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,461
You don't look like
a human being.

174
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,564
You must be that yeti everyone
is talking about in the village.

175
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,398
[CHOPPER shouts]

176
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,900
[HIRILUK grunts]

177
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:58,938
[shouting continues]

178
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,078
[VILLAGER A]
Yeah! We got him!

179
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,081
[VILLAGER C]
It wasn't enough! Finish him!

180
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:14,287
[pants]

181
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:23,796
[HIRILUK grunts]
How dare you.

182
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,400
Who do you think...

183
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,769
...you're dealing
with, creature?

184
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,971
[HIRILUK]
Hey! Wait!

185
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,777
I promise I'm not gonna
shoot you, see?!

186
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,983
My name is Hiriluk.
Doctor Hiriluk!

187
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,452
And I want to help you!

188
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,325
[CHOPPER grunts]

189
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,838
[CHOPPER]
Hm?

190
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,480
[sneezes]

191
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,351
[CHOPPER]
Hm?

192
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,356
[stomach growls]

193
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,741
[KUREHA]
That was the first encounter

194
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,644
between Chopper
and Doctor Hiriluk.

195
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,697
[NAMI]
So, what happened next?

196
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,199
Between Chopper
and Doctor Hiriluk?

197
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,504
[HIRILUK]
Wait. You can talk?

198
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,711
[HIRILUK]
Why have you kept silent?

199
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,280
[CHOPPER] I thought you'd
hate me if I talked.

200
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,117
When I talked to humans the
other day, they shot at me.

201
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:29,555
You see, people think
I'm a freak for that.

202
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,792
So you can talk, so what.

203
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,460
Even children learn to talk.

204
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,463
I don't see what's so
damn special about it?

205
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,297
[HIRILUK]
Hm?

206
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,700
Aah! Run, Chopper!

207
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,068
Huh?

208
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,305
[CHOPPER, HIRILUK yell]

209
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,809
Aw. I thought for
sure that would work.

210
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,645
Hey, Chopper, are you okay?

211
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,380
[CHOPPER grunts]

212
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,650
Eh? Well, at least your
head was bandaged

213
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,318
to begin with, right?

214
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:03,789
[chuckles]

215
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,326
[CHOPPER] Mm? Hey, did you
call me Chopper?

216
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,496
That's your new name.
Tony Tony Chopper.

217
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,498
I picked it because I thought
you looked like you could

218
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,601
chop down a tree with
those antlers of yours.

219
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,403
Cool name, huh?

220
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:21,741
Anyway, that's what
I'm gonna call ya. [laughs]

221
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:26,679
Chopper... [chuckles]

222
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,314
[HIRILUK]
Now listen up, Chopper.

223
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,683
Always pay close attention
to your patients' symptoms

224
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,651
and give 'em proper treatment.

225
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,454
That's the way to
save a person's life.

226
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,860
Let's go! There are sick
people who need my help!

227
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,595
[VILLAGER D] Get outta here,
you crazy quack!

228
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,263
[HIRILUK, CHOPPER yell]

229
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,867
[HIRILUK] I thought lizard
eyeballs would work!

230
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,502
[VILLAGER E]
Don't ever come back!

231
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,370
[VILLAGER F]
Get lost!

232
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,672
[HIRILUK]
It's Wapol's guards! Run!

233
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,175
Chopper, it's time to
use the decoy plan!

234
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,209
[CHOPPER]
The what plan?!

235
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,711
[HIRILUK]
Good luck, pal!

236
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,448
[CHOPPER yells]

237
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,682
[CHOPPER]
Eh?

238
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,818
[CHOPPER] You almost got
me killed, you maniac!

239
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,052
[HIRILUK]
So what?

240
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,789
You already cheated death once,
you clumsy blue nosed caribou!

241
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,458
[CHOPPER] That's reindeer,
and don't call me blue nose!

242
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:17,229
[HIRILUK groans]

243
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,199
[CHOPPER groans]

244
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,805
[CHOPPER]
Doctor?

245
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:30,676
That's the first time I've
ever fought with anyone.

246
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,711
[laughs]

247
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,749
I can believe that, you have
to have an opponent to fight.

248
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,919
So is it your first time
for this as well?

249
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,657
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

250
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,558
[HIRILUK]
That's for you.

251
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:49,261
A gift, as a memento
of our making up.

252
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,864
Gift? Making up?

253
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,240
[HIRILUK]
Ya' know Chopper,

254
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,876
it sometimes feels that
things are pretty rough,

255
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,947
but try not to hold a grudge
against us humans, okay?

256
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,282
This country is sick right now.

257
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,550
[CHOPPER]
Hm?

258
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,452
The people and the king both
suffer from a terrible sickness

259
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,288
of the heart, and conventional
wisdom has it that there is no

260
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,592
way to cure a sick country,
but that's wrong!

261
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,560
Once my invention
has been perfected,

262
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,263
this country will
be as good as saved!

263
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,732
You see, there used
to be a master thief

264
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,301
who lived in a country
in the far west.

265
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,971
He had a serious
heart condition.

266
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,573
He went to the greatest
doctors he could find

267
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,643
to receive treatment, but no
one was able to cure him.

268
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,879
They told him he
was going to die.

269
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,482
Frustrated and depressed, he
passed by a certain mountain.

270
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:47,253
There he saw something he
had never seen before.

271
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,328
[HIRILUK]
Blossoms!

272
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,932
He saw cherry blossoms all
over the mountainside!

273
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,401
And then, he went to
see another doctor

274
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,671
and got the shock of his
life because he was told,

275
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,907
"you're perfectly healthy!"

276
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,941
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

277
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,977
He was cured! It was
a miracle! Don't you see?!

278
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,647
But it also makes perfect
sense medically speaking!

279
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,814
By changing his
emotional state,

280
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,985
he was able to change his
physical state somehow too!

281
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,120
And if that's true,

282
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:24,456
there's no disease in this
world that can't be cured!

283
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,925
Let them laugh at me!

284
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:30,496
My medical skills will
save this country yet!

285
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,699
And that's why I raised
this skull and crossbones!

286
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,769
As a challenge to all the
diseases of the world!

287
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:37,636
[CHOPPER]
Skull?

288
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,939
[HIRILUK]
This symbolizes my belief.

289
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,941
That nothing is impossible!

290
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:46,645
I will save this country
with my doctor's skills!

291
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,550
By raising this flag, I vow to
fight just like the pirates do!

292
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:57,523
[LUFFY] Hey! Reindeer!
Join us and be our friend!

293
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,792
[LUFFY gasps]
Booty!

294
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,894
[LUFFY giggles]

295
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,001
I love being a pirate!

296
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,704
[CHOPPER]
Doctor, what are pirates?

297
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,739
[HIRILUK]
Pirates?

298
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,375
They're dashing
swashbucklers of the sea!

299
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,011
With great strength and
the eyesight of eagles!

300
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,381
Their voices echo
like rolling thunder!

301
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,488
[LUFFY chuckles]

302
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,493
Hey! Y‐You're really a pirate?

303
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,427
[LUFFY]
Huh?

304
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,763
Well, yeah, of course I am.

305
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,998
It's like I've been
saying all along,

306
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,534
we do all kinds of fun stuff,
like fishing and singing!

307
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,938
Huh? P‐Pirates sing?

308
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,674
Sure we do and sometimes
we dance too!

309
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,676
[CHOPPER]
You call that being a pirate?!

310
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,445
Of course! And we
go on adventures!

311
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,915
You really do? Pirates really
do go on adventures?

312
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,417
Yeah, you bet we do!

313
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,886
Pirates risk their lives
to go on adventures!

314
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,422
And you meet the
most amazing people!

315
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,024
[HIRILUK]
It's great to be a pirate!

316
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,460
The most amazing
people sail the seas!

317
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,097
[HIRILUK] Chopper, some day
you've got to go to sea.

318
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,633
If you do, you'll realize just
how small your problems

319
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,103
really are in comparison to
the vastness of the oceans.

320
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:22,608
The island you were born on is
like this compared to the world!

321
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:23,642
[CHOPPER]
Really?

322
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,145
No, it's smaller! Like this!

323
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,147
Really!

324
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,950
[HIRILUK, CHOPPER laugh]

325
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,988
Your destiny lies beyond
that shining sea!

326
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,656
[KUREHA]
The good times passed

327
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,160
in the twinkling of an eye.

328
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,828
And then...

329
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,673
...it finally came time
to say farewell.

330
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,277
As it always does
in the end.

331
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,018
[HIRILUK]
It's taken a year,

332
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,454
but your treatment
is finally complete.

333
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,423
Your injuries
are healed, Chopper.

334
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,193
Yeah! Thank you, Doctor.

335
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,595
Well then, take care.

336
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,366
[HIRILUK] On your way!
Have a nice life!

337
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,669
I'm busy with my research!

338
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:24,770
So hit the bricks!

339
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:28,941
I'm no longer under any
obligation to care for you!

340
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:32,377
Doctor! I swear, I won't
cause you any trouble

341
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,646
if you'll just let me
stay with you!

342
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,448
I'll rub your
shoulders every day!

343
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:41,186
I'll make you tea and clean
the house! Please! Let me stay!

344
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,022
[CHOPPER]
I don't have any friends!

345
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,558
I don't have anywhere to go!

346
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:59,004
[CHOPPER] Doctor! Please!
Can you hear me? Doctor?!

347
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,173
[thudding]

348
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,374
Chopper!

349
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,080
I hurt my head. I... fell.

350
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,716
I'm injured!

351
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,417
Take a look!

352
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,321
[CHOPPER whimpers]

353
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,557
But why... doctor?

354
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:23,262
Go! Go to sea if you like!
Go anywhere you want!

355
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,696
Just don't come back!

356
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,735
‐‐[CHOPPER cries]
‐‐[HIRILUK whimpers]

357
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,748
Forgive me, Chopper.

358
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,796
[HIRILUK]
I'm... dying.

359
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:02,301
[KUREHA cackles]
Yes, you are.

360
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,704
[HIRILUK] Tell me the truth.
How many days do I have left?

361
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,407
[KUREHA] Excuse me?
This isn't a charity ward.

362
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,109
You don't have the
money to pay my fee.

363
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,646
Tell me.

364
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:24,323
You can't kill a person with
a tranquilizer gun, ya know.

365
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,626
All right, I'll tell you.
Ten days from now, you'll die.

366
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,162
So now ya know.

367
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,764
Ten? That'll be enough.

368
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,467
In two days, my research
will be done.

369
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,303
Now completed, after failing
for 30 years.

370
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,840
I will make cherry blossoms
bloom in this country!

371
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,476
You mean you've
wasted 30 years

372
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,845
researching freakin
cherry blossoms.

373
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,514
That's what your big
project has been?

374
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,417
The same cherry blossoms you
think saved your life back

375
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,353
when you were a master thief?

376
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,320
[HIRILUK]
That's right.

377
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,456
[CHOPPER]
What?

378
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,092
Damn. You idiot.
This is a winter island

379
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,660
where it's bitter
cold year round,

380
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,129
no cherry blossom
will ever bloom here.

381
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,698
No! I was nothing but
a worthless criminal

382
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,000
on the very brink of death,

383
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,637
but those flowers saved my life
and transformed my existence.

384
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,173
Every human being in
this world can be saved.

385
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,209
And I'm going to prove
it right here in Drum,

386
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,378
the land where I was born!

387
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,147
Right. You do realize that
what you're saying

388
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,550
has no basis in medical science.
or any other field of science.

389
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:30,455
And if you do get them to bloom,
there's no medicinal use.

390
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,057
[KUREHA]
Hiriluk!

391
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,460
[KUREHA]
Hmph.

392
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:43,302
[HIRILUK] Chopper, you and I
are alike. So before I die,

393
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,504
I'll at least teach you
that nothing is impossible

394
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:49,908
in this world, and that you
can do anything if you try!

395
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,412
[KUREHA] However, the story
of these two outcasts

396
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,582
doesn't have a happy
fairy tale ending.

397
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,586
[HIRILUK] I'll show you...
the miraculous cherry blossoms!

Chopper again? He said no!

if there's a medicine

that can cure fools.
