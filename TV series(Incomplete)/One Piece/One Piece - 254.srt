1
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:20,153
That was close.

2
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:21,822
Thank you!

3
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,090
Look at that!

4
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:26,160
That huge fixture with the train
schedule on it was torn apart.

5
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,429
Nothing like that has
ever happened here before.

6
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,463
Not even with Aqua Laguna.

7
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,471
Really?

8
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,541
So after that, Sanji
went to the train station?

9
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,709
Yep!

10
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:44,144
At any rate, no matter how
we're going to follow them,

11
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:47,214
we can't do anything until
we find Luffy and Zoro first!

12
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,115
Understand?

13
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:48,549
Right!

14
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:49,750
I got it Nami.

15
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,585
You guys help look, too!

16
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,220
Let's do this!

17
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,355
Are you with me?

18
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,090
Yeah!

19
00:00:56,123 --> 00:01:00,694
Jerry Aurura Flicker!

20
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,198
Drop kick!

21
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,467
This is a waste of time.

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,368
Brochette!

23
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,607
Straw Hat, where are you?!

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,608
Answer us!

25
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,376
Please!

26
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,580
Come on, Granny!

27
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:21,181
Look! Look!

28
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,383
Hmm.

29
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,217
Hey!

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,551
Miss Pirate Lady!

31
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,286
Look!

32
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,420
Look over there!

33
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,289
I see something!

34
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,422
Like what?

35
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,766
Luffy!

36
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:43,270
That straw hat.

37
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,139
Isn't that your "King
of the Pirates" captain?

38
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,408
Well?

39
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,578
That idiot!

40
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,215
Hey, hold on!

41
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,584
Where do you think you're going?

42
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,518
Don't go down there!

43
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,253
It's dangerous!

44
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,821
Are you trying
to kill yourself?!

45
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,424
Aqua Laguna is gonna
hit at any moment!

46
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,158
Come back!

47
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,431
The pirate girl
went down the stairs!

48
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,099
What should we do?

49
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:12,833
Come back!

50
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,668
What if another wave hits?!

51
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:16,770
Wait!

52
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,605
It's gonna flood!

53
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,040
Don't follow her!

54
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,241
Paulie.

55
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,811
You running down there isn't
gonna do her a lick of good.

56
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:24,812
But--

57
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,181
You know how dangerous it is.

58
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,116
You'll drown, just like her.

59
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,418
If it gets bad, I'll
handle things, myself.

60
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,721
You can't win against the sea.

61
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,641
She jumped off the bridge!

62
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:04,784
Wow.

63
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:07,454
That lady sure makes me nervous.

64
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,523
Must be headed for Straw Hat.

65
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,157
This is insane.

66
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,123
I wouldn't have
the guts to do that.

67
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,725
She's either brave or stupid!

68
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,194
No, this is definitely stupid!

69
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:27,828
Hey!

70
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:28,729
Come back!

71
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:29,429
Quick!

72
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,665
The sea's gonna swallow you up!

73
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,700
A sea anemone.

74
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,339
A sea anemone?

75
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:43,276
Why is a sea anemone
coming out of a chimney?

76
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,314
Wait a second.

77
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:04,331
No, wait!

78
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,500
Not the reindeer, too!

79
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,668
Zoro!

80
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,521
As she said, Robin had a wish

81
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:31,091
that couldn't come true as
long as you were together.

82
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,293
She surrendered her life

83
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,696
to CP9 in order to
protect that very wish.

84
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,198
My wish is that all
of the Straw Hat Pirates

85
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,102
except me will be allowed
to leave this island safely.

86
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,370
If I can have that,

87
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,575
I'm willing to sacrifice myself
and everyone else in the world.

88
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,377
Robin, get off that train!

89
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,580
I don't care who you're up
against. We'll help you!

90
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,350
Robin!

91
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,815
You're awesome, Pirate Lady!

92
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,583
Don't be a fool, girl!

93
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,152
You won't make it back in time!

94
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,787
You can see for yourself!

95
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,756
The wave's gonna
hit any second now!

96
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,098
Oh man!

97
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,532
There's no turning back now!

98
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,401
They're as good as dead!

99
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,375
Zoro!

100
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:55,376
Hey!

101
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,378
You okay?

102
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,046
Can you hear me?

103
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,114
Chopper?

104
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,390
This is it.

105
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,725
I can't go any further.

106
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:54,201
Luffy!

107
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:03,944
You idiot!

108
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:07,147
What the hell are
you doing up there?!

109
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,050
Nami?

110
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,051
Where are you?

111
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,053
I can't see!

112
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,458
Okay, listen, listen,
it's not my fault.

113
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,060
That pigeon guy sent me
flying and I got stuck

114
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,529
between these buildings,
so I can't move.

115
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,698
I'm trying, though!

116
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,810
Is this a joke to you?!

117
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,612
We don't have time for this!

118
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,181
Those guys from the
government took Robin away

119
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:44,050
and you weren't
even there to help!

120
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,291
She did it all for us, you know!

121
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:53,126
She's going to
sacrifice herself!

122
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,045
The government was
planning on attacking us,

123
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:15,549
but Robin turned herself over
to CP9 so we would be safe!

124
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,151
There's no place
left in this world

125
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,353
for me to go, or return to.

126
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,688
I'm afraid you're wrong.

127
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:23,623
This is the last time
you'll ever see me.

128
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:28,795
She knew they would kill
her but she didn't care!

129
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:38,038
Then Robin was
lying this whole time?

130
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:47,113
I'm glad.

131
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,319
Don't worry!

132
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:59,059
I won't let Robin die!

133
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,527
Check out the
size of that thing!

134
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,461
Oh man!

135
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,098
The waves've never
been that big before!

136
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,367
Hey this is really bad, guys!

137
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,801
Run away, pirate lady!

138
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,336
You gotta get out of there!

139
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,204
You too, reindeer!

140
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,544
You're gonna tear me in half!

141
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,246
You're really stuck!

142
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,316
How'd you get in
there in the first place?!

143
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,683
Who cares?!

144
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,259
What do we do?

145
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,262
That wave's gonna
hit any second now!

146
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,365
How the hell should I know?

147
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,467
Ah Hold on that's funny.

148
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,535
Hey Chopper.

149
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,304
Are you carrying the Kintentsu?

150
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:43,771
Huh?

151
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:44,638
Your sword?

152
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,574
Yeah, I have one of them.

153
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:47,775
How on earth did you know that?

154
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:51,745
Well, I can tell with that
one at least since it's cursed.

155
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,815
Anyway, thanks
for carrying it for me.

156
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:55,616
Here, quick.

157
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,350
Put it in my hand.

158
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,286
Run away!

159
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:03,123
Get to higher ground! Hurry!

160
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,092
It's all over, they're
not gonna make it!

161
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,760
Pirate lady!

162
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,596
They'll get swept away for sure!

163
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,536
Aqua Laguna is here!

164
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,222
Oh no.

165
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:43,196
This is farewell.

166
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:16,363
I shoulda stayed at home.
This is too scary!

167
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,200
That wave's huge.

168
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,579
They're done for!

169
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,639
Whoa! That guy's
out of control!

170
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,473
He's knocking over buildings!

171
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:13,554
Zoro!

172
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,589
Stay back, Chopper!

173
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:20,560
One-Sword Style!
Thirty-Six Caliber Phoenix!

174
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,202
This is bad!

175
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,603
They're wrecking the town!

176
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:32,172
Nami!

177
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,240
Let's go!

178
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:39,413
Holy crap!

179
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:40,381
Rumble!

180
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:42,683
Jumping Point!

181
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,551
Just hold on to me!

182
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:54,761
They're washing away!

183
00:14:58,532 --> 00:14:59,699
Damn it.

184
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:12,446
Hey look!

185
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,348
They made it, I think!

186
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:31,365
Yay!

187
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,099
You did it!

188
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,070
They should be
safe on the bridge.

189
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,772
Yeah. It's a big wave,
but it's not that big!

190
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,541
You guys're amazing!

191
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:42,609
You gotta teach me that one!

192
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,502
Oh no, the tidal
wave's still coming!

193
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09,770
Did Straw Hat make it?

194
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:18,412
I don't know, man,
all I can see is water!

195
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,314
Look! Over there!

196
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:25,285
It's Paulie!

197
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,360
Crap.

198
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,215
Hurry!

199
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,283
We're not safe yet!

200
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,285
Run to shipbuilding island!

201
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,188
Run for it!

202
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,089
The bridge is done for!

203
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,523
I've never seen
anything like that.

204
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,659
The waves have never
made it this far before!

205
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:41,495
I thought we'd be safe here!

206
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:42,062
Look!

207
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,364
The tide's ebbing again.

208
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,398
Of course it is.

209
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,133
This is just the beginning.

210
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,334
There's gonna be
another wave like that

211
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,169
and another after that one!

212
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,471
If we wanna live, we gotta get

213
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:53,173
to higher ground
like everyone else.

214
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,119
You morons.

215
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,353
You're lucky you're alive.

216
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,221
Thanks.

217
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,589
You saved us, Rope Guy.

218
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:13,127
I didn't know Aqua Laguna
would be like that.

219
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,662
I can't stop shaking!

220
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,333
If it was that bad
every year, we'd be sunk.

221
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,669
I'm just as surprised
as you folks are.

222
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:23,370
This ain't normal at all.

223
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:26,373
You pirates are one
step shy of crazy!

224
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,409
You're lucky to
be alive right now.

225
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:28,943
Oh!

226
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:30,611
Hey, Monster Granny!

227
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:33,080
I didn't know you were here too!

228
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,548
Of course I am!

229
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:35,782
I may be drunk,

230
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:39,085
but I'd have to be stupid to
stay at sea during this storm!

231
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,722
You were awesome, Mister Pirate!

232
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:44,624
Your arms were
like "boing!" "boing!"

233
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:50,364
Yeah, I know.

234
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:51,598
I was gonna die!

235
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,436
Little turd put my
face in a death grip

236
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,470
then passed out like that.

237
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,342
Hey, Zoro what were
you doing down there

238
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,310
when the wave hit?

239
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:04,712
Couldn't you get away?

240
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:06,213
Oh, uh, yeah.

241
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,181
You know.

242
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:09,683
Zoro got stuck in a chimney.

243
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,522
You got stuck in a chimney?

244
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,660
Zoro, you dope!

245
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:21,562
I couldn't be that
lame if I tried!

246
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:24,298
Don't forget, you did
the same thing--twice!

247
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,300
You're both dopes, okay?!

248
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:30,503
Wait where's Sanji
and U-- Where's Sanji?

249
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:34,308
Oh yeah, there's a lot of
stuff I need to tell you.

250
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,809
You too, Zoro.

251
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,178
Hm?

252
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,619
Things are certainly
looking up for me!

253
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,623
Aokiji is a generous man.

254
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,825
Putting all those officers
and all those battleships

255
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,228
at the tip of my fingers.

256
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,330
Not that I haven't
earned it, though.

257
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,464
Under my fine leadership,

258
00:19:57,498 --> 00:20:02,302
CP9 has certainly accomplished
some excellent results.

259
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:07,441
Now aren't you happy
for your master, Funkfreed?

260
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,109
But no accolade is too great

261
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,312
for the team who
captured Nico Robin.

262
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:12,746
She's been a stain on the pride

263
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,249
of the government
for 20 years now.

264
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,251
And speaking of
stains, now that I know

265
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:19,787
that detestable
Cutty Flam is still alive,

266
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,123
I can have the satisfaction
of making him suffer.

267
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:25,259
Only two people
in this wide world

268
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,760
have the means
of reviving Pluton

269
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:30,297
and both of have been
nicely gathered together.

270
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,364
And let me tell you,

271
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,734
Funkfreed that train can't
get here quick enough.

272
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,371
Soon, I'll have enough power

273
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,674
to bring the whole
world to its knees!

274
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:01,428
And now...

275
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,466
...your prince on a white
horse is on his way, Robin!

276
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:06,733
Just you wait!

277
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:11,405
So let me get this straight.

278
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:14,742
You're saying Robin sacrificed
herself to protect us?

279
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,710
That's right.

280
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:21,081
The cook and Usopp are on
the train with her, huh?

281
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,617
Well, what should
we do, Captain?

282
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,057
Only one thing to do.

283
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:37,764
We set off and
rescue them right away!

284
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:43,603
I had a feeling you'd say that.

285
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:54,748
Let's go.

286
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,716
We're on our way, Robin!

287
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:14,161
Hey!

288
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:15,529
Let us borrow a ship!

289
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,097
A strong and fast one!

290
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:17,798
Not a chance.

291
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:18,665
Not in this storm.

292
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:20,601
I'd be sending you
to an early grave!

293
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:21,568
I don't care!

294
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:23,637
Our friends are out
there waiting for us!

295
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,473
Well, there is one way
to get through Aqua Laguna

296
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:29,310
if you're crazy
enough to try it.

297
00:23:29,343 --> 00:23:32,413
On the next One Piece:
"Another Sea Train?

298
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,381
Rocketman Charges Forth!"

299
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:37,150
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
