WEBVTT

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:37.582
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.487
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:45.732
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.303
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.543
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.446
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.952
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.791
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:02.966
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.502
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:08.510
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:12.885
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.259
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.292 --> 00:03:18.196
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.433
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.839
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:22.872 --> 00:03:25.612
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:28.651
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:28.684 --> 00:03:31.657
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.928
Amidst the chaos, he also
put prices on the heads

00:03:33.962 --> 00:03:38.036
of Luffy and his allies, turning
the entire kingdom against them.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.371
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:41.677
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:43.881
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:43.914 --> 00:03:47.087
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.824
[FUJITORA]
When all is said and done,

00:03:48.858 --> 00:03:53.033
the Navy and Doflamingo
are both unneeded here.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.738
We're birds of
a feather if you will.

00:03:55.772 --> 00:03:59.311
The Navy and I can never play
the hero for this kingdom.

00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:02.184
It's simply not our place.

00:04:02.217 --> 00:04:04.789
What if someone catches
on to your rational?

00:04:04.823 --> 00:04:06.025
[FUJITORA]
They won't.

00:04:06.058 --> 00:04:09.933
All they'll see is that I
hit a snag getting past you.

00:04:12.438 --> 00:04:14.241
Said like a true gambler.

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:18.115
[chuckles] Lady luck's
on my side.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.923
[TOWNSMAN P] King Riku! Please
tell us what we should do!

00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:25.063
[TOWNSMAN Q] If you propose we
fight, we shall take up arms!

00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:26.365
[TOWNSMAN R]
Please, King Riku!

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:29.338
[TOWNSMAN S]
We await your command!

00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:32.779
In that event,
I say we stay put.

00:04:32.812 --> 00:04:34.882
Huh? Why's that?

00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:39.192
If it's necessary, we can brace
ourselves for death later.

00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:41.129
[DOFLAMINGO]
Knowing what I'm capable of,

00:04:41.162 --> 00:04:43.701
did you really believe
you could beat me?

00:04:43.734 --> 00:04:45.437
The fact that you
wretched little brats

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.940
thought I was so weak,

00:04:46.973 --> 00:04:50.782
that I would fall to you and
your pathetic surprise attack.

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:51.817
Well, I find that to be

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.390
the highest form of
disrespect imaginable.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.764
You're so screwed.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.469
Let me tell you.

00:05:01.503 --> 00:05:05.711
I descend from the noblest
of bloodlines in the world.

00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:09.819
The Celestial Dragons!

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:14.028
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
Just the fact I exist

00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:15.998
makes me deserving
of admiration.

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:20.808
I possessed the rarest
of powers known to man.

00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:22.111
Hiya, Daddy!

00:05:22.144 --> 00:05:23.547
Where did all the slaves go?

00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:25.784
Hey! Let's buy some more!

00:05:25.818 --> 00:05:27.187
Um, Daddy?

00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:29.860
Why are they not
kneeling before me?

00:05:29.893 --> 00:05:33.601
Daddy, why? Everyone
is coming after us!

00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:35.771
[COMMONER A] They're a family
of Celestial Dragons!

00:05:35.805 --> 00:05:38.945
Don't kill 'em!
Let's make them suffer instead!

00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:44.989
[DOFLAMINGO chuckling]

00:05:47.094 --> 00:05:48.631
At the young age of ten,

00:05:48.664 --> 00:05:52.237
I experienced both Heaven
and Hell, firsthand.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.544
I took it upon myself
to end my suffering

00:05:55.578 --> 00:05:59.753
by bringing the head of my own
father back to Marie Jois!

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:03.761
But can you believe
that the Celestial Dragons

00:06:03.794 --> 00:06:06.298
would tell a ten-year-old boy
they wouldn't take back

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:08.770
someone from
a "line of traitors"?

00:06:08.804 --> 00:06:12.645
It was then that I found there
was no escaping this hell.

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:15.952
From that moment
forward I swore

00:06:15.985 --> 00:06:19.726
that I would destroy
everything they held dear.

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:24.001
To put it frankly,
every damn thing in this world.

00:06:30.581 --> 00:06:32.451
The lives you've
led cannot possibly

00:06:32.485 --> 00:06:36.125
be compared to what
I've been through.

00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:39.264
I'm not wasting my time

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:42.004
screwing around
with brats like you.

00:06:42.037 --> 00:06:44.141
It's below me!

00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:52.057
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

00:06:56.132 --> 00:06:57.568
[NARRATOR]
Primula.

00:06:57.602 --> 00:07:00.073
A district located in the
northwestern part of Dressrosa.

00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:07.053
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:13.099
[TOWNSMAN B]
No! P-P-Please don't hurt me!

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:14.001
Spare his life!

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:15.169
P-P-Put the sword down.

00:07:15.203 --> 00:07:18.544
I beg you! You don't
have to do this!

00:07:18.577 --> 00:07:21.215
[TOWNSWOMAN A]
Please, sir!

00:07:21.248 --> 00:07:22.417
I wanna stop!

00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:24.823
I really don't want
to do this. Run!

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:27.528
I can't-- I can't
control my body--

00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:30.534
It's moving on its own! Please.

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:33.072
Forgive me! I can't fight it!

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.014
[PIRATE A laughs]
With this much loot,

00:07:37.047 --> 00:07:40.053
we can rebuild our ship
no problem at all!

00:07:40.086 --> 00:07:41.523
Yeah deshi deshi.

00:07:41.556 --> 00:07:42.992
[MARINE A]
Dammit! Stop, right there!

00:07:43.026 --> 00:07:45.364
We don't have time to deal with
your pillaging right now!

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:46.366
[PIRATE C]
Crap. The Navy!

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.635
Deshi!

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:50.006
Don't just stand there,
you idiots. Let's go!

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:51.208
You can't escape!

00:07:51.241 --> 00:07:53.647
[PIRATE A laughs]
We already are!

00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:54.716
[MARINES]
Stop!

00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:56.586

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.824

Stick your head in doo doo!

00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:07.341

00:08:07.374 --> 00:08:09.679
[neighs]

00:08:09.712 --> 00:08:12.217
[MARINE D]
Fire the tranquilizers!

00:08:16.092 --> 00:08:18.564
[MARINE E]
Seems the animals are panicking.

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:21.101
Is it just the fire, or do they
sense something wrong?

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.207
How awful. And we're already
shorthanded on this island.

00:08:24.241 --> 00:08:26.746
[trumpets]

00:08:30.954 --> 00:08:33.493
[MARINE F] It's gonna
kill itself at this rate.

00:08:33.527 --> 00:08:36.098
Tranq it! We still have
some ammo, don't we?

00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:38.570
[elephant trumpets]

00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:41.208
[gunshots]

00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:42.845
[TOWNSMAN D]
What's going on?

00:08:42.878 --> 00:08:45.350
You people are from
the Navy, aren't you?

00:08:45.384 --> 00:08:46.819
Take responsibility!

00:08:46.853 --> 00:08:49.859
Surely you can do something
to fix this! It's your duty!

00:08:49.893 --> 00:08:53.567
[MAYNARD] Honestly.
What are you expecting of us?

00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:56.372
We're short on both on
tranquilizers and men.

00:08:56.405 --> 00:08:59.245
[groans] We've got
our hands tied.

00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:01.650
Vice Admiral Maynard!

00:09:01.683 --> 00:09:02.518
[MAYNARD]
What now?

00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:04.021
Sir, status report!

00:09:04.055 --> 00:09:07.027
It's concerning Sabo
and Admiral Issho!

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.031
The fight between them
ended in a draw!

00:09:09.065 --> 00:09:11.770
Don't joke around!
How's that possible?

00:09:11.803 --> 00:09:13.574
Our Admirals from
the Navy Headquarters

00:09:13.607 --> 00:09:16.846
are some of the best
combatants we have to offer!

00:09:18.216 --> 00:09:20.621
[MAYNARD]
Why not, Issho?

00:09:20.655 --> 00:09:24.294
Doflamingo is unfit
to be a Warlord!

00:09:24.328 --> 00:09:26.633
We have to stop him!

00:09:33.112 --> 00:09:34.482
We can't make that call.

00:09:34.516 --> 00:09:37.054
We've been doing it
like that too long.

00:09:37.087 --> 00:09:40.528
The same old song
and dance every time.

00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:42.898
You've been in the Navy
for quite a while,

00:09:42.932 --> 00:09:45.003
if I recall, Vice Admiral?

00:09:45.037 --> 00:09:45.971
Huh?

00:09:46.005 --> 00:09:47.641
[FUJITORA]
Don't tell you've never once

00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:50.112
opened your ears
this whole time?

00:09:50.146 --> 00:09:54.689
You hear those screams?
That's not fear. It's rage.

00:09:54.722 --> 00:09:58.530
No, those aren't the cries
of terrified folks.

00:09:58.563 --> 00:10:00.634
They're furious!

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:09.218
That's why the World Government
has no business playing God!

00:10:09.953 --> 00:10:12.725
[MAYNARD]
Something's not adding up here.

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:13.928
[MARINE G]
What should we do?

00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:15.330
[MAYNARD]
There's no time for this.

00:10:15.363 --> 00:10:17.201
I'll settle it later.

00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:19.739
Right now, we have to get
this chaos under control.

00:10:19.772 --> 00:10:22.110
We can round up all pirates
who went after Doflamingo

00:10:22.143 --> 00:10:25.083
once the kingdom is safe.
Do I make myself clear?

00:10:25.116 --> 00:10:26.218
[MARINES]
Sir!

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:29.257
[MAYNARD] Do not harm
any civilians or animals!

00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:33.232
Your orders are to sedate
anyone who is not in control.

00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:37.340
[MAYNARD] Sadly,
that's all we can do for now.

00:10:43.987 --> 00:10:46.326
[MAYNARD grunts]
How do we restore order?

00:10:46.359 --> 00:10:47.595
There's no end in sight.

00:10:47.628 --> 00:10:54.307
[cries] Daddy! Mommy!

00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:09.171
[KIDS crying]

00:11:09.204 --> 00:11:11.008
Are you kids okay?

00:11:23.734 --> 00:11:26.706
[LUFFY]
Dammit! I can't break it off.

00:11:26.739 --> 00:11:30.113
[chuckles] Yeah!
That's the point!

00:11:30.146 --> 00:11:31.114
[gasps]

00:11:36.325 --> 00:11:38.329
[chuckles]

00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:39.397
[LUFFY gasps]

00:11:42.237 --> 00:11:44.909
You gotta dodge me!

00:11:51.355 --> 00:11:53.627
[LUFFY] Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.967
[LUFFY grunting]

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.342
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum... Octopus Stamp!

00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:06.151
[LUFFY yelling]

00:12:09.324 --> 00:12:10.628
Almost had me.

00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:12.163
Behind you!

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:17.206
You can't even comprehend
the situation, can you?

00:12:19.278 --> 00:12:20.848
[DOFLAMINGO]
Let me put it this way.

00:12:20.881 --> 00:12:23.119
If people could harm
a Celestial Dragon,

00:12:23.152 --> 00:12:25.924
just imagine the
things they'd do.

00:12:44.227 --> 00:12:47.535
[DOFLAMINGO]
Humanity is cruel.

00:12:47.568 --> 00:12:50.741
Vicious by nature.

00:12:50.774 --> 00:12:54.014
What are you talking about,
you fake Mingo?

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.071
[DOFLAMINGO] All right. I think
it's about time we start

00:13:06.104 --> 00:13:08.577
rolling out those executions.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.881
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:13:10.914 --> 00:13:13.587
You're first on my list, Law.

00:13:13.621 --> 00:13:19.999
[laughs] Oh, hey! What if you
chopped him into bits and pieces

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:22.738
just like he did to me, Doffy?

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.647
[DOFLAMINGO] Saying "I'm
extremely disappointed in you"

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.550
is an understatement.

00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:30.821
[LAW] One thing still doesn't
make sense to me.

00:13:30.854 --> 00:13:32.290
[TREBOL]
Huh?

00:13:32.324 --> 00:13:36.198
As a former Celestial Dragon,
banished from Marie Jois,

00:13:36.231 --> 00:13:38.937
how do you still
wield their power?

00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:43.980
[LAW] CP-0 is working directly
under the World Government.

00:13:44.014 --> 00:13:46.586
But you called them
here this morning.

00:13:48.122 --> 00:13:51.429
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
That's your last request?

00:13:51.462 --> 00:13:55.036
You really wanna know
the dirty details?

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:56.606
It's because I know all about

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:59.612
a very important
national treasure.

00:13:59.645 --> 00:14:04.020
Something that's hidden within
the Holyland of Marie Jois.

00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:08.963
[LAW]
It gives you that much leverage?

00:14:08.997 --> 00:14:12.104
[DOFLAMINGO] Yes. You could
even say its very existence

00:14:12.137 --> 00:14:14.976
could shake humanity.

00:14:15.009 --> 00:14:18.048
[WORLD NOBLE A]
Get him! Kill Doflamingo!

00:14:18.082 --> 00:14:19.719
[WORLD NOBLE B]
That child must not be allowed

00:14:19.753 --> 00:14:22.156
to see another day!

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.061
To them I was
a ticking time bomb.

00:14:24.094 --> 00:14:27.301
An escapee with dirt that
could destroy their world.

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:29.773
But those cowards
became quite cooperative

00:14:29.806 --> 00:14:32.010
once they realized
they couldn't kill me--

00:14:32.044 --> 00:14:34.582
Though they did try.

00:14:34.616 --> 00:14:37.187
If only I had had the Op-Op
Fruit in my possession

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.357
at that crucial point in time.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.963
Things would have
played out a bit differently.

00:14:41.996 --> 00:14:43.867
I would have been
able to utilize

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.504
Marie Jois' national treasure

00:14:45.537 --> 00:14:49.043
and seize the world
by the neck that day!

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:53.787
[DOFLAMINGO] That should
show you just how valuable

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.860
your fruit actually is.

00:14:56.893 --> 00:14:59.999
Aside from "Personality
Transplant Surgery,"

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:01.435
there's another use.

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:04.474
Are you even aware
of that fact, Law?

00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:08.215
In the right hands,
the Op-Op Fruit has the power

00:15:08.249 --> 00:15:13.025
to make mankind's oldest, most
sought-after dream a reality.

00:15:13.058 --> 00:15:15.030
That's why you will
hear many refer to it as

00:15:15.063 --> 00:15:17.935
the "Ultimate Devil Fruit."

00:15:18.903 --> 00:15:20.607
[LAW]
Yeah, I know.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.747
I have no interest in
using it for that though.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.352
The great mystery of the
fruit is its ability known as

00:15:26.385 --> 00:15:29.592
the "Perpetual
Youth Surgery," right?

00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:33.432
It grants eternal life.

00:15:52.303 --> 00:15:54.340

And yet, by performing it,

00:16:03.961 --> 00:16:07.835
the surgeon sacrifices
their own in exchange.

00:16:07.869 --> 00:16:09.706

Bingo!

That's why I had no intentions
of letting you eat it.

But you repaid my
kindness with betrayal!

00:16:15.216 --> 00:16:18.455

apologize for that one.
