00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.332
they sealed off
the entire island.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:42.768
Surely no one's there anymore!

00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:44.336
Maybe they're not.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.808
Frankly, I can't imagine anyone
surviving in that living hell.

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:51.410
But we're screwed
if we're wrong.

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:55.081
Change course immediately, men.
We're off to Punk Hazard.

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:57.416
Huh? You sure, Vice Admiral?

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.486
That place is off-limits,
even for folks like us!

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:03.289
You don't get to lecture me
while burning a man alive!

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:04.657
Come on!

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.326
[MARINES]
Yes, sir.

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:19.438
So? How many of us
are going to the island?

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:21.173
Since we don't know
what the hell's going on,

00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:24.276
we should probably keep
a few people on the ship.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.445
Hey, Franky.
I need the Mini-Merry.

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:27.346
No prob.

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:29.782
Are you nuts?
You are not going alone!

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:31.450
If you wanna come, just say so.

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:34.220
Not a chance! If we let
you run off unsupervised,

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.122
it could take us days
to hunt you down!

00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:37.223
Huh?

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:38.390
Too bad.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:40.626
Captain Bellywarmer here
would only get him more lost.

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:43.229
Hey, don't call me that!
Or I will cut you!

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:44.263
[SANJI growls]

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:47.833
I'm game! Let's do this thing!

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:49.201
Yes, count me in, too.

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:50.469
[ALL]
Huh?

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:52.471
Well, looks like a rock
solid team to me--

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:54.573
No need for any of us to go!

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.809
I had a feeling it
would come to this.

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.310
We'll draw straws.

00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:00.312
Now, no one can complain.

00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:01.514
I'm going anyway.

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:03.215
You think a straw's
gonna stop me?

00:13:03.249 --> 00:13:06.952
Hey! If I get picked,
you go instead!

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:11.423
I'll summon all the
good luck I've got left!

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:13.692
What's good is it gonna
do me if I die right here?

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:15.327
It's time to bet it all!

00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:19.365
[yells]

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:30.776
[gasps]

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.078
That settles it, then.
Just don't die.

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:34.446
Yeah, you wish.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.048
[ROBIN chuckles]
This should be fun!

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:37.550
[USOPP]
Or fatal.

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.718
You won? Good job, Usopp.

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:41.020
You wanna go?

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:46.392
Trade with me! Please! [sobs]

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:06.545
Take this. It's a
giant shellfish lunchbox.

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:10.850
Woohoo! Yeah, I can't wait!

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:13.619
[NAMI]
Milky Road! Let's go!

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:16.956
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:21.994
That's cool!

00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:23.729
You sure showed
that wall of fire!

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:26.899
You can make 'em just like
they do in Skypeia now, huh?

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:28.167
Uh-huh!

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.936
We still have to wait a minute
before they stabilize, though.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.471
[LUFFY]
Okay!

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.947
[LUFFY] All right!
Time for adventure, you guys!

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.749
Come on, Mini-Merry!

00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:46.719
Be careful! Please don't die!

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:48.721
Wish I could go,
you lucky punks!

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:50.756
They'll probably need
our help soon enough.

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:53.092
[BROOK laughs]
Watch out for lava!

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:54.760
Usopp, be brave!

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:58.464
Someone trade with me!

00:14:58.497 --> 00:15:00.466
[LUFFY]
Whoa, this shellfish is great!

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:03.302
[USOPP] Don't tell me you're
eating your lunch already!

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.107
[LUFFY]
Hm? Ooh, look over the edge!

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.943
It's fire! Fire! This is fun!

00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:12.778
Usopp, you're scared
over nothing!

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:15.781
Will these clouds still be here
when we need to come back?

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:17.917
Hey and it stopped raining, too!

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.485
Island scouting weather!

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:21.587
No, it's not!

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:26.492
[BROOK] Nami, are you certain
that cloud bridge of yours

00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:27.960
reaches the island?

00:15:27.993 --> 00:15:29.728
[NAMI]
I have no idea.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.797
But Luffy will figure
something out, I'm sure.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.800
[BROOK gasps]
Easy for you to say!

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:38.103
[CHOPPER sighs]
I couldn't have handled that.

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:41.573
Not with all my fur.
I'm hot enough already!

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:43.475
[NAMI]
I'll bet this'll work out fine!

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:44.710
Robin's there.

00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:47.513
We just needed one person on
the team to keep Luffy in line.

00:15:47.546 --> 00:15:50.082
Sounds like you cooked up
a whole formula for this.

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:51.750
[SANJI]
You're so considerate, Nami!

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:55.421
Let me make a dessert for you!
Maybe something nice and cool?

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:56.956
[FRANKY, BROOK]
Yay! Dessert!

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:59.191
[SANJI]
It's not for you!

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:01.193
--[FRANKY] Aw!
--[BROOK] Please?

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:05.197
Look! I see the
entrance to the island!

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.865
They've got a gate
and everything!

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:08.367
Wonder if there's a town?

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.568
Not likely!

00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:12.271
Whoever lived here before
probably got burned to a crisp!

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.673
If there was a town,
then it would be on fire!

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:17.209
Wherever that call came from,
it must have been far away,

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:19.378
safe from all of this mess!

00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:21.013
Robin, back me up!

00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:23.849
I was skeptical at first,
but the flavor is great!

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:26.285
Why is everyone eating
their lunch right now?

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:28.220
You're not? I'll eat it for you.

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:30.356
I'm saving it for later!

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:31.957
[ROBIN]
Do want this piece, Luffy?

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.359
[LUFFY]
Yeah!

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:34.393
[ROBIN]
Here.

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:38.864
Sanji outdid himself!

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:41.700
We're lucky! There's
lots of shellfish left!

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:42.901
[USOPP gasps]

00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:47.506
My disease is coming back!
I can feel it inside of me!

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:48.841
So, here's the thing.

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:50.809
I've got "can't go on
this island" disease

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:52.011
and it's terminal!

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:53.012
I know.

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:54.046
I know.

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:55.681
I know.

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:57.716
My brain is melting!

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.519
My heart is seizing up--
I think I'm gonna die!

00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:01.653
[LUFFY laughs]

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.555
[USOPP]
Turn the ship around!

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.765
[ROBIN]
Well, that settles it.

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:14.333
This is where the
call came from.

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:17.703
[USOPP] Yeah, he said
"Punk Hazard" for sure.

00:17:17.736 --> 00:17:18.637
[BOTH grunt]

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.241
Get Mini-Merry away
from all that fire.

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:23.609
[ZORO]
So this is the right island,

00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:26.345
but that distress call could've
come from anywhere.

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:29.848
How curious. Seems the
island is off-limits.

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:31.917
Yeah! Luffy! See that?

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:32.951
[LUFFY, ZORO]
Hm?

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:37.089
[LUFFY]
Yeah? So? I love danger.

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:39.258
[USOPP] Not that!
The World Government mark!

00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:41.427
They're running this place!

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.929
So whoever it was that
called for help was a Marine!

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:45.230
It's obviously a trap!

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:47.066
I guess we're
done here, right guys?

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:48.600
[USOPP gasps]

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:57.342
Uh, hey. We are leaving,
aren't we? Zoro.

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:07.486
Well, that was easy!

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:08.921
[ROBIN chuckles]

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:18.097
[groans] It's hot!

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.099
[ZORO groans]

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:22.301
Hey, stop! Trespassing
is a crime!

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:24.069
Are you sure you wanna do this?

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.170
Oh, wait.

00:18:25.204 --> 00:18:28.240
Yeah, I guess we're already
criminals, aren't we?

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:29.475
But the Government!

00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:32.144
You don't wanna pick
a fight with them, do you?

00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:33.946
Wait, we've done that, too.

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:38.951
[USOPP gasps] Okay, but from
a morality standpoint!

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:44.490
[LUFFY groans] This is stupid.
Why is it so hot?

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:47.426
I'm thinking because
everything is on fire.

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:48.927
[ROBIN] I doubt it's
always been this way,

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.763
since the Government
built a fence here.

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:55.134
Something happened. But what?

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:57.302
[gasps]

00:18:57.336 --> 00:18:59.471
[USOPP]
Hold on! Don't leave me!

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:13.318
Scary! I coulda used
some help back there!

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:19.491
[USOPP panting]

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:24.596
[ROBIN] It's not so bad.
Those aren't houses.

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:26.798
[ROBIN]
Clearly, they're some sort of

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:29.001
government research facilities.

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.804
So you think the volcano
or something did this?

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:35.507
And then, what, they shut
the whole operation down?

00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:38.744
Or do you think they were up to
something and they did this?

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:42.414
The fact that the Log Pose
didn't point to this island

00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:44.983
troubles me,
but what does that mean?

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:50.689
Hey! Did that samurai kill you?

00:19:50.722 --> 00:19:53.926
If you're not dead yet, say so!

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:02.534
[LUFFY]
Hey! Samurai!

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:04.670
You wanna fight?

00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:06.939
He's a killer!
He'll kill us, too!

00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:08.440
Now you have an appetite?

00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:10.809
This is stress-eating,
thank you!

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:17.683
There's something else
about this that's fishy.

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:19.251
The guy making
the emergency call

00:20:19.284 --> 00:20:21.420
said it was cold, didn't he?

00:20:21.453 --> 00:20:24.890
[RANDOM MAN 579A]
Please. It's cold. We need Boss!

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:26.191
Yeah, he did.

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:29.094
But how can you be
cold and on fire?

00:20:29.127 --> 00:20:30.896
Maybe he's stupid.

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:32.598
I doubt that's the issue here.

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:35.801
Can there be a cold place
on a burning island?

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:36.868
Or perhaps he was cold

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:39.037
simply because he was
bleeding to death.

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:42.174
Robin, could you keep
those thoughts to yourself?

00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:46.945
[rumbling, growling]

00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:53.852
[USOPP] What was that?
Why are there scary noises?

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.689
What the heck?

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:04.229
[CHOPPER] Thanks, Sanji!
It's real yummy!

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:08.000
And all we had to do
was beg and cry!

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:10.102
This is nice and cold, too!

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:13.305
Ow, I got brain freeze!

00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:15.307
Or should I call it
"soul freeze"?

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.308
Be grateful!

00:21:16.341 --> 00:21:18.810
You're lucky Nami's
sharing her leftovers!

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:19.911
They weren't for you!

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:23.515
Oh, but I could make seconds
if you want some more.

00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:25.951
What's up? You notice something?

00:21:27.152 --> 00:21:29.921
Yeah. The clouds.

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:31.590
[ALL]
Huh?

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:33.425
[NAMI] The sky on the
far side of the island

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:35.360
is different than
the sky on our side.

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:38.697
Almost like the weather is the
complete opposite over there.

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:42.701
Not our problem, I guess!

00:21:42.734 --> 00:21:44.202
Hmm.

00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:50.175
[gasps] It's a giant?

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:54.313
Nuh-uh. It's way
bigger than that.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.253
Do you think that's what's
causing all this wind?

00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:05.457
[LUFFY gasps]

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.592
It's behind us. Huh?

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.898
My goodness.

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:16.234
[gasping]

00:22:20.238 --> 00:22:22.874
[screams]

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:27.512
Oh, wow. Those things
are real? Crazy!

00:22:27.546 --> 00:22:29.014
No way.

00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:31.383
Whatever this is,
it must be a trick.

00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:33.352
Those things're
only in fairy tales.

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:36.321
And yet, just look at it.

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:38.623
What else could it possibly be?

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:56.708
[DRAGON 579A roars]

00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:05.250
[ALL]
A dragon?

00:23:05.283 --> 00:23:08.587
[DRAGON 579A growls]

00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:19.431
[NARRATOR] Dragons are thought
to exist only in legends,

00:23:19.464 --> 00:23:21.967
but the Straw Hats find
themselves face to face

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.769
with this firebreathing beast.

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:27.105
Luffy and Zoro struggle against
its overwhelming strength,

00:23:27.139 --> 00:23:29.241
determined to stop the
creature from destroying

00:23:29.274 --> 00:23:30.475
everything in sight.

00:23:30.509 --> 00:23:32.244
But the crew is left
even more stunned

00:23:32.277 --> 00:23:34.312
when the dragon begins to speak.

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:36.114
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:36.148 --> 00:23:40.118
"A Battle in the Heat!
Luffy Vs. the Giant Dragon!"

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:42.921
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
