[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power...

00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,506
Gold Roger, the King
of the Pirates,

3
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:09,342
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:12,712
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,448
You can have it.

7
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,785
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,254
Now, you just have to find it.

9
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,692
[NARRATOR] These words
lured men to the Grand Line

10
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:26,793
in pursuit of dreams greater

11
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,728
than they've ever
dared to imagine!

00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,631

[ZORO] Even if this wound
would kill a normal man,

32
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,497
I am not allowed to fail.

33
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,632

New Year's Open!

Dragon Twister!

35
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:30,550
[ZORO] I think it's
time to go rescue Luffy.

36
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,754
Hahahahaha!

37
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,894
[NOJIKO] Sorry but this is
the best I can do for you.

38
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,764
[SANJI]
I see.

39
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,366
They couldn't move the stone

40
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,502
so they just moved
Luffy's head above the water.

41
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,709
[ARLONG] Hahahahaha!
This is more like it.

42
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,781

Ha! It's that old man
from the village...

45
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,914
What a waste of time.

46
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,317
[GENZO]
Dammit! He sees me.

47
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,451
Such a pathetic attempt

48
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,287
at trying to keep
rubber‐boy alive!

49
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,456
Guess I'll just kill you too!

50
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,595
[SANJI]
Where do you think you're going?

51
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,398
You... foolish human! Hya!

52
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,603
[KUROOBI] Are you really
trying to fight me under water?

53
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,571
You can't even
breathe down here.

54
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,740
What makes you
think you can fight?

55
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,477

As you wish, foolish boy...

[KUROOBI]
Too bad...

58
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,459
Your kick is
powerless down here.

59
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,961
That's more of
your human weakness.

60
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:27,333
But my Fishman Karate loses
nothing in water. Hahahaha!

61
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,670
Quite the contrary,
it's much more powerful.

62
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,775
[KUROOBI]
Fishman Karate!

63
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,343

...Palm Bomb!

70
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,431
Hmph!

71
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,104
[SANJI] Air! Air!
Air...! I let out too much!

72
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,074
I can't breathe...
Suffocating...

73
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,748
[KUROOBI]
Impressive.

74
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,450
[SANJI]
Crap! Let me through.

75
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,419
I need to breathe. Move it!

76
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,722
You have amazing stamina...

77
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,924
You sure you're human?

78
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,760
[SANJI]
Le me through now!

79
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,966
[laughs]

80
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,912
[KUROOBI]
Didn't you say something like,

81
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:24,217
any man who hurts a
lady is just a piece of crap.

82
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,052
And yet...

83
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,989
Look at what your precious love
of women has gotten you.

84
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,926
[KUROOBI]
You have no escape

85
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,062
and you'll die by my hand.

86
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,765
The old man and the
boy he's trying to save,

87
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,099
they'll die too.

88
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,769
I'll kill Zoro and
the long‐nosed guy.

89
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,104
Then I'll massacre
the entire village!

90
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,906
And as my final pleasure,

91
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,942
I'll murder that
traitorous bitch, Nami!

92
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,479
Don't you see?

93
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,114
You're "love" is worthless.

94
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,849
If it can't save you,

95
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,618
then you protect...

96
00:06:58,651 --> 00:06:59,685
...no one!

97
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:05,691
Not even your little girlfriend
Nami! Hahahahaha!

98
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,965
I'll admit that
you have some skills...

99
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,634
...but still...

100
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,270
...in the end
you're just a human.

101
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,773
Your body doesn't react well

102
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:24,710
to a sudden change
in pressure, does it?

103
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,312
Let's see...

104
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:30,149
I have a theory about
what's gonna happen to you...

105
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,719
Your organs are going
to explode from the inside out.

106
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,557
Pulverizing...

107
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,725
...Pressure Plunge!

108
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,734
Hahahaha!

109
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,237
[SANJI]
I can't let him do this!

110
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,705
If I want to save Nami,

111
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:56,042
the first thing I have
to do is save myself!

112
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,885
[chuckles]

113
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,653
Huh?

114
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,890
What's with him?

115
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,859
He just won't die!

116
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:19,098
[KUROOBI] Very well, I guess
we'll just have to try it again!

117
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,602
[SANJI] Fishmen use
lungs to breathe air on land.

118
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,606
But they use their gills to
breathe water down here,

119
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,878
which means a fish's gills
are useless on dry land.

120
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,681
Ready for your second go round?

121
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:39,285
[SANJI] And there lungs
are useless underwater...

122
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,786
...which means forcing air

123
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,056
into his gills should
suffocate this bastard.

124
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,367
Hmm?

125
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,637
You...

126
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:01,607
Is he...?

127
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,110
[SANJI]
Don't worry. He's okay.

128
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,244
Are you sure?

129
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,245
[SANJI]
Half of him.

130
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,246
Wait, half?

131
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,649
[SANJI]
I'll explain later.

132
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,885
First... Get your
ass up here...!

133
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,154
I want to fight
where I can breathe.

134
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,726
[KUROOBI]
You still don't get it, do you?

135
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,763
It doesn't matter to me if
I'm on land or in the water.

136
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,265
I am just as strong either way.

137
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:32,104
Now you will witness the
true power of Fishman Karate...

138
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,339
When I punched you before,

139
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,309
that was just a sample
of things to come.

140
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:40,446
My ultimate attack,
is ten times as powerful

141
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,915
and the chances
you'll survive it...

142
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:47,119
...are zero!!

143
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,288
Your neck!

144
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,760
You said my love was worthless?

145
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,297
Shoulder!

146
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,267
I can't protect anyone,
is that right?

147
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:07,807
Ribs! Back! Chest! Legs!

148
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:19,151
Son of a bitch...!
Thousand Brick Fist!

149
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,392
And now... Face Shot!

150
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:53,019
Now it's done...
He won't be back.

151
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,711
[GENZO]
What was that?

152
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,380
What's happening up there?

153
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,369
Kuroobi...

154
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,207
Hachi...

155
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,077
[SANJI] In the end
they're all just seafood.

156
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,112
A fish can't fight a cook.

157
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,381
I don't know what
he was thinking.

158
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,652
This game is ours.

159
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,956
[ARLONG]
You bastards...!

160
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,959
You've killed my brothers
one after the other.

161
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:11,063
I'm afraid I've let you
get too carried away!

162
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,402
[ZORO]
All right explain.

163
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:17,903
Luffy's half okay...

164
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,105
What does that mean?

165
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,308
It means he's alive
for the time being...

166
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,910
but if we want him
fully back on dry land,

167
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,313
I've got to go
back in the water.

168
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,150
[SANJI] But something tells me
ugly over there won't let me.

169
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,656
Amazing... really amazing...

170
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,260
Those guys ... beat two
of Arlong's best fishmen.

171
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,667
I'm done...
I can't hold my breath.

172
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,103
[NOJIKO]
Take my place. I'll go.

173
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,173
[GENZO] He's looking better.
Not so pale.

174
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,008
[NOJIKO]
He spit out a bunch of water.

175
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,276
Did I miss anything?

176
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,879
They're doing great.
Everyone's fine.

177
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,447
For the first time...

178
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,382
...I think I have hope...

179
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,452
These guys have fought so well.

180
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,789
We may actually be set free!

181
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,703
Choo. What a pain in the ass!

182
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,841
That long nose freak
sure could run forever.

183
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,209
But it took just one blast

184
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:34,246
from my squirt gun to
take him out completely.

185
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,750
[CHOO]
I guess I should head back.

186
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,186
It's all over by now, for sure.

187
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,074
[USOPP]
It worked! I'm alive!

188
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:07,046
I am so glad I made the
Ketchup Star for such occasions.

189
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,248
He thinks he killed me
with a water blast.

190
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,017
Run along now! Go home!

191
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,955
[USOPP] These guys
are totally freakin' nuts.

192
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,891
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

193
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,897
[USOPP]
They destroyed an entire village

194
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,098
and killed everyone in it.

195
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:30,102
I know Nami can't do this
all on her own but seriously...

196
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,375
I'm hearing things.

197
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,544
[USOPP]
I don't mind hiding from death.

198
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,479
Death is scary.

199
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,781
[USOPP] Let's see.
I'm covered in fake blood

200
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,483
but I need to look
a little more beat up

201
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,385
like I fought bravely.

202
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,389
[USOPP]
Hey I know what's missing.

203
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,125
Dirt. Yeah, I'm too clean.

204
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,929
Hey... "I'm sorry, I got lost."

205
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,265
Yeah, that's good.

206
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:03,435
No. "I did my best,
but he got me." Maybe.

207
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,405
"I was this close to the
bastard, and he got away."

208
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,173
That sounds better. Nah.

209
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,509
Sounds like I'm trying too hard.

210
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,345
[LUFFY] We're friends...
Right...? So get on.

211
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,915
How 'bout... "Don't cry Nami.

212
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,584
We all did the
very best we could."

213
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,587
[ZORO] Never in my life
did I imagine I'd lose.

214
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,357
Or... "Everybody
fought very bravely."

215
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,325
[SANJI]
But the truth...

216
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,460
...is that our idiot
Captain is far better

217
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,463
than a gang who'd
prey on a lady.

218
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,600
[USOPP]
Maybe... "I nearly died myself."

219
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,202
[NAMI]
It's for my business.

220
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,471
This was my only choice.

221
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,840
"Nami... No,

222
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,344
to tell the truth, my injuries
aren't bad at all, really."

223
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,446
[JOHNNY]
Big Sis Nami was crying.

224
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,281
[YOSAKU]
Do they need any more reason

225
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,216
than that to put
their lives on the line?

226
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,852
[NOJIKO] To make a choice
like that when you're only ten.

227
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,822
Do you know how hard that
must have been for Nami?

228
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,968
I fought... bravely...

229
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,305
I never quit... Yeah... that's‐‐

230
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,410
[USOPP]
I'm just...

231
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,045
...a liar!

232
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,021
I'm nothing but a coward!

233
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,157
Stop right there,
you son of a bitch!

234
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:39,365
[CHOO]
Oh...? You're still alive. Choo.

235
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,200
That's right, Big Lips...!

236
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,169
It takes more than water
to kill someone like me!

237
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,671
Choo.

238
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:52,578
[USOPP] When I left
home, I left everything behind.

239
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,080
Peace... Safety...

240
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,916
[USOPP] When you live
your life on the edge,

241
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,451
you savor every moment.

242
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,454
That's why they're
able to laugh so much!

243
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,058
[USOPP]
That's the reason I went to sea.

244
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,594
I want to laugh that way too.

245
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,563
[USOPP] And if I don't
fight with all I've got,

246
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,533
then I don't deserve to be on
the same ship with them.

247
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,470
And I will never be able
to face my friends again!

248
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:34,920
Fool... You were better
off pretending to be dead.

249
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,090
The human brain is
an absolute waste of meat.

250
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,625
Choo

251
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:44,163
I... don't feel good.

252
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,966
[CHOO] Oh, yeah...
I'm just getting started.

253
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,968
[USOPP]
Stop it.

254
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:53,105
Usopp Hammer!

255
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,141
Usopp Rubberband of Doom!

256
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,814
Choo. Arrrgh!

257
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,817
Crap...! Where'd that
stupid son of a bitch go?!

258
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,756
I can't believe this!

259
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,991
[USOPP]
Special Attack!

260
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:14,660
[CHOO]
Saké?

261
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,295
[USOPP]
Lead Star!

262
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,266
[CHOO] Is this the only way
you can fight, you coward!

263
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,203
There is no place to hide
from my squirt cannon.

264
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,845
[USOPP]
Stupid, coward or whatever.

265
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,847
I can't run from this fight...

266
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,548
I'm supposed to be a man...

267
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,018
Although it doesn't really feel
all that great to be manly.

268
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,855
If I lose, I'll die.

269
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,957
At least I'll die a pirate.

270
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,692
Squirt Cannon!!!

271
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,637
Ohhh!!
No way...! This sucks!

272
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,405
Damn it.

273
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,342
Why should I have to waste
my time with such an idiot?

274
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,178
[CHOO]
It's too easy.

275
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,014
I'll shred you to pieces...

276
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,016
[CHOO]
Squirt Machine Gun!

277
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,220
How did he find me?

278
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,755
Crap! Crap! Holy Crap!

279
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,023
I wanted to be a real pirate

280
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,758
and now that I've
finally gotten my chance.

281
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,361
I know I can do it.
I know I can...

282
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,662
I promise...

283
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,030
If I survive this ordeal,

284
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:28,200
I'll never pretend to
be a pirate ever again!

285
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,869
I won't be a coward
and run away!

286
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,738
My fake pirate days...

287
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,239
...are over!!

288
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,911
What did you say is done?

289
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,112
This whole fight...

290
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,247
Alcohol lights on fire.

291
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,750
Usopp Flaming Star!

292
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:49,254
[CHOO]
Aaahhh!

293
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,757
Hot, fire, hot, hot!

294
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,192
[CHOO]
Water! Must find water!

295
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,193
Water! Water, water!

296
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,027
[USOPP]
Wait a minute!

297
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,930
[CHOO]
Water, water, water, water!

298
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,767
[USOPP]
Usopp Hammer!!

299
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,368
Choo!

300
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:24,923
[CHOO]
Bastard!

301
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,794
[USOPP] Usopp Hammer!
Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer!

302
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,296
Usopp Hammer!
Rubberband of Doom!

303
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,898
Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer!

304
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:36,168
Usopp Hammer! Usopp Hammer!
Usopp Hammer!

305
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,970
Usopp Hammer!

306
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,915
[USOPP]
I did it! I beat... a fishman...

307
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,817
You see that, loser!!

308
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,819
I beat your ass!!

309
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,492
I can't believe
I actually did it...!

310
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:06,164
Who's a pirate now...?!
I am Usopp the Pirate!!!

311
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,433
Hahahaha!

312
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,146
[GENZO]
Please breathe!

313
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,320
You need to come back
now before it's too late...

314
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,122
...for your friends.

315
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,964
[DOCTOR]
I must have been dreaming.

316
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:42,968
For a moment there, I thought
we actually had a chance.

317
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,204
Uh... So what did
that shark guy just do?

318
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,539
I don't know.

319
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,375
It looked like he was just
throwing water around...

320
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,812
...but then they both
started to bleed.

321
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,381
I don't even
have to touch you...

322
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,184
You humans are so
fragile that I can kill you

323
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,220
just by playing around
with a little water...

324
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,856
That's the difference
between you and me.

325
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,191
Shut up!

326
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,032
[SANJI]
He's not kidding.

327
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:26,111
[SANJI] That's why the shark
is king of the fishmen.

328
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,916
[SANJI]
He's on a whole different level.

329
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,018
[ARLONG]
You should just die.

330
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,253
Your lives are
not worth that much...

331
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,856
There's no one who will
miss you when you're gone?

332
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,224
Arlong!

333
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,393
[JOHNNY and YOSAKU]
It's Nami!

334
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,128
[SANJI]
You're here...

335
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,431
[ARLONG]
Hey, Nami... I was just teaching

336
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:50,435
one final lesson to these
pathetic little pirates.

337
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,938
What are you doing here?

338
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,112
I'm here... to kill you.

339
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,119
<i>♪All that's in my heart</i>

340
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,121

<i>As I face what I must do</i>

342
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,959

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,612
<i>I began to wonder</i>

349
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:38,483
<i>What could be the reason</i>
<i>It's so hot inside</i>

350
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,986
<i>No answer has come</i>

351
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:45,023
<i>But I can't get away</i>
<i>from what's true</i>

352
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,961
<i>It's because of you</i>

353
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,164
<i>Show me how to</i>
<i>catch those feelings</i>

354
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,633
<i>Get 'em to come back to me</i>

355
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,334
<i>I'll do what I must</i>

356
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,538
<i>Because they're</i>
<i>everything I wanna be</i>

357
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,873
<i>Wrap these arms around my dreams</i>

358
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,376
<i>And pull 'em back from yesterday</i>

359
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,878
<i>If I'm holding hands with you</i>

360
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,514
<i>I'm sure that we can</i>
<i>make the way♪</i>

361
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,524
[ZORO]
I'll hold onto the fishman.

362
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,292
You go in the sea.

363
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,527
[SANJI]
Yeah! Leave Luffy to me!

364
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,230
[USOPP]
All right! I've got your back!

365
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,299
[ZORO] Hey! Aren't you
kinda far away for that?

366
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:28,366
[USOPP]
Ahh...

367
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,368
Well,,. I've got this thing
about fighting Arlong...

368
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,136
[ZORO]
Of course you do.

369
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,372
[LUFFY laughs]
Ahh! I'm saved!

370
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,041
On the next One Piece!

371
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,542
"Luffy at Full Power!

372
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,245
Nami's determination
and the Straw Hat!"

373
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,414
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
