00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:37.548
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:40.454
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.487 --> 00:02:45.598
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.003
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.409
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:53.313
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.819
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:58.591
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:02.899
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:04.401
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:08.544
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:12.919
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.300
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors,

00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:22.337
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law,

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:26.479
intending to destroy a Devil
Fruit Factory in Dressrosa.

00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:29.485
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.357
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:34.562
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:36.800
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:39.038
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:41.977
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:43.915 --> 00:03:46.085
Gum-Gum...

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:50.093
Go ahead. You'll die
just like Law!

00:03:50.127 --> 00:03:51.696
[LAW]
Shambles!

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:53.834
[DOFLAMINGO gasps]

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.911
Sorry, but nobody's
dying here except you!

00:04:01.048 --> 00:04:05.992
This operation will destroy
your body from the inside out!

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:08.130
[groans]

00:04:08.163 --> 00:04:09.732
Gamma Knife!

00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:18.016
[DOFLAMINGO yells]

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.287
Doffy! You're a king!

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.028
A king never falls to his knees!

00:04:24.062 --> 00:04:26.465
You forget about me?

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.674
Now Gum-Gum Jet Stamp!

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:33.948
Oh no!

00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:36.620
[groans]

00:04:39.024 --> 00:04:43.967
It has be... me who does this.

00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:48.677
[LAW]
Room!

00:04:53.086 --> 00:04:58.362
[LAW] Cora, I can finally
make your dream come true.

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:03.072
[LAW]
It's over, Doflamingo!

00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:22.945
[DOFLAMINGO panting]

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.920
[LAW] It's only a matter
of time before you die now.

00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:28.590
There's no visible wound,

00:05:28.624 --> 00:05:32.063
but the Gamma Knife
destroys your internal organs.

00:05:37.975 --> 00:05:41.816
You can take my word for it,
'cause I'm a doctor.

00:05:44.723 --> 00:05:50.968
[TREBOL gasps]
Law! What have you done?

00:05:51.002 --> 00:05:54.976
You'll pay! How dare you!

00:05:56.478 --> 00:05:59.084
[TREBOL groans]

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:04.996
Don't get in our way!

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:14.583
[LAW panting]

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.156
[LAW] Your "Family"
is nothing more than

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:20.528
people you thought
you could use.

00:06:20.561 --> 00:06:24.802
A bond built entirely on
your own ego and convenience.

00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:27.474
[LAW]
And your only true brother,

00:06:27.508 --> 00:06:30.380
who tried to stop you on
your path to destruction,

00:06:30.414 --> 00:06:32.752
was murdered by you.

00:06:33.687 --> 00:06:36.893
'Cause Law's finally free now!

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:51.857
[DOFLAMINGO] Yeah, I know.
That was unfortunate.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.495
But he was the one
who betrayed me.

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:57.101
He was the one
who pointed a gun.

00:06:57.134 --> 00:06:58.303
You think I wanted that?

00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:00.675
Don't gimme that crap!

00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:04.147
You knew damn well
he wouldn't pull that trigger.

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:12.163
I could've pulled it just fine.

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:19.646
[chuckling]

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.482
[DOFLAMINGO]
I bet so.

00:07:26.158 --> 00:07:30.233
I always knew we were the same.

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:33.472
I wanna destroy
everything that I see!

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:36.345
[LAW]
People. Towns.

00:07:36.378 --> 00:07:39.519
I wanna burn this whole
world to the ground.

00:07:41.724 --> 00:07:43.493
[LAW]
Maybe so.

00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:46.900
But in this case, that's fine.

00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:50.674
[LAW]
'Cause I'll tell you this.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.189
[LAW] You were the one
who should've died that day!

00:07:59.859 --> 00:08:01.596
[DOFLAMINGO]
If you're expecting me to say

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.938
something cold and twisted,
then I'll indulge you.

00:08:05.972 --> 00:08:07.140
Huh?

00:08:07.173 --> 00:08:09.780
I hated Corazon.

00:08:09.813 --> 00:08:13.152
He was a nuisance
and an obstacle to me.

00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:15.524
His insipid sense of justice.

00:08:15.558 --> 00:08:18.598
His worthless sentimentality,
holding me back.

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:20.634
He wasn't worth a damn.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:21.837
And that's why,

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.709
when I killed him
that day, I was happy--

00:08:24.742 --> 00:08:26.913
[LAW]
Counter Shock!

00:08:28.183 --> 00:08:30.320
[DOFLAMINGO groans]

00:08:30.353 --> 00:08:34.061
You go to hell!
I've heard enough!

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.004
Doffy!

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:47.153
[panting]

00:09:18.216 --> 00:09:20.052
[LUFFY]
Traffy!

00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:24.829
[LUFFY]
Hey, buddy! Stay with me!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.238
[gasps] Are you okay?

00:09:29.271 --> 00:09:31.241
Hey, Straw Hat.

00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:35.851
[panting]

00:09:35.884 --> 00:09:39.392
Don't worry about me,
I'll be fine.

00:09:39.425 --> 00:09:43.332
Is it over? Is Doflamingo...

00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:47.140
[LAW gasps]

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:04.976

00:10:05.009 --> 00:10:07.982
Can't keep a String Man down!

[TREBOL laughs]

00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:13.994
[LAW]
What did you do?

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.039
[DOFLAMINGO] If I have
enough time, I can use my powers

00:10:20.073 --> 00:10:23.212
to perform an
operation of my own.

00:10:23.947 --> 00:10:25.618
[DOFLAMINGO]
Right now, beneath the skin,

00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:27.889
my strings are
reconstructing the organs

00:10:27.922 --> 00:10:30.193
you so rudely damaged.

00:10:30.226 --> 00:10:31.262
What the hell?

00:10:31.295 --> 00:10:33.934
[DOFLAMINGO]
Just takes a little creativity.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:38.075
Although I don't know if I would
call this "healing" exactly.

00:10:39.513 --> 00:10:42.250
You threw your life away.

00:10:46.225 --> 00:10:49.566

00:11:04.996 --> 00:11:10.206
[chuckles] And look at that,
I still get to do the honors.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.065
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:11:24.969 --> 00:11:27.741

You know I've been
looking forward to this--

smashing Law's skull in.

No way!

That's the color of the
Supreme King's Haki clashing!

00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:12.363
That brat can use it, too?

Too bad, Straw Hat!

You made it this far,

you'll never stack up

You knocked everyone out cold

Uh-huh.

That's powerful Haki! Wow!

[DOFLAMINGO]
Haki?

And it's the Supreme King's
Haki, too! That's great!

00:16:45.276 --> 00:16:48.650
[TREBOL laughs] Those with

stand above all others!

00:16:50.788 --> 00:16:55.496

00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:40.840
They changed this man
into a perfect demon!

00:18:42.376 --> 00:18:45.750
[TREBOL] The ultimate evil
made to grasp the world

00:18:45.784 --> 00:18:47.854
and tear it asunder!

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:57.206
[laughs] Doffy is a true king!

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:03.251
A demon chosen by Heaven
itself to rule supreme!

00:19:04.722 --> 00:19:08.563
So what? Who cares?

00:19:11.569 --> 00:19:14.207
[yells]

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:24.327
[yells]

00:19:39.992 --> 00:19:44.267
[yells]

00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:03.039
Let's go!

00:20:03.072 --> 00:20:08.516
[yells]

00:20:26.318 --> 00:20:29.591
[chuckles]

00:20:31.695 --> 00:20:34.968
[LUFFY grunts]

00:20:36.572 --> 00:20:38.876
[laughs]

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.951
[yelling]

00:20:45.222 --> 00:20:51.434
[TREBOL laughing]

00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:56.412
[TREBOL] Doffy is a
true hero among villains!

00:20:56.445 --> 00:21:00.787
[LUFFY]
Go to hell! Mingo!

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.329
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:09.939
[TREBOL chuckling]

00:21:09.972 --> 00:21:13.279
[TREBOL]
Doffy's madness...

00:21:13.312 --> 00:21:18.054
...will tear apart
this world at the seams!

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:35.924
[chuckling]

00:21:45.577 --> 00:21:52.791
[DOFLAMINGO chuckling]

00:21:54.360 --> 00:22:00.707
...Eagle Bazooka!

00:22:04.682 --> 00:22:05.650
[gasps]

00:22:08.489 --> 00:22:10.459
[DOFLAMINGO]
Athlete!

00:22:25.456 --> 00:22:28.128
[DOFLAMINGO chuckling]

00:22:32.436 --> 00:22:36.044
This is a joke. Just give up!

00:23:14.588 --> 00:23:16.593
[NARRATOR] In the midst of
his battle with Doflamingo,

00:23:16.626 --> 00:23:17.962
Luffy is attacked by Trebol,

00:23:17.995 --> 00:23:20.365
the final Don Quixote
Family Executive.

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.604
But even with the power
of his Armament Haki,

00:23:22.637 --> 00:23:24.542
Luffy is unable to
strike his body.

00:23:24.575 --> 00:23:26.044
Suddenly gaining the upper hand,

00:23:26.077 --> 00:23:30.085
Trebol prepares to send off Law
and Luffy with a literal bang.

00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:31.655
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.836
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
