00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:13.318
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

00:13:17.394 --> 00:13:21.168
[GIOLLA] The watering can!
Just give it to me!

00:13:29.619 --> 00:13:32.423
Stop it! That's painful!

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.266
[GIOLLA chuckles]

00:13:42.645 --> 00:13:45.851
[cries]

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:55.971
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:05.758
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE 714AA]
What happened?

00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:07.493
Oh, look! He's better!

00:14:07.628 --> 00:14:09.097
[gasps]

00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:10.667
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE 714Z]
Wait. Did you see that?

00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:11.836
Her tears fixed him.

00:14:11.969 --> 00:14:13.907
[GIOLLA]
It did what?

00:14:15.309 --> 00:14:19.250
Oh, so that's how
your power works.

00:14:39.725 --> 00:14:46.272
[GIOLLA chuckles] Keeping
secrets, little princess?

00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:50.781
So even your tears have
the ability to heal people?

00:14:50.915 --> 00:14:53.553
Splendid! Then, cry!

00:14:57.426 --> 00:14:59.765
[GIOLLA]
Cry for me!

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:03.506
[MANSHERRY gasps]
No!

00:15:09.586 --> 00:15:13.527
[GIOLLA] Come on, Princess!
Weep those little eyes out!

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.968
That's hurting me!
Please, no more!

00:15:20.607 --> 00:15:22.344
Leo, hurry!

00:15:22.477 --> 00:15:23.947
On it!

00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:27.521
Speak up! What's wrong?

00:15:27.654 --> 00:15:29.224
It's Giolla.

00:15:29.357 --> 00:15:31.228
She's figured out the
princess's tears heal people.

00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:32.463
[DWARVES]
Huh?!

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:33.867
[VIOLET]
She's forcing her to cry

00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:35.771
by callously inflicting pain.

00:15:35.904 --> 00:15:37.474
[DWARVES]
No!

00:15:37.608 --> 00:15:43.854
No! I'll be right there!
Mouji's comin'!

00:15:43.987 --> 00:15:49.064
It's no use! We can't help.
It's up to Leo and Cub!

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:50.700
She sounds powerful.

00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:52.671
I get why they wanted her.

00:15:52.805 --> 00:15:55.511
[VIOLET] Because of
the Heal-Heal Fruit.

00:15:55.644 --> 00:15:57.681
It's granted her
the ability to mend wounds

00:15:57.815 --> 00:16:01.656
of all living things and
they're forcing her to use it.

00:16:01.789 --> 00:16:03.594
Jeez. I see. Damn.

00:16:03.727 --> 00:16:05.196
[KANJURO, KIN'EMON]
Yes. Damn.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.566
Now, they're harming her.

00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:08.937
It's a twisted
attempt to revitalize

00:16:09.071 --> 00:16:10.875
their defeated Executives.

00:16:11.008 --> 00:16:12.978
It'll be bad if
they pull it off.

00:16:13.112 --> 00:16:18.055
[USOPP gasps] What? Isn't that
basically cheating though?

00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:20.527
That's like an infinite army!

00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:27.574
That sounds very bad.

00:16:31.181 --> 00:16:33.620
And I thought we were
in the clear.

00:16:33.753 --> 00:16:35.022
Leo, hurry!

00:16:35.155 --> 00:16:37.995
Go, Cub! Quickly!

00:16:38.129 --> 00:16:41.235
Wait. Don't tell me!

00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:45.243
Sugar's there with them,
too, isn't she?

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:46.278
[VIOLET]
She is!

00:16:46.412 --> 00:16:49.652
[ALL]
What?!

00:16:49.785 --> 00:16:53.191
Transform into a toy!

00:16:59.638 --> 00:17:04.447
[USOPP screams]

00:17:04.582 --> 00:17:07.722
How the heck do we even the odds
when they keep coming back?

00:17:07.855 --> 00:17:11.462
This really is some Grade A
bull-crap if you ask me!

00:17:11.596 --> 00:17:13.031
[KANJURO, KIN'EMON]
Yes! Truly!

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:15.771
[DWARVES]
Come on, Leo!

00:17:15.904 --> 00:17:17.875
[DWARVES cheering]

00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:20.179
Go! Run, little guy!

00:17:20.313 --> 00:17:21.649
[KIN'EMON, KANJURO]
Save the girl!

00:17:21.783 --> 00:17:24.822
[ALL cheering]

00:17:26.124 --> 00:17:28.095
[MANSHERRY]
No!

00:17:36.979 --> 00:17:39.685
Found it! The naughty room!

00:17:41.088 --> 00:17:42.323
[GIOLLA]
Hm?

00:17:43.259 --> 00:17:45.764
Hey, you! Drop her!

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:46.932
Leo!

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.468
Princess!

00:17:51.776 --> 00:17:53.680
You're too late, hero.

00:17:53.814 --> 00:17:55.349
Grab 'em!

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:01.294
[MANSHERRY gasps]

00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:05.069
Now, wake up, everyone!

00:18:05.202 --> 00:18:08.543
Time for the Don Quixote
Family reunion.

00:18:08.676 --> 00:18:12.784
Round two start!

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.101
[CUB]
Leo! Move it!

00:18:21.234 --> 00:18:24.307
You handle Giolla! Go!

00:18:35.463 --> 00:18:41.141
[CUB]
Beetle Uppercut!

00:18:46.184 --> 00:18:48.623
[gasps] But how?

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:52.496
[LEO]
Sew, sew, sew, sew, sew!

00:18:55.537 --> 00:18:56.839
[LEO]
Sew!

00:18:56.973 --> 00:18:58.910
Sew.

00:18:59.044 --> 00:19:01.716
Sew, sew, sew, sew, sew!

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.495
[huffs] It's fine.
I'll line them up again.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:09.966
You should've grabbed her!

00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:12.069
Then let me help you with that!

00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:14.374
Sew, sew, sew!

00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:18.482
Sew, sew, sew, sew, sew!

00:19:18.617 --> 00:19:19.752
Huh?

00:19:24.027 --> 00:19:25.697
I strung you all together,

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:29.404
so your friends won't
get separated anymore!

00:19:33.914 --> 00:19:35.449
You what? Artless fool!

00:19:35.584 --> 00:19:40.728
Haute Couture! Patch Work, go!

00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:42.564
Oh no!

00:19:58.663 --> 00:20:02.036
[MANSHERRY]
He... He's here.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:06.178
Leo really came to rescue me.

00:20:06.312 --> 00:20:10.052
He's just like a real prince!

00:20:10.186 --> 00:20:13.325
[GIOLLA]
That was crafty...

00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:30.326
He made it! Just in time!

00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:32.931
He did? It's over?

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.802
Madame Ninja?

00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:39.377
The Executives weren't
revived. Leo stopped her!

00:20:39.511 --> 00:20:41.583
[ALL cheer]

00:20:41.716 --> 00:20:44.689
[KIN'EMON] Tiny individual!
Splendid work!

00:20:44.822 --> 00:20:47.360
[VIOLET]
Mansherry is with Leo!

00:20:47.493 --> 00:20:48.997
[DWARVES]
All right!

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:51.702
[DWARVES cheering]

00:20:51.836 --> 00:20:53.973
Finally!

00:21:04.293 --> 00:21:06.932
Leo. I was scared.

00:21:10.674 --> 00:21:14.380
Yeah? Hey, did you
gain some weight?

00:21:21.094 --> 00:21:22.898
Classic Leo.

00:21:49.484 --> 00:21:52.858
[panting]

00:21:54.194 --> 00:22:01.609
[LUFFY panting] Hey, you're in
rough shape, Bellamy.

00:22:03.379 --> 00:22:06.084
If you keep
fighting me like this,

00:22:06.218 --> 00:22:08.656
you really are gonna die!

00:22:12.598 --> 00:22:14.100
Why aren't you trying?

00:22:14.233 --> 00:22:17.373
Don't stand there. Strike back.

00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:22.717
Straw Hat, don't you dare
look down on me.

00:22:22.851 --> 00:22:24.721
Do you know
what this feeling is?

00:22:24.855 --> 00:22:27.293
Do you have any clue
what it's like

00:22:27.426 --> 00:22:30.767
to have your world
crumble under you?

00:22:32.804 --> 00:22:37.981
[chuckles] Even if I die,
I can take you down with me.

00:22:38.115 --> 00:22:39.383
[groans]

00:22:39.518 --> 00:22:41.421
If nothing else,
maybe Doflamingo will

00:22:41.555 --> 00:22:44.628
think on me fondly
when I'm gone.

00:22:46.164 --> 00:22:47.934
[BELLAMY grunts]

00:23:00.092 --> 00:23:03.699
[panting]

00:23:14.588 --> 00:23:16.091
[NARRATOR]
As the brutal battle of blows

00:23:16.224 --> 00:23:18.730
between Franky and
Señor Pink comes to a climax,

00:23:18.863 --> 00:23:21.368
Señor Pink thinks back on
the series of tragic events

00:23:21.502 --> 00:23:24.274
that made him into the
"hard-boiled" man he is today.

00:23:24.407 --> 00:23:26.144
With a heart heavy
with melancholy,

00:23:26.278 --> 00:23:27.681
his feelings of long-lost love

00:23:27.814 --> 00:23:30.386
roar across the battlefield
one last time.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.989
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.122 --> 00:23:35.697
"The Manly Duel!
Señor's Elegy of Love!"

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.970
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
