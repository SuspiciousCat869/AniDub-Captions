WEBVTT

00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.447
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.354
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:46.199
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.571
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.604 --> 00:02:51.810
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:53.714
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.747 --> 00:02:56.219
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.252 --> 00:02:59.058
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.999
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:04.536
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.242
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:12.618
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.692 --> 00:03:17.027
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.631
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:20.535
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:24.308
and launched an attack on
Doflamingo in Dressrosa.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.582
[NARRATOR] In response,
Doflamingo trapped the kingdom

00:03:27.615 --> 00:03:31.288
inside a barrier and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:33.694
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:33.728 --> 00:03:36.198
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:38.236
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.442
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:45.618
[TREBOL gasps]
That's Doffy's double!

00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:50.961
[TREBOL gasps] This is awful!
He got all busted up!

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:59.580
I suppose the cage was
a bit too small, huh?

00:03:59.613 --> 00:04:03.520
I should've known you wouldn't
be so easy to contain.

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:29.471
[LUFFY]
Mingo!

00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:38.356
Bellamy.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.717
What should I do?

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.526
[BELLAMY grunting]

00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:05.076
You okay?

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.782
[gasps]

00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:15.798
That's enough!

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:18.002
[DOFLAMINGO] You don't
have to yell like that.

00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:19.839
I can hear you.

00:05:21.843 --> 00:05:23.079
Mingo, come on!

00:05:23.112 --> 00:05:24.749
Let Bellamy go!

00:05:24.782 --> 00:05:26.620
He's gonna die!

00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:29.693
[DOFLAMINGO] Oh? I didn't
realize he was still alive.

00:05:29.726 --> 00:05:31.630
[gasps]

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:34.836
What a surprise.

00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:40.615
A pity. I set up this
fight to the death,

00:05:40.648 --> 00:05:44.656
but Straw Hat just won't play
by the rules and finish him.

00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:47.728
Well, okay.

00:05:49.732 --> 00:05:51.704
[gasps] Bellamy!

00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:54.007
Doflamingo!

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.216
[DOFLAMINGO]
Fine, Bellamy. I've had my fun.

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:00.621
You're free from me now.

00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:03.326
Just like you've
always been, right?

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:05.564
[gasps]

00:06:22.097 --> 00:06:28.577
[chuckles] You guys are from the
Don Quixote Family, aren't you?

00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:29.679
[DIAMANTE, TREBOL]
Huh?

00:06:29.712 --> 00:06:32.785
You must be Doflamingo himself.

00:06:34.255 --> 00:06:36.025
And who the hell are you?

00:06:36.058 --> 00:06:38.129
Take us in under your umbrella!

00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:39.766
Huh?

00:06:44.008 --> 00:06:45.544
[grunts]

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.184
You better scram
before I gut you.

00:06:49.218 --> 00:06:51.556
What do you say?
Please, Doflamingo!

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:53.460
Who said you could
talk to Doffy?

00:06:53.493 --> 00:06:55.665
You're nothing but
a buncha ratty punks!

00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:58.670
[BELLAMY] I've looked up to you
ever since I was little kid.

00:06:58.704 --> 00:07:01.843
Wherever you go,
we wanna follow you!

00:07:01.877 --> 00:07:05.751
Just give us a chance!
You've got nothing to lose!

00:07:07.487 --> 00:07:11.095
I warned you.
I won't say it again!

00:07:18.978 --> 00:07:20.581
[chuckles]

00:07:20.614 --> 00:07:22.351
[DOFLAMINGO]
Where are you from?

00:07:22.384 --> 00:07:24.789
All of us used to
live in Nortis.

00:07:24.822 --> 00:07:26.392
[DIAMANTE]
That's a wealthy city.

00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:27.662
What's your problem with it?

00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:30.167
It's boring as hell!
I hate that place!

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.241
I think the Don Quixote Family
is the pride of the North Blue!

00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:37.582
[BELLAMY]
We wanna be a real pirate crew.

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:39.619
One just like you guys.

00:07:39.652 --> 00:07:41.389
We're not like those
other pirates out there,

00:07:41.422 --> 00:07:42.491
with their heads in the clouds.

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:44.028
We see things your way.

00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:47.334
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles] I'll let
you use our Jolly Roger,

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:48.236
if that's what you want.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.705
[DIAMANTE]
Doffy!

00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:52.043
Catch is, if you're
ever defeated,

00:07:52.077 --> 00:07:53.581
you'll have to give it up.

00:07:53.614 --> 00:07:56.186
You got it! All right!

00:07:56.219 --> 00:07:59.960
[BELLAMY PIRATES cheer]

00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:04.001
[DOFLAMINGO] I don't need
weaklings as my subordinates.

00:08:04.035 --> 00:08:08.008
[BELLAMY] Don't worry!
I won't lose to anyone!

00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:12.819
[LUFFY] Hey, Bellamy!
Are you hanging in there?

00:08:12.852 --> 00:08:15.557
I mean, I know you're not great.

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:23.005
[BELLAMY cackles]

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:29.284
So you must be that
Straw Hat Luffy kid.

00:08:29.317 --> 00:08:32.023
Worth a cool
30 million, I hear.

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:40.140
[cackles]

00:08:40.173 --> 00:08:43.446
What a shame.
Seems you're a lost cause.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.850
Thing is,

00:08:44.883 --> 00:08:49.158
the time when pirates
dreamt about the future is over!

00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:51.797
Things like the great One Piece?

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.602
The fools who dream of
these fictional treasures

00:08:54.636 --> 00:08:57.174
don't notice the real treasures
that surround them!

00:08:57.207 --> 00:09:00.147
They end up chasing these
ridiculous puppy dog dreams

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.917
and die in the process!

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.325
[cackles] There's nothing
but a bunch of dead idiots!

00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:12.538
[BELLAMY] You see,
there was no point in trying.

00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:14.108
I've eaten a cursed fruit, too,

00:09:14.141 --> 00:09:17.147
and you don't stand
a chance against me.

00:09:19.786 --> 00:09:24.896
[BELLAMY]
Spring Hopper!

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.283
There's no city
of gold out there!

00:09:35.316 --> 00:09:38.757
There's no island in the sky.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:44.034
Just oceans, and ships,
and the men who sail them!

00:09:46.272 --> 00:09:49.344
[cackles]

00:09:49.378 --> 00:09:53.352
[LUFFY] You asked if I know
how to throw a punch.

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:56.960
All right Straw Hat, it's over!

00:09:56.993 --> 00:09:58.830
[yells]

00:10:15.163 --> 00:10:20.775
For starters, I saw the
Sky Island, just like you.

00:10:20.808 --> 00:10:23.112
I lost all my crewmates
on that trip,

00:10:23.145 --> 00:10:26.285
but it turned my view
of the world upside down.

00:10:26.318 --> 00:10:29.491
I'm not gonna hold a grudge
against you anymore.

00:10:29.526 --> 00:10:33.399
Either way, I'm done
laughing at you.

00:10:34.636 --> 00:10:36.072
[LUFFY]
You okay?

00:10:36.105 --> 00:10:39.177
I can't believe you had the gall
to cheer for me back there.

00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:41.482
That was so embarrassing.

00:10:41.517 --> 00:10:44.088
And a lot of good it did.

00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:47.928
I ain't changed one bit.
It's pathetic!

00:10:47.962 --> 00:10:50.868
You have changed, Bellamy.

00:10:56.112 --> 00:10:58.449
I've seen you wield
your Haki powers.

00:10:58.482 --> 00:11:01.790
They're stronger than anything
I've ever dreamed of.

00:11:01.823 --> 00:11:04.394
Which really pisses me off.

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:12.243
[LUFFY] Hey, don't push
yourself! Just rest for a sec!

00:11:15.317 --> 00:11:18.723
So Joker is ordering me
to murder Straw Hat now?

00:11:18.757 --> 00:11:21.094
Doffy's a generous leader.

00:11:21.128 --> 00:11:22.732
Even though you lost
the tournament,

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:25.905
he's giving you one more
chance to redeem yourself.

00:11:25.938 --> 00:11:28.677
You should be happy
your task is so easy.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.282
[DELLINGER laughs]
Well, if you're standing there

00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:32.585
and not murdering Straw Hat,

00:11:32.618 --> 00:11:34.556
then I say you're
not busy enough!

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:38.028
You need me to
give you hand? [laughs]

00:11:38.062 --> 00:11:39.231
Buzz off!

00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:42.003
But y'know, it doesn't
matter if you fail!

00:11:42.036 --> 00:11:44.943
In fact, the whole thing never
mattered in the first place!

00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:46.145
What d'you mean by that?

00:11:46.178 --> 00:11:47.782
It's annoying how
you keep trying to

00:11:47.816 --> 00:11:49.250
win our approval, y'know!

00:11:49.284 --> 00:11:53.059
That's why I'm gonna finish
you off, right here and now.

00:11:53.092 --> 00:11:55.396
On the young master's order.

00:11:59.573 --> 00:12:01.610
Huh. Weird. An earthquake?

00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:04.381
[BELLAMY groans]

00:12:05.718 --> 00:12:08.188
Why did you come here?

00:12:09.626 --> 00:12:14.635
Is there any hope
for me to join you?

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:21.849
[chuckles] You really want me to
spell it out for you? All right.

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:26.593
[DOFLAMINGO] Your purpose has
never been the same as mine.

00:12:26.627 --> 00:12:28.697
Even from the start.

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:34.474
For example, you always wanted
to be a pirate, right?

00:12:34.508 --> 00:12:37.313
Me, not so much.

00:12:37.347 --> 00:12:39.719
The methods didn't matter.

00:12:39.753 --> 00:12:42.090
For what?

00:12:42.123 --> 00:12:45.030
For the only thing I care about.

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:47.735
Destroying this world.

00:12:47.769 --> 00:12:51.909
[chuckles]

00:12:56.553 --> 00:12:58.590
[LUFFY]
I can't do that!

00:12:58.623 --> 00:13:00.493
You're my friend!

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.974
Fine, Bellamy.

00:13:07.007 --> 00:13:08.877
You're free from me now.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.381
Just like you always have been.

00:13:15.322 --> 00:13:16.894
Hey, Bellamy.

00:13:16.927 --> 00:13:19.498
I'm sorry, I gotta
leave you here for now.

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.670
I'm real worried about Traffy.

00:13:21.703 --> 00:13:24.341
The real Mingo and
Snot Guy are up there.

00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:27.548
They're too strong.
He needs my help.

00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:31.255
I'll give Mingo an extra
kick in the ass for you, okay?

00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:33.627
Hold on!

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.465
You remember this technique?

00:13:36.498 --> 00:13:38.135
It's been a while.

00:13:38.169 --> 00:13:39.437
Huh?

00:14:03.553 --> 00:14:06.191
Okay. You ready?

00:14:06.224 --> 00:14:08.697
Spring Hopper!

00:14:08.731 --> 00:14:11.001
Let's go!

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.076
[gasps]

00:14:35.617 --> 00:14:40.293
You got stronger since last
time, but I got stronger, too!

00:14:41.328 --> 00:14:46.004
You wanna see destructive power?
I've taken this to the max!

00:15:13.492 --> 00:15:14.695
[PICA]
Huh?

00:15:17.935 --> 00:15:20.372
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:15:22.778 --> 00:15:26.418
[PICA laughs]

00:15:27.353 --> 00:15:28.657
[DELLINGER]
Watch it, Pica!

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:29.859
[PICA]
Hm?

00:15:29.892 --> 00:15:30.962
[DELLINGER]
You've got friends down here

00:15:30.995 --> 00:15:32.565
you're about to squash!

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.201
[IDEO]
Destruction Cannon!

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:36.071
[gasps]

00:15:39.712 --> 00:15:41.850
Ignore me at your
own peril, kid!

00:15:41.883 --> 00:15:44.655
Ohh! So scary!

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.368
That's enough already!

00:15:55.043 --> 00:16:01.857
[panting] Just tell me!

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.760
[SAI gasps]

00:16:03.793 --> 00:16:05.096
[BABY 5]
If you're serious about this,

00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:08.135
why are you beating
around the bush so much?

00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:11.643
Because I'm your enemy?

00:16:11.676 --> 00:16:14.348
I don't care! Be honest with me!

00:16:14.381 --> 00:16:16.886
I dunno what you're
talking about, lady!

00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:18.723
Don't play dumb!

00:16:24.535 --> 00:16:28.610
This next blow will strike
straight through your heart!

00:16:28.643 --> 00:16:31.549
You said that you were
aiming for my heart.

00:16:32.384 --> 00:16:35.858
[SAI chuckles] I'll hold
this hand 'til you die!

00:16:35.891 --> 00:16:38.964
You wanted to hold
hands our whole life!

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:41.936
[SAI] Don't wanna
lose you on this one!

00:16:41.969 --> 00:16:44.675
And you never want
to lose me, right?

00:16:49.318 --> 00:16:53.092
If your feelings for me
really are that strong,

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:56.398
then I don't care if
we're enemies or not!

00:16:59.906 --> 00:17:05.618
No, I understand!
You need me, don't you?

00:17:05.651 --> 00:17:07.788
[gasps]

00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:12.130
[HAJRUDIN panting]

00:17:12.163 --> 00:17:15.436
[MACHVISE]
Ten-Ton Vise!

00:17:18.342 --> 00:17:20.714
[screams]

00:17:25.122 --> 00:17:28.161
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES cheer]

00:17:36.444 --> 00:17:39.718
Huh? Better give 'em one more!

00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:46.231
[MACHVISE]
Here comes another crush-een!

00:17:46.264 --> 00:17:48.937
Hundred-Ton Vise!

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.742
[HAJRUDIN screams]

00:17:53.479 --> 00:17:56.585
[MACHVISE]
Hm? Not giv-een up?

00:17:59.592 --> 00:18:02.196
Ton-Ton, go to hell!

00:18:04.702 --> 00:18:07.741
[HAJRUDIN groans]

00:18:09.444 --> 00:18:11.882
[screams]

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.795
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
Lord Vise shows no mercy, huh?

00:18:17.828 --> 00:18:19.899
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE D]
Even a mighty warrior of Elbaf

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:22.336
gets crushed under his weight!

00:18:24.642 --> 00:18:29.250
[MACHVISE] Okay. Let's get
a better look at th-eengs.

00:18:29.284 --> 00:18:30.754
Hajrud-een is down,

00:18:30.787 --> 00:18:34.427
so let's start search-een
for my next target!

00:18:38.436 --> 00:18:42.678
Ooh. That's Roronoa Zoro!

00:18:45.483 --> 00:18:47.053
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
The bigger they are, the harder

00:18:47.087 --> 00:18:48.790
they fall, I guess!

00:18:48.824 --> 00:18:52.229
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE D] You're in
our way, you giant roadblock!

00:18:52.263 --> 00:18:55.738
[HAJRUDIN] My dream was
to become the strongest.

00:18:55.771 --> 00:18:58.342
The King of all Giants.

00:18:58.376 --> 00:19:00.647
But look at me now.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.387
[HAJRUDIN]
I lost in the competition.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.093
I was transformed into a toy.

00:19:07.127 --> 00:19:11.602
I was saved, but I've
failed to repay my debt.

00:19:14.074 --> 00:19:16.579
[HAJRUDIN]
This is pathetic.

00:19:18.082 --> 00:19:20.252
[HAJRUDIN]
I vowed to aid the Straw Hats,

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:22.892
even if it cost me
my life itself,

00:19:22.925 --> 00:19:27.901
and yet here I lie, defeated,
but shamelessly still alive.

00:19:27.934 --> 00:19:31.509
[MACHVISE chuckles]
Ton-Ton!

00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:36.318
[HAJRUDIN] Was my gratitude
truly so shallow?

00:19:36.351 --> 00:19:39.925
Damn it! Damn it!

00:19:43.365 --> 00:19:46.138
Here I come, Roronoa!

00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:47.439
That's not good.

00:19:47.473 --> 00:19:51.415
Destructive
One Thousand-Ton Vise!

00:19:51.448 --> 00:19:56.291
[HAJRUDIN]
No! My honor will not allow it!

00:20:04.742 --> 00:20:07.848
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]
He got up!

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:14.393
Forgive me, but if you would,
please let me handle him.

00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:20.272
Hajrud-een! Still stand-een?

00:20:20.305 --> 00:20:23.913
And right after I gave you
such a proper pound-een!

00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:31.428
[MACHVISE] Then I'll make it
ev-een heavier for you!

00:20:31.461 --> 00:20:35.235
Hellish Ten Thousand-Ton Vise!

00:20:38.408 --> 00:20:41.783
I really hope there are
still some bones leftover

00:20:41.816 --> 00:20:43.786
for crusheen!

00:20:50.366 --> 00:20:52.838
[HAJRUDIN]
I'm no use to my allies dead.

00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:56.078
But as long as I can
move even a single arm,

00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:58.248
I can defeat an enemy leader!

00:20:58.281 --> 00:21:02.691
The last of my life
I place in this fist!

00:21:02.724 --> 00:21:07.066
Gungnir, go!

00:21:18.022 --> 00:21:22.764
[HAJRUDIN grunting]

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:34.021
Stop strug-leen.

00:21:34.054 --> 00:21:36.491
This is way too heavy!

00:21:41.936 --> 00:21:46.712
[HAJRUDIN grunting]

00:21:49.417 --> 00:21:52.791
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Get squashed, Hajrudin!

00:21:52.825 --> 00:21:57.834
[HAJRUDIN] Let him fly!
To the Kingdom of the Gods!

00:21:57.868 --> 00:22:04.815
[yelling]

00:22:05.617 --> 00:22:10.025
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]
Lord Vise!

00:22:10.894 --> 00:22:13.365
The Birdcage! No!

00:22:13.398 --> 00:22:16.438
He's not slowing down at all!

00:22:16.471 --> 00:22:18.943
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
Lord Vise, stop!

00:22:18.976 --> 00:22:21.983
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
You're gonna get shredded!

00:22:22.016 --> 00:22:25.355
[MACHVISE groans]

00:22:28.763 --> 00:22:33.071
[panting]

00:22:37.848 --> 00:22:41.054
Those skies are still
too far for you.

00:22:41.088 --> 00:22:43.759
You're no bird, after all.

00:22:45.596 --> 00:22:48.268
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Lord Vise!

00:22:48.302 --> 00:22:50.472
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

00:22:58.956 --> 00:23:00.627
Enjoy your nap.

00:23:00.661 --> 00:23:03.866
And when you wake up,
the cage will be gone.

00:23:14.387 --> 00:23:16.090
[NARRATOR] Sai struggles
to continue his battle

00:23:16.124 --> 00:23:19.532
against Baby 5 in the face of
her sudden feelings toward him.

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:21.502
Meanwhile, his grandfather,
Don Chin Jao

00:23:21.536 --> 00:23:23.539
is torn between
his fight with Lao G

00:23:23.573 --> 00:23:26.211
and his concerns for the
legacy of the Happosui Army.

00:23:26.245 --> 00:23:27.413
With his future at stake,

00:23:27.446 --> 00:23:29.350
Sai unleashes
a powerful new technique!

00:23:29.384 --> 00:23:30.920
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:30.954 --> 00:23:35.730
"The Battle of Love!
The New Leader Sai vs. Baby 5!"

00:23:35.763 --> 00:23:38.869
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
