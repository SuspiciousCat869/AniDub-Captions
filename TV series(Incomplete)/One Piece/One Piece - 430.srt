That must be a shock,
coming from me.

I used to visit Whitebeard's
ship on a regular basis.

But because of my status
with the government,

444

I'd travel underwater
to get there.

I owe Whitebeard a great debt.

a peaceful haven once again.

As you know, pirates
sailing along the Grand Line

454
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:45,709
must pass through Fishman Island
to reach the New World.

455
00:19:45,742 --> 00:19:48,712
So, not long after the dawn
of the Great Pirate Era,

456
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:51,615
the island was in trouble.

457
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,218
[JIMBEI] Numerous human
pirates and Navy ships

458
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:55,953
that were chasing
after Whitebeard

00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,655
arrived there, wreaking havoc.

Countless Fishmen and mermaids

and sold as slaves.

And just when despair threatened
to conquer our hearts...

463
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:11,835
Whitebeard showed himself.

464
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,739
[WHITEBEARD]
From this point forward,

465
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:18,909
I claim this island
as my territory!

466
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:21,278
[JIMBEI]
A simple proclamation.

467
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:23,447
A precious few words
ensured that no one

468
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,983
would lay a finger
on Fishman Island again.

469
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,353
The power that Whitebeard
commands is that great.

470
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:32,756
As long as I live,
I will never forget that day.

The government targets
him because he is a pirate,

474
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:42,833
but they refuse
to see the truth!

00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,668
That is why I object.

476
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,804
If he happened to die,
what would become of the sea?

welcome the chaos

478
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:51,875
that would reign
in his absence?

to usher in such madness?
