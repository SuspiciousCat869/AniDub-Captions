00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,804
What is it? Your sick
mother needs medicine?

176
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,706
Or did your wife
run away with another man

177
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,442
and leave you all alone to
raise the children by yourself?

178
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,877
Hey. Hold on.

179
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,314
Don't explain,
just come with me.

180
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,388
Augh. Marines?

181
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:19,892
[TASHIGI]
Here.

182
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:23,896
Lucky for you,
our janitor quit this morning.

183
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,298
Once you start
working for the Marines,

184
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,134
you'll never have to worry about
money problems ever again.

185
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,269
There will always
be a job here for you.

186
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,739
Not a chance in hell.
I don't work for Marines.

187
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,974
You can't leave now.

188
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,410
I expect to be paid back
for my glasses.

189
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,278
Maybe after you've finished
cleaning the floors

190
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,180
you can work on
cleaning up your attitude

191
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,849
if this is the way you're
going to repay my kindness.

192
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,751
Ahhh, crap.

193
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,120
[MARINE D] Sergeant major,
it's time for training.

194
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,356
[TASHIGI]
I'll be back to check on you.

195
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,325
She's a Sergeant?

196
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,261
[NAMI humming]

197
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,464
Shopping always
makes me feel better.

198
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,206
Damn it. How the hell
did this happen to me?

199
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,809
Zoro... With the Marines?

200
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,045
What is going on here?

201
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,951
Crap. This is going
to take the whole damn day.

202
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,353
Unless...

203
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,893
Three mop technique
worked like a charm.

204
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,031
[MARINE F, TASHIGI grunting]

205
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,467
‐‐[MARINE F groans]
‐‐[MARINE H] One more time.

206
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,973
[ZORO]
Hmm.

207
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,309
Hey you! Just what
do you think you're doin'?

208
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,243
[ZORO]
Huh?

209
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,412
[MARINE K]
It's Zoro! The pirate hunter!

210
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,814
Why are you cleaning?

211
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,149
[MARINE J]
Intel says you've teamed up

212
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,385
with Monkey D. Luffy's crew.

213
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,519
[ZORO grunts]

214
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,388
Drop the mop.

215
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,330
Well... Guess I should leave.

216
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,503
What happened here?

217
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,937
They appear
to have been attacked,

218
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,373
but there is no sign
of who's responsible.

219
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,946
New glasses.

220
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,402
[ZORO]
Man, that was just too weird.

221
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,805
She looked just like Kuina.

222
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,941
Not to mention she was
a swordsman of all things.

223
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,812
What a crazy world.
I doubt I'll ever see her again.

224
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,419
[footsteps]

225
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,089
[MATSU snoring]

226
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,890
I'd like to pick up some swords.

227
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,327
[hollers]
Of course, of course, welcome.

228
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,096
Have a look
at anything you'd like.

229
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:13,566
We have an extremely large
variety to choose from.

230
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,434
I've got 100,000 berries.

231
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,270
For two swords. Can you do that?

232
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,473
Two for 100,000?

233
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,442
[MATSU]
Great. This guy is broke.

234
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,846
Eeeh. For 50,000 a piece
I can only give you

235
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,314
two dull blades.

236
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:29,915
I can make do with whatever.

237
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,518
I just don't
have the money right now.

238
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,420
[MATSU]
You can't make do with whatever

239
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,523
unless you're an amateur. Wait!

240
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,326
That sword. Could it be?

241
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,161
N‐N‐N‐Now‐‐
now hold on a second.

242
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,830
I just wanna take a look
at that s‐sword you got there.

243
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,866
Is that ok‐k‐kay with you, pal?

244
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,001
[ZORO]
You okay there, buddy?

245
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,136
Let me see!

246
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,138
[ZORO]
Yeah, whatever...

247
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,176
[MATSU]
This is really it!

248
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,946
Stay cool.
Poker face. Poker face.

249
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,117
A complete amateur just walked
in with a legendary sword.

250
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,219
It's show time.

251
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,522
Wow, that's a
pretty nice sword you got.

252
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,458
You wanna sell it? I'll give you
200,000 berries for it.

253
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,227
Whaddya say? That will
leave you with 300,000

254
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,029
which should buy you
some pretty good steel.

255
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,864
At 100,000 a piece,
there are bound to be

256
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,966
three swords you like in here.

257
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,968
What? Are you kidding me?

258
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,236
[MATSU]
All right.

259
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:29,241
I'll give you 250,000 berries.
No wait, 300,000.

260
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,177
Final offer: 500,000!

261
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,046
Just stop. I'm not selling.
The sword is mine.

262
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,217
Tough guy! I'll buy it
from you for 650,000 berries!

263
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,586
Errr! Okay! Fine, I give up.

264
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,556
How does 800,000 berries
sound to you?

265
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,057
[TASHIGI]
I'm back.

266
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,028
Did you finish
polishing my Shigure?

267
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,497
You're okay.
I was worried about you.

268
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,365
See, some Marines
were attacked earlier

269
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,501
right by where you had
been mopping the floors.

270
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,369
You were gone though,
so naturally I just assumed

271
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,171
that you had been kidnapped.

272
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,406
Thank goodness
you're okay though.

273
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,208
[ZORO]
She's not very bright.

274
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,543
The fact that you're here
means you must have run away.

275
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,079
Sad, you really must have
no idea how to accept love

276
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,048
when it comes your way, do you.

277
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,349
So here's your
stupid money back.

278
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:14,286
I don't need it. I can't accept
money from a heartless ingrate.

279
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,023
Besides, look. I already
got some new glasses.

280
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,125
[gasps]

281
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,896
That sword looks
just like the Wado Ichimonji.

282
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,198
Is this really the sword?

283
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,433
[ZORO]
Wado?!

284
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,202
[MATSU]
Stop talking. Stop talking.

285
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,472
It's beautiful.

286
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,076
This has to be one of
the 21 O‐Wazamono swords.

287
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,079
See... Look at this.

288
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,547
It says here
that this sword is worth

289
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,983
no less than 10 million berries.

290
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,585
But you're broke; how do you
have this legendary sword?

291
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,088
Damn! You just had to
keep talking, didn't you?

292
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,924
I'm going to sue your ass
for obstruction of business.

293
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,459
Obstruction of business?

294
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:57,096
I'm sorry. I don't know what
I did, but please forgive me.

295
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,999
Here, I've finished polishing
your precious Shigure for you.

296
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,300
Now just take it and get out.

297
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,235
I don't want to see you
in my store again.

298
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,405
[TASHIGI gasping]

299
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,741
Just get out before
you tear my store apart!

300
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,076
I‐I'm so sorry.

301
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,345
Did she ever
help you dodge a bullet!

302
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,115
It is a complete waste
to have such a legendary sword

303
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,318
attached to someone who has
no idea of its true value.

304
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,020
You can pick from
our lovely selection

305
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,422
of barrel swords
for 50,000 a piece.

306
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,457
Pick any two you like.

307
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,626
Ugh! What is that guy's problem?

308
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,361
[TASHIGI] You must lose
a lot of swords if you think

309
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,497
you have to carry
three of them around.

310
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,300
Unless of course you're like
that famous pirate hunter.

311
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,001
Pirate hunter, yeah.

312
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,637
He's quite the legend.
His name is Roronoa.

313
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,139
Oh yeah, him.

314
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,007
Yeah. He's known
throughout the East Blue

315
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,344
for his amazing sword skills.
But he's not a good person.

316
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,112
A swordsman who is
just a bounty hunter

317
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,214
is no honorable
swordsman at all.

318
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,516
Everything's backwards.

319
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,985
It's really too bad
for real swordsmen.

320
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,220
Pirates and bounty hunters
as sword masters,

321
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,356
it just doesn't make any sense.

322
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,693
They have most of the world's
legendary swords, too.

323
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,728
It's a real tragedy.

324
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,630
[ZORO chuckles]

325
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:05,564
Oh, I don't know.

326
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,366
That's the kind of thing
you have to look at

327
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,568
on a case by case basis I guess.

328
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,370
You never know
what people are capable of.

329
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,571
This is my Shigure.

330
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,174
I am going to work as hard
as I can to perfect my skills

331
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,676
and then one day I'll take back
all the legendary swords,

332
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,244
because the filthy hands
that hold them now

333
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,146
have no right to wield them.

334
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,049
Yes. The 21...
Top O‐Wazamonos...

335
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,820
The 21 O‐Wazamonos, as well
as the Ryo‐Wazamonos...

336
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,755
I'll find them all.

337
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,191
And this one? My sword.

338
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:36,595
The Wado Ichimonji.

339
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,530
I'm not trying to get
the legendary swords

340
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,366
back for my sake.

341
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,202
I just don't want
criminals to have them.

342
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,042
[ZORO]
This sword is...

343
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,745

Kitetsu the third!

Its predecessor,
Kitetsu the second,

347
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,789
is an O‐Wazamono sword and
Kitetsu the first before that
