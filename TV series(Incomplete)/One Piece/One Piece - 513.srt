[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:40,394
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,962
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,998
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,533
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,336
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,004
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,940
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,810
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,446
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,980
of the World Government,

12
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,950
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,586
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,023
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:13,226
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,898

the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,570
[NARRATOR]
After losing his brother, Ace,

18
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,205
in the War of the Best
against the Navy,

19
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,341
Luffy sent a message to his crew

20
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,143
in a way that only
they would grasp.

21
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,084
I hope they get the message...
wherever they are.

22
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:40,054
If anyone can understand
you, it's them.

23
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,422
They'll understand
if they see the article.

24
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,625
They are your crew after all.

25
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:47,661
[CHOPPER]
I got it, Luffy! Don't worry!

26
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,431
[CHOPPER]
A change of plans, then!

27
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:53,901
Yeah, okay, okay!

28
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,203
So, that's it. Very well, then.

29
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,239
[ROBIN]
Interesting as always, Luffy.

30
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,609
Roger that, Captain!

[USOPP]
I've got it!

32
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,312
Yes, Luffy! Yes!

33
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,880
[NAMI]
But honestly, Luffy!

34
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:10,050
How about how I feel,
huh? You're so selfish!

35
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,552
I gotcha, Boss.

36
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,087
Hah. How very clever of you!

37
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:17,057
Normally, Luffy wouldn't
do something like this.

38
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,727
Rayleigh's with him, so it must
be some idea he cooked up.

39
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,063
There's gotta be a catch here.

Whitebeard's era has ended,

ambitious pirates
all over the world

44
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,885

[NARRATOR]
Trafalgar Law, however,

46
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,856
has something else in mind.

47
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,226
[PENGUIN] What? You don't
want to leave yet?

48
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,461
[SHACHI] Come on, let's
go to the New World!

49
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,731
[PENGUIN] We've been sitting
around here long enough already!

50
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,966
[SHACHI]
Yeah, what are we waiting for?

51
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,904
Like I said, we're gonna
leave when it's time.

52
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:05,272
Have some patience.

53
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,174
One Piece isn't going anywhere.

54
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,276
For now, we just bide our time.

But Captain!

56
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,347
Blackbeard's already starting to
make his move in the New World!

57
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,715
And in a big way, too!

58
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:18,051
I heard he's already taken down
at least one crew of pirates!

59
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,686
[HEART PIRATE A]
Yeah, and a bunch of rookies

are heading over there hoping
to take Whitebeard's place

as an Emperor!

62
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,125
[HEART PIRATE B]
If we keep wasting time,

63
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,162
all the other pirates'll
leave us in the dust for sure!

64
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,930
We're better off
letting them eliminate

65
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,266
each other before we get there.

66
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,634
That'll thin out
the competition, right?

67
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,738
Now why don't you
dispense with the whining

68
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,840
and do as I tell you for once?

69
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:43,144

think we should get out of here.

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,721
It wasn't our fault, that
raft had sentimental value!

172
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:23,323
None of you lot ever
prepare for anything.

173
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,058
You're all to blame for this.

174
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,860
Hey, I got an idea, Teach!

175
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:29,863
Maybe you oughta let me be
the Captain from here on meowt?

176
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:32,866
[chuckles] Oh, don't
make me kill you.

177
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,236
We're the Blackbeard
Pirates, remember?

178
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,471
Heaven only knows
what's going to become

179
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,407
of our miserable
souls after this.

180
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,511
[laughs] I need some more booze.

181
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:47,381
Can we find an island with
more liquor and less fire?

182
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,516
[laughs]

183
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,320
No kidding. A new ship's nice,
but I need a new outfit first.

184
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,455
These jailbird
clothes are just awful.

185
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,658
You'll have to
endure it for now.

186
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,060
Thick horizontal stripes make
me look heavy, you know.

187
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:04,364
Dah, do they? Maybe I'm
still too sober to notice.

188
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,168
You spy any Navy
ships out there?

189
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,668
I'll go and take a look.

190
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,138
Surely they know better
than to make us wait.

191
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,373
Let's hope so!

192
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,976
'Cause this old crew's gettin'
tired of roasting alive!

193
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,112
[BONNEY groans]

194
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:22,716
[BLACKBEARD] Ain't that right,
Miss Jewelry Bonney?

195
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,852
Poor Captain Bonney.

196
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:29,022
[panting]

197
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,525
And to think that a sweet
little thing like you's

198
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,695
racked up a bounty of
over 100,000,000 berries!

199
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:38,432
Only the strongest can hope to
sail the seas of the New World.

200
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:41,568
Ya might've come all the way
from the South Blue,

201
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:43,737
but I'm afraid your
voyage stops here.

202
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:46,140
[BLACKBEARD cackles]

203
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,042
[BLACKBEARD PIRATES laughing]

204
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,544
I'm afraid you're
not tough enough

205
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,446
to cut it as
a member of my crew,

206
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,415
but, hey, I might be
willing to let you tag along

207
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,984
if you promise to be my girl.

208
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,285
[BONNEY grunts]

209
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:01,388
That sound like
a deal to you? Huh?

210
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,823
No way, fatass!

211
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,492
--[BLACKBEARD groans]
--[BONNEY] I'll kill you!

[BLACKBEARD PIRATES laughing]

213
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,162
That sounds like a no.

214
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,798
What? I asked you nicely!

215
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,067
Women oughta have more decency!

216
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,404
This lousy crew's indecent
enough to begin with!

217
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,506
That's nice of you
to say, Captain!

218
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,008
[GROUP laughing]

219
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:25,078
Might as well leave the broad
with the Navy like we planned!

220
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,948
I was gonna keep her and steal
the ship, but screw that.

221
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:29,082
--[VAN AUGER] Captain.
--Huh?

222
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,051
[VAN AUGER]
The Navy is on their way.

223
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:34,388
About damn time! And do they
have our ship with 'em?

224
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:37,425
[VAN AUGER] They brought one,
but they're not giving it to us.

225
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,893
[BLACKBEARD]
What? How do you know that?

226
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,563
[VAN AUGER]
Because Akainu's on it.

227
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,700
[BLACKBEARD] Damn it! That's not
what I need to hear right now.

228
00:12:46,734 --> 00:12:49,403
--[BLACKBEARD PIRATES shouting]
--[BLACKBEARD] Let's get movin'!

229
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,137
[BURGESS]
We screwed up!

230
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,711
[AKAINU]
Where's Blackbeard?

231
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,479
[MARINE A]
He's gone, sir!

232
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:02,682
[AKAINU] When I found out you
had escaped from the Government,

233
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,651
it nearly froze my blood.

234
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,153
[BONNEY grunts]

235
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:09,090
Oh, well. I suppose
it's all over now.

236
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:11,892
[gasps] You bastards!

237
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,394
I'm gonna make you pay,
do you hear me?

238
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:21,968
Disappeared?

239
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:25,572
Yeah, that's the best
way I can describe it.

240
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,808
So, Sengoku put you up to this?

241
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:29,409
I'll tear him apart!

242
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:33,513
Nah, think higher up the ladder.

243
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,383
[MORIA groans]

244
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:38,385
That ain't a figure
of speech either.

245
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:41,722
One minute he's there and
then poof, gone! [chuckles]

246
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,890
Not bad, huh? What can I say?

247
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,227
That Shadow Shadow
Fruit is tricky!

248
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,628
[NOBLE A]
It's not a joke!

249
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,196
Relax, buddy.

250
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,865
He was beat up
pretty bad anyway.

251
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,568
So, I guarantee you
he's dead by now.

252
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,370
Well, he's got that
zombie thing going on,

253
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:59,372
so he might come back
from the dead. [chuckles]

254
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:00,741
Now that would be ironic.

255
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:04,578
You shouldn't have done
such a sloppy job.

256
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:06,046
--[NOBLE A gasps]
--And you shouldn't

257

be getting cocky, my friend,

because the last time
I checked, you're not my boss.

No matter what kind of
authority you might have

as part of the World Government,
I'm still a pirate,

261
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,524

tired of doing business

with the likes of you clowns,

265
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:26,067
I can just give up
my title as a Warlord.

even seen in books before!

00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,480
Here. Should help for learning.

342
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,817
[CHOPPER gasps]
Hey, where are we?

343
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:05,585
[NATIVE L]
Me show you.

344
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,356
[CHOPPER gasps]

345
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,364
[NATIVE L]
Village library.

346
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,233
You maybe can study in here.

347
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,001
[CHOPPER]
So many books!

348
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,403
[CHOPPER giggles]

349
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:25,105
[CHOPPER] Whoa, the walls
are covered in 'em!

350
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:31,245
Hey! You've got books on all the
plants I wanted to learn about.

351
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,747
This is exactly what I needed!

352
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,050
[CHOPPER]
Just look at all these.

353
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,719
[NATIVE L] Island have many
useful plant for make medicine.

354
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:43,056
We know how to make before,
but birds got in way.

355
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,725
Even though we have knowledge,
we stuck long time without

356
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,662
ingredients and
family got bad sick.

357
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:50,297
Wow, this is crazy.

358
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,900
I shouldn't have judged
them by their looks.

359
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,735
I guess their weapons
are pretty high-tech

360
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,603
now that I think about it.

361
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,772
I mean sure, they talk
dumb and look dumb.

362
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,173
--[NATIVE L gasps]
--But they're pretty smart

363
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:03,377
and their medical science
is the best I've ever seen!

364
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,012
I've got a lot to learn!

365
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,313
Stop, Raccoon!

366
00:19:06,347 --> 00:19:08,382
Maybe you thinking
you talking quietly

367
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,717
so nobody hear you,
but you very loud!

368
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,519
And you not say
a very nice thing.

369
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,288
Makes me wonder...

370
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,990
How much can I accomplish
on this island?

371
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,127
[VILLAGER C] Hey, what is
that creature over there?

372
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,763
[VILLAGER D]
It looks like a yeti!

373
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:26,566
[VILLAGER E] It's dangerous.
Get the children inside quickly!

374
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,436
[VILLAGER C]
A gun! Bring me a gun!

375
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,773
--[VILLAGER D] Yeah, shoot him!
--[VILLAGER F] It's a monster!

376
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:34,508
[VILLAGER F]
See? I told you he was real.

377
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,543
[VILLAGER D]
Kill it!

378
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:38,478
--[VILLAGERS shouting]
--[CHOPPER crying]

379
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:42,182

380
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,621
--[gunshot]
--[CHOPPER gasps]

381
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:02,236
A skull?

382
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,405
[HIRILUK]
This symbolizes my belief

383
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:06,774
that nothing is impossible!

384
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:08,442
By raising this flag,

385
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:11,511
I vow to fight just
like the pirates do!

386
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,314
It's great to be a pirate!

387
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:16,484
The most amazing
people sail the seas.

388
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:19,319
Chopper, someday you've
got to go to sea!

389
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:22,089
If you do, you'll realize
just how small your problems

390
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:25,392
really are in comparison
to the vastness of the oceans.

391
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:28,862
The island you were born on is
like this compared to the world!

392
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:29,863
[CHOPPER]
Really?

393
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:33,467
[HIRILUK]
No, it's smaller! Like this.

394
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,503
[HIRILUK, CHOPPER laugh]

395
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:40,340
[HIRILUK] Your destiny
lies beyond that shining sea!

396
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:43,677
Hey! You're gonna
to come on our ship

397
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,647
and be a pirate with us, 'kay?

398
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,983
[CHOPPER] Listen, maybe
I do want to be a pirate.

399
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,787
[CHOPPER]
But I can't ever be one of you!

400
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,723
I'm not a human! I'm a monster!

401
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,393
I can't be your friend,
and I can't join your crew!

402
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:03,230
So... I just wanted to say...

403
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,136
...I really
appreciate the offer.

404
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,537
It was nice of you,

405
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,539
so thank you.

406
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:15,008
I'm just gonna stay here but...

407
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,245
[CHOPPER] But if you wanted to
you could stop by here again--

408
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:23,083
[LUFFY]
Shut up! Let's go!

409
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:29,923
[CHOPPER crying]

410
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,499
[CHOPPER] Luffy's the one
who took me out to sea.

411
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:40,934
I was happy to follow
him anywhere.

412
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:44,471
[CHOPPER] But what have
I done to help him?

413
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:53,980
[CHOPPER] I don't want to
go through that again, ever.

414
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,885
It hurt, but I think maybe...

415
00:21:57,918 --> 00:22:01,388
[CHOPPER gasping]

416
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,823
[BROOK screams]

417
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:04,758
[inaudible]

418
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,360
[SANJI groans]

419
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:08,095
[inaudible]

420
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,730
[USOPP screams]

421
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,798
[inaudible]

422
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,400
[ZORO groans]

423
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:16,103
[inaudible]

424
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:19,573
[CHOPPER] I think it must've
hurt Luffy more than any of us!

425
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:25,379
[CHOPPER] Now that I
have friends like him,

426
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:27,648
it doesn't matter
what people say!

427
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,150
It doesn't matter
if they're scared of me!

428
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,059
So, if Luffy's in
trouble or he's sad...

429
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:44,364
...I'll be a monster or whatever
else it takes to help him!

430
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:46,200
[LUFFY]
Chopper!

431
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:48,436
Chopper.

432
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:50,136
Chopper!

433
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:57,745
[crying]

434
00:22:57,778 --> 00:23:01,215
Luffy!

435
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:04,852
I swear, I'm gonna get stronger!

436
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:08,355
I'm gonna be there
for you this time!

437
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:17,064
[NARRATOR] As Luffy's message
reaches Weatheria and Baldimore,

438
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:18,565
Nami and Franky decide to plot

439
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:20,935
a new course of
action for themselves.

440
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:23,871
Meanwhile, Sanji discovers
that the Kamabakka Kingdom

441
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,939
may have something
valuable to offer him,

442
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:28,308
as long as he's willing
to fight for it.

443
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:30,244
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

444
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:33,647
"Living Through Hell!
Sanji's Fight for His Manhood!"

445
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,216
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
