1
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,189
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,859
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,327
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,330
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,998
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,768
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,336
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,505
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,342
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,911
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,311
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:02,315
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,985
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,422
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:11,658
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:16,496
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,502
[NARRATOR] A long time ago
in the waters of the East Blue,

18
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,439
there were three boys who
dreamed of becoming pirates.

19
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:28,609
Seven years after
Sabo's short-lived voyage,

20
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:31,311
Ace followed him to sea.

21
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:34,181
See you soon.
Keep training hard!

22
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,283
[ACE chuckles]

23
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,517
[NARRATOR]
Three years after that,

24
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,587
Luffy departed from
his hometown, Windmill Village,

25
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,956
with his heart full of dreams.

26
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,326
[LUFFY] Sabo was first,
and Ace was second.

27
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,096
I may be the last to go,
but I'm gonna be the best!

28
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,597
I'm comin' for you, Ace!

29
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,200
And all my special
moves work now, too!

30
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,635
[NARRATOR]
But after the death of Ace,

31
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:58,305
Luffy's optimism from
that day is nowhere in sight.

32
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,609
Me? King of the Pirates?

33
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,345
What a joke!

34
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,946
I'm useless.

35
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,349
I'm so...

36
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:11,384
I'm so weak!

37
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,624
[LUFFY] "I Want to See Them!
Luffy's Mournful Cry!"

38
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,629
[PIRATE A laughs]
Anyone who stands between us

39
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,765
and the Grand Line
is getting wrecked!

40
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,868
And we're starting with
the chumps on that island!

41
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,505
[GARP]
Ready the cannonballs.

42
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,441
Meteor Fist Shower!

43
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,676
Heads up, scumbags!

44
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,146
[PIRATES screaming]

45
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,186
[DADAN grunts]

46
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,122
I... think you've
had enough today.

47
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,457
[DADAN grunts]

48
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,760
[BANDIT A]
It's Garp!

49
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,830
[BANDIT B] Garp is back and
he brought his battleship!

50
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:57,464
[BANDIT C]
Should we run?

51
00:04:59,166 --> 00:04:59,833
[gasps]

52
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,475
[MAN H] I read about the battle
at Marineford in the paper!

53
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,744
Congratulations on your victory!

54
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,913
[GARP] Word travels
fast these days, huh?

55
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,548
[MAN I]
Is Luffy okay?

56
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:15,683
Now that Whitebeard's dead,

57
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,585
the pirates are
going out of control.

58
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,186
Is that why you're here?

59
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,554
Things have gotten bad.

60
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,858
We're afraid to go out. They're
like vultures staring us down.

61
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:25,993
I don't mean to complain,

62
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,662
but I'm afraid they could
invade any second now.

63
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,996
Not likely!

64
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,734
I just sunk three of 'em with
cannonballs on the way out here.

65
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,535
Really? Whew!

66
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,372
[GARP] Eh, they we're nothing
but a bunch of blowhards.

67
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,207
All bark and no bite.

68
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,343
But seas are gonna be
tense the world over

69
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,912
without Whitebeard
to scare off all the thugs.

70
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:48,082
Even if that's not
the Navy's "official" stance.

71
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,551
Anyway, since you're
so far from our base,

72
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,419
I prepared a little something.

73
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:53,053
See?

74
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,120
[MARINES]
Sir!

75
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,358
[MAN J] "Security by
Navy Vice Admiral Garp"?

76
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,093
That'll scare 'em off for sure!

77
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:03,563
[WOMAN A] One look at that
and they'll straighten right up!

78
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,333
While you're here,
there's one more problem.

79
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,535
A bunch of mountain bandits
came down to the village.

80
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,504
They took over Makino's bar
and they aren't leaving.

81
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,873
[GARP]
That so?

82
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,508
[MAKINO]
Please! Calm down!

83
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,714
[DADAN]
Hello, Garp!

84
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,582
Hey, that's one right there!

85
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,053
[DADAN]
How dare you show your face here

86
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,489
after what you've done!

87
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,055
[MARINES, CROWD gasp]

88
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,490
[MAN K]
Garp!

89
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,226
That's not good!

90
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,093
[MARINES]
Vice Admiral!

91
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:38,131
[panting]

92
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,836
Back off, men. She's a friend.

93
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:43,971
[MARINES]
Huh?

94
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,839
[DADAN panting]

95
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,375
[DADAN]
The hell I am!

96
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,645
You were right with
them on that battlefield!

97
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:55,549
Those poor boys and you didn't
do a damn thing to help them!

98
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,917
Why did you have
me raise Ace? Huh?

99
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,853
Why did you have
me take care of them

100
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,623
if it was going to end this way?

101
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:07,862
[gasps]

102
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,697
[grunts]

103
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,334
You stood there and
watched that boy die!

104
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,971
You care more about your
damn job than your family!

105
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,540
"The great hero of the Navy"!

106
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:22,977
I hope you're proud of yourself,
you heartless piece of crap!

107
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,713
[MAGRA]
Now, now, Boss. Take it easy!

108
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:28,683
[DADAN]
Say something, you bastard!

109
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:29,717
Why didn't you help him?

110
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,886
Why didn't you do something?

111
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,655
Look me right in the face!

112
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,390
You spineless wretch!

113
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,759
You answer me, dammit!

114
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,594
Dadan! Enough!

115
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,532
[MAKINO]
Mm-mm.

116
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,535
Makino...

117
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,674
[panting]

118
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:06,386
[DADAN panting]

119
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,921
How do you think he feels?

120
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,657
He's their grandfather.
He's suffering, too!

121
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:13,760
He was right there and
he couldn't do a thing!

122
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,672
You're wrong.

123
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,009
[DADAN]
"Garp is suffering"?

124
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:31,711
No.

125
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,082
[DADAN] The only one
who's really suffering here

126
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,783
is Luffy, damn it.

127
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,759
[MAKINO]
Okay, since you asked so nicely,

128
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,695
let's learn some manners today!

129
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:49,930
Thank you for the lesson.

130
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:52,165
Hah! Nice one. Wow!

131
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,067
[ACE]
Heh.

132
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,268
[MAKINO]
Well, close.

133
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,136
Since we haven't
actually started,

134
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,140
you should say,
"thank you in advance."

135
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:00,941
Really? That was wrong?

136
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:03,043
I dunno. Sounded
pretty polite to me.

137
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,913
That may be true, but it's
a special situation.

138
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,048
So, every detail
has to be perfect.

139
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:10,017
After all, Ace wants
to pay respects

140
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,019
to a very impressive captain.

141
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,654
A friend of yours.

142
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,188
Y'mean Shanks?

143
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,156
Yep!

144
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,858
But by the time
I get to meet him,

145
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,659
I'll be a captain myself.

146
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,728
As a pirate and
as your big brother,

147
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,764
I gotta thank him
for saving your life

148
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,733
or we're both gonna
end up looking bad.

149
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,802
'Kay, so let's pretend Shanks
is here with you right now.

150
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,337
What do you say?

151
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,673
[ACE] Hi. I'm Ace.
Who the hell are you?

152
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,209
Boo!

153
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,645
I know you're pirates, but I
don't think he'd be impressed.

154
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:40,046
Yeah! Be way more cool!

155
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:44,518
Fancy meeting you here.

156
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:45,553
Boo.

157
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:46,754
[gasps]

158
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:49,356
Trash talk! Trash talk!

159
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,258
Hey, punk! What's your deal?

160
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,559
Boo!

161
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,695
Mister? What's your deal?

162
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,764
[MAKINO]
Boo!

163
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,566
'Cause he didn't say "punk"?

164
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,766
[MAKINO]
Nope! Nope!

165
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,871
[laughs] Luffy, stop!
You're distracting poor Ace!

166
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,673
Go be stupid somewhere else.
We're learning here!

167
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:07,908
You little pest!

168
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,543
I'm not distracting!

169
00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:10,678
Oh, yeah!

170
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,212
I found an anaconda nest

171
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,715
filled with a bunch of eggs
and they're super huge!

172
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,517
Let's grab 'em and cook 'em up!

173
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,719
What? Man, that sounds awesome!

174
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,321
No, not right now.

175
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:21,755
Aww...

176
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,690
[ACE] I'm gonna learn some
manners even if it kills me!

177
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,191
[LUFFY]
I can't go on my own!

178
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,661
What if the anaconda
mom finds me?

179
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,230
But if you're there with me,
we can beat it for sure!

180
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:30,998
C'mon, let's go!

181
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:32,766
[ACE]
I said no!

182
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,705
Luffy loved Ace more than
anything in the world.

183
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:48,215
[MAKINO crying]

184
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,249
Makino!

185
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,355
[MAYOR]
Hey, Garp.

186
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,522
What happened to Luffy?

187
00:10:55,556 --> 00:10:58,859
The newspaper said he
went missing after the war.

188
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,760
That he did.

189
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,668
A submarine carried him away.

190
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,239
The Admirals attacked and tried
to stop him from escaping,

191
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,742
and afterwards,
they held a search,

192
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,979
but they couldn't find
a single trace of him.

193
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:22,649
There was no shipwreck,
so he's probably alive.

194
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,584
[CROWD sighs]

195
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:24,852
That's a relief!

196
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,920
Wait, so what's up
with this bandit?

197
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,989
She obviously seems
to know Garp,

198
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,258
but why did he let her
punch him like that?

199
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,459
Yeah.

200
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:41,167
[DADAN] Luffy's been a little
moron since the day I met him,

201
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,704
but no matter what he does,
I'm always on his side.

202
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:50,811
[DADAN] As much as I'm hurting,
I know he's got it worse,

203
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,746
and it breaks my heart.

204
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,657
[DADAN]
Luffy!

205
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:06,360
I know things
are hard right now,

206
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,563
but don't you dare give up!

207
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,340
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, far away
and far along the Grand Line

208
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,310
in a place known
as the New World.

209
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,373
Shanks...

210
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,044
I don't know how I can
ever thank you enough.

211
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,350
No need to make
a big deal out of it.

212
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:03,950
Whitebeard was a rival,

213
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,820
but I still held a lot
of respect for the man.

214
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,592
[SHANKS]
Even Sengoku felt that way.

215
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,864
[SHANKS]
As for Whitebeard and Ace,

216
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,698
I'm sure you won't
object to their friends

217
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,601
taking care of the burial.

218
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:24,538
That's enough! Let me
take responsibility.

219
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:32,246
Well, I suppose it's
time for us to go.

220
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,247
Yeah, thank you again.

221
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:39,253
[SHANKS] I can only imagine
how tough this is on Luffy.

222
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:43,423
Even so, his brother
died like a true man.

223
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,093
Take it back or else.

224
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:50,864
You don't know anything about
the man who saved my life!

225
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:54,267
This is his era.
Don't you forget it!

226
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:02,108
[SHANKS] Maybe Ace
wouldn't want to hear this,

227
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:05,212
but that's exactly what
Captain Roger would've done.

228
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,949
[SHANKS]
There were times when I wished

229
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,117
he wasn't too bold
to run away...

230
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,455
[SHANKS]
Too bold to shed tears.

231
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:22,362
[SHANKS]
Listen, Luffy.

232
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:27,401
It's not only victory that
makes a man, but defeat.

233
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,170
Joy and sorrow alike.

234
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,606
There's no shame
in backing down.

235
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,784
[SHANKS]
There's no shame in crying...

236
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,656
[SHANKS]
...so long as you overcome it.

237
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,489
[LUFFY]
Damn it!

238
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:26,460
I couldn't save
my crew or my brother!

239
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:30,364
Why? Why? Why?

240
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,333
Why am I so weak?

241
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,568
Damn it! Damn it!

242
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,770
I'm useless!

243
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:44,844
Luffy.

244
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:47,447
[LUFFY]
Go away!

245
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,651
[LUFFY]
Leave me alone!

246
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:51,785
[JIMBEI]
I cannot.

247
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,521
Although I understand your pain,

248
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:56,323
I will not allow you
to hurt yourself any more.

249
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:59,326
It's not your business!

250
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,028
This is my body!

251
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,496
[JIMBEI]
What of Ace, then?

252
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,232
Who sacrificed his
body to protect you?

253
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,368
Was that none of your business?

254
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,269
You bastard. Shut up!

255
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,439
Say one more word and
I'm gonna crush you!

256
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,476
If that would make you happy,
then why don't you try?

257
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,079
But let me warn you,
injured though I am,

258
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:19,647
you will not defeat me.

259
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,315
Not in that condition!

260
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:24,384
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

261
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,288
[JIMBEI growls]

262
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,496
[panting]

263
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,268
[panting]

264
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,174
[panting]

265
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,346
[ACE]
Let me tell you something.

266
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:56,783
A while back, when I
was hunting down Teach,

267
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:58,619
I went to Alabasta Kingdom

268
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:03,156
and I saw my brother for the
first time in three years.

269
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:07,294
As soon as I saw his face,
a weight lifted from my heart.

270
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:10,297
And do you know why?

271
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,003
[yells]

272
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:17,938
Ow! Are you insane?

273
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,539
Stop! Luffy!

274
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:22,643
I've had enough
of your nonsense!

275
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:25,279
[LUFFY yells]

276
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:26,479
[JIMBEI grunts]

277
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,986
Boy, you can't see
a thing. You're blind.

278
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,988
You never doubted your strength,

279
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:37,458
but now the confidence
that once allowed you

280
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:40,327
to soar above the clouds
has been shattered.

281
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,362
Your brother, who was
your guiding light,

282
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:45,999
has faded away,
and your enemies stand so tall

283
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,935
and cast so great a shadow,
that you can do naught

284
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:50,837
but cower in the darkness.

285
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:53,340
And now, you strike
out like an animal

286
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:56,176
at the cage your doubt
has placed around you.

287
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,647
Hate to tell you though,

288
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,415
you're still not
strong enough to beat me.

289
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,489
So, you're smarter
than you look.

290
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,961
Now fire, Pacifistas!

291
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:20,734
[KIZARU]
Huh.

292
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,705
[LUFFY yelling]

293
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:29,977
Struggle all you like,

294
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,846
but you're trapped in
the palm of my hand!

295
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,329
[JIMBEI] So long as you are
consumed by regret and guilt,

296
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:52,866
you will never find
your way forward!

297
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,505
Luffy, your pain may be great,
but it mustn't devour you!

298
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:01,409
There is yet joy
beyond your sorrows!

299
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:03,577
What's gone may be gone,

300
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,380
but you still have something
left in this world to treasure.

301
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:07,948
Don't you?!

302
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:55,496
[ZORO grunting]

303
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,298
Hey, you wanna screw around?

304
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:58,699
Go do it somewhere else.

305
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:01,001
I'm tryin' to build muscle here!

306
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:08,842
Luffy! We've got a big
storm on the horizon!

307
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,677
Make preparations, quick!

308
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,815
[USOPP] I had a big one!
You just missed it!

309
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:17,851
But the next one is
gonna be even bigger!

310
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:21,855
Scram!

311
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:25,459
I'm almost done!
Just keep your pants on!

312
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:28,029
It's okay. No matter
how bad you're hurt,

313
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:29,363
you're in good hands!

314
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,299
By the way, this one
might sting a little bit.

315
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,305
Oh, Luffy!

316
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:41,141
If you like treasure,
this research is fascinating!

317
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:42,375
Come see!

318
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,313
What's up, buddy?

319
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:47,914
If you're checkin'
on the cola engine,

320
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:49,516
it's in super shape.

321
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,784
Wow!

322
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:54,087
And if you're checkin' on
me, well, I'm super, too!

323
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,255
[BROOK]
Good morning, Captain!

324
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,690
Rise and shine!

325
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,826
How about I play
you a little song?

326
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,727
Really get those bones moving!

327
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,529
[BROOK laughs]

328
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,172
Luffy.

329
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:12,973
Luffy!

330
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,508
Luffy!

331
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,976
Luffy.

332
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,079
Luffy!

333
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:19,513
Luffy.

334
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,481
Luffy!

335
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,483
Captain Luffy!

336
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:25,485
[ALL]
Luffy!

337
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:31,291
[LUFFY crying]

338
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,826
[JIMBEI]
Hmm?

339
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:39,367
My crew...

340
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,435
I still have my crew!

341
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:46,473
Zoro, Nami, Usopp,
Sanji, Chopper, Robin,

342
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,742
Franky, and Brook!

343
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:52,279
They're still out there,
waiting for me!

344
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,849
[sighs] Now do you see?

345
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:57,351
[LUFFY] I have to
get back to the ship

346
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,653
no matter how long it takes me.

347
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:03,523
Guys! Meet back on
the Sunny in three days!

348
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:04,758
[ALL]
Roger!

349
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:09,429
[LUFFY] Everything's a
mess and I'm already late,

350
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:12,333
but I have to make
it back to Sabaody.

351
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:14,802
I know they'll be there.

352
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:17,338
[ACE] It wasn't just
knowing he was safe,

353
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:19,873
or seeing him smile again...

354
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:24,678
When you've got a bungling
kid brother like me...

355
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:28,916
...ya can't help
but worry a bit.

356
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:32,185
He might be a bit much
for all of you to handle,

357
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,321
but take good care
of him for me.

358
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,325
[ACE] I mean, sure,
he wasn't the snot-nosed kid

359
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:42,329
following me around anymore,
but more than that...

360
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,897
He had friends...

361
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:49,302
A crew that he could depend on.

362
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:55,142
No matter what,
he'll be just fine,

363
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:57,811
so I don't have
to worry anymore.

364
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:04,084
[LUFFY]
I wish they were here right now.

365
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:05,419
I miss them.

366
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:09,189
I miss my crew!

367
00:23:16,363 --> 00:23:18,165
[NARRATOR]
Luffy thinks of his friends

368
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:20,200
scattered across the seas.

369
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,501
Involved in their own struggles,

370
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:24,238
they all search for ways
to return to Sabaody.

371
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:26,406
When news from the War
of the Best reaches them,

372
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:29,476
they realize the situation
is even more complicated

373
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:30,443
than they feared.

374
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:32,346
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

375
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:36,083
"Straw Hats in Shock!
The Bad News Has Reached Them!"

376
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:38,618
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
