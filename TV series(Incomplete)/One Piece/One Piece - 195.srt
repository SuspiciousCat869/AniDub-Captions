00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:50,790
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,250
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,919
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,588
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,091
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:04,554
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:10,268
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:18,109
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow</i>

9
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:22,739
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:25,909
<i>Sailed toward different dreams</i>

11
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,911
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:32,957
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see</i>

13
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:38,338
<i>And we know that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here</i>

14
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:42,342
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny</i>

15

<i>There's no looking back,</i>

00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,347
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,602
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past</i>

18
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:54,479
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:59,401
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>We know we'll get there</i>

20
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,444
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:07,200
<i>Every tear that we've cried</i>
<i>only helps our dreams come true</i>

22
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:14,249
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life</i>

23
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:21,756
<i>A glimpse of the sun rising</i>
<i>on our tomorrow!</i>

00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:24,342
[GROUP panting]

25
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:34,269
Sanji? Did we lose 'em?

26
00:02:34,352 --> 00:02:35,854
Looks like they gave up!

27
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:37,439
I don't see anyone!

28
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:38,481
Really?

29
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:40,358
Well that's good!

30
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:43,069
To be honest, their giant
cannon really scared me!

31
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:44,612
Where were they
hiding that thing,

32
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:46,948
and how come they
didn't use it against Eneru?

33
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:48,158
Their cannon?

34
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:50,452
Yeah, you know,
that huge thing the warriors

35
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:51,828
were carrying towards us?

36
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:53,038
Didn't you see it?

37
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:54,414
Oh, you mean that thing.

38
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:56,458
Yeah, that thing!
What's wrong with you?

39
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,793
It's not funny!
Why do you think we're running!

40
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:00,462
[CHOPPER]
Yeah, Robin! Usopp's right!

41
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:01,921
Don't laugh, okay?

42
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:04,341
We made it!
There's Nami and Conis!

43
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:07,510
Where? Nami! Hey, Conis!

44
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:08,595
[grunts]

45
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:15,143
[ROBIN]
Are you okay?

46
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:16,436
Oh, yeah!

47
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:21,816
[LUFFY] "Off to the Blue Sea!
A Heartfelt Finale!"

48
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,159
[CHIEFTAIN] What? They ran
away and left the island?

49
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:32,243
[ISLANDER A]
Yes.

50
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:34,496
We couldn't even
give them our gift.

51
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,039
[CHIEFTAIN]
How disappointing.

52
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,958
And after all they did for us.

53
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:42,045
I wonder if they realize how
much we appreciate them.

54
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:45,799
I agree.

55
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:47,759
They don't know how we feel.

56
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:53,932
You know, Aisa, it's not fair
that you were the only one

57
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:55,850
that got to say goodbye to them.

58
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,936
Everyone's really upset
that we let our heroes

59
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,187
just run away.

60
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,772
[AISA laughs]

61
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:04,651
Sorry! Luffy and the others made
me promise to keep it a secret!

62
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:07,237
Did you say anything
to them before they left?

63
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,447
Yeah! I said, "Thank you, all."

64
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:20,291
[AISA]
Hey, Laki? Didja see?

65
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,044
Luffy can stretch
his body really far!

66
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:25,964
He's like a "Gum-Gum Pistol!"
Kapow! Yay!

67
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,800
Aisa, please!
You've got to hold still!

68
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:30,593
I never knew there
were warriors like him

69
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:32,345
in the Blue Sea!

70
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:34,681
I wanna be just
like him when I grow up.

71
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:36,141
A Gum-Gum warrior!

72
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:39,644
[LAKI]
Aisa.

73
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:40,812
[AISA]
Hm?

74
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:42,689
I'm just going to
trim your hair a little.

75
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,566
You need to let it grow.

76
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:45,316
[AISA]
Huh?

77
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,985
Hey, it'll look good.

78
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:48,528
I think you've
forgotten you're a girl,

79
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:49,904
and girls should look cute.

80
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:52,782
What? Cute? Me?

81
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:54,868
Are you nuts?

82
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:57,078
[LAKI laughs]
I'm not!

83
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:59,372
With the war over, there's
no need for kids like you

84
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:01,041
to carry weapons anymore.

85
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:05,879
Now you can enjoy life
the way it was meant to be

86
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:09,174
and as a proper young lady.

87
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:11,593
I never knew you
were so ladylike!

88
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:13,011
[laughs]

89
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:15,180
[LAKI] Come on, Aisa!
Now hold still!

90
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:16,389
[AISA]
Laki's ladylike!

91
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:17,307
[LAKI]
Aisa!

92
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,642
[AISA, LAKI laugh]

93
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:27,525
[WYPER]
Great Warrior Kalgara.

94
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:29,361
We were told that
the Shandorians' role

95
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:30,779
has been fulfilled.

96
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:33,823
As for your last wish

97
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:36,993
it was delivered
to your best friend.

98
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:40,789
Our future generations will
no longer have to shed blood.

99
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:43,208
We are finally at peace.

100
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,793
The war may be over.

101
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:47,337
But one thing that will
never end is our pride!

102
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,881
Please continue to guide us,
Mighty Kalgara,

103
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:51,424
and watch over us as well.

104
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:57,514
We solemnly swear, The Fire
of Shandora will never die!

105
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,739
I-I cannot abandon my duties!

106
00:06:14,823 --> 00:06:16,574
I am the Sky Knight, after all.

107
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:18,993
Yes, but this land
no longer has any need

108
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:20,954
for that role.

109
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:23,790
What it does need, however,
is someone who can govern it.

110
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:26,626
Someone who is kind and just.

111
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,089
I believe that duty
is best suited for you.

112
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:33,425
Perhaps you should
be looking at yourself.

113
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:36,553
Remember, this city originally
belonged to your people.

114
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:38,513
[CHIEFTAIN]
It did, long ago.

115
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:40,724
But that means nothing now.

116
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:44,352
In fact, with this battle, all
of us realized something.

117
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:46,229
Vearth belongs to no group.

118
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:48,606
It must be shared.

119
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,984
Our world has two sides.

120
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,069
The land is called Skypiea.

121
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:55,155
The city, Shandora.

122
00:06:55,238 --> 00:06:58,158
They have been torn
asunder by war for ages.

123
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:00,535
Only a man who has
long lamented that war

124
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:03,580
can unite them,
and that man is you.

125
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:07,667
So Sky Knight, Gan Fall.

126
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:10,628
I'd like you to take
Skypiea's throne again.

127
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:12,839
Only you can heal
the deep wounds

128
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:15,925
that scar this land of ours.

129
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,552
We'd like you
to do it, too, sir!

130
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:18,845
Gan Fall, please!

131
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:21,056
We Shandorians are
behind you all the way

132
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:22,390
Yeah!

133
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:23,892
[SHANDORIAN C]
Gan Fall!

134
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:24,893
[ISLANDER B]
Our god!

135
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:26,227
[ISLANDER C]
Please come back!

136
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:37,238
[GAN FALL]
Well, well.

137
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:39,783
And here I was thinking
that I'd finally be able

138
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:43,328
to get some rest and
tend to my pumpkin patch.

139
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:48,416
[CROWD cheering]

140
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:11,564
Okay! We're almost there!

141
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:14,526
Everyone! See that up ahead?

142
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:15,735
That's Cloud End!

143

[USOPP]
Whoa, lemme see!

144
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:19,114
[LUFFY]
Huh.

145
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:20,990
So that's where we
go back down from?

146
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:22,992
[USOPP] We got here
sooner than I thought.

147
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:27,872
Aww. We really have
to go back already?

148
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:29,791
You know, it sounds crazy,

149
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:31,668
but I'm actually gonna
miss this place.

150
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:34,212
I think it's time we said
goodbye to the White Sea.

151
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:36,381
[CHOPPER]
Sky island sure is fun.

152
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:38,299
But scary, too.

153
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:39,509
[USOPP]
We just go through that gate,

154
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:41,011
and there'll be a Milky
Road that'll take us

155
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:43,513
to the Blue Sea, huh?

156
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:45,890
[NAMI] Wonder if we'll ever
visit this place again.

157
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:47,684
Well, you never know.

158
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:50,729
[horn playing reveille]

159
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:59,863
[PAGAYA] I'm sorry, but this
is as far as we can go!

160

We will! Thanks for the escort!

to the others for us!

166

It was nice meeting you guys!

[PAGAYA, CONIS]
Bye!

176

Now take in your sails,
and hold on tight!

177
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:33,563
You're in for a bumpy ride!

178
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:36,107
Right! Let's do as the man says!

179
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:38,109
It feels like we're
already picking up speed!

180
00:09:38,193 --> 00:09:40,028
[LUFFY] Yeah, and we're sliding
down from thousands of feet

181
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:41,905
in the air! Hurry up!

182
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:42,906

Aye!

188
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,292
He says,
"Don't leave without me."

00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:55,543
[NAMI]
Oh.

190
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:57,754
That's the Southbird we
brought up here with us.

191
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:03,802
[NAMI] Captain! It looks like
the log pose has the coordinates

192
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:05,261
for the next island!

193
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,265
Great! Let's go!

194
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:10,975
Once we get to the bottom,
we're gonna start

195
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:12,560
a brand-new adventure!

196
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:14,646
Who's up for finding some gold?

197
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:16,731
Guys! Get ready!

198
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:21,528

00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,919
Everyone grab hold of something!

203
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:40,130
The freefall's about to start!

207
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:04,821
Just hang on!

00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:07,824

Octopus!

[NAMI]
Oh! Oh, that hurt.

214
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:31,765
What... happened?

215
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:37,729
Hey, guys! Get a load of this!

216
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:42,567
[ZORO]
What the hell is it?

217
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,610
[CHOPPER]
A balloon!

218
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:46,071
[LUFFY laughs]
Yeah! Ain't it great?

219
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:47,447
[NAMI]
We're not falling!

220
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,740
[USOPP]
Oh, good!

221
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:50,992
For a minute there,
I thought we were goners!

222
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:52,160
All of us!

00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:54,454

[MCKINLEY]
Keep ringing it!

228
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:24,025
Let the departing
heroes of this land

229
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:26,277
know how much
we appreciate them!

Heso!

Luffy! Come back soon!

233
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,577
[ISLANDER A]
You're always welcome!

234
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:36,079
[ISLANDER B]
Thank you so much!

235
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:38,748
[SHANDORIAN D] We wish you
safe passage to the Blue Sea!

236
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:40,834
[CROWD chattering]

237
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:50,176
[NARRATOR] When you look up,
you see the sky.

238
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,804
Though some believe
it to be only a legend,

239
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:55,306
there is an island
floating thousands of feet

240
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,766
in the air.

241
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,560
If you listen carefully,

242
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:01,521
you can hear the
tolling of a bell.

243
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:05,275
It rings today, and it
will ring again tomorrow.

244
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:07,944
That bell rings
from the heavens,

245
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:10,572
from a land that wandered.

246
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:13,158
It sings of its pride,
and proclaims

247
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:18,079
to the rest of the world,
"We are here."

248
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,622
[LUFFY laughs]

249
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:21,207
This is so great!

250
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,542
[USOPP]
Tell me about it!

251
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,295
What a way to travel!
I love it!

252
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,023
[SHOJO]
You're calling off the search?

253
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:46,483
[CRICKET]
Of course.

254
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:48,526
The City of Gold has been
in the sky this whole time.

255
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,237
There's nothing else to be
found at the bottom of the sea.

256
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:54,616
Sorry, fellas.
This dream's over.

257
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:56,868
No point in staying
here anymore.

258
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:58,536
Old man.

259
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,497
Cricket.

260
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,332
[CRICKET] I wanna thank
all of you for helping me

261
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:04,751
pursue my dream
for all of these years.

262
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,836
You never stopped believing.

263
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,004
That means a lot.

264
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:09,339
[MASIRA]
Does this mean...

265
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:11,966
[SHOJO]
...you're leaving the Alliance?

266
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,176
[CRICKET]
Hey, guys.

267
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,721
Since this dream's done,

268
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:18,515
which one are we
gonna pursue next?

270
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:28,358

the ends of the earth, Old Man!

271
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:29,150

Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold!

274
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,327
[LUFFY laughs]
We finally struck it rich!

275
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,663
What should we buy
with all this loot?

276
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:44,874
Hey! I know!
A huge bronze statue!

277
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,167
Moron!

278
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,211
Only an idiot would
exchange gold for bronze!

279
00:14:48,294 --> 00:14:49,337
How stupid!

280
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,089
What we need are more cannons!

281
00:14:51,172 --> 00:14:52,590
Ten of them! Ten!

282
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:55,468
[SANJI] Nami, I want to buy
a refrigerator with a lock!

283
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:56,761
[LUFFY]
Uh-uh!

284
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:58,138
If you get one with a lock,
there'll be no way

285
00:14:58,221 --> 00:14:59,472
for me to get a midnight snack!

286
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:01,850
[SANJI] That's exactly why
I want one, you pig!

287
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:04,269
[NAMI] Would you guys
just hold on a second?

288
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:05,812
We need to land first.

289
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:07,897
Then we can divide
up the treasure.

290
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:10,275
Please buy me books!

291
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:12,193
If we buy everything
you guys want,

292
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:14,529
we're gonna be broke
again in no time.

293
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:16,448
[ROBIN]
Miss Navigator?

294
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:17,490
The ship.

295
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:19,451
Just where is it headed exactly?

296
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:22,037
Where else?
The next island, of course.

297
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,166
[NAMI screams]

298
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:27,917
--You okay?
--What's wrong?

299
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:30,545
Need a hug, Nami?

300
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:35,008
[NAMI]
Dammit!

301
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:38,845
We've been blown off course!
We must have hit an air current!

302
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:39,846
[USOPP]
Huh?

303
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:41,848
Well, I definitely
feel a breeze.

304
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:43,141
Is that a bad thing?

305
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:44,684
Of course it is!

306
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:47,937
Now we have no idea where we
are or where we're gonna land!

307
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,356
And with the octopus up there,

308
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:52,192
we can't set the sails
or control the ship.

309
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:53,485
What are we gonna do?

310
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:55,028
Hey, don't worry about it.

311
00:15:55,111 --> 00:15:57,197
Once we touch down, we'll just
head to the next island,

312
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,573
easy as that!

313
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:01,451

off at the mouth as always.

Nah. Guess I was wrong.

00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,671
No. Never mind.

00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:21,596
Oh, yeah, it was just a dream.

Thanks for scaring us!

323
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:26,017

you for that! I swear!

326
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,367
The sun's completely set now.

327
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,661
It's still a nice view.

You're right. It really is.

Uh, mornin'.

00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:50,125
It's still evening, dummy.

331
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,877
This is taking longer
than I expected.

332
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:54,254
[NAMI]
I agree.

333
00:16:54,337 --> 00:16:56,423
I'm really worried about
how far we've drifted.

334
00:16:56,506 --> 00:16:57,716
We could be anywhere.

335
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,759
[SANJI] What if I sang
you girls a romantic song

336
00:16:59,843 --> 00:17:00,969
to take your mind off th--?

00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:02,554

339
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,724
You know what?

340
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,642
I betcha we get blown
all the way to Raftel!

341
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,561
Do you really think so?

342
00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:10,687
[ROBIN]
Uh, guys?

343
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,689
Unfortunately,
that's impossible.

344
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:14,524
We'd have to sail
across more than half

345
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:16,568
the Grand Line
just to get there.

346
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:20,405
[USOPP]
Uh... Yeah, um, I knew that.

347
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:23,491
This conversation's boring.

348
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,744
How much longer
is this gonna take?

349
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,454
Go to sleep.

00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:28,872
[LUFFY]
Hey, Zoro!

00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:31,541
If you're really bored,
I've got something you can do,

00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:32,751
and it's fun!

353
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,377
Uh? Luffy?

354
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:36,046
Where'd his voice come from?

355
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:38,882
Good question.
He did sound kinda far off.

356
00:17:38,965 --> 00:17:41,009
Luffy! Where are you?

357
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:44,262
[LUFFY]
I'm up here! C'mon, guys!

358
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:47,474
This thing's a blast!
[laughing]

359
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:50,101
What? Is he nuts?

360
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:54,606
[LUFFY laughs]
Whee! Awesome!

361
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:57,359
This is awesome!
[laughing]

362
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,361
Hey, don't do anything stupid!

363
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:01,321
All our lives depend
on this balloon!

364
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:02,947
You hear me, Luffy?

365
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:05,825
[LUFFY]
Don't worry! Don't worry!

366
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:15,794
[SANJI]
Luffy, stop! Get down!

367
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:16,878
Right now!

368
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:19,422
Sanji, what are
you yelling about?

369
00:18:19,506 --> 00:18:20,924
[SANJI]
The octopus is shrinking!

370
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:22,967
If we don't do anything,
we'll fall!

371
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,094
[NAMI]
Huh?

372
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:25,970
[SANJI]
Hey, Luffy!

373
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:26,971
What's that? Huh?

374
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:28,848
[NAMI]
The octopus is shrinking!

375
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:30,016
Shrinking?!

376
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,351
You know, now that I look at it,

377
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:34,562
it does look smaller
than it did before.

378
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,897
[NAMI]
What are we gonna do?

379
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,066
We're still really
high up in the air!

380
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:42,320
[SANJI]
Luffy! Something's wrong!

381
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:44,030
You've gotta come down now!

382
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,867
[LUFFY yelps]

383
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:52,622
[LUFFY, SANJI yelling]

384
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:53,832
[GROUP]
Huh?!

385
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:01,047
[laughing]

386
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:02,298
That was scary!

387
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:04,759
Wonder why the octopus
isn't bouncy anymore.

388
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,637
[SANJI] I told you,
it's shrinking, bonehead!

389
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:12,475
[LUFFY]
Huh?

390
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,894
[LUFFY]
Uh... That's weird.

391
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:17,230
How'd the ship get below us?

392
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:21,818
[USOPP] Agh!
We're falling! We're falling!

393
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:24,571
We're gonna hit the sea so hard,
we'll sink to the bottom!

394
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:26,573
Only if the ship
doesn't shatter first!

395
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:28,366
Shatter? No way!

396
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,535
Usopp, what are you gonna do?

397
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:31,870
[USOPP]
What I always do!

398
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:33,621
Save our lives, of course!

399
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:37,667
[USOPP grunting]

400
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:38,877
What are you doing?

401
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,754
[SANJI]
Don't be crazy, Usopp!

402
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:43,673
[USOPP]
Usopp...

403
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:45,717
[yells]

404
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,801
[GROUP]
Huh?!

405
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,178
[USOPP yelling]

406
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:52,265
[USOPP yelling]

407
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:54,809
Hey! Look, it worked!

408
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:55,852
All right.

409
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:57,020
Come on, now.

410
00:19:57,103 --> 00:19:59,147
Breath dials! Do your thing!

411
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:04,652
Now float! Float, I say!

412
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,779
[yelps]

413
00:20:12,535 --> 00:20:13,495
We've slowed down.

414
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:14,829
All right!

415
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,331
Are we safe now?

416
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:17,999
It sure seems like it.

417
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,292
[USOPP laughs]

418
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:21,711
Just leave it all up
to Usopp to save the day!

419
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:24,339
[CHOPPER]
Usopp, you're so brave!

420
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:25,548
[LUFFY laughs]

421
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:27,759
I was actually scared
there for a second!

422
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:28,843
[NAMI]
Me, too!

423
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,679
Looks like we're finally safe!

424
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:34,599
Or not!

425
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:37,519
[GROUP yelling]

426
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:38,812
[LUFFY]
Usopp!

427
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:46,236
[LUFFY]
Everybody hold onto something!

428
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,905
[GROUP yelling]

429
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:57,956
[CHOPPER, USOPP grunting]

430
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,625
[LUFFY]
Agh! That's cold!

431
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:03,003
[SANJI]
Nami! Robin! Are you okay?

432
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:07,382
[NAMI]
That was really scary!

433
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:09,009
What happened to the octopus?

434
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:10,760
[ROBIN]
Guess it ran out of air.

435
00:21:10,844 --> 00:21:12,595
[SANJI]
Wonder how that happened.

436
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,267
[LUFFY]
Hey, come on!

437
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,812
Don't whine.
We did make it down here alive!

438
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:21,896
You're right.

439
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:28,028
And we got to see
an incredible place.

440
00:21:30,363 --> 00:21:33,199
[ROBIN] Now that we're down
here, it looks so far away.

441
00:21:33,283 --> 00:21:35,035
[NAMI]
Like something out of a dream.

442
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:36,828
It's a dreamland.

443
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:38,538
Think we'll see it again?

444
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:41,332
Well, you might see some
place similar when you die.

445
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,375
Not you.

446
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:44,461
I doubt you're going
any place good!

447
00:21:44,544 --> 00:21:45,795
You jerk!

448
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:48,131
[SANJI] You guys keep
discussing the afterlife.

449
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:50,383
Me? I'm gonna go
put on a pot of coffee.

450
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,093
[LUFFY]
Make dinner instead, Sanji!

451
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,386
[SANJI]
Are you ever not hungry?

452
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,097
Have some coffee first
and be patient, will ya!

453
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,432
[LUFFY]
Okay.

454
00:21:58,224 --> 00:21:59,476
Hey, by the way...

455
00:22:01,936 --> 00:22:05,940
[sirens blaring]

456
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:19,871
[LUFFY]
...does anybody know...

457
00:22:19,954 --> 00:22:22,332
...just where the heck we are?

458
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:31,675
<i>When you're lost and alone,</i>
<i>I can always hear your voice</i>

459
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:36,846
<i>While you wander far from home,</i>
<i>gazing up at the sky</i>

460
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,599
<i>You are just like the moon</i>

461
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:44,396
<i>You never change as</i>
<i>you climb into the night</i>

462
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:52,862
<i>But your reflection wanes,</i>
<i>then you disappear,</i>

463
00:22:52,946 --> 00:22:56,866
<i>fading so suddenly...</i>

464
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:02,122
<i>Stay as you are,</i>
<i>don't lose your way</i>

465
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:11,047
<i>Let these words guide you,</i>
<i>don't ever look back!</i>

466
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:15,468
<i>Don't give up on your dreams,</i>

467
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:17,262
<i>they come to you</i>

468
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:22,726
<i>Again and again, until you</i>
<i>see them shining through!</i>

469
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:28,606
<i>You may not return,</i>
<i>I hope that you'll learn</i>

470
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:35,321
<i>to put your past behind,</i>
<i>and just keep moving on</i>

471
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:44,831
[CHOPPER]
Where are we?

472
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:46,249
[NAMI] What are all
these spotlights for?

473
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:47,375
[USOPP]
My one-man show?

474
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,543
[LUFFY]
Moron!

475
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:50,086
[ZORO] An emergency siren!
That means...!

476
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,547
[SANJI] I can't believe we
landed here of all places!

477
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,924
[ROBIN] The first thing we need
to do is get off the ship!

478
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:57,260
[LUFFY]
Hey! What about dinner?

479
00:23:57,344 --> 00:23:58,845
On the next One Piece!

480
00:23:58,928 --> 00:24:01,014
"A State of Emergency is Issued!

481
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:03,850
A Notorious Pirate Ship
Has Infiltrated!"

482
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:06,561
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
