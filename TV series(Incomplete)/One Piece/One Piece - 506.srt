such an awful slump?

357
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:24,318
Is this my punishment
for all those panties?

358
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:27,254
[gasps] Oh, my.

359
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:32,359
[ZORO grunting]

360
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:35,596
[MIHAWK] Save your
strength, Roronoa Zoro.

361
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:38,733
Your wounds are too severe
to ignore any longer.

362
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:40,067
And to be quite frank,

363
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:43,971
you have no hope of defeating
me if you lost to those apes.

364
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:45,472
[ZORO]
Yeah, well.

365
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:48,141
What the hell are
you doin' here?

366
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,845
[MIHAWK] I've been living in
that castle for a while now.

367
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:52,947
What brings you here?

368
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,049
That would be one of
your Seven Warlords pals.

369
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,451
Kuma sent the whole crew flying.

370
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:01,655
I see. That explains
things, then.

371
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,725
Straw Hat was fighting with
a different group in Marineford.

372
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:05,693
[ZORO gasps]

373
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:07,427
Hold on, did you see Luffy?

374
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,596
Is he all right?
What was he doing?

375
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:11,565
[MIHAWK]
He should still be alive,

376
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,167
but as he left the battle,

377
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,270
he appeared to be
severely traumatized.

378
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:17,504
[ZORO]
Why's that?

379
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,276
Don't you know?

380
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,812
His brother is dead.

381
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:26,213
[ZORO gasps]

382
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:28,983
[FRANKY groans]

383
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,117
It can't be!

384
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,752
And you're certain that's true?

385
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,187
[SANJI gasping]

386
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,655
Oh, no!

387
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,823
No way. Really?

388
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,092
How can this be happening?

389
00:22:42,897 --> 00:22:45,466
I can't believe it.

390
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:50,837
Fire Fist Ace died...
right before Straw Hat's eyes.

391
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,278
[ZORO]
Luffy.

392
00:22:58,312 --> 00:22:59,980
[ALL]
Luffy!

393
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,897
[NARRATOR] Determined
to return to Sabaody and

394
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,468
keep his promise to his crew,
Luffy prepares for depature.

395
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,869
However, when Dark
King Rayleigh appears

396
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,738
and makes him
a surprising offer,

397
00:23:24,772 --> 00:23:27,474
Luffy is forced to make
a decision that could alter

398
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:30,277
the fate of his entire
journey on the Grand Line.

399
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:32,078
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

400
00:23:32,112 --> 00:23:34,247
"Reunited with
Dark King Rayleigh!

401
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,049
Decision Time for Luffy!"

402
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,752
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
