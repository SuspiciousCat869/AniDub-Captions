1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:38,241
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:40,910
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:45,582
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:50,620
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,787 --> 00:02:53,556
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,926
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,162
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:02,799
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:05,768
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:09,038
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:22,185
Behold my new weapon.
The Stag Beetle!

48
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:26,456
Hell yeah!

49
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:27,891
I'm ready whenever you are!

50
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,826
Just a word of warning.

51
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:31,928
I haven't had a chance
to test this thing.

52
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,063
So I don't know what'll
happen when I let it loose.

53
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:35,331
[FRANKY]
Roger!

54
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:38,067
Now shoot me straight into that
thing's stomach and we got this!

55
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,807
[USOPP]
Special Attack. Iron Man Comet!

56
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,310
[FRANKY]
I'm gonna wipe that smug grin

57
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:49,913
right off your face, Moria!

58
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:53,616
Tch!

59
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:01,524
Franky, no!

60
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,030
[MORIA]
Don't stop now, Oars!

61
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:09,699
That was a nice shot,
but I'm afraid he's still alive.

62
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:12,001
Why don't you stomp on him?

63
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:13,636
[OARS]
Okay.

64
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:25,882
Kushishishi!

65
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,919
[NAMI]
Thunderbolt...

66
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,588
Look! That cloud!

67
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:33,890
[NAMI]
...Tempo!

68
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:43,933
I don't know what's
going on, but I want it to stop!

69
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:46,336
Oars, can you pound
whoever's doing it?

70
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:57,246
Nami-swan!

71
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,048
Could you stop yelling already?

72
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:00,683
Now they're gonna
know where I am!

73
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,619
Okay Master. Gum-Gum...

74
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:04,487
[NAMI]
Huh?

75
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,688
Wait, he's not
gonna stretch, is he?

76
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,323
I mean, can he?

77
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:11,027
...Pistol!

78
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:16,299
[CHOPPER]
What?

79
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:27,010
He... he stretched! Impossible!

80
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:32,281
Hey, it worked!

81
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:35,151
That was new,
but it doesn't feel new.

82
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:38,187
Kushishishi!

83
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:41,858
[LUFFY] "The Straw Hat Crew
Gets Wiped Out!

84
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:44,660
The Shadow-Shadow's
Powers in Full Swing!"

85
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,665
[OARS]
Gum-Gum...

86
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:50,933
Here he comes!

87
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,068
[OARS]
...Bell!

88
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,404
[screaming]

89
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:07,116
This whole stretching
thing makes fighting fun.

90
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,885
Gum-Gum...

91
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,221
He's coming back for more!

92
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:14,924
[OARS]
...Spear!

93
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,034
What the hell's goin' on here?

94
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:27,403
He just got
exponentially more powerful!

95
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:28,938
[ZORO] It's not like
he ate a Devil Fruit,

96
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,040
so how's he able
to stretch like that?

97
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:33,242
It's gotta be Moria.
What'd he do?

98
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,952
Kushishi!

99
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:43,786
There you have it!

100
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,354
Now you know
the nightmarish power

101
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:48,324
of the Shadow-Shadow fruit!

102
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:49,992
Shadow Revolution!

103
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,866
Revolution?

104
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,267
A shadow is
a helpless prisoner

105
00:06:58,301 --> 00:06:59,969
to the body that casts it,

106
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,205
mimicking it like a reflection.

107
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:04,006
The body and shadow
are physically fused

108
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,042
to the same
shapes and movements.

109
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:08,010
It's a basic law of nature!

110
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:11,314
But I've freed Oars' shadow
from the dominance of Oars' body

111
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,484
and taken control of its
form with my own shadow!

112
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:17,420
I can now change
the shape of Oars' shadow

113
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:20,089
as I wish,
thereby forcing Oars' body

114
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:23,025
to match and follow
its every contortion!

115
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:25,962
As I said, it's a law of
nature that the body and shadow

116
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:28,097
must always hold the same shape.

117
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:31,868
But now the shadow is no longer
the subordinate, but the master!

118
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:35,838
The body is forced to obey
any shape the shadow takes!

119
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,808
This is the power
of Shadow Revolution!

120
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:40,977
Moria is even
stronger than we thought.

121
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,045
Even if Oars doesn't
have a devil fruit power,

122
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,247
he can still stretch.

123
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,983
If Moria controls his shadow,
he can rewrite the rules.

124
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,017
[SANJI]
It's a bit of cold comfort

125
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,286
to know that Oars
isn't actually a rubber man.

126
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,222
If he has all the same powers,
it doesn't do us much good.

127
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:54,957
Wasn't he tough enough already?

128
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:56,259
I mean, give us a break here.

129
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:57,360
Right?

130
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,328
It was hard before,
but now it's almost impossible!

131
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,264
Kushishishi!

132
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:04,433
You know, he has even
more tricks than Straw Hat.

133
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:07,937
For example, if I force
his shadow into a ball...

134
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,508
Oars will become a ball as well!

135
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:14,443
[NAMI]
No way.

136
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:18,781
What is happening?

137
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:24,787
Now that's nuts.

138
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,494
[MORIA]
Oars Ball!

139
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:34,530
Dodge this! Roll!

140
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,434
[SANJI]
Um. Okay.

141
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:44,307
[screaming]

142
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:47,476
C'mon, Master!

143
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,912
What's the big idea here, huh?

144
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,548
This is my fight!
I should get to drive!

145
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:54,150
[MORIA]
Kushi!

146
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:55,151
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:56,953
I didn't mean to interfere.

148
00:08:56,986 --> 00:08:59,922
I'll just focus on
assisting from here on.

149
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,926
And now, crush each one of
them however you see fit!

150
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,961
Hey!

151
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:07,096
This just occurred to me,
but where is Luffy?

152
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,298
He ran off after Moria
and got tricked somehow.

153
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:11,334
I'm sure he's
gonna be back soon, though.

154
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:12,368
Seriously?

155
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:15,605
Does he have to do
something stupid every time?

156
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,106
[NAMI thinking]
What should I do?

157
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,441
It probably won't
help if I tell them

158
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,042
another one
of the Seven Warlords

159
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:21,877
is somewhere on the island.

160
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:23,479
I'll get to that later.

161
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:25,514
Okay, I know I'm a
little late to the party,

162
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:26,716
but let me get this straight.

163
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:29,418
Are you saying we've gotta
defeat Luffy's zombie and Moria

164
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:31,954
if we want to get
everyone's shadows back?

165
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,589
Is that the gist of it?

166
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:35,391
Yeah. That's about it.

167
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:37,593
You're kidding!
The sun is almost up!

168
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:39,328
The enemy is
forcing our hand here!

169
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:41,030
It's not like we
have much of a choice!

170
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:43,065
[BROOK]
Excuse me.

171
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:44,300
[NAMI]
The skeleton.

172
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,968
I didn't know
you were here, too.

173
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,536
I beg of you.

174
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,238
Please allow me to help.

175
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:51,173
I have an idea
that just might work.

176
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,605
[CHOPPER] Get back here, Zoro!
Don't be reckless!

177
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,739
My friends.

178
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,841
I appreciate your trust in me.

179
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,177
I don't think it should
be too tough to pull it off.

180
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,745
Are you sure about this, Brook?

181
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,680
I'm not trying to
talk you out of it or anything,

182
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,549
but you saw what
happened to Franky, right?

183
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,951
Just don't blame me
if anything goes wrong, okay?

184
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,288
But if this is what
you want, I'm glad to help.

185
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,523
Now Dark Cloud Tempo!

186
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,696
[BROOK]
I'm ready. Fire at will.

187
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,866
I can't believe we're
using this thing again.

188
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,268
There is one thing
I fear more than death.

189
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,571
Being unable to repay my debts!

190
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,113
I'll fight to the last bone!

191
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,247
You can count on me!

192
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,850
Right! Try not to die!

193
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,018
[BROOK]
Here goes!

194
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,686
Slalom Vine!

195
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,158
Yohohoho!

196
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,764
[BROOK] I'm getting such a
shock that I can see my bones!

197
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,966
Well, I was only
bones to begin with.

198
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,167
Alright, here I come!

199
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,302
Like an arrow
forged with lightning!

200
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,840
Lightning Bone Sword!

201
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,610
Gavotte Bond En Avant!

202
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:18,344
It worked!

203
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,912
He shot straight through him!

204
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,214
There's a hole in me!

205
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,817
[USOPP] Now's our chance!
Follow up attack!

206
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,790
[BROOK] As they say,
mission accomplished.

207
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,159
Nice work there, Bones!

208
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,695
Alright. Two Sword Style:

209
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,163
Tower Climb!

210
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,737
You bastard. You're next.

211
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,275
But first, that skeleton's
gonna pay for hurting me.

212
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,810
Gum-Gum...

213
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,978
Oh no! He's goin' after Brook!

214
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,214
[OARS]
...Battle Axe!

215
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,782
Brook, no!

216
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,084
Skeleton!

217
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,061
[USOPP]
Take this!

218
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,263
Atlas Comet!

219
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,298
Hya!

220
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,972
Didn't work!

221
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:22,808
Oh, crap.

222
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,143
Keep fighting, Usopp!

223
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,378
Hey, what about you?

224
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,416
[OARS] You just made
yourself next, long nose.

225
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,352
Your friend with
the swords can wait.

226
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,858
Gum-Gum...

227
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,127
...Bazooka!

228
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,329
I'm a dead man!

229
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,005
[OARS]
Huh?

230
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:56,942
Hey! Why can't I stretch?

231
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:01,313
Ochenta Fleurs. Cuatro Manos.

232
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,988
Where'd all
these hands come from?

233
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,723
That's cheating!

234
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,225
Give it up,
or I'll snap your neck.

235
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,461
Your shadow revolution is over.

236
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,695
Huh?

237
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,131
Tighten Hold!

238
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,867
Okay, this hurts.

239
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,304
Hell yeah! Nice work, Robin!

240
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,908
Kushishi!

241
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,476
You honestly think
your little hand tricks

242
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,511
are enough to
put me in the ground?

243
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,779
Well if you wanna play dirty,

244
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,081
I don't mind
slingin' a little mud.

245
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,253
Have some Brick Bat.

246
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,495
Get away from her!

247
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,364
Veinte Fleurs!

248
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,999
Calendula!

249
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,005
Robin, no!

250
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,316
You wanna sink your
teeth into something?

251
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,451
Then try this!

252
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:27,366
Kushishishi!

253
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,505
Moria's shadow?

254
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,541
Kushishishi!

255
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,009
Well, considering you've got

256
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,011
such an effective
choke-hold on me,

257
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,882
I guess I'll have to pull out
my long-range weapons, as well.

258
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,251
[ROBIN thinking] I can't
let his shadow distract me.

259
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,552
I just have to take out the body

260
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,921
and the shadow
will disappear, too.

261
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,193
Cuatro Manos!

262
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,596
That's tight!

263
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,467
Okay, c'mon now. That's enough!

264
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,135
And then Clutch!

265
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:10,009
[MORIA screaming]

266
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:10,676
Nice!

267
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,945
Awesome! You did it, Robin!

268
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,084
Robin, look out!

269
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,253
Moria's shadow
is right behind you!

270
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:30,396
Kushishishi! Kushishishi!

271
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:38,687
Shishishishi!

272
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:59,541
Kushishishi!

273
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,481
Kushishishi!

274
00:16:05,514 --> 00:16:06,415
What?

275
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:08,317
How in the world
did Moria get over there?

276
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,320
Almost got me,
but not quite in time.

277
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:13,722
Y'see, I can switch
places with my Doppelman here

278
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:15,658
whenever I see fit.

279
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:21,296
Switch places? No way.

280
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,331
But that means...

281
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:24,199
...the one
inside Oars' stomach...

282
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:29,738
[MORIA] Yes, the one in
the cockpit is my shadow double.

283
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:32,041
And, your cute
little arm parlor tricks

284
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,176
don't have any effect on him.

285
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,555
Leave Robin alone!

286
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:56,598
Kushishishi!

287
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:21,523
Kushishishi!

288
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:24,426
I believe that puts three
of your team under my belt.

289
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:28,630
That bastard
stole Robin's shadow, too!

290
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:30,766
Kushishishi!

291
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,735
Too bad I don't
have a corpse on hand.

292
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:35,237
I'll just hold
onto you for safekeeping.

293
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,145
Diable Jambe.

294
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:45,547
You're gonna pay
for that, you monster!

295
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,286
Give Robin's
shadow back! Right now!

296
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,322
Extra Hachis!

297
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,690
Fly, Brick Bats!

298
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:59,161
Kushishishi!

299
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:01,697
He's switching places
with his shadow again?

300
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:08,137
If he switched out,
then that means...

301
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,274
Moria! He's back
inside Oars' stomach cockpit!

302
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:14,343
Kushi!

303
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:16,745
Well, look at that,
we're right back to square one.

304
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:18,280
[OARS]
Stupid Master!

305
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:20,315
I told ya once already!

306
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,818
This is my fight,
quit buttin' in!

307
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,853
[MORIA]
I do apologize, Oars.

308
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:27,723
I couldn't help myself
from getting in on the fun.

309
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:34,263
I'm takin' over now,

310
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,799
and I'm gonna start
by squishin that lady.

311
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:42,671
Now Gum-Gum...

312
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:44,807
He can stretch again!

313
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,508
There's no way
to escape him now!

314
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,476
Are you serious?

315
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:49,711
He's going after her
while she's unconscious?

316
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,153
Sanji, Robin!
Get out of the way!

317
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:00,556
...Bazooka!

318
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:02,925
[SANJI]
Diable Jambe...

319
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,327
...Frit Assorti!

320
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,529
What the...?

321
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:15,204
Whoa! He blocked it!

322
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,344
This is our chance.

323
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:24,446
Someone get Robin to safety!

324
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:25,881
[USOPP]
I've got her!

325
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:28,450
Hey!

326
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:31,286
Look, you guys! Check this out!

327
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,790
[SANJI]
Chopper?

328
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:36,859
What the hell're
ya doin' up there?

329
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:40,295
Some forensics work.

330
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:42,898
Searching for Oars'
original cause of death.

331
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:44,833
Cause of death?

332
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:46,401
[CHOPPER]
Aim for his right arm!

333
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,171
This one's new,
it's not his original arm!

334
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:51,840
Hogback did a
good job restoring it,

335
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:54,910
but the joints still
show signs of frostbite.

336
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,879
This is only an informed guess,

337
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:58,914
but I think he died
five hundred years ago

338
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,250
from exposure to the cold!

339
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,784
He might be a massive brute,

340
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:05,354
but he's still no
match for mother nature.

341
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:07,823
He got caught in the
cold and froze to death.

342
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:09,858
And if I had to
speculate any further,

343
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:12,394
he didn't just get
caught in the cold.

344
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:14,830
He was also naked!

345
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:17,599
I won't lose to
someone that dumb!

346
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,368
[CHOPPER]
Zombies may not feel pain,

347
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,270
but they can still take damage.

348
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,806
And all of our attacks have
weakened his original wounds.

349
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,542
This is our chance to
cut his attack power in half!

350
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,811
All we've gotta do
is get rid of this arm!

351
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:31,747
So focus all of
your attacks here!

352
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,815
[OARS]
Stop squeakin' in my ear!

353
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:36,885
And who the hell
said ya could stand on me?

354
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,223
Chopper, no!

355
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:53,368
What... Where'd he go?

356
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:54,436
[CHOPPER]
Nice punch there.

357
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:56,872
Too bad all you did
was hurt your own shoulder.

358
00:20:56,905 --> 00:20:59,441
You might not be able
to feel it, but trust me!

359
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:03,879
Huh? My hand's talking.

360
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:05,647
I'm kind of a small guy.

361
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,349
Your fist is
like a cavern to me,

362
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:09,384
full of cracks
that I can hide in.

363
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:10,986
Rumble...

364
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,421
Jumping Point!

365
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:13,922
And Arm Point!

366
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,759
[SANJI]
Chopper! Impressive work!

367
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:19,328
Here, let me give you a hand!

368
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,263
Sanji! Boost me up!

369
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:26,468
Armee De L'Air...

370
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:28,704
Cloven...

371
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:29,805
Go!

372
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:31,907
--Roseo Shoot!
--Roseo Shoot!

373
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:44,519
[OARS]
You're gettin' on my nerves!

374
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,991
Ya keep hittin' the same spot
but it's not even hurtin' me!

375
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:51,994
If it doesn't work once,
it's never gonna work!

376
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:53,061
Oh, it's gonna work!

377
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:55,998
Pain is a warning sign
used to protect the body.

378
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:59,568
Not feeling any pain
doesn't make you stronger!

379
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:00,702
[SANJI]
Chopper!

380
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:04,840
[OARS]
Just shut up already!

381
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:06,508
You gotta get
outta there, guys!

382
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,709
He's coming after you!

383
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,445
Now Gum-Gum...

384
00:22:11,813 --> 00:22:13,515
This looks bad.

385
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:15,317
Really bad.

386
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,687
...Gatling!

387
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:28,764
Sanji! Chopper!

388
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,882
[NAMI]
He took down another two.

389
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:50,419
One by one. He's destroying us.

390
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,753
Damn it!

391
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:56,391
[MORIA]
Kushishishi!

392
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,795
Kushishishi!

393
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:03,098
Number four, and number five.

394
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:11,473
Kushishishi!

395
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:13,542
[MORIA]
Only three left to go!

396
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:21,650
[USOPP] I have no idea who you
are, but thanks for rescuing me!

397
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:23,552
Speaking of,
who are you, anyway?

398
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:24,820
[LUFFY]
Monkey D. Luffy.

399
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:25,821
[USOPP]
You're lying.

400
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:27,756
[LUFFY]
No. It's really me.

401
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:30,058
[USOPP]
What? What happened to you?

402
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:34,062
Whoa! And how in the heck did
you get so stinkin' strong?

403
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:35,730
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

404
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:37,599
"The Incredible Battle Starts!

405
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:39,134
Luffy vs. Luffy!"

406
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,770
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
