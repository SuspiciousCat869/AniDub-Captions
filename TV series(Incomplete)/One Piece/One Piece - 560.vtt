00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:05.205
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:08.241
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:11.011
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.246
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.547
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.648
You can have it!

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.485
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.754
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.722
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:26.926
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:37.025
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:39.962
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:45.234
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:47.336
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:48.704
to ever chart these waters

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:51.006
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:52.841
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:55.277
this has proven to be
the end of the road,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.980
a graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:02.618
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:04.253
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.286 --> 00:03:07.923
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:07.956 --> 00:03:12.127
[LUFFY] I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.932
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:19.701
Luffy and his crew
arrive on Fishman Island,

00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:23.772
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:23.806 --> 00:03:26.108
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:30.979
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:31.013 --> 00:03:32.848
It's not long before
the Straw Hats

00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:34.416
get pulled into the conflict

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.486
and find themselves in
the midst of an all-out war!

00:03:38.253 --> 00:03:39.988
[FISHMAN D]
It's leaving! Look!

00:03:40.022 --> 00:03:42.791
The Noah's not headed
toward the island anymore!

00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:44.660
[FISHMAN C] The princess
is leading it away from us!

00:03:44.693 --> 00:03:46.995
It won't crash
into us after all!

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:48.997
Don't let it hit you!

00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:50.666
[FISHMAN F]
Swim faster!

00:03:52.568 --> 00:03:54.136
If I'm going to
steer the Noah clear of

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.306
the bubble, then I have to swim
as far out to sea as I can!

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:59.007
[DECKEN] But one teeny-tiny
little magic word

00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:02.678
can spare you this dread fate,
and that's, "Yes!"

00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:04.112
Simply utter that one word

00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:06.548
and your troubles will be over!

00:04:06.582 --> 00:04:08.083
I'm deeply sorry, Sir Decken,

00:04:08.116 --> 00:04:09.751
but I simply can't do that!

00:04:09.785 --> 00:04:11.820
Why must you refuse to marry me?

00:04:11.854 --> 00:04:13.322
Because you're not my type!

00:04:13.355 --> 00:04:14.490
[screams]

00:04:14.523 --> 00:04:16.325
Then to Hell with you!

00:04:16.358 --> 00:04:18.026
[SHIRAHOSHI screams]

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.127
[DECKEN gasps]

00:04:19.161 --> 00:04:20.863
You need to learn
how to treat a lady!

00:04:20.896 --> 00:04:22.931
Or anybody, for that matter!

00:04:22.965 --> 00:04:24.933
Shirahoshi is our baby sister!

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:27.202
We will never let you
lay a hand on her.

00:04:27.236 --> 00:04:28.237
Not ever!

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.705
You came to save me!

00:04:29.738 --> 00:04:32.140
And Hoe's here
as well! Thank you!

00:04:32.174 --> 00:04:33.175
[HOE chirps]

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:36.812
[FUKABOSHI] I also regret being
suspicious of you at first--

00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:38.480
[LUFFY]
Eh, it's no big deal.

00:04:38.514 --> 00:04:39.848
Let's head to the deck!

00:04:39.882 --> 00:04:42.718
[laughs]

00:04:46.088 --> 00:04:48.390
Goodness!
If it isn't Hordy Jones!

00:04:48.423 --> 00:04:50.092
[laughs]

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:52.361
Say, whatever
happened to Neptune?

00:04:52.394 --> 00:04:54.096
Dead maybe?

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:55.898
By the way, I'm using the Noah

00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:57.799
to torture Shirahoshi
as we speak!

00:04:57.833 --> 00:05:00.602
A genius idea on my part!

00:05:00.636 --> 00:05:02.337
Don't you think, Brother?

00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:05.207
[laughs]

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.208
It's not bad,

00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:08.810
but I think I've got
an even better idea.

00:05:08.844 --> 00:05:13.649
[laughs]
Do you now? Well, let's hear it!

00:05:14.883 --> 00:05:15.851
[DECKEN]
Huh...?

00:05:15.884 --> 00:05:18.453
Actually,
it's better if I show you.

00:05:18.487 --> 00:05:22.090
--[slashing]
--[DECKEN groans]

00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:30.065
[DECKEN rasping]

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.836
If you died,
what would become of this ship?

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.371
Well, Decken?

00:05:39.207 --> 00:05:41.043
[LUFFY]
"The Fierce Fight Begins!

00:05:41.076 --> 00:05:42.844
Luffy vs. Hordy!"

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:05.934
[laughs]

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.320
[DECKEN groans]

00:06:36.031 --> 00:06:40.936
Hordy. You've made
a terrible mistake.

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:46.208
I've just touched
you with my left hand!

00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:48.677
You turned your back on me!

00:06:51.146 --> 00:06:55.150
As I recall, Decken,
you started this yourself.

00:06:55.183 --> 00:06:56.318
You know...

00:06:56.351 --> 00:06:59.021
To be honest, I was a bit
nervous when I first saw

00:06:59.054 --> 00:07:02.324
the shadow of the Noah
looming over Fishman Island.

00:07:02.357 --> 00:07:03.792
But after I thought about it,

00:07:03.825 --> 00:07:06.795
breaking the bubble didn't
seem like such a bad idea.

00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:09.131
Fishman Island
would be wiped out,

00:07:09.164 --> 00:07:11.633
but we'd still have
the Fishman District.

00:07:11.667 --> 00:07:14.569
And if you die, here and now,

00:07:14.603 --> 00:07:17.939
then your Mark-Mark power
will deactivate. Right?

00:07:17.973 --> 00:07:20.642
Then the ship will come
crashing down right onto

00:07:20.676 --> 00:07:22.878
that useless kingdom.

00:07:25.814 --> 00:07:28.650
[HORDY]
Then, nothing will remain.

00:07:28.684 --> 00:07:31.553
What I want most,
right now, is to take care of

00:07:31.586 --> 00:07:35.223
all of those meddlesome
Straw Hat Pirates. For good!

00:07:35.257 --> 00:07:36.224
True.

00:07:36.258 --> 00:07:38.794
I stand to lose--
well, thousands--

00:07:38.827 --> 00:07:41.430
but, it'll be easy enough
for me to pick up all

00:07:41.463 --> 00:07:43.865
the human slaves
I want later on.

00:07:48.603 --> 00:07:51.973
Thousands will die, huh?

00:07:52.007 --> 00:07:53.475
I like that.

00:07:53.508 --> 00:07:55.777
Why don't we start...

00:07:55.811 --> 00:07:57.245
...with you!

00:07:59.915 --> 00:08:01.550
[screams]

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.587
What are you doing?

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.089
Stop it!

00:08:07.122 --> 00:08:09.057
[screams]

00:08:12.294 --> 00:08:15.063

[HORDY chuckles]

00:08:29.644 --> 00:08:31.680
Die for New Fishman Island.

00:08:31.713 --> 00:08:33.515
We'll be sure to remember you.

00:08:35.217 --> 00:08:37.686
[DECKEN rasps]

00:09:07.415 --> 00:09:09.351

00:09:09.985 --> 00:09:12.387
[laughs]

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.523
You'll be dead before long.

00:09:14.556 --> 00:09:17.025
And then the great ship
Noah will begin its descent,

00:09:17.058 --> 00:09:20.729
bringing my wrath upon
this wretched land!

00:09:20.762 --> 00:09:23.098
You know, I'm a kind man.

00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:26.168
So just for you--

00:09:26.201 --> 00:09:29.638
Maybe I should make
your beloved join you in death?

00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:31.973
Your time has come, princess!

00:09:34.376 --> 00:09:35.577
He stabbed him!

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.346
First they're pals, now they're
shakin' each other off?

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.248
No time to worry about that now!

00:09:40.282 --> 00:09:41.883
Look out! Here he comes!

00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:44.553
[MANBOSHI, RYUBOSHI]
We'll stop you, Hordy!

00:09:44.586 --> 00:09:46.388
Oh, yeah? Not likely.

00:09:47.255 --> 00:09:48.924
[MANBOSHI, RYUBOSHI yell]

00:09:48.957 --> 00:09:50.959

You're not the ones I'm after.

[HOE chirps]

00:09:55.931 --> 00:09:58.133
Dear brothers, no!

[MANBOSHI groans]

00:09:59.835 --> 00:10:03.338
Run! You have to
get out of here right now!

00:10:03.371 --> 00:10:05.340
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]
All right.

00:10:08.076 --> 00:10:10.245
This'll be easy now
that you've left the safety

00:10:10.278 --> 00:10:13.181
of the Hard Shell
Tower, Princess.

[HORDY laughs]
What a pity.

00:10:44.446 --> 00:10:46.948
Your kind are the world's
fastest swimmers.

00:10:46.982 --> 00:10:49.384
But with this power, I'm faster.

00:11:42.304 --> 00:11:45.807
That's right. This time
we won't lose so easily.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.443
Geh. Of course.

[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, at Fishman
Island's Conchcorde Plaza.

00:11:57.619 --> 00:12:00.221
Captain Vander Decken
doesn't like me anymore,

00:12:00.255 --> 00:12:02.924
so he left me here to die!

[DECKEN]
Them's the breaks!

00:12:04.225 --> 00:12:06.661
You're just one more thing
I have to sacrifice

00:12:06.695 --> 00:12:08.830
in my pursuit of Shirahoshi!

cryin' and fight, you big baby!

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.905
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE CC] Yeah,
you're the only one big enough

00:12:16.938 --> 00:12:18.340
to beat up the Kraken!

I know you can win, Surume!

Come on, kick his butt!

00:12:22.077 --> 00:12:24.412
But he's almost
the same size as the Kraken.

00:12:24.446 --> 00:12:27.115
So I wonder why he's
so scared to fight him.

00:12:27.148 --> 00:12:28.917
Well, I wouldn't want to.

hear correctly.

[WADATSUMI]
Huh...?

He didn't say "sacrifice."

[WADATSUMI]
Huh?

00:12:44.099 --> 00:12:45.934
[ZEO] You didn't really think
he would destroy the island

and leave you to
your death, did you?

00:12:48.837 --> 00:12:52.374
But... he did say
I was gonna die!

00:12:52.407 --> 00:12:54.476
[ZEO] He was just saying
you should fight as though

00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:56.611
you were prepared to die.

00:12:56.644 --> 00:12:58.313

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.722
with something so
important. That's great!

00:13:07.756 --> 00:13:09.157
What a big boy!

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.726
Uh, what he means is...
you're strong!

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.230
Oh. Now I get it!

00:13:16.898 --> 00:13:19.300
[ZEO]
I don't think you do.

00:13:19.334 --> 00:13:21.970
Anyway, this is for you!

00:13:22.003 --> 00:13:23.772
I want you to take it so
you can help us defeat

00:13:23.805 --> 00:13:26.141
those mean old Straw Hats, okay?

00:13:33.648 --> 00:13:35.350
That's an Energy Steroid!

00:13:35.383 --> 00:13:36.418
Wait a sec.

00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:38.620
How's it gonna work
on somebody that big?

00:13:38.653 --> 00:13:41.256

Surume!

00:14:03.878 --> 00:14:05.346
I'm sorry, Captain!

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.016
I should've trusted
you all along!

00:14:08.049 --> 00:14:09.017
Nice work!

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.985
That stupid squid
is history now!

Hey, are you okay there, buddy?

[CHOPPER]
Oh no, he's unconscious!

the same person anymore!

be so proud of me!

Who's next?

00:14:56.965 --> 00:14:59.968
Uh, I think he said
to kill that guy!

00:15:00.001 --> 00:15:01.769
[WADATSUMI]
The blue dude?

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.022
Okay!

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.905
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
It's just one tiny kick!

00:15:30.939 --> 00:15:32.474

That's it, pal!

Here's the deal!

If you put so much as a single
scratch on our beautiful

another gap in your teeth!

00:16:16.117 --> 00:16:17.085
What?

00:16:17.118 --> 00:16:19.120
Why are all his kicks
working so well?

00:16:19.154 --> 00:16:20.455
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE L]
I don't know if this guy

00:16:20.488 --> 00:16:23.758
is crazy strong, or the
giant guy is crazy weak!

00:16:23.792 --> 00:16:25.193
[NAMI]
Oh, great.

00:16:25.226 --> 00:16:26.227
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE K]
Hmm?

00:16:30.298 --> 00:16:32.434
Now I'm all dirty.

fault--that guy knocked me over.

You want to fight?
Then fight me.

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:48.983
I want a piece of you, too.

00:17:17.779 --> 00:17:19.414
Make it snappy, okay?

00:17:19.447 --> 00:17:21.583
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE N] Does this
place look like a bar to you?

00:17:21.616 --> 00:17:24.185
Besides, isn't that
like cannibalism?

[HYOUZOU groans]

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:29.891

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE DD] It's too
late, he's already passed out.

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:40.335

What a pathetic display.

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE O, P]
Huh?

00:17:41.469 --> 00:17:43.071
[NURU]
This is my chance.

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:45.840
If I prove myself, then
I might become an officer

00:17:45.874 --> 00:17:47.275
in just one move!

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.751

Hmph.

[NURU]
Nururu. I see.

00:18:01.756 --> 00:18:05.059
You're far too crafty to
fall for a surprise attack!

00:18:05.093 --> 00:18:06.561
Who the hell are you?

00:18:08.363 --> 00:18:11.866
[NURU] I'm the soon-to-be number
one Fishman swordsman.

[HYOUZOU groans]

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:25.747
A hangover?

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.248
What should we do?

00:18:28.082 --> 00:18:29.951
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE EE]
He's freaking out!

00:18:54.475 --> 00:18:57.512
Damn. You're far more
skilled than I thought.

00:18:57.545 --> 00:18:59.614
[ZORO]
And you're no good at all.

00:18:59.647 --> 00:19:00.748
[NURU gasps]

00:19:02.817 --> 00:19:05.353

[NURU] Heh. Good luck dodging
my attacks now that

00:19:12.427 --> 00:19:14.295
you can't use your eyes!

No.

You only see with your eyes?

Some swordsman you are.

You just got lucky that time!

00:19:57.205 --> 00:19:59.107
I'm destined to be
the number one swordsman,

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.409
and I'll cut down anyone
who stands in my way!

Not again!

we're on your side--

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE GG]
I dunno but I'm scared!

usual--get ready!

[HYOUZOU]
Huh...?

00:20:41.716 --> 00:20:43.818
He cut through that like paper!

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES screaming]

00:20:46.688 --> 00:20:47.722
I don't get it.

00:20:47.755 --> 00:20:50.825
He was writhing in pain,
and then he changed color!

00:20:50.858 --> 00:20:52.627
Yeah. I don't get it either.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.930
But that's exactly what happened
to Hordy when he transformed.

00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:57.265
At least Hordy had the decency

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:59.434
not to swing swords at us!

too many swords.

Finally, a worthy opponent.

00:21:46.614 --> 00:21:49.550
That last guy was too easy.

Hold on.

00:21:50.585 --> 00:21:53.755
You heard me.
I'm calling dibs on him.

00:21:53.788 --> 00:21:55.056
We might as well get a warm up

00:21:55.089 --> 00:21:57.091
before we go to the New World.

00:21:57.125 --> 00:21:58.693
Should be fun.

00:21:58.726 --> 00:22:00.728
[HYOUZOU chuckles]

00:22:07.635 --> 00:22:10.438
That sucks. Guess it's
not as strong underwater.

00:22:10.471 --> 00:22:13.074
Tch. "Not as strong?"
Tough luck.

00:22:13.107 --> 00:22:15.376
Look. Give it up already.

00:22:15.409 --> 00:22:18.179
We're thousands of meters
underwater, you fool!

00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:19.514
You can fight.

00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:21.649
But there's no way in hell
you're going to win--

00:22:21.682 --> 00:22:23.985
not against a fishman!

00:22:24.018 --> 00:22:25.186
See?

00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:29.056
Either way, the whole
island is doomed!

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.392
That includes
your friends, the princess,

00:22:31.425 --> 00:22:33.661
and everyone else down there!

00:22:33.694 --> 00:22:35.129
You're just a weakling!

00:22:35.163 --> 00:22:37.698
Get it? You can't
protect anyone!

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.334
Watch me.

Hmm?

years. I'm ready!

[NARRATOR] The Straw Hat
Pirates go head to head

00:23:13.334 --> 00:23:15.903
with the powerful officers
from Hordy's Crew.

00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:17.572
Thanks to their
two years of training,

00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:19.106
they hold their
own with a flurry

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.608
of new fighting techniques.

00:23:20.641 --> 00:23:23.144
However, their struggle
will all be for naught,

00:23:23.177 --> 00:23:25.780
if Luffy cannot find a way
to overcome Hordy

00:23:25.813 --> 00:23:29.217
and stop the Noah from crushing
Fishman Island.
