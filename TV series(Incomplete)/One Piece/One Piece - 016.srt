[KURO chuckles]
That's right.

172
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:55,786
Three years ago I planned
to erase Captain Kuro,

173
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:59,832
and every last person
who ever knew him.

174
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:05,004
It's all part of
my plan! [chuckles]

175
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,464
[LUFFY]
You guys are dumb.

176
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,050
You're the most uncool
pirates I know.

177
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:11,844
Huh. We're "uncool", huh?

178
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,180
Pirates are nothing
more than savages,

179
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,350
incapable of rising above
their animal nature.

180
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:20,728
Without my plans, what could
they possibly accomplish?

181
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:25,358
A crew is nothing to me. They
are simply a means to an end.

182
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,153
Crewmembers are just
pawns in the Captain's game.

183
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:32,406
Whether my men live or die
is up to me and me alone.

184
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,909
If I tell them to fight,
they will fight,

185
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:38,037
and if I order them to die,
they had better do it.

186
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,040
They know the punishment
for disobedience.

187
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,378
Huh?!

188
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:55,763
[growls]

189
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:57,932
[KURO]
This is how pirates are!

190
00:10:58,015 --> 00:11:01,227
Don't you dare talk
down to me, boy!

191
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:05,106
[PIRATES murumur]

192
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:07,066
[KURO growls]

193
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:09,235
[LUFFY] You know, no
matter how many hundreds,

194
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:13,364
or thousands of men follow
you as their Captain.

195
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,534
You will never be
as good as Usopp!

196
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,577
[PIRATES gasp]

197
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:22,790
You fool. Are you
saying that I am inferior

198
00:11:22,873 --> 00:11:25,084
to a kid pretending
to be a pirate?

199
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,127
That's right!

200
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:31,424
[laughs] Well aren't you
funny?! Don't get all cocky

201
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,885
just because you snapped
off one of my cat claws!

202
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:39,390
How exactly is he better
than me?! Let's hear it!

203
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:45,938
'Cause he's got heart.

204
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,940
[KURO]
He's got what?

205
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,445
[LUFFY] A guy like you doesn't
know what a true pirate is!

206
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,159
[PIRATES stammer]

207
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:05,291
[PIRATE A]
Impossible!

208
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,335
[PIRATE I] He kept up with
the pussyfoot maneuver!

209
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,340
[KURO]
How insulting.

210
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,512
[KURO] It would appear
that you need a lesson

211
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:21,307
in what real pirates are like.

212
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,977
It's not pleasant.

213
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,688
Your first lesson
will be about terror.

214
00:12:27,688 --> 00:12:32,151
A lesson I learned well
as I stared down death!

215
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,200
Hey! Should he be
in that stance?!

216
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,327
No, this is bad!

217
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,496
[PIRATE X] Why's he
using that technique?!

218
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,331
[PIRATE DD]
He's only fighting one guy.

219
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:49,710
There's no reason to use the
Out of the Back Attack!

220
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,004
[PIRATE X]
This isn't a good spot for us!

221
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,214
I mean, he could get us too!

222
00:12:53,297 --> 00:12:57,176
[PIRATE M] Yeah. He did say he
was gonna kill us all earlier.

223
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,221
[PIRATE DD] Please Captain Kuro!
Anything but that technique!

224
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:02,181
[PIRATE G]
We'll do anything, Captain!

225
00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:04,642
[PIRATE X]
Please, Captain Kuro!

226
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:09,688
What's the big deal? He's just
wobbling back and forth.

227
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,237
[PIRATES begging]

228
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:27,831

00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:51,981
We're begging you,
Captain! Let us live!

[PIRATES chattering]

231
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:08,038
[KURO]
Out of the Back Attack!

232
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:22,553
[NAMI grunts]
What a small haul!

233
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:26,640
You know I really thought they'd
have more treasure than this!

234
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:29,476
Let's see if the boys have
finished this fight yet.

235
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:35,649
Huh? What...? Everyone
has stopped... Is it over?

236
00:14:40,237 --> 00:14:41,822
[PIRATE EE screams]

[LUFFY gasps]

238
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:48,829
What's he doing over there?!

00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:52,666
[PIRATES screaming]

240
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,753

That guy's everywhere!

[PIRATES groaning]

242
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:03,761
Don't do this Captain!
Please stop!

243
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:04,762
We're dead!

244
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:06,847
We can't reason with him
now that he's started!

245
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:08,766
His sidestep maneuver is so fast

246
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:11,518
not even he knows
what he's cutting!

247
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,104
But how could he have killed
so many of us without even‐‐

‐‐[groans]
‐‐No!

00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:23,572
[NAMI]
What's happening out there?!

250
00:15:23,614 --> 00:15:26,450
People are just getting
cut to ribbons!

[PIRATES screaming, groaning]

252
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:43,759

Don't you have any honor?!
Those men are your friends!

00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:05,656

00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:33,308
[LUFFY panting]
I found you.

260
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,810
You bastard.

261
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:37,813
You should've accepted
your fate like a good boy...

262
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:39,773
Now look what you've done!

263
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:44,695
Thanks to you, my little pawns
are still alive, and in misery.

264
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:48,824
It would have been better to
just let them die in the attack.

265
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:58,792
[KURO] So, now what?
Do you have something to say?

266
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,502
[LUFFY]
Yeah.

267
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:04,381
No matter what happens to me...

268
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:06,508
I will never be like you...

269
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,844
[KURO]
Not "will".

270
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:12,806
Someone like you...

271
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:14,725
can't be like me.

272
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:26,528
[KURO]
You see...

273
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,323
You are going to die here today.

274
00:17:29,364 --> 00:17:31,492
But first, you'll
writhe in agony

275
00:17:31,492 --> 00:17:35,871
as I hack you up like a fish.

276
00:17:35,913 --> 00:17:38,665
I'm going to carve you up...

277
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:40,834
and I'm going to enjoy it.

you to her! Just don't kill us!

I knew it!

lying to me from the beginning!

No! We failed!

sure got in over your heads,

didn't you?

Rich girl, I know you're here!
Listen! Unless you show yourself

320
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:50,464
I'll execute these
three little lambs...

321
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:54,134
And I will make sure to do it
in a most painful fashion!

Do not doubt my skill
at such a task!

They're the other way!

There's no need for that.

00:20:21,662 --> 00:20:26,500
Please, leave the children
be. I'll write the will.

332
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,584
No, Kaya!

as you write that will!

I'm sorry...

Silly girl. Don't you know
you can't bargain with me?

336
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:42,849
Captain Kuro specifically
instructed me

337
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:44,559
to get rid of everyone.

Wha...?!

If you don't do exactly as I say
then you won't get to kill me,

342
00:20:56,947 --> 00:20:59,074
and, I won't write my will!
