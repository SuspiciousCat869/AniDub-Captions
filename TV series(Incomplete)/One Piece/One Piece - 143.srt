82
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,620

is reflecting that.

If the needle is
pointing toward the sky,

pointing toward sky island.

00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,167
The fact that, you know,
we can't fly and all that?

106
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,006
all I know about sky island
is word of mouth; rumor.

00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,507

00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,595
Our Log Pose is broken.

112
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,638
That's all it is.

113
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,557
Not quite, Miss Navigator.

114
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,018
You're trying to fix something
that's not even broken.

115
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,855
We should be trying to find
a way to get to sky island.

Out here, on the water,
this is one of

the most steadfast
and unbreakable rules.

122

What we should be doubting
is the common sense

123
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,704
we all have that tells us

124
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,708
an island cannot exist in
the sky on an ocean of nothing.

125
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,752
That needle is pointing
toward an island.

126
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,628
I'd bet my life on it.

127
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,472

[USOPP]
Okay, jump!

138
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:07,909
What kind of trouble

139
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,869
are those two getting
themselves into now?

140
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,913
Probably the bad kind.

141
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,582
[SANJI]
Hey! Looks good as new.

142
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,084
Except for the
holes on the crown.

143
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,835
Those came from
an external source.

144
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,087
Oh yeah.

145
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,589
Looks like it could have been
arrows or a spear, or something.

146
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,007
[ROBIN]
Not quite but good guess.

147
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,552
These are from a medical
procedure called craterization.

148
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,303
Right, doctor?

149
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,888
[CHOPPER]
Mm. An ancient one.

150
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,264
They cut out a
small hole in the skull

151
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,225
to remove a foreign
mass, like a tumor.

152
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,643
And since it leaves
a crater behind,

153
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,228
that's how you get the name.

154
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,271
Knowing how old of
a technique this is,

155
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,733
I'd say this man has been
dead at least 200 years.

156
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,153
[ROBIN] I can also say
with confidence this man was

157
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,824
in his early thirties
when he died.

158
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,534
It must have been
during his voyage

159
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,162
that he finally succumbed to
the illness, whatever it was.

160
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,874
Much more than
the rest of his bones,

161
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,545
his teeth have remained
in surprisingly good condition.

162
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,756
Because he rubbed tar on them.

163
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,675
It was a common
practice in the South Blue

164
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,677
to keep out
bacterial infections.

165
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,971
And considering
the history of that region,

166
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,974
I'd suspect that he was
with an exploratory party.

167
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,768
Here it is.

168
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,812
The Briss Kingdom
of the South Blue.

169
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:22,817
They launched the St. Briss
as a scout ship, 208 years ago.

170
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,484
[NAMI]
That's it!

171
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,569
That's the ship that fell on us.

172
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,321
[ZORO] Yeah, I recognize
that figurehead out front.

173
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,657
[ROBIN] It's probably sailed
the seas above us unmanned

174
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,200
since the captain and crew died.

175
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:35,246
It's amazing what you can tell
from looking at old bones!

176
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,664
I'm sure you've heard

177
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,666
that dead men
tell no tales, right?

178
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,168
But everything aroud them does.

179
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,252
If this was a scouting party,

180
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,754
we should find evidence
of that on the St. Briss.

181
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,674
Yeah. Except it's
sinking like a stone.

182
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,009
What are you doing, you idiot?

183
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:48,926
You can't swim!

184
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,304
[LUFFY]
Help! Help me!

185
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,974
[LUFFY]
Heh. You won't believe it!

186
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:55,975
I did it!

187
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,810
[pants]

188
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,271
I found the most
incredible thing!

189
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,818
[CREW]
A map of the sky island?

190
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,028
It's called Skypiea?

191
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,070
That's right.

192
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:08,905
Then it's true.

193
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,948
There really is
an island up there.

194
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,118
[cheering]

195
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,037
The island's real!
The island's real!

196
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,121
The island's real!

197
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:17,872
It's a dream!

198
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,749
It's a dream!
It's a dream!

199
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,793
Time to journey up
to sky island!

200
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,003
Hold on, guys.

201
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,130
We don't know how to get there
or if it's even possible.

202
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,089
Not to mention there are

203
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,675
a lot of fake treasure
maps in circulation.

204
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,970
[NAMI]
No, I mean. Sure, it's real.

205
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,724
It's gotta be because...
Well, just 'cause.

206
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,769
But the fact is that map doesn't
tell us how to find the place!

207
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,938
You're the navigator!
Navigate something!

208
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:42,897
I can't just make things up!

209
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,190
[SANJI]
That Nami is a vision

210
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,235
even when she's chewing
someone's head off.

211
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,819
[punch]

212
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,071
[NAMI]
This isn't about me.

213
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,072
It's about reality.

214
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,908
And the reality is that
we know next to nothing.

215
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,119
What we do know is that we can't
defy gravity and sail upwards.

216
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,371
That's impossible.

217
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,248
What we need is
more information.

218
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,250
If a big ship like
that made it up there,

219
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,418
then the odds are we
can do the same thing.

220
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,672
We just have to find all
the records left on that ship.

221
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,800
I think the ship's at the
bottom of the ocean by now.

222
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,427
If it sunk, we'll salvage it!

223
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,096
Salvage!

224
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,098
We can't do that!

225
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,266
Salvage? Really?

226
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,935
Yeah, but we couldn't pull
a ship up from the bottom.

227
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,188
I think they'll have to come up
with a more refined plan.

228
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,905
Ha ha ha! This is adventure!

229
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,448
I know I've done
more dangerous things,

230
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,158
but I can't remember what.

231
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,869
[SANJI] Nami, I swear to find
you the answers you seek,

232
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,955
or I will refuse to return!

233
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:41,998
I'll hold you to that.

234
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,873
You'll be safe.

235
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,292
Those barrels
are my special design.

236
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,794
They've never been busted.

237
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,883
Good luck! Be careful!

238
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,969
We'll be pulling for ya.

239
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,018
[LUFFY]
Hey, look at that!

240
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,269
This is Chopper here.

241
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,937
Can you guys call off?

242
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:05,855
[LUFFY]
This is Luffy,

243
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,065
and there's a ton of
monsters down here.

244
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,318
[ZORO] We're on a nest
of giant sea snakes.

245
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,987
[SANJI] This is Sanji,
and they're staring at me.

246
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:13,821
Keep going.

247
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,364
They could die!

248
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,407
[NAMI]
They'll be fine, Usopp.

249
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,992
Don't worry.

250
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:18,909
And Chopper.

251
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,494
Hold that brake tightly.

252
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,287
Right.

253
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,374
I'm so glad they
didn't make me go.

254
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,379
[PIRATES]
Salvage!

255
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,299
Salvage the sea!

256
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,135
Salvage!

257
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,721
Salvage the sea!

258
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,515
What's all that noise?

259
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:46,646
[PIRATES]
Salvage the sea! Salvage!

260
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:53,235
Salvage the sea! Salvage!

261
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,405
[MASIRA]
Company, halt!

262
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,117
[PIRATES]
Aye aye, sir!

263
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,371
[MASIRA] Are we on top of
the place where the ship sank?

264
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,082
[PIRATES]
Aye aye, Captain, sir!

265
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,085
[MASIRA]
When they say captain and sir,

266
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,087
they're talking about me!

267
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,255
Prepare to raise the ship!

268
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,132
What lies on the
bottom now belongs

269
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,842
to the King of All Salvagers!

270
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:20,262
Captain of the
Masira Pirates, Masira!

271
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,349
[cheering]

272
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,852
[NAMI] Great. A boat of unstable
men led by an unstable monkey.

273
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,479
Hey! What are
you guys doing here?

274
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,774
In case you didn't know,
all these waters belong to me.

275
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,192
They do?

276
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,318
Yeah, that's right!

277
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,277
Every vessel that sinks

278
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,822
in these parts
automatically becomes mine.

279
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,864
You're not trying
to take something

280
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,283
that belongs to me, are you?

281
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,244
[ROBIN] So he's going
to bring it to the surface.

282
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,620
Easier for us.

283
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,747
[USOPP] But not for the
three guys already in the water.

284
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,208
We should just keep our mouths
shut and let him do it.

285
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,460
Stop mumbling and answer me!

286
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,712
Are you people trying to yank

287
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,131
one of my salvages
out from under me?

288
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,132
[NAMI]
Excuse me!

289
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,842
Can I ask you a question first?

290
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,635
You've got questions for me?

291
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,179
Fine. Sure. Whatever.
Ask me anything.

292
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,639
[NAMI] Are all of you
tough, good‐looking men

293
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,307
gonna salvage that ship?

294
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,350
[MASIRA]
What?

295
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,477
[whistles]

296
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,812
Thank you.

297
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,897
I see you know what
a real man looks like.

298
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,482
[NAMI]
What are you talking about?

299
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,151
You called us all
tough and good‐looking.

300
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,360
That includes me.

301
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,486
[NAMI]
Well, of course!

302
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,530
Stop! You're making me blush!

303
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,157
[giggles]

304
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,658
[USOPP]
This is disturbing.

305
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,494
So, are you gonna
salvage that thing or what?

306
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,495
[MASIRA]
Of course!

307
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,831
I'm not the King of All
Salvagers for nothing!

308
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,584
If there's a sunken ship
before me, then I'll salvage it!

309
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,754
If it's not sunken, then I'll
sink it and salvage it later.

310
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,506
Now, I know how impressed you
are, but we have to save it.

311
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,300
There's salvaging at hand!

312
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,301
Loser.

313
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,678
Do you mind if we watch
you big strong men work?

314
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,929
[MASIRA]
Huh?

315
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,682
Don't tell me you've never seen
a professional salvage before.

316
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,683
Haha!

317
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,853
You just watch us till
your heart's content!

318
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,854
That's that.

319
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,898
Now we just have to wait
and see what happens.

320
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,815
Below.

321
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,568
In the water, there's a‐‐

322
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,445
Captain, we have a problem!

323
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,154
What is it?

324
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,071
Something happened to the guys

325
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,574
who went into the water
to set the cradle.

326
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,659
Was it one of those
Sea Kings again?

327
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,911
[PIRATE B]
I don't think so.

328
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,954
It looks like someone went to
town on them with their fists.

329
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,122
What?

330
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,666
You mean someone else besides
our guys are down there?

331
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,709
I'm gonna kill 'em.

332
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,420
You may not get the chance.

333
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,880
Listen up, you!

334
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,218
There's someone else
down there, so be careful!

335
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,761
Oh, sure.

336
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,638
[NAMI, USOPP]
What a moron.

337
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,972
I want all hands
setting the cradle!

338
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,391
The ship comes up in 20 minutes!

339
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,519
We've got salvaging to do!

340
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,480
Aye aye, Captain!

341
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,260
[NAMI]
Okay, he's waving at us.

342
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,761
Smile and wave back, I guess.

343
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,513
Just act normal.

344
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,473
[USOPP]
Doing my best.

345
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,724
Don't get stage‐fright, fellas.

346
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,642
They're observers.

347
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,768
They want to see something new.

348
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,812
So show them how it's done.

349
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,647
If you're still nervous,

350
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,774
try picturing them
in their underwear.

351
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,943
Aye aye, Captain!

352
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,653
[MASIRA]
Drop the cradle!

353
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,280
[PIRATES]
Aye aye!

354
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,743
[MASIRA] Keep your eyes
peeled for those intruders!

355
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,787
[DIVER A]
Aye aye, sir!

356
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,621
These guys really take

357
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,790
their salvaging
seriously don't they?

358
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,292
I think they're showing off

359
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,960
because their captain
has a crush on me.

360
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:38,544
[MASIRA]
Move it, men!

361
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,504
I want this done fast!

362
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,381
[PIRATES]
Aye aye, sir!

363
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,348
Ohhh...

364
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,933
[gasps]

365
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,367
[LUFFY]
Hmm...

366
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,310
[SANJI]
Hmm...

367
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,092
[SANJI]
Hmm...

368
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,430
[LUFFY]
Zoro.

369
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,723
Look.

370
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,674
[DIVER A]
Cradle set is locked in place.

371
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,762
[LUFFY]
What was that?

372
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,305
Huh?

373
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,527
Uh, so why such a big monkey?

374
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,113
There on the bow of the ship.

375
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:11,780
[MASIRA]
Oh, that.

376
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,158
Hehehe. You like?

377
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,076
It's a special prow I designed.

378
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,119
It aids in our salvage.

379
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,287
Just watch.

380
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,580
[sighing]

381
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,665
You're gonna love this!

382
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,168
Lower the Barco‐hunter!

383
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,211
[PIRATES]
Aye aye, sir!

384
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,257
[PIRATES]
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

385
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,092
Monkey, monkey, monkey!
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

386
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,761
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

387
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:37,598
Monkey, monkey, monkey!
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

388
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,601
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

389
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,227
Wow! Awesome!

390
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,687
Completely amazing!

391
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,189
Are you kidding?

392
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,527
[DIVER D]
Forty meters to the target.

393
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,322
Thirty meters.

394
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,448
Twenty.

395
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,117
[DIVER D]
Ten.

396
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,789
[DIVER D]
Barco‐hunter joint locked!

397
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,498
[MASIRA]
Excellent!

398
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,458
Now it's time for me to blow!

399
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,502
[PIRATES]
Aye aye, sir!

400
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,797
Wait. There's no way.

401
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:17,262
He's actually going to use his
breath to bring up that ship?

402
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,557
[NAMI]
That's ridiculous!

403
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,405
[LUFFY]
Is that a bubble?

404
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,251
[DIVER A] The body of
the ship is off the floor.

405
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,920
All right! Haul her up!

406
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,172
[PIRATES]
Aye aye, sir!

407
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,174
Let's hustle, men!

408
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,801
Send more air!

409
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,178
Aye aye, sir!

410
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,854
[DIVERS scream]

411
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,813
[PIRATE B]
Captain!

412
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,315
There's a problem with
the underwater crew!

413
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,358
[MASIRA]
What?

414
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,276
Talk to me!

415
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,194
What's happening down there?!

416
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,654
Is it the intruders?

417
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,196
[DIVER B]
Yes, sir!

418
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,614
They're in the ship!

419
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,243
[screams]

420
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,912
[roars]

421
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,874
How dare you lay a hand
on my hard‐working men!

422
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,376
Intruders!

423
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,342
[NAMI] Uh, you know, we're
not gonna take your picture

424
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,343
or anything.

425
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,428
[MASIRA]
You're not?

426
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,346
[USOPP]
He was giving us a photo op?

427
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:41,930
[DIVER C]
Help us!

428
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:45,267
Someone please, help us!

429
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,476
I'll be right down.

430
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,687
Continue with the
salvaging operation men!

431
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,731
[PIRATES]
Aye aye, sir!

432
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,378
[MASIRA]
Monkey punch!

433
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,466
The salvage looks good.

434
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:21,803
[LUFFY]
Check it out.

435
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,431
We don't even need
the barrels now.

436
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,974
Well, I don't know how
they pumped this much air

437
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,684
into a downed ship.

438
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,853
But what I really want
to know is who they are

439
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,605
and why they're trying
to salvage this thing.

440
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,357
I wonder if something
bad happened to Nami

441
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,359
and Robin up on the surface.

442
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,737
I've tried calling them,
but they won't respond.

443
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,781
Who do you guys think you are?

444
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,617
Trying to muscle in on my turf?

445
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,622
Nice makeup.

446
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,792
Thanks! I feel it adds a
refined quality to my face.

447
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,752
Oh, yeah.
It certainly adds something.

448
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,587
What the hell are
you talking about?

449
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,422
What do you mean?

450
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,049
[SANJI] What he means
to say is, who are you?

451
00:20:59,091 --> 00:20:59,800
[MASIRA]
You're right.

452
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,842
How rude of me.

453
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,428
Sometimes I get caught up
in the details of life.

454
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,055
It's one of my shortcomings.

455
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,474
[ZORO] Come on!
Just tell us who you already!

456
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,772
There's something
else down there.

457
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,482
It's huge!

458
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,567
Anybody just wanna run?

459
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,490
Yeah, all you guys

460
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,326
from the East Blue have the
best sense of humor!

461
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,995
Well, I don't really
know about all that.

462
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,831
Nothing compares to a
one ton gorilla in makeup.

463
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,999
Oh, shut your mouth.

464
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,834
You know I look good.

465
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,564
[NAMI]
Does anyone else see

466
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:59,026
the monster the size of
an island in front of us?

467
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:06,533

[NAMI] What did you
think we'd find out here?

482
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,902
[USOPP]
Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji!

483
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,570
[NAMI]
Calm down and shut up, would ya?

484
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,614
[USOPP] How can you be so
calm when a galleon falls on us

485
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,659
from the sky, we're bombarded
by a giant weird monkey guy?

486
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,953
[NAMI] Why has it gotten dark
in the water all of a sudden?

487
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,704
[USOPP]
Oh, no more. Please!

488
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,456
