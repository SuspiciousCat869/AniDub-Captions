00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,551
[HIRILUK]
I have a favor to ask‐‐

177
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,020
[KUREHA]
I refuse. Anything else?

178
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,756
[HIRILUK]
I haven't even asked it yet!

179
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,692
[KUREHA] So what is
this dust supposed to be?

180
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,861
[HIRILUK] That dust is
30 years of my life...

181
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,929
It's the discovery
I've been searching for!

182
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,898
It'll treat this
country's sickness

183
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,166
and it'll cure it!

184
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,535
You just wasted
30 years of your life...

185
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,437
Nicely done.

186
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,706
Anyway, why you
showing it to me?

187
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,441
I wasn't able
to make enough dust.

188
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,542
There's no time.

189
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,178
I want you to make
cherry blossoms bloom for me.

190
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,179
Nonsense! Why should I waste‐‐

191
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,681
I'm not finished

192
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,883
I want you to teach
Chopper about medicine.

193
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,951
He wants to be a
doctor more than anything.

194
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:26,752
[KUREHA]
Are you mad?

195
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,055
He may be
a reindeer and a freak,

196
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,857
but I know he'll
make a great doctor!

197
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,093
He's a good person
with a kind heart!

198
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,196
He risked his life to
make medicine for me!

199
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:40,199
Please! Help him
become a doctor!

200
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,102
You've sure got
a lot of nerve, you quack!

201
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,237
Why should I take care
of your half‐baked research

202
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,939
and your weird pet?

203
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,241
You know me! I'm not
the type to get all sentimental

204
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,712
just because someone
has a short time to live!

205
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,613
Now get outta my tree!

206
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,787
[HIRILUK]
Yeah... I know...

207
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,789
We've known
each other a long time...

208
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,259
[chuckles]

209
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,728
Goodbye.

210
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,645
This doesn't seem
like you, Hiriluk...

211
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,814
To give up so easily...

212
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,083
[HIRILUK]
I'm almost out of time...

213
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,785
No, he couldn't mean?!

214
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,953
[VILLAGER A]
What do you mean?!

215
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,821
[VILLAGER B]
The 20 MDs are ill?!

216
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,690
[VILLAGER C] Who'll treat
the country's sick people?!

217
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,125
[VILLAGER D]
At least give us medicine!

218
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,292
[SUBORDINATE A]
It's no good talking to us,

219
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,994
we're just telling you,
don't blame us‐‐

220
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,597
[HIRILUK] Everyone get out
of my way! I said move it!

221
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,866
[SOLDIERS screaming]

222
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,501
[SOLDIER A]
That guy's insane!

223
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:53,205
Head for the ropeway...
then the castle...

224
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,542
Where's that damn fool Hiriluk?!

225
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,543
For crying out loud...

226
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,179
You don't have to hide!
I know all about you!

227
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,015
Now where'd that quack
run off to?! Dammit, talk!

228
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:07,019
D‐Doctor got better so he went
into town... That's all...

229
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,622
Better? He can't get
better, his condition can't be

230
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,158
cured by any treatment known
to modern medical science.

231
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,827
[CHOPPER]
That's not true! Look at this!

232
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,696
He's all better now...
because I gave him this to eat!

233
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,332
[gasps]
It can't be!

234
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,569
This is an all‐purpose
medicine, so he's fine now!

235
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,805
He said he felt like
he was full of energy!

236
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,972
[KUREHA growls]

237
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,874
[CHOPPER] Doctor said he was
going to teach me to be‐‐

238
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,209
[KUREHA snarls]

239
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,880
[CHOPPER gasps]

240
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,751
[CHOPPER whimpers]

241
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,852
What was that?!

242
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,022
You stupid fool!

243
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,558
[KUREHA]
Don't you know?!

244
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,227
[KUREHA]
That mushroom!

245
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,831
Huh?

246
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:55,835
[KUREHA sniffles]
It's poison...

247
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,338
Once you eat it...
you're dead in half a day.

248
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,573
[gasps]

249
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:06,345
[KUREHA sobs] That's why that
idiot came to me and...

250
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,880
That can't be true...

251
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,883
I checked in one
of Doctor's books.

252
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,185
Though I guess
I lost the book somehow...

253
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,888
It can defeat all diseases!

254
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,756
[HIRILUK] I raised this flag
as a challenge to all

255
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,725
the diseases of the world!

256
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,393
[CHOPPER] That's right!
There was a skull next to

257
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,730
the picture of the
Amiudake mushroom!

258
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,233
And Doctor said he got better!

259
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:31,237
There's no way he'll die!
You're lying to me!

260
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,707
[HIRILUK]
Stop dawdling! Hurry it up!

261
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,309
I haven't got
any time left to waste!

262
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,312
He was touched by
the kindness of your heart.

263
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,882
The skull in that book
means poison, understand?

264
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,918
‐‐Liar!
‐‐No! Remember it!

265
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,753
There is no known
medicine in this world

266
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,788
that can work for all diseases!

267
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,891
That's why doctors exist!

268
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,659
‐‐But I‐‐
‐‐Listen...

269
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,228
You can't save people
with just kindness.

270
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,396
If you really wanna save them,

271
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,833
you need medical skills and
the training to use them!

272
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,735
Without that,
you can't save anyone!

273
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,069
[CHOPPER whimpers]

274
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,275
[CHOPPER wails]

275
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,414
[KUREHA]
You poor fool...

276
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:20,920
[wailing continues]

277
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,828
[SUBORDINATE B] Lord
Wapol! Hiriluk is headed

278
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:30,963
towards the castle!

279
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:34,099
[WAPOL]
It worked! [laughs] Fool!

280
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,834
[laughs]

281
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:40,506
[DALTON] Is he serious?
Why? What for?

282
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,208
[KUREHA] He'll never
return to this house.

283
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,376
[gasps]

284
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,545
[KUREHA] I guess he chose
the castle to be his tomb...

285
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,149
I demand that you
take me to the patients!

286
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,818
I've come to save the 20 MDs!

287
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,357
‐‐What?
‐‐[WAPOL laughs]

288
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,126
You idiot! Don't you get it yet?

289
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,364
It was a trap! The 20 MDs
are fine, as you can see!

290
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,200
[laughs]

291
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,971
The only life in danger
here is yours, Doctor Hiriluk.

292
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,539
[laughs]

293
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,140
[DALTON]
Why did he come here?

294
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,045
[WAPOL]
Guards... Ready!

295
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,047
[guns cocking]

296
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,217
[CHOPPER pants]

297
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:30,055
[HIRILUK]
So that was it... Good...

298
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,057
Then none of them are sick...

299
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,226
[DALTON gasps]

300
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:38,230
[HIRILUK] I was afraid...
this was a national crisis...

301
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,567
But no...
Luckily, it was just a trick.

302
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,437
[WAPOL] Ha! If it really
was a national crisis,

303
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,674
I wouldn't want someone like
you! Ignore his babbling!

304
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,675
Execute him!

305
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,443
[HIRILUK]
Save your bullets.

306
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,913
You don't have what it
takes to kill someone like me.

307
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,115
[WAPOL]
Huh?

308
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,417
Hey...

309
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,053
When do you think a person dies?

310
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:08,027
[HIRILUK] When a bullet from a
pistol pierces his heart? No...

311
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,098
When he's attacked by
an incurable disease? No...

312
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:18,604
When he eats a soup of
deadly poisonous mushrooms? No!

313
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,541
A man... dies when
people forget him.

314
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,942
[DALTON whimpers]

315
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,611
Even if I should
disappear right now,

316
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,446
my dream will come true.

317
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,948
And when it does, the
citizens' sickness of the heart

318
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,418
will be cured as well.

319
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,286
You're crying...

320
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,289
Why, Dalton?

321
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:41,393
Is that... true for a country?

322
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,163
Yeah, if the will
to do it is passed on.

323
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,965
Come on, Dalton,
why are you crying?

324
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,967
[laughs

325
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,273
Very shortly
a monster will be coming...

326
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:58,077
He's my son...
Please don't hurt him.

327
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:03,148
[HIRILUK]
Don't worry, Chopper...

328
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,350
Your mushroom won't kill me...

329
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,657
I've had... a marvelous life!

330
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,094
[KUREHA]
Goodbye, quack...

331
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,464
[HIRILUK]
Thank you, Chopper!

332
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,058
[CHOPPER gasps]

333
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,067
[WAPOL laughs]

334
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,537
He blew himself up!
What an idiot!

335
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,305
[laughs]

336
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,408
[CHOPPER roars]

337
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,647
‐‐Oh... crap!
‐‐What is that thing?!

338
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,082
[SOLDIER C]
It's a monster!

339
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,050
[SOLDIER D]
Shoot him! Shoot him!

340
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,218
[DALTON]
Stop!

341
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,093
[DALTON]
Leave! Leave here at once!

342
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,696
If you can't even defeat me, you
can't possibly defeat them...

343
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,736
I apologize for
those who had the nerve

344
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,838
to laugh at Hiriluk's death!

345
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,240

[DALTON]
Without enough strength,

347
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,110
you'd only die in vain.

348
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,581
Don't waste your life...

349
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:48,387
Don't sacrifice it
for this country... please.

350
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,588
[WAPOL]
Hm?

351
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,525
[WAPOL]
You let him get away!

352
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,427
[DALTON]
Just shut your mouth!

353
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,362
The only man who
cared enough to try to cure

354
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,532
this sick country has just
died while you laughed!

355
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,635
Even while everyone
else just gave up in despair...

356
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:08,106
This kind doctor attempted
to save us all and died for it!

357
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:11,109
[WAPOL] So what if
someone like that dies?

358
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,312
[DALTON] I've seen the path
this country should take...

359
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,147
It should just die out...

360
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,450
As long as we stay here,
it can't be rebuilt because...

361
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,219
...even if medical
care progresses...

362
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,722
...even if medical
research goes on...

363
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,558
...there is no medicine
that can cure fools!

364
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,329
[WAPOL growls]
I let you have your say...

365
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:34,299
...and... all you've
done is make me angry!

366
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:40,639
[CHOPPER sobs] Please! Please
teach me how to be a doctor!

367
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,774
You've got to teach me
how to become a doctor,

368
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,677
you've got to! I'll become
the all‐purpose medicine!

369
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,313
I'll become a doctor
who can cure anything!

370
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,616
You'll see! I'll even
cure a country!

371
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,586
I'll do anything you ask of me,
but I've got to become a doctor

372
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,488
Because I know
there's no disease,

373
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,791
no illness in this world
that can't be cured!

Call me... Doctorine...

I won't die... I'll carry on...

378
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,542
...his will...

379
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,784
[NAMI] So for the
six years since then...

380
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,787
...Chopper's been studying
medicine under you.

381
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,858
[KUREHA] Yeah. I taught
him everything I know.

382
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,193
He's been a good student.

[CHOPPER]
Doctorine! Doctorine!

384
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,631
It's him!

385
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:44,536
[WAPOL laughs] At long last,
I've finally returned!

386
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,705
The guy with the annoying mouth!

387
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:50,208
Now... we shall
restore Drum Kingdom!

Doctorine! There's trouble!

389
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,513
Wapol is back!
