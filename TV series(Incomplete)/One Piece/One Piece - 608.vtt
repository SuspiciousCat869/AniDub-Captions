00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:12.171
He acts stupid, but I've seen
him use the Conqueror's Haki.

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:15.074
He might have more
potential than Law.

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:20.646
[MONET chuckles]
Wow. Look at you.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.847
Huh?

00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:25.217
That brat? He didn't make
much of an impression before.

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:28.854
[grunts]

00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:32.558
Baby 5 here is armed to the
teeth and itching for a fight.

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:34.326
I'll send her along with Buffalo

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.962
to make certain
things go smoothly.

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:38.264
When this is all over,

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:40.733
come back to
Dressrosa immediately.

00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:41.634
All right.

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:42.902
As you wish.

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:45.705
[laughs]

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:50.776
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL B]
Cu-lick.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.612
I don't know what you guys were
talking about, and I don't care.

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:56.348
I'm gonna catch Caesar,
right now!

00:11:56.382 --> 00:12:00.553
[LUFFY gasps]
What the... It's snowing?

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:04.957
[LUFFY grunts]

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.259
You're not going anywhere.

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:12.298
[LUFFY grunts]

00:12:12.331 --> 00:12:13.699
[laughs]

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.736
[LUFFY] What?
You're making it snow? How?

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:20.139
With the power of the
Snow-Snow Fruit, of course.

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:24.143
The name is rather
self-explanatory. Ha!

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:26.245
[LUFFY grunts]

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:30.883
[MONET] Hm... Well?
How do you like my power?

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:34.487
Why would I be afraid of snow?
Sorry, but your power sucks!

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.357
[MONET laughs] I can be
quite creative, you'll see!

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:43.395
[LUFFY grunts, shouts]

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:47.433

[gasps]

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:59.178
[LUFFY]
Now, Gum-Gum... Pistol!

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:03.149
[LUFFY grunts]
Huh? Huh?

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:05.751
[grunts]

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:10.790
[laughs]

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:33.412
[LUFFY]
Now, Gum-Gum... Pistol!

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.483
[LUFFY grunts]
Huh? Huh?

00:13:39.418 --> 00:13:40.052
[grunts]

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:44.089

[laughs]

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.995
[LUFFY grunts]
Okay, what's next?

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:53.999
I know the accommodations
aren't very comfortable,

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:55.534
but I need you stay put.

00:13:55.568 --> 00:13:57.436
Heh. Now Gum-Gum...

00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:58.737
[MONET]
Igloo.

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.741
[gasps, grunts]

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:11.450
[LUFFY]
Huh. This thing again?

00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:12.651
Hmph.

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:20.059
All right, Second Gear!
You think this is gonna hold me?

00:14:21.627 --> 00:14:24.363
[LUFFY]
Jet Gatling!

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:34.740
[LUFFY]
Huh? Where'd she go?

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.277
[grunts]

[CHILDREN shouting]

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:02.001
[MOCHA sobs]
Okay.

00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:06.005
I get it. I promise I won't
let anyone eat the candy!

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:08.474
Then we can all go
home together, right?

00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:09.675
You bet!

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:12.778
[KONBU]
Open the door, Mocha!

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:14.680
[shouting continues]

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:16.348
[MOCHA gasps]

00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:20.552
[shouting continues]

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.988
[CHOPPER] They're gonna break
through here any second now.

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:25.090
You'd better get
away while you can.

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:27.693
Okay. I'm worried
about you, though!

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:30.529
I'll hold them in here
for as long as I can.

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:32.665
In the meantime, you go
to the Biscuit Room

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:34.099
and throw out all the candy!

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.101
[MOCHA]
Mm. I can try!

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:39.038
[CHOPPER grunts]

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:41.140
[MOCHA gasps]

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:43.309
[CHOPPER]
I'm counting on you, Mocha!

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:44.677
[MOCHA whimpers]

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:48.480

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:04.296
[roars]

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:08.167
This dragon looks like a runt,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.136
but it's actually causing a lot
more damage than the big one.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.571
I like his attitude.

00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:15.841
Get off my back and fight it!
You gotta go stop that thing!

00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:19.712
[DRAGON A roars]

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:23.315
[ROBIN] It's turned this
building into a sea of flames.

00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:25.684
[USOPP gulps]
This is bad, isn't it?

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:27.052
Those tanks are on fire.

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:28.854
What happens if one
of them explodes?

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:30.689
Then they blow a
giant hole in the wall

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:33.425
and all the poison gas
from outside pours in.

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:35.127
I don't care how tough you are.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.063
If that happens, every last
one of us is dead.

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:41.367
Well, okay then.
Anyone want to slay the dragon?

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.268
Look no further, my friend!

00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:46.538
See. I have a score
to settle with dragonkind,

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:49.008
so my fury shall be unbridled!

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:52.778
By the might of this sword,
I do swear,

00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:55.014
the beast shall be destroyed!

00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:56.115
Not so fast!

00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:58.584
That loathsome dragon has
done me a great wrong,

00:16:58.617 --> 00:17:00.819
and I will reclaim
my honor in blood!

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.888
But you just met
the thing today.

00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:06.291
[BROOK gasps]
True, and yet.

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:08.494
Did you not notice its cruelty?

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:09.962
[roars]

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:10.729
Huh?

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:14.233
[yelps]

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:17.736

[DRAGON A sniffs]

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.239
[BROOK]
Huh...? Huh?

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:26.845
[BROOK]
He charged as if to consume me.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.380
Um. Hello?

00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:29.715
Hey!

00:17:29.748 --> 00:17:33.385
Then he turned away, as if
I were some bag of bones!

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:36.021
That's accurate, but it
still hurts, you know!

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.790
Dragons need meat, I'd guess.

00:17:37.823 --> 00:17:38.891
[BROOK growls]

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:41.627
I'll have you know that
bones contain nutrients too!

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.262
[USOPP]
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:44.530
Kin'emon, please.

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:46.999
I insist that you let me
vanquish this dreadful dragon!

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:50.035
I'll take your revenge!
You stand back and watch me!

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:51.036
I'll do it myself!

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.171
You shall not!

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:53.072
I shall too!

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:53.806
You shall not!

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:56.241
I shall sha--I mean...

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:58.544
[roars]

00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:02.314
Come on. Come on! Nin, nin, nin!

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:03.949
Are you casting a spell?

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:05.184
It's what samurai do!

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:06.585
It's ninja, actually.

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:08.253
[DRAGON A roars]

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:09.354
[NAMI]
Here goes!

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:11.857
Thunder Trap!

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.226
[DRAGON A roars]

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:16.728
[gasps]
But that's cheating, Nami!

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:17.963
What a surprise!

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:21.233
Breast Band Girl, you're
proficient in ninja arts?

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:23.135
Don't call me that, you weirdo!

00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:25.771
Get a whiff of the world's
smelliest flower!

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:29.942
Now, special attack!
Green Star: Rafflesia!

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:33.946
[DRAGON A roars]

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:35.147
What?

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.050
The long-nosed goblin commands
frightful sorcery as well?

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:39.485
What did you call me?

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:43.155
Now Cuarenta Fleurs!
Cuatro Mano!

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:47.059
And hold!

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:47.893
[roars]

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:49.695
Are you all powerful ninja?

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:51.864
[roaring]

00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:53.799
[BROOK shouts]

00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:56.869
He's going down!
I'll be the one to finish him!

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:58.770
[KIN'EMON]
You shall do no such thing!

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:02.341

Here we go!

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:10.983
[KIN'EMON]
Follow my lead, Sir Corpse!

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:12.284
I will show you glory!

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:18.790

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.198
He cut fire again.

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:27.366
Splendid work.

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:32.471
But of course.

Now for my Gavotte Bon Avant!

And Flaming Flash!

00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:55.794
Uh! Did you just
call me a corpse?

00:19:55.827 --> 00:19:58.797
Uh! Uh... well,
that's fair enough!

00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.831

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.134
Heh! Nice going!

--[BROWNBEARD] Huh?
--Well, that's that.

So long, you green dummy!

[BROOK] C'mon say it!
Say that bones are delicious!

00:20:10.108 --> 00:20:11.009
I'm waiting!

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:14.446
Puny dragon! Take that!
And another!

[KIN'EMON grunts]

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:18.584
[BROOK]
Uh...

00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:24.256
[KIN'EMON]
Curse you! Curse you! Curse you!

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:26.725
[BROOK] Is there a history
between you and dragons,

00:20:26.758 --> 00:20:27.926
Kin'emon?

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.396
Did one perhaps, eat your family
or something of the sort?

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.266
[growls]

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:38.770
Were that the case, my grudge
could be no greater!

[KIN'EMON pants]

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:45.043
I... think we should go.

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.246
[NAMI] Get your bony butt
back on Brownie's tail

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:48.280
or we'll leave you!

00:20:48.313 --> 00:20:50.716
[BROOK yelps]
Please wait!

00:20:56.154 --> 00:20:58.490
[NAMI] Hey! Just in time!
Look up there!

00:20:58.523 --> 00:20:59.491
[USOPP]
H-Huh?

00:20:59.524 --> 00:21:00.359
[BROWNBEARD]
Hm?

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:01.393

00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:05.597
That doesn't sound good!

[roars]

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:10.969
[CHOPPER growls]

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:14.273
He's in his monster form?
Fighting the kids?

00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:15.474
[BOY B]
Take that!

00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:19.411
I can't even guess
what's going on here.

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:31.823
All done.

00:21:31.857 --> 00:21:37.863
[SUBORDINATE B] Hm? Hm...
Seems you're perfectly healthy.

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:40.065
You can go back to the
Biscuit Room now.

00:21:40.098 --> 00:21:41.066
You mean it?

00:21:41.099 --> 00:21:43.068
[SUBORDINATE B]
Of course. Get some candy.

00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:45.704
[GINKO giggling]
Yay!

00:21:50.642 --> 00:21:54.613
Oh, yeah. Where did that boy go?
He's not here anymore.

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:56.248
[SUBORDINATE B]
Huh? The boy?

00:21:56.281 --> 00:21:57.449
[GINKO]
Mm.

00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:02.254
I saw him go into the
Secret Room,

00:22:02.287 --> 00:22:03.955
where we're not supposed to go.

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.223
And then something
weird happened

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:09.361
and he turned into a dragon.
Momonosuke. You know?

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:18.937
[NARRATOR]
The Bird-like woman, Monte,

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.540
who possesses the power
of the Snow-Snow fruit,

00:22:21.573 --> 00:22:24.943
uses her ability to confine
Luffy within Multiple layers

00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:27.679
of snow and drain
away his energy.

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:30.916
Meanwhile, Law is trapped
in a precarious situation

00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:31.917
of his own.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.685
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:35.687
"Luffy Dies From Exposure?!

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:38.323
The Spine-Chilling
Snow Woman Monet!"

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:41.069
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
