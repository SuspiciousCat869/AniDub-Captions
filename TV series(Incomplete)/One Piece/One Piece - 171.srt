1
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:50,749
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:52,208
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,878
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,546
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:00,050
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:04,429
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,226
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:18,026
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:22,530
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:25,742
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:27,827
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:32,916
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:38,213
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:42,133
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:45,053
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,013
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:52,394
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:54,270
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:59,234
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:01,277
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:07,033
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:14,124
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:21,923
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:41,776
[CHOPPER screams]

25
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,196
I would have been better off
eaten alive at the altar!

26
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:49,617
You have some business with me?

27
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:52,287
[DIVINE D]
Yes, simple business actually.

28
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:54,581
[ROBIN]
Seis Fleurs!

29
00:02:54,664 --> 00:02:56,041
And with a twist.

30
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,673
Such a lack of respect.

31
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,471
[WYPER growls]

32
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,312
Have you ever seen a
Flying Blade Attack?

33
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:23,151
[ZORO]
Thirty-Six Caliber Phoenix!

34
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,622
[NAMI]
It can't be!

35
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:38,708
[ENERU laughs]

36
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:43,546
[LUFFY]
"The Roaring Burn Bazooka!

37
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,341
Luffy vs. War Demon Wyper!"

38
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:51,763
[USOPP cries]

39
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:54,140
What have you done?

40
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:57,519
You... You killed our Sanji!

41
00:03:58,395 --> 00:03:59,813
[USOPP]
It's useless.

42
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:01,147
No pulse.

43
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:04,401
I wish Chopper were here.
He'd know what to do.

44
00:04:04,484 --> 00:04:09,656
Hey! Sanji, Sanji. Sanji!

45
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:12,242
It wasn't supposed
to be this way!

46
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:13,993
Hold on, Usopp!

47
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:16,162
Your checking his
right side for a heartbeat.

48
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:18,873
The left side is
where his heart is!

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,084
[beating heart]

50
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:21,918
[shrieks]

51
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:23,586
He's alive!

52
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,297
Back from the dead.

53
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:28,383
I can't believe it.

54
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:31,052
But he's still not well,
just look at him.

55
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,220
No!

56
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:33,596
You can't die again!

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,974
I need you here!

58
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,274
Eneru!

59
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:47,277
There's no reason
for you to be so resentful.

60
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,697
It's spoiling our beautiful
reunion, don't you think?

61
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,033
It would serve us both
well if you cheered up.

62
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:56,119
Just a little, eh, Gan Fall?

63
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:59,247
[ENERU laughs]

64
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:03,710
Hey! You!

65
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:05,086
I don't know
what you did to him,

66
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,756
but you better not try
any more monkey business!

67
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,009
Or my 8,000 followers
will rip you to shreds!

68
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:12,552
I'll tell you what.

69
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:14,929
I'll forgive you and call off
my hordes of angry followers

70
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:17,390
if you just leave, right now!

71
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:18,475
How's that?

72
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:19,851
'S that sound good?

73
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,644
This is your final warning.

74
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,232
[USOPP]
Huh? It worked.

75
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:27,567
He left.

76
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,905
[USOPP squeaks]

77
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,870
Damn you!

78
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:47,087
You will stay quiet.

79
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,631
Or join your friends.

80
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:52,425
[ENERU]
Am I being clear?

81
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:58,431
Very good.

82
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:01,434
[NAMI]
Who is this guy?

83
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:03,728
And how did he do that?

84
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:05,271
What do you want, Eneru?

85
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:08,942
What wicked reason could you
possibly have for coming aboard?

86
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:11,277
[ENERU] During the six years
I've been on this island,

87
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:14,322
I've kept your former
subordinates very busy.

88
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:17,242
They've been slaving away
for me all these long years,

89
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:19,911
and they've hardly
had a moment to rest.

90
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,417
My Divine Warriors
have been reduced to slaves.

91
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,128
They are most extraordinary.

92
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:30,839
Truly they are of great talent.

93
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:33,967
But it appears that their
years of hard labor are over.

94
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,595
You see, this island
is no longer useful to me.

95
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:40,056
Consequently, I no longer
require the services

96
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,018
of your former Divine Warriors.

97
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:46,396
Perhaps you suspect that I have
sinister motives in coming here,

98
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,815
but I have simply come
to bid you farewell.

99
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:50,900
That is all.

100
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:55,155
[ENERU] I will say this,
sometimes I envy

101
00:06:55,238 --> 00:06:59,200
the blissfull, innocent
stupidity of Skypiea's people.

102
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:01,870
The fools here can only see
this island as nothing more

103
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:04,622
than a clump of
vearth in the sky.

104
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:06,291
[GAN FALL]
What are you talking about?

105
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:07,792
Stupid old man.

106
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:10,170
All these years you never
guessed the true reason

107
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:12,464
we seized this island?

108
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:14,924
The reason that the Blue Sea
flies are here meddling

109
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:17,177
in the islands affairs.

110
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,971
And the reason the Shandorians
fight so bravely to return

111
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:23,683
to their sacred homeland?

112
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:28,229
You see, all this is happening
for one purpose and one alone.

113
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:31,941
There is something here
that they all seek.

114
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,778
[ENERU]
The great treasures of Shandora,

115
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:36,363
the legendary city of gold

116
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:39,657
that prospered on the
Blue Sea so long ago!

117
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:42,994
Gold is what brings us all here!

118
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:46,247
What is gold?

119
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:49,000
And why is it
so important to you?

120
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:51,211
[laughs]

121
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:53,963
Your ignorance never
ceases to amaze!

122
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,341
The only people in the world
who know nothing of gold

123
00:07:56,424 --> 00:07:59,594
or it's value live in the
midst of an untold fortune!

124
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:01,388
You didn't even know
what the goal was,

125
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:03,765
so how could you
have won this game?

126
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:07,602
Interstingly enough, our game of
survival is in it's final play.

127
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,562
Whoever wins, gets the gold!

128
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:13,608
[laughs]

129
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:14,943
Can you hear it now?

130
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,737
The sounds of our
lively little competition?

131
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:25,870
[ENERU] As a matter of fact,
I'm a contestant myself,

132
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:28,790
so I must be off.

133
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,960
Wait, Eneru.
The Divine Warriors.

134
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:35,505
Are you going to set them free?

135
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:37,507
[ENERU]
God only knows.

136
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,676
And he's not telling.

137
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:42,095
[GAN FALL]
Eneru, wait!

138
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:46,641
He disappeared.

139
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:50,103
[USOPP coughs]

140
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:53,940
[NAMI]
Usopp! You're still alive!

141
00:08:58,153 --> 00:08:59,112
[NAMI]
Huh?

142
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:00,447
Ha-ha!

143
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:02,449
Ha-ha!

144
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:18,840
Gum-gum Ba.... lloon!

145
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:37,150
[LUFFY] I can do this
all day if you want,

146
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:38,485
but you can't win.

147
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:41,279
Rifles and cannons won't
leave a scratch on me.

148
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:42,447
Rubber body and all.

149
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,491
[WYPER]
So it would seem.

150
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:46,951
Time for a change of tactics.

151
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:50,288
[LUFFY]
Hmm?

152
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:03,843
Uh... Hmm?

153
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:05,261
Uh...

154
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:07,972
[coughs]

155
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:11,226
Gross! What is that smell?

156
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:13,269
[WYPER] This weapon
is called the burn bazooka.

157
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:15,730
By igniting the gas released
from the breath dial,

158
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:17,774
a deadly blue flame is created.

159
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:21,027
Which will incinerate anything
in it's path instantly.

160
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:24,489
Let's see if you can
bounce this back at me.

161
00:10:32,455 --> 00:10:35,667
[screams]

162
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:43,216
[LUFFY]
What the heck is that thing?

163
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:46,261
It burned right
through that giant tree.

164
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,847
[LUFFY]
Where'd he go?

165
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,932
He disappeared!

166
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,489
[LUFFY]
Gum-gum...

167
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:08,158
...Pistol!

168
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,459
Gum-gum...

169
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,044
...Stamp!

170
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:42,275
That was close.

171
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:45,862
[LUFFY]
Gum-gum...

172
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:47,655
...Spear!

173
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:07,092
[LUFFY]
So you like bazookas, huh?

174
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:09,260
Get a load of this!

175
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:10,929
Now, you die!

176
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:13,431
[LUFFY]
Gum-gum...

177
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:16,434
[WYPER]
Burn...

178
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:22,482
[LUFFY, WYPER]
...Bazooka!

00:12:24,818 --> 00:12:26,319
[LUFFY screams]

180
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:28,571
[screams]

181
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,711
[WYPER]
Straw Hat!

182
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:57,225
[LUFFY]
That bastard's dead.

183
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:27,756
[WYPER]
Where are you, Straw Hat?

184
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:30,091
[WYPER]
I'll find you!

185
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:32,635
I know you're still alive!

186
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:37,349
Yeah!

187
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:40,143
And I plan on stayin' that way!

188
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:59,829
[screams]

189
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:03,667
What the heck is goin' on here?

190
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:12,092
[WYPER]
What is that?

191
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:20,558
[WYPER] Where could
that kid have run off to?

192
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:23,645
[rumbling]

193
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:25,313
[WYPER]
Strange.

194
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,564
No matter.

195
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:28,858
I shouldn't be wasting
my energy on him anyhow.

196
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:31,945
I have a more important battle.

197
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:34,280
All of my strength
needs to be saved

198
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:37,075
if I'm going to win
my fight with Eneru.

199
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:38,118
And I'm certain,

200
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:39,828
if I use the
reject one more time,

201
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:44,374
my body will be reduced
to a pile of ashes.

202
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:47,335
It's the end of the line, Eneru!

203
00:14:58,263 --> 00:15:00,390
So, have you had enough yet?

204
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:03,935
Don't give up now.

205
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,771
We must not let him
get any further!

206
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:07,814
Shut up!

207
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:09,399
I'm after Eneru's head!

208
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:12,193
Make way!

209
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:20,702
Another one?

210
00:15:24,998 --> 00:15:28,418
[GENBOU] Hmph. These
weaklings aren't worth my time!

211
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:37,177
[YAMA] What exquisite
ammunition you have there.

212
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,222
Matter that dense does not
naturally exist here in the sky.

213
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:46,644
[YAMA] The vearth mineral
called iron, isn't it?

214
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:52,776
[YAMA] You have managed to
make quick work of my men,

215
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:55,528
which is a difficult task
to say the least.

216
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,030
My guess...

217
00:15:57,113 --> 00:16:01,951
...is that you are the great
Shandorian warrior, Genbou.

218
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:04,788
Commander Yama, good guess!

219
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:08,625
Now get out of my way!

220
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:12,295
[GENBOU]
Hmm?

221
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:25,684
[groans]

222
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:38,446
[GENBOU]
No!

223
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,574
I refuse to die!

224
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:46,413
Not like this. Not here.

225
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:50,500
[YAMA]
Ah! Still alive I see!

226
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,961
You are tough!

227
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:57,590
Very well, as a gesture of
respect for your warrior spirit.

228
00:16:57,674 --> 00:17:02,637
I will end your suffering
with my secret technique.

229
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:09,853
[GENBOU]
Ten Axe Attack!

230
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:14,649
Damn you, Yama!

231
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,323
[YAMA]
Axe Mountain!

232
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:41,259
So very close, yet,
so very far away.

233
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:46,639
[laughs]

234
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:48,058
[HOTORI]
Ha-haaa!

235
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:50,852
[KOTORI]
Haa-ha!

236
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:53,188
[NAMI]
Who are you guys?

237
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:55,315
[HOTORI]
That's a stupid question!

238
00:17:55,398 --> 00:17:58,068
[HOTORI, KOTORI]
We're Deputy Divine Comanders!

239
00:17:58,151 --> 00:17:59,819
[KOTORI]
You killed our brother Satori!

240
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:01,613
[HOTORI]
Now you're gonna pay!

241
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:02,364
Brother?

242
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:03,782
What do you mean?

243
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:05,909
I haven't killed anybody.

244
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:08,411
[HOTORI, KOTORI]
Ha-haha. Ha-ha!

245
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:12,207
Ha! You can call me Hotori!

246
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,502
Ha! And you can call me Kotori!

247
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:18,713
And you guys killed our
beloved big brother, Satori.

248
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,465
Ha-ha!

249
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:23,426
Sorry to bust your bubble,
but I don't know your bother.

250
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,345
I believe that Satori was one of

251
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:28,264
the four Priests that
served under Eneru.

252
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:33,937
The Lost Forest, was once
their dead brothers domain.

253
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,647
Then, that
must be the Priest

254
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,732
that Luffy and
the guys took out.

255
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,525
Yes.

256
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:40,610
Seems they want revenge.

257
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:41,903
Ha! See!

258
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:44,322
You liars knew who
he was this whole time!

259
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:46,866
Now, you're all gonna pay!

260
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,285
Pierre!

261
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:55,959
We must deal
with these two quickly

262
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:58,044
and return to
the business at hand.

263
00:18:58,128 --> 00:18:59,629
We need to find Eneru

264
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:03,216
and rescue my Divine Warriors
before the unthinkable happens.

265
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:15,186
Now, stand back, young lady!

266
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,356
I may be injured, but I'd never
lose to the likes of those two!

267
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,193
No. I won't stand
back this time.

268
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:23,403
'Cause sometimes I'm the one...

269
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:26,531
...who has to
protect my friends!

270
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:31,119
Very well then.

271
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:34,039
First we need to determine
which dials they possess.

272
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:35,331
All right!

273
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:39,210
Time to avenge our brother!
Time to avenge our brother!

274
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:40,837
Ha-ha!

275
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:58,188
Hey, everything stopped.

276
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:03,401
Huh?

277
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:28,426
[LUFFY]
Where am I?

278
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:35,016
[CHOPPER]
Hello!

279
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,101
C'mon guys!

280
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:37,852
It's me!

281
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:38,812
Are you there?

282
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:41,940
Just answer me, please!

283
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:44,025
I wonder how long it's
gonna take the rest of them.

284
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,568
This is boring.

285
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:50,115
Where is it?

286
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:53,993
Where did it go?!

287
00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:57,205
Uh, Gedatsu, your eyes
are rolled all the way

288
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,707
into the back of your head.

289
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,876
Honestly, how could you expect
to see anything like that?

290
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,753
So careless!

291
00:21:03,837 --> 00:21:07,882
Now, how's your vision?
Can you see this?

292
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,719
Here it is, that puny creature.

293
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,304
He's one of those
Blue Sea dwellers.

294
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:14,973
Is that right?

295
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:17,308
I just thought
it was a raccoon dog.

296
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:18,560
[DIVINE E]
Racoon dog?

297
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:20,603
No. He's nothing like
a wild animal.

298
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:21,646
He walks upright.

299
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,356
That is unquestionably
a creature

300
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,442
that comes from the Blue Sea.

301
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:26,818
Luffy!

302
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:29,571
Where are you hiding?

303
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:30,989
Come on!

304
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:33,783
Wake up already, Zoro!

306
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:37,746
Hurry up, this is getting lame!

307
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,999
Awww. Where is everybody?

308
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:44,044
This is where
we're supposed to meet!

309
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:45,211
Guys!

310
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:46,629
C'mon, I'm lonely,

311
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:49,591
and I'm getting a
little freaked out here!

312
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:58,516

Where'd you go?

313
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,032
Come out right now!
