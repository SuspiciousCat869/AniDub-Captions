00:09:09,974 --> 00:09:11,409
[ZORO] Yeah! Be more
careful with the ship!

172
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:14,445
[USOPP] We're trying to fix
the ship, not destroy it.

173
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:17,982
Hey. Seriously! Oh, c'mon!

174
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,988
[chuckles]

175
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,523
[LUFFY]
That wasn't too hard to find.

176
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:27,491
It‐It's not possible.

177
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,061
How could we lose?

178
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:31,696
Hey you, come back here!

179
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:33,130
You hear me?!

180
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:36,300
You stupid runt!
I'm talking to you!

181
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:39,637
I'll get him! We won't be
beaten by some pretend pirate!

182
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,740
I'll show you a real punch!
Where are you going?

183
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:44,175
[ALL gasp]

184
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,011
Where am I going?

185
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:52,149
Up there.

186
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:05,997
[MIHAWK]
Two minor‐league pirates

187
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,598
beat one of the Warlords.

188
00:10:07,632 --> 00:10:10,601
I bet this is causing
a stir somewhere.

189
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:13,204
I knew I'd hear
those names again.

190
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,440
Monkey D. Luffy.
And Roronoa Zoro.

191
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:21,078
[ZORO] Three‐Sword
Style secret technique!

192
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:23,014
Three Thousand Worlds!

193
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:30,321
Scars on the back are
a swordsman's shame.

194
00:10:30,354 --> 00:10:32,023
Fine.

195
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:38,362
Seek me out! Roronoa Zoro!

196
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,702
Honestly, even I
didn't expect them

197
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:46,737
to come this far so quickly.

198
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,106
We may meet again sooner
than I thought.

199
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,358
[MIHAWK chuckles]

200
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,552
[ELDER A]
Red Hair and Whitebeard?

201
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:21,355
[NAVY HQ GUY]
Yes. Red Hair made contact.

202
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,957
[ELDER A]
That is disturbing.

203
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,192
I assume he didn't go himself?

204
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,228
[NAVY HQ GUY]
No. He sent one of his crew.

205
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:28,729
Elder, I'm concerned.

206
00:11:28,763 --> 00:11:31,065
These two working together
could mean real trouble

207
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:31,732
for the rest of us.

208
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:34,335
Yes, but let's wait for now.

209
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:35,536
They haven't done anything yet,

210
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:39,140
and Red Hair isn't the type
to act unless he's provoked.

211
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:40,341
We'll keep an eye on them,

212
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:43,477
but I'm afraid we have more
pressing worries to tend to.

213
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:46,047
We need to focus on
the Seven Warlords.

214
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,983
With Crocodile gone, we are
in need of a replacement.

215
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:52,253
Pirates they may be, the
Warlords keep things balanced.

216
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:54,021
With one of their number gone,

217
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:56,223
we may encounter
serious problems.

218
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,325
What plans have we made so far?

219
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:59,560
[NAVY HQ GUY]
Sir!

220
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,229
We've called all of the Warlords
to Marie Jois for a meeting,

221
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,031
but there's no way to know
how many of them will

222
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:05,366
actually show up.

223
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,302
They are pirates, after all.
They do as they please.

224
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:09,637
Dammit, Crocodile.

225
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,573
It's because of you
that we're in this mess.

226
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:16,043
We can't let the pirates that
defeated him go unpunished.

227
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:18,145
We have to retaliate swiftly.

228
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:20,781
I want all of our energy
concentrated on finding

229
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:23,284
this Monkey D. Luffy.

230
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:29,190
[NAVAL OFFICER] Navy
Headquarters to Marie Jois:

231
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:31,058
Announcing the arrival
of Warlords

232
00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:34,495
Don Quixote Doflamingo
and Bartholomew Kuma.

233
00:12:45,506 --> 00:12:47,475
[NAVAL OFFICER B]
What the‐‐? Hey, stop it.

234
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:49,176
What are you doing?

235
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,312
It's not me! I don't
know what's going on.

236
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:53,380
This isn't the time
for your stupid pranks.

237
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:54,615
It's no prank.

238
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,684
It's like something's moving my
hands and I can't stop them.

239
00:12:56,717 --> 00:12:58,819
That's ridiculous.
I can't breathe!

240
00:12:58,853 --> 00:13:00,688
[NAVAL OFFICER C] Stop it! What
the devil are you fools doing?

241
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:02,223
[NAVAL OFFICER B]
Are you trying to kill me?

242
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:04,091
[NAVAL OFFICER A]
Look, I told you, it's not me!

243
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,793
[NAVAL OFFICER C] Control
yourselves! Stop this now!

244
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,129
[NAVAL OFFICER A]
Get off me!

245
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,797
[growls] This is your doing!

246
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,733
Do you find this
entertaining, Doflamingo?

247
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:15,469
[DOFLAMINGO]
Hm. Yes, actually.

248
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,272
If you don't mind, I'd like to
get this little shindig started

249
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:20,541
sometime in the near future.

250
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:22,543
Unless you haven't had enough.

251
00:13:26,147 --> 00:13:27,314
[yells]

252
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,182
[NAVAL OFFICER B]
You idiot!

253
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:29,216
What do you think
you're doing now?

254
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,518
[NAVAL OFFICER C]
This foolishness has gone on

255
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:32,453
long enough, Doflamingo!

256
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:34,288
[SENGOKU]
Stop! Enough!

257
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:35,389
There's no time for this.

258
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:39,093
Now sit down. There are
pressing matters to discuss.

259
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,836
I apologize for
the late welcome.

260
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,139
Thank you for coming,
scum of the sea.

261
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:53,307
Thank you.

262
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,844
So thoughtful of you, using
my formal title like that.

263
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,845
[SENGOKU]
Let's begin.

264
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:01,382
I doubt any more of the
Warlords plan to attend.

265
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:04,585
Truth be told, two out of six
is more than I expected.

266
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:05,719
[DOFLAMINGO]
Smart man.

267
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:06,720
I didn't plan to come either,

268
00:14:06,754 --> 00:14:08,889
but the business back
home's going so well,

269
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:13,894
it practically runs itself,
so I took a vacation.

270
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:16,430
Ended up here out
of sheer boredom.

271
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:19,266
Forgive me for not applauding
your business success.

272
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,734
I'm afraid that,
for the rest of us,

273
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:22,570
there are few things
more distressing

274
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:23,871
than a booming pirate industry.

275
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,240
[chuckles]

276
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:29,710
While I admire a man who's
not afraid to speak his mind,

277
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:33,714
I would remember, Admiral,
that there are limits.

278
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,717
[footsteps]

279
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,155
[MIHAWK] So good to hear your
dulcet tones again, Doflamingo.

280
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:44,291
And you, Admiral Sengoku,
I hope you've been well.

281
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:45,793
[NAVAL OFFICER A]
Hawk‐Eye!

282
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:47,528
I must say,
I've never understood

283
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:49,396
why the Seven Warlords
and the Marines

284
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,298
insist on pretending
they get along,

285
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:52,900
but perhaps you
can enlighten me.

286
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,168
Hawk‐Eye Mihawk.

287
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:57,638
Perhaps this little get‐together
will be interesting after all.

288
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:59,607
What brings you here, Mihawk?

289
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,642
Well, I heard about your meeting

290
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:03,477
and thought I might
sit in on it.

291
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,813
I have an interest in the
pirates you'll be discussing,

292
00:15:05,846 --> 00:15:08,482
and I'd like to stay informed.

293
00:15:08,515 --> 00:15:10,217
That is all.

294
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:12,553
[LAFITTE] Forgive the intrusion,
but if Hawk‐Eye's staying,

295
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:15,656
perhaps you won't mind adding
one more to the party.

296
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:16,724
I will tell you though,

297
00:15:16,757 --> 00:15:20,494
my intentions are a bit
less passive than his are.

298
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:21,962
Who are you, exactly?

299
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:24,465
And how'd you get
in here anyway?

300
00:15:24,498 --> 00:15:25,799
[LAFITTE]
Quite a prestigious group

301
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,668
you 've assembled here, Admiral.

302
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:29,536
I'm truly impressed.

303
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,839
I was hoping I might join you.

304
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:35,209
Huh?

305
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:37,945
[LAFITTE] I heard the
news about Crocodile.

306
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:44,318
It's a terrible shame he's gone.

307
00:15:44,351 --> 00:15:46,820
Fortunately for you, I've come
here to offer a solution

308
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:48,455
to your little problem.

309
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,923
"The Six Warlords"
just doesn't have

310
00:15:49,957 --> 00:15:53,294
the same ring to it, does it?

311
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,330
I know him! That man's Lafitte!

312
00:15:56,363 --> 00:15:57,331
Who's Lafitte?

313
00:15:57,364 --> 00:16:00,567
Ah‐ha. Someone here has
heard my name before.

314
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:02,736
I'd have thought it
had been forgotten.

315
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,306
A long time ago, he was
a respected peace officer

316
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,440
in the West Blue Sea.

317
00:16:06,473 --> 00:16:09,877
He disappeared after a scandal
ruined his reputation.

318
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,913
[LAFITTE] Glad to see
you're so well‐informed.

319
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:16,350
Who I am doesn't matter.
All that's in the past.

320
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,452
I've come here to talk to
you about another man.

321
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:19,353
One who I believe would make

322
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:22,456
an excellent addition
to the Warlords.

323
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:24,958
[WHITEBEARD]
Shanks.

324
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:28,295
I haven't heard that
name in a long time.

325
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:32,666
So, after all these years,
he's sent me a letter?

326
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,668
Yeah, and whatever it
says must be important

327
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,271
or else he wouldn't have chosen
me to deliver it for him.

328
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:40,307
[WHITEBEARD] I see. You're high
up on the food chain, are you?

329
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:41,408
Well, uh, not exactly.

330
00:16:41,442 --> 00:16:44,611
I mean I am still new
to the Red‐Haired Pirates...

331
00:16:46,013 --> 00:16:48,349
But it's not like this
is my first pirate gig.

332
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,350
I've been around for a while,

333
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,653
and I'm pretty sure I've
made a name for myself.

334
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:53,821
Hey, you guys have heard about

335
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:56,590
that famous pirate
named Rockstar, right?

336
00:16:56,623 --> 00:16:58,892
Uh‐uh. I've never
heard of him before.

337
00:16:58,926 --> 00:17:01,295
[BOTH chattering]

338
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:01,995
[paper ripping]

339
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:03,364
[gasps]

340
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:06,533
Hey! What are you‐‐?

341
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,869
[WHITEBEARD]
He sent me a letter?

342
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,904
When did that kid
become so important

343
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:14,541
that he thought it would be
okay to send me a letter?

344
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,810
Time to take him down a notch.

345
00:17:16,844 --> 00:17:18,545
[ROCKSTAR]
Wait! Hold on!

346
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,649
What do you think you're doing?
That was an important letter.

347
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:24,385
This is Shanks you're
dealing with‐‐

348
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,520
the leader of the
Red‐Haired Pirates!

349
00:17:26,553 --> 00:17:29,056
You forget, I'm
Captain Whitebeard.

350
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,894
Captain, it's time for
your medicine again.

351
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,597
[WHITEBEARD] I've got all the
medicine I need right here!

352
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,799
Now silence! Fetch
me another keg!

353
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:42,436
I hope you know my boss will
hear about all of this!

354
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,505
[WHITEBEARD]
Don't make me laugh.

355
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:46,607
Anyway, I already have
a pretty good idea

356
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,108
of what the letter's about.

357
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:51,845
He's worried about
Blackbeard and that kid Ace.

358
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:53,714
Tell Shanks that if
he wants to talk,

359
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:56,483
he can come see me himself.

360
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:58,752
Now, why don't you take off?

361
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,923
I'm too busy to talk to
a snot‐nosed rookie.

362
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,092
Run home to your boss.

363
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,036
[SHANKS laughing]

364
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:18,672
[SHANKS] The old man
hasn't changed a bit.

365
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:21,375
[ROCKSTAR] How are you
laughing at this, boss?

366
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:22,776
[laughing]

367
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,413
I figured that would happen.
Don't worry about it.

368
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:28,482
[ROCKSTAR] Just give me
a little bit more time.

369
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:31,084
I promise, I can
straighten this guy out.

370
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:32,820
[SHANKS] I don't know what you
planned to do, my friend,

371
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:34,421
but forget about it.

372
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:36,423
You did a good job.

373
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:39,626
Now just get yourself
back to base, all right?

374
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,028
[ROCKSTAR]
B‐But what about my pride?

375
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:43,030
I have to show
this guy who I am!

376
00:18:43,063 --> 00:18:45,799
Hey, your life is more important
to me than your pride.

377
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,068
Come on, there's nothin' more
for you to do out there.

378
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:50,471
And we have some things to plan.

379
00:18:51,939 --> 00:18:54,908
So, what're we
going to do, boss?

380
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:57,711
We're going. Prepare
to set sail, men!

381
00:18:57,744 --> 00:18:59,880
You're going to see Whitebeard?

382
00:18:59,913 --> 00:19:00,881
[SHANKS]
Sure am.

383
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:02,916
Even you can't think the
government won't react

384
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,052
if you pull a stunt like that.

385
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:07,988
No, Beckman,
I fully expect them to.

386
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,758
I just don't care.

387
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,094
Now's not the time to worry
about the government.

388
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:18,131
Before much longer, they'll be
the ones worrying about us.

389
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:20,968
You heard him, men.
Let's get goin'!

390
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:25,205
All right, boys. Let's get some
grog ready to take with us.

391
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,736
[SENGOKU]
Teach?

392
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:31,870
That's right.

393
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,840
He's the captain of the pirate
crew to which I belong.

394
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,708
Tell me, if I've
never heard of him,

395
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,210
what use is he to me?

396
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,946
With no reputation,
he would pose no threat.

397
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:44,349
[LAFITTE] You know, I thought
you might feel that way.

398
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,319
And I assure you, we need
only a little bit more time.

399
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,720
We are drawing up a
plan at the moment

400
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,522
that should take
care of everything.

401
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,890
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

402
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,859
[DOFLAMINGO] Well, he's
caught my interest anyway.

403
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,195
Why don't we give
him a try, Admiral?

404
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,396
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

405
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,699
The crew I belong to is known
as the Blackbeard Pirates.

406
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,669
I suggest that you
remember that name.

407
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,641
[MAN C]
Hey, did you hear?

408
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,243
Someone beat up Bellamy earlier!

409
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,412
[MAN D]
What? Who could do that?

410
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,552
[TEACH]
This kid looked too bright‐eyed

411
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,654
to even be worth 30 million.

412
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,590
But 100 million?

413
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,226
So what's our next
move, Captain?

414
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,363
The kid just got lucky‐‐
he's not really worth that much.

415
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,999
Why don't you throw that away
before I do it for you?

416
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,901
[TEACH]
That's enough outta you!

417
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,643
Well, that oughta shut him up.

418
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,646
I was looking for someone with a
bounty that was worth my time.

419
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,880
[laughs]

420
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,584
The crew's going to be rich
soon, boys. Very stinkin' rich.

421
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,019
That's what I wanted to hear!

422
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:57,489
It's about time that we all
had full pockets again.

423
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,591
Hey, Captain!

424
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,027
Weren't we meeting up
with Lafitte in Mock Town?

425
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,696
I haven't seen him
around anywhere.

426
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,768
Guess we'll just have
to leave without him.

427
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,504
We can't let a bounty
like that get away.

428
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,640
Am I right, Auger?

429
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,342
[laughing]

430
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,987
Good Idea. We gotta do all
the livin' we can right now.

431
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,557
Death comes for everyone
some time, even pirates.

432
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,773
[LUFFY] Don't worry, Pops,
I got your gold back.

433
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,909
And I'll be there by
sunrise, I promise.

434
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,911
Please let him be okay.

435
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:56,748
Just hold on, Pops. Hold on!

I'm getting scared here.

451

[CHOPPER] The ship's being
sucked into a whirlpool!

452
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,136

Nobody mentioned this!

I think it's about time
to turn around, Luffy!

454
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,007

island in the sky, who cares?
