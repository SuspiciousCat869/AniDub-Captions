[ZORO] I guess losing to me once
wasn't enough for you, huh?

178
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:14,213
I told you to get outta my way,
you drooling tub of lard!

179
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,114
Now move!

180
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,149
[BUTCHIE yelling]

181
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,383
[bang]

182
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,690
Wait... What was that sound?

183
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,359
[KURO] That is the
sound of destruction.

184
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,462
Jango's probably tearing
the place apart.

185
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,733
Go ahead. See for yourself
if you can get up.

186
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:47,640
Heartless bastard! Don't you
even have a shred of pity?

187
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,975
You lived with that
girl for three years!

188
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,711
[KURO]
No. I've told you,

189
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:55,715
Kaya is nothing more than a pawn
in the game I intend to win.

190
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,951
When she's dead, then
I'll be grateful to her.

191
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,955
[USOPP]
Damn you!

192
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,890
[ZORO]
This guy is hopelessly evil.

193
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,493
[LUFFY] We should put
him out of his misery.

194
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,663
Hey!

195
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,067
Usopp! Go find the others!

196
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,771
Don't worry, we'll
take care of this guy.

197
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:19,972
Go on.

198
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:50,536
[USOPP groaning]

199
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,976
[KURO]
Ah.

200
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:00,312
Very impressive.
You can still move.

201
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,648
[USOPP]
Shut up!

202
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,484
You won't get away with this!

203
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,952
I won't let you!

204
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,555
You betrayed the villager's
trust. Not to mention

205
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,893
you planned to take the life
of a sweet young girl!

206
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,363
This is the last time
you ever get your way!

207
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,632
[USOPP groaning]

208
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:20,866
Usopp!

209
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:31,644
It hurts... It hurts
so bad, I can't move.

210
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:38,017
[laughing]

211
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,686
[KURO]
You really are a riot.

212
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,855
So I betrayed them, you say.

213
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,090
Oh, please! Grow up!

214
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,092
That was all part of the plan.

215
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,829
A village liar who plays
pirates with the local kids

216
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,432
has no place talking
like a real pirate!

217
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,768
Just stay on the ground there.

218
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:01,373
[JANGO] Hah. Even if you
did somehow catch up to Jango,

219
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,009
he'd end your life
in the blink of an eye.

220
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,111
Staying there is
what's best for you.

221
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,713
[JANGO laughs]

222
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,549
[USOPP]
I don't care.

223
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,752
I don't care that I'm weak.
I'll protect them.

224
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:17,456
I'm Captain of
the Usopp Pirates.

225
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,726
A brave warrior of the sea who
fights for what he holds dear!

226
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,396
I will protect everyone in
the village if it kills me!

227
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:30,536
On my word, you will never
set foot in that village!

228
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,375
[PIRATE H]
What's his deal?

229
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,943
[PIRATE I]
He's yellin' about something!

230
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,778
[PIRATE J]
Check it out he's crying!

231
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:45,584
[PIRATES laughing]

232
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,454
[PIRATES yelping]

233
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,827
What's so funny?!

234
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:58,597
[ZORO]
Luffy!

235
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,433
Me and Usopp are gonna
chase down that hypno freak.

236
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,635
Is that a problem?

237
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,470
[LUFFY]
No. Hurry!

238
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,105
Hey. Thank you.

239
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,008
I'd be a whole lot faster
if I was going by myself.

240
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,809
But I don't know those woods,

241
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,812
so if we're gonna catch up to
them, I'm gonna need your help.

242
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,849
Hold it you two. Where
do you think you're going?

243
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,485
Who gave you permission
to go anywhere?

244
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,754
[LUFFY]
I did!

245
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,456
Usopp! Zoro! Get goin'!

246
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,327
[LUFFY]
Have another!

247
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,867
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum!

248
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,802
Spear!

249
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,105
[LUFFY]
Man, he disappeared again!

250
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,942
[LUFFY]
The others got away.

251
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,010
That's the most
important thing, really.

252
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:49,148
[KURO] Before I kill you,
I feel compelled to ask.

253
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,883
What is an outsider like you

254
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,953
butting into this
villages' business for?

255
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,021
[chuckles] Because there's
a man in this village

256
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,990
that I don't wanna let die.

257
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,159
[chuckles] Simple enough.

258
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,529
Are you okay with that
being the reason that you die?

259
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,730
Sure am.

260
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,166
Ha! But I'm not gonna die!

261
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,168
We'll see about that.

262
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,039
[LUFFY yelling]

263
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:20,079
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum Whip!

264
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,181
And Pistol!

265
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,154
This is quite boring!

266
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,024
You cocky jerk!

267
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,900
[LUFFY]
Owww.

268
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,535
He nicked me.

269
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,037
Kuro laid him out flat.

270
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,539
Lotta good that
Devil Fruit did him.

271
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,909
Yeah. That's Captain
Kuro for ya.

272
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:56,882
[PIRATES cheering]

273
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,052
Shut up. Don't call me that!

274
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,787
[PIRATES]
Huh?

275
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,890
[KURO]
You still don't get it.

276
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,760
You fools. This whole
plan was devised,

277
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:12,564
so that I may be rid of that
name once and for all.

278
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,567
I'm tired of it.

279
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,437
Concocting plans everyday
for a bunch of barbarians

280
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,440
who care only about
havoc and mayhem.

281
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,575
Relentlessly attacked
by government dogs

282
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,377
and bounty hunters.

283
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,412
I'm tired of it.

284
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:30,382
I am sick and tired
of that entire cursed life!

285
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:34,420
[explosion]

286
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,589
[KURO]
The Navy, huh?

287
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:41,593
This is the third
time this week.

288
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,429
Well, can you really blame them?

289
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,897
You're one of the
most famous pirates

290
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,999
sailing the seas right now.

291
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,735
Captain Kuro is a superstar.

292
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,437
[KURO]
You're right.

293
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,607
My infamy is what
draws them to us.

294
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,911
That's why I'm going to
give up being Captain Kuro.

295
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,013
[explosion]

296
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,982
Yeah, wouldn't that be nice.

297
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,852
Except... the Marines
won't stop their pursuit

298
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,654
until Captain Kuro is dead.

299
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,991
[explosion]

300
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,928
[KURO]
I am going to die.

301
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,630
It would seem that the
tumultuous life of a pirate

302
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,033
just isn't for me.

303
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,468
[JANGO]
You can't quit, sir.

304
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,136
You're the ship's captain.

305
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,639
[KURO]
You can be captain now.

306
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,843
I have finally grown
weary of this life.

307
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:38,016
It's over. I'm killing
myself for all to see.

308
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,551
Sir! Captain Kuro!

309
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,385
Captain!

310
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,487
Captain!

311
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,055
[KURO]
How many vessels are there?

312
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,890
One! Just one this time.

313
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,392
What should we do, Captain?!
Should we man the cannons?!

314
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,794
We could blast
them to splinters!

315
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,063
[KURO] Lower a small
boat into the water.

316
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:51,997
[PIRATE S]
What?!

317
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,832
[KURO]
A boat! Now!

318
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,405
[PIRATE S]
Vice Captain Jango!

319
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,073
Captain Kuro just‐‐!

320
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,508
[JANGO]
Yeah, I know.

321
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,575
[PIRATE O]
"Yeah, I know"?

322
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,978
It's too dangerous for him
to go there by himself!

323
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,514
[PIRATE S] Don't tell me
he's turning himself in.

324
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:20,759
[PIRATES whimpering]

325
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,530
[PIRATE R]
What?!

326
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,031
[PIRATE G]
The cannon fire stopped.

327
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,499
[PIRATE H]
What's goin' on?

328
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,168
[PIRATE I]
This is weird.

329
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,906
[JANGO]
Prepare to board the ship.

330
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,607
[PIRATE T]
But... sir! Shouldn't we‐‐?

331
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,010
I didn't ask for your
opinion. That's an order.

332
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,044
[PIRATE T]
Yes, sir!

333
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:39,878
[PIRATE R]
Better get ready...

334
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,714
[JANGO] I see.
So that's why you‐‐

335
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,883
‐‐[PIRATE H] On three!
‐‐[PIRATES yell]

336
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,718
You there! Hey!

337
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,121
Uh, Yes, sir! What is it, sir?

338
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,090
Good bye. It was nice
knowing you, sailor.

339
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,545
[PIRATE T]
The Marines.

340
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,447
[PIRATE V]
They've been wiped out.

341
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,923
[KURO]
Now then.

342
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,661
[KURO]
Let's begin this plan.

343
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,903
C'mon, pull yourself together.

344
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:41,940
I was kind enough to let
you and you alone survive.

345
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,943
Just... do it.

346
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,013
I'm not kneeling to you

347
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,783
Finish me off and
get it over with.

348
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,986
‐‐[thud]
‐‐[MORGAN groans]

349
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,988
You'll be perfect.

350
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,624
If you can still howl this
much with a shattered jaw,

351
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,092
you should do fine.

352
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,761
[chuckles]

353
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,264
Today is the greatest
day of your life.

354
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,967
Today is the day you
captured Captain Kuro.

355
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,937
You should be ever
so grateful to me.

356
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,275
I'm giving you, the
head of Captain Kuro.

357
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,810
[JANGO]
Your name is Captain Kuro.

358
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,680
Your name is Captain Kuro.

359
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,516
This atrocity was your doing.

360
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,053
One. Two. Jango!

361
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,825
My name is Captain Kuro.
This atrocity was my doing.

362
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,527
[JANGO]
And you are the brave Marine

363
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,196
who caught the
infamous Captain Kuro.

364
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,066
Return to base and see
that he gets executed.

365
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,568
One. Two.

366
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,170
Jango!

367
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:49,007
I am the brave Marine who caught
the infamous Captain Kuro!

368
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,710
[PIRATE W] You're doing
it again, Vice Captain.

369
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,911
[KURO]
Perfect.

370
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,846
When my double gets executed,

371
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,149
Captain Kuro will
disappear from the earth

372
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:00,018
and I will live
the life I deserve.

373
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,022
[KURO]
And when my plan succeeds today,

374
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:07,159
after three years of planning,
revising, and waiting;

375
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,329
my goal will be achieved
in its entirety.

376
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,732
Wealth and peace of mind
will finally be mine.

377
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,867
Do you understand now, boy?

378
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,003
I will not allow
this perfect plan,

379
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,006
years in the making, to fail!

380
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,210
My plan will not be disrupted
by an urchin like you!

381
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,019
It would seem that you can do
a lot more than just stretch.

382
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,053
[LUFFY]
That's right!

383
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:38,790
I've been toughening
myself up to be a pirate!

384
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:46,398
You know what?
Don't want a reputation?

385
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:49,101
Then don't be a pirate!

386
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,072
[chuckles]

387
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:58,810
You're just greedy, Kuro.
But I have ambition!
