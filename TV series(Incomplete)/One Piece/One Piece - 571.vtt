WEBVTT

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.071
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.113
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.281
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.151
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.320
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.255
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:26.459
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.984
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.018 --> 00:02:39.921
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:39.954 --> 00:02:45.092
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.126 --> 00:02:47.628
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:47.662 --> 00:02:50.865
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:50.898 --> 00:02:52.800
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:55.236
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.939
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.473 --> 00:03:02.510
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.543 --> 00:03:04.212
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.245 --> 00:03:07.882
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:07.915 --> 00:03:12.086
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:16.257
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.026
Luffy and his crew
arrive on Fishman Island,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.463
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:25.967
There, they found themselves
facing the New Fishman Pirates,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.636
who were looking to destroy
the Ryugu Kingdom,

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.272
and instigated an all-out war.

00:03:32.273 --> 00:03:34.308
[NARRATOR] After a long
and grueling battle,

00:03:34.342 --> 00:03:36.310
Luffy finally defeated Hordy,

00:03:36.344 --> 00:03:38.546
the captain of the
New Fishman Pirates,

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.082
thwarting their
plan for revenge.

00:03:43.317 --> 00:03:46.554
There is still much you
do not know. Listen closely.

00:03:46.587 --> 00:03:49.590
Before you reach the New
World, you must be aware of

00:03:49.624 --> 00:03:52.159
two key changes that
have occurred there.

00:03:53.527 --> 00:03:54.895
Now then, the first matter,

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:56.998
as I've already
begun to explain,

00:03:57.031 --> 00:03:59.667
is that the Navy under
Fleet Admiral Sakazuki

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.535
is stronger than before.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.005
And secondly...

00:04:04.038 --> 00:04:07.074
...the Blackbeard Pirates are
making strides of their own.

00:04:07.108 --> 00:04:09.410
[CARIBOU screams]

00:04:09.443 --> 00:04:10.578
[thud]

00:04:10.611 --> 00:04:14.382
[CARIBOU screaming]

00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:15.516
[NAMI]
You idiots just had to

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.151
kick him into next
week, didn't you?

00:04:17.184 --> 00:04:19.654
Why couldn't you just knock him
out and tie him up in the tower?

00:04:19.687 --> 00:04:20.354
[ZORO, LUFFY scream]

00:04:20.388 --> 00:04:22.023
Oh, Nami, you're so cute when--

00:04:22.056 --> 00:04:23.557
[thudding]

00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:25.059
[NAMI]
Go catch him and bring him back!

00:04:25.092 --> 00:04:28.829
[ALL yelling]

00:04:28.863 --> 00:04:31.399
They're here to
collect for Big Mom.

00:04:31.432 --> 00:04:33.567
We can't face them now!

00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:36.070
We don't have any sweets
for this month's payment.

00:04:36.103 --> 00:04:39.040
Hordy and his lackeys
tore the factory apart.

00:04:39.073 --> 00:04:40.641
And all the candy
we could salvage

00:04:40.675 --> 00:04:43.511
was sent to the banquet so
the Straw Hats could enjoy it!

00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:45.613
What should we do?

00:04:45.646 --> 00:04:47.782
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Hmm.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.651
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Something tells me

00:04:50.685 --> 00:04:52.553
Big Mom of the Four Emperors

00:04:52.586 --> 00:04:56.157
won't be satisfied
with an apology.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.361
That woman would level an
entire country for sweets!

00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:09.070
[LUFFY] "She Loves Sweets!
Big Mom of the Four Emperors!"

00:05:12.073 --> 00:05:13.808
[NARRATOR]
After much celebration,

00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:16.544
the banquet finally
comes to an end.

00:05:16.577 --> 00:05:20.281
[USOPP] They're seriously gonna
let us keep all that treasure?!

00:05:20.314 --> 00:05:21.849
[CHOPPER]
Cool!

00:05:21.882 --> 00:05:23.651
[FRANKY]
That's pretty generous!

00:05:23.684 --> 00:05:26.554
Do you think Luffy and the
others are all right, Nami?

00:05:26.587 --> 00:05:27.922
I'm so worried.

00:05:27.955 --> 00:05:29.423
[NAMI]
Eh, they're fine.

00:05:29.457 --> 00:05:32.159
We're gonna be
fancy rich pirates now!

00:05:32.193 --> 00:05:33.027
Whoo!

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.096
It sounds nice,
but something tells me

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:36.931
this is too good to be true.

00:05:36.964 --> 00:05:37.932
[CHOPPER]
Hey, Usopp!

00:05:37.965 --> 00:05:40.167
Why don't we go look for
the treasure thief, too?

00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:41.869
[USOPP]
Uhh, how about no?

00:05:41.902 --> 00:05:44.638
I found out that guy's
bounty is over 200 million,

00:05:44.672 --> 00:05:46.640
so he's not gonna be
an easy target.

00:05:46.674 --> 00:05:49.176
[CHOPPER] Whoa!
And mine's only 50 berries.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.446
[LUFFY]
Hey, Zoro, Sanji, check it out!

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.048
Easiest treasure hunt ever!

00:05:54.081 --> 00:05:57.118
[SANJI] That one punch
knocked him out cold.

00:05:57.151 --> 00:05:59.153
I almost feel bad for him.

00:05:59.186 --> 00:06:02.456
[ZORO] And he left all this
loot sitting out in the open.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.658
[SANJI] Neptune's gonna
let us keep all this?

00:06:04.692 --> 00:06:06.761
Guess he really is
as goofy as he looks.

00:06:06.794 --> 00:06:07.828
Awesome!

00:06:07.862 --> 00:06:10.064
How much meat do you
think this'll buy?

00:06:10.097 --> 00:06:12.533
[ZORO] To think his body
could hold all this.

00:06:12.566 --> 00:06:15.636
I mean, I know he's made
of sludge, but still.

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.739
[ALL grunting]

00:06:20.975 --> 00:06:23.344
[LUFFY, ZORO, SANJI]
One, two, three!

00:06:23.377 --> 00:06:25.780
[ALL groan]

00:06:25.813 --> 00:06:27.648
[LUFFY] Let's take it
back to the palace!

00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:28.816
[ZORO]
How?

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:30.518
[SANJI]
We need a flying fish.

00:06:30.551 --> 00:06:32.420
[LUFFY]
Which way to town, Zoro?

00:06:32.453 --> 00:06:33.487
[ZORO]
That way.

00:06:33.521 --> 00:06:35.289
[SANJI] Or we could always
run off with the loot.

00:06:35.322 --> 00:06:36.090
[ZORO]
What?

00:06:36.123 --> 00:06:39.727
[LUFFY laughs]

00:06:42.596 --> 00:06:44.632
[PEKOMS]
Well, Minister of the Left?

00:06:44.665 --> 00:06:47.234
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Please have mercy, Mr. Pekoms!

00:06:47.268 --> 00:06:49.503
Hordy and his crew
attacked the factory,

00:06:49.537 --> 00:06:51.505
and now we don't
have any candy left!

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.843
[PEKOMS] And what makes any
of that our problem? Grr!

00:06:55.876 --> 00:06:58.078
You're supposed to pay
us in candy each month

00:06:58.112 --> 00:07:00.381
in exchange for
using Mama's name!

00:07:00.414 --> 00:07:03.350
Don't tell me you've forgotten
about our little agreement?

00:07:03.384 --> 00:07:06.187
And I was planning on taking
some sweets for myself,

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.058
which means now I'm
mad and hungry! Grrr!

00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:13.594
We've done business
with you for a long time,

00:07:13.627 --> 00:07:15.930
so I hate to say this, but...

00:07:15.963 --> 00:07:17.364
...I don't think I
need to remind you

00:07:17.398 --> 00:07:21.368
how scary Mama can be
when she's angry.

00:07:21.402 --> 00:07:23.337
She'll kill you!

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.840
[CROWD]
Look at those cute little eyes.

00:07:25.873 --> 00:07:28.742
[PEKOMS]
You'd better pay up! Right now!

00:07:28.776 --> 00:07:31.145
[LUFFY]
Huh? What's goin' on?

00:07:33.147 --> 00:07:36.984
[LUFFY] Hey, this is the candy
factory Pappagu told me about!

00:07:37.017 --> 00:07:37.985
[ZORO]
Yeah?

00:07:38.018 --> 00:07:40.254
Hopefully we can find a
flying fish around here.

00:07:40.287 --> 00:07:41.622
This must be the
place where they make

00:07:41.655 --> 00:07:43.424
that candy I like so much!

00:07:43.457 --> 00:07:44.692
Hey, guys!

00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:46.427
Are you gonna give us
the grand tour?

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.561
[CROWD]
Huh?

00:07:47.595 --> 00:07:49.897
[FISHMAN D]
Ho, ho! Straw Hat Luffy!

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.465
Omigod, hi!

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:53.801
Like, is the banquet over?

00:07:53.834 --> 00:07:56.303
Luffy? Why is he here?

00:07:56.337 --> 00:07:59.273
Uh-huh! Dude,
I totally pigged out, too!

00:07:59.306 --> 00:08:01.709
Fishman Island's got all
kinds of delicious food,

00:08:01.742 --> 00:08:04.111
but that candy was unbelievable!

00:08:04.144 --> 00:08:06.313
[ALL gasp]

00:08:06.347 --> 00:08:08.048
[PEKOMS]
Grr. What's that?

00:08:08.082 --> 00:08:10.184
[CROWD]
Shhh! Shh!

00:08:10.217 --> 00:08:12.520
Whoa, whoa, ixnay
on the andy-cay!

00:08:12.553 --> 00:08:13.988
[RANDOM FISHMAN 471D]
Don't say anything!

00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:17.391
Oh! Hey, it's Mr. Catfish.
What are you up to?

00:08:17.424 --> 00:08:21.228
He said candy!
Just who is this guy?

00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:29.003
[PEKOMS] Huh. That's Straw
Hat Luffy, no doubt about it.

00:08:29.036 --> 00:08:30.771
He's got no business here.

00:08:30.804 --> 00:08:32.006
He's a pirate, right?

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.507
Well, sir, you see...

00:08:33.541 --> 00:08:35.209
Listen here, kid!

00:08:35.242 --> 00:08:37.711
Tell me what candy
you're talking about!

00:08:37.745 --> 00:08:39.914
I can explain,
Mr. Pekoms! Actually--

00:08:39.947 --> 00:08:41.382
Hey, I don't know you.

00:08:41.415 --> 00:08:42.783
You're not a Fishman.

00:08:42.816 --> 00:08:44.685
Are you here for sweets, too?

00:08:44.718 --> 00:08:46.120
I'm right there with you, buddy,

00:08:46.153 --> 00:08:48.155
I can't get enough
of 'em either!

00:08:48.188 --> 00:08:49.356
You what?!

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.158
All right, that's it.

00:08:51.191 --> 00:08:55.296
Did that brat just say
what I think he said? Huh?!

00:08:55.329 --> 00:08:58.599
Well, uh... I assure you
there's an explanation.

00:08:58.632 --> 00:09:01.402
Awesome! I've never
seen a talking lion!

00:09:01.435 --> 00:09:04.738
Eh, it's no big deal. We have
a fluffy animal guy, too.

00:09:04.772 --> 00:09:06.073
Achoo!

00:09:06.106 --> 00:09:08.075
Gesundheit! Are you sick?

00:09:08.108 --> 00:09:10.878
Ugh, no. Guess someone's
talking about me.

00:09:10.911 --> 00:09:12.079
That's just silly.

00:09:17.184 --> 00:09:21.188
Huh. Sorry, but it's kinda
hard to take you seriously.

00:09:21.221 --> 00:09:22.790
What'd you say, pal?

00:09:22.823 --> 00:09:26.360
I'll make you regret that! Grrr!

00:09:26.393 --> 00:09:28.662
[chuckles, laughs]

00:09:28.696 --> 00:09:31.131
Don't laugh at me! You little--

00:09:31.165 --> 00:09:32.166
[TAMAGO]
Pekoms.

00:09:32.199 --> 00:09:33.200
Uh--

00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:36.503
[TAMAGO] Threatening this
monsieur will not bring us

00:09:36.537 --> 00:09:39.807
any closer to the
sweets, mon frère.

00:09:44.211 --> 00:09:46.981
[TAMAGO] The tea party
is in four days.

00:09:47.014 --> 00:09:49.717
Let us try to avoid a faux pas.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.921
If we have to wait here until
morning, well, c'est la vie!

00:09:53.954 --> 00:09:55.889
[LUFFY]
You're just as weird as he is!

00:09:55.923 --> 00:09:57.257
What's your name?

00:09:59.493 --> 00:10:03.664
[TAMAGO] Bonjour et enchante,
mes amies pirates!

00:10:03.697 --> 00:10:05.199
Je suis Baron Tamago.

00:10:05.232 --> 00:10:07.901
I am pleased to make
your acquaintance!

00:10:07.935 --> 00:10:09.570
Uh, Tamago?

00:10:09.603 --> 00:10:11.839
[TAMAGO chuckles]

00:10:11.872 --> 00:10:12.673
Huh?

00:10:12.706 --> 00:10:13.741
[TAMAGO]
Oui!

00:10:13.774 --> 00:10:17.044
Take care to remember
my name, s'il vous plait.

00:10:18.245 --> 00:10:20.648
[sighs]

00:10:20.681 --> 00:10:24.284
Now, excusez-moi, monsieurs.

00:10:24.318 --> 00:10:25.219
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:10:25.252 --> 00:10:27.021
Am I to comprend that
you have devoured

00:10:27.054 --> 00:10:30.891
all the sweets in the factory,
my little bon vivant?

00:10:30.924 --> 00:10:31.925
Did you get that?

00:10:31.959 --> 00:10:33.527
Yup, that was me.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.296
I could go for some
more right about now!

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.933
Unfortunately, the candies
have met their denouement.

00:10:43.003 --> 00:10:44.138
[TAMAGO]
Attents!

00:10:44.171 --> 00:10:47.675
That is the Jolly Roger of
our boss, Charlotte Linlin,

00:10:47.708 --> 00:10:50.944
also known as Big Mom
of the Four Emperors.

00:10:50.978 --> 00:10:53.313
That symbol indicates
that this island

00:10:53.347 --> 00:10:56.417
is Mama's territory, d'accord?

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.453
You see, Mama owns the place,

00:10:59.486 --> 00:11:02.790
which means Fishman Island
is under Big Mom's protection!

00:11:02.823 --> 00:11:04.792
That's a nice thing to do!

00:11:04.825 --> 00:11:06.794
I like your boss already!

00:11:06.827 --> 00:11:08.662
Kind'a weird name, though.

00:11:08.696 --> 00:11:12.766
Au contraire, mon amie.
This is a business deal.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.701
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:11:13.734 --> 00:11:16.537
We allow them the
protection of our mark.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.539
And in exchange,
they have to pay Mama

00:11:18.572 --> 00:11:21.308
ten tons of sweets every month.

00:11:21.341 --> 00:11:22.409
That's a lot!

00:11:22.443 --> 00:11:23.911
[TAMAGO]
Oui, monsieur.

00:11:23.944 --> 00:11:28.849
There is nothing in this world
Mama loves more than sweets.

00:11:28.882 --> 00:11:30.617
Mama says sweets
from Fishman Island

00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:33.821
are the crème de la
crème, you know. Ha!

00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:36.924
Pay up tomorrow
and we will bid you adieu.

00:11:36.957 --> 00:11:39.660
I-I'm sorry, sir,
but I told you before.

00:11:39.693 --> 00:11:42.896
The machinery used to make
the candy was badly damaged.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.966
It'll take us at least two
weeks to make the repairs!

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:47.634
We won't be ready tomorrow.

00:11:47.668 --> 00:11:49.837
That is not our
probléme, monsieur.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.138
Hey, Fancy!

00:11:51.171 --> 00:11:53.173
Why can't you just wait a while?

00:11:53.207 --> 00:11:54.942
Yeah, and why doesn't
your boss have the balls

00:11:54.975 --> 00:11:56.710
to come talk to us himself?

00:11:56.744 --> 00:11:58.712
He's one of the
Four Emperors, isn't he?

00:11:58.746 --> 00:12:00.414
Where are your manners?

00:12:00.447 --> 00:12:02.683
Our leader happens
to be a madam pirate,

00:12:02.716 --> 00:12:04.184
and a fearsome one at that!

00:12:04.218 --> 00:12:07.154
That said, I do not think
Mama has "the balls."

00:12:07.187 --> 00:12:10.691
It's a girl?
That's different, then.

00:12:10.724 --> 00:12:11.892
I love sweets.

00:12:11.925 --> 00:12:13.994
I just can't resist the things!

00:12:14.027 --> 00:12:16.764
And I really love men
who can make them.

00:12:18.265 --> 00:12:23.337
Uh-- Anyway, what if your boss
lady doesn't get her candy?

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.572
[TAMAGO]
In that case...

00:12:27.775 --> 00:12:30.878
[TAMAGO]
Voila! The deal is off!

00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:33.914
The Big Mom Pirates
will attack en masse,

00:12:33.947 --> 00:12:39.820
and you can say so long and bon
soir to this island miserable!

00:12:39.853 --> 00:12:41.822
You wanna destroy the island?

00:12:41.855 --> 00:12:43.624
How crazy can you be?

00:12:43.657 --> 00:12:46.160
You can't do that over
some stupid candies!

00:12:46.193 --> 00:12:49.730
I won't let you! We just
saved this place, you know!

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.485
[BIG MOM laughing]

00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:17.825
[BIG MOM PIRATE A]
You seem so happy, Mama.

00:13:17.858 --> 00:13:22.396
[BIG MOM] Yes, it's only
four days until the tea party.

00:13:22.429 --> 00:13:25.065
I can hardly wait!

00:13:27.935 --> 00:13:31.471
I'll finally be able to taste
those delectable candies

00:13:31.505 --> 00:13:33.140
from Fishman Island!

00:13:33.173 --> 00:13:35.375
I'm so excited,
my stomach is already

00:13:35.409 --> 00:13:38.378
producing all the
acid I'll need!

00:13:38.412 --> 00:13:40.080
[BIG MOM PIRATES]
Candy! Candy!

00:13:40.113 --> 00:13:41.782
Fishman Island Candy!

00:13:41.815 --> 00:13:44.284
[BIG MOM]
I see you are all excited, too.

00:13:44.318 --> 00:13:45.752
[BIG MOM PIRATES]
Of course, Mama!

00:13:45.786 --> 00:13:47.855
That's the best candy there is!

00:13:47.888 --> 00:13:50.290
Then wait for them
in my stomach,

00:13:50.324 --> 00:13:52.926
because that's where
they're all going to go!

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.394

Mama! I'm home now!

00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:30.964
[BIG MOM] Oh, Bobbin.
How did your mission go?

00:14:30.998 --> 00:14:32.733
I set the whole place on fire!

00:14:32.766 --> 00:14:35.569
That's wonderful to hear!

00:14:35.602 --> 00:14:38.939
That country's baked goods
were the best in the world.

00:14:38.972 --> 00:14:43.610
I bet it smelled so
delicious as it burned.

00:14:43.644 --> 00:14:46.847
It's a shame we had to do it,

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.750
but they should've
honored our agreement.

00:14:51.418 --> 00:14:53.253
Can I have a snack?

00:14:53.287 --> 00:14:54.955
[BIG MOM]
If they can't pay in sweets,

00:14:54.988 --> 00:14:56.523
they pay with their lives.

[BIG MOM] If there's
one thing I can't stand,

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.695
it's a broken promise.

00:15:01.728 --> 00:15:05.332
That, and bitter
candy, of course.

00:15:05.365 --> 00:15:06.667
Oh, that reminds me!

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.803
Apparently, Fishman Island can't
send their payment right now.

00:15:09.836 --> 00:15:12.039
[BIG MOM]
Hmm?!

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.609
[BOBBIN] Pekoms just
told me all about it.

00:15:15.642 --> 00:15:17.577
Should I burn that down, too?

I have a bad feeling, Nami.

00:22:01.314 --> 00:22:02.549
What if they're hurt?

00:22:02.582 --> 00:22:05.752
You're right, it is
taking them a long time.

00:22:05.785 --> 00:22:08.788
What did those goofballs
get themselves into now?

00:22:08.822 --> 00:22:13.226
If they come back without that
treasure, it will not be pretty.

00:22:13.259 --> 00:22:16.529
[BIG MOM]
Well then, Monkey D. Luffy.

00:22:16.563 --> 00:22:19.566
Now that I know who you are,

00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:21.101
come here.

00:22:21.134 --> 00:22:22.836
Let's chat in the New World!

00:22:22.869 --> 00:22:24.871
[CROWD gasps]

00:22:27.173 --> 00:22:29.676
She means to kill him!

00:22:32.812 --> 00:22:35.482
Sure thing. Be there soon.

00:22:35.515 --> 00:22:38.318
I've got something I need
to settle with you, too.

00:22:38.351 --> 00:22:39.753
[BIG MOM]
Hm?

00:22:41.521 --> 00:22:43.089
I like this island.

00:22:43.123 --> 00:22:45.558
It's too risky to
trust you with it!

00:22:48.695 --> 00:22:50.563
Once I get there,

00:22:50.597 --> 00:22:52.699
I'm gonna kick your ass.

00:22:58.138 --> 00:23:01.241
And then I'll make
Fishman Island my territory!

00:23:01.274 --> 00:23:06.413
[BIG MOM growling]

00:23:06.446 --> 00:23:08.548
[BIG MOM]
Little brat!

00:23:10.984 --> 00:23:13.486
[NARRATOR] The crisis of Fishman
Island is averted for now,

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.789
but a secret hidden inside
their royal treasure,

00:23:15.822 --> 00:23:16.990
the Tamate Box,

00:23:17.023 --> 00:23:18.558
may cause trouble with Big Mom

00:23:18.591 --> 00:23:20.193
when Luffy reaches
the New World.

00:23:20.226 --> 00:23:22.262
However, she is but
one of many foes

00:23:22.295 --> 00:23:24.164
that the Straw Hats
have to worry about.

00:23:24.197 --> 00:23:26.800
An old adversary has
made a move to new waters

00:23:26.833 --> 00:23:28.101
and it's only a matter of time

00:23:28.134 --> 00:23:29.969
until they're forced
to face off again.

00:23:30.003 --> 00:23:31.638
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.671 --> 00:23:33.606
"Many Problems Lie Ahead!

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.742
A Trap Awaiting
in the New World!"

00:23:35.775 --> 00:23:38.344
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
