351
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,834
weakness is nothing
short of a crime.

352
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:48,736
They surrendered to
the enemy and brought chaos

353
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:51,038
to the very kingdom
that they serve.

354
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,208
A cowardly soldier
doesn't deserve to live.

355
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,076
So, I killed them.

Yes. Because justice
never submits to evil.

have to cook up a new plan.

[DOBERMAN] That boy,
