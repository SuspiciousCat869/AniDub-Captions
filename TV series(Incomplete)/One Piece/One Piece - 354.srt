1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,032
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,468
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,502 --> 00:02:45,139
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:50,178
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:54,082
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:57,452
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,485 --> 00:02:59,888
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:03,324
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:06,294
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:09,564
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,176
[ROBIN] It's hard to look at.

48
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,548
[SANJI] He... He's going...
to marry her?

49
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,218
No way in hell! Lemme at him!

50
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,920
Wow, this guy
must be pretty brave

51
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:33,421
if he wants to marry Nami!

52
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:35,657
And what's this about
me being a monster?

53
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,226
Why does my shadow get
to do all the cool stuff?

54
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,296
So if we find this guy with the
clogs, the dog penguin thing,

55
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,130
the one that has Sanji's shadow,

56
00:03:42,163 --> 00:03:44,399
and Luffy's
giant monster zombie,

57
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,467
all we gotta do is throw
some salt in their mouths

58
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:48,236
and then we'll get
our shadows back?

59
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,170
Is that it?

60
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:51,272
Nice job on figuring
out their weakness--

61
00:03:51,306 --> 00:03:52,340
how'd you pull that one?

62
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:54,509
[FRANKY] Save your thanks
for the afro skeleton.

63
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,377
Not only did he know
how to beat the zombies,

64
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:59,147
he also told us you'd be
waiting back here at the Sunny.

65
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,485
I was wrong.
That skeleton's a real man.

66
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,956
After all, you said before
that you were so lonely,

67
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,158
you wanted to die, right?

68
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:12,093
If I were you,
I would've given up

69
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,195
on life a long time ago.

70
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:16,364
What is it that's
keeping you alive?

71
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:18,333
You said you made
a promise to a friend?

72
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:21,502
What is it? How could
it be so important?

73
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,372
[BROOK]
The story is quite simple.

74
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:27,275
At a certain point in the past,
before we came to these waters,

75
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,278
my crew left behind
a good friend of ours.

76
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,514
It was a troubling situation,
but we did it out of necessity.

77
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:35,984
The only consolation we
could offer this friend was

78
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:38,953
a promise that we would return
one day, no matter the cost.

79
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,356
But then the crew
was annihilated.

80
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:45,326
And the promise that we
made was left unfulfilled.

81
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,463
How long has it been
since the day we died?

82
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:52,066
I've lost count, but it's
been more than 50 years now.

83
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:54,102
50 years?

84
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:55,603
You're talking ages ago, here!

85
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:58,039
Hell, I wasn't even born yet!

86
00:04:58,072 --> 00:04:59,173
I hate to break
it to you buddy,

87
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:02,710
but there's no way your
friend's still waiting for you.

88
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:04,145
[BROOK] But, it's true that
he would have every right

89
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,713
to leave by now.

90
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:10,184
I realize I may be foolish to
believe that he's still there.

91
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:12,286
[BROOK] The name of that
friend that we left at the cape,

92
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,622
swearing to meet again, is...

93
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:16,758
...Laboon.

94
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,359
Even if I am able to return,

95
00:05:18,393 --> 00:05:20,261
I don't think he'll
forgive us for running away

96
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:22,263
and dying like that.

97
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:24,065
But no matter how
much he resents me

98
00:05:24,098 --> 00:05:26,501
for forcing him to suffer
all of these years.

99
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,407
[BROOK]
Death is never an apology.

100
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:35,009
Because when a
man makes a promise,

101
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,979
he doesn't stop fighting
until he fulfills it!

102
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:44,385
[FRANKY] So there you have it,
that's it, the whole story.

103
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,054
Laboon.

104
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:53,594
This is crazy,
what're the chances?

105
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:55,763
I'll be damned.

106
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,768
Hm? Hm?

107
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:08,209
Oh, right. Chopper and
Robin weren't with us then.

108
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,679
We've met that whale before.

109
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:16,684
And we know, that promise.

110
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:23,124
[whale roar]

111
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,727
[LUFFY]
"I Swear to Go See Him!

112
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,463
Brook and the Cape of Promise."

113
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:33,501
Hold on, you know him?

114
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:37,238
That's crazy.
How is that possible?

115
00:06:38,473 --> 00:06:39,741
[SANJI] It was when
we passed through

116
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,443
to the Grand Line
at the two capes.

117
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,380
That damn giant whale
was blocking the entrance.

118
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:51,385
[SANJI] Nami! I see
a mountain up ahead!

119
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,488
What? That's impossible!

120
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:55,556
[SANJI] But, it's right there!
I can see it!

121
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,825
Who cares? Go!

122
00:06:57,859 --> 00:07:03,131
[roaring sound]

123
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,568
[CREW screams]

124
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:09,137
[SANJI] Oh crap!

125
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,571
It's not a mountain!

126
00:07:10,605 --> 00:07:11,806
[LUFFY] It's a black wall!

127
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,107
[NAMI] No, it's not!

128
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,509
[ZORO] Then, what is it?

129
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:17,378
[USOPP] It's a whale!

130
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:20,515
[roars]

131
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:22,216
[USOPP] What're we gonna do?

132
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:22,850
[LUFFY] Should we fight?

133
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:23,918
[NAMI] Idiot!

134
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:25,887
How are we supposed to
fight a hundred-ton whale?

135
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,822
[USOPP] B-But, we
h-have to do something!

136
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:29,390
Our path is blocked!
How do we escape?

137
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:31,192
Wait! I know!

138
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:32,727
This'll work! It has to!

139
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:34,462
[NAMI] Hey!

140
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,696
Luffy! What're you doing?

141
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:44,172
[USOPP] This is pointless!

142
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:46,240
The ship's not gonna turn!

143
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,275
[ZORO] Dammit!

144
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:48,876
[SANJI] Don't give up!

145
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,453
[NAMI] Is this the end?

146
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:08,429
[CREW] The cannon?

147
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:10,565
[LUFFY chuckles] Done!

148
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:21,375
We're screwed.

149
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:23,411
This is it.

150
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:25,246
Aaaaaaah!!

151
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,481
Hey, that was
my special seat!

152
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:28,716
[ZORO] Let's get out of
here before it's too late!

153
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:30,952
[USOPP] Someone mind telling
me what the heck is going on?

154
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:32,353
[SANJI] It's so big
that the cannon ball

155
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,521
didn't even make it flinch!

156
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,389
That or his reaction
time is really slow!

157
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:36,624
[ZORO] Who cares?
At least we're alive!

158
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:41,762
[roars]

159
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:44,265
Aaaaaugh!! My ears!

160
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:45,633
[USOPP] Paddle! Just paddle!

161
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,635
[ZORO] We have to
get away from here!

162
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,609
[NAMI] Luffy?

163
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:56,644
[LUFFY] You think you
can break my special seat

164
00:08:56,677 --> 00:08:58,379
and get away with it?

165
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,948
Take this!

166
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:04,886
[CREW] You moron!

167
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:14,395
[CREW screams]

168
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,601
Please! No!

169
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:37,385
[NAMI] Luffy!

170
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:38,686
[SANJI] Luffy!

171
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,462
[LUFFY] I'm not gonna die!

172
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,793
[SANJI] Thanks to
Luffy's idiotic temper.

173
00:10:02,827 --> 00:10:05,596
Laboon swallowed the
ship with us aboard.

174
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,633
What? The whale
ate you guys?

175
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,168
And this is the
same Laboon as Brook's?

176
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:12,403
[SANJI] Has to be.

177
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:14,305
There was an old lighthouse
keeper that lived inside his gut

178
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:16,073
and told us all about the whale.

179
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:17,642
What?

180
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,178
That flower head guy.

181
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:31,789
[SANJI] Not only did
he go inside him.

182
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:34,759
He took care of him
and treated his wounds.

183
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:39,130
What's a lighthouse guy
know about wounds?

184
00:10:39,163 --> 00:10:41,132
[USOPP] Plenty if they've
got medical experience.

185
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:44,201
He was apparently the doctor
for a pirate crew at one time.

186
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:46,303
Wow. But how'd
the whale get so hurt

187
00:10:46,337 --> 00:10:48,406
that he needed a
doctor to treat him?

188
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,840
What happened?

189
00:10:49,874 --> 00:10:51,709
It was at the Red Line.

190
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:52,643
Grief drove him to keep

191
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:55,279
bashing his head against
the dividing wall.

192
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:57,114
The grief of abandonment.

193
00:10:57,148 --> 00:10:59,650
He'd spent fifty years
waiting for his friends there,

194
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:02,353
believing they'd return
for him after their voyage.

195
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:07,291
[USOPP] Don't you think
fifty years is a bit extreme?

196
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:09,794
Those pirates sure know how
to test someone's patience!

197
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:11,228
[SANJI] Idiot! Don't ya get it?

198
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:13,097
This is the Grand Line.

199
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,332
His friends are dead.

200
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,403
[SANJI] That whale can wait
forever, they won't be back.

201
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:21,672
[NAMI] Sad to say,
but that's probably true.

202
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:23,441
Back in the day when those
guys traveled the Grand Line

203
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,542
it was an uncharted sea,

204
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:27,078
a thousand times more
treacherous than it is now.

205
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:29,080
[USOPP] Why are you
all being so pessimistic?

206
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:30,314
You don't know if they're dead!

207
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:32,216
They could still
come back for him!

208
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:34,385
C'mon, have some
sympathy will ya?

209
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:35,920
I thought it was
very touching.

210
00:11:35,953 --> 00:11:37,455
I mean, a whale still
believing in a promise

211
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,457
his friends made
despite all these years?

212
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,759
That's a true bond!
Right, pops?

213
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:42,760
[CROCUS] Indeed.

214
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:45,930
But the lesson here is
that reality is cruel.

215
00:11:45,963 --> 00:11:48,232
Laboon's cohorts aren't dead.

216
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:50,901
The truth is, they
abandoned their quest.

217
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:54,205
I learned from that they turned
tail and left the Grand Line.

218
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:55,439
[USOPP] I don't believe it.

219
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:58,843
I mean, why abandon
him like that?

220
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:02,880
[CROCUS] I can't claim to know
exactly what became of them.

221
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:05,716
But I doubt they'll
ever come back here again.

222
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,419
Seasons, weather,
currents, wind direction.

223
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:10,387
On the Grand Line,
these elements seem

224
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:13,157
to defy the very laws of nature.

225
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,892
Common sense is useless.

226
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:19,096
And the terror of that fact
can be quite overwhelming.

227
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,134
Why would anybody
abandon such a loyal creature?

228
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,971
Just look at him!
It's cruelty on a grand scale!

229
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:28,105
But if you've known all this,

230
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,073
why haven't you told him?

231
00:12:29,106 --> 00:12:31,475
Laboon can obviously
communicate with you.

232
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:34,311
He seems to understand
humans quite well for a whale.

233
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:35,479
[CROCUS] I did tell him.

234
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:38,382
Down to the last,
miserable detail.

235
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:48,859
[roars]

236
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:01,172
Laboon! Please! I say
this for your own good!

237
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:03,407
They're not coming back!

238
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:15,319
I understand that you
don't wanna accept it,

239
00:13:15,352 --> 00:13:18,823
but you need to realize
this is how things are.

240
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:20,958
Listen!

241
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:26,463
Laboon!

242
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,209
[CROCUS] That was
the day that Laboon

243
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:40,878
began to howl at
Reverse Mountain.

244
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:45,182
Soon after, he started slamming
his body against the Red Line.

245
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:48,586
It's as if he believes that wall
is what keeps his friends away,

246
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:53,157
and by breaking it, he can
clear the path for their return.

247
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,025
[SANJI] I admire his dedication.

248
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:56,460
[USOPP] He never gave up on 'em.

249
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:58,229
[CROCUS] He refuses
to believe me

250
00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:00,931
because then he'd have
to admit that it's over.

251
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,834
And that terrifies
him more than anything.

252
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:06,403
There's no way for him to
go back to the West Blue.

253
00:14:06,437 --> 00:14:10,107
So, what we have here is a
paradox of tragic proportions.

254
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,878
Laboon is a lost soul dying
to live with his friends,

255
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:16,881
but won't stop killing
himself to reach them.

256
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:33,898
[CROCUS] The scars
on his hide are deep.

257
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:36,066
Those in his heart
are even deeper.

258
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,570
He needs someone to tend his
wounds and I'm all he's got.

259
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:41,272
For years,
he's battered himself

260
00:14:41,305 --> 00:14:42,873
while I've patched him up.

261
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:45,342
A strange friendship,
but it works.

262
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,947
What the hell is
that idiot up to?

263
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,348
Ya gotta watch
him every second.

264
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:53,984
[SANJI] We've been watching
him, look what happens.

265
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,420
Gum-Gum...

266
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:59,390
...Flower Arrangement!

267
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,926
Ya think he's aware
that that's our mast?

268
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:03,894
And now it's on top of a whale.

269
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:05,529
Why'd he do that?

270
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:08,165
Hey, Luffy, stop
tearing up the ship!

271
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:14,571
[wails]

272
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:17,408
You ass! Luffy, stop!

273
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:29,219
The boy! He's dead!

274
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:30,187
Oh, don't worry!

275
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,556
It'll take way more
than that to kill Luffy!

276
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,295
Ha! Gotcha!

277
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,637
What's does he
think he's doing?

278
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,342
[ZORO] You wanna let us in

279
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,544
on your plan before
you kill yourself?

280
00:15:58,115 --> 00:15:59,650
[LUFFY] It's a draw!

281
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:06,690
I'm stronger than I look!

282
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:09,259
But, I have a
feeling you knew that.

283
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:11,662
I can always tell when
someone's itching to fight.

284
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:15,099
Well, if you want a battle,
I'll gladly give ya one.

285
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:17,267
Your shipmates used to
spar with you didn't they?

286
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:21,572
You miss it. Well, I can rival
anything they threw at ya!

287
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,573
Tell ya what.

288
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,608
After me and my friends
travel the Grand Line,

289
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:26,377
we'll come back and find you.

290
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,313
And then you better
be ready for a rematch!

291
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:45,596
[LUFFY] Hey, not bad!

292
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,364
Consider this a
symbol of my promise

293
00:16:47,398 --> 00:16:49,400
to come do battle with you!

294
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:50,601
Of course, it's
a rush paint job,

295
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,337
so you'll have to be careful
and avoid hitting your head

296
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,472
or you'll rub it
right off. Understand?

297
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,577
[LUFFY] Good whale!

298
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,680
[LUFFY] See ya, pops!

299
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:06,517
Thanks again for the
Log Pose! Take care!

300
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,152
[CROCUS] Have a
safe trip, my boy!

301
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:09,353
[LUFFY] I'm off, Laboon!

302
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:11,588
Be ready to fight
when I get back!

303
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,628
[LUFFY] Next stop, Whisky Peak!

304
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:23,500
Ready gang? Let's set sail!

305
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:44,655
I couldn't believe it,
but somehow,

306
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,090
Luffy convinced
him to stop trying

307
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:48,792
to break through the
wall like a damned idiot.

308
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:51,528
Even now, he's alive out there.

309
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:58,435
Waiting at that cape for
his friends to finally return.

310
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,437
[USOPP] It's an
incredible story.

311
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,239
Talk about true friends.

312
00:18:02,272 --> 00:18:05,609
He kept his promise to them
for more than half a century.

313
00:18:05,642 --> 00:18:06,977
And to think,

314
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,547
we met one of Laboon's friends
by complete coincidence.

315
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:19,923
[ZORO] Wonder what that
skeleton's doing right now.

316
00:18:26,497 --> 00:18:27,798
[RYUMA]
Nyohohoho!

317
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:29,800
I won't deny that
you've gotten stronger

318
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,669
over these past
five years, but so have I!

319
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:35,639
And remember,

320
00:18:35,672 --> 00:18:38,408
I already know every
move you're gonna make!

321
00:18:51,155 --> 00:18:55,893
[RYUMA]
Nyohohoho.

322
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,861
You care more about
that damn afro

323
00:18:57,895 --> 00:18:59,897
than the skull beneath it.

324
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,797
Too bad for that it's

325
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:03,734
the biggest target
on your whole body.

326
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,502
[BROOK] Shut up!

327
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:15,078
[BROOK thinking]
Laboon, I wonder, old friend,

328
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,682
after all these years,
do you still remember me?

329
00:19:22,686 --> 00:19:25,722
[BROOK thinking] When I think of
how alone you must have felt.

330
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:28,392
It breaks my heart in two.

331
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:32,529
[BROOK thinking]
Although, I don't suppose

332
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:34,131
I have a heart anymore.

333
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:38,168
[BROOK thinking]
The Grand Line is so fearsome.

334
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:41,838
Believe me. I tried
as hard as I could.

335
00:19:41,872 --> 00:19:43,707
I tried to bring
them back to you,

336
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,877
but all of our friends
have passed away.

337
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:56,553
[BROOK thinking] Not only
have I lost our friends,

338
00:19:56,587 --> 00:19:59,122
I've lost my face,
my body, my shadow.

339
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,491
Everything I once was.

340
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:02,859
If we were to meet again.

341
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:05,562
You probably wouldn't
even recognize me.

342
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:08,065
How could you, with
me looking like this?

343
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:12,035
Nyohoho!

344
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,992
Keep away from the afro!

345
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,634
Nyohohoho!

346
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,740
[BROOK thinking]
I don't have anything left.

347
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:52,476
Not a single reminder
of my old self.

348
00:20:53,744 --> 00:20:55,912
[BROOK thinking] Except
for this hair on my head.

349
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:59,983
Black, round,
and funny, just like you.

350
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,128
[RUMBAR PIRATE 354A]
I didn't notice it before,

351
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:12,829
but they kinda look alike.

352
00:21:12,863 --> 00:21:15,832
Brook's head is almost
the same shape as Laboon's.

353
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:19,202
[RUMBAR PIRATE 354B] The two
of you could be brothers!

354
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:23,273
[BROOK thinking]
I must protect it,

355
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:25,709
so you'll still recognize me!

356
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:32,182
[BROOK thinking] I'm coming,
Laboon! Just as I promised!

357
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,754
[BROOK thinking] I hope
you're still waiting.

358
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,692
[BROOK thinking] Waiting for me.

359
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:46,596
[BROOK thinking]
At our promised cape.

360
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:59,743
[FRANKY bawls]

361
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:03,013
I love that bonehead
and his stupid whale!

362
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:04,881
Shut up!

363
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,653
I'm so pumped, guys!
He's a musician,

364
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:14,791
a talking skeleton, has an afro,
does that "yoho" thing,

365
00:22:14,825 --> 00:22:18,595
and he was one of
Laboon's best friends!

366
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,230
[LUFFY] Even if I've
gotta force him to,

367
00:22:20,263 --> 00:22:22,265
he's gonna join our crew.

368
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,636
We got us a musician.
Any objections? Speak up.

369
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:30,073
Haha. Would it really change
your mind even if we did?

370
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:31,708
I want him to
join the crew too!

371
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:33,677
No question! Him and Laboon!

372
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,846
Complete and total approval!

373
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:37,881
Same here,
you big dumb bastard!

374
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:40,350
And I'm not scared
of skeletons, dammit!

375
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,186
Before I can answer
such an easy question.

376
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,057
I've gotta put a stop to this
shotgun wedding of Nami's!

377
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:50,694
[LUFFY] Hey, Zoro!
Where ya goin'?

378
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:54,030
I'm going off to get started.

379
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:54,831
Ya keep adding shadows.

380
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:57,834
We got a lot we
need to get back.

381
00:22:57,868 --> 00:22:59,369
[chuckles]

382
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:02,406
[LUFFY] Alright, crew!
Time to get serious!

383
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:04,641
Prepare for the counterattack!

384
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,677
We're gonna put Thriller Bark
in a watery grave!

385
00:23:07,711 --> 00:23:09,946
[CREW] Yeah!

386
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:12,315
Have fun!

387
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,050
You're with us, moron!

388
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,624
[SANJI] Unforgivable!

389
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:22,726
This creep thinks
he can marry Nami?

390
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,361
[USOPP] He fell head
over heels in love.

391
00:23:24,394 --> 00:23:26,329
It all happened when
she was taking a bath.

392
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,766
[SANJI] A bath?
You mean he peeped on her?

393
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,234
[USOPP] He touched her, too.

394
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:34,438
[SANJI] Arrrrrrrgh!!!
He's a dead man!

395
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:36,006
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

396
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,941
"Food, Nami and Shadows!

397
00:23:37,974 --> 00:23:40,177
Luffy's Enraged Counterattack!"

398
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,379
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
