1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,408
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:41,044
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,347
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,283
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:48,117
Monkey D. Luffy,

42
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:50,053
a boy whose
body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,654
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:54,591
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:57,460
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

46
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:59,128
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:00,630
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:03,967
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:07,570
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,974
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:14,043
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:18,581
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

53
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:25,355
[NARRATOR] Luffy was sent flying
from the Sabaody Archipelago

54
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:27,590
by Bartholomew Kuma.

55
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,492
After soaring
through the sky for hours,

56
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:32,996
he found himself in a kingdom
inhabited entirely by women,

57
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:35,632
Amazon Lily.

58
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:36,633
What's the matter?

59
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,501
I heard a loud crash!

60
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:40,270
Are you okay? What happened?

61
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,771
Shroud yourself
from his leering gaze.

62
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,506
Huh? No...

63
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:46,509
My secret is out.
He saw my back.

64
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:47,710
[NARRATOR]
After seeing the back

65
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:50,179
of the Pirate
Empress Boa Hancock,

66
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:52,215
Luffy was caught
by the Kuja Pirates

67
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:54,784
and taken to a fighting arena.

68
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,586
Love-Love Beam!

69
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:01,691
[LUFFY] Hey...

70
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:03,059
Hey, you!

71
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:04,661
What the hell did you do?

72
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:06,596
These three
saved my life, you know!

73
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,732
This is the female
warrior nation of Amazon Lily.

74
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:12,535
Here, strength is
regarded as true beauty.

75
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:15,338
Show us what little
strength you may possess

76
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:18,107
and be grateful that
I've given you death in battle.

77
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:39,329
What the hell is
wrong with all of you?

78
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,498
[LUFFY] That woman up there...

79
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:46,703
She turned three of
your own people into stone!

80
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:49,305
How can you just sit up
there and laugh like that?

81
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:50,540
[AMAZON] I never!

82
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:53,643
That little savage has
the gall to shout at us!

83
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:56,346
Don't listen to him!
He's just an animal!

84
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:06,089
[AMAZONS chattering angrily]

85
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:07,523
What you don't understand...

86
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,226
...is that I'll be
forgiven for anything I do.

87
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,862
Absolutely anything.

88
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,364
And the reason why...

89
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,367
...is because I'm beautiful.

90
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,402
Actually, you make me sick.

91
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:30,546
So these girls have powers, too.

92
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:36,652
[LUFFY]
A Difficult Fight for Luffy!

93
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:39,322
The Snake Sisters' Haki Power!

94
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:49,232
[AMAZONS] Execution! Execution!
Execution! Execution!

95
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:54,270
[chanting continues]

96
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,627
The sisters are about to
start their Snake Pit Dance!

97
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,368
[AMAZON 412B]
I've never seen Marigold's

98
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,903
Salamander move before!

99
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:28,504
I can't wait!

100
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,541
[AMAZON 413B]
Ooh. Don't forget about

101
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:34,243
Sandersonia's
Eight-Headed Serpent!

102
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:49,592
[AMAZONS cheering]

103
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,195
[AMAZON 413C] They look
fabulous when they transform!

104
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:53,129
[AMAZON 413D] Of course they do!

105
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,264
It's proof that
they've slain the Gorgon!

106
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,799
They've got
great looks and power.

107
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,634
It must run in the family!

108
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:11,781
What's a Gorgon?

109
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:14,317
Is there something
I'm missing here?

110
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,353
Just looks like they've
eaten Devil Fruits to me.

111
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:19,755
[MARIGOLD and
SANDERSONIA laughing]

112
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,657
That man sure is finished now!

113
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,259
I can't stand waiting!

114
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:24,560
Just put him to death!

115
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:30,333
[AMAZONS]
Execution! Execution! Execution!

116
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,502
Perhaps I'll just
swallow him whole.

117
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,238
Or maybe squeeze him to bits.

118
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:38,274
[AMAZON 413E]
Look at him! He's scared stiff!

119
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:40,476
[AMAZON 413F]
Just stand there and die, then!

120
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,580
Wait! Time out!

121
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:47,283
What now? Want to beg?

122
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:49,819
Grovel all you like,
but we'll still destroy you.

123
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:51,754
No, it's not like that.

124
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,524
[AMAZON 413G] What's he doing?

125
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:57,994
Look!

126
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,835
[LUFFY] There.
You're not cracked, are you?

127
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:45,508
Good. Just wait here, okay?

128
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,844
Real sorry you got turned
into stone 'cause of me.

129
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:49,712
If Chopper were here,

130
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:52,949
maybe he could
figure something out.

131
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:55,451
Hopefully you'll go back
to normal again somehow,

132
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:58,788
like after Aokiji
turned me and Robin into ice!

133
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,756
That's a kind gesture.

134
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,392
But you should be more
concerned about yourself.

135
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:05,728
Shut up!
I'll do what I want!

136
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:07,563
Is he trying to...?

137
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,932
He's saving Margaret
and the others from harm!

138
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:10,833
But why?

139
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:13,302
He's already been
sentenced to death!

140
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:17,473
[LUFFY] All done.

141
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:21,227
Okay. Which one of you
wants your ass kicked first?

142
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,034
What a joke!

143
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:50,039
[AMAZONS laughing]

144
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:52,108
Did he just say
what I think he said?

145
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:55,077
If he thinks he can win,
he's in for an ugly surprise!

146
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,145
Hilarious!

147
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,247
Let's find more men to
feed to the Gorgon Sisters

148
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:00,216
because this is too funny!

149
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:07,123
Are we still fighting?
'Cause I'm ready.

150
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,125
Sure. Why not?

151
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,126
Now then...

152
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,228
Since you seem intent
on winning this battle,

153
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:14,030
let me give you
a little warning:

154
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:16,666
I wouldn't fall into that pit
between the ring and the seats

155
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,267
if I were you.

156
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:22,471
[MARIGOLD] Well, you could,
if you wanted to be impaled

157
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:24,607
on razor-sharp blades.

158
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,045
All right,
shall we begin, man?

159
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,147
[LUFFY] Yep! Ready when you are!

160
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,181
[MARIGOLD] Good.

161
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:36,085
Don't blink.
This won't take long.

162
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:38,187
[HANCOCK]
Marigold! And Sandersonia!

163
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,455
Execute him, now!

164
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:41,624
For the crime of
sneaking onto our island

165
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:43,926
and for personally offending me,

166
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,262
bestow on him the
ultimate punishment!

167
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:48,531
[AMAZONS cheering]

168
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,232
Let him have it!

169
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:52,368
Yeah!

170
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:06,082
[MARIGOLD] Careful now!

171
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,125
[MARIGOLD] He may
have some skill after all.

172
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:17,293
Show him who's boss!

173
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:19,395
That's the way, Marigold!

174
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:26,202
[LUFFY] Crap!

175
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:31,006
Poison, huh? That was close!

176
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,509
Powerful Poison!

177
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:56,365
[LUFFY] Now Gum-Gum...

178
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,033
...Stamp!

179
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:07,743
That hurt me.

180
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:10,079
But how? I'm... made of rubber!

181
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,415
Told ya!
He's all bark and no bite!

182
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:15,017
But can all men stretch out
and whip around like that?

183
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,352
How fun!

184
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:23,025
Damn! What's wrong?
Am I... not rubber anymore?

185
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:24,326
No, that's not it.

186
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,163
Then why did it hurt
when she hit me?

187
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:28,497
No fair, Mari.

188
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:31,000
You're keeping him
all to yourself!

189
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,004
Oh well.
I've got him now, don't I?

190
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:41,243
Damn it!

191
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:42,611
This is hurting, too!

192
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:44,046
But wait a sec.

193
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,482
The same thing
happened with that axe guy!

194
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,084
Now Gum-Gum...

195
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:51,687
...Gatling!

196
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,289
[SENTOMARU] Hoisa!

197
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:54,590
What the...?

198
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:57,760
Ashigara Dokkoi Shove!

199
00:12:57,793 --> 00:12:59,595
It's exactly like that!

200
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:03,399
But I don't think
he had Devil Fruit powers.

201
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:04,600
Then how?

202
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:07,570
If that's not it,
then how'd he do it?

203
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:10,172
You have power
just like me, huh?

204
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,608
A Paramythia type,
from the look of it.

205
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:14,109
Ha! I knew it!

206
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:16,745
Then why are you feeding
people this Gorgon crap?

207
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,380
That's a secret.

208
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:21,116
One my sisters and I will
take to the grave with us.

209
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,352
So don't bother asking.

210
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,188
I take it you
can't use Haki, then?

211
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,491
Most outsiders
never seem to get it.

212
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:30,559
That's why you're so weak.

213
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,230
That left kick won't work.

214
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,166
[SANDERSONIA laughing]

215
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:38,501
Try again!

216
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:41,070
She knows what I'm about to do!

217
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:46,408
[SANDERSONIA] Snake Slam!

218
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:48,210
Yes! Crush him!

219
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,480
That didn't hurt a bit!

220
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:53,382
Nice! I'm back to normal.

221
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:58,621
--[LUFFY] Gum-Gum Gatling!
--[SANDERSONIA] Snake Dance!

222
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:01,690
She's so fast!

223
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:03,726
And with her Haki,
she can see every attack

224
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,262
as soon as that
lout thinks it up!

225
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:10,566
[SANDERSONIA]
You're really simple-minded.

226
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,368
I can read you like a book.

227
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:13,569
How is she doing that?

228
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,205
I can't get a punch in on her!

229
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:18,741
[MARIGOLD] Seems you're
forgetting about someone.

230
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,376
Snake Stick!

231
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:22,912
Dammit!

232
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,213
You better be careful.

233
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:26,181
You might fall off the edge.

234
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:31,487
Not good!

235
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:45,334
[choking]

236
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,675
He's falling into the pit!

237
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,742
Kind of...

238
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:55,844
But he keeps bouncing
off of the guard railings.

239
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:59,690
Is it the end already?

240
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,895
Okay. Okay. Okay.

241
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:39,863
That was... almost bad.

242
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,565
So close! Dammit!

243
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,268
[DAISY giggling]

244
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:46,870
They'll probably knock
him right back down again!

245
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,105
I do admire his tenacity,

246
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:50,941
but he's really only bought
himself a few minutes at best.

247
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:53,377
He might as well have
kept falling if you ask me.

248
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:07,224
The Snake Princess just pushed
her hair back behind her ear!

249
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:11,328
Her beauty knows no bounds!
She's just perfect!

250
00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:15,232
He's the very definition
of "all bark and no bite".

251
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,167
He is funny, though.

252
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,078
Hey, lady! You suck!

253
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:32,683
How rude!

254
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:34,118
[AMAZON 413O]
The audacity!

255
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:35,285
Teach him a lesson!

256
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:37,955
[AMAZON 413P]
Come on! Skewer the beast!

257
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:39,990
No mercy!

258
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:42,426
Sonia! Marigold!

259
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,260
Kill him!

260
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,230
I can't tolerate him
a moment longer.

261
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:51,035
We must ensure,
once and for all...

262
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:54,071
...that his filthy
outbursts are silenced!

263
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,979
I was hoping we
could drag this out.

264
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:04,648
But, well,
you heard our big sister.

265
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:07,317
It's a pity we
can't prolong your pain.

266
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:09,586
[SANDERSONIA] Indeed, sister,
but at the very least,

267
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,122
we'll show him
a taste of despair.

268
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:20,230
No! Margaret!

269
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:26,570
Whoa! What the
hell are you doing?

270
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:28,338
You leave her alone!

271
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,010
Hey! Stop!

272
00:17:33,043 --> 00:17:35,145
You're gonna end up
breaking her!

273
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:39,616
Good idea.

274
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,653
She saved your life, you said?

275
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,288
Then she deserves it!

276
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,090
There you have it, sis!

277
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:49,259
We've found a new way to make
him suffer before he dies!

278
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:50,127
Don't be stupid!

279
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,130
This is a duel
between you two and me!

280
00:17:53,163 --> 00:17:56,366
Noooooo! Stop!

281
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,601
Above.

282
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,172
Don't! Let her go!

283
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:14,384
[LUFFY] Let me go,
you stupid snake!

284
00:18:14,418 --> 00:18:17,387
I'm afraid you're the only one
who thought this was a duel.

285
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:19,590
This is clearly
a public execution.

286
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:20,724
[SANDERSONIA]
Compared to the trauma

287
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:22,726
you caused our poor sister,

288
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:25,229
this is the least
we can do to you!

289
00:18:25,262 --> 00:18:26,630
In this proud nation,

290
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:29,633
all of the women look up
to the Snake Princess!

291
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,535
Her beauty is unparalleled.

292
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,470
She's strong and noble.

293
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:35,139
She's called the
"Pirate Empress"...

294
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:36,740
...Boa Hancock!

295
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:47,384
Do you know how she felt?

296
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:51,121
She loves this country
and this is how you treat her?

297
00:18:51,155 --> 00:18:53,323
Our empress is popular.

298
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:55,492
Your friend would
agree with her punishment.

299
00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:57,060
Like hell she would!

300
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,729
What are you? Some kinda idiot?

301
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,632
How rude! Such language!

302
00:19:03,534 --> 00:19:06,303
[MARIGOLD] After we take care
of this honest little traitor,

303
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:08,605
we'll turn these
self-sacrificing friends of hers

304
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:11,842
into pretty little
piles of rubble.

305
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,512
And when we do,
you'll have a front row seat.

306
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:16,547
Wait!

307
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:24,621
[SANDERSONIA] Here goes! Three!

308
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:26,290
No! Don't do it!

309
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,193
[SANDERSONIA] Two!

310
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:30,494
Listen to me, please!

311
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:32,162
Just put her down!

312
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,299
Give up.

313
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:37,701
One.

314
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:39,503
No! Margaret!

315
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:52,149
I said stop! That's enough!

316
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:53,243
[AMAZON cries out]

317
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:12,462
[AMAZON 413R] Ahh!
The warriors are fainting!

318
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,419
Absurd. It can't be.

319
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:44,761
Oh, what a relief!

320
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:47,931
She's not cracked
or broken or anything!

321
00:21:47,964 --> 00:21:50,634
All right, guess
you're not so bad, huh?

322
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:55,672
[laughing]

323
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:58,375
Unreal.

324
00:21:58,408 --> 00:22:00,010
That was the Conqueror's Spirit.

325
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:01,244
You're kidding!

326
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,448
Only one out of a million people
can summon forth that Haki,

327
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:07,417
let alone control it!

328
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,953
[SANDERSONIA] I've never seen
anyone besides our big sister

329
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:11,855
do something like that!

330
00:22:11,888 --> 00:22:14,424
[MARIGOLD] This boy has
the "Qualities of a Conqueror".

331
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,627
The ability to
stand above all others!

332
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,001
The same as me.

333
00:22:25,035 --> 00:22:26,970
There's no doubt about it.

334
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:28,839
He wields such power.

335
00:22:28,872 --> 00:22:31,007
But who the hell is this boy?

336
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,909
Is he toying with us?

337
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,613
[AMAZON 413S] Am I dreaming?

338
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,982
That didn't really
just happen, did it?

339
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:40,650
What the heck's
everyone babbling about?

340
00:22:40,684 --> 00:22:43,353
What's the big deal?
Did I miss something?

341
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:46,523
I don't think he
realizes he used Haki.

342
00:22:46,556 --> 00:22:49,326
I guess he doesn't
know how to control it, then.

343
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:52,929
All right!

344
00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:56,500
I get it now.
You two girls are really strong.

345
00:23:01,872 --> 00:23:04,975
Back to the duel. Round two.

346
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:15,952
[NARRATOR] When Luffy
activates Second Gear,

347
00:23:15,986 --> 00:23:18,321
the sisters respond by
unleashing their true

348
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,523
Snake-Snake powers.

349
00:23:19,556 --> 00:23:22,959
Sandersonia transforms her
hair into ferocious serpents,

350
00:23:22,993 --> 00:23:25,095
and Marigold envelops
her body in flame

351
00:23:25,128 --> 00:23:27,097
as they launch an
even more violent assault

352
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,999
in the arena of battle.

353
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,634
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

354
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,669
All-Out Special Power Battle!

355
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,805
Gum-Gum vs. Snake-Snake!
