00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:58,737
when they get a load of me!

181
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,115
Better do exactly as I say,
or these hostages are dead!

182
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:03,533
[KOBATO, NAMI scream]

183
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:05,076
All right!

184
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,413
Order your buffoons to stand
down and let us board our ship!

00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:09,664
[DRAKE grunts]

186
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:10,582
Now I get it.

187
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:11,750
Interesting.

188
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,251
Do it!

189
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,420
Double-time, or I'll snap
these girls' necks like twigs!

190
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:17,297
And their blood'll
be on your hands!

191
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,965
I'd do as he says, guys.

192
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:21,051
He's serious. If you haven't
seen the neck snap thing,

193
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:22,093
it's pretty messy.

194
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:23,595
[grumbles]

195
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:26,139
How would it look if you,
the righteous arm of justice,

196
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:27,807
{\an8}let two women die?

197
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,934
Chopper!

198
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:31,311
What are you doing?

199
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:32,270
That's not helping.

200
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:33,730
Plug it, you idiot!

201
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:35,732

203

He's gonna kill us!

Please, do what he says!

205
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:45,575
I can't die
before I get married!

206

[DRAKE groans]

207
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:03,843
No, no!

208
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:05,053
Faster!

209
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,888
How many times do I
have to go over this?

210
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:08,556
We have 1,000 mouths to feed!

211
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,100
Speed is of the essence!

212
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:12,644
Pick it up, or pack it up!

213
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:14,020
You didn't need to hit us.

214
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:16,564
Oh, really? So you
have a grievance?

215
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,024
Because let me be clear.

216
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:20,068
First, you two muttons need
to prove yourselves worthy

217
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:21,403
of being in this kitchen!

218
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:25,073
Now get over here and peel
the potatoes! All 3,000!

219
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:27,325
Is it just me, or is
Jessica a little tense?

220
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,119
She's having trouble
coming to terms with the fact

221
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:31,079
that our star cook
turned out to be a pirate.

222
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:32,997
And the fact that the
real new guys are nothing

223
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,291
but incompetent losers.

224
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,669
Another word and I'll
boil your tongues!

225
00:10:37,752 --> 00:10:38,545
[BOTH]
Yes, ma'am!

226
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:40,046
Hey, Billy.

227
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,048
Why don't ya do me a favor and
try out the special sauce!

228
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:45,385
Pretty amazing stuff, eh?

229
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:46,803
--Well?
--It tastes good.

230
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:48,221
Honestly, it does.

231
00:10:48,304 --> 00:10:51,016
Not to be a jerk,
but isn't that our House sauce?

232
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:52,892
Precisely. Yeah!

233
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:55,937
Ya know what? That pirate
may have lied about his name,

234
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:59,524
but there's absolutely no
questioning his culinary skills.

235
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,234
I mean, we are good cooks,

236
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:02,527
but he had real flair.

237
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,446
He did have flair,
that's for sure.

238
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,281
A shame...

239
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:09,075
[SHINPACHI] Damn it!
What did he do different?

240
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,035
[VICE HEAD CHEF]
Jessica?

241
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:12,495
[JESSICA]
Hm... Yes, what?

242
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,956
Perhaps this could
be of some use.

243
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,208
It seems he left some
detailed notes and

244
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:19,711
recipes for various
dishes he prepared.

245
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:22,005
--That pirate left us what?
--You said, full recipes?

246
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:23,631
Ah! Yeah, come to think of it...

247
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:27,385
Hey, thank you. I'll be sure to
write down some of my recipes.

248
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:30,096
What makes you think I care?

249
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,932
Uh, I, um, I was hoping that...

250
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:34,059
Well, since he did leave it,

251
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:36,061
what would be the
harm in using a few?

252
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:37,395
Idiot! Give me that!

253
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,147
Utterly pathetic, all of you!

254
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,565
And you dare stand
there and call

255
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:42,692
yourselves loyal to Navarone?

256
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:45,445
If you accept this pirate's
help, if you use one note

257
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:48,615
on this page, then you
betray our heritage!

258
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:49,741
Sorry...

259
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:52,369

Can't you fools even handle

00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:58,875
a simple task like
peeling potatoes?!

Uh, well, our men did it.

turn out that--

is a battlefield!

nothing to worry about.

with your demands.

Now, release the hostages!

give the orders here!

00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:34,275
my gratitude's lacking now.

358
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:37,696
Give a girl some
warning next time, huh!

359
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:40,073
All right, everyone! Look alive!

360
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:44,661
[siren blaring]

361
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:46,913
[CANNONEER A] Straight ahead!
Isn't that the pirate ship?

362
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:49,165
[CANNONEER B] Yeah, and we've
got her dead in our sights!

363
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:51,376
Why won't they give
the order to attack?

364
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:52,669
[CANNONEER A]
I hear they have a hostage.

365
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:54,087
Some nurse they captured.

366
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,213
Poor woman must be losing her

367
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:57,090
mind being handled
by such filth!

368
00:16:57,173 --> 00:16:59,592
Pirates! I could sink
the whole lot of'em!

369
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:00,969
[CANNONEER B]
Think I've spotted her!

370
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:02,679
Yeah! The hostage is safe.

371
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:04,889
And givin' 'em orders?

372
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:07,892
What a fiasco!

373
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:09,728
Are the ships ready to launch?

374
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,479
[MARINE I]
Almost! A few minutes more!

375
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,355
[KOBATO]
Daddy!

376
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,565
[MECHAO]
Kobato!

377
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:15,608
Now this is how I like
to see my baby girl.

378
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:16,735
Safe and sound.

379
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,069
[KOBATO giggles]

380
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:20,363
[DRAKE] You released the
ship, didn't you, old man?

381
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:22,490
You've caused
a real mess this time!

382
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,243
And I can assure you,
you will be punished.

383
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:27,954
What father in his right mind
would sit idly by and watch

384
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:30,749
his daughter fall in
harm's way when he can stop it?

385
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:33,376
[DRAKE] A plan was underway!
Kobato had been rescued!

386
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,836
We had it under control!

387
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:35,879
And the other girl?

388
00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:38,256
You completely
botched her rescue!

389
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,549
[DRAKE grunts]

390
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:40,508
[MECHAO] I wasn't willing
to risk my daughter

391
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,385
as collateral damage!

392
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:45,138
You could learn a thing or two
from Commander Jonathan!

393
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:46,556
[DRAKE grunts]

394
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:48,933
Sir, I have some more
information about the hostage!

395
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:51,811
Intel suggests the hostage
may actually be a crewmember

396
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:53,146
of the Straw Hat Pirates!

397
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:54,522
She's what?

398
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:01,571
[MARINE M]
Halt, inspector.

399
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:03,198
What's your destination?

400
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:05,700
I'm under orders to
investigate all passersby.

401
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:09,871
I don't believe that I'm
required to report my actions.

402
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:11,915
[MARINE M]
Yes, but we are.

403
00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:13,083
Fine.

404
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,293
Tell the commander
I had fun playing him.

405
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:16,169
[gasps]

406
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:18,380
He was an easy mark. Heh.

407
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,507
[MARINE M]
Screw you!

408
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,592
[MARINE M gasps]

409
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:24,969
[ROBIN]
I guess I won't be needing

410
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:26,763
this disguise any longer.

411
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:31,518
[ZORO] Why are we hugging
the edge of this cliff?

412
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:32,644
[NAMI]
Protection!

413
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:34,104
We'd have cannons
blasting us from

414
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:36,064
both sides if we went
through the middle!

415
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:37,857
[USOPP gasping]
Where am I?

416
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:39,776
[LUFFY]
Oh, he's awake!

417
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:40,902
[USOPP]
This is Merry.

418
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:42,195
How did we get back?

419
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:44,030
[LUFFY] With a hostage
and a quick flight!

420
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:45,865
[USOPP]
I see! Nami was the hostage!

421
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:46,741
Nice touch!

422
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,909
[NAMI]
Wasn't it, though?

423
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:49,327
[USOPP] You are good
at tricking people.

424
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:50,829
[thud]

425
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,456
[ZORO] Still, Nami
didn't make the ship start

426
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,083
moving on its own.
How'd that happen?

427
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,501
[USOPP]
If I had to guess, I'd say

428
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,086
it was the old maintenance guy.

429
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:00,213
--[ZORO] Why's that?
--[USOPP] Just a feeling.

430
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:03,049
[SNAIL PHONE ringing]

431
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:06,302
Nami dressed as a
nurse is pure magic!

432
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:11,224
Well we escaped, but what good
are we without maps or charts?

433
00:19:11,307 --> 00:19:13,518
We were way better off
with you guys in jail!

434
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:14,436
What'll we do now?

435
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,646
[SANJI laughs]
Robin!

436
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:19,733
[SANJI]
Now there's a girl with style!

437
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,443
[JONATHAN]
Major Shepherd was a fake?

438
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:23,236
Where is she now?

439
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,904
[MARINE P]
I'm sorry, sir.

440
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:26,031
She got away.

441
00:19:26,114 --> 00:19:28,074
You're not at
fault here, soldier.

442
00:19:28,158 --> 00:19:31,661
I have a habit of letting my
guard down around pretty women.

443
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:32,954
[MARINE P]
Sir?

444
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,998
Anyway, this makes a total
of six accomplices.

445
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:36,541
We're currently searching
for the last one!

446
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:37,709
No need.

447
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,711
You can stop looking.
I've located her.

448
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:40,587
[MARINE P]
Sir?

449
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,089
I called the medical station.

450
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:46,259
They said their nursing staff
has all been accounted for.

451
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:48,970
[NAMI]
A map of the fortress!

452
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,056
I thought you might
find it useful.

453
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:53,558
It's amazing!

454
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:56,644
Wow, you just gave us
a way to escape here!

455
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,479
Good...

456
00:19:57,562 --> 00:20:00,482
[cannon fire]

457
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,567
[LUFFY]
They're shooting at us!

458
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,860
I thought they weren't
gonna attack us

459
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:05,153
because we had a hostage?

460
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:07,197
We knew it was only
gonna be a matter of time!

461
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,533
Did we also realize they'd
send warships after us?

462
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:12,410
[DRAKE]
There is no hostage on board!

463
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:14,662
Open fire! I repeat!

464
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,916
All cannons are free
to fire at will!

465
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,250
[NAMI]
Look! There's our exit.

466
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:20,919
The Sea Gate.

467
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,171
Usopp! Prepare the bow cannon!

468
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:25,840
Chopper! Make extra certain
you follow my orders!

469
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,467
No problem!

470
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,344
This is the base's only way out!

471
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,596
We'll have to break
through that gate!

472
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,473
But these shoal markings
can't be right!

473
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:35,558
The water's just
way too shallow.

474
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,102
So why put a port here?

475
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:38,645
It's wrong!

476
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:41,398
Something doesn't make sense.

477
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:42,565
[JONATHAN]
I see.

478
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:44,776
It's all-clear on
your end? That's good.

479
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:47,028
Keep watch and don't fire
until I give the order.

480
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,446
Priority report, sir.

481
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,739
We have confirmation

482
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:51,658
that the pirate ship
has reached the Sea Gate.

483
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:53,785
[JONATHAN]
Checkmate.

484
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:55,954
Your time's up, Straw Hat.

485
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,497
And, inevitably...

486
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,165
...you will lose.

487
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:02,127
[NAMI] Are you kidding me? We
don't have a single cannonball?

488
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,546
Not a one!
No explosives of any kind.

489
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:06,464
Not even the boxes they came in!

490
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:08,591
Well, that's hardly surprising,

491
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:11,094
given that they
confiscated the Going Merry.

492
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:12,679
What'll we do?

493
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:14,848
We can't bust through that gate
without some serious firepower!

494
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:16,808
[ZORO] We can, but we have
to be smart about it.

495
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:19,853
All we gotta do is gain
control of that gatehouse.

496
00:21:19,936 --> 00:21:21,730
[USOPP] Don't talk
like it's gonna be easy!

497
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:25,025
[LUFFY] It is!
'Cause I have a great idea!

498
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:26,317
[CANNONEER CAPTAIN]
Get ready!

499
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:27,569
Lock on target!

500
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:29,779
Attack!

501
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:33,658
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Balloon!

502
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:37,412
[LUFFY grunts]

503
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:56,848
It worked!

504
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:58,892
That's one way to do it!

505
00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:01,227
Good job, Luffy!

506
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:03,563
Now let's sail outta here!

507
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,735
[NAMI] Wait, if they took
all the cannonballs--

00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:46,624
It's impossible to sneak
past the cannoneers

531
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,710
and vanish in that short a time!

532
00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:51,087
[JONATHAN] I know for certain
they won't try to escape.

533
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:52,756
[NAMI] Without the gold,
there's no point!

534
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:55,216
I mean, whoever heard of pirates
leaving treasure behind?!

535
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,677
It's shameful!
Right rudder, full!

536
00:23:57,761 --> 00:23:59,554
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

537
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:03,767
"The Pirate Ship Disappears!
Fortress Battle, Round #2"

538
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,770
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
