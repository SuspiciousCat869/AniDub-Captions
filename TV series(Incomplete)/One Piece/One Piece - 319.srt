1
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:36,723
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:40,661
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:44,097
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,269
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,772
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,139
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,343
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,545
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:02,116
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:05,185
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,655
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:13,894
[SANJI] Excuse me!

13
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,362
A couple of water-water
candies, please!

14
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,530
[PRODUCE GUY 319A] You got it!

15
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:20,000
I must say, ha ha,
that BBQ yesterday--

16
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,336
It was the best
I've had in ages!

17
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,537
Thanks!

18
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,806
I'd expect no less since
you use the best ingredients!

19
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,176
Yep! Only the best
will do. See ya!

20
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,111
[CHIMNEY] Goodbye, grocery guy!

21
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:32,780
[PRODUCE GUY 319A]
Thanks! Come again!

22
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,017
Look! The pirate
ladies are over there!

23
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,851
[SANJI] Uah! They are?

24
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,052
[hollers]

25
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,188
Nami-swan!

26
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,023
Would you mind telling us
how you two ladies

27
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,158
came to be a part of
the Straw Hat pirates?

28
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,660
--Nami, Robin!
--What difficulties do you face

29
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,629
--Mellorine!
--being a pirate and a woman?

30
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,096
--[SANJI] I'm over here!
--[NAMI] It's hard to say.

31
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,232
That's more of a private
matter, don't you think?

32
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,501
Doesn't look like we'll
get much shopping done.

33
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,737
What do you like?
What are you into?

34
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,339
I don't know...

35
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,706
[SANJI]

36
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,874
Oh, but I do!

37
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,643
Nami's going to say
that she likes me!

38
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,779
--[SANJI] Over here, Nami! Look!
--What's that crazy pirate cook

39
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:05,779
--Yoo-hoo!
--yelling about?

40
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,080
--Anything come to mind?
--Meow!

41
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,481
Thanks for the photos!
Now, do you think we can

42
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,151
get a few of you two
in swim suits?

43
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,553
[SANJI] Swim suits?

44
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,355
[REPORTER 319A] It'll be a
big hit! What do you say?

45
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,589
Hmmm.

46
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:16,723
[MEN gasp]

47
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,758
[NAMI] I can't believe you!
What kind of a girl

48
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,926
do you think I am?

49
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,261
[REPORTER 319A]
Uh! I'm so sorry, ma'am!

50
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,828
If you want something,

51
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,563
then you have
to talk price first.

52
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,765
Huh?

53
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:27,068
[giggles] Are you serious?

54
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,201
Well, of course I am!

55
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,337
Luffy's party cost
100 million Berries!

56
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,005
We have to make
that money back somehow,

57
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,941
and this is
an easy way to do it!

58
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,442
Wait a minute.

59
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,312
They wanna take some pictures of
Nami and Robin in swim suits?

60
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,381
[SANJI] Meaning "bikinis"?

61
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,617
And sexy poses?

62
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,652
[ALL giggle]

63
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,120
Perverts!

64
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,190
I can't believe you'd
ask these ladies to do that!

65
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,359
Ah! This guy's
part of their crew!

66
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,260
I'm sorry, sir!

67
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,728
[NAMI] Where'd he come from?

68
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,096
[MEN yell]

69
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,130
[SANJI] If I catch any
of you bothering them again,

70
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,632
you're dead! You hear me?

71
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,834
Take your pictures and your
questions and get outta here!

72
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,536
[SANJI grunts]

73
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,138
Aaah!

74
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,239
Dear Nami. Sweet Robin.

75
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,742
You ladies shouldn't have any
more trouble from that bunch.

76
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,843
I took care of it.

77
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,212
Well, so much
for the photoshoot,

78
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:13,681
but at least we can
do our shopping in peace.

79
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:14,882
[SANJI] Just like that,

80
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,784
an opportunity for
a date presents itself!

81
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,220
[SANJI] So since all of our
schedules have opened up a bit,

82
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:21,589
might I suggest we
take a break from shopping,

83
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:22,923
--Hey. Mr. Pirate Cook!
--enjoy the city a bit and find

84
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:23,924
--Hey!
--a nice restaurant where the

85
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:24,792
--Hey!
--three of us could--

86
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,093
What? What is it?

87
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,661
[CHIMNEY]
I'm hungry. Can we eat?

88
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,596
[SANJI] I just gave you
some water-water candy

89
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,497
a few minutes ago!

90
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:34,635
I'm hungry!
I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

91
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,970
Now listen to me.

92
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,805
If you wanna eat,
I'll give you some money

93
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,306
and you can find something.

94
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,875
[SANJI] I'm trying to set up
at date, get the picture?

95
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,176
I need alone time.

96
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,312
[CHIMNEY]
I don't wanna eat... alone!

97
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,081
[CHIMNEY and GONBE] Wa! Wa!

98
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,749
You're not fooling anyone!

99
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,217
Aw, it's okay, Chimney!

100
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:52,219
Sanji may seem rude
from time to time,

101
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:54,754
but he'd never really
be mean to a girl.

102
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,523
That's true!
He's not the type of man

103
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,393
who would ever
let down a lady in need.

104
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,794
Aw, come on.

105
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,062
Robin, I---

106
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,197
[BOTH giggle]

107
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,132
Then it's settled.
Be good, Chimney!

108
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,000
Do whatever Sanji says, okay?

109
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,902
[CHIMNEY] Okay!

110
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:08,936
[ROBIN] Bye!

111
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,172
No way!

112
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,639
[SANJI] Why'd they
have to put it that way!

113
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,008
My date plans are ruined!

114
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,145
[SANJI]
Well, it's a lady's request.

115
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:20,247
So, you know where
we can get something

116
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,083
good to eat around here?

117
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,450
[CHIMNEY] All right!
[GONBE] Meow! Meow!

118
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:24,517
--[SANJI] Lead the way!
--[CHIMNEY and GONBE] Yeah!

119
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,558
[LUFFY] Sanji's Shock!

120
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:35,228
Mysterious Old Man and
His Super Yummy Cooking!

121
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,200
[SANJI] You sure
this is the right place?

122
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,336
Doesn't look like there's
much food around here.

123
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:43,370
[CHIMNEY] Yep!

124
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,239
It's a place run by
a friend of Granny's!

125
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,073
[SANJI]
A friend of Kokoro's, huh?

126
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,543
I gotta say, even though
your cooking is really good,

127
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,946
Grandpa's cooking
is way, way better!

128
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,413
Meow!

129
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,282
Oh? Is that so?

130
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:56,450
[CHIMNEY] Ah! There it is!

131
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,452
That boat at the
bottom of the stairs!

132
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,620
Man, did that food
taste weird or what?

133
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,858
Yeah, sorry--I heard this
place was s'posed to be good.

134
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,060
And here I thought
I was finally gonna get

135
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,361
[CITIZEN 319A]
a decent meal around here.

136
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,629
[CITIZEN 319B] I know, right?

137
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,064
Tastes weird?

138
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,599
[CHIMNEY] Step! Step! Step!

139
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,532
Here we are!

140
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,101
--[CHIMNEY giggle]
--[GONBE] Meow!

141
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:18,105
Hey! Grandpa Cook!
Make us something to eat!

142
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,040
This drunk old man
can really cook?

143
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,975
You sure this is the right guy?

144
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,844
Hey! I'm hungry!

145
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,346
Wake up!

146
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,647
Meow!

147
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,381
[sighs] Just let him sleep.

148
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,484
He's got ingredients, so I'll
prepare something myself.

149
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,789
I gotta say, he's got a
really nice kitchen here.

150
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:38,458
Hungry! Hungry! I'm hungry!

151
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,993
I thought he was
just an old drunk,

152
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,729
but these knives are nice.

153
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,396
He might be good after all.

154
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,701
[SANJI] Here we go!

155
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:02,949
[snoring]

156
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,517
Uh?

157
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,889
Sorry, old man.
I started helping myself.

158
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:10,791
[CHIMNEY]
Good morning, Grandpa Cook!

159
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,293
[GONBE] Meow!

160
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,462
Hey, kid. That's an interesting
cutting technique there.

161
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,132
Where'd you learn how to
do something like that?

162
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:22,236
Ah. I learned when I was
working on the Baratie.

163
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,671
It's ready. Here you go.

164
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:26,473
All right! Thanks a lot!

165
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:30,544
[CHIMNEY] Delicious!

166
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:33,480
Heh! I'm guessing you're
Zeff's apprentice, then?

167
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:38,886
No way! You mean you know
that worthless old geezer?

168
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,654
There's no mistaking
that knife technique.

169
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,523
That kid Zeff used to cut
things the exact same way.

170
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,826
"Kid," huh?
That "kid" used to be

171
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,894
the captain of a
pirate crew, you know.

172
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,830
Heh! To me,
he's nothing but a kid,

173
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,132
and that's all he'll ever be!

174
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,267
[chuckles]

175
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,203
So, what the heck
are you doing way out here

176
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,805
in Water 7, anyway?

177
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,239
Did you get tired
of Zeff's attitude

178
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,041
and run away
from his restaurant?

179
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,876
No, it's not that.

180
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,912
I'm searching for the All Blue.

181
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,013
The All Blue, huh?

182
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,483
[SANJI] Yeah, if the waters
there have marine life

183
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,184
from all over the world,
that means they have

184
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,287
the best ingredients, too.

185
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,357
In order to find it, I set
sail and became a pirate.

186
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,225
[laughs]

187
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,127
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Crazy, right?

188
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,864
I suppose you think it's a
legend, just like everyone else.

189
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,466
[OLD COOK] No, sir. It exists.

190
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,701
Huh?

191
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,036
If you're a true cook,
you must have seen it

192
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,770
at least once in your dreams.

193
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,239
If you're determined
and motivated,

194
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:35,276
there's no place in
the world you can't reach.

195
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,643
[sighs]

196
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,513
[OLD COOK] You're not the first.
Since that legend was born,

197
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:41,949
many have searched for
that miraculous place.

198
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,951
It's a cruel sea
that destroys the dreams

199
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,720
of those who seek
to discover it.

200
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:47,187
[SANJI] Hold on a sec.

201
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,289
Sounds like you're awfully
familiar with all of this stuff!

202
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,191
Old man, have you
actually been there?

203
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,627
Did you... find the All Blue?

204
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,494
No, I didn't.

205
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,896
[SANJI]
Don't tease me like that!

206
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,330
I was simply describing
the picture of it

207
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,399
I had in my mind
in my younger days.

208
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,069
Then you should have
said so from the start. Jeez.

209
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,137
You're off your rocker, old man.

210
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:07,374
Come on! I'm already
out of sake again?

211
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,343
That was amazing!

212
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,077
Meow!

213
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,317
Take it. As payment for
letting us use your kitchen.

214
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:19,519
Heh. Thanks! Much obliged!

215
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,856
[SANJI] All right, you two.
Let's start heading back.

216
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,891
Awe... But I'm still hungry!

217
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,359
Meow!

218
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:28,596
[SANJI] What? You're like a
couple of bottomless pits.

219
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,830
[laughs] Hey, kid. Hold on.

220
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,332
To show my gratitude
for the sake,

221
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:33,800
let me make you some food.

222
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,469
[SANJI] Aw, don't do that.

223
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:36,537
Feed me!

224
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,671
Meow!

225
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,174
[OLD COOK] Don't be
so polite! It's no problem!

226
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,975
[SANJI] Whoa!
Take it easy there, gramps!

227
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,712
Listen! I'm the best chef
in the whole darn city

00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:48,416
[SANJI] Come on! Don't
get so worked up!

231
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,084
I've got a good doctor
on my crew who can

232
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:53,386
take a look at--
Don't do that yourself!

233
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,725
[OLD COOK] Oh. Heh.

234
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:01,428
He can barely stand up! Is he
really gonna try to cook?

235
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,635
Aye!

236
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,703
Aah!

Hey... Seriously,
you don't have to do that.

239
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,842
Listen, if you'd like, I could--

240
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,777
Stop trying to
interfere, you brat!

241
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,613
What?
I was just trying to--

242
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:22,249
Stay on that side of the
counter and let me cook!

243
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,584
[SANJI] Fine. Whatever.
Have it your way.

244
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:30,991
[SANJI] You gotta be kidding.

00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,626
Look at his hands shaking.

246

he's gonna chop his fingers off!

So good!

00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,572
[SANJI] He's got skills,
I'll give him that.

253
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:21,041
But it didn't look like
he used a lot of seasoning.

254
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,109
What's wrong, kid?

255
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,378
You scared it's gonna taste bad?

Not at all.

Thanks so much for making it.

00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,657
[SANJI] This stuff is amazing!

260
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,861
[SANJI] Our cooking
styles were the same.

261
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,362
Our ingredients were the same.

262
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,664
But the flavor!

263
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,066
Why does his taste so damn good?

00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,169
Hey, what's the matter, kiddo?

265
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,371
You never had food
this tasty before?

--Thanks again, Grandpa!
--Meow, meow, meow!

[SANJI] No, actually.

268
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:01,048
So are you able to pinpoint
what makes it so delicious?

00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,383
No, I'm not.

That's too bad.
I'm disappointed in you, kid.

00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:09,490
If you can't understand
something as basic as that,

273
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:12,792
the All Blue might just be
out of your reach forever.

[chuckling]

280
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:33,047
[SANJI] If it's not about
the cooking or the ingredients,

281
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,415
then there's gotta
be something else!

282
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:58,672
Well! Unless I'm mistaken,

283
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,841
you're the cook from
the Straw Hat crew, right?

284
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,743
How may I help you?

285
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:03,811
[SANJI] These spices...

286
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,346
Are they the only ones you have?

00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,380
Yeah.

288
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:09,716
We're a little short
on stock, unfortunately.

That's not it.

00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:15,222
That's not it, either.

00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,957
[SANJI] You sure you
don't have anything else?

292

Yep, pretty sure!

293
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:20,127
Water 7 is more
of a trading town.

294
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,829
So we're not really
known for our own exports.

295
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,865
That would include
any seasonings.

296
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,366
[SANJI] No luck at all.

297
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,903
Maybe that old geezer makes
some kind of spice himself.

00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,839
What if I combine--
No, that's not right.

I don't think he noticed us.

That is strange.

some kind of game

want any of this stuff!

00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,302
I just think I discovered
the secret of his flavor!

349
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:10,804
I'm so glad I tasted this!

350
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,039
Thanks a lot!

351
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,140
You've helped me
more than you'll ever know!

352
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:16,443
[CHIMNEY] Your turn!

353
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,215
Meow!

354
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:23,517
[OLD COOK shushing]

355
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,751
[SANJI] Old man!

356
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:28,722
I think I found my answer.

357
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:30,090
Don't scare me like that!

358
00:16:30,124 --> 00:16:31,725
Welcome back,
Mister Pirate Cook!

359
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:32,759
Meow, meow!

360
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:33,928
Right. Listen.

361
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,228
That unique flavor of yours

362
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:37,565
doesn't come from
any sort of special spice.

363
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:38,632
The secret?

364
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,301
It comes from the very
basis of all seasoning.

365
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,503
From salt.

366
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:44,938
Those rice balls you made
for the Galley La workers,

367
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:47,007
they had the same flavor.

368
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,776
So is he right?

369
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:50,911
Basically, yes.

370
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,579
But there's a bit more
to it than that.

371
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,181
The problem is even after
everywhere I've sailed,

372
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:58,518
I've never come across
a salt quite like this one.

373
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:00,086
[SANJI] It's not
a matter of quality.

374
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,423
There's something fundamentally
different about it.

375
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,057
So why does
such a unique salt

376
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:06,594
seem to exist
only on this island?

377
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,595
The answer is simple.

378
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,099
It's Aqua Laguna.

379
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:14,902
That storm is troublesome,
there's no doubt about it.

380
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:16,303
But as it grows,

381
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,638
its waves carry minerals
from seas all around the world,

382
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:21,408
making a unique seawater.

383
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:23,778
[SANJI] And a salt made
from all of those minerals

384
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:25,779
would be equally as unique.

385
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:30,751
That is your secret.

386
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:31,619
You got it!

387
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:33,420
That's the answer, kid!

388
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,923
[SANJI]
But that's not the end of it.

389
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:36,990
In order to make salt,

390
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,659
you need a
whole lot of seawater.

391
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,994
But here, the seawater
you're extracting it from

392
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:42,495
comes in on a storm.

393
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,097
There's gotta be
some special method

394
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:45,766
to do something like that.

395
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,100
Listen to me.

396
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,302
I always want my crew
to eat the very best food.

397
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,272
Not only should it be
healthy and nourishing,

398
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:53,240
it should be delicious, too.

399
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,076
[SANJI] I know it's
your own special recipe,

400
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:57,011
and I have no right
to ask, but please!

401
00:17:57,044 --> 00:17:59,346
I need to know the
secrets of your salt!

402
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:02,449
My, my.

403
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,686
Lovely weather we're
having today, isn't it?

404
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:06,954
[SANJI] Yeah.

405
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:08,922
[OLD COOK] Each year,
right after Aqua Laguna,

406
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:11,225
we're blessed with
beautiful, sunny weather.

407
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,227
There's a place
close by I'd like to go.

408
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,863
You think maybe
you could take me there?

409
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:17,631
I guess, but why?

410
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,667
Up there.

411
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,737
I'd like you to take me to
the rooftop of that building.

412
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,170
Okay.

413
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,807
[SANJI]
This the right spot, Old Man?

414
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,041
[OLD COOK] Yep.

415
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,744
Oh! Looks like it's ready!

416
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,045
What's ready?

417
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,348
The salt? Stop kidding around.

418
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,349
[OLD COOK]
No, I'm serious. Look.

419
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,419
[OLD COOK]
This is where it comes from.

420
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:43,823
Aqua Laguna rolls in
and covers all the rooftops.

421
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:46,359
[OLD COOK] After a while,
when the storm finally recedes,

422
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:51,231
the salt left behind from those
giant-sized waves starts to dry.

423
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:54,768
[OLD COOK] After it completely
dries up, what remains is this.

424
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:56,269
Of course! I get it!

425
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,806
It makes perfect sense, but--
hey, wait a minute!

426
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,809
Are you saying every
rooftop in Water 7

427
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:03,244
is covered with this stuff?

428
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,211
[OLD COOK] That's right!

429
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,545
Nothing special about this one.

430
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,447
Every roof in the
city's the same way.

431
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,617
The salt is dry
and ready for use.

432
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,584
Incredible!

433
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,486
There's so much of it!

434
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,654
Hey, kid.

435
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,055
Don't forget:

436
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,324
Not just any seawater
could've created salt like this.

437
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:18,492
Only one sea in the world

438
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:21,495
could've combined
all these elements.

439
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,163
The All Blue.

440
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:29,369
Look at you!

441
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,804
Quite a haul you've got there!

442
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,740
Is all of that salt?

443
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:33,941
Meow!

444
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:35,442
There's still a long
journey ahead of us.

445
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:36,777
I need this to last.

446
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,945
Oh, and I was curious.

447
00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:39,446
When we first
arrived at your boat,

448
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,182
there were two men walking away
complaining about the food.

449
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:45,051
[CITIZEN 319A] Man, did that
food taste weird or what?

450
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:46,987
Yeah. Those two.

451
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,289
I remember.

452
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:50,156
[CITIZEN 319A] Hey! Old Man!

453
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:52,225
[CITIZEN 319A]
Think you can make me

454
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,194
some more of that
food I had earlier?

455
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,695
[CITIZEN 319A] I thought it
tasted kind of weird at first,

456
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:57,964
but I haven't been able
to stop thinking about it!

457
00:19:57,998 --> 00:19:59,934
Guess I wasn't
used to the flavor.

458
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,635
That doesn't make
any sense to me at all.

459
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:03,737
This happens from
time to time with sailors.

460
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:06,941
These boys get so used to
eating bad food on their ships,

461
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:08,375
it becomes the expectation.

462
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,044
Then their taste buds
awaken again

463
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:11,545
and they come back for more.

464
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,947
I think I'll take a double
order this time, please!

465
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,816
Come on, Old Man!
We're begging you!

466
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,050
[chuckling]

467
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,319
Hey, Old Man.

468
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:20,354
You've got some
amazing cooking skills.

469
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:23,457
Why do you stay hidden
away out here in Water 7?

470
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,691
[chuckling]

471
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,794
I can't bear to leave all
that delicious salt behind!

472
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:27,828
Kinda crazy, huh?

473
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:29,096
I see.

474
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,330
Well, for what it's worth,

475
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:31,832
the next time
I come through here,

476
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:35,469
I'll bring you some directly
from the All Blue itself.

477
00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:38,005
Sounds good! I'm gonna
hold you to that, kid!

478
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:39,773
[PRETTY GIRL 319A] Hey Gramps!

479
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:42,376
Good to see you!
Is your shop open?

480
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,310
Yes!

481
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,211
It's always open
for you lovely ladies!

482
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,781
[PRETTY GIRLS]
You're such a cutie!

483
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:48,215
Water 7 has the best women!

484
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,283
Nothing like them
anywhere in the world!

485
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:51,485
Beautiful!

486
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:54,187
That's the real reason
you won't leave, you pervert!

487
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:57,224
[CHIMNEY]
Thanks for everything today,

488
00:20:57,258 --> 00:20:58,625
Mister Pirate Cook.

489
00:20:58,658 --> 00:20:59,793
I had a blast!

490
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:01,028
[GONBE]
Meow!

491
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,396
I'm the one who should
be grateful to you.

492
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,765
If you hadn't taken me
to that old man, I--

493
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,699
Huh?

494
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:07,568
Nothing. Nevermind, Chimney.

495
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,635
[CHIMNEY giggles]

496
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:10,637
We're gonna head on back
and meet up with Granny.

497
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,472
See you later!

498
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:13,240
Meow!

499
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:13,974
Okay!

500
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,009
Goodnight! Be careful!

501
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,447
[SANJI] Is that Usopp?

502
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:23,484
What's that? Really?

503
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:26,019
You want me to rejoin
your crew, do you?

504
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:27,054
Well, I understand.

505
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:28,656
It must be rough without me.

506
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:29,923
If I'm not around,

507
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:31,959
things really start to
fall apart, don't they?

508
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:33,293
Okay, then.

509
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:36,363
If you insist, I'll rejoin
the Straw Hat Pirates.

510
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:39,099
Yeah. That does seem to be
the best way to go about it.

511
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,668
Then that makes 23 scenarios.

512
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:42,769
Hey, Chopper!

513
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,438
Nice weather we're having, huh?

514
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,640
Let's go fishing!

515
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,042
Hey, Luffy! Care to join us?

516
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,077
Yeah, not bad.

517
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,211
And there's always the

518
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:52,312
"just pretend
like nothing happened

519
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:54,414
and hop onboard
the ship" strategy.

520
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:55,716
What else?

521
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:57,951
[USOPP] "I've decided to set
out on my own to visit Elbaf!"

522
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,520
"No! Please don't go!
We need you to stay!"

523
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:01,655
"I was just kidding!

524
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:02,923
I totally understand not
wanting to live your lives

525
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:04,158
without me."

526
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:07,994
"So, does that mean
you're staying, Usopp?"

527
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:10,297
Of course I will, dummies!

528
00:22:10,331 --> 00:22:12,133
Man, I didn't know
anybody could love someone

529
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,702
as much as you guys love me!

530
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:16,737
What the hell's he doing?

531
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,238
What an idiot.

532
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:21,808
[SANJI] And dinner is served!

533
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,543
[LUFFY] Whoa!

534
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,780
[LUFFY] It's even more
yummier than usual!

535
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,815
[CHOPPER] This flavor's amazing!

536
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:29,850
I'll say!

537
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:31,218
Delicious!

538
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:33,954
[LUFFY] Man!
This is super tasty!

539
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:35,455
Hey, Sanji?

540
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,056
[SANJI] Yeah?

541
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,091
Thank you so much!

542
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:38,726
This food is incredible!

543
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,427
Thank you, Sanji!

544
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:42,729
So... Who wants seconds?

545
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:44,297
Me! Fill 'er up, Eyebrows!

546
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:46,566
You can get more
food your damn self!

547
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,568
Over here!

548
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:48,702
Me, too!

549
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:49,770
[NAMI] Count me in!

550
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,038
[ROBIN] I'd like more, as well!

551
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:53,073
[SANJI] Coming right up!

552
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:58,211
[OLD COOK] Kid, the unknown
seas are waiting for you!

553
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,128
[ZAMBAI] Straw Hat!

554
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:17,297
We've got bad news!

555
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:19,099
Have you seen
the wanted posters?

556
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:19,900
[LUFFY] Whoa!

557
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:21,368
They're finally out?

558
00:23:21,402 --> 00:23:23,203
[ZAMBAI] You've got a huge
bounty on your head, Straw Hat!

559
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:25,139
The whole crew is wanted!

560
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:26,940
They're gonna
hunt you down for sure!

561
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,609
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

562
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:30,477
Everyone Finally Has A Bounty!

563
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,714
A Pirate Group
Worth Over 600 Million!

564
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:36,249
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
