1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,199
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:40,668
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:45,340
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:50,378
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:54,282
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:57,652
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,685 --> 00:03:00,088
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:03,525
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,494
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:09,764
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:11,566
[RYUMA] It'll be
just like before.

48
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,202
You talk big, but you'll end
up begging for your life

49
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,504
while screaming,
"Anything but the afro!

50
00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:18,406
Anything but the afro!"

51
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,643
[BROOK] Wrong!
This time is different!

52
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,779
Arrgh!

53
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:32,220
Nyohohoho...

54
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,289
[BROlOK] During
these past 5 years,

55
00:03:34,322 --> 00:03:37,492
I've been thinking of nothing
but this second chance.

56
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:41,129
And I've trained
to become stronger!

57
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,235
[LUFFY] "A Man's
Promise Never Dies!

58
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,071
To the Friend Waiting
Under the Distant Sky."

59
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:17,498
You said this thing's
bigger than a giant?

60
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:19,334
What is it, some
kind of monster?

61
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,636
Yeah, that huge
crash you heard

62
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:24,439
and all that crazy yelling
came from the same creature.

63
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:28,142
In other words, Luffy's
zombie is going on a rampage.

64
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,548
C'mon.

65
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:39,587
[USOPP] Hey, look!
I can see the Sunny!

66
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:41,889
Good.

67
00:04:41,923 --> 00:04:44,492
Then it looks like what that
Skeleton guy told us is right.

68
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:45,727
Indeed.

69
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,176
I see.

70
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,445
So that's the way
this works, huh?

71
00:05:05,613 --> 00:05:06,781
You land right
here on the island,

72
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:10,218
take a little stroll through
this gate and up the stairs.

73
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:11,185
And before you know it,

74
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:13,554
you've walked straight
into the boss' room.

75
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:17,792
Serving him your shadow
on a silver platter.

76
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:21,729
[panting heavily]

77
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:23,698
Somebody lowered
the stairs on the Sunny.

78
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:25,600
I wonder why they'd do that.

79
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:34,742
[USOPP]
Whooooooa!!

80
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:36,544
I don't know what happened
while we were gone,

81
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:39,447
but they totally
wrecked the place!

82
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,815
[ROBIN] This is
the zombies' work.

83
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:42,784
Their footprints are everywhere.

84
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:46,421
[CHOPPER] Huh? Then, you
think they're still here?

85
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:58,966
[USOPP] I wonder what
they were trying to do.

86
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,440
They tore through all our stuff.

87
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,474
Jokes on them.

88
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:08,242
We don't have
anything worth taking.

89
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:09,977
[sniff, sniff]

90
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,013
I don't smell
any zombies.

91
00:06:12,046 --> 00:06:13,748
[sniff, sniff]

92
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:16,451
So, you think the
others are really here?

93
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,519
Won't know 'til we look.

94
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:24,826
Hey! Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!

95
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:27,729
Are you here, or not, huh?

96
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,831
Answer us?

97
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:32,734
They probably placed
them inside a cabin, right?

98
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,969
Why would they do
something like that?

99
00:06:35,002 --> 00:06:37,038
They have to protect
Luffy and the others.

100
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:39,974
If they die, then their
zombies will die as well.

101
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:44,278
I see. Okay. Hey, Franky!

102
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:45,980
You and Chopper
check the first floor.

103
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:47,849
Robin and I will
check things upstairs.

104
00:06:47,882 --> 00:06:49,650
There may still be some
zombies hanging around here,

105
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:51,452
so everyone be careful, okay?

106
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:52,620
Okay.

107
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,942
Hey! Look! They're right
up here in the dining room!

108
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,911
All three of them!

109
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:24,852
Luffy!

110
00:07:27,722 --> 00:07:30,591
What the hell, is this?

111
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,697
Those zombies really
had a field day with them

112
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:38,633
while they were
knocked out, huh?

113
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:46,007
[ROBIN] It's hard to look at.

114
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:48,576
Wake up already!

115
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:51,913
This isn't the time to be
taking a nap, okay? C'mon!

116
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:57,451
[FRANKY] Leave this one to me.

117
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:00,521
[punching sounds]

118
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:01,689
[FRANKY] Get off
your asses, damn it!

119
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:02,857
We're in a lotta trouble here!

120
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,327
Take that crap off your face
and get with the program!

121
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:11,699
[USOPP] Still didn't do it, huh?

122
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:13,801
[FRANKY] So you punks
wanna be lazy, do ya?

123
00:08:13,835 --> 00:08:18,773
All right, then. Step aside.
I'm using my bazooka.

124
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:24,078
[USOPP] I have a more
delicate solution.

125
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:26,848
In times like these.

126
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:31,519
There's a beautiful
lady swordmaster

127
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,888
with a whole bunch of meat!

128
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:46,467
A lady?

129
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,068
With meat?

130
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:47,969
And swords?

131
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:50,905
You guys are hopeless!

132
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,462
Did you hear the news?

133
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,532
Indeed! It looks like
she's a 95, 55, 85!

134
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:19,367
Those three sizes...

135
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,169
...are nothing
short of a miracle!

136
00:09:40,388 --> 00:09:43,057
Ah, this's the one!

137
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,344
He he he! Perfect match!

138
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:06,080
Dearie, I'm gonna
make you shine!

139
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,302
Oh, almost forgot.

140
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:35,643
What the hell are you trying
to pull here, you old coot?

141
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:40,881
[chuckles] I'm saving
your necks, boys.

142
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:43,884
If Master Absalom found out
you were peeking at his bride,

143
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:46,420
you'd be even deader
than you are now.

144
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:49,423
Isn't that right,
Master Absalom?

145
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:55,629
[footsteps]

146
00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:57,631
Wait, don't tell me.

147
00:10:57,665 --> 00:11:00,167
He was still here?

148
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,406
Ahhh!!

149
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:07,875
No! Save me!

150
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:14,915
Damn it! I didn't
think he would find me.

151
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,756
Ahh! What're you waiting for?

152
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,858
Go invite the Zombie
Generals to the wedding!

153
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,659
Move! Get out of here!

154
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:26,861
[ZOMBIE PRIEST] Yes, sir!

155
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,805
That bastard!

156
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,607
Where's my shadow?

157
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,708
It ain't here, you idiot.

158
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,543
Take a look at where you are!

159
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,912
Uhhhn....

160
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,422
[LUFFY]
Huh? This is...

161
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:55,956
[FRANKY]
Yeah, the Sunny.

162
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,627
[ZORO] Wait, but what are we
doing back here all of a sudden?

163
00:12:00,628 --> 00:12:04,698
Ah crap, it wasn't a
dream after all, was it?

164
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:08,402
I really lost my shadow.
This feels weird.

165
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:12,440
You guys, this is an emergency.

166
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:15,476
Someone came in here and stole
all our food while we were out!

167
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:23,350
[LUFFY] Now I'm mad.

168
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,553
The guy with a
mouth full of grub

169
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:27,521
is complaining that
there's nothing to eat?

170
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:28,522
I'm mad too,

171
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:30,791
but at least they left
the dried food behind.

172
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:32,359
Who cares about that stuff?

173
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:35,563
I need meat! Bastards!

174
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,533
I screwed up.

175
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,570
How could I let that happen?

176
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:44,705
I really let my guard down.

177
00:12:44,738 --> 00:12:46,307
They took our lunchboxes--

178
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,908
there's nothing but cheese!

179
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:51,812
No fair! Why cheese?

180
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:53,280
So where's Nami?

181
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,583
Is she waiting
outside or something?

182
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:58,352
About that, uh...

183
00:12:58,686 --> 00:13:00,020
Uh...

184
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,693
You let some
bastard kidnap my angel?

185
00:13:05,726 --> 00:13:08,062
Why didn't you chase them
to ends of the world?

186
00:13:08,095 --> 00:13:09,730
It-it's not really
our fault, okay?

187
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:12,933
This particular guy is kind
of hard to catch, you see.

188
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,569
[SANJI] You tell me who he is
and where I can find him.

189
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:17,738
I'll hunt him down right now
and bring her back!

190
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:20,441
Wait, let me explain
the situation here,

191
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:21,976
it's sort of complicated.

192
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,411
[USOPP] Okay, so this
is the deal, you guys.

193
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:26,514
Even if it kills us,
we have two big things

194
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:28,682
we have to get back,
no matter what!

195
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:30,017
[LUFFY] Food and Nami.

196
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,919
Oh, and our shadows,
too, that's three.

197
00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:33,020
[USOPP] Okay, uh...

198
00:13:33,053 --> 00:13:35,756
I'm not sure if one of
those really makes the list.

199
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:36,824
Food is great and all,

200
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,560
but let's just focus on
Nami and shadows for now.

201
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:59,980
[SANJI] He, he's going.
To marry her?

202
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:04,051
No way in hell! Lemme at him!

203
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:05,519
Wow, this guy
must be pretty brave

204
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,087
if he wants to marry Nami!

205
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:09,456
And what's all this
about me being a monster?

206
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,926
Why does my shadow get
to do all the cool stuff?

207
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:13,994
So Usopp, you guys
already saw who,

208
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:16,730
or what, has Sanji and
Luffy's shadows, right?

209
00:14:16,764 --> 00:14:18,599
No one told me
we were fighting

210
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:20,601
one of the Seven
Warlords of the Sea.

211
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:23,637
[CHOPPER] Can I just hide in
a hole and cry myself to sleep?

212
00:14:23,671 --> 00:14:25,906
[FRANKY] You guys were all
business just a second ago.

213
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,108
[USOPP and CHOPPER]
We didn't know any better!

214
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:30,344
[USOPP]
Oh wait, I almost forgot.

215
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:32,046
Hey, wait a sec.

216
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,948
if you put someone's
shadow in a zombie,

217
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:35,683
then they act like
that person, right?

218
00:14:35,716 --> 00:14:38,118
Then, I think I've seen
your Zombie, Zoro.

219
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:41,555
Oh yeah?
What kinda guy was he?

220
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,791
Well, he looked
just like you.

221
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,862
Scars on the back are the
shame of a swordsman, but...

222
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:53,033
...I've got scars
on my entire body!

223
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,702
But since he was
wearing wooden clogs,

224
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:56,804
I could tell it wasn't you.

225
00:14:56,837 --> 00:14:58,572
All right, whatever
you say then.

226
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,742
So if we find this guy with the
clogs, the dog penguin thing,

227
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,043
the one that has Sanji's shadow,

228
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:04,712
and Luffy's giant
monster zombie,

229
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:06,847
all we gotta do is throw
some salt in their mouths

230
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,616
and then we'll get
our shadows back?

231
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:09,583
Is that it?

232
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,785
[FRANKY] Uh-huh, that's
what it looks like.

233
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:21,762
[ZORO] Nice job on figuring
out their weakness,

234
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,063
how'd you pull that one off?

235
00:15:23,097 --> 00:15:25,099
[FRANKY] Save your thanks
for the afro skeleton,

236
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,934
not only did he know
how to beat the zombies,

237
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,503
he also told us you'd be
waiting back here at the Sunny.

238
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:33,073
What? You ran into Brook again?

239
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:35,175
[FRANKY] Yeah, though
I feel a little bad,

240
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:37,711
since I asked him a
pretty cruel question.

241
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,714
[FRANKY] Even though you
wanted him to join the crew,

242
00:15:40,748 --> 00:15:43,617
when I met the guy,
I didn't give him a fair shake.

243
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,454
Truth be told, I barely
even thought of him as human.

244
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,956
But once I actually
took the time

245
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,824
to talk to him for a second.

246
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:53,193
I found out he has
a real backbone.

247
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:56,497
Other than the obvious, I mean.

248
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,223
[FRANKY] What I'm saying is...

249
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:12,162
I was wrong.
That skeleton's a real man.

250
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:22,106
I,.. I shouldn't
have said it, but...

251
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:33,751
I'm in a hurry,
so please excuse me.

252
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,452
I'll be on my way now.

253
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:38,255
Hold on a second!

254
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,790
While you're still
in a mood to talk,

255
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:41,525
there's one more
burning question

256
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:43,761
I still need an answer to.

257
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,296
If you go out in
public looking like that.

258
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,300
You know how people are
gonna react, don't you?

259
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:52,403
I mean, you're
a talking skeleton.

260
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:54,204
There's no way someone
as creepy as you

261
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:56,340
is ever gonna make
friends with anyone.

262
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:58,308
People're gonna
run away in terror.

263
00:16:58,342 --> 00:17:01,145
Franky, why are you
telling him that?

264
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,347
[FRANKY] Even if you
could see the sun

265
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,616
and make it out of
these cursed waters,

266
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,085
your life would still
be full of suffering.

267
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,089
[FRANKY] You've had it rough
for a long time already.

268
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:14,758
Are you sure you
could handle that?

269
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:16,193
After all, you said
before that you were

270
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:19,696
so lonely that you
wanted to die, right?

271
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,697
If I were you,

272
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:24,068
I would've given up on
life a long time ago.

273
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:26,470
And yet you still
act like a gentleman.

274
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,439
You laugh. You sing.

275
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:31,208
You pretend like you don't
have a care in the world.

276
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:33,377
What is it that's
keeping you alive?

277
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,479
You said you made a
promise to a friend?

278
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,715
What is it? How could
it be so important?

279
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,088
Yohoho...
Interested in me, are you?

280
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:47,858
[BROOK] The story
is quite simple.

281
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:50,761
At a certain point in the past,
before we came to these waters,

282
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:53,730
my crew left behind
a good friend of ours.

283
00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:57,234
It was a troubling situation,
but we did it out of necessity.

284
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:58,435
The only consolation
we could offer

285
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,871
this friend was a promise
that we would return one day,

286
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:02,172
no matter the cost.

287
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,641
But then the crew
was annihilated.

288
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:08,178
And the promise that we
made was left unfulfilled.

289
00:18:09,313 --> 00:18:11,115
[BROOK] Since
I am the only survivor,

290
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:13,350
it is my duty to
return to our friend,

291
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,120
even if I must bear sad news.

292
00:18:16,153 --> 00:18:19,223
How long has it been
since the day we died?

293
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:23,260
I've lost count, but it's
been more than 50 years now.

294
00:18:23,293 --> 00:18:24,728
50 years?

295
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:26,430
You're talking ages ago, here!

296
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:28,799
Hell, I wasn't even born yet!

297
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:30,400
I hate to break
it to you buddy,

298
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:32,569
but there's no way your
friend's still waiting for you.

299
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:34,538
You don't know that!

300
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:39,176
[BROOK] But it's
true that he would

301
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:40,344
have every right
to leave by now.

302
00:18:40,377 --> 00:18:43,881
I realize I may be foolish
to believe he's still there.

303
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,551
However, if by some chance,

304
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,686
he did believe in our
promise and is waiting

305
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,322
for us even after
all of these years.

306
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:53,891
Then the loneliness
he's suffering,

307
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,727
would be far worse than my own.

308
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,164
How sad must he be,
wondering if we betrayed him,

309
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:02,866
wondering if our
promise was a lie.

310
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,903
Yet still waiting for
us in the same place.

311
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:08,438
You're right, but...

312
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,476
[BROOK] The name of that friend
that we left at the cape,

313
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:14,511
swearing to meet again, is...

314
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:16,313
...Laboon.

315
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,448
He was just a child.

316
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:20,384
We simply couldn't
take such a young whale

317
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,319
on a dangerous
journey like that.

318
00:19:22,352 --> 00:19:24,321
A whale?

319
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:26,757
Yes.

320
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,197
[RUMBAR PIRATES]
Goodbye Laboon!

321
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,264
I'm sorry we have to leave you!

322
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,401
Don't worry, we'll be
back soon! Be a good boy!

323
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:42,506
[whale cry]

324
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,510
[BROOK] I can only imagine
how big he's grown since then.

325
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,280
[FRANKY] You think that whale,
understood your promise?

326
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,449
In his own way.

327
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,418
I can't help but think
that he's still waiting

328
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:58,722
for us at that cape, staring
longingly at the Grand Line.

329
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:00,691
[BROOK] He probably
wants to hear us

330
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:03,460
play our cheerful music again.

331
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,962
Dancing and singing.

332
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:09,333
Although I suppose it's
a bit late for that now.

333
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,435
[BROOK] Even if
I am able to return,

334
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:13,303
I don't think he'll
forgive us for running away

335
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,906
and dying like that.

336
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:17,774
But no matter how
much he resents me

337
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:20,677
for forcing him to
suffer all of these years.

338
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:25,949
[BROOK]
Death is never an apology.

339
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,720
Because when a
man makes a promise,

340
00:20:29,753 --> 00:20:32,856
he doesn't stop fighting
until he fulfills it!

341
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:42,532
[FRANKY] So there you have it,
that's it the whole story.

342
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:44,334
Laboon.

343
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:52,709
[chuckles]

344
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:59,549
[whale roar]

345
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:08,258
This is crazy,
what're the chances?

346
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:10,560
I'll be damned.

347
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:13,864
Hm? Hm?

348
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:23,473
Oh, right. Chopper and
Robin weren't with us then.

349
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:29,680
[whale roar]

350
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:40,023
[whale roar]

351
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:42,359
[LUFFY] You! You think
you can break my special seat

352
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:44,294
and get away with it?

353
00:21:45,562 --> 00:21:48,699
[roars]

354
00:22:10,854 --> 00:22:12,656
I'm stronger than I look!

355
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,927
[LUFFY] I can always tell when
someone's itching to fight.

356
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,397
Well, if you want a battle,
I'll gladly give ya one.

357
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,399
Your shipmates used to
spar with you didn't they?

358
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:23,400
You miss it.

359
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:26,670
Well, I can rival
anything they threw at ya!

360
00:22:26,703 --> 00:22:29,005
[LUFFY] Tell ya what, after
me and my friends travel

361
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,375
the Grand Line, we'll
come back and find you.

362
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:34,077
And then you better
be ready for a rematch!

363
00:22:34,578 --> 00:22:36,546
Hey, not bad!

364
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,115
Consider this a
symbol of my promise

365
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,384
to come do battle with you!

366
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:41,852
Of course, it's
a rush paint job,

367
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:44,154
so you'll have to be careful
and avoid hitting your head

368
00:22:44,187 --> 00:22:46,423
or you'll rub it
right off. Understand?

369
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:50,961
[roars]

370
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:53,663
We've met that
whale before.

371
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:02,539
And we know that promise.

372
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:08,745
[roars]

373
00:23:17,954 --> 00:23:20,824
[ZORO] So Laboon's been waiting
at that cape all this time.

374
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:21,958
[USOPP] Even after 50 years,

375
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:23,860
he's still thinking
of his friends.

376
00:23:23,894 --> 00:23:26,563
I thought that whale's story
was crazy enough already,

377
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:28,565
but this is almost
too much to swallow!

378
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:30,700
[ZORO] And that skeleton
is a swordsman, huh?

379
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:32,068
Now I'm getting interested.

380
00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:33,703
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

381
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:35,205
"I Swear to Go See Him!

382
00:23:35,238 --> 00:23:37,574
Brook and the Cape of Promise!"

383
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:39,843
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
