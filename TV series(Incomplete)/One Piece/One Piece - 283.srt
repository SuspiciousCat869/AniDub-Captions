1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,304
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,739
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,508
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,811
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,279
You want my treasure?

6
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:13,380
You can have it!

7
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,383
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,586
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,657
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,126
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:29,362
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,348
Those fools braved
Aqua Laguna to get here.

13
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,383
They're determined,
if nothing else.

14
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,217
Humph.

15
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,785
Either that,
or they're just lucky.

16
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,455
Remember, we have
permission to kill this time.

17
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:38,225
But if we kill them, it'll be
over before we have any fun.

18
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,426
The drawbridge?

19
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,060
Yeah.

20
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:40,927
The Franky Family's trying

21
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,063
to get that under
control right now.

22
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,264
Once they bring it down,

23
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,534
we should be able to get to
the other side, no problem.

24
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,535
What a pain.

25
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,037
She's right there and
all we can do is wait.

26
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,350
CP9.

27
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:10,291
I tried to leave
everything behind.

28
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,627
The last thing I wanted
was for you to come after me.

29
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,731
Why did you do it?

30
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,614
But for now, I want to
talk about Nico Robin.

31
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:34,882
What do you know?

32
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:39,420
When you first came to Water 7,
did she start acting strangely?

33
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,121
Yeah. She did.

34
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,325
She went into town that day
and then never came back.

35
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,459
By the next morning,

36
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:49,596
she was the prime suspect
in your attempted murder.

37
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,733
When Sanji and Chopper
finally saw her again,

38
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,668
she said this was goodbye

39
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,171
and wouldn't be a part
of the crew anymore.

40
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,240
Of course, none of that
made any sense to us,

41
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,542
so, we decided to
break into your mansion,

42
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,744
in hopes that we'd be able
to see her one more time

43
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,278
and find out the truth.

44
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,149
I did it to make
my wish come true.

45
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,552
One that can't happen
as long as we're together.

46
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,520
If you can't accept
that, I'm sorry.

47
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,757
What kind of wish
would force her

48
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,625
to give up all
of her friends?

49
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,363
I think I know the
answer, actually.

50
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,370
This probably started
shortly after you lost sight

51
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,538
of her for the first time.

52
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,441
CP9.

53
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,342
The government had begun

54
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,144
its operation the
moment she arrived.

55
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,782
In other words,
there's a good reason

56
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,218
why your friend
did what she did.

57
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,453
But before I go
into the details,

58
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,589
I want you to understand
that both Nico Robin

59
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,158
and I have the means to
revive an ancient weapon

60
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,194
that is capable of
destroying the entire world.

61
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,330
A weapon?

62
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,530
That's right.

63
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:01,202
Click.

64
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,737
It's me. We've hit
a snag in the plan.

65
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,040
Everyone head to the
bedroom immediately.

66
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,377
Don't shoot Iceberg yet.

67
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,081
Do you understand now?

68
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:17,717
The blueprints that
they found are fake!

69
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,654
I don't care.

70
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:23,190
I would rather die than
hand over that information

71
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,692
to the government.

72
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,493
But now it's not that simple.

73
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,596
If you've decided that
you're going to help them,

74
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,265
and you're searching for
the Poneglyphs yourself,

75
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,733
then I have to do everything
I can to stop you!

76
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,171
I understand your concern,

77
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,173
but I'm only studying the
Poneglyphs to learn more

78
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,041
about the history of the world.

79
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,543
I don't care about the weapon.

80
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,746
You have to take responsibility!

81
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,651
I told you this would happen.

82
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,487
But you don't listen.

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,258
Franky, even if
you weren't trying to.

84
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,427
Weapons are made to hurt people.

85
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:05,666
Whether you want them to or not,
they can hurt your friends.

86
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,035
Even if you don't
have malicious intent,

87
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,537
your actions can
still hurt people!

88
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,239
If your curiosity
for history leads

89
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:15,075
to the destruction of the world,
then you're better off

90
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,511
dying right here and
right now, Nico Robin!

91
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,314
Even after seeing what happened

92
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,784
to the devils of Ohara, you
still want to walk this path?

93
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,289
You don't know a
damned thing about Ohara!

94
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,528
You have no idea how
much the World Government

95
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,430
has warped my life,
do you hear me?

96
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:44,538
If you hate the government
so much, then why help them?

97
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,346
Because I have a wish that
I would sacrifice anything for.

98
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,589
When I came to this town,

99
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,525
CP-9 presented me
with two conditions.

100
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,594
The first was to
pin your assassination

101
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:09,296
on the Straw Hats
and leave their crew.

102
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:13,400
The second was to turn
myself over to the government

103
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,269
and follow their every
order without question.

104
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,373
You realize, they
won't let you live.

105
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,308
You escaped them for 20 years.

106
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,044
Why would you agree to
something like that now?

107
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,548
In this particular instance,

108
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,416
CP9 has been given permission

109
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,820
to activate a Buster Call
against the Straw Hats.

110
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,322
A Buster Call?

111
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,425
It's an emergency order that
summons five vice admirals

112
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,461
and ten battleships
to the same location.

113
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,732
No matter how strong you are,

114
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:48,468
no one can survive a full-scale
military attack of that caliber.

115
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:52,439
Under normal circumstances,
only the three admirals

116
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,675
and the head of the navy,
the fleet admiral,

117
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,578
are allowed to exercise
that kind of authority.

118
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:01,148
However, this is a special case.

119
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:04,151
Just this once,
Admiral Aokiji has given

120
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,453
CP-9 the right to make the call.

121
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,290
When I heard his name,
I surrendered.

122
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,792
If I hadn't agreed to their
conditions, then me and the rest

123
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,428
of the Straw Hats
would've been annihilated.

124
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:17,731
For the past 20 years, I've been
able to run away and survive,

125
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,301
no matter what the circumstance,

126
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,337
but that's only because
I had nothing to protect.

127
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,041
Because I was willing to betray
others and use them as a shield.

128
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,242
But not now.

129
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:32,546
For the first time in all
these years, I can't do that.

130
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,184
They picked up the
life I gave up on.

131
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,620
Returned the heart I lost.

132
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:43,256
And continued the dreams
that I no longer believed in.

133
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,427
Even after all I've done,

134
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,696
I've found friends who
will still believe in me.

135
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,733
I see, but then
what is your wish?

136
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,273
That excluding me, all of
the other Straw Hat pirates

137
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:02,509
will be allowed to
leave this island safely!

138
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,314
And as long as you can
have that, you don't care about

139
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,683
what happens to
the rest of the world?

140
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:11,785
I don't.

141
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,085
Luffy!

142
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,461
You idiot!

143
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,464
What the hell are
you doing up there?

144
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:04,070
Nami? Where are you?
I can't see!

145
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,741
Okay, listen, listen,
it's not my fault.

146
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,643
That pigeon guy sent me flying

147
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,746
and I got stuck between these
buildings, so I can't move.

148
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,548
I'm trying, though!

149
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:29,296
Is this a joke to you?
We don't have time for this!

150
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,832
Those guys from the
government took Robin away

151
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,067
and you weren't
even there to help!

152
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,774
She did it all for us, you know!

153
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,476
She's going to
sacrifice herself!

154
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,495
The government was planning
an on attack on us,

155
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:05,665
but Robin turned herself over
to CP9 so we would be safe!

156
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:12,739
She knew they would kill her,
but she didn't care!

157
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:21,448
Then, Robin was
lying this whole time?

158
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,089
I'm glad.

159
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:47,641
Whoa-hoa! Awesome!
Check out the face!

160
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,512
That's so cool!

161
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:55,082
Unlike the Puffing Tom,
this one here's a crazy train.

162
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,252
Its name is "Rocketman."

163
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:01,555
Comes with no guarantees,
so board at your own risk.

164
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,224
Good! Now, let's take off!

165
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:36,724
Now Departing Water
Seven for Enies Lobby!

166
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,426
Here comes Rocketman!

167
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,633
Yeah! Full speed!

168
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,574
Let's go! We'll get it all back!

169
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:16,429
Cool!

170
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,392
Take this!

171
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:57,171
Every man and every nation in
the world must answer to me!

172
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,407
All that power at
the tip of my fingers!

173
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,442
I don't understand.

174
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:05,579
Why would Aokiji allow you
to invoke the Buster Call?

175
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:31,438
What gives you any
right to question me?

176
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,373
You shut your mouth!

177
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:37,144
You get to play a part in
the rebirth of this world!

178
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:40,680
Isn't that enough for you,
you insolent witch?

179
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:45,252
Why, you should
even be thanking me!

180
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,553
Yeah? Huh?

181
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,724
I'll cleanse this world
of Ohara's legacy

182
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,525
by bleeding you dry.

183
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:55,061
Nico Robin.

184
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,431
Hurry!

185
00:14:57,464 --> 00:15:00,033
Run to the evacuation ship!

186
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,138
Save those books!

187
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,172
Someone take these!

188
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,675
We weren't trying to
uncover some dark secret.

189
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,443
We simply wanted
to hear the voices

190
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,478
of the past and protect them.

191
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,647
Stop it! I wanna stay with you!

192
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,384
Mommy! No!

193
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:22,322
You must live, Robin!

194
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,673
Now you listen to me.

195
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:42,409
You may be lonely at first.

196
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,413
But one day you'll
find true friends.

197
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,217
True friends?

198
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,084
Yeah.

199
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:54,788
The sea's a vast place,
so I guarantee.

200
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:59,460
Someday you'll find friends
who won't ever leave you!

201
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:00,527
Monster!

202
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,762
Monster!

203
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,798
She's so scary her mom ran away!

204
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:08,736
No matter who you are,

205
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:12,239
ain't no one born into
this world to be alone!

206
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:18,044
Someday, you'll know.

207
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:23,550
They said she's one
of the devils of Ohara.

208
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,319
You know, those scholars who
were plotting to end the world?

209
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,088
Don't let her get away!

210
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,590
Now, give me my money!

211
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:32,158
I told you where
she was hiding, didn't I?

212
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,096
A devil like you
shouldn't even exist!

213
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,036
Your friends are out there
at sea waiting for you, Robin.

214
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,104
All you gotta do is find them!

215
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:10,831
Sniper King.

216
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,067
Hm?

217
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,569
Shoot down that flag.

218
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,003
Roger.

219
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:23,077
This my new weapon, a massive
slingshot by the name of Kabuto!

220
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,246
Behold its awesome power!

221
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,682
Special Attack Firebird Star!

222
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:38,758
No way!

223
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,163
Mission complete.

224
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,599
You're all going to die!

225
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:49,503
You morons can't challenge the
entire world and expect to win!

226
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:54,507
Yeah? Bring it on!

227
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:08,555
Robin! There's still
something I wanna hear you say!

228
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:15,729
Tell me you wanna live!

229
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:18,565
I can live?

230
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,066
Face it!

231
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,703
Your whole existence
is nothing but a crime!

232
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:24,738
The whole world's
against you Robin!

233
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,340
You can't be allowed to live!

234
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:32,145
I never dared to wish
for something like that.

235
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:37,517
The world had
denied me that hope.

236
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:42,356
The sea's a vast place,
so, I guarantee.

237
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,692
Someday you'll find friends
who won't ever leave you!

238
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:52,399
But now.

239
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:56,469
If I'm allowed to say
my wish, just this once.

240
00:18:58,105 --> 00:18:59,706
Then I--

241
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:05,579
I want to live!
Take me with you!

242
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,248
Take me away from here!

243
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,202
Let's go!

244
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,543
All right, move it!

245
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:40,580
As long as I've got CP9 here,
I'm practically invincible!

246
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,326
What? What the hell is it?

247
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,667
Let's go!

248
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,197
The reason she's
wearing sunglasses is

249
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,233
because anything she
looks at will turn to stone.

250
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,502
Such is the life of a Gorgon.

251
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:38,439
But on this particular
day, Rodusa has

252
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:41,641
an entirely different reason
for not looking at anyone.

253
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,444
Found you, monster!

254
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,282
All right, Dragon.

255
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,117
Hand over your legendary horns.

256
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,353
Oh, give it up already!
That hurts!

257
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:54,788
And anyway, who are
you calling a monster?

258
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:58,058
C'mon, help me fish instead.

259
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,661
There's supposed to be a
legendary fish in these waters.

260
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,564
This is what life is like in
the carefree monster village

261
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,566
found inside Monster Forest.

262
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,068
Its name, is Monstown.

263
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,502
Looks like you gotta bite!

264
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,577
I can't believe I fell
for that delicious bait!

265
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,479
Come on! You again, Choppaken?

266
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:21,715
What were you doing at the
bottom of the ocean, anyway?

267
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,584
I was looking for
the legendary treasure

268
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,653
that's supposed to be
down there somewhere.

269
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:28,188
Anyway, think you could give
me some more of that bait?

270
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:32,593
Hold it, Choppaken!

271
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:36,596
Don't put one single tentacle on
that legendary treasure, got it?

272
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,600
If I grab it first,
it's finders keepers, right?

273
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,802
Of all the nerve!
You wanna fight about it?

274
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,136
Scary.

275
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:49,243
Is one of you slimy bastards
giving my Stronami a hard time?

276
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:50,710
Cause I'll crush you!

277
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:56,550
Hey. Why the hell are
you trying to catch me?

278
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,085
You're the legendary fish.

279
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:00,120
I'm a kappa, dammit! Not a fish!

280
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,123
Yeah, a perverted kappa
that lives under the sea.

281
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,458
Now prepare yourself!

282
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,360
Says the minotaur
that looks like a cow.

283
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:07,528
Nice spots, tough guy.

284
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:08,596
Shut your hole!

285
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:09,597
And while I'm here,
I'll be taking

286
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,832
that legendary saucer
you got on your head.

287
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:13,367
No way, Bessie.

288
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,635
This thing keeps me alive.

289
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:17,171
But since we're talking
about legendary things,

290
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:19,473
those iron clubs you've
got are just what I need.

291
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:20,574
Just try to take 'em!

292
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,009
Stop it! That's enough!
All of you!

293
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,778
Legendary this, legendary that.

294
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:25,478
Don't you get it?

295
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,215
You're all legendary creatures!

296
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:30,283
Wait a minute, Rodusa!

297
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:32,786
We're only looking because
we all saw you crying

298
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,122
when you lost your
legendary earrings earlier

299
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:37,458
and wanted to help you
find something even rarer!

300
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:38,558
Hey! That was a secret!

301
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:44,164
And so the reason she
wouldn't look at her friends,

302
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,700
was not because
she was a Gorgon,

303
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:49,736
but because she was
hiding her tears of joy.

304
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:56,409
Oh, you guys. Thank you!

305
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:05,285
Such is life in Monstown,
the carefree monster village.
