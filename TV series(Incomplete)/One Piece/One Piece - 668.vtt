learn all the secrets they held.

an alliance with Law.

Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.612 --> 00:03:27.414
Luffy had intended
to win a tournament

00:03:27.447 --> 00:03:29.720
that promised the Flame Flame
Fruit to the champion,

00:03:29.753 --> 00:03:33.226
but abandoned that plan when Law
was captured by Doflamingo.

Meanwhile, at the coliseum,
the final battle of the

I'm going to cause a bit of
commotion here shortly,

So better surrender to us now!

00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:08.497
Huh? Why's the Navy interfering?

00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:11.770
What's that?
Did I just miss some-theen?

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:13.907
[FUJITORA] Now I may be
a newcomer to this game,

recruited through
the World Military Draft,

00:04:16.546 --> 00:04:20.086
but since I was appointed to
the position of Navy Admiral,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.160
I've got but a
simple goal in mind.

captured the crowd's heart!

00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:57.447

It's Jesus Burgess!

the prize home today,

They must avoid the wrath
of the deadly fighting fish,

00:15:13.626 --> 00:15:15.931
and scramble to
snag the treasure!

00:15:15.964 --> 00:15:18.536
Who among these fighters
will lay claim

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.541
to the Flame Flame Fruit?

00:15:20.574 --> 00:15:26.719
And now, let the battle begin!

00:15:59.686 --> 00:16:02.958
[GYATS] The tension is so thick,
you could cut it with a knife!

00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:06.331
One wrong move could send
them hurtling to their doom!

00:16:06.364 --> 00:16:09.037
Any of these fighters
could take home the prize,

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:13.212
but the rest will be
leaving in tears, if at all!

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.688
[GYATS]
They're sizing each other up.

00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:20.560
Who is gonna make
the first move?

00:16:22.163 --> 00:16:23.499
[BURGESS laughing]

00:16:23.533 --> 00:16:26.840
[GYATS] It's Burgess! And he's
flying straight at Lucy!

00:16:26.873 --> 00:16:29.912
[BURGESS grunting, laughing]

00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:39.699
[GYATS] He dodges deftly and
dashes to the outer circle

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:43.305
of the ring! What plan
is he cooking up?

00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:44.942
Huh?

00:16:51.722 --> 00:16:53.458
[SABO]
Here it comes.

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:07.219
Not that one.

00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:14.133
Yo. If you ain't got the
treasure, then buzz off.

00:17:16.037 --> 00:17:18.075
[BARTOLOMEO]
And don't come back!

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.279
[BURGESS] Trying to lure out the
one with the prize, Straw Hat?

00:17:20.312 --> 00:17:21.882
That's clever!

00:17:30.233 --> 00:17:32.437
This one is a dud, too.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.009
[BURGESS laughing]

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:50.106
Oh, yeah. I gotta admit,
this is fun as hell!

00:17:50.139 --> 00:17:51.475
Of course it is!

00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:53.813
'Cause I'm the one
running the show!

00:17:53.846 --> 00:17:55.483
Here in the Corrida Coliseum,

00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:57.420
I use every tool at my disposal

00:17:57.453 --> 00:17:59.290
to give the audience
the time of their lives!

00:17:59.324 --> 00:18:02.430
Do those "tools"
include us, too?

00:18:02.464 --> 00:18:05.436
Well, just have fun.

00:18:33.292 --> 00:18:36.131
[KIN'EMON] It would seem
that no one is present.

00:18:38.636 --> 00:18:40.841
[LUFFY]
Nice. Let's go.

00:18:40.874 --> 00:18:42.243
[VIOLET]
Hold on a second!

00:18:44.214 --> 00:18:46.351
[VIOLET]
Close the door first.

00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:57.574
[LUFFY]
Huh...?

00:18:59.646 --> 00:19:02.049
[LUFFY] Is that how you
get inside the palace?

00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:04.789
[VIOLET]
Shhh!

00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:08.863
The palace is above us.
That's the Rampart Tower.

00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:10.399
Oh.

00:19:10.432 --> 00:19:12.236
[VIOLET] There's actually quite
a bit of climbing left to do

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.746
before we reach Doflamingo.
And it's well-guarded, too.

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:19.351
Thankfully, the Rampart Tower
has a secret entrance.

00:19:19.384 --> 00:19:23.993
Let's go, but take care not
to let the guards notice you.

00:19:24.026 --> 00:19:26.498
They'll call the Executives
if we make a scene.

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:30.874
That won't be good. Especially
if we have to battle with Pica.

00:19:30.907 --> 00:19:34.013
Then any hope of
success would be lost.

00:19:35.249 --> 00:19:37.220
[KIN'EMON]
Hm, where is Sir Luffy?

00:19:37.254 --> 00:19:38.757
Uh-oh. Right there!

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.025
[VIOLET gasps]

00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:45.904
[LUFFY yelling]

00:19:45.937 --> 00:19:47.239
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Eh?

00:19:49.912 --> 00:19:52.884
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Whoa! What's up with that carp?

00:19:53.886 --> 00:19:56.592
Now, Gum-Gum...

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:02.036
Maybe it's actually a blowfish?

00:20:02.069 --> 00:20:02.838
That's freaky!

00:20:02.871 --> 00:20:05.109
...Giant Pistol!

00:20:16.297 --> 00:20:18.335
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES screaming]

00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:24.715
[KIN'EMON gasping]

00:20:24.748 --> 00:20:25.984
[ZORO gasps]

00:20:27.153 --> 00:20:28.155
[VIOLET whimpering]

00:20:28.188 --> 00:20:31.695
[ZORO, KIN'EMON]
What the hell is he doing?!

00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:42.216
[LUFFY]
It's open!

00:20:42.249 --> 00:20:44.321
[ZORO]
That's not the issue here!

00:20:44.354 --> 00:20:45.724
This is not good.

00:20:45.757 --> 00:20:47.427
Ah! You big blockhead!

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.299
Well, new plan. We're going in!

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:52.470
If we hurry, we might get lucky!

00:20:52.504 --> 00:20:54.407
[LUFFY]
Can I take this thing off now?

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.777
[VIOLET]
Not like I could stop you!

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.014
[KIN'EMON]
Now, now!

00:21:02.725 --> 00:21:05.095
Straw Hat?

00:21:05.128 --> 00:21:09.572
[alarm blaring]

00:21:09.605 --> 00:21:11.075
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
This is the front entrance

00:21:11.108 --> 00:21:12.611
to the Rampart Tower!

00:21:12.644 --> 00:21:17.754
Emergency! Straw Hat
Luffy has broken in!

00:21:17.788 --> 00:21:18.990
[DOFLAMINGO grunts]

00:21:19.023 --> 00:21:22.163
[CROWD cheering]

00:21:22.564 --> 00:21:24.367
[GYATS]
The Fighting Fish attacks,

00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:29.545
but Lucy leaps aside with ease!
Nobody else has moves like that!

00:21:29.578 --> 00:21:34.922
Huh...? What the hell
is going on here?

00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:42.804
You're sure it was
Straw Hat Luffy?

00:21:42.838 --> 00:21:44.307
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
Yeah! He smashed the gate in

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.476
with one punch!

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.446
I think you should get
your eyes checked.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.518
Straw Hat's fighting
in the coliseum.

00:21:49.551 --> 00:21:51.722
He's in disguise,
but it's sloppy.

00:21:51.755 --> 00:21:56.264
[CROWD cheering]

00:22:01.007 --> 00:22:03.212
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE F] This is
Rampart Tower, B-2, in front of

00:22:03.245 --> 00:22:06.251
the main dining hall!
I've confirmed it myself!

00:22:06.284 --> 00:22:09.524
Straw Hat Luffy
is one of the intruders!

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:15.704
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE F]
He's with Pirate Hunter Zoro!

00:22:15.737 --> 00:22:20.379
And wait... Lady Violet!

00:22:20.412 --> 00:22:22.818
There's another swordsman, too!

00:22:22.851 --> 00:22:25.823
Ahhh!

00:22:25.857 --> 00:22:29.096
[GYATS]
Lucy is really showing off!

00:22:33.372 --> 00:22:37.247
[DOFLAMINGO] Straw Hat Luffy
broke into the tower?

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.317
And he's here right now?

00:22:41.956 --> 00:22:45.396
[DOFLAMINGO]
Then who the hell is that idiot

00:22:45.429 --> 00:22:48.368
with the stupid disguise
fighting in the coliseum?

00:22:48.402 --> 00:22:51.207
Can somebody tell me
what's going on?

00:23:02.897 --> 00:23:05.570
[LUFFY]
I'm comin' for you, Mingo!

00:23:14.353 --> 00:23:16.324
[NARRATOR] Luffy and
friends continue to make

00:23:16.357 --> 00:23:17.761
quick progress in their mission,

00:23:17.795 --> 00:23:21.401
until they run into a massive
wall in the form of Pica.

00:23:21.435 --> 00:23:23.438
With the power to control
the palace itself,

00:23:23.472 --> 00:23:26.044
the final Don Quixote
family executive proves

00:23:26.078 --> 00:23:27.914
that he won't be
an easy obstacle

00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:29.885
for the team to overcome!

00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:31.589
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.622 --> 00:23:36.064
"A Moving Castle! The Top
Executive Pica Rises Up!"

00:23:36.097 --> 00:23:38.368
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
