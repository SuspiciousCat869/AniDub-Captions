WEBVTT

00:01:28.176 --> 00:01:30.180
[cackles]

00:01:30.213 --> 00:01:34.255
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:35.992
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:38.196
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.939
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.082
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:40.922
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:46.065
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:48.671
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:52.044
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.077 --> 00:02:53.881
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.086
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.058
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.595 --> 00:03:03.099
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.132 --> 00:03:04.936
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.710
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.744 --> 00:03:13.052
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.527
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.296
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.601
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:23.239
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.272 --> 00:03:25.578
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.612 --> 00:03:27.414
Luffy had intended
to win a tournament

00:03:27.447 --> 00:03:29.720
that promised the Flame Flame
Fruit to the champion,

00:03:29.753 --> 00:03:33.226
but abandoned that plan when Law
was captured by Doflamingo.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.099
Meanwhile, at the coliseum,
the final battle of the

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:39.304
tournament is about to start--
with Sabo in Luffy's place.

00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:42.144
[SABO] I'm actually rather
familiar with your backstory.

00:03:42.177 --> 00:03:45.216
Then you know about my family?

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.456
I'm going to cause a bit of
commotion here shortly,

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.228
but I swear won't do you wrong.

00:03:51.262 --> 00:03:54.268
Launcher!

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.706
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES screaming]

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.209
[FRANKY]
Huh?!

00:03:58.243 --> 00:04:02.284
[MARINE OFFICER A] Cyborg Franky
of the Straw Hat Pirates!

00:04:02.317 --> 00:04:04.221
We'll be seizing the Toy House!

00:04:04.254 --> 00:04:05.958
So better surrender to us now!

00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:08.497
Huh? Why's the Navy interfering?

00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:11.770
What's that?
Did I just miss some-theen?

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:13.907
[FUJITORA] Now I may be
a newcomer to this game,

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:16.513
recruited through
the World Military Draft,

00:04:16.546 --> 00:04:20.086
but since I was appointed to
the position of Navy Admiral,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.160
I've got but a
simple goal in mind.

00:04:23.193 --> 00:04:25.163
And that is?

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:27.635
[FUJITORA]
I won't stop

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.307
till I bear witness to
the complete abolition

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.981
of this accursed
Seven Warlords system.

00:04:36.118 --> 00:04:37.254
[FUJITORA]
The price on your head

00:04:37.288 --> 00:04:40.160
will only increase,
Heavenly Demon.

00:04:40.193 --> 00:04:42.632
[laughs] Did I mishear you?

00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:46.338
I though you said, "Off me now
while you have the chance!"

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:48.644
I got it.

00:04:48.677 --> 00:04:49.311
[VIOLET gasps]

00:04:49.344 --> 00:04:52.184
[LUFFY]
'Kay! Here goes!

00:04:52.218 --> 00:04:53.520
[ZORO]
Make it snappy, Luffy!

00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:56.893
[KIN'EMON] Please join us for
the ride upward, Madame Ninja.

00:05:08.584 --> 00:05:14.329
Oh, boy! It's our surprise
finalist, and wayward wonderer,

00:05:14.362 --> 00:05:17.201
none other than... Lucy!

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:22.846
[CROWD cheers]

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.383
[SABO] I hope you're
watching over me, Ace!

00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:35.972
[LUFFY] "The Final Round Starts!
Diamante the Hero Shows Up!"

00:05:36.005 --> 00:05:41.550
[CROWD cheering]

00:05:44.957 --> 00:05:47.562
Lucy entered this competition
as an unknown,

00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:51.537
and yet his rambunctious spirit
and lovable character

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.075
captured the crowd's heart!

00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:57.447
Ah. The next contender,
on the other hand, antagonized

00:05:57.481 --> 00:06:00.955
the crowd relentlessly
in his qualifying bout!

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:04.729
The captain of a pirate crew
known as the Barto Club.

00:06:04.762 --> 00:06:07.267
It's Bartolomeo the Cannibal!

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.906
Go crawl back in your hole
and learn some manners,

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:11.743
you ugly punk!

00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:18.724
[BURGESS laughing]

00:06:18.758 --> 00:06:21.930
And next, he sails with
the Emperor, Blackbeard,

00:06:21.963 --> 00:06:27.508
and commands his first ship.
It's Jesus Burgess!

00:06:33.086 --> 00:06:35.891
I'll be the one taking
the prize home today,

00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:37.294
but I hope you can
give me a good fight

00:06:37.327 --> 00:06:39.464
all the same, Straw Hat!

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:50.655
[BURGESS laughing]

00:06:50.688 --> 00:06:53.292
[CROWD cheers]

00:06:54.495 --> 00:07:01.475
[BURGESS grunting, laughing]

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:03.914
That's what I'm talking about!

00:07:03.948 --> 00:07:06.853
[BURGESS chuckles]
Huh?

00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:13.767
[GYATS] Those boos and jeers
can only mean one thing!

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.239
Next up is the Phantom Princess

00:07:16.272 --> 00:07:21.415
of the detestable Riku
bloodline. Rebecca!

00:07:21.448 --> 00:07:22.918
You know, I'm starting to wonder

00:07:22.952 --> 00:07:25.323
if Rebecca is
the devil incarnate.

00:07:25.356 --> 00:07:28.597
Her victory against the powerful
contenders in Block D

00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:30.701
was frankly inexplicable.

00:07:30.734 --> 00:07:34.442
Even now, it remains a mystery!

00:07:34.475 --> 00:07:36.179
[coughs]

00:07:36.212 --> 00:07:39.318
[ATTENDANT A] Gyats! Are you
all right? Take a deep breath!

00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:42.659
[GYATS]
Water... Water...

00:07:42.692 --> 00:07:47.803
[exhales] I thought that
was the end of me.

00:07:47.836 --> 00:07:49.539
Where were we? Right!

00:07:49.573 --> 00:07:53.012
After clawing their way through
a phalanx of fearsome fighters,

00:07:53.046 --> 00:07:54.716
these four contenders
are lined up

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.689
for a final battle to
determine the champion!

00:07:57.722 --> 00:07:59.491
Which one of them
will be deemed worthy

00:07:59.525 --> 00:08:01.395
to wield the Flame Flame Fruit?

00:08:01.428 --> 00:08:03.867
Whoever wins, it's gonna
be a hell of a show!

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.207
So let's hear it one last
time for our contenders!

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.712
[CROWD cheering]

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:20.032
[SABO]
Hm?

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.581
[REBECCA]
That's not Lucy. Who is he?

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:31.857
Now, let me introduce the man

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.327
who's going to
test their mettle!

00:08:36.699 --> 00:08:39.438
[GYATS] One of the top
executives of the Family--

00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:41.543
he saved this kingdom from ruin,

00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:44.982
fighting alongside
Don Quixote Doflamingo!

00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:50.126
Those of you who frequent
the Corrida Coliseum

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:52.565
already know him as our
tournament promoter

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:55.470
as well as our hero!

00:08:55.504 --> 00:09:01.816
Now, without further ado,
Mister... Diamante!

00:09:03.219 --> 00:09:07.829
[CROWD cheering]

00:09:07.862 --> 00:09:11.368
â™ª

00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:14.074
[DIAMANTE grunting]

00:09:16.513 --> 00:09:19.519
[DIAMANTE grunting]

00:09:21.122 --> 00:09:22.925
Ow!

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.432
[grunting]

00:09:55.057 --> 00:09:56.559
Huh?

00:09:57.628 --> 00:09:58.997
Bang.

00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:04.709
[chuckles] Ooh.

00:10:04.742 --> 00:10:10.554
[CROWD cheering]

00:10:14.495 --> 00:10:16.633
It's a dream come true!

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:20.473
This is sure to be the finest
battle you've ever seen!

00:10:20.508 --> 00:10:22.578
The four winners
from the first round

00:10:22.611 --> 00:10:26.485
will be facing each other
as well as Mr. Diamante.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.924
These brave battlers
seeking strength,

00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.663
shall find it when they
lay claim to the prize--

00:10:31.696 --> 00:10:35.538
a Logia Devil Fruit, the
strongest of the three types!

00:10:35.571 --> 00:10:37.575
The Flame Flame Fruit!

00:10:37.608 --> 00:10:39.478
[CROWD cheers]

00:10:39.513 --> 00:10:41.617
[laughing]

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.653
I can almost taste it!

00:10:52.939 --> 00:10:55.645
[COMPETITOR A]
Stop the match, now!

00:10:55.678 --> 00:11:00.320
Take Rebecca out of the ring!
Redo the Block D match!

00:11:00.353 --> 00:11:03.961
Oh? A last-minute
objection to the fight?

00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:05.965
[COMPETITOR B] Whatever the
hell happened back there,

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:09.238
I don't accept it! Now fight me!

00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:10.608
There's no way all of us lost

00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:12.678
to a rotten little
shrimp like you!

00:11:12.712 --> 00:11:15.449
Time for us to set
the record straight!

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.659
Hell yeah! You guys
kick her ass!

00:11:24.535 --> 00:11:26.471
[DIAMANTE growls]

00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:29.712
Outta the way, buddy!

00:11:29.746 --> 00:11:32.618
[DIAMANTE] Don't be such
sore losers, gentlemen.

00:11:32.652 --> 00:11:34.522
Better to let it go.

00:11:34.556 --> 00:11:37.729
'Cause if you ruin my event,
you're gonna be sorry!

00:11:37.762 --> 00:11:39.465
Take me down to the...

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:41.335
[COMPETITOR A]
Screw you!

00:11:41.369 --> 00:11:43.841
OlÃ©! Keep it comin'.

00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:47.313
What, you think
this is a bull fight?

00:11:47.347 --> 00:11:48.883
And Lock.

00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:52.490
[COMPETITORS grunt]

00:11:56.733 --> 00:11:59.772
[COMPETITORS groaning]

00:12:00.774 --> 00:12:03.346
It may ripple like
an ordinary cape,

00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:06.051
but this is made of solid steel.

00:12:06.085 --> 00:12:09.692
I ate the Ripple Ripple Fruit
and became a flag man, y'see.

00:12:09.725 --> 00:12:13.099
All it takes is one touch
and I can make anything,

00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:16.706
even my own body,
flutter like a flag.

00:12:18.577 --> 00:12:20.446
[DIAMANTE]
Lock.

00:12:21.583 --> 00:12:22.317
[gasps]

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.758
This is Corrida Glaive!

00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:27.728
[COMPETITORS groaning]

00:12:41.388 --> 00:12:44.061
[DIAMANTE] I'd get moving
if I were you, gentlemen.

00:12:44.094 --> 00:12:46.566
We have a special
sort of Fighting Fish

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.471
in the water,
just for the final.

00:13:01.295 --> 00:13:04.201
[DIAMANTE]
They love the smell of blood.

00:13:04.234 --> 00:13:07.173
They're fine-tuned to it,
you might say.

00:13:28.116 --> 00:13:29.752
[COMPETITOR B]
It's flying...

00:13:29.786 --> 00:13:32.424
[COMPETITORS groan]

00:13:32.457 --> 00:13:33.960
Oh, wow!

00:13:57.875 --> 00:14:00.479
[CROWD murmurs]

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.757
You get a good look at that?

00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:08.162
Those Fighting Fish
don't hold back!

00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:11.435
[CROWD cheers]

00:14:11.468 --> 00:14:12.972
[DIAMANTE]
They're only supposed to attack

00:14:13.005 --> 00:14:14.609
once you fall in the water,

00:14:14.642 --> 00:14:16.880
but these guys
are rule-breakers!

00:14:16.913 --> 00:14:19.853
Why, the fish in the first
round are practically

00:14:19.886 --> 00:14:23.794
mild-mannered compared
to these savages!

00:14:23.827 --> 00:14:25.865
We hand-picked
the strongest fighter

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:29.337
from each school
just for this battle!

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:30.473
[CROWD cheers]

00:14:30.507 --> 00:14:31.943
[DIAMANTE]
If you look carefully,

00:14:31.977 --> 00:14:35.518
you'll see that one of them
has a surprise on his back.

00:14:35.551 --> 00:14:38.557
A treasure chest,
which holds none other than

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.326
the Flame Flame Fruit!

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:43.198
[CROWD cheering]

00:14:51.917 --> 00:14:54.655
The rules of the finals
are simple!

00:14:54.688 --> 00:14:57.093
Stay in the ring
and take the fruit

00:14:57.126 --> 00:15:00.767
from the back of the
fish to claim victory!

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.205
[CROWD cheering]

00:15:03.238 --> 00:15:06.512
It's finally here... The match
you've all been waiting for!

00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:08.683
It'll be a five-man
battle royale,

00:15:08.716 --> 00:15:10.721
including our hero, Diamante!

00:15:10.754 --> 00:15:13.593
They must avoid the wrath
of the deadly fighting fish,

00:15:13.626 --> 00:15:15.931
and scramble to
snag the treasure!

00:15:15.964 --> 00:15:18.536
Who among these fighters
will lay claim

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.541
to the Flame Flame Fruit?

00:15:20.574 --> 00:15:26.719
And now, let the battle begin!

00:15:59.686 --> 00:16:02.958
[GYATS] The tension is so thick,
you could cut it with a knife!

00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:06.331
One wrong move could send
them hurtling to their doom!

00:16:06.364 --> 00:16:09.037
Any of these fighters
could take home the prize,

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:13.212
but the rest will be
leaving in tears, if at all!

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.688
[GYATS]
They're sizing each other up.

00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:20.560
Who is gonna make
the first move?

00:16:22.163 --> 00:16:23.499
[BURGESS laughing]

00:16:23.533 --> 00:16:26.840
[GYATS] It's Burgess! And he's
flying straight at Lucy!

00:16:26.873 --> 00:16:29.912
[BURGESS grunting, laughing]

00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:39.699
[GYATS] He dodges deftly and
dashes to the outer circle

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:43.305
of the ring! What plan
is he cooking up?

00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:44.942
Huh?

00:16:51.722 --> 00:16:53.458
[SABO]
Here it comes.

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:07.219
Not that one.

00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:14.133
Yo. If you ain't got the
treasure, then buzz off.

00:17:16.037 --> 00:17:18.075
[BARTOLOMEO]
And don't come back!

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.279
[BURGESS] Trying to lure out the
one with the prize, Straw Hat?

00:17:20.312 --> 00:17:21.882
That's clever!

00:17:30.233 --> 00:17:32.437
This one is a dud, too.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.009
[BURGESS laughing]

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:50.106
Oh, yeah. I gotta admit,
this is fun as hell!

00:17:50.139 --> 00:17:51.475
Of course it is!

00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:53.813
'Cause I'm the one
running the show!

00:17:53.846 --> 00:17:55.483
Here in the Corrida Coliseum,

00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:57.420
I use every tool at my disposal

00:17:57.453 --> 00:17:59.290
to give the audience
the time of their lives!

00:17:59.324 --> 00:18:02.430
Do those "tools"
include us, too?

00:18:02.464 --> 00:18:05.436
Well, just have fun.

00:18:33.292 --> 00:18:36.131
[KIN'EMON] It would seem
that no one is present.

00:18:38.636 --> 00:18:40.841
[LUFFY]
Nice. Let's go.

00:18:40.874 --> 00:18:42.243
[VIOLET]
Hold on a second!

00:18:44.214 --> 00:18:46.351
[VIOLET]
Close the door first.

00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:57.574
[LUFFY]
Huh...?

00:18:59.646 --> 00:19:02.049
[LUFFY] Is that how you
get inside the palace?

00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:04.789
[VIOLET]
Shhh!

00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:08.863
The palace is above us.
That's the Rampart Tower.

00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:10.399
Oh.

00:19:10.432 --> 00:19:12.236
[VIOLET] There's actually quite
a bit of climbing left to do

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.746
before we reach Doflamingo.
And it's well-guarded, too.

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:19.351
Thankfully, the Rampart Tower
has a secret entrance.

00:19:19.384 --> 00:19:23.993
Let's go, but take care not
to let the guards notice you.

00:19:24.026 --> 00:19:26.498
They'll call the Executives
if we make a scene.

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:30.874
That won't be good. Especially
if we have to battle with Pica.

00:19:30.907 --> 00:19:34.013
Then any hope of
success would be lost.

00:19:35.249 --> 00:19:37.220
[KIN'EMON]
Hm, where is Sir Luffy?

00:19:37.254 --> 00:19:38.757
Uh-oh. Right there!

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.025
[VIOLET gasps]

00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:45.904
[LUFFY yelling]

00:19:45.937 --> 00:19:47.239
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Eh?

00:19:49.912 --> 00:19:52.884
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Whoa! What's up with that carp?

00:19:53.886 --> 00:19:56.592
Now, Gum-Gum...

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:02.036
Maybe it's actually a blowfish?

00:20:02.069 --> 00:20:02.838
That's freaky!

00:20:02.871 --> 00:20:05.109
...Giant Pistol!

00:20:16.297 --> 00:20:18.335
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES screaming]

00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:24.715
[KIN'EMON gasping]

00:20:24.748 --> 00:20:25.984
[ZORO gasps]

00:20:27.153 --> 00:20:28.155
[VIOLET whimpering]

00:20:28.188 --> 00:20:31.695
[ZORO, KIN'EMON]
What the hell is he doing?!

00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:42.216
[LUFFY]
It's open!

00:20:42.249 --> 00:20:44.321
[ZORO]
That's not the issue here!

00:20:44.354 --> 00:20:45.724
This is not good.

00:20:45.757 --> 00:20:47.427
Ah! You big blockhead!

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.299
Well, new plan. We're going in!

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:52.470
If we hurry, we might get lucky!

00:20:52.504 --> 00:20:54.407
[LUFFY]
Can I take this thing off now?

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.777
[VIOLET]
Not like I could stop you!

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.014
[KIN'EMON]
Now, now!

00:21:02.725 --> 00:21:05.095
Straw Hat?

00:21:05.128 --> 00:21:09.572
[alarm blaring]

00:21:09.605 --> 00:21:11.075
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
This is the front entrance

00:21:11.108 --> 00:21:12.611
to the Rampart Tower!

00:21:12.644 --> 00:21:17.754
Emergency! Straw Hat
Luffy has broken in!

00:21:17.788 --> 00:21:18.990
[DOFLAMINGO grunts]

00:21:19.023 --> 00:21:22.163
[CROWD cheering]

00:21:22.564 --> 00:21:24.367
[GYATS]
The Fighting Fish attacks,

00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:29.545
but Lucy leaps aside with ease!
Nobody else has moves like that!

00:21:29.578 --> 00:21:34.922
Huh...? What the hell
is going on here?

00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:42.804
You're sure it was
Straw Hat Luffy?

00:21:42.838 --> 00:21:44.307
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
Yeah! He smashed the gate in

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.476
with one punch!

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.446
I think you should get
your eyes checked.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.518
Straw Hat's fighting
in the coliseum.

00:21:49.551 --> 00:21:51.722
He's in disguise,
but it's sloppy.

00:21:51.755 --> 00:21:56.264
[CROWD cheering]

00:22:01.007 --> 00:22:03.212
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE F] This is
Rampart Tower, B-2, in front of

00:22:03.245 --> 00:22:06.251
the main dining hall!
I've confirmed it myself!

00:22:06.284 --> 00:22:09.524
Straw Hat Luffy
is one of the intruders!

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:15.704
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE F]
He's with Pirate Hunter Zoro!

00:22:15.737 --> 00:22:20.379
And wait... Lady Violet!

00:22:20.412 --> 00:22:22.818
There's another swordsman, too!

00:22:22.851 --> 00:22:25.823
Ahhh!

00:22:25.857 --> 00:22:29.096
[GYATS]
Lucy is really showing off!

00:22:33.372 --> 00:22:37.247
[DOFLAMINGO] Straw Hat Luffy
broke into the tower?

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.317
And he's here right now?

00:22:41.956 --> 00:22:45.396
[DOFLAMINGO]
Then who the hell is that idiot

00:22:45.429 --> 00:22:48.368
with the stupid disguise
fighting in the coliseum?

00:22:48.402 --> 00:22:51.207
Can somebody tell me
what's going on?

00:23:02.897 --> 00:23:05.570
[LUFFY]
I'm comin' for you, Mingo!

00:23:14.353 --> 00:23:16.324
[NARRATOR] Luffy and
friends continue to make

00:23:16.357 --> 00:23:17.761
quick progress in their mission,

00:23:17.795 --> 00:23:21.401
until they run into a massive
wall in the form of Pica.

00:23:21.435 --> 00:23:23.438
With the power to control
the palace itself,

00:23:23.472 --> 00:23:26.044
the final Don Quixote
family executive proves

00:23:26.078 --> 00:23:27.914
that he won't be
an easy obstacle

00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:29.885
for the team to overcome!

00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:31.589
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.622 --> 00:23:36.064
"A Moving Castle! The Top
Executive Pica Rises Up!"

00:23:36.097 --> 00:23:38.368
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
