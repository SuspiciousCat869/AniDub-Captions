wealth isn't enough.

348
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:30,408
<i>And I wouldn't let go</i>

349
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,038
<i>My only dream...</i>

350
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:44,464
<i>I won't stop chasing it</i>
<i>until it comes true</i>

351
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:47,884
<i>But if the world ever changes</i>

352
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,763
<i>I'll call out your name</i>

353
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:54,807
<i>We could return to the time</i>

354
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:58,770
<i>When everything's the same</i>

355
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:01,981
<i>As long as I'm with you</i>

356
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:05,902
<i>My memories won't fade</i>

357
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:12,033
<i>Waiting for that</i>
<i>one true dream...♪</i>

358
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,332
[LUFFY]
Usopp! Go save Kaya!

359
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,792
Leave the butler to me!

360
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,794
[ZORO] That guy can't
help but to be evil.

361
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:25,129
[LUFFY] Too bad.
I had something else in mind.

362
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:27,382
[ZORO] I'm going
after that hypno freak.

363
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,801
[LUFFY] Kuro! You're not
cut out for this!

364
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,804
I'll show you what a real
pirate looks like!

365
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,514
On the next One Piece:

366
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:35,807
"Beat Kuro!

367
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,142
Usopp the Man's
Tearful Resolve!"

368
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:40,478
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
