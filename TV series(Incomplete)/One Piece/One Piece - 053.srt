175
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,446
[stomach rumbles]

176
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,615
What's wrong? You're hungry too?

177
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,683
You skip dinner?
I know you skip lunch.

178
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,552
What is this, a hunger strike?

179
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,654
You think the big bad pirates
are gonna poison you?

180
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,857
Is that it?

181
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,294
If you just sit there like that,
he's gonna finish everything.

182
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,529
That's okay! More for me!

183
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,331
‐‐[APIS] Get back!
‐‐Whoa.

184
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,469
Yummy!

185
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,470
Yeah, I know it!

186
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,905
Was there any doubt?
I picked Sanji personally!

187
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,475
I've never had
anything this good.

188
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,709
You're finally smiling.

189
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:44,977
[SANJI]
Uh, Nami!

190
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,879
[NAMI]
Luffy are you eating again?!

191
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,881
What's wrong?
I didn't have much lunch.

192
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,484
[USOPP] Are you kidding?
You emptied two pots!

193
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,486
I don't remember.

194
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,422
You poor thing. Did you
really think we were evil?

195
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,723
Well, I guess.

196
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,991
Well, you aren't alone.

197
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,762
That's a common sentiment these
days. We're getting used to it.

198
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,030
You're not gonna sell me off?

199
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,164
No way!

200
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,366
You kinda do have an evil look.
I can see her point.

201
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,602
You're the expert on bad looks.

202
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,836
What the heck do you
think you're doing?!

203
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,338
Why you pulling my face?

204
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,507
Why are they such morons?

205
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,743
[chuckles]

206
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,579
We have plenty more
to eat, mademoiselle.

207
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,580
He's serious.

208
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,716
And if you stick around,
you'll see these pirates

209
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,786
are more friendly
and fun than scary.

210
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,721
I promise.

211
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,023
[APIS]
More please!

212
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,024
[SANJI]
As you wish.

213
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:32,725
[LUFFY]
Me too!

214
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,026
[SANJI]
Get your own, Luffy!

215
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,563
[LUFFY]
I already tried.

216
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,625
Huh? What the...?

217
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,665
[SANJI] Hey! What's the
trouble down there?

218
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,734
No trouble, I've just
been cooking.

219
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,668
[SANJI]
What?

220
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,437
Everyone, breakfast is ready!

221
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,573
Ah! Breakfast?!

222
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,475
I wouldn't get too excited.

223
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,314
[NAMI]
You made this all by yourself?

224
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,517
[USOPP] The appearance is...
quite unique. Yes, unique!

225
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,953
[LUFFY]
Yeah, let's eat!

226
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,654
Not only did you
guys rescue me,

227
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,157
but you've given me food
and shelter as well.

228
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,260
I finally found a way for me
to pitch in and help!

229
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,630
That's real thoughtful.
Thank you.

230
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,099
Uh... Is this
considered... food?

231
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,969
Just shove the food
in and eat it!

232
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,171
Seriously though, is this
stuff really safe to eat?

233
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,640
Oh, yeah. Tastes good.

234
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:55,808
Of course.

235
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:59,044
After all, you can't judge
a meal by appearance alone.

236
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,679
Are you sure?

237
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,152
[NAMI, ZORO, USOPP scream]

238
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,489
It wasn't that bad, was it?

239
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,360
Spicy!

240
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,795
My mouth feels
like it's on fire!

241
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,030
I must've used the
wrong seasoning!

242
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,165
[chuckles]

243
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,500
That's okay.
It's a common mistake.

244
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,336
Next time you'll know
which spice to avoid.

245
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,038
She took the time
to cook this feast,

246
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,040
the least you can do
is eat every crumb!

247
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,341
‐‐[USOPP, ZORO groan]
‐‐[SANJI] Shut up!

248
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,343
This little girl went out
of her way for you bums!

249
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,145
She deserves...

250
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,414
Excuse me, but I don't
think I got your name.

251
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,317
It's Apis! My name is Apis!

252
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,387
Apis deserves the respect
of seeing you eat her meal.

253
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,690
Besides, I won't allow anyone
aboard this ship to waste food!

254
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,258
[USOPP whimpers]

255
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,027
A bit later I'll be
happy to cook something

256
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,595
especially for you.

257
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,863
That'd be great.

258
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:54,834
I'm sorry. I know it's horrible.
I'm just not a very good cook.

259
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,236
All I wanted was to
do something nice.

260
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,272
Apis, don't worry.
Nobody's mad at you. Really.

261
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,708
How's this? You leave the
cooking to me from now on.

262
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,710
I'm sure that there are many
more interesting things

263
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,446
that you could do to help out.

264
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,583
Are you sure? This good stuff!

265
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,218
Why don't you make some
Bar‐B‐Q next time?

266
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,552
I haven't had it in forever!

267
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,622
And meatloaf with roasted
potaters after that!

268
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,393
[NAMI] So what's your story?
Why were you adrift at sea?

269
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,128
Were you stranded or
was someone after you?

270
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,730
[APIS]
I escaped from a Marine ship.

271
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,098
They were holding me prisoner.

272
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,299
[USOPP]
A Marine ship?!

273
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,101
[APIS]
I got away three nights ago.

274
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,071
Three nights ago?
That was during the storm.

275
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,708
Your little boat didn't
stand a chance.

276
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,143
[ZORO] How'd you get in
trouble in the first place?

277
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,279
They had to of held you
prisoner for a reason.

278
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,581
What could a little girl like
you have possibly gotten into

279
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,884
that got the attention
of the marines?

280
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,452
Everyone knows they're
a buncha twits,

281
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,221
but I still can't imagine them
labeling you an enemy.

282
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,090
What'd ya do?

283
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,825
Well, um... I...

284
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,894
What's wrong?
Are you hiding something?

285
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,297
[APIS] No! It's nothing like
that! You have to believe me!

286
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,299
I'm innocent.

287
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,835
But still...
I can't talk about it.

288
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,270
[USOPP]
You can't tell us?!

289
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,472
[SANJI] Easy, easy.
What's the big deal?

290
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,773
She must have her reasons.

291
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,276
If she doesn't wanna say,
we shouldn't press her.

292
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,144
Yes, I agree.

293
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,113
But it would be helpful if
you would at least tell us

294
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,114
where you're from?

295
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,283
Uh. Eh... Um...

296
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,319
I'm from... It's a place
called Warship Island.

297
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,421
Warship Island?

298
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,322
Do you know it?

299
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,424
No, but it should be
labeled on the map.

300
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,626
Odd name. Why's it
called Warship Island?

301
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,861
[APIS]
Uh... well...

302
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,197
Because the shape of the island
looks exactly like a warship.

303
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,266
Heh! I like it!

304
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,634
Uh! Look!

305
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,304
[USOPP] Ah! It's close
to the Grand Line.

306
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,306
[NAMI] We're here so the
distance between us

307
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,508
and Warship Island
is reasonable.

308
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,944
Well what do you wanna do, Apis?

309
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,346
We can take you
back to your island.

310
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,714
We're headed to the Grand Line,

311
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,650
but it's no problem
for us to drop you off.

312
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,286
Thank you.

313
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,822
You were all so nice to
save me and I feel bad

314
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,891
for having you go
out of your way.

315
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,327
But I wanna go home
more than anything!

316
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,329
I'm sorry. I'm being selfish.

317
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,531
Maybe you could hand me to
a ship that's heading west

318
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,899
on your way to the Grand Line.

319
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,702
I'm sure I can handle things
on my own from there.

320
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,804
Absolutely not! No way.

321
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,340
A pirate ship can't even get
close to another vessel

322
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,508
without them attacking
in blind fear.

323
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,912
[APIS]
Yeah, you're right.

324
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,515
But still, we're not on anyone's
timetable other than our own.

325
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,652
And Warship Island isn't that
far off. So we can do it.

326
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,486
[APIS]
What?!

327
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,655
Well, I'm fine with
this either way.

328
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,490
And you, dear Captain?

329
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,325
Sure. Sounds great to me!

330
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,727
It's close to where we're going.

331
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,830
I know! And the island
looks like a warship.

332
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,398
Think that's a yes.

333
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,599
Really?!

334
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,568
You don't mind changing course
and taking me back home?!

335
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:43,836
Nope.

336
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,839
[APIS] Yes! Thank you, thank
you, thank you! I'm going home!

337
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,707
You have no idea
what this means!

338
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,843
I didn't ever think I'd
make it out of the ocean,

339
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,012
let alone back to
Warship Island!

340
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,014
You're amazing! All of you!

341
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,783
I'll prepare tons of
dishes for you, for everyone!

342
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,284
[NAMI, ZORO, USOPP, SANJI]
No! That's okay!

343
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,919
[LUFFY]
But why not?

344
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,796
[MARINE D]
Reporting!

345
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,432
Vessel sighted, Sir!
Straight ahead, 12 o'clock!

346
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,533
A mid‐size Caravel.

347
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,303
The main mast is flying
a flag with a skull mark!

348
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,271
Pirates, huh?

349
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,940
Obviously a novice bunch
to be openly sailing

350
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,810
in waters under Commodore
Nelson's control.

351
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,746
These inept scum aren't
worth our time! Let them be!

352
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:31,583
[ERIC] You're mistaken. That
flag belongs to a savvy crew.

353
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,552
The captain is Straw Hat Luffy,

354
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,388
a man with a 30 million‐berry
bounty on his head.

355
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,991
What? Everyone's been
looking for that pirate!

356
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,092
[ERIC]
What I find inept

357
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,795
is that even with this giant
fleet at our disposal,

358
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,597
we can't find one little girl.

359
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:49,501
It's plausible that someone
managed to nab her, yes?

360
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,070
Perhaps a certain
highly skilled pirate

361
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,440
who just happens to
be in the vicinity?

362
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,610
Capture that ship at once!

363
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,283
I can't help feeling
something's wrong.

364
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,953
[USOPP] Hey! We've got
company approaching!

365
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,323
Just our luck! We're in deep
trouble! It's the Marines!

366
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,458
Marines?!

367
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,459
[USOPP]
And we're not just talking

368
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,761
one or two ships, either!

369
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:16,995
He's right!

370
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:21,300
Why would the Marines dispatch
an entire fleet to this area?

371
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,369
What's goin' on?

372
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,472
Are they here to claim
the bounty on my head?

373
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,540
[NAMI] They wouldn't send
this many just for you!

374
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,843
[LUFFY] Maybe the Marines feel
they need an entire fleet

375
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,811
to capture me.
I am kind of amaz‐‐

376
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,980
[NAMI]
Shut up! This isn't a joke!

377
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,814
What's wrong with you?

378
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,817
[APIS]
Those ships belong to Branch 8!

379
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:42,721
They're the ones I escaped from!
What am I gonna do?

380
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,195
[MARINE D] Lieutenant Commander!
I found her!

381
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,231
The girl's standing on
the deck of that ship!

382
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,298
What?!

383
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,135
Think of your failure
had I not happened along.

384
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,537
I've gone and hurt
your pride, haven't I?

385
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,206
Such wounds to the ego
often heal quickly.

386
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,175
Though should you allow
the clue to the Dragonite

387
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,410
to slip through your
grasp a second time,

388
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,246
not even the Elixir
of Immortality

389
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,014
could soothe the wounds
Commodore Nelson

390
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,482
will inflict upon you.

391
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,151
[LT. COMMANDER]
Prepare the main cannons!

392
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,418
We'll capture that pirate ship,

393
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,054
or give it to the
bottom of the sea!

394
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,025
[screams]

395
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,528
They're firing at us!

396
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,666
[LT. COMMANDER]
Attention, pirate!

397
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,002
You have trespassed
into restricted waters

398
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,371
and are hereby ordered
to stop and surrender.

399
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,706
There's no way we're
gonna stop for Marines.

400
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,209
How you wanna handle this?
'Cause I wanna fight 'em.

401
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,377
[LUFFY]
Then I say let's fight.

402
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,678
You're crazy!

403
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,681
Why must we always fight against
impossible odds?! What makes...

404
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,250
Apis, go downstairs
and wait in the cabin.

405
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,018
Okay.

406
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,119
[USOPP]
A raid isn't gonna work!

407
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,954
‐‐[LUFFY] We'll make it work.
‐‐[USOPP] We're doomed!

408
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,522
[ZORO] No one's saying
you have to come along.

409
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,523
Back us up with the cannon.

410
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,192
[USOPP] Really?
So I'm staying on the ship?

411
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,960
Okay, I can live with that!
You guys...

412
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,528
Apis. What is it?

413
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,397
A wind's coming.

414
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,966
He says it's a strong one.

415
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,702
[NAMI] Zoro! Lean the
sail pointing south!

416
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,371
Usopp and Sanji,
right rudder full!

417
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,306
Get going!

418
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,373
‐‐[USOPP] Uh... Right...
‐‐[SANJI] Yes, Nami!

419
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,441
What's happening?

420
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,444
A gust is coming.
We'll ride it out and move on.

421
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,246
If we try to take out
the fleet head on,

422
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,648
we'll end up losing,
no matter how well we fight.

423
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,117
Somebody sounds chicken.

424
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,588
[NAMI]
This girl...

425
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,290
They show no signs
of stopping, Sir.

426
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,959
They mock us!

427
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,295
[NAMI]
Here goes!

428
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,732
Ah!

429
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,068
The pirate ship has increased
its speed and altered course!

430
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:36,735
Heading?!

431
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,337
[MARINE D]
Southbound, Sir!

432
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,440
Southbound?! The fools!
Don't they have maps?

433
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,442
Surely they know what's
in that direction!

434
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:47,679
What the hell are you
waiting for?! Move! Attack!

435
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,085
Ha! Whoa! This is fast!
We got a good wind huh?

436
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,422
We did it, Luffy! Look!
The Marines are falling behind!

437
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,759
I've seen dead
snails move faster!

438
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,162
No use! We can't catch up!

439
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:08,100
This fleet can't match
one small ship? Dimwit!

440
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,802
Smaller ships have the
advantage of better mobility.

441
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:14,306
Give me results, not excuses!

442
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,710
Um, Sir, it's too dangerous
for us to go any further.

443
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,679
‐‐Lieutenant!
‐‐I know!

444
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,515
Attention fleet! All, stop!
Prepare to turn around!

445
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,351
[ERIC] Delay that order!
Why are you stopping the ships?!

446
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,120
[LT. COMMANDER] Because if we
continue on this course,

447
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,054
we'll get trapped
in the Calm Belt!

448
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,189
[ERIC] I don't care!
Go after them! Now!

449
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,190
I will not!

450
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,626
You don't grasp the dire
nature of this mission.

451
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,129
We must apprehend
that little girl!

452
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,298
Or you can look forward
to explaining your failure

453
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,133
to Commodore Nelson
in person!

454
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,734
Then I'll accept my punishment.

455
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,536
But I'll be damned
if I give orders

456
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,472
that would doom this fleet
to be swallowed by the sea!

457
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:51,176
Yell as long and loud as ya
like, but this chase is over!

458
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:55,480
Idiot! I'll have your head!

459
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,149
[USOPP laughing]

460
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,817
[USOPP]
They aren't following us! See!

461
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:03,555
Ol' Captain Usopp can even
scare a Marine fleet away! Ha!

462
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,858
[LUFFY] Perfect! Another triumph
by our expert navigator!

463
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:07,993
[SANJI]
Well done, Nami.

464
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,330
Incredible how you detected
that wind before it hit.

465
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,665
[NAMI] Oh, all I did was pay
attention to my gut instinct.

466
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,201
[SANJI] Only you could be
humble in your perfection.

467
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,537
[LUFFY] Shall we continue
on to Warship Island?

468
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,172
[APIS]
You mean you'll still take me?!

469
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,340
[LUFFY]
Of course.

470
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,209
[USOPP] Okay, then! To Warship
Island it is! Let's...

471
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,410
[USOPP, LUFFY]
...go!

472
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:26,878
What's wrong? Huh?

473
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,514
You've had that brooding look
on your face for a while.

474
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,184
Yeah. I guess I hoped
I was dreaming.

475
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:32,851
'Bout what?

476
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,453
This may sound crazy,

477
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,521
but it seems to me
we're not even moving.

478
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,856
You feel that?

479
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,696
[NAMI]
Now that you mention it,

480
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,533
the sail doesn't appear to be
catching any wind at all.

481
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,605
[NAMI screams]

482
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:54,906
[LUFFY]
Nami, what's wrong?

483
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,475
[SANJI]
Are you hurt?!

484
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,778
We're screwed!

485
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,881
We've entered the Calm Belt!

486
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,551

487

[LUFFY]
What exactly is the Calm Belt?

508
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:23,462
[USOPP] We're supposed to head
straight to Warship Island! Ah!

509
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,465
[ZORO] Luffy gets us into one
reckless thing after another!

510
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,667
[NAMI] Don't you find something
mysterious about Apis?

511
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,901
Like she's hiding a secret?
