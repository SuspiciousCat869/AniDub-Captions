to save this country.

176
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,284
Goodbye, Princess.

177
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,787
[screams]

178
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:40,793
[CROCODILE laughing]

179
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:55,141
[laughing continues]

180
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,898
[CROCODILE]
It can't be.

181
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:23,836
[LUFFY]
Crocodile!

182
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,541
Luffy!

183
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,910
[growls]

184
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,345
It can't be!

185
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,765
Just in time.

186
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,870
[crying]

187
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,939
[VIVI]
Luffy. Pell.

188
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,710
[VIVI]
There isn't much time left

189
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,479
until the Square is blown up.

190
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:47,486
[VIVI]
Everyone is already down there.

191
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,058
My voice can't...
it can't be heard,

192
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,295
no matter how loud I yell.

193
00:14:56,328 --> 00:15:00,833
At this rate, the
country will fall apart.

194
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,503
[LUFFY]
Don't worry, Vivi.

195
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,684
As long as we're here, your
voice will always be heard.

196
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,494
[ZORO]
I'm telling you again.

197
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,664
My injuries are a whole lot
more severe than yours are.

198
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,966
[NAMI] Oh, quit whining
and act like a man!

199
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,769
My leg is hurt,
so I can't stand!

200
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,504
Oh, no! I'm gonna faint!

201
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,606
[ZORO]
You're such a liar!

202
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,980
[yelling]

203
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,351
Best of luck, Luffy. Be careful.

204
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:56,789
[LUFFY] I ate tons of meat,
bird guy. I'll be just fine!

205
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,335
[LUFFY]
I won't...

206
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,370
...lose to you.

207
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:22,047
How did he make it out of the
quicksand with all his injuries?

208
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:28,053
[screams]

209
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,223
It's Luffy! He's alive!

210
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,525
Tony's here, too.

211
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,227
[USOPP]
What? Luffy!

212
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,028
Luffy!

213
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,831
[CHOPPER]
And Vivi's here, too!

214
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,166
See! See! He's still alive!

215
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,235
What did I tell you?!
I knew it all along!

216
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,236
Really?

217
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,404
[SANJI] For someone
who knew it all along,

218
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,772
you sure look surprised.

219
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,608
[EYELASH grumbles]

220
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,577
Usopp! Sanji! You're all right!

221
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,613
[SANJI] Ahh! Vivi, what
happened? Are you okay?

222
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,248
You look like you've been hurt!

223
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,784
[NAMI yells]

224
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,087
Nami, too. And Mr. Bushido?

225
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,891
Everyone... is alive.

226
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,693
[NAMI]
Usopp, who asked you to create

227
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,229
some useless prop for parties?

228
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,531
Oh, come on! You're
standing up just fine!

229
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,100
[SANJI]
Nami, my love!

230
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,704
Well, it did have a powerful
attack. Right, Nami?

231
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,440
Just shut up. I am going
to deal with you later.

232
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,809
Vivi.

233
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,810
What's going on?

234
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,613
What's up with all this
dust flying everywhere?

235
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,382
Explain yourself, idiot!

236
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,718
How could you let Nami
get injured like that?

237
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,219
What happened?

238
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,455
She's fine, let it go.

239
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,423
[USOPP groans]

240
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,159
Listen, Chopper, do me a favor.

241
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,794
Bury my body out
in the wastelands

242
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,629
when I'm dead and gone. Agh!

243
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,665
No, Usopp! Don't die!

244
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,613
I'm sorry, you guys.

245
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,483
I know I lost to
him once already.

246
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,153
This time....

247
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,491
[LUFFY]
This time....

248
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,792
...I'm gonna win!

249
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,627
The rest is up to you!

250
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,963
So get goin' already.

251
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,364
[chuckles]

252
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,668
If you can't beat this guy,

253
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,504
then I don't know
anybody who can!

254
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,513
[LUFFY]
I'm gonna put an end to this.

255
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,881
For good!

256
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,184
[USOPP, NAMI, CHOPPER]
Yeah!

257
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,691
Thank you.

258
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:49,895
After all that's happened,
all of you are still with me.

259
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:56,301
[growling]

260
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,872
[LUFFY]
Crocodile!

261
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:06,745
[growling]

262
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,814
Try all you want.

263
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:12,718
But no matter how many times
you swing, you'll never hit me.

264
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,487
I guess you didn't get
enough the first time, huh?

265
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:21,527
[yelling]

266
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,001
[chuckles]

267
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,012
[groans]

268
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,926
Now Gum‐Gum...

269
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,461
What the‐‐? Who's that?

270
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:04,436
[yelling]

271
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,808
How can he... hit me?

272
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,444
[LUFFY]
...Buzzsaw!

273
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,797
[chuckles]

274
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,977
He hit Crocodile!

275
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,455
[LUFFY]
Get up.

276
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,523
I figured something out

277
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:35,527
when some of my Yuba water
dropped on your hand.

278
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,396
Once you touch water,

279
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:41,366
then you can't turn
into sand anymore.

280
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,801
You took away all the rain

281
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:46,505
because you're afraid
of water, didn't you?

282
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,377
I know how to defeat
you, Crocodile.

283
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,982
Our real fight is starting now.

284
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,166
<i>♪Can somebody point to</i>

[LUFFY] I'll get you
this time, Crocodile!

307
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,733
[NAMI] Try not to lose
against this jerk again!

308
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,635
[ZORO] You sure took your
time getting here!

309
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,504
[USOPP] Okay, then I'll
leave the rest to you!

310
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,173
[SANJI] Hey! Don't run away.
We gotta look for the cannoneer!

311
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,307
[CHOPPER]
Is he nearby?

312
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:32,477
[VIVI] There's no time left!
This is our last chance!

313
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,745
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

314
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,783
"Sand Croc and Water Luffy!
The Second Round of the Duel!"

315
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,485
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates.
