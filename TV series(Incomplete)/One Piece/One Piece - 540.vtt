WEBVTT

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.171
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.174
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.877
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.414
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.515
You can have it!

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.385
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.723
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.326
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.992
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.895
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:45.932
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.235
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.838
to ever chart these waters
and learn all the secrets

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:53.006
they held.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.841
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:57.243
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.445
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:02.982
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:06.252
a boy whose body became rubber
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:09.889
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:13.426
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.731
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:21.501
Luffy and his crew arrive
on Fishman Island,

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:25.572
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.907
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.212
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.583
It's not long before
the Straw Hats get pulled

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:39.219
into the conflict.

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.354
[JIMBEI] Thankfully,
two individuals rose up

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.089
on Fishman Island.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:45.191
Individuals who would
help change the course

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.127
of our beleaguered history.

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:51.064
The first was... Queen Otohime.

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.701
Then there was him,
the legendary hero,

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.236
named Fisher Tiger.

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.672
Who freed countless slaves.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:03.543
Nevertheless,
they fought for our future.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:06.446
And both of their tales
end in tragedy.

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:11.484
[LUFFY]
"A Hero Who Freed the Slaves!

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:12.919
An Adventurer Tiger!"

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:23.563
I'm going to tell
you an important story

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:24.931
from our past.

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:27.333
Regretfully, the incidents
within this tale

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:31.704
set in motion Arlong's
rampage in the East Blue.

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:34.340
I hope this can bring us
to some understanding.

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:38.044
Yeah, I'm listening.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.422
Before I get into the details,

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:52.358
you must know how our world
was 16 years ago.

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:59.432
[PAPANEEL panting]

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:00.433
[PAPANEEL]
Move it!

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:01.501
[FISHWOMAN A yells]

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:02.935
[FISHMAN A]
Thief!

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.105
Stop him! He's getting
away with our money!

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.541
Somebody do something!

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:09.609
[gunshot]

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.377
[FISHWOMAN A whimpers]

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.945
Just stay outta my way!

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.080
Got it?

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:15.682
'Cause ya don't wanna
see what I'll do to this girl

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:17.283
if ya try to be a hero!

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.718
[FISHWOMAN A screams]

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.455
Huh? Your majesty?

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:27.026
Wait! Don't go that way!

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.729
You shouldn't involve yourself
with such a thing!

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:33.066
This is not our responsibility!

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.167
[GUARD A]
Please, wait!

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.368
[GUARD B]
Queen Otohime!

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.738
[PAPANEEL]
Who's that?

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:40.840
Don't come any closer!
I'll shoot!

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.878
[grunts] I warned you!

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.090
[PAPANEEL gasps]
I missed?

00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:58.758
Dammit! Get back!

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:01.694
[PAPANEEL gasps]

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.331
[PAPANEEL grunts]

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:08.434
[FISHWOMAN A screams]

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:09.569
I got you!

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:28.955
Wait, isn't that...
Queen Otohime?

00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:30.289
Ow!

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:31.724
[FISHMEN]
Oh, no!

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:34.160
--[OTOHIME] My hand!
--Hurry, doctor!

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:35.828
[DOCTOR A] Your Highness!
Let me take a look!

00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:40.500
It's fractured, I'm afraid.

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.769
[FISHMAN C] She hit him once
and broke her hand?

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:43.836
It's fine.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.871
[DOCTOR A]
Huh?

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:47.073
[DOCTOR A]
Queen Otohime!

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:51.644
The queen?

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:54.280
Why would you do
something as foolish and selfish

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:55.815
as robbing your fellow people?

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:56.983
[PAPANEEL]
What do you care?

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:59.585
Like a rich member of the royal
family could understand!

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:01.988
I got ten kids waiting
at home and all they do

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:04.257
is cry 'cause they're hungry!

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.091
[PAPANEEL grunts]

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:06.492
All the more reason!

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.995
[PAPANEEL grunting]

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.298
No! Queen Otohime!

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:14.300
You must stop hitting him!
Please!

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:15.668
You're much too delicate!

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:17.637
You will only make
your injury worse!

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.773
I don't care! I have to do this!

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:23.109
Even if my hand must
shatter to pieces,

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:24.544
he will learn his lesson!

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:31.017
Do you think your
children would be happy

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.351
if they knew the truth?

00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:34.320
If they knew their
father was a thief?

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:39.759
[OTOHIME] You should be
trying to live your life

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.727
in a way that makes them proud!

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:45.364
--[blows landing]
--[PAPANEEL grunting]

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:51.204
[OTOHIME]
However...

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:56.676
I owe you... [sniffs]
an apology.

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:00.580
[PAPANEEL]
Huh?

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:01.781
Please forgive me!

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:05.885
Even though I'm your queen,

00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:08.321
I've been completely
ignorant to the hardships

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:12.692
that one of my subjects
has been forced to endure!

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:15.228
My heart can't take it.

00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:19.232
Your worries and your pain,
they're killing me!

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:22.535
[crying]

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:26.205
You must have had
a reason for doing this.

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:27.740
I don't know.

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:29.909
It's not that I wanted to.

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:30.843
But I...

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:33.679
I felt like there
was no other way.

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:38.150
Somebody set fire to my store
and stole all my money.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:41.053
We couldn't save anything
before it burned down.

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:43.556
Just like that,
I didn't have a job.

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.491
My debts started piling up.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.126
And now my kids are starving!

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:52.298
I'm sorry that happened,
and I understand.

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:54.033
I really do, but...

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:55.101
It's wrong!

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:56.402
[FISHMEN]
Huh?!

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:58.271
If you do to others
what was done to you,

00:08:58.304 --> 00:08:59.772
the cycle will never end!

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:01.807
[PAPANEEL]
I'm sorry!

00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:03.409
No, I'm sorry!

00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:05.511
We weren't there for you
in your time of need,

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.014
so that makes us
accountable as well!

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:10.616
[PAPANEEL] Your highness,
it's really not your fault.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.219
But that's a terribly generous
thing for you to say!

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:14.820
[OTOHIME]
It's still wrong, though!

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:16.455
[PAPANEEL]
I know! I know!

00:09:16.489 --> 00:09:18.658
[OTOHIME]
Then don't do it!

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:19.825
[PAPANEEL]
You changed me!

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:20.993
And my whole life!

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:22.461
Thank you so much!

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:24.764
After seeing how much
you cried for me,

00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:26.299
I'll never steal again!

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:27.767
I know that you won't!

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.702
Best of luck in the future!

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:32.004
We're so lucky to have
a member of the royal family

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:33.606
who's not afraid
to share the troubles

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:35.608
of common people like us.

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.476
She nearly had me
crying along with her,

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.744
though I certainly hope
she doesn't break

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:40.212
her hand next time.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.082
Our Queen Otohime is
a one-of-a-kind ruler,

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:44.584
I can tell you that much!

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:46.419
She has such a kind heart!

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:47.620
And look there!

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:49.789
Even the children of
the kingdom adore her!

00:09:49.822 --> 00:09:51.958
Queen Otohime!

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:59.298
I'll do everything I can
to protect your smiling faces!

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.700
[FISHMEN]
Huh?!

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:02.568
[OTOHIME]
Your nose is running terribly!

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.871
If I don't reprimand
you for it, who will?

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:07.607
You look ridiculous
with mucus dribbling

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.175
out of just one side.

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:12.778
It's more dignified to
dribble from both nostrils.

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:15.948
[FISHBOY A cries]

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:18.250
Such a tender moment!

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.186
I guess so.

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:23.255
[JIMBEI] No one was more
passionate or loving.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:26.359
Every day, Queen Otohime
descended from the palace

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:28.094
to address the nation.

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:30.596
That day was no different.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.431
The time has come
for us to relocate

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.667
the Ryugu Kingdom
to the surface!

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.771
"Our skins are different colors"
and "we do not look the same."

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:41.140
These are the things the
humans say in order to avoid

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:43.743
understanding us and
our unique way of life.

00:10:43.776 --> 00:10:45.611
But that's why we should move!

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.980
To understand each other!

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:50.616
Our worlds are
10,000 meters apart!

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.252
So, that is also the
distance between our ways

00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:54.353
of thinking!

00:10:58.557 --> 00:11:00.226
[OTOHIME]
I know you're afraid.

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:02.762
After all, the humans
who come to our island

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:05.464
are pirates and criminals.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.633
And the humans who buy
our people from kidnappers

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:11.137
like them are cruel
and corrupt nobles.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.205
It's true that our only
exposure to humans

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:14.473
has been negative.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.909
But, that doesn't mean
we can judge all humans

00:11:16.942 --> 00:11:18.310
the same!

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:20.112
I believe in my heart
that there are good ones

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:21.981
among them as well!

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:24.016
And thus, to improve relations,

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.652
we must move our kingdom
to be under the same sun!

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:32.458
It is my goal to express
our intention to relocate

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:35.261
above sea level at this
year's World Summit!

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:37.963
But in order to do that,
I need all of you to sign!

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:41.634
[CROWD murmuring]

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:42.968
While, uh...

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:46.105
I admit it sounds like a good
idea in theory, but...

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:49.208
Just the thought of living
near humans is, well...

00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:55.514
I understand how you feel.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.917
However, this is our chance
to make a real change

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.721
rather than
suffering in silence!

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:02.755
Please!

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.958
Look, I'm sorry, but no.

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:18.070
It's no use.

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:20.372
History can't be fought
so easily.

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:31.517
Hello, everyone! I'm home!

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.387
[laughs]

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:42.261
--I'm home! Shirahoshi!
--[SHIRAHOSHI crying]

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:54.673
[OTOHIME] Ah, I hope you
can forgive me, darling.

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:56.442
Mommy didn't mean to be so late.

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:02.581
Even with your nose
running on one side,

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.517
you're still beautiful!

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.652
We stayed with her the
entire time you were gone

00:13:06.685 --> 00:13:08.187
so she'd feel safe, Mother!

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.156
It's true, Mother, we did!

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:12.324
I have such brave sons!

00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:13.893
But what happened to your hand?

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:15.628
Are you okay?

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:19.331
Oh, don't worry, dear,
it's nothing. See?

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:21.734
To ensure you all
have a bright future,

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:25.171
I would suffer so much
worse than this.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.376
If Queen Otohime wants
to make announcements,

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:32.011
she really should
do them by video

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:34.280
rather than going
down there in person.

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:37.917
[NEPTUNE] Unfortunately, thanks
to her strong Observation Haki,

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.451
doing something like
that would go against

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.020
her very nature.

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:42.922
She would rather win
the hearts of the citizens

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:45.424
in person than from the palace.

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:48.394
It's one of Otohime's
guiding principles.

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:50.329
Not even I can change that.

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:52.331
She's constantly putting
her life at risk

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:55.534
with all those human pirates
coming and going on the island!

00:13:55.568 --> 00:13:56.936
We know you're on good terms

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:59.338
with Whitebeard, and to
some extent his influence

00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:01.674
can protect her
while she's there.

00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:03.809
But anything could happen!

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:07.012
[NEPTUNE] That is a fact of
which she is all too aware.

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:09.548
And yet, it does
nothing to deter her.

00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:13.385
For the world Otohime
dreams of is far more

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:16.322
than a simple fantasy.

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:19.758
After all, unifying our
peoples was also the ambition

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:21.393
of our ancestors.

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:23.762
Although, they were never
able to make that vision

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:25.464
a reality.

00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:26.465
What?

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:29.668
I'm afraid that I don't follow,
Your Majesty.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.770
[NEPTUNE] I can't
stop Otohime from doing

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:33.639
what she thinks is right.

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:36.242
So it's up to you
to keep her safe!

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:37.843
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Yes, sir!

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:41.680
[CROWD laughing, chattering]

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:44.717
Huh? Hey! Where ya goin',
fish girl?

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.551
[FISHWOMAN D]
Sir?

00:14:45.584 --> 00:14:47.620
How 'bout some special service.

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:48.687
[FISHWOMAN D]
I'm sorry.

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.689
I don't think I know
what you mean.

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:51.857
Huh?

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.093
Come on, now,
don't be such a snob!

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:56.161
We know how you Fishmen are!

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:05.537
What's wrong?

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.473
You punks got something to say?

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:11.844
[PIRATES chuckle]

00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:12.912
[JIMBEI]
Get out of here.

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:13.946
[PIRATES]
Huh?

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:20.686
[JIMBEI]
You're ruining my meal.

00:15:22.154 --> 00:15:25.024
Ah... Sorry.

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:53.452
[NAMI] This Queen Otohime
certainly seemed unique,

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:55.020
if nothing else.

00:15:55.054 --> 00:15:56.855
Sounds like she
was a crybaby too.

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:58.457
Did you inherit that from her?

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.660
Um... Yes. I suppose I did.

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:05.197
Hold on, you used to be
a soldier for the kingdom?

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.333
When you grow up
in the Fishman district

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:08.934
where you know
nothing but fighting,

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:11.036
there aren't a lot of
career-path options

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.604
available to you.

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.006
You don't say.

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:15.341
That's rough!

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.376
Isn't that where
you're from, Hachi?

00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:20.579
It sounds like a pretty
bad neighborhood.

00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:24.350
It was. Believe me.

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:26.452
Originally it was an
orphanage for children

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:29.154
with no living relatives.

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:31.757
But in time, the orphanage
became too much

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.193
for the administrators
to handle.

00:16:34.226 --> 00:16:35.260
Before long,

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:37.262
it became a lawless area
that caught the eye

00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:40.866
of delinquents from
all over the island.

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:43.969
Back then, Fisher Tiger was
the closest thing we had

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:48.240
to a leader, but he left
to have his own adventures.

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:50.209
I'd been his second in command,

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:53.412
but I went on to
join Neptune's army.

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:55.314
And despite being Fishmen,

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:58.751
Macro and some others started
helping the kidnappers.

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:01.453
As for everyone else,

00:17:01.487 --> 00:17:02.755
they all left.

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:05.057
Following their own pursuits.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:08.560
Until one day...

00:17:08.594 --> 00:17:10.295
[FISHWOMAN E]
Please, give them back!

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.331
[ARLONG] Oh, you almost
had 'em that time!

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:13.632
Hey, knock it off!

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:15.334
Do you realize how hard
it was for her to get

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:16.635
all of those signatures?

00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:19.304
[ARLONG] Yeah, and you
realize I don't care, right?

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:22.808
[laughs]

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:25.644
[ARLONG] These papers aren't
gonna change a damned thing,

00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:26.645
get it?

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:28.080
[GUARD B]
Hey, cut it out!

00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:30.182
You Fishman District reject!

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:31.216
[ARLONG]
Huh?

00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:34.553
You think you're better
than me because of

00:17:34.586 --> 00:17:35.888
where I'm from?

00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:37.723
[GUARD B gags]

00:17:37.756 --> 00:17:39.425
Let go of me!

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:41.994
You got it backwards, pal!

00:17:42.027 --> 00:17:44.963
I'm the captain of
the Arlong Pirates!

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.433
And you're just a nobody!

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:50.569
I clean up all the human
garbage you let run wild.

00:17:50.602 --> 00:17:54.373
Pirates so pathetic, they can't
even breathe in the water.

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:57.643
You guys in Neptune's Army
should be thanking us!

00:17:57.676 --> 00:18:00.312
Maybe I should beat
a donation out of you.

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:02.147
Please!
I'm in trouble over here!

00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:04.083
He's gonna kill me, Boss Jimbei!

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:05.184
[ARLONG]
"Jimbei"?

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:08.787
All right, punk.

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:11.223
Just put the rookie down
and walk away.

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.792
He's weak, but he's
one of my men.

00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:16.228
And as for those
papers you've taken,

00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:18.030
they may not mean
anything to us,

00:18:18.063 --> 00:18:20.466
but they're quite
important to her majesty.

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:21.467
Give 'em back.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.368
That's Boss Jimbei
of Neptune's army!

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:24.503
He'll help us!

00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:25.904
[ARLONG laughs]

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:27.239
They call you "boss"?

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:29.341
How'd ya get that
kind of respect?

00:18:29.374 --> 00:18:31.510
Sounds more like
the title of a gang leader

00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:32.911
than a soldier, though.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.713
I told you to
let him go, Arlong!

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:38.117
All right, fine.

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:40.953
[ARLONG]
Here!

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:43.755
So are we all good now, brother?

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.557
[FISHMAN L]
Wait. "Brother"?

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:46.859
[ARLONG]
It's been a while.

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:48.594
But I can always tell
when someone's from

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:50.529
the Fishman District.

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:52.498
Don't lump me in with you.

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.900
You went off and became
a lousy pirate.

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:56.235
You're scum.

00:18:57.035 --> 00:18:58.804
[ARLONG]
Don't call me that, brother!

00:18:58.837 --> 00:19:00.239
Then how about "trash?"

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:01.507
Oh, that's it!

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.909
Doesn't matter where we're from,
you can't talk to me like that!

00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:06.044
[FISHMAN A]
Hey! Hey, everyone!

00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:07.946
Fisher Tiger's come home!

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.081
[FISHMAN B]
I don't believe it!

00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:10.616
Tiger's back!

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:11.617
[FISHMAN C]
He's here!

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:12.985
[FISHWOMAN A]
How was the trip?

00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:14.086
It's Brother Tai!

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:15.521
Finally made it back!

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:16.655
Hi, Jimbei!

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:17.789
And Arlong!

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:20.025
It sure looks like you two
have been doing well!

00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:22.728
[JIMBEI] That was quite a
lengthy voyage you took!

00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:24.696
[TIGER]
Yeah, an eventful one, too.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.899
Now that you're here,
you can see my ship!

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:27.833
[TIGER]
Later.

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:30.302
First I need to go to
the Ryugu Palace.

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:32.237
[JIMBEI]
I can show you the way.

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:34.673
He has no need
for a lousy pirate.

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:35.741
Huh?

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:38.277
That's not how Big Brother
feels about me at all!

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.278
[TIGER chuckles]

00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:41.813
C'mon, guys, don't fight!

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:43.815
[FISHMEN laugh]

00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:58.063
[NEPTUNE] You're telling me
you're going to free the slaves?

00:19:58.096 --> 00:20:00.365
Surely, you can't be serious.

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:02.134
[TIGER]
I'm afraid I am.

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:04.102
I can't stand it anymore.

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:07.973
The thought of our people
living a nightmare.

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:10.409
Even as we're
speaking right now,

00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:13.312
our people are being
treated like animals.

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:14.947
[NEPTUNE]
Yes, but...

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.515
[TIGER]
My mind's made up.

00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:18.817
I just wanted to tell you
before I did anything

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.320
since it's going to
cause you a lot of trouble.

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:25.757
Despite that, I ask that you
keep this to yourselves.

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:29.261
[NEPTUNE] Tell me, why are
you so adamant about this?

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:30.796
What did you see on your trip?

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:39.071
I saw human nature.

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:12.571
[JIMBEI] Not long after that,
Tiger made his move.

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:14.439
[FISHMAN N]
This is bad!

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:15.474
[grunts]

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:18.176
[JIMBEI]
What's the problem?

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.045
Oh, good, I found you, Boss.

00:21:20.078 --> 00:21:21.246
It's about Tiger!

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.017
It seems he... he attacked
the Celestial Dragons!

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.752
No, that can't be true!

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:31.790
[JIMBEI] Fisher Tiger
unleashed all-out war

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:34.126
on the holy land of Marie Jois.

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:36.862
For freeing the slaves,
he forever became a hero

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:39.998
to our people, and a criminal
to the World Government.

00:21:46.672 --> 00:21:49.608
Consider this my
resignation from the army.

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:50.909
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Jimbei!

00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:54.112
You would walk away
from your sworn duty?

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:55.480
Much to my surprise,

00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:58.517
I've enjoyed my role as
this island's protector.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.852
However, my obligation
to this kingdom

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:02.454
does not outweigh
my debt of honor.

00:22:07.225 --> 00:22:09.194
It looks like Big Brother
Tai has finally

00:22:09.227 --> 00:22:10.595
made his move!

00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:12.898
All right, Arlong Pirates,
from here on,

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:15.100
we work for Fisher Tiger!

00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:16.835
[ARLONG]
Let's go, men!

00:22:16.868 --> 00:22:18.904
[ARLONG PIRATES yell]

00:22:18.937 --> 00:22:20.505
[JIMBEI]
Before long, every ruffian

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:22.774
from the Fishman District
had assembled to fight

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:24.142
by his side.

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:30.716
How does it feel to be lumped in
with lousy pirate scum?

00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:34.086
[TIGER] It's us against
the world from now on.

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:36.321
If you're truly ready
for the days ahead,

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:37.389
then step up.

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:45.530
[JIMBEI] All who accepted
the Sun Mark that day

00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:47.032
became brothers.

00:22:47.065 --> 00:22:50.369
It was a symbol that enveloped
the brand given to slaves.

00:22:50.402 --> 00:22:52.971
No longer could anyone
distinguish which of us

00:22:53.004 --> 00:22:54.906
had always been free,

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.510
and which of us had to fight
to reclaim that freedom.

00:22:58.543 --> 00:23:01.246
And that's how
a bunch of lowlifes

00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:04.182
from the Fishman
District rose up...

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:05.684
...as the Sun Pirates.

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:17.162
[NARRATOR] Fisher Tiger attacks
the holy land of Marie Jois,

00:23:17.195 --> 00:23:20.365
freeing those enslaved
by the celestial dragons.

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.067
as his journey continues,

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.836
he encounters a human girl
with a tragic past

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.239
who he vows to
reunite with her family.

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:30.108
Unfortuntely, his actions
have drawn the attention

00:23:30.142 --> 00:23:33.111
of a very deadly adversary.

00:23:33.145 --> 00:23:34.880
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:38.316
"Kizaru Appears!
A Trap to Catch Tiger!"

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.185
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
