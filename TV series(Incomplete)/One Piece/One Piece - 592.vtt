00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:05.922
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.576
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:42.495
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:44.789
These wild and dangerous
seas are known

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.709
as the New World.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.836
Gold Roger and his
crew were the only men

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:51.629
to ever chart these
waters and learn

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.548
all the secrets they held.

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.425
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.844
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.804
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.600
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.685
a boy whose body
became rubber after eating

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:08.730
the Gum-Gum Fruit,
sets sail into the New World

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.481
with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:13.902
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:19.365
[NARRATOR] After a fierce battle
at the bottom of the sea,

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:21.659
the Straw Hat Pirates depart
for the deadly waters

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.538
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.207
Their first stop is Punk Hazard,

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:29.751
an island divided into
burning and frozen halves.

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:32.212
There, they find the former
laboratory of the "genius,"

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:34.339
Dr. Vegapunk.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.133
Seriously?
The samurai just ditched us?

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:38.092
Yes.

00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:39.761
[SANJI (NAMI)]
I thought it was too quiet!

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:41.137
When I mentioned
that I had fought with

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.307
a lone torso earlier,
he asked me where I had seen it.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.518
I told him I lost it
somewhere around the lake.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.021
Damn it. Let's go find him.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.440
[NARRATOR] Sanji, Brook,
and Zoro leave the laboratory

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:55.610
and head towards the lake
in search of Kin'emon.

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.320
[SYND yells]

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.280
You're acting weird, Synd.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:00.740
Are you feeling bad?

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.201
[CHILDREN gasp]

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.244
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Mocha!

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:08.456
Children! What's the matter?

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.333
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
NHC10.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.836
I detected it in their
sweat samples.

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:17.548
It's only a trace
amount, but still.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.133
This is a stimulant!

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:20.260
[SYND]
Candy...

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.428
[grunts]

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.722
You've gotta help me, Straw Hat.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.641
I really need a piece of candy.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:27.725
Get it for me!

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:28.977
Sorry, but I can't.

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:30.687
Chopper's the doctor of my crew.

00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:33.147
I trust him;
whatever he says goes.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:34.524
So I can't do it!

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:37.110
[SYND]
Go get my candy!

00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:38.903
[yells]

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.863
[USOPP]
Special Attack, Sleep Star!

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:53.376
[USOPP]
That worked like a charm!

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.711
They're sound asleep.

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:01.092
[NARRATOR] After learning that
the children are test subjects,

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.928
Luffy agrees to help reunite
them with their parents.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.930
He then sets out
to find the person behind

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.724
the experiment.

00:05:07.765 --> 00:05:09.851
[LAW]
What about the Straw Hat crew?

00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:12.103
[CAESAR CLOWN] I didn't think
much of the Straw Hats,

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:15.356
that is, until Monet
warned me about them.

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.775
It might be overkill,
but I'm sending those two

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.152
after their crew.

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:29.203
[LUFFY]
"To Annihilate the Straw Hats!

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.539
Legendary Assassins Descend!"

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:49.599
[NAMI (FRANKY)] Whatever you do,
please don't forget about us!

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.726
They could come looking
for us at any moment,

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.603
so get back as soon as possible!

00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:54.479
[USOPP]
Huh?

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.272
[yells]

00:05:56.314 --> 00:06:00.526
Ow, you're a cyborg now, Nami!
Please, be careful!

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.362
[CHOPPER (SANJI)] I hope this
"Master" guy comes clean

00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:04.864
about why he's experimenting
on these children.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.407
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)] If he
doesn't, I'll have to force it

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.533
outta him!

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.452
He'll talk when I threaten
to shove my foot

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:12.330
so far up his butt that
it comes out his nose!

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.666
Franky.
What did I say about talking?

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:18.544
'Kay! We ready to go?

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.588
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Good luck, you guys!

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.382
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
Be careful out there!

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:26.844
So hold up.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.846
Was Usopp trying
to knock him out, too?

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.481
[ROCK]
It's me. Here's the thing.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.775
So far, we've got three.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.110
[CLOWN A]
What?

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:44.612
[ROCK]
The Pirate Hunter Zoro.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.156
The Cat Burglar.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.409
And the Soul King.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.077
We left them at
the bottom of a cliff

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:52.954
in District F-16.

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:55.790
You'll need to get out there
and recover the bodies.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.792
[CLOWN A]
Hold on, did you kill them?

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.377
[ROCK]
Why? Is that a problem?

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.920
[CLOWN A]
Well, I dunno, I mean...

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.880
[SCOTCH] If you didn't want
'em to end up dead,

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.216
then you shouldn't have
asked us to do the job!

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.300
[CLOWN A]
It's fine!

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.469
The Master did say he
wanted them dead or alive.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.722
[ROCK] Now, now, no need
to get so worked up.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:12.682
[SCOTCH]
You're right.

00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:15.810
He almost lost it there, huh?

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.603
Yeah. Stay cool.

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:19.939
[CLOWN A] Thanks gentlemen.
We're counting on you!

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.242
[CAESAR CLOWN] Shurororo!
Oh, my! Did you hear?

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.244
Three of them are already dead!

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.455
I heard. [chuckles]

00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:37.123
What a disappointment.

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:39.417
The Straw Hats are part
of the Worst Generation,

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.419
as is our friend Law here.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.546
Not only is the government
keeping its eye on them,

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.548
but so is Blackbeard.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.508
The papers go on
and on about them.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.178
I keep reading about
how they're back in action.

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:52.638
I assumed they'd
be a lot stronger.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.765
Well? Law?

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:58.019
You know them, don't you?

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.563
I understand you've
crossed paths twice.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:03.024
Two years ago at Sabaody.

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:06.777
And then again at
the war in Marineford.

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.112
That true?

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.871
Why, you traitor! You didn't
summon them here, did you?

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:19.290
How many times do we
have to go over this?

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.250
I didn't even know they
were being held captive

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:25.213
in the laboratory until
I ran into them out front.

00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:26.422
If I had known,

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:28.549
I'd've told you to try
a different tactic.

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.427
Locking them up in an
ordinary cell isn't enough.

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:40.228
Let's talk about
your negligence.

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.021
I wasn't able to drive
the Navy out,

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:43.397
and it's thanks to you.

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:45.441
If this operation were exposed,

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.902
it'd be just as bad for me
as it would for you.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.199
[CLOWN B]
Master!

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.493
[CAESAR CLOWN] I'm in the
middle of an experiment!

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.328
[CLOWN B] But it's one
of the Seven Warlords!

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:02.166
Is it, now?

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.752
You want to stay here
on Punk Hazard?

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.337
It was a pain trying
to reach this place

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.089
since Log Poses don't work.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.507
I should've known,
what with this being

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.676
a secret government
lab, and all.

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.469
And why do you want to stay?

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:17.098
I assume that since this used
to be Dr. Vegapunk's laboratory,

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:19.350
there must be records of
all the government research

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.018
that's happened here.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.604
That's as forthcoming as
I'm willing to be right now.

00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:26.440
Here's the deal.

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:29.860
What I want is free roam
of the lab and the island.

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:31.404
So whaddya say?

00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:32.905
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Hmph.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.825
[LAW] In exchange, I'll provide
you with my assistance.

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:38.077
And we'll stay out of
each other's business.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:41.664
But there's one condition.
You can't tell anyone I'm here.

00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:44.166
Not even "Joker."

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:49.547
So you know, do you?

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.507
Where'd you get
that information?

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:54.176
Would you rather an ignorant
idiot wander in here?

00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:56.846
Or someone like me?

00:09:56.887 --> 00:09:58.973
Shurororororo!
Good point.

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.434
We're birds of a feather,
aren't we, Law?

00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:04.979
While I don't trust you,
I see no harm in your request.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:06.439
Well, Monet?

00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:10.985
[MONET] Trafalgar Law
from the North Blue.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.070
Interesting.

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:15.990
The Surgeon of Death who
consumed an Op-Op fruit.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.117
So you're a doctor, are you?

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.785
We've got several
former prisoners

00:10:19.827 --> 00:10:22.246
who've been paralyzed
by poison gas.

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.874
You can treat them.

00:10:24.915 --> 00:10:25.916
Can't you?

00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:35.301
[CAESAR CLOWN]
It's true.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:36.927
I suppose if you'd
called them here,

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:39.221
you would've been more discreet.

00:10:39.263 --> 00:10:41.432
You had to do a lot of
sucking up to the government

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.934
to land your cushy Warlord job.

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:45.436
Surely, you wouldn't
risk losing it all

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.480
by making a mess of things here.

00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:48.939
How silly of me.

00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:50.608
My apologies.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.193
Listen.

00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:54.111
You said somethin' about
the children begging

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:56.072
to come back without
you even having to lift

00:10:56.113 --> 00:10:57.615
a finger.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.408
What did you mean by that?

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.951
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Ah, yes.

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:03.162
They'll never leave because
I've been giving them

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.414
drugged candies.

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:09.126
It's sweet, it's fizzy, and it
fills your mouth with gas!

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:11.128
Ah yes, it's also a stimulant!

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.672
[laughs]

00:11:12.713 --> 00:11:15.091
And a highly addictive
one, at that!

00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:17.176
If they go home,
they won't be able to get

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:19.804
their precious candy anymore.

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:21.931
You're one sick puppy,
aren't ya?

00:11:21.972 --> 00:11:23.599
You remind me of someone.

00:11:26.894 --> 00:11:28.145
[MONET]
Where are you going?

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:29.814
Aren't you gonna fight the Navy?

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:32.525
You can call me if you need me.

00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:35.111
And I'll bring you the
head of anyone you want.

00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:37.363
[door opens, closes]

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:43.327
The clever ones are trouble.
They're hard to manage.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.334
I really hope Zoro's doing
all right out there.

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.670
[CHOPPER (SANJI)] Sanji and
Brook are with him so he's fine.

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.422
They'll make sure he
doesn't end up getting lost

00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:55.881
in the mountains or anything.

00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:57.633
[explosion]

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.887
[NAMI (FRANKY) yells]

00:12:01.929 --> 00:12:03.222
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
What the heck?

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:08.144
[NAMI (FRANKY) yells]
Not again!

00:12:08.185 --> 00:12:09.687
What's going on?

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.897
Uh-oh!
This isn't an earthquake!

00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:13.274
We're under attack!

00:12:19.613 --> 00:12:21.490
What are those things?

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:23.826
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)] They look
like big footprints to me.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.244
[USOPP]
Did an animal make them?

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:27.913
It couldn't have been a human,
unless they're a giant.

00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:29.540
[explosion]

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:39.049
[USOPP]
Wha--? Explosions?

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:41.635
That's odd, we just came
from that direction.

00:12:41.677 --> 00:12:43.137
Do ya think it could
be tied to whatever

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:44.764
left these footprints behind?

00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:50.144
I can sense something--
and they're close.

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.772
Beast-lookin' guys. Big ones!

00:12:52.813 --> 00:12:54.106
Let's go back!

00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:56.066
Nami and Chopper are in danger!

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:02.573
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
What'll we do?

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.033
If the cave starts
collapsing on us,

00:13:04.074 --> 00:13:05.743
they'll be goners!

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.161
Luffy, where are you?

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.038
We could use your
help right now!

00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:10.372
There's nobody here but us,

00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:12.374
so we'll just have to
handle this on our own!

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:26.472
Chopper!
You see 'em? How many enemies?

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.015
Tell me!

00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:29.183
Well, uh...

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.606
There's nobody out here!

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.566
But how can that be?

00:13:46.408 --> 00:13:48.661
'Kay.
Let's get this party started.

00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:09.139
[SCOTCH, ROCK]
So cool!

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.537
Ah! What're we gonna do?

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:33.122
Someone's out here.

00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:35.583
[BROWNBEARD snoring]

00:14:38.752 --> 00:14:42.256
What just busted my noggin?
Oh. I fell asleep.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:45.217
Huh? What's with all
the ruckus outside?

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:47.094
Maybe someone's
come to rescue me!

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:48.679
But who?

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:52.141
Law? The Master? No.

00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:55.352
We're in the snowy mountains,
so it's gotta be them.

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:58.397
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Huh? I heard that! Spill it!

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:00.149
You know who's attacking, right?

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.652
I demand that you tell us!
Or else you're gonna pay!

00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:09.408
[NAMI (FRANKY) grunts]
Bzz! Bzz! Bzz!

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.619
Bzz! Bzz!

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.163
You better not be
makin' fun of lasers!

00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:15.414
[BROWNBEARD]
Ha!

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.124
You're wasting your
time lookin' for 'em

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.626
'cause they're never
gonna show themselves

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:20.169
to you.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.545
We work with 'em
and we don't know

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.464
what they look like.

00:15:23.505 --> 00:15:24.506
But...

00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:26.342
We do know that
once they're paid,

00:15:26.383 --> 00:15:29.845
they'll carry out any
assassination without fail.

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:31.555
Everything else is a mystery,

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.265
except that their
footprints are huge

00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:35.351
and their voices are deep.

00:15:35.392 --> 00:15:36.435
Oh, wait.

00:15:36.477 --> 00:15:38.646
Also, they're some
sort of beast-men.

00:15:38.687 --> 00:15:41.482
And they're covered in
fur from head to toe.

00:15:41.523 --> 00:15:43.776
Or so the rumors say.

00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:45.945
They prowl the snowy peaks,

00:15:45.986 --> 00:15:49.031
appearing whenever
a blizzard strikes!

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:50.032
Oh, yeah!

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.785
I almost forgot,
we also know their names:

00:15:52.826 --> 00:15:55.162
they're Scotch and Rock!

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.331
The Yeti Cool Brothers!

00:15:57.373 --> 00:16:00.668
They're from a snowy region
and they're about 25 years old--

00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:02.795
Sounds like you know
plenty about 'em!

00:16:02.836 --> 00:16:05.881
But nobody knows what
they look like, lassie!

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:07.675
Still, they're tough.

00:16:07.716 --> 00:16:10.302
And they've come to
this cave to rescue me!

00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:11.595
You're in trouble!

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:14.431
If they're here, that means
you're on their hit list!

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:16.684
[laughing]

00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:17.935
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:23.857
[SCOTCH]
You're Brownbeard, aren't you?

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:27.987
Just so ya know, you happen
to be on our hit list, too.

00:16:29.363 --> 00:16:30.698
[BOTH scream]

00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:32.074
Who's that guy?

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:33.993
He's ginormous and I
didn't even notice him

00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:35.285
sneak in here!

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:37.037
Huh? Rock, is that you?

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:38.455
[SCOTCH]
I'm Scotch.

00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:40.165
You've come here to kill me?

00:16:40.207 --> 00:16:41.750
Wait, no. Sorry.

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:43.210
I must've misheard you!

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:45.045
Man, you really had me scared.

00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:46.505
The Master would
never have me killed,

00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:48.549
so he must've sent
you to save me, right?

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.300
Well, tell ya what,
if you'll unchain me,

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:52.636
I'll help you take care
of the Straw-- Eek!

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:54.430
[SCOTCH]
You didn't mishear anything.

00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:57.307
The Master ordered us to
assassinate you, too.

00:16:57.349 --> 00:16:59.268
What? No way!

00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:01.687
[SCOTCH]
You want proof?

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:02.980
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Oh, and while we're at it,

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:05.399
what was that big guy's
name again?

00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:06.775
His voice!

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:08.485
[CAESAR CLOWN] The one with
the silly-looking braided beard

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:10.654
who was captured
by the Straw Hats.

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:13.407
You know, the dunce who's
famous for being stupid?

00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:15.367
Oh, that's right! Brownbeard!

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:16.660
No!

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:17.953
Is that him?

00:17:17.953 --> 00:17:19.997
[CAESAR CLOWN] He's a fool, so
it was easy to manipulate him,

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.082
but now he's become a nuisance.

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:24.209
I don't need his
services anymore.

00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:25.335
Kill him.

00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:38.223
I was right!
Look, there's smoke!

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.311
Nami!

00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:43.353
Chopper!

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:45.105
We're on our way!

00:17:48.942 --> 00:17:50.736
[SCOTCH]
I'll ask again.

00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:52.738
You're Brownbeard, aren't you?

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:12.466
[CAESAR CLOWN] I'm so glad
you've joined us, Brownbeard.

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:14.051
There's no need
for you to worry.

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.969
I promise that you're safe here.

00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:18.180
Shurororororo!

00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:26.355
Wait, aren't you--?

00:18:26.396 --> 00:18:28.023
Yeah. Keep quiet.

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:33.821
[PIRATES yell]

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:39.993
How?

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:43.205
What's the matter?
You don't like your new legs?

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:49.753
[BROWNBEARD laughing]

00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:53.507
[BROWNBEARD]
No.

[BROWNBEARD humming]

00:18:58.595 --> 00:19:00.722
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Anything to report?

00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:02.266
[BROWNBEARD]
No, Master! It's all clear!

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:04.893
Nothin' but snow as far
as the eye can see.

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:05.936
That's good.

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:08.063
Thank you, Brownbeard.

00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:09.731
You're a fine patrolman.

00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:12.943
Huh? Aw, shucks!

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:16.321
[laughs]

00:19:16.363 --> 00:19:20.284
[BROWNBEARD]
No... I'm begging you.

00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:27.875
[BROWNBEARD]
Don't do it!

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:30.460
Master!

00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:37.509
[SCOTCH]
That'll shut you up!

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.219
You shouldn't've lost your cool!

00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:51.231
[ROCK]
Hey, Scotch!

00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:52.441
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
That must be the other one!

00:19:52.482 --> 00:19:54.067
[ROCK]
Don't shoot so recklessly.

00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:56.653
This place could collapse
and kill the brats.

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:57.696
[SCOTCH]
Oops.

00:19:57.738 --> 00:19:59.781
You're right,
that wouldn't be cool.

00:20:01.658 --> 00:20:02.910
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
Brownbeard!

00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:04.870
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
But they're on the same side!

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:06.914
[ROCK]
It looks like we've got company.

00:20:06.955 --> 00:20:09.291
Their captain's back.

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:11.335
Let's take care of them first.

00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:19.426
[USOPP]
Oh, crap! Those guys're scary!

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:20.594
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)]
Are they giants?

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.471
[ROBIN] Mm-mm.
Not any kind I've seen.

00:20:22.512 --> 00:20:23.639
[LUFFY]
I'm warnin' you, jerks!

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.016
You better not have
hurt any of my crew!

[LUFFY yells]

00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.531
What the--? Where'd he go?!

00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:52.334
[NAMI (FRANKY) yells]

00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:56.338
[LUFFY grunts]

00:21:02.177 --> 00:21:03.303
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
Luffy!

00:21:05.138 --> 00:21:06.473
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
They captured Nami!

00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:08.475
Those big jerks took
her with them!

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:09.518
Huh?!

00:21:18.193 --> 00:21:21.029
[SCOTCH] The Master said
he wants this one alive.

00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:23.865
[ROCK] Right, the robot
with Vegapunk's lasers.

00:21:23.907 --> 00:21:25.867
[SCOTCH]
But we can kill the rest of 'em.

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:29.288
[ROCK] In that case, let's take
our time and enjoy this hunt.

00:21:29.329 --> 00:21:31.373
[SCOTCH]
Sounds cool to me!

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.583
[BOTH laugh]

00:21:42.342 --> 00:21:44.553
I think it's safe to assume
that the detachment

00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:46.346
team has stolen the ship by now.

00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:48.307

[MARINES chattering]

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.977
What happened here?

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.361
It's an ambush!

00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:04.614
[ALL yelling]

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:07.326
Just when I thought
it'd be easy.

00:22:07.367 --> 00:22:08.243
Let's go!

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:09.453

Yeah!

[CLOWN D]
It's Law!

00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:25.886
[CLOWN C]
Where do you think you're going?

00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:30.557
[CLOWN D]
You can't leave right now!

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:32.684
Not when the Navy's in the area!

00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:33.852
[LAW]
Room.

00:22:36.104 --> 00:22:37.814
[CLOWN C]
Huh? What the--?

00:22:57.626 --> 00:23:00.420
[LAW]
I don't give a damn.

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:03.423
You guys may not
know this, but...

00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:04.841
I go where I want.

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:19.231
[NARRATOR] Luffy's group
attempts to get Nami back

00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:21.316
by pursuing the Cool Brothers.

00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:24.778
Unfortunately, our heroes are
beseiged by an assortment

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.071
of clever traps,

00:23:26.113 --> 00:23:28.698
as well as a constant barrage
of attacks by the pair of

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.659
mysterious assassins.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.870
Suddenly, Law appears and
makes a surprising move.

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:35.455
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:36.581
"Save Nami!

00:23:36.623 --> 00:23:39.459
Luffy's Fight on the
Snow-Capped Mountains!"

00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:42.170
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
