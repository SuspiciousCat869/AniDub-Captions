WEBVTT

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:05.005
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:08.041
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:10.744
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:13.046
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.382
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:18.318
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.587
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.522
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:26.726
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:35.054
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:37.991
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:42.295
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:45.431
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body became rubber

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.066
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.737
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.941
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.312
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.081
Luffy and his crew
arrive on Fishman Island,

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:05.718
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:08.087
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:12.892
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:15.595
[LUFFY]
Friends or enemies, huh?

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.730
Don't ask me.

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:21.734
'Cause I'd say...
it's up to you!

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.206
[LUFFY]
"A Big Clash!

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.742
The Straw Hats vs.
A Hundred Thousand Enemies!"

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:35.682
[FISHMEN chattering]

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.717
Uh, hey, guys? Is that him?

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.918
I really hope not.

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:41.354
'Cause he's invaded the
Navy headquarters twice,

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.189
and we're no navy!

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.425
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE B] Well,
that looks like his pirate ship.

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:48.261
Not to mention his
crew. So, yeah.

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:10.316
[BOTH chuckle]

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.818
[chuckles]

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:16.356
Ha! Come on! Really?

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.891
What kind of weirdo
hides inside a shark?

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.561
[ZEO] I'm more concerned with
how that skeleton and the others

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:24.597
managed to escape
from the Ryugu Palace.

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:26.332
[FISHMAN D] About time
you showed up, Straw Hat!

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.234
[FISHMAN E]
I can't believe he came!

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.502
[FISHBOY B]
Madam Sharley!

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:32.305
That pirate you were
talking about. He's here!

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:35.708
Yeah, he just saved the
princess and the king!

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:38.011
[SHARLEY]
The Straw Hat boy.

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:43.650
Yeah, yeah. I'm here.

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:44.717
How was that?

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:47.453
It could've gone worse,
considering it was Luffy.

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:50.156
[JIMBEI] Mm. Not exactly
what we had planned,

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.358
but I can't argue
with the results.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:54.994
Yuh-huh!

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:57.497
No! You're staying right here!

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.433
Don't fight. It's pointless.

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.935
C'mon. We're just wastin' time!

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.437
Yes, right.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.506
If we don't hurry,
they'll kill Father.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.207
I already told you, Jimbei!

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:11.544
Get outta my way so I can go
and kick this Hordy guy's ass!

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:13.246
[JIMBEI]
And I told you to wait!

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.081
You aren't listening at all!

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:16.916
Let me finish speaking!

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.852
Now, how would you describe
the relationship between us?

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.154
We're friends!

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:22.689
That's right.

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:24.590
Although it is a
simple matter for us,

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.125
our two peoples
have been struggling

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.529
to establish such a
relationship for decades now.

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:32.398
I left you a message
saying not to fight Hordy,

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:35.401
because I didn't want
you facing him recklessly.

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.437
Don't you see?

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.505
Think of how the
Fishmen will view you.

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.908
If you rush in and show
aggression towards Hordy,

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:43.343
you'll be viewed as
nothing more than

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:46.446
just another human bully
oppressing our kind.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.081
That is not what we want.

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:50.383
No. You should be a hero.

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:52.251
One that saves the island!

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:54.287
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.722
[LUFFY]
A hero?

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:56.656
Hell no!

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:57.657
But why?

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.659
Obviously because we're pirates!

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:00.493
Come on!

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:04.697
Heroes are great,
but I'm not one!

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:05.732
Seriously.

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:08.735
Do you even know what
you're asking me to do?

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:11.304
Let's say there's
a chunk of meat, right?

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:13.873
Pirates will have a
banquet and dig right in.

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.675
But a hero would give
it to other people

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:17.276
instead of eating it.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.313
Screw that. My meat is mine!

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:22.515
What a reason.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:25.118
[SANJI sighs]
It figures, dummy.

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:26.052
Luffy.

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:27.620
I'll let you have all
the meat you want.

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:29.589
Just do as I say.

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:30.523
That's fair.

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.859
--[CAMIE giggles]
--Huh?! No way!

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.360
[JIMBEI]
I'll make this simple.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.295
There will come a time
when I need your help,

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:38.931
so you'll rush in when
that moment arrives.

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:39.832
Okay.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:42.769
Good. But first, the plan.

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:46.439
We'll get caught,
on purpose, to get us close.

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:47.540
[MEGALO gasps]

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:50.109
Afterwards, while their
attention's on me,

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:53.746
then one of you pirates will
sneak out of Megalo's stomach

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.816
and get yourself into position,
to make your attack.

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:58.985
Did you say his stomach?

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:05.258
The Celestial Dragon's letter.

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:07.760
They have it. We need it.

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:10.129
Hold on. What's this letter?

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:11.798
Jimbei. Remember?

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:14.834
Luffy was sleeping through
most of your story.

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:17.036
He doesn't know.

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:20.339
In short, the letter is
something Queen Otohime

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:23.176
acquired ten years ago
at great personal risk.

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:26.112
It will define the very
future of this island.

00:07:26.145 --> 00:07:27.713
They'll also have
the key we'll need

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:30.016
to release the king
from his bonds.

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:32.652
One of your crewmates
must retrieve them.

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:34.420
Which one of you's
up to the task?

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:35.888
I'm pretty good at stealing.

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:39.158
But still, I think I'll
need Robin's help.

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:40.960
Of course.

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:44.363
Good. Once you've managed
to free the king, get out.

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:46.799
I'll call Luffy and
we'll take over.

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.534
After you emerge
from Megalo's body,

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:51.904
the people of Fishman Island
will understand your intent,

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:54.006
because they'll see you
and I are working together

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.509
against a common foe.

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:59.278
Princess. I must ask that
you stay somewhere safe

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.413
outside the plaza.

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.547
It's for the best.

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.149
We'll pass the letter to you,

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:06.619
whereupon, the entire
royal family can escape.

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:08.988
During this time,
the rest of you will have to

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:13.159
head to the Ryugu Palace to
rescue your imprisoned friends.

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:14.527
Once they're free,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.064
get to the plaza to back
us up as soon as possible.

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:22.535
As for how you go about
saving them, well...

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:23.903
...that's for you to deal with.

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:26.305
Come on! Be specific!

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.075
Wow! You can count
on us, big time!

00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:32.044
After all, we've got
the Sunny, right?

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:34.847
So no worries. We'll be there.

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:39.018
Once this is set in motion,
there's no turning back.

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:40.853
We must succeed.

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:44.624
[HACHI grunts]
Everyone here respects Jimbei.

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:46.759
Whether they're a
civilian or outlaw,

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:48.995
they'll follow
after his example.

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.463
[CAMIE]
Mm. That's right.

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:54.066
So if they see Jimbei working
with a human, even a pirate,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.069
they'll cheer you on or
maybe even fight beside you.

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:59.906
I mean, it's possible.

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:01.107
Straw Hat.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.041
[JIMBEI]
Hm?

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:03.776
Please, Luffy.

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:08.147
I'm only doing this
'cause you asked me to!

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.749
Got that? I mean it.

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:11.450
Having people cheer for me?

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:13.452
No thanks. I don't like it!

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:16.489
I'm more for taking their
money and running away.

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:17.590
[SANJI]
Speak for yourselves!

00:09:17.623 --> 00:09:18.925
I'd go to the depths of hell

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.827
if I knew the mermaids would
be there to cheer me on!

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.829
Very well then.

00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:26.365
Sounds like everything
is settled, then.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:31.837
[NAMI]
All right. Let's do this thing!

00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:33.472
Wait.

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:34.674
Yeah? What's up?

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:36.442
Something wrong?

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:37.743
What's our codename?

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:39.845
Are you kidding? Who cares?

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:42.048
[LUFFY]
Can we go already?

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.785
[JIMBEI] At any rate,
it appears you were able to

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:48.054
save your friends
from the palace.

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.488
[PAPPAGU]
Straw Hat!

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:51.624
Huh? Pappagu!

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:53.693
What's up? It hasn't
been that long.

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:54.961
[PAPPAGU]
I know, I know.

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:57.863
But I almost died! Many times!
'Cause of those guys!

00:09:57.897 --> 00:09:58.898
[USOPP, ZORO]
Huh?

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:00.466
[FISHBOY A]
That's Straw Hat Luffy!

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:03.936
He's human, and a pirate!
But on our side!

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.004
[FISHMAN F]
He showed up right when

00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:07.206
Princess Shirahoshi
called for him!

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:09.642
From the looks of things,
he's here to help Boss Jimbei

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:11.811
save the country
from Hordy's men!

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:14.013
[FISHMEN]
Straw Hat!

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:17.550
[ZEO chuckles] Isn't it
sweet how they cling to you?

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:20.987
But you've only delayed the
king's inevitable demise!

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.557
After all, you're
nothing but a human!

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.693
[BROOK] Your beauty outshines
all others, Princess.

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:30.229
[laughs]

00:10:30.262 --> 00:10:31.364
[BROOK]
Now that we've met,

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:34.100
would you be willing to
show me your panties? [groans]

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.402
You can't ask her that!

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:37.870
Then show me yours.

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:39.405
No way in hell!

00:10:39.438 --> 00:10:40.906
--[thud]
--[BROOK groans]

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:45.411
Okay. We're back! About time.

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:47.146
They're all ignoring you!

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:50.583
[ZEO groans] That's just because
I was using my inside voice!

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:52.184
[SANJI]
Nami-swan!

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:54.186
Now that I saved those
idiots from the palace,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.856
you have to love me! Right?

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:58.024
Whatever.

00:10:58.057 --> 00:10:59.892
Wait. He did what?

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:02.228
Liar! We got to
the exit ourselves!

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:03.429
[USOPP]
Mm.

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:04.430
Maybe.

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:07.266
However, you never would
have escaped without me!

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:08.367
That's a joke.

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:09.035
Right, you guys?

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:10.469
Wish I could say it was.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.972
But he left out the part
where Brook was a ghost.

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:14.173
What'd you say?

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:15.374
[BROOK]
You heard right.

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:16.942
Our escape was only possible

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:20.946
because of my splendid
new ability! [giggles]

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.382
[PAPPAGU screaming]

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:25.184
I need you to find the key!

00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:27.086
I mean, I need you
to find the sword!

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:28.220
[PAPPAGU screams]

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:29.755
Please, there's no time!

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:30.956
[PAPPAGU]
Stay away, ghost!

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:35.094
[PAPPAGU screaming]

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:36.429
[BROOK]
Pappagu!

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:38.264
[PAPPAGU screams]

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:39.398
[PAPPAGU]
Huh?

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.203
All right. That's weird.

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:47.139
How exactly does this
ghost know my name?

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:49.775
Come now. We're
friends! [laughs]

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:51.577
[PAPPAGU screams]
No we're not!

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.046
I don't have any friends
that are ghosts! Uh--

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.149
Wait. You're Bone
Daddy, aren't you?

00:11:57.183 --> 00:12:00.152
[laughing]

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.697
[USOPP gasps]
Oh, no! It's here!

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:14.066
What are you doing,
Brook? Hurry!

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.036
Before it's too late!

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:19.105
Real sorry for the wait.

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:20.172
[USOPP]
Oh, no biggie.

00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:23.743
[PAPPAGU gasps]
Here! Your sword!

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:37.289
Nice cut! Way to go!

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:39.992
[USOPP]
Heck yeah! We're outta here!

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.627
[ZORO]
Three-Sword Style!

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.795
Huh?

00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:47.867
[BOTH groan]

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:56.308
[ALL gasp]

00:12:57.376 --> 00:13:00.045
[USOPP groans]
Okay, that was way too much!

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.514
[ZORO]
You think?

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.751
[PAPPAGU]
I'm running out of strength!

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.553
[USOPP]
Gotta get a breath!

00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:08.487
[ZORO]
Damn!

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:10.756
[USOPP]
I'm gonna die!

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:15.161
[HOE clicks]

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:16.829
[CHOPPER]
Look! They're here!

00:13:16.862 --> 00:13:19.331
Hey! We came to get you!

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:21.367
[SANJI]
Great, they're still alive.

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:23.903
[BROOK]
It was very exciting.

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:24.870
[laughs]

00:13:24.904 --> 00:13:26.205
[CHOPPER]
It sounds like your new ability

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:27.840
is pretty amazing, Brook!

00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:29.809
I'm sure it'll come in handy.

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:32.311
[CHOPPER]
Anyway,

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:34.947
Luffy knocked their
captain out in one hit.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.817
Why don't they seem
more worried about that?

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:42.221
You're right. That's odd.

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:03.742
[NAMI]
Shirahoshi.

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:04.577
[gasps]

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.413
It's your mom's letter.
Here you go.

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:10.115
I can't tell you how
much this means to me.

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:13.018
I know it may look like an
ordinary piece of paper,

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:14.820
but it's this island's hope!

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:17.923
That's enough.
Weepyhoshi, it's not safe.

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:20.092
[JIMBEI]
Mm. He's right.

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:22.995
You weren't meant to be caught,
so you must leave.

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:25.664
Now. While you can.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:26.999
Wait, Luffy.

00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:29.034
What did you call me?

00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:29.969
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:33.572
Just now. It was
almost my name, but--

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:36.141
Yeah. I was wrong about you.

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:38.611
You're a wuss,
but more than just a crybaby.

00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:39.745
[gasps]

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:43.549
[LUFFY] So I'll call you
"Weepyhoshi." It's an upgrade.

00:14:43.582 --> 00:14:46.085
[ROBIN] When a person feels
as if they've been wronged,

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:49.788
well, then it's only natural
that they would turn to hate.

00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:51.423
That man.

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:55.527
[ROBIn]
Hordy is doing exactly that.

00:14:56.662 --> 00:14:59.331
[NAMI]
But you chose not to hate.

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:00.966
A coward wouldn't do that.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.169
Hardship has only made
you stronger in the end.

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:06.138
Nami is right.

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:07.840
You endured.

00:15:07.873 --> 00:15:10.042
Princess, I'm proud of you.

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:11.911
I appreciate the thought.

00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:14.580
But still, I feel like
I caused everyone trouble

00:15:14.613 --> 00:15:16.682
by keeping this
secret to myself.

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:18.784
I'm sorry. You're mistaken.

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:21.153
You've done quite well.

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:23.622
Your intentions were pure.

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:26.292
Just like those who
have come before you.

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:28.761
You can't tell them.

00:15:28.794 --> 00:15:30.863
You have to hold it in.

00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:32.598
Listen.

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:35.434
Don't become angry on my behalf.

00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:37.236
I don't want that.

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:41.307
[JIMBEI] Our heroes planted
a seed in your heart,

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.475
and it has blossomed
beautifully.

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:45.945
You have lived by
their example well.

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:48.881
If everyone else
thought the way you do,

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:51.350
then there would be
no more fighting,

00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:53.519
and the conflict between
Fishmen and humans

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:55.688
would be over, at last.

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:58.057
You may have suffered through
these past years alone,

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:01.193
but that doesn't make
that time meaningless.

00:16:01.226 --> 00:16:04.263
Singlehandedly,
you were a defender.

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:08.534
Protecting the virtues
of others day after day.

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:10.602
But today, we're here.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.705
We'll protect them for you.

00:16:31.557 --> 00:16:34.326
Thank... you...!

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:40.799
Thank you so much!

00:16:43.602 --> 00:16:45.537
She's still a crybaby.

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:47.306
That's for sure.

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:50.809
[FISHMAN G]
Straw Hat! Take 'em down!

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:57.182
[HORDY] I should've known
Vander Decken was gonna fail me.

00:16:57.216 --> 00:17:00.753
He couldn't even get rid
of one lousy princess.

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:02.187
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Captain Hordy!

00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:03.789
[ZEO]
It's as I thought.

00:17:03.822 --> 00:17:07.259
The Energy Steroid is still
coursing through his veins.

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:08.394
[DARUMA]
Given how much he took,

00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:10.763
I'd be surprised if it wasn't!

00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:13.165
He's back up! They're done for!

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:17.069
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES cheering]

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:18.470
[FISHMEN gasp]

00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:26.045
Her power is too great.

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:28.547
It really is the
stuff of legends.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.315
Once I found out it was real,

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:33.652
I knew I had to eliminate
her as soon as possible.

00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:37.890
But then, you got in my way.

00:17:37.923 --> 00:17:41.360
Admittedly, I should have
known something was wrong

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:44.296
when you were captured
without putting up a fight,

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:45.898
Jimbei.

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:50.736
You really like these
humans, don't you?

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:52.204
People like you are the worst.

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:54.540
You've completely
forgotten your pride!

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:57.576
See, you grew up with
Tiger in our district.

00:17:57.609 --> 00:17:59.344
And let's not forget Arlong.

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:01.246
He was like your brother.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.816
Both of them were beaten
or killed by humans!

00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:05.818
But instead of avenging them,

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:08.387
you went and got in
bed with the humans!

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.655
It's pathetic.

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:10.589
Jimbei.

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:12.991
Gutless! Like Neptune!

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:15.394
But soon, everything is
going to change.

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:17.196
Once I'm king, that is.

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:19.932
Hear that? I'll start
with the World Summit.

00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:22.568
That'll be the perfect place.

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:25.037
With every ruler in the
surface world in one place,

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.072
they'll be easy to kill.

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:32.177
Then, the whole world will learn
to fear our underwater kingdom.

00:18:34.713 --> 00:18:36.115
[HORDY]
Their kingdoms in disarray,

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:37.950
we'll drag the humans
into the depths

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:39.985
and enslave every last one!

00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:43.455
In time, there won't be a soul
left to stand against us.

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:46.125
And we will rule
the Great Pirate Era!

00:18:46.158 --> 00:18:48.327
[chuckles]

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.098
Oh, yes, you pirates will bow
the same as everybody else.

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:54.733
Just you wait.

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:55.934
You see?

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.170
These humans are more than
capable of holding their own,

00:18:58.203 --> 00:19:00.339
yet they kneel before me.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.374
That's right.

00:19:02.407 --> 00:19:06.078
In a moment, you'll be
just like them, Straw Hats!

00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:08.714
I'll be King of the Fishmen,
King of the Humans,

00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:11.049
and King of the Pirates!

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:13.652
Is that so?

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:17.589
[HORDY chuckles] And to think,
there're only ten of you here

00:19:17.623 --> 00:19:19.625
to stand in my way!

00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:23.929
What can you possibly do
when we're 100,000?!

00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:26.665
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES cheer]

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:29.101
Uh, how are they supposed
to fight all of them?

00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:31.270
Boss Jimbei's side
is too outnumbered.

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:32.804
I don't like these odds.

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:34.273
Are they gonna be okay?

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:36.241
They're the only
hope we have left.

00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:38.944
So if they lose,
Hordy takes everything!

00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:39.978
They must win.

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.013
Because if they don't,

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:43.482
that monster is gonna
take our homes away!

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:45.250
Fight! Boss Jimbei!

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:46.618
You got this, Straw Hat!

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:48.053
[FISHCHILDREN]
Straw Hat!

00:19:48.086 --> 00:19:50.989
Kill them! New Fishman Pirates!

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.991
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.394
[CHOPPER screams]
Here they come!

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:57.763
No way we can fight
this many at once!

00:19:57.796 --> 00:19:59.331
We're done for!

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:01.133
[PAPPAGU] This is exactly
the reason I don't like

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:03.535
hangin' out with you guys!

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:05.037
Before this begins,

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.206
it's been a pleasure
traveling with all of you.

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:09.374
Don't say that! Gah!

00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:11.677
[BROOK]
There are so many enemies! Wow!

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.880
If I try to count them all,
my eyes may pop out!

00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:16.949
Then again, I don't have eyes.

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:19.484
So they can't! [laughs]

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:21.153
Just 100,000?

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:23.622
That's nothing we
can't handle, right?

00:20:23.655 --> 00:20:24.957
Hey! Wait!

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.560
You're just saying that 'cause
you're hiding behind us!

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:29.928
Then here I go!

00:20:29.962 --> 00:20:31.296
It's time to shine!

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.099
Super Armored Me!

00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:35.801
All right!

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:38.604
Let's do this already.
Get over here!

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:40.405
In case you can't count,

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:43.141
we're each gonna have to take
down 10,000 of these guys

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:44.376
to win this fight.

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:47.946
They have numbers, but it
doesn't make them stronger.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.549
I mean, it's not like they're
Navy admirals or anything.

00:20:50.582 --> 00:20:52.451
So don't crap yourself.

00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:54.219
After these guys, you're next!

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:55.988
Number 10,001!

00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:58.991
[Bring it on! I can't wait!

00:20:59.024 --> 00:21:00.158
[ZORO, SANJI gasp]

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:03.729
[SANJI]
Hey, Luffy!

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:05.964
Oh, no.

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:07.566
Luffy?

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:11.136
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE K] Those
four million berries are mine!

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:12.638
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE L]
No, they're mine!

00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:14.439
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE M]
It's too easy!

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:17.976
[HORDY laughs]
Kill him!

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:27.519
[HORDY gasps]

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:34.393
[FISHMEN gasp]

00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:55.881
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE N yells]
What the hell just happened?!

00:22:12.264 --> 00:22:13.632
But he didn't do anything!

00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:15.467
And he still knocked
them all out!

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.036
Hey! Get up, guys! C'mon!

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.937
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE I]
Damn!

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.206
He took down half
of us in an instant!

00:22:21.239 --> 00:22:23.442
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE J]
That was 50,000 of our men!

00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:25.577
What did he even do?

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.045
Did everyone see that?

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:29.848
Yeah, but--I don't
know what it was.

00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:32.551
So much power, for one so young.

00:22:32.584 --> 00:22:35.887
Wait. Did the Straw Hat
guy really do that?

00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:37.823
Yeah! Too cool!

00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:39.458
[ROBIN]
That Haki!

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:42.094
That training paid off. I see.

00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:43.428
Unreal.

00:22:43.462 --> 00:22:45.964
I mean, Conqueror's Haki? Scary.

00:22:45.997 --> 00:22:48.400
Sure is. But I'd expect no less.

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:50.569
Otherwise, he couldn't
be my captain.

00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:53.105
Oh, my! Luffy!

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:55.073
[LUFFY]
Your name's Hordy, right?

00:22:55.107 --> 00:22:57.676
I'm about to kick your ass.

00:22:57.709 --> 00:23:00.145
You wanna become the king
of a country or whatever?

00:23:00.178 --> 00:23:02.080
Fine, I don't care.

00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:05.283
But King of the Pirates?

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:06.284
Nuh-uh.

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:08.053
That's my job!

00:23:12.457 --> 00:23:14.259
[NARRATOR]
Despite Luffy's display of Haki,

00:23:14.292 --> 00:23:17.362
the sheer number of Hordy's
forces proves overwhelming.

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:20.465
As the New Fishman Pirates
close in on Shirahoshi,

00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:22.901
Zoro and Sanji
launch an assault.

00:23:22.934 --> 00:23:25.337
With the last two years
still fresh in their minds,

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.739
the Straw Hats' training
is put to the test,

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:31.109
as they unleash a flurry of
fearsome new techniques.

00:23:31.143 --> 00:23:32.811
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.844 --> 00:23:35.046
"Deadly Attacks
One After Another!

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.416
Zoro and Sanji Join the Battle!"

00:23:37.449 --> 00:23:39.985
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
