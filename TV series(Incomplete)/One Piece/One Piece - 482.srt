1
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:36,223
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,026
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,263
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:45,099
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,935
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,470
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,439
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,342
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,044
they capture the
unwanted attention

10
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,479
of the World Government,

11
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,483
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,252
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,589
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:11,926
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,463
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,404
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest the of his crew,

17
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:27,508
Luffy has arrived at Marineford
to rescue his brother, Ace.

18
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,209
He breaks into the plaza and

19
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,478
eventually makes his
way to the scaffold!

20
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,348
There, with some unexpected
help from an old enemy,

21
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,917
Luffy finally frees Ace!

22
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,186
Then, the brothers
begin their escape

23
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,522
as Whitebeard gives
his sons a final order!

24
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,661
[WHITEBEARD]
Make no mistake.

25
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,664
I'm a relic of a bygone era.

26
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:56,403
Long have I sailed, but no ship
can carry me into the new age.

27
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,179
Let's finally
put an end to this!

28
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,952
[LUFFY] "The Power That Can
Burn Even Fire!

29
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,854
Akainu's Ruthless Pursuit!"

30
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,994
[MARINES screaming]

31
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,362
[MARINE AA]
Marineford's falling apart!

32
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:24,064
[MARINE BB]
Somebody stop Whitebeard!

33
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,970
Damn! At this rate, he's gonna
bring down the whole island!

34
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,944
[PIRATES]
Pops!

35
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,345
[HARUTA]
We came here as a family.

36
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,214
We should leave as one, too!

37
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,883
[PIRATES]
Yeah, Pops! Come with us!

38
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,055
You mean to disobey
your captain's order?

39
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,491
I told you fools to get away!

40
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,027
[PIRATES]
Pops, no!

41
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,429
All right! This might
be our only chance!

42
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,864
Hit Whitebeard with
all you've got!

43
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,307
[WHITEBEARD growls]

44
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,441
[MARINES yelling]

45
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,977
I won't do it!

46
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,980
Hey! Come on, we're better
off doing what Pops says!

47
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,115
Are you crazy?
Pops is our father!

48
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,383
I won't leave him here to die!

49
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,918
[PIRATE C, PIRATE AA]
Yeah, let go!

50
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,985
[PIRATE D]
Don't be stupid!

51
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,622
Do you think any of us
want to leave Pops behind?

52
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,623
[PIRATE E, PIRATE F]
Move!

53
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,525
[FOSSA] Bickering about
your own petty feelings

54
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,526
at a time like this.

55
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:28,329
That's the kind of stuff
Pops wouldn't stand for!

56
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:31,098
Can't you see that he's
trying to do what's best for us?

57
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:31,632
[PIRATES gasp]

58
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,935
[crying]

59
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,603
[PIRATES]
Sorry!

60
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,076
[PIRATE BB]
Everyone, get back on the ships!

61
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,512
Hey, Ace!

62
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,961
[PIRATE CC]
Come on! Hurry it up!

63
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,363
We're about to take off!

64
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:05,232
[PIRATES yelling]

65
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,305
Commander Marco,
let's head back!

66
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:14,941
[MARCO]
Pops...

67
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,579
[laughing]

68
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,148
You completely
ruined the Navy's plan!

69
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,249
Die!

70
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:25,286
Don't kill me! I just
want to leave this disaster!

71
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,922
You don't have to do this!
Sheath your sword!

72
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:28,656
[MARINE D grunts]

73
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,557
[MARINES]
Huh? What the...?

74
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,228
[MR.3 laughs] My exquisite
wax shell is impenetrable!

75
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:37,531
You will need more than a cheap
blade to pierce this carapace!

76
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,100
Damn it! More
Devil Fruit powers!

77
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,368
Figures.

78
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,071
No wonder he was able to protect
Fire Fist Ace on the scaffold.

79
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,407
He even blocked Fleet
Admiral Sengoku's attack!

80
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,610
Oh, uh, well, I wouldn't
say I'm that powerful.

81
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:53,047
My skillset is better
suited for the arts.

82
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,582
[yelps]

83
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,583
[MR.3]
Thank you for your time! Adieu!

84
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:05,326
[WHITEBEARD grunting]

85
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:08,362
Whitebeard... Unreal!
He oughta be dead.

86
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:11,865
What's it gonna take
to put this guy away?

87
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,035
[SENGOKU]
He no longer has to worry

88
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,438
about saving Fire Fist Ace.

89
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,240
Admiral, sir?

90
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,308
[SENGOKU]
So long as his men can escape,

91
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,979
he'll sink Marineford
and all of us with it.

92
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:28,282
He's prepared to die.
I've no doubt.

93
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,483
[GARP grunts]

94
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,489
Vice Admiral Garp! You okay?

95
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,092
[GARP] Whitebeard
thinks our era is over?

96
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,029
Yeah, the old man
is probably right.

97
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,265
[MAN AA] We still don't know
what happened to Whitebeard!

98
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,566
[MAN BB]
What about his allies?

99
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,834
Did he really
sell them out or what?

100
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,105
[MAN BB] This blackout's
getting ridiculous!

101
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,373
[WOMAN AA]
How long will we have to wait?

102
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,512
[MAN A] Ugh! If that stupid
clown didn't block our view

103
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,713
with that fat head of his,

104
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:03,116
then maybe we'd have a clue
what was actually going on!

105
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,220
[PRISONER I]
Is that who I think it is?

106
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,389
Can it really be
the renowned pirate,

107
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:09,556
Captain Buggy?

108
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,857
[BUGGY]
Huh?

109
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,195
I'm sorry did
someone say my name?

110
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,965
Weird. So, was he trying
to tell us something?

111
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,435
Perfect. How am I supposed to
write a story on the battle now?

112
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,905
What's wrong with their snails?
We don't got all day!

113
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,074
Really?

114
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,944
That piece of crap is
still hiding in its shell?

115
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:33,047
Come on! Get back
out here, Mr. Snail!

116
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,048
We still need your help!

117
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,450
Captain Buggy's ready
to defeat Whitebeard!

118
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,484
[snorts]

119
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,719
[BUGGY] Don't they
realize what they're saying?

120
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:42,323
Yeah, Whitebeard's wounded,
but he's tearing down buildings!

121
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,258
Just look at the bastard!

122
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,627
Why'd I have to go
and say I'd beat him?

123
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,263
These morons believe
anything you tell 'em!

124
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,633
It's their fault for feeding
my ego! I can't help it!

125
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,667
[PRISONER AA]
Lure it out!

126
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,203
We gotta showcase
Captain Buggy's awesomeness

127
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,072
for the entire world to see!

128
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,308
Bring it over here!
I'll just smash the shell open!

129
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,044
[PRISONER BB] Yeah!
One strong pound oughta do it!

130
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,046
[PRISONER CC] No, stick
your hand in there and yank!

131
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,348
[PRISONER DD]
Let's soak it in salt water!

132
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,949
Snails love that, right?

133
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,251
[PRISONER EE]
Good idea!

134
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:11,385
[PRISONER FF]
Let's do it!

135
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,988
[BUGGY] Quit messing with
the poor thing, you fools!

136
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,356
[PRISONERS]
Huh?

137
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,590
Just think about it.

138
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:19,193
It's not like he wants to be
here slaving away for the Navy,

139
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,129
getting stuck in their battles
and beaten up by guys like us.

140
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:25,032
He's just trying to do
his job in difficult times.

141
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,201
Filming a war like this
has gotta be traumatic.

142
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,436
So, relax and cut
him some slack!

143
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,872
No! How will you
broadcast your plan?

144
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,074
The "Captain Buggy Beats
Whitebeard Senseless

145
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,277
as the Entire World
is Watching Live" plan!

146
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,212
Yeah! Isn't that
what you wanted?

147
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,247
To stick it to
the Navy and Whitebeard

148
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,649
to prove that you're
the King of the Pirates?

149
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,485
I'm disappointed!
Seriously, Boss!

150
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:48,155
[BUGGY] Good grief! Sure,
they're loyal, and stupid,

151
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,224
but they're also a bunch
of hard-ass prisoners

152
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,192
who were locked
up in Impel Down!

153
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,328
I better not piss
them off too much!

154
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,062
[PRISONERS gasping]

155
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,029
[BUGGY]
Huh?

156
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,632
The Transponder Snail
came out on his own!

157
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,035
Wha...? Is he...

158
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,469
Is he crying?

159
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:03,637
[PRISONER C]
It's a miracle!

160
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,007
He must've been touched by
Captain Buggy's kind words!

161
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,075
[BOTH gasping]

162
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,310
Captain Buggy's compassion

163
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,579
isn't lost on even
the simplest of creatures!

164
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,247
He's truly amazing!

165
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,214
[PRISONERS gasp]

166
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:15,616
[PRISONERS]
We're flattered to be serving

167
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,484
such an inspiring leader.

168
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:20,087
Captain Buggy was meant
to conquer this world!

169
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,489
[BUGGY]
No, stupid escargot!

170
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,425
Why couldn't he just
stay in his shell?

171
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,994
Are you trying to get
Whitebeard to kill me?

172
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,896
Thanks, snail!

173
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,998
[PRISONER C]
Okay, let's try again!

174
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,499
[PRISONER GG]
Start by making a declaration

175
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:35,469
to conquer the world!
Whenever you're ready!

176
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,438
All right, you got this!

177
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,340
[PRISONER II]
Cue smoke! Lights are ready!

178
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,408
Start rolling, you guys!

179
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:45,045
[BUGGY]
Well, crap! No backing out now.

180
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,481
Here goes nothin', I guess!

181
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,951
Right! Come on! We're
starting the broadcast!

182
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,454
And make sure you capture the
moment that I kill Whitebeard,

183
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,989
'cause that's
totally gonna happen!

184
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:57,157
[PRISONERS]
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

185
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,225
[CROWD gasps]

186
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,360
Hey, look!

187
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:00,628
It's back!

188
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,695
[MAN CC]
But what's going on?

189
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:04,365
I-I can't make out anything
through that smoke!

190
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:08,068
So, did the Navy beat the
pirates, Whitebeard, and Ace?

191
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,970
[BUGGY]
Uh, um, uhh...

192
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,539
[PRISONER C] Transponder Snail,
go down a little!

193
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,107
[CROWD gasps]

194
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:19,213
Why hello, everybody!
Time for Captain Buggy!

195
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:20,614
[MAN A, MAN E yelp]

196
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,217
[CROWD]
This guy again?!

197
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,219
[PIRATE DD]
Get to the sea now!

198
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,487
Hurry up and on the ships,

199
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,489
we gotta make it back to
the New World, and fast!

200
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,226
[MARINE CC]
Don't let them get away!

201
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,228
Kill as many pirates as you can!

202
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:38,064
I'm the only pirate you
should be worrying about!

203
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,604
[PIRATE EE]
Commander Jozu!

204
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:44,939
[PIRATE FF]
He's in pretty bad shape,

205
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,173
but I think he can make it.

206
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:50,010
First we gotta get him outta
here to safety! Everyone, lift!

207
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,478
[PIRATES gasp]

208
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,348
Hey, Blenheim! Get over
here on the double!

[BLENHEIM grunts]

210
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,152
[IVANKOV grunts]
Hurry, Straw Boy!

211
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,287
It's time to make an
exit, on the double!

212
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,990
[LUFFY] Ace, let's go!
The old guy made up his mind.

213
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,566
I know. This is it.

214
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,634

words has passed my son...

[ACE panting]

223
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:17,364

Are you happy to have

226
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:26,073
this old fool as your father?

227
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,375
[ACE gasping]

228
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,315
[WHITEBEARD chuckles]
Ya got some fight left?

229
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:38,218
Look, I'm not gonna
kill you today. All right?

230
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,252
Don't fight it,

231
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,388
you're too valuable to
die in a place like this.

232
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:45,492
Run wild with us and
our flag will be yours.

233
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,562
And I will call you my son.

235
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,940

00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,545
Hey, what happened?

238
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,614
[MAN DD]
The scaffold was destroyed!

00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:41,715
[WOMAN BB]
They're in the plaza!

240
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:45,352
Was Fire Fist Ace executed?
Please say somethin'!

241
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,421
Shift the camera to Whitebeard!

242
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:50,491

[grunts]

244
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,460
[PRISONER JJ] Tell us,
Captain Buggy the Clown,

245
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,496
is it true you're going
to beat your fellow legend,

246
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,197
Captain Whitebeard?

247
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,366
And will you loudly
proclaim your stake as one of

248
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,404
the Four Emperors by carrying
the severed head of your victim?

249
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:06,340
I'm Captain Buggy, a legend!

250
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,375

Hey, say something else!

252
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:13,447
[PRISONER JJ] They got that part
already! Change it up a little!

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,049
[MAN EE]
Enough with Buggy!

254
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,318
Show us what's
happening at Marineford!

255
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,352
[CROWD]
Yeah!

256
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,554
[MAN FF] Come on,
who cares about this weirdo?

257
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,389
Get him outta the way!

258
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,226
[BUGGY] Okay, use that
filter! Nice! Very flashy!

259
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,494
[MAN GG]
What's he doing now?

260
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,396
[CROWD shouting]

261
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:34,101
Keep it up! We're almost there!

262
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,170
[PIRATE L yells]

263
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:38,906
[JIMBEI]
Ace! Luffy! Stay in front!

264
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,174
[LUFFY, ACE]
Huh?

265
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,576
They're specifically
targeting you two!

266
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,045
We cannot let the
old man waste his life.

267
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,281
He will not fall in vain!

268
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,115
[JIMBEI]
Farewell.

269
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:52,319
We've stolen a Navy ship!

270
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,554
Hop aboard!

271
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:55,222

[ACE, LUFFY, JIMBEI panting]

273
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:02,229
[AKAINU] Do they really think
they stand a chance of escaping?

274
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,931
How naive.

275
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,633
Admiral Sakazuki!

276
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,501
[AKAINU]
Move aside. I'll handle this.

00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:14,642

00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,379
Never mind that.

281
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:22,849
Just don't stop running
until you reach the ship!

282
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:28,289
[AKAINU] As soon as they rescued
Fire Fist Ace, they fled!

283
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:29,890
What a cowardly crew!

284
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,293
Just like their
washed-up captain!

285
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,394
[PIRATES]
What?

286
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:35,996
He's just trying to get
you riled up, don't listen!

287
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,400
Keep it moving. Don't fall
into his trap, you hear me?

288
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:42,369
Yeah, that old man, huh?

289
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,139
Some captain he is.

290
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,341
It's not your fault...

291
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,142
That's just Whitebeard.

292
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,646
A washed-up failure!

293
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,081
[ACE gasps]

294
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,249
[ACE growls]

295
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:56,216
Ace!

296
00:16:56,249 --> 00:17:00,487
[panting]

297
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,623
A failure?

298
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,090
Huh?

299
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,931
Take it back or else.

300
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,367
Ace! No! Don't!
Just keep moving!

301
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,136
He can say whatever
he wants, let's go!

302
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:20,107
No one gets away
with mocking Pops!

303
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,442
Stop!

304
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:22,842
Take it back?

305
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,213
It's not an insult,
it's the truth.

306
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:29,049
Let me tell you a story.

307
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,285
Your father conquered
the Grand Line,

308
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:34,321
something no other pirate
has ever accomplished.

309
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:37,324
After that, he opened the
door to the Great Pirate Era

310
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,559
by sacrificing his own life.

311
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,297
I hate to say it,
being a Navy admiral,

312
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,599
but he was King of the Pirates!

313
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,034
No question.

314
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:52,139
Keeping all that in mind,
Whitebeard has failed.

315
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:55,242
His lack of ambition meant
he'd never be king of anything

316
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,611
but you simple-minded cronies.

317
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:01,081
Once he brainwashed enough of
you into doing his dirty work,

318
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,050
he got lazy.

319
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,919
Every now and then,
you'll find someone

320
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:06,654
who paints him as a peacekeeper.

321
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:09,456
"Start trouble here and
Whitebeard will come runnin',"

322
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:10,557
they say.

323
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,895
Heh. Empty boasts to keep
idiots like you fearful.

324
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:19,667
You call him hero, when he's
nothing but a coward.

325
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,468
When Gold Roger was around,

326
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,938
Whitebeard always
had second billing.

327
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:27,474
Yet even after Roger's death,
he couldn't become King.

328
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:30,945
So there it is, the tale of
your father's whipping boy:

329
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:32,880
The Great Failure Whitebeard!

330
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:36,850
Soon enough, he'll be dead,
and no one will remember him.

331
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,287
[AKAINU] I can't help but
feel sorry for the man,

332
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,656
and all you punks call
him your "Pops."

333
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,025
Did you make this
fake family to humor him

334
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:46,660
or are you just as deluded?

335
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,295
Shut it.

336
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,364
[AKAINU]
He sailed the seas for years,

337
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:54,134
couldn't amount to anything,
amassed an army of losers,

338
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:57,104
and in the end was even stabbed
by one of his own "sons"

339
00:18:57,137 --> 00:19:00,207
who put more stock in
my word than his own.

340
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,611
And still, he'll die
to protect that man.

341
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:07,280
Have you ever heard
of a more pathetic life?

342
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,488
That's enough!

343
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,257
Leave him! Run!

344
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,058
[PIRATES]
Ace!

345
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:20,961
You're wrong.

346
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,964
There's nothing fake
about the family he gave us.

347
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,100
But I wouldn't expect
a heartless bastard

348
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:29,270
like you to appreciate that.

349
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:31,205
Like I said,
he convinced you punks

350
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,540
you meant something
to the world!

351
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:36,143
But your kind doesn't
deserve a home,

352
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,478
you deserve the gallows.

353
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:38,545
Can it!

354
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:42,182
You know it's true!
You'll all die as failures,

355
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,385
and Whitebeard's nothing
but a lonely old fool!

356
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:46,487
Whitebeard is the greatest
pirate who ever lived,

357
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,988
you hear me?!

358
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:55,362
You don't know anything
about the man who saved my life!

359
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,431
[PIRATES]
Get away from him, Ace!

360
00:19:57,464 --> 00:20:01,234
This is his era!
Don't you forget it!

361
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,306
[ACE yelling]

362
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,874
[yelling]

363
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,879
[yelling]

364
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:15,249
Your "Pops" will end up
the same as you, boy--

365
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:18,052
dead, and by my hand!

366
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:21,922
[ACE yelling]

367
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,960
How? Did he burn him?

368
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:35,302
Thanks to your Logia-Type fruit,
you're not used to being hurt.

369
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,938
It's made you too cocky.

370
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,940
You may be made of fire,

371
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:43,077
but my magma burns
even hotter than that!

372
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,148
Just like Whitebeard,
second rate till the bitter end.

373
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:49,116
Ace!

374
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:50,383
[LUFFY gasps]

375
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,387
[JIMBEI]
Luffy, stay out of harm's way!

376
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,222
You're in no
condition to battle!

377
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:58,459
[panting]

378
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:00,995
Ace's Vivre Card!

379
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:02,630
[LUFFY gasps]

380
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:04,598
[AKAINU] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

381
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:07,001
and Dragon, the revolutionary...

382
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:09,370
To think that the two of
you were adopted brothers

383
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:11,137
all these years.

384
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:15,209
What a victory it'd be
to end both bloodlines.

385
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:17,111
Everyone else can escape.

386
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:20,614
The two of you are the
only targets I'm after!

387
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,116
Say goodbye.

388
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:25,619
[gasps]

389
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,153
[ACE]
Wait!

390
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,925
[ACE]
Luffy!

391
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,859
[gasps]

392
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,945
[LOLA]
This is definitely a Vivre Card,

393
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:27,481
but there's something
I neglected to tell you before.

394
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:31,051
The life force of the owner
is also reflected on the paper.

395
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:34,922
Does this belong
to someone close to you?

396
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:37,190
[LUFFY]
Yeah! It's my big brother's.

397
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:41,428
Now, you hang on
to that, always.

398
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:45,565
That scrap of paper's going
to reunite us some day.

399
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:50,204
[coughs]

400
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:52,472
[gasps]

401
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:11,659
[NARRATOR] Ace protects his
brother from Akainu,

402
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:14,395
but suffers a mortal
blow in the process.

403
00:23:14,428 --> 00:23:17,131
Jimbei and the Whitebeard
Pirates rush to his aid,

404
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:19,400
but soon realize
he is far beyond help.

405
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:21,201
As Ace takes his final breaths,

406
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:24,138
he gives a heartfelt
message to his comrades.

407
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:26,073
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

408
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:27,408
"Looking for the Answer!

409
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:30,411
Fire Fist Ace Dies
on the Battlefield!"

410
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:33,113
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
