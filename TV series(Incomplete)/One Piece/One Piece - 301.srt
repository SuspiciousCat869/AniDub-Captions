1
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,258
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:41,128
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,431
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:49,402
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,139
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,240
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,610
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,079
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,316
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,552
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,755
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:22,402
Demon Aura Nine-Sword
Style Asura!

13
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,140
Sky Slicer!

14
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,113
[ZORO]
You did well.

15
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,348
I commend you!

16
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,517
Suffering is welcome on
the path to bloodshed!

17
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,361
Asura Silver Mist!

18
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,634
[LUFFY]
Second Gear.

19
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,305
Jet Whip!

20
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,149
[LUCCI]
Shave! Finger Pistol!

21
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,620
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

22
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,121
[LUCCI]
Iron Body!

23
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,157
...Jet Bazooka!

24
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,831
Franky!

25
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,233
You gotta save her!

26
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:30,403
Just super leave it to me!

27
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,739
[SPANDAM]
Stupid woman!

28
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,640
Don't you get it?

29
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:33,807
This is useless!

30
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,043
How many times do
I have to tell you?

31
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:39,346
There's no hope for you
so just give it up now!

32
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,081
[ROBIN]
I'm not going anywhere!

33
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,050
They're coming!

34
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,585
They're all coming to rescue me!

35
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,157
[LUFFY]
"Spandam Frightened!

36
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,125
The Hero on the Tower of Law."

37
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,491
Hey! Look! They're opening!

38
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,493
The Gates of Justice
are really opening!

39
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,294
You're right!

40
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,261
In all my years here,

41
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:31,064
this is the first time
it's ever happened!

42
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,736
[MARINES] I've never even heard
of it happening before!

43
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,338
[MARINES] They must be
letting the battleships

44
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:39,106
from Headquarters through.

45
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,075
[MARINES] The Buster Call's
about to let loose!

46
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,747
Ah, crap.

47
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,115
I don't like this.

48
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,050
Granny Kokoro said
the Gates of Justice

49
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,086
never open all
the way like that.

50
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:55,122
[KIWI] This Buster Call
thing must be really bad.

51
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,658
Even the Marines are in
a panic to get out of here!

52
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,361
[MOZU] The Straw Hats picked
a fight with the whole world.

53
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:01,195
They might really burn

54
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,230
the whole island
down to get at them.

55
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,266
[TILESTONE]
Those bastards!

56
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:08,035
Hang in there, Bro! Don't die!

57
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,637
Yeah!

58
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,804
You too, Straw Hat!

59
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,273
Good luck!

60
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,089
Robin'll be fine.

61
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,691
I know Franky
can take care of her.

62
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,428
[LUCCI]
I was careless.

63
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:38,098
This new power of his
took me by surprise.

64
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,235
Whatever you're doing
seems to be taking its toll.

65
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,136
Shame.

66
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,571
The fight was just
getting interesting.

67
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,245
[LUFFY]
I don't care what happens,

68
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:54,748
as long as I can beat you.

69
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,753
I see. How stubborn.

70
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,425
Almost there!

71
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,626
Don't you dare
leave yet, Nico Robin!

72
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,730
Would you look at yourself?

73
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:14,134
I've never seen such
a pathetic sight! Really!

74
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,670
Now that's enough.

75
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:20,307
Stand up! Stand up, damn it!

76
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,276
Gimme a break!

77
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,044
The gate is right over there!

78
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,546
We're so close.
It's so annoying!

79
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,056
[MARINE]
Guards, onto the bridge!

80
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,290
[MARINES]
Yes sir!

81
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,667
All right, men. Ready? Good.

82
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,237
Because Chief Spandam
is on his way as we speak.

83
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,373
He's delivering an
especially heinous criminal

84
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,608
across the bridge
from the Tower of Law.

85
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,043
This doesn't happen often,

86
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,178
so I want all Marines
from the escort ships

87
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,115
and all guards from the
gate here in top form!

88
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,717
Give him the best
damned salute you've got!

89
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,596
[SPANDAM]
Would you look at that!

90
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,798
All lined up and ready to sail!

91
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,333
Not a thing left to stop me!

92
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,373
Oh, I almost forgot.

93
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:30,678
There's a surprise waiting
for your little friends.

94
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,613
You see, before we
crossed the bridge,

95
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,249
I set up a landmine at
the top of those stairs

96
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,417
right over there.

97
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,785
So, in the unlikely
event that someone

98
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,720
actually does come to save you,

99
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:43,791
they and the stairs
will both go boom!

100
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:46,694
Quite the elegant solution,
don't you think?

101
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,662
Well, I'm excited at least.

102
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,598
Though I suppose neither of us

103
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,266
should get our
hopes up too much,

104
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,801
seeing as how
no one will be coming

105
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,036
to help you in the first place.

106
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,711
[ROBIN]
I won't go through that gate.

107
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,679
[SPANDAM]
What?

108
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,490
I still believe they'll
come to save me.

109
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,058
They're not coming, okay?

110
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,693
Jeez! Shut up!

111
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,827
They'll be burned to a crisp

112
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:23,664
just like everything else
in the Buster Call's path.

113
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,165
You got that?

114
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,401
Rather convenient, really!

115
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,036
Every humiliation I've suffered,

116
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,704
including them
shooting down our flag

117
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,106
will be erased as well!

118
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,444
Just like before, 20 years ago,

119
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:40,547
when that marine giant
attacked us in Ohara.

120
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,284
Now it's time to walk!

121
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:46,353
That means on your
own two feet, damn it!

122
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,521
[ROBIN]
Saul.

123
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:51,691
Hurry up!

124
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,261
Are you okay, Chief?

125
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,062
Do you need help?

126
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,164
No, I don't need
any help, damn it!

127
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,599
I'm a friggin hero!

128
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,801
If you thought I didn't
know anything about that,

129
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,370
then you're dead wrong!

130
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,439
Your old friend Jaguar D. Saul

131
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,142
was a Vice Admiral
before he betrayed us.

132
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:10,578
Your mother, Olvia,
was an archaeologist.

133
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:14,381
And I know about your
hometown of Ohara as well.

134
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,685
Quite the tragic tale, isn't it?

135
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,420
And why do I know all this?

136
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,121
Well, it's quite simple.

137
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,691
Because the man who
commanded the raid on Ohara,

138
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,392
uncovered their crimes,

139
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,629
then blew the island to
smithereens with a Buster Call,

140
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,732
was the Chief of
CP9 who preceded me.

141
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:36,236
Otherwise known as
my father, Spandine!

142
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,277
Well, scholars of Ohara.

143
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,280
I'm afraid your death sentence
has already been decided.

144
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:50,784
Kill him!

145
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,596
Professor!

146
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,034
[ELDER STAR B]
You left us no choice.

147
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,506
Ohara knows too much.

148
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,476
I invoke the Buster Call!

149
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,143
And that's a wrap.

150
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:30,423
Hurry. Take her and go, Saul.

151
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,793
Are you sure?

152
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,294
Yeah.

153
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:35,362
Stop it!

154
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:40,100
I wanna stay with
you! Mommy! No!

155
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:44,505
[OLVIA] I was happy to hear
you call me that again.

156
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,240
Thank you.

157
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:49,076
From now on,
for my sake as well--

158
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,645
You must live, Robin!

159
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,254
At the time, they thought

160
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:03,591
that everyone in Ohara
had been nicely eliminated.

161
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:06,527
But they found out later
that one little brat

162
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,562
had slipped through
their fingers.

163
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:11,332
So, how was it?

164
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:13,734
Running from one money-grubbing
adult to the next,

165
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:17,104
hoping you weren't
either killed or sold out?

166
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:21,375
Not a single person
you could trust,

167
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,743
no matter where you went.

168
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,179
Nowhere to lay your
little head down in peace.

169
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,647
Nothing to eat.

170
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,217
What a vile and wretched
existence you've had.

171
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,454
Why it's too appalling
to even think about.

172
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,490
Sad enough to make you cry, huh?

173
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,692
20 years ago, my old man

174
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,362
put that bounty
on your little head.

175
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:43,230
All for world peace!

176
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:47,267
Show some gratitude, will you?

177
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,373
Now we finally have
our happy ending.

178
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:54,375
The son completes the father's
crusade

179
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,677
against the devils of
Ohara, and the wrongs

180
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,180
of 20 years ago have
been made right at last!

181
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,250
Ohara is dead!

182
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,520
Don't cry, Robin! Be proud!

183
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,791
Your mamma's a wonderful woman!

184
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,693
Ohara's a wonderful place!

185
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,828
You gotta remember that!

186
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,097
It's up to you to
pass it on, okay?

187
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,067
Ohara was so brave they
fought against the whole world!

188
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,150
Ohara won't die as long I live!

189
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:36,984
Yeah?

190
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:41,121
And how long is
that gonna be? Huh?

191
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:51,431
Whoa! It went off!

192
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,340
[SPANDAM]
C-Cutty Flam!?

193
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:01,175
What is he doing here?

194
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,543
Well, no harm done.

195
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:05,045
He fell for the landmine. Idiot!

196
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,546
Serves you right!

197
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,584
[ROBIN]
He came to rescue me.

198
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,353
Still, that was close.

199
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:15,121
It's a good thing
I had my backup plan.

200
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,290
Come on, let's go!

201
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:21,228
[ROBIN]
I'm so angry I can't even speak.

202
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,430
All right, marines, set sail!

203
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,165
We're getting out of here now!

204
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,600
Understood, sir.

205
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:27,768
Everyone, move!

206
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,336
Yes sir!

207
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,405
[ROBIN] I can't hold
back the tears anymore.

208
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,745
Watch carefully, men!

209
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:39,179
Because you're about to witness

210
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,448
the first step of a
hero that is destined

211
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,084
to go down in history!

212
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,113
[SPANDAM]
Watch carefully, men!

213
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,415
Because you're about to witness

214
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,650
the first step of a
hero that is destined

215
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,419
to go down in history!

216
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:26,794
Are you okay, Chief?

217
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,329
What happened?

218
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,230
He was hit! We're under attack!

219
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,665
There's no one on
the bridge but us!

220
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,701
No, they must be
hiding somewhere!

221
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:35,402
Everyone start searching!

222
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,137
But where?

223
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,183
Hey! What's wrong with you?

224
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,552
Fight back! Don't
just stand there!

225
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:52,486
We're trying, sir,

226
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,255
but we don't know
where the enemy's at!

227
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,526
There!

228
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,310
Don't look back, just go!

229
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:19,079
If you say on this
island, you'll die!

230
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,282
Take my raft and go out to sea!

231
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,783
But what about you?

232
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,785
He's got me, little lady.

233
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:28,122
I'm afraid this is
the end. Hurry!

234
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:28,822
No!

235
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,824
Everybody I care about is here!

236
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,693
Now you listen to me.

237
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,763
You may be lonely at first.

238
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:39,633
But one day you'll
find true friends.

239
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:43,537
True friends?

240
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,042
Yeah, the sea's a
vast place, so I guarantee.

241
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:51,111
Someday you'll find friends

242
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,680
who won't ever leave you!

243
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:54,248
No matter who you are,

244
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:57,751
ain't no one born into
this world to be alone!

245
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,456
It's time to go, Robin.

246
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:03,724
This is goodbye!

247
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:06,427
When things are bad,
do like I taught you.

248
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,395
You know the laugh, don't you?

249
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,763
Look out! He's behind you!

250
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:13,133
Dereshishishishi...

251
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,502
Now. Ice Time.

252
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,138
Saul, no!

253
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,407
Dereshishishishi...

254
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,410
Your friends are out there
at sea waiting for you, Robin.

255
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:26,046
All you gotta do is find them!

256
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:33,119
[SAUL] Share your life with
them, and never let them go.

257
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,599
[MARINE]
Chief, over there!

258
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:53,507
What? Over where?

259
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,577
[MARINE] He's standing on
top of the Tower of Law!

260
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,279
What's he doing up there?

261
00:17:58,312 --> 00:17:59,413
It's so far away!

262
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,648
How the hell's he hitting us?

263
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:08,789
[USOPP]
Shing!

264
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,491
[MARINE U]
Is he using a slingshot?

265
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,558
[MARINE V]
This guy's a monster!

266
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,460
The wind's blowing like crazy

267
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,095
and he's all the way over there,

268
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:18,232
but he's still hitting
his mark every time!

269
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,166
Thank you, Long Nose.

270
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,769
Bam! Eat that!

271
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:25,539
Our sniper is number 1!

272
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,675
Serves you right, bastards!

273
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,643
C'mon Robin, run!

274
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,612
I could do without
the singing, I think.

275
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,152
Chief!

276
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,190
Damn it!

277
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,059
What are you idiots doing?

278
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:46,760
Shoot that guy already!

279
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:47,827
We're trying, sir,

280
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,197
but he's too far away
for our bullets to reach,

281
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,299
let alone actually hit him.

282
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,133
I hate to say it,

283
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,435
but he's got us
totally outclassed!

284
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,271
Nico Robin is getting away!

285
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:00,207
Then stop her! Shoot her down!

286
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,642
Sir!

287
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:04,678
Shoot her just dead
enough to keep her alive!

288
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:19,793
Fire!

289
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,531
[MARINE]
Who the hell is that?

290
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,201
Franky.

291
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:04,772
Bullets are no problem
when you're made of iron.

292
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:08,475
But that landmine
wasn't very nice, Spanda.

293
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,377
Franky!

294
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,580
Come in Franky, do you read me?

295
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:14,381
This is Sniper King.

296
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,348
Huh?

297
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,184
Yeah, I can read you
loud and clear, but--

298
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,118
How?

299
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:19,720
I got the snail from Nami.

300
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:20,888
Anyway, turn around.

301
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:23,591
There should be a red bundle
on the ground next to you.

302
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:27,061
Red bundle? Oh, I see it.

303
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:29,229
Good. It has two keys inside.

304
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:32,099
Together with the ones you have,
that should be all of them.

305
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:35,169
How did they get the keys?

306
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:38,806
And my mission is complete.

307
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:41,074
Nice work.

308
00:20:42,276 --> 00:20:44,411
All right, then. Let's go.

309
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:47,047
Number one. Number three.

310
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,517
Number four. Nope. Number five!

311
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,353
We got it!

312
00:20:58,158 --> 00:20:58,825
No way!

313
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:01,061
This can't be happening to me!

314
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,364
[FRANKY]
Whoa! Hold on.

315
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,099
We're not in the clear yet.

316
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:10,170
But wait-- that
means--They really did it?

317
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:14,374
A bunch of useless pirates
beat every last member of CP9?

318
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,417
No, that can't be right!

319
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,819
They must've just stolen
the keys and run away!

320
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,755
Buncha cheaters!

321
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,490
Okay, we got it!

322
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,225
Hey! You hear me?

323
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:34,228
We got the handcuffs
off Robin, no problem!

324
00:21:34,261 --> 00:21:35,663
Yes!

325
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:36,797
[ROBIN]
Thank you, Long Nose.

326
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,399
That was wonderful.

327
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,334
[USOPP]
It was the least I could do.

328
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,303
The true heroes are those

329
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:44,572
who fought to retrieve
those keys from the enemy.

330
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:47,274
The Straw Hats will be
proud to have you back.

331
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,342
Hold your head up high

332
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,743
and meet them with a smile

333
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,112
when all of this has ended!

334
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,180
Right.

335
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:56,483
Heh.

336
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,518
Now Seis Fleurs!

337
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,188
Huh? What the--?

338
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:02,455
[ROBIN]
Slap!

339
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:14,267
[ROBIN] I've been waiting
a long time to do this.

340
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:29,516
[MARINES]
Are you okay, Chief?

341
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:30,818
All right. Let's move!

342
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,419
Get your asses over here!

343
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,221
I'll get everything
ready for ya.

344
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:35,322
We're gonna bail!

345
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,257
[USOPP]
Roger!

346
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,361
[SANJI] Get down here
already, Sniper King!

347
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:41,462
[MARINE BB]
The prisoner's escaped

348
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:43,264
from the Sea Prism
Stone Handcuffs!

349
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:45,432
Regroup and recapture her!

350
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:50,537
[USOPP] Everything went
according to my plan.

351
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,708
[squeaky, squealing noise]

352
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,276
[USOPP]
What's that?

353
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,248
I swear I heard something.

354
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:15,629
[LUCCI] It's obvious that you're
pushing your body too far.

355
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,631
And I doubt that you
could take much more.

356
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:19,166
You're shortening
your own lifespan

357
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:21,368
just for a few
minutes of strength.

358
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,203
[LUFFY] It's better than
letting you take away

359
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,638
everything I care about.

360
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:27,441
I'll do anything to keep
that from happening!

361
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:29,176
On the next One Piece:

362
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:30,177
"Robin Freed!

363
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,514
Luffy Vs. Lucci, Showdown
between Leaders."

364
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:36,116
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
