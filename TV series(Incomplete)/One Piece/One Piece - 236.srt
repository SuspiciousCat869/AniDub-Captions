1
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,418
I won't let them take
the Merry away from me!

2
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,086
This is stupid.

3
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,688
You got fooled by
a bunch of salesmen

4
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,123
trying to pawn
off a used boat.

5
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,592
The Luffy I know
wouldn't cave in

6
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,227
to some sales pitch
from a total stranger!

7
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,296
He'd believe in the
strength of the Merry

8
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,198
and the strength of his crew!

9
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,267
But here you are acting
like you know everything

10
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,336
and ignoring your friends!

11
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,172
I can't believe that's the kind
of captain you turned out to be!

12
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,541
I thought you were
better than that!

13
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,743
You're not being fair,
Usopp. Luffy felt the--

14
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:26,413
You stay out of this!
It was my call. I stand by it.

15
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,082
There's nothing you can do.

16
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,584
We're getting a new ship
whether you like it or not.

17
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,753
This is the end of
the road for the Merry!

18
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:33,654
[USOPP] I know
you're always trying

19
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,189
to think about the future,

20
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,458
but not everyone on
this crew is like that!

21
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,693
I see the Merry as one
of our friends, got it?

22
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,695
And I won't abandon
her when she's hurt!

23
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,831
[LUFFY] Don't be stupid!
Even if she is a friend,

24
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,466
that doesn't mean
she's a person!

25
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,400
[USOPP]
She is to me!

26
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,102
And she still has
the strength to live!

27
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,336
But you wouldn't
appreciate that,

28
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,672
'cause all you care about is
getting a new ship to play with!

29
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,540
[SANJI] All right,
that's enough, both of you!

30
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,676
Just calm down and we
can settle this later!

31
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,111
[LUFFY]
Would you listen to yourself?!

32
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,078
Luffy!

33
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,213
[LUFFY] Don't act like
you're the only one

34
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,649
who's torn up about this.
We all feel the same way!

35
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,616
If that was true,

36
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,485
then you wouldn't be
looking for a new ship!

37
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,619
All right, fine!

38
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,321
If you don't like the way
your captain does things,

39
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,623
why don't you go
ahead and get off--

40
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:20,267
[CHOPPER]
Sanji!

41
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,636
This is going way too far!

42
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,572
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

43
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:25,606
If you don't watch it,

44
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,008
you're gonna say something
you can't take back!

45
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:38,152
Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't
know what I was thinking.

46
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,087
[USOPP] You don't
have to apologize.

47
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,289
'Cause that's how you
really feel, isn't it?

48
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,090
That's not true!

49
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,795
Just get rid of
your dead weight

50
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:51,832
and move on before
they can slow you down.

51
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:54,668
[USOPP] If you're gonna
throw away the Merry,

52
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:59,273
might as well
throw away me, too.

53
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,376
[USOPP] You don't want weak
people on your crew, do you?

54
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,478
Luffy, I still believe that

55
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,648
you'll be the King
of Pirates one day.

56
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:13,087
But as for me, I'm just lucky
I was able to make it this far.

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,390
[SANJI]
Hey! Usopp, where're you going?

58
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,493
[USOPP] Wherever
I go, it's my business.

59
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,529
It has nothing to
do with you anymore.

60
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,499
I'm leaving the crew.
This is goodbye.

61
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,000
[NAMI]
Usopp!

62
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,071
Get back here!
It shouldn't be like this!

63
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:38,379
C'mon! We can talk!

64
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:42,182
[USOPP] Luffy, I'm sorry
I can't follow you anymore.

65
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,387
And I'm sorry I was a
pain 'til the bitter end.

66
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,821
I know you're the
captain of this ship,

67
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,624
so the Merry belongs to you.

68
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:56,096
That's why I want you to
fight me, Monkey D. Luffy.

69
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,303
[USOPP]
I challenge you to a duel!

70
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,277
At ten o'clock tonight.

71
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,381
I'll be back. So you better
be ready for a fight, Captain.

72
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,450
I can't stop you from
destroying your own ship

73
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:20,254
but if I win I'm taking
the Merry and leaving.

74
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,455
Either way,

75
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,758
when we're done, the last
bond between us will be broken.

76
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:36,570
[LUFFY]

77
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,044
I am Usopp, Leader of the
invincible nation of pirates

78
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,579
who reign over this island!

79
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,348
You stand before
a living legend,

80
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,817
the most revered
pirate who ever lived!

81
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,687
I am the great Captain Usopp!

82
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,091
Hahahahahah!
That's pretty cool!

83
00:05:57,124 --> 00:06:00,060
Shut your mouth,
or I'll shut it for you!

84
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,300
[USOPP] I'm a proud man
and I won't stand for it!

85
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,668
This is your last warning!

86
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,037
Or you'll get to see
why they call me--

87
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,374
"Proud Usopp," and
not "Pushover Usopp"!

88
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:14,808
You guys take care!

89
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,677
I hope we'll meet
again sometime!

90
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,512
[LUFFY]
How come?!

91
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,482
Well because I... are you
antisocial or something?

92
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,350
I'm taking off for
life on the high seas

93
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,486
and I hope that we'll eventually
meet again that's all.

94
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,755
What are you talking
about? Get on already!

95
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,290
Huh?!

96
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:32,793
We're friends.
Right? So get on.

97
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,663
[USOPP]
This is it.

98
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:38,132
I'm really a Pirate Captain now!

99
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:41,368
[LUFFY] Don't be stupid
Usopp! I'm the Captain!

100
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,583
[LUFFY] So you didn't lose
your nerve after all.

101
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,586
No matter how this battle
ends, you can't regret it.

102
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,455
This is exactly
what you asked for.

103
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,425
That's perfect.
Don't go easy on me.

104
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,527
I won't be the
underdog this time.

105
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,430
In fact. I've already figured
out a way to defeat you.

106
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:17,037
Shouldn't we stop this?
Usopp's injuries are pretty bad!

107
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,273
If you can't stand to
watch, then go inside.

108
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,484
[LUFFY]
Make no mistake,

109
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,821
I'm not like any opponent
you've faced before.

110
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,723
We've been friends
a long time.

111
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,592
I know all your powers,
all your strengths,

112
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,527
and all of your weaknesses!

113
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,798
But there's something
you don't know about me.

114
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,469
I have 8 thousand
men on my side!

115
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:52,406
If you don't surrender now,
I'll order them to attack!

116
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,142
What?! Why didn't
he tell me?!

117
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,044
Seriously,
just go inside.

118
00:07:57,077 --> 00:08:00,080
If you're gonna fight, then
at least take this seriously!

119
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,583
Usopp Voodoo!

120
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:06,220
You have razor-sharp needles
stuck between all of your teeth!

121
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:09,223
[CHOPPER] Ahh!
It hurts just to imagine that!

122
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,758
[ZORO]
I'm telling you, go inside.

123
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,693
You've got
prickly cactus spines.

124
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,361
Under your finger--

125
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:19,299
Gum-Gum Pistol!

126
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,105
What happened?

127
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:31,045
Waaaaah!
Usopp, please don't die!

128
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:34,080
Special Attack
Ketchup Star!

129
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,383
Pity for your enemy?

130
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,353
That's awful arrogant,
don't you think?

131
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,353
Flash Dial!

132
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,495
Now Special Attack: Egg Star!

133
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,298
Again! Again!

134
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,732
Again!

135
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,204
It stinks! They're rotten!

136
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,341
Damn it! Would you stop
messing around already?!

137
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,176
[USOPP]
You think this is a joke, huh?

138
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,377
Cause I'm dead serious!

139
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,244
Oh yeah?

140
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,480
That's right!
This is the way I fight!

141
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:09,649
Careful, that gaping mouth
of yours is gonna get burned!

142
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,357
Special Attack Tabasco Star!

143
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,293
[LUFFY]
Hot!!!

144
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,428
[USOPP] I wouldn't jump around
too much if I were you!

145
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,531
'Cause the whole
battlefield is Caltrop Hell!

146
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,336
Ow!

147
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,304
He's controlling the fight!

148
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,642
Listen, Luffy.
You can pity me if you want,

149
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,244
but I'm gonna beat you
and take the Merry with me!

150
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,646
And I don't care what it takes!

151
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,188
Usopp.

152
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,690
[USOPP]
Special Attack! Pepper Star!

153
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,427
[sneezes]

154
00:09:56,363 --> 00:10:00,500
[sneezes]

155
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,469
Like I said, I know you.

156
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:05,305
So I know which attacks
are gonna work the best!

157
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:15,149
[LUFFY]
Damn it. This stuff stinks.

158
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,618
My mouth is burning.

159
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:18,619
And it hurts!

160
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,721
I'm not gonna give you
an inch, you hear me?

161
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:24,257
Special Attack
Shuriken Shooting Stars!

162
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,435
Smoke?

163
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,073
[USOPP]
I'm using a Breath Dial.

164
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,777
You didn't notice the smell
because of the rotten eggs.

165
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:25,151
And now you're completely
surrounded by gas.

166
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:27,821
Gas?

167
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,657
Don't tell me, he--

168
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,625
Sorry.

169
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,494
Flame Star!

170
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,108
That one's gonna sting!

171
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,250
Luffy! Usopp!

172
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:08,495
[USOPP]
I am Usopp...

173
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,264
Leader of the invincible
nation of pirates

174
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,432
who reign over this island!

175
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,169
You stand before
a living legend,

176
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,271
the most revered
pirate who ever lived!

177
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,506
I am the great Captain Usopp!

178
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,750
[LUFFY] Hahahahahah!
That's pretty cool!

179
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,453
Shut your mouth,
or I'll shut it for you!

180
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,088
[LUFFY]
How come?!

181
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,423
We're friends, right? So get on.

182
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:42,563
[USOPP]
Hey! I see an island!

183
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:46,500
[LUFFY] Awesome! I can't
wait to check it out!

184
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:51,739
[LUFFY] All right, let's go!
Merry, full speed ahead!

185
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,174
[USOPP]
Full speed ahead!

186
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,369
I can't take this anymore.

187
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:58,572
Luffy! Usopp!

188
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:19,626
I'm no fool.

189
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,662
I realize it'll take more
than that to beat you.

190
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,335
I know you, Luffy.

191
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:34,141
You fight every battle
with all your strength.

192
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,676
But I'm ready for any
technique you've got!

193
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,483
Special Attack...

194
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:46,220
Gum-Gum Gatling!

195
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,521
...Blasting...

196
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,422
...Cactus Stars!

197
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:01,067
Triple Exploding Stars!

198
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:19,152
Gum-Gum Pistol!

199
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,099
It's time to put an end to this!

200
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:41,775
Gum-Gum Bazooka!

201
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,344
Recognize this?

202
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:47,314
I bet that bazooka would've
hurt. Let's find out!

203
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,516
Impact!

204
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,389
Waaaaaah!!

205
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:58,659
He used an Impact Dial!

206
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,728
Auuuugh!

207
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:08,268
I won't lose to you!

208
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:39,266
I am Usopp, Leader of the
invincible nation of pirates

209
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,368
who reign over this island!

210
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:50,611
[LUFFY] Cheers to a new
ship and a new crewmate!

211
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:53,747
[cheers]

212
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:56,383
[USOPP]
So? How do you like this one?

213
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,752
[LUFFY]
Yeah! Keep it! That's the one!

214
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,288
Okay! It's all done!

215
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,189
Now the Going Merry

216
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,392
has everything she
could possibly need!

217
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:12,699
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Bullet!

218
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,643
Usopp!

219
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:53,740
At least it's over now.

220
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:11,725
[LUFFY]
You idiot.

221
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,194
You knew it would end like this!

222
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,796
You knew you could
never beat me!

223
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,293
[NAMI]
Why did this have to happen?

224
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,537
[LUFFY] Do whatever you
want with the Merry.

225
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:04,178
I won't let anything
hold us back.

226
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:08,482
We're getting a new ship
and sailing forward.

227
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,417
Hey, let me sit up there!

228
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,354
Sorry Usopp, but this seat's
reserved for the captain.

229
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:17,291
Oh! What're you making?
Lemme see, lemme see!

230
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,326
Hold on, the Usopp
Factory is off limits

231
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,194
'til I finish this for Nami.

232
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:35,576
[USOPP] Guys, listen up!
I will go to Elbaf someday!

233
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,745
To the village of warriors!

234
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:41,415
[LUFFY]
Yeah! Great!

235
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:45,418
[USOPP] It's the festival on
the night before gold hunting!

236
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:02,602
[LUFFY] So long, Usopp.
It was fun while it lasted.

237
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,075
[SANJI]
Chopper! Leave him alone!

238
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,244
What are you saying?!

239
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:13,180
He was already
hurt before the fight!

240
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:17,117
If I don't help him,
who knows what'll happen!

241
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,086
[SANJI] He isn't part
of our crew anymore!

242
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,688
[CHOPPER]
So what?! I'm a doctor!

243
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,156
It's my job to treat him!

244
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,730
It's bad enough
that he lost the duel;

245
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:31,365
if you pity him
at a time like this,

246
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:36,537
you'll end up hurting him
more than any of those injuries.

247
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,539
[SANJI] I'm sure you
have good intentions.

248
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:42,409
But all we can do now is
give him dignity in defeat.

249
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,346
He knew that when he
challenged Luffy to a duel,

250
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:47,347
this is how it might end.

251
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,363
It's too much.

252
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:05,666
This is what it
means to be captain.

253
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:09,370
You can't doubt yourself.

254
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:13,507
In times like these if
you lose your confidence

255
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,742
then who can we
have faith in?

256
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,322
Let's pack our things and go.

257
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,337
[ZORO] You know as well
as me that after tonight

258
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,306
we can never return
to this ship again.

259
00:21:57,618 --> 00:22:02,622
♪ ending song ♪

260
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,628
[NAMI]
We've got trouble, Luffy!

261
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,664
The whole town is
getting worked up!

262
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:17,531
[LUFFY]
What's going on?

263
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:19,233
[NAMI]
They're saying Iceberg was shot

264
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:21,068
and he hasn't been
able to wake up!

265
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:23,304
[LUFFY] Poor Ice Pops, we'd
better go check on him!

266
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:24,572
[NAMI]
I'll go, too.

267
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:26,707
[SANJI] In the meantime, Chopper
and I will go look for Robin.

268
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,609
I have a bad feeling about this.

269
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:30,277
[LUFFY]
On the next <i>One Piece</i> :

270
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,747
"Severe Shock Hits The City
of Water! Iceberg Targeted!"

271
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,716
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
