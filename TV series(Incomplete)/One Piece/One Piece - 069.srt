the log is to go ashore.

175
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,125
Not to mention we're
in dire need

176
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,994
of re‐stocking our food supply.

177
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,997
We didn't get so much as a sack
of flour in the last town.

178
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,133
Guys! There's our ticket in.

179
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,167
[NAMI]
Huh?

180
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,041
[LUFFY] Think they'll have a
barbecue restaurant here?

181
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,976
[SANJI] We didn't travel
all this way for barbecue!

182
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,012
[LUFFY] I thought the point
of this visit was to get food?

183
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,481
[SANJI] Food as in supplies
we're going to cook later!

184
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,149
Jeez, what're you thinking?

185
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:50,983
[NAMI]
I don't know.

186
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,854
Usopp might be right
about this one.

187
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,523
Just take a look at the
gargantuan plant life here.

188
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:00,159
I've never seen anything
like it, not even in books.

189
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,195
[BIRD screeches]

190
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,598
[NAMI, USOPP scream]

191
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,201
You're so adorable!

192
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,102
Thank you!

193
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,672
That's not funny!
I was talking to Nami!

194
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,540
What was that screeching?!

195
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,208
[SANJI chuckles]

196
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,544
It's all right, love.
It's only a bird.

197
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,546
Perfectly harmless.
Just like this jungle.

198
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,947
Nothin' to worry about.

199
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,282
[NAMI, USOPP scream]

200
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,285
[SANJI]
Uh... What's wrong?

201
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,560
[SANJI] What the hell's the
matter with you, ya damn bird?!

202
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,096
Ooh. It's big. Could be tasty.

203
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,299
[rumbling]

204
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,369
Hear that?! Is that
the kinda noise

205
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,405
you expect to hear
in a normal jungle?!

206
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,607
That sounded like
a volcano erupting!

207
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,777
We're all going to die!

208
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,607
A tiger?!

209
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,476
It's gigantic!

210
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,146
Uh!

211
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,582
[roars]

212
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,354
What?! Luffy, what
just happened?!

213
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,657
I know normal!
This is definitely not it!

214
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,760
Someone explain to me
how a mammoth tiger

215
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,429
can just keel over
covered in blood!

216
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,465
Log‐Pose and food be damned!

217
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,335
We're not stepping foot on
that island and that's final!

218
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,470
We can still reset the
readings on the ship.

219
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,172
We'll just sit tight until then.

220
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,641
When that's done, we'll
leave and never look back!

221
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,542
[USOPP]
Great!

222
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,546
Yeah. Great. We'll
all just stay here!

223
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,792
[LUFFY laughs]

224
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,027
Sanji, go make lunch!

225
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,195
You want lunch?

226
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,063
[LUFFY]
Yep, and one more thing!

227
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,565
Make it a great big
"pirate lunch"‐‐

228
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,034
with lots of meat
and no veggies!

229
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,236
I'm going to need
some more energy!

230
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,738
Uh! Energy for what?!

231
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,073
What are you doing?!
You're not leaving here!

232
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,575
You know! Heh, heh!

233
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,744
Fun stuff! Do ya
wanna come along?

234
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,078
[NAMI growls]

235
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,047
[NAMI]
It's useless. I can't stop him.

236
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,415
He's too enthusiastic.

237
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,650
[USOPP]
Is he crazy?!

238
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,585
Somewhere out there is
a monster big enough

239
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,087
to grind a tiger into paste!

240
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,823
Sanji! I'm starving!

241
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,257
Right. Be patient.

242
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,092
I'll have it to you
as soon as I can.

243
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,095
[LUFFY laughs]

244
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,096
Say, Luffy!

245
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,731
Would it be all right if
I come along with you?

246
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,599
[USOPP yelps]

247
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,767
Sure! Sounds great!

248
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,269
[NAMI]
No! Vivi, you can't be serious!

249
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,171
Yeah. I'd rather not sit here

250
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,607
with nothing to do but
worry about my troubles.

251
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,776
This will keep me busy
until the log's reset.

252
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,611
Out of the question! Seriously!

253
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,746
It's way too dangerous
for you out there!

254
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,383
I'll be fine. Besides,
I'll have Karoo with me.

255
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,352
[squawks]

256
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,088
Hey something's wrong.
Karoo doesn't look too good.

257
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,122
He might be in shock.

258
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,258
Vivi, if you go exploring,
you'll need to eat.

259
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,292
I'll pack you a lunch.

260
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,460
Thanks.

261
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,596
While you're at it, could you
fix something for Karoo?

262
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,099
Of course! You just
leave it to me!

263
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,313
Now you're all set
and ready to go!

264
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,282
Two pirate lunches
for Luffy and Vivi,

265
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,817
and a special drink for Karoo!

266
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,652
Heh! Thanks.

267
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,226
[VIVI]
Well. See you guys later!

268
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,496
Don't worry!
Everything will be fine!

269
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,433
Vivi. What a girl.
She's so brave.

270
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,269
And just what would
you expect from someone

271
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,638
who could infiltrate
the enemy's ranks.

272
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,643
[ZORO sighs] I'm bored.
I'm gonna take a walk.

273
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,578
Take a walk?!

274
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,818
Uh! Hey! Zoro! Wait up!

275
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:20,786
[ZORO]
Hm?

276
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,755
You know we're kinda
short on food, right?

277
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,658
If you find any animals that
appear edible, bring'em back.

278
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,359
Okay, that's easy.

279
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,461
I could see why you'd want
to send me, cause I can

280
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,697
bring back somethin' you
couldn't catch yourself.

281
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,632
[SANJI] What the hell
does that mean?!

282
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,867
[ZORO growls]

283
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,636
[SANJI] I won't let that
remark go unchallenged!

284
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,172
You're saying you can capture
bigger game than I can?

285
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,342
Like my hunting skills
are inferior?!

286
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,210
Yeah, that's right.

287
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,351
Challenge accepted.

288
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,891
Okay! Winner brings back
the most pounds of meat.

289
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,393
Whaddaya mean pounds,
'cause I'll bring back tons?!

290
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,896
[SANJI] Why don't you let your
hunting do your talking for you.

291
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,232
[ZORO]
Heh. Good luck, cook!

292
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,734
I will never understand it.

293
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,337
Why do those two jerks have
to be so competitive?

294
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,372
Don't cry. If it makes
you feel better,

295
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,208
I'm just as stumped by
their behavior as you.

296
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:20,312
[animals chattering]

297
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,580
[USOPP, NAMI gasp]

298
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,748
We're sitting ducks.

299
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,584
Don't you think I
already know that?!

300
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,219
[USOPP, NAMI exhale]

301
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,257
Why didn't I think
of that before?!

302
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,493
Uh?! Where are you going?!

303
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,763
[USOPP]
Nami, what's wrong?!

304
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:41,000
[NAMI] Mm. That's not it...
Mm... Not this one either.

305
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,267
‐‐Nope.
‐‐[USOPP grunting]

306
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,335
Nami! Whoa! Hey!

307
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,671
What the heck are you
looking for anyway?! Huh?!

308
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:46,572
[NAMI]
Quiet!

309
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,774
I remember reading
about it in a book.

310
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,843
[USOPP]
Uh. Reading about what?

311
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,778
[NAMI]
Little Garden.

312
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,215
[LUFFY chuckles]

313
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,620
[VIVI]
Hey, what's the matter?

314
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,288
Over here! Check it out!

315
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,392
It's a shellfish that
looks like a squid.

316
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,896
[LUFFY]
Shell squidfish! Heh, heh!

317
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:11,697
How strange.

318
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,966
It sort of resembles
an ammonoid.

319
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,268
Cool, huh?

320
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,306
[KAROO squawks]

321
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:30,949
I've got a feeling someone's
been following me for a while.

322
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,818
Nah, couldn't be.

323
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,323
[T‐REX roars]

324
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,901
[SANJI grunts]

325
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,502
Can't you see I'm busy?!

326
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,837
[T‐REX roars]

327
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,840
[SANJI]
Collier Coup!

328
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,684
[ZORO] Hm... I don't know
what you're supposed to be,

329
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,686
but I'm guessing you're edible.

330
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,194
[NAMI]
Let me see... which one was it?

331
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,328
Maybe...

332
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,664
Oh, I think I read it recently,
but I don't remember.

333
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,533
The title's on the
tip of my tongue.

334
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,801
Hm...

335
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,874
[LUFFY]
Huh. That's weird.

336
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,610
What's a Sea King doing on land?

337
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,282
A dinosaur!

338
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,550
Awesome!

339
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,220
[VIVI gasping]
No way! This is unreal!

340
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,187
[LUFFY]
Uh, huh?

341
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,556
Somehow this island
has been frozen in time.

342
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,392
Stuck in the age
of the dinosaurs!

343
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,494
[LUFFY]
Hm?

344
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,395
[VIVI] Travel in the
Grand Line is so difficult,

345
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,664
so no species ever migrated
between the islands

346
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,567
and their unique ecosystems
were preserved!

347
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,236
Some of these islands
have developed

348
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,338
extremely sophisticated
cultures,

349
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,807
both biological
and sociological.

350
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,643
While others remain in a sort
of evolutionary stagnation,

351
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,012
with little to no progression
for several thousands

352
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,080
or tens of thousands,

353
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:14,219
or, in this case, it seems,
even millions of years.

354
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,488
I can only assume that
it's the random climates

355
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,924
within the Grand Line
that make this possible.

356
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,560
I mean... What other
explanation is there?

357
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,730
We're standing on the island
that pre‐dates mankind.

358
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,832
[LUFFY laughs]

359
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,333
Luffy!

360
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,335
[LUFFY]
Dinosaur!

361
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,907
Are you insane?!

362
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,443
Usopp! Usopp?!

363
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,446
[USOPP]
Huh? Nami. What now?

364
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,615
So did you find your book yet?

365
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,617
Uh‐huh.

366
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,256
[T‐REX roars]

367
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,629
You're a rude son of a bitch!

368
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,364
[T‐REX roars]

369
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,704
[SANJI growls]

370
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,554
We both use Three Sword Style.

371
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,900
[ZORO yells]

372
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,367
[NAMI]
This is bad.

373
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,868
This... island.

374
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,037
What. What's wrong Nami?!

375
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,048
[NAMI whimpers]

376
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,884
[USOPP whimpers]

377
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,794
[SANJI]
Strange.

378
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,997
Why do I get the sense
that Nami needs me.

379
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,400
[NAMI gasping]

380
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,802
[LOUIS ARNOTE]
To those who reside here,

381
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,638
and call this island home,
it must seem as if they've

382
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,675
stumbled upon their
very own private garden.

383
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,643
Thus, I have aptly
named this wondrous,

384
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,913
terrifying place. Little Garden.

385
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,816
Louis Arnote, Explorer.

386
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,692
<i>♪Oh, you've got me heart and soul</i>

387
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,195
<i>I wrote you a</i>
<i>love song to let you</i>

388

<i>Know that I wanna be with</i>

389
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,005
<i>Even when the sparkle fades</i>

390
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:25,177
<i>The doubts in vade our</i>

00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:33,518
<i>we'll find a way to look</i>
<i>through the cloudy skies</i>

393
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:37,122
<i>We built a castle of sand</i>

394
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:41,059
<i>And now we're watching</i>

395
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,963
<i>It doesn't have to end</i>

396
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,200

397
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:52,771
<i>we'll build a stronger love</i>

398

00:22:56,742 --> 00:23:00,779

<i>Oh, you've got me heart and soul♪</i>

402
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,798
[NAMI, USOPP scream]
A giant!

403
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:20,665
[USOPP]
Pretend we're dead.

404
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,467
[NAMI]
Doesn't that only work on bears?

405
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,636
[LUFFY]
Woo‐hoo! It's huge!

406
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:25,837
Say, are you human?

407
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,606
[ZORO]
With a big catch like this...

408
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,774
[SANJI]
In this hunting match...

409
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,075
[ZORO, SANJI]
...I'm the winner!

410
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,511
[LUFFY] Hey, old guy,
where're you going?

411
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,612
[NAMI, USOPP]
Duel?!

412
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,580
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

413
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,750
"Huge Duel! The Giants
Dorry And Broggy."

414
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,153
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates!
