00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,535
If we strike first,
they will strike back.

177
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,670
Sire.

178
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,039
We are barely clinging
to power right now as it is.

179
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,640
That does not matter.

180
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,676
I don't care about
my rule at the moment.

181
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,478
Ever since the
Dance Powder incident,

182
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,812
it's been clear that
someone's trying

183
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,848
to tear apart our country.

184
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,883
Are you suggesting that
we attack our citizens

185
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,886
before we determine
who's behind all this?

186
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,821
Because that would be
the true destruction

187
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:09,689
of our kingdom.

188
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,492
Don't you know?
A country is its people.

189
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,895
But sir, whoever is behind this
hasn't shown himself so far.

190
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,064
We can't sit back and wait
for this unknown force

191
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,233
to divide us; we must act!

192
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,501
Can't you see?

193
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,504
Please understand. I can't.

194
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,707
[CHAKA] The king will not allow
us to take the offensive now.

195
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,542
[PELL] We can barely even
keep our own soldiers

196
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,244
happy at this point.

197
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,112
I would feel much better
if we had Igaram

198
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,847
with us at a time like this.

199
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,550
[COBRA] Igaram has left
a note saying that

200
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,119
he's leaving the
island for awhile.

201
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,088
[PELL] Even as we speak
he and Princess Vivi

202
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,756
are still out there somewhere,

203
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,759
trying hard to figure
out who's behind this.

204
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,594
I hope they can.

205
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,696
[SUBORDINATE]
Chaka, Pell, come quickly!

206
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,898
What is it?

207
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,233
It's Karoo.
He's returned to the palace.

208
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,368
Karoo's back?

209
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,948
We heard, your Majesty!
Who sent that letter?

210
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,752
[COBRA]
There's no mistaking it.

211
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,554
It's my Vivi's handwriting.

212
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,656
So your Majesty, it means‐‐

213
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,891
Karoo brought news from Vivi.
What does it say?

214
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,562
[VIVI]
Father.

215
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,264
Everything I have written
here is true beyond a doubt.

216
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,933
Please read this
letter carefully.

217
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,238
[CROCODILE laughing]

218
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,941
[VIVI] I've discovered the
identity of the person

219
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,577
who's trying to destroy
Alabasta Kingdom.

220
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,246
It is a Warlord of the Sea,
Crocodile!

221
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,589
[VIVI] Because of Crocodile,
Igaram is dead.

222
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,325
He died as he lived.
A hero to his country.

223
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,126
It's Crocodile!

224
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,463
I stupidly thought he was loyal
to the World Government.

225
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,931
I never even wondered
if he was the one

226
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,967
behind all of this.

227
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,302
How can he be dead?

228
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,770
He died as he would have wanted,

229
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,839
protecting Princess
Vivi and Alabasta.

230
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,208
[VIVI]
But now, Father.

231
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,311
I have joined forces with
an amazing group of people.

232
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,947
They have given me great
confidence and power.

233
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,782
If I continue to
work beside them,

234
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,551
I believe we will be able
to make a difference

235
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,852
in this country.

236
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,654
We have reason to hope now.

237
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,323
Alabasta can and will be saved!

238
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,791
Please have faith, Father.

239
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,960
We can do this. Vivi.

240
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,067
Vivi's letter mentions
that you fought

241
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,336
very valiantly as well, Karoo.

242
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,372
You served her well.

243
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,906
Oh, it looks like
you've been hurt.

244
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,375
Let me see.

245
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,075
[KAROO squawks]

246
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,143
Okay.

247
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,679
No matter what happens
on that island, remember.

248
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:50,683
This thing on all our arms
is a sign of our friendship.

249
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,917
[KAROO squawks]

250
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,019
[COBRA]
Chaka.

251
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,821
[COBRA]
We know the enemy's identity!

252
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,590
Prepare the soldiers
to move out!

253
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,427
Vivi's courage and Igaram's
death won't be in vain.

254
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,029
We're going to take action now.

255
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,865
We'll head for Rainbase,
and Crocodile.

256
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,067
Please do not be so hasty,
Your Majesty.

257
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,735
Rainbase is far away
and there are many

258
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,103
preparations to be made.

259
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,705
What's more, Crocodile has many

260
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,041
of the citizens
firmly on his side.

261
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,543
Even more of them
than you do, Sire,

262
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,378
with all due respect.

263
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,947
If we send forces to
Rainbase now, your Majesty,

264
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,016
the rebels will use
our absence to attack.

265
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,052
And they will take
the palace easily,

266
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,053
in which case‐‐

267
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,888
It doesn't matter if
the rebel army destroys

268
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,391
this palace completely.
It is only a building.

269
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,894
I've told you before,
a country is its people.

270
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,466
Even if our royal army
does fall in the end,

271
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,901
if we can just defeat Crocodile,

272
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,903
this country can still
be reborn as long as

273
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,105
its people are safe and whole.

274
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,907
If we battle the
rebel army instead,

275
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,542
then that will all change.

276
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,811
In that situation,
Crocodile's the victor.

277
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,878
Understand?

278
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,983
Majesty.

279
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,652
Yes, I see.

280
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,587
For right now, we do not
need to be focusing

281
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,055
on the rebel army.

282
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,990
We just need to
take out Crocodile.

283
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,928
This is one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea

284
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:09,962
that we're fighting.

285
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,431
He is strong and cunning.

286
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,999
There will be many casualties.

287
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,936
But we must accept that
and battle onward.

288
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,438
Chaka! We need
to hold a war counsel.

289
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,140
Assemble the officers!

290
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,909
Pell, scout ahead
and conduct reconnaissance.

291
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,444
Right.

292
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,613
[CHAKA] Forgive me for
having underestimated you,

293
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,848
Your Majesty.

294
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,150
You are a true man
of your country.

295
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,786
[COBRA] We head for battle
tomorrow morning!

296
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:34,653
[CHAKA, PELL]
Sir!

297
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,156
All soldiers are
to head for Rainbase.

298
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,036
There.

299
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,471
So is that the city?

300
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,607
[LUFFY, USOPP groaning]

301
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,641
That's it?

302
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,977
[LUFFY]
Oh? Are we here?

303
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,880
[VIVI]
Crocodile!

304
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,815
Yeah!

305
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,484
Time to kick Crocodile's ass!

306
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,006
[LUFFY]
That's Rainbase, huh?

307
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,974
So after all that's happened,
are we operating

308
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,676
under the assumption
that Baroque Works

309
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,878
knows that we're here
on the island with them?

310
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,013
It seems likely.

311
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,849
We did run into Mr. 2,
so I think it's safe to assume

312
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,150
that they have
at least some idea

313
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,885
that we were headed to Alabasta.

314
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,153
Who cares about that?

315
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,855
They know exactly
what we look like,

316
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,657
so we won't be able
to do much of anything

317
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,192
while we're in Rainbase‐‐
just lay low.

318
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,393
And why is that?

319
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,695
Because, if we get spotted
before we can find Crocodile,

320
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,030
I'm sure he can
probably come up with

321
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,866
all sorts of nasty ways
of taking care of us.

322
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,002
Assassination is kinda
their area of expertise.

323
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,103
Laying low!

324
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,206
But we're coming, Crocodile!

325
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,074
You weren't even
listening, were you?

326
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,275
Well, no matter what happens,

327
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,110
I will take it upon
myself to protect

328
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,279
Nami and Vivi from any harm.

329
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,715
I'm always happy to
play prince charming‐‐

330
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,883
for a lady.

331
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:11,951
Smooth one.

332
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,786
Smoother than you are, Zoro!

333
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,222
I need water!

334
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,557
There is none, let it go.

335
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,594
[LUFFY]
I'm going!

336
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,295
[USOPP]
Wait for me, Luffy!

337
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,731
Hey! You might wanna
take some money along!

338
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,141
[TASHIGI]
Captain Smoker.

339
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,143
Why do you think
that they'll be here?

340
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,645
What reason would
the Straw Hats have

341
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,046
for coming to Rainbase?

342
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,815
[SMOKER]
Let's just call it a hunch.

343
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,987
Yeah! Finally, we can get water!

344
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,789
I can't put my finger on it,
but something stinks.

345
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,258
I just feel like
there's something big

346
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,792
lurking in the shadows.

347
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,828
Hey, old lady,
give us some water, 'kay?

348
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,162
Yeah, yeah, a whole barrel!

349
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,765
No, we want more than that!
Five barrels, yeah!

350
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,267
So then, you really
do believe that there is

351
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,736
some sort of a connection
between the Baroque Works

352
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,639

the Straw Hat's crew?

353
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,940
[USOPP, LUFFY]
Water, haha!

354
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:08,974
Here.

355
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,178
[SMOKER] The only thing I know
for sure is that Straw Hat

00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,982

Warlords of the Sea.

[USOPP]
This is the best water ever!

359
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,990
We need to hurry up and get
some back out to the others!

360
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,446
[CHOPPER] I'm gonna go use
the little boys' room.

361

we can count on them

362
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,283

00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,286
Even they can handle
little errands okay, right?

364
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,220
I dunno.

00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,789
I'll bet they'll manage
to screw something up.

366
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,524
It is Usopp and Luffy.

367
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,026
I'd start getting ready
to run if I were you.

Of course. I'm so sorry.

It looks like the Marines
are chasing them.

382

No way!

383
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,592
So why are those
idiots running this way?

384
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,362
Hey. Tony hasn't made
his way back here yet!

385
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,396
He'll be fine.

386
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,831
Chopper can manage on his own.

387
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,400
[LUFFY] Hey, you guys,
I think the Marines are here!

388

lose them this time, men!

391
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,276

Those idiots sure can run.

392
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,611
I'll give 'em that, anyway.

393
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,715
[USOPP] This is bad!
Baroque Works will see us...

394
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,784
...if we run through the city!

395
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,792
I think it's a little
too late for that, Usopp.

396
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,794
[LUFFY]
Then it's decided. Let's go!

397

Huh?

398
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,397
[LUFFY]
To wherever Crocodile is.

399
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,765
How about it. Ready?

400
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,135
[VIVI] Do you see that
building up ahead

401
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,737
with the alligator on its roof?

402
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,440
That's the casino
that Crocodile runs.

403
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,575
It's called Raindinners.

404
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,743
I see it.

405
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,612
So that's where Crocodile is.

406

It'll be better if
we all split up now.

You've got some real
nerve there, Straw Hat.

414
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,466
But don't think
you can run forever!

Ahh! I really do
feel a lot better now.

Where are they?

And that's Zoro's smell!

423
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,302
Sanji's goes this way.

Well, then I guess
we're stuck between

down civilians like that?

That's low even for you!

for doing it, all right?

absolutely no desire

whatsoever to fight you again.

522
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,403
That's not gonna
make him come out!

523
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,671
[USOPP] We're already fighting
someone the people love.

524
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,807
Do you wanna make these
customers our enemies too?

525
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,609
[NAMI] Without Vivi,
we don't have any idea

526
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,943
who Crocodile is.

527
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,279
Wait. Come to think of it,
where is Vivi?

528
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,914
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

529
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:39,251
"The Trap of Certain Defeat!
Storming Raindinners."

530
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,920
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
