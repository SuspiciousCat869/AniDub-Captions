1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,038
It's the One Piece
treasure giveaway!

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:06,640
The first key letter to be
on the lookout for is...

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:10,377
We'll tell you how to enter
at the end of the show!

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,646
You Straw Hats are nuts!

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,348
None of you make any damn sense!

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,482
All of you are so stubborn,

7
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,519
especially when it has anything
to do with your friends!

8
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,521
Well, we've come this far.

9
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,523
So, you want to escape, huh?

10
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,358
Then here's your big chance!

11
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:37,771
Hold on!

12
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,106
I'm not trying to escape!

13
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,442
I won't run!

14
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,244
Robin, what's wrong with you?

15
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:44,278
Cut it out!

16
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,747
There's no point in
trying to pretend anymore!

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,515
We know, okay?

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,285
We know what you did and
we came here to rescue you!

19
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:52,252
It doesn't matter if they

20
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,455
"Buster Call" us to
the ends of the world,

21
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:55,789
we'll fight them and win!

22
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,758
There's no reason for
you to keep obeying them

23
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,395
and throw your life away!

24
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,529
You're wrong.

25
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,798
If there's a Buster Call.

26
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,600
You'll be obliterated.

27
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:20,581
Tempest Kick!

28
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,148
Sanji!

29
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,291
What just happened?

30
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:31,759
He came outta nowhere.

31
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,527
How did he do that?

32
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,237
This is no good.

33
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,038
I gotta come up with something.

34
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:48,576
Halt!

35
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,410
Are you crazy?

36
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,177
Stop it!

37
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,178
Stay back!

38
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,280
I shall be your opponent!

39
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,251
Wait what happened?

40
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,786
He's gone!

41
00:01:58,819 --> 00:01:59,820
Where'd he go?

42
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,655
He didn't run, did he?

43
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,323
That can't be right.

44
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:19,827
Huh?

45
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,295
Blueno disappeared?

46
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,330
Nothing of the sort.

47
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,633
That's the power of
his Door Door Fruit.

48
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,102
He can create a
door out of thin air

49
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:31,171
then use it to travel
to another location.

50
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:35,409
At any rate, don't
bother trying to escape.

51
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,677
It's simply not possible.

52
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:54,160
Let Robin go.

53
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,432
Finger Pistol.

54
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:07,708
Usopp!

55
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,643
Iron Body.

56
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,747
Your last kick
was a lot stronger.

57
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,649
Tired already?

58
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,466
Stubborn one, aren't you?

59
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,668
Stop it!

60
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:38,405
I promise, I have no
intention of running away.

61
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,375
I'll honor the deal-you
don't have to hurt them.

62
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,278
They're the ones
who keep attacking me.

63
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,247
What do you expect?

64
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,649
Then let's hurry and leave
before they get up again.

65
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,721
Wait!

66
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,462
It's all right, Robin.

67
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:04,131
We'll be fine.

68
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,634
I understand what's going on.

69
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:11,271
You're still hiding something
from us, aren't you?

70
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,147
But there's one last thing.

71
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,050
You can do what you want.

72
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:29,589
But a pirate isn't
allowed to leave their crew.

73
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:34,561
Unless they have their
captain's permission.

74
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,133
So no matter what.

75
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:44,371
You can always believe in Luffy.

76
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,523
Robin, don't go!

77
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,825
You can say what
you like to her,

78
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,094
but she won't
break our agreement.

79
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,363
How do you know that?

80
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:46,433
Long ago an island was erased.

81
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:50,537
That is to say, the
Navy issued a Buster Call

82
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,306
and burned it to the ground

83
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:55,376
without leaving a
single trace behind.

84
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,177
The only survivor
of that incident

85
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,814
was Nico Robin,
still a child at the time.

86
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,683
She never told us.

87
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,519
Five vice admirals
and ten battleships

88
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:08,289
are a terrifying force
for anyone to behold.

89
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,492
But for a child to see
them destroy her home.

90
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:14,795
Well, it's nothing
short of a nightmare.

91
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,698
Those thoughts have
haunted her for years

92
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,334
and now that her old
nightmare bares its fangs

93
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:24,438
at her companions she no longer
has the will to resist us.

94
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:30,411
You bastards,
you knew and you used that.

95
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:36,517
Of course we did.

96
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,686
This is sick.

97
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,122
You people are sick,
you hear me?!

98
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,825
All of this is for
the sake of justice.

99
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:49,229
I sympathize with her,
but I cannot be swayed.

100
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,098
Don't give me that crap!

101
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,720
This isn't over!

102
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,294
Hey!

103
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,168
Hurry up and take
a seat, Nico Robin.

104
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,737
We'll be at Enies Lobby shortly.

105
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,210
Wait!

106
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,112
What the hell's going on?

107
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:39,446
Get back here!

108
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,680
You hear me?!

109
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,586
Are you sure about this?

110
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,821
Shouldn't we split those two up?

111
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,291
At this point, there's
nothing they can do.

112
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:53,227
We've almost reached
our destination anyway.

113
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,263
Their hope must
be exhausted by now.

114
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,667
All they can do is quietly
await their execution.

115
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,403
Let them lament their
fates in silence until then.

116
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,531
Gero!

117
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,100
Dumb frog!

118
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,334
Gero?

119
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:37,771
Don't "gero" me,
you big slimy jerk!

120
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,440
You realize that
that slap of yours

121
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,376
derailed our train, don't you?

122
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,110
Froggy!

123
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:43,811
Turn back!

124
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:46,046
Get out of the way!

125
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,548
Gero!

126
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,217
We were about to
catch up with Sanji, too!

127
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,319
Now, apologize!

128
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,188
Gero!

129
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,524
Dumb frog!

130
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,063
I'm gonna eat you!

131
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,735
I dunno what's going
on out there right now,

132
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,403
but it can't be good!

133
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,071
Hey, are you guys all right?

134
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,577
I guess so.

135
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,478
Help!

136
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,145
My back!

137
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,716
Oh no!

138
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,119
Our King Bulls are gone!

139
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,421
They disappeared!

140
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,156
No way!

141
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,424
But how?!

142
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,793
No, we're the ones
who disappeared.

143
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,262
Our train probably got
derailed back there.

144
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,065
Whoa, that's even worse!

145
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,366
What now?!

146
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,768
Well, there's not much we can do

147
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,570
since we're
completely off course.

148
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:43,604
We're gonna die!

149
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:45,605
We're lost at sea forever!

150
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,776
At a time like this?!

151
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:58,118
This guy's one in a million.

152
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,191
There we go!

153
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,295
That frog has some bad timing!

154
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,397
But I can't stay mad at him.

155
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,366
Everyone still alive?

156
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,069
Yeah, somehow.

157
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:18,372
Stupid Yokozuna!

158
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,442
Well, at least they're spunky.

159
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:22,676
Hey!

160
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:23,644
Yeah?

161
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:26,213
Are we gonna be okay, or what?!

162
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,815
If we can't make
it to Enies Lobby,

163
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:30,317
I'm gonna be really pissed off!

164
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,353
Shut yer trap and gimme a sec!

165
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:34,488
I'm trying to work!

166
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:35,722
Huh, that's weird.

167
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,759
Think there's somethin' funny
going on with this current.

168
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,661
Seems like we're stuck.

169
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,296
Kokoro?

170
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,164
Do you know
which direction to go?

171
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,432
Yeah! Of course I do!

172
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:49,303
When we built the Sea Trains we
equipped 'em with Eternal Poses

173
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,705
set to all the islands
with stations on 'em.

174
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,507
Then we'll be fine.

175
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,776
I'll watch the
sea-you just steer.

176
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,645
Huh? You sure that'll help?

177
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:02,383
I'm a navigator. I got this!

178
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,251
I see! Huh!

179
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,186
That's good to know!

180
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,190
Oh, almost forgot.

181
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,393
Hey Yokozuna, stop wrasslin'

182
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:15,629
and get your froggy
butt over here!

183
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:22,136
Gero!

184
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:25,672
He ran away!

185
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:29,043
Gero, gero, gero!

186
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:29,743
What was that?

187
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,412
You're glad I'm still okay?

188
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:32,780
How sweet!

189
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,815
I know you were
just trying to save me,

190
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,483
but you jumped the gun.

191
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,485
These folks didn't kidnap me.

192
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,320
Gero?

193
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:45,425
Does this mean that
Granny can speak frog?

194
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,230
What're you guys looking at?

195
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,701
That ugly old lady is
talking to a giant frog.

196
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:54,668
Oh! I get it!

197
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,437
Granny was a frog all along!

198
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,273
She never quite passed
as a human, now did she?

199
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,208
You realize you guys
are gonna get hit

200
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,309
for that later, don't you?

201
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,777
No kidding.

202
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,713
Hello?! Straw Hat?

203
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:07,281
Rocketman?

204
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,549
Can you see them yet?

205
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:09,416
No.

206
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:10,484
I got nothing.

207
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,753
Damn that stupid frog!

208
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:16,090
That thing musta sent them
flying a million miles away!

209
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:16,790
Hey!

210
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:18,292
Don't start losing hope on me!

211
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:20,427
We set out to
save our bro Franky

212
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,696
and we won't stop
till we make it happen!

213
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:23,830
That's right!

214
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,766
All we can do now is keep
on heading to Enies Lobby

215
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,368
and have faith that Rocketman

216
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,503
is gonna meet us
whenever we get there!

217
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:35,775
Go! Sodom! Gomorrah!

218
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,579
Hey! Hold on.

219
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,281
What's that over there?

220
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:41,682
It looks like there's
another train car

221
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,584
floating just ahead of us!

222
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,486
It could be full of enemies!

223
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,387
All right, guys!

224
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,821
Let's prepare for battle!

225
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,522
Yeah!

226
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,426
Ahoy!

227
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,395
Is anyone in there?

228
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,363
We're the Franky Family!

229
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,066
Come out and show yourself!

230
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,268
Hey, I see someone!

231
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:06,506
It's that dude with
the swirly eyebrows!

232
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,210
Enies Lobby Department
of Management here.

233
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,513
Is everything in order
regarding the transfer?

234
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:13,647
Yes.

235
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:17,183
We will be delivering the
two criminals on schedule.

236
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,288
We can see the island now,
so expect us soon.

237
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,155
Understood.

238
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,691
We'll make preparations
for your return.

239
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,429
I can't help but
feel a bit nostalgic

240
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:31,131
after five years of absence.

241
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,466
The Nightless Island,
Enies Lobby.

242
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:39,740
What?

243
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,742
He's really alive?

244
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,111
You're not just
yankin' my chain?

245
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,613
No.

246
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:48,448
I heard that he still survived.

247
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,785
I see.

248
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,388
That's good.

249
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,190
Stupid Ice-for-brains.

250
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,525
Really had me worried
for a while there.

251
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,161
I thought he was dead for sure.

252
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,329
Man.

253
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:05,599
For the record, CP9 might
think that they killed him.

254
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,768
I'd keep quiet
about it if I were you.

255
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:16,142
You act tough but you got a
heart in there like anyone else.

256
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,754
Anyway, we're in trouble now.

257
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:28,756
The government's got
exactly what they want.

258
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:34,161
The only woman with the know-how
to bring back an ancient weapon

259
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:37,331
and the man with the only
known blueprints for one.

260
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:40,568
Don't that beat all.

261
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:42,636
If the government
actually gets that power,

262
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,506
everything's gonna
get turned upside down.

263
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,408
First they'll
end the pirate era.

264
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,310
We won't be able
to fight back anymore

265
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:52,212
and after they're done
with us just you wait.

266
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,648
They'll turn their guns
on the rest of the world.

267
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,882
I'm telling you,

268
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:59,119
those ancient weapons are gonna
lead all of mankind to ruin.

269
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,322
My master didn't
lay down his life

270
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,724
protecting those
blueprints for nothing.

271
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:10,064
Not if I have anything
to say about it at least!

272
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:13,734
But still, there's no point in
me making it out of here alone.

273
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:18,038
You gotta find some way to get
back to Straw Hat, all right?

274
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,107
I can't.

275
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,044
If I'm with them, it will
only bring them suffering.

276
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,048
As far back as she can remember,

277
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:32,219
her very existence has
been nothing but a sin.

278
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,195
You're not the one
that's hurting them.

279
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,199
Those government
bastards may tell you

280
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,067
that your existence is a crime,

281
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,737
but no matter how
dangerous you may be,

282
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:55,242
just being alive, just being
who you are is never wrong.

283
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,678
Remember, when a ship is built,

284
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:04,084
no matter what type it's
neither good nor evil, Franky.

285
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,787
You got that?

286
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,157
Her very existence has
been nothing but a sin.

287
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,060
What you do is your choice

288
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,129
but there's no right
or wrong in who you are.

289
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:28,208
My goodness, just look at you!

290
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,343
You're covered in scars!

291
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:34,048
Poor kid.

292
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:35,783
It's been eight years now.

293
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:40,154
Eight long years since
Tom was taken away from us.

294
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:43,524
I've watched you challenge the
sea train every day since then.

295
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,725
Again and again.

296
00:18:57,271 --> 00:19:00,708
You were trying to get
stronger, weren't you?

297
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:05,646
So you won't have to lose
the ones you love ever again.

298
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,316
So you'll have the
power to protect them.

299
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,218
Gero.

300
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,720
Don't cry.

301
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:14,154
Now's the time for you

302
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:18,192
to put that training
to the test, big boy.

303
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,160
Gero?

304
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:23,330
You remember your
old pal Franky, right?

305
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,432
He got taken away
by the bad guys, too.

306
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,368
Like Tom.

307
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,669
The good news is,

308
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:32,506
we're on our way
to save him as we speak.

309
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,110
So you up for a fight, or what?

310
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:39,613
Gero Gerooo!

311
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,148
Hey Straw Hat.

312
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,651
I think I found
another friend for ya!

313
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,286
Sounds good to me!

314
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,356
Nice job, Monster Granny!

315
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,692
Wait or is it Frog Granny?

316
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,460
You gotta tell me these things!

317
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,495
Oh?

318
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,266
You call me whatever you like.

319
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,768
Kokoro, I found
us a good current

320
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:02,703
for running to the southwest.

321
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:04,505
All right then!

322
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,807
Well we wasted a
little time back there

323
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,077
but we'll get
it back in a flash!

324
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,612
You heard her, Frog!

325
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:12,780
Let's go!

326
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,348
Gero!

327
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,321
CP9 has arrived!

328
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:22,289
Look sharp!

329
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,725
Congratulations on
completing your mission!

330
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:25,793
Bring out the criminals!

331
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:27,227
They're in car 1!

332
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:30,230
Ah, stop it! No!

333
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,665
Hey, how 'bout you handle me

334
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,134
with a little more
care, ya lugheads!

335
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:37,037
Where I come from, I'm a VIP.

336
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,772
Whoa, everyone stand back!

337
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:39,440
Be careful!

338
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:41,475
That guy bites!

339
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:43,143
You punks want
some of this, huh?!

340
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,144
C'mon, get over here.

341
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,646
Must he be so noisy?

342
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,647
Coo coo!

343
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:54,722
I've never seen them up close.

344
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,456
Pretty intimidating.

345
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,560
That guy's Cutty Flam, right?

346
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:02,630
No way, then the woman must be.

347
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:04,064
Nico Robin?!

348
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,133
Wow, she's gorgeous!

349
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,501
Open the main gate!

350
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,755
Huh?

351
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:28,556
Whoa!

352
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:32,259
What the hell is
this crazy place?!

353
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,603
A waterfall?!

354
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,104
What?!

355
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,316
There's a freakin'
hole in the ocean!

356
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,431
We can finally see Enies Lobby!

357
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,366
You ready to teach
those guys a lesson?

358
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,233
You bet I am!

359
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:22,236
I'm gonna bring
down the whole island!

360
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:24,371
We have Sanji and Uso, I mean,

361
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,574
Sniper King to help us too!

362
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:28,242
They're gonna have
to wait in line,

363
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:30,411
'cause I got a lot
of bashing to do!

364
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:34,181
On the next One Piece:
"Landing Operations Start!

365
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:35,649
