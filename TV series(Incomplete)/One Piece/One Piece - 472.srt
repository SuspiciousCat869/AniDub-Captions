1
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,690
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:39,360
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,061
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,064
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,498
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,235
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,070
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:53,006
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,842
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,378
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,045
of the World Government,

12
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,415
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,719
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,989
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:12,192
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:17,030
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,536
[NARRATOR] Separated from the
rest of his crew, Luffy has

18
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,906
finally arrived at Marineford
to rescue his brother, Ace.

19
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,074
The Whitebeard Pirates have

20
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,876
successfully
pushed into the bay,

21
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,379
but a massive number of Marines
still block the path to Ace.

22
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,748
The battle is spreading
to the bay head,

23
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,084
where allies of Whitebeard
are under attack from

24
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:40,086
the Navy's human weapons,
the Pacifistas!

25
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:46,360
Oh, Squard.
Good to see you're alive.

26
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,262
[SQUARD]
Yeah, barely.

27
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,496
[WHITEBEARD]
Is that so?

28
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,698
I was trying to
reach you earlier.

29
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,200
How're things lookin'
at the bay head now?

30
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,205
I'm sorry to say, but your
allies were beaten pretty badly.

31
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,908
As for me, I only managed to get
out of there through sheer luck.

32
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:05,045
[WHITEBEARD] Sengoku is
one merciless bastard.

33
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,514
He's pulling out every
dirty trick he can think of.

34
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,183
Judging by your shift in tactic,

35
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:12,353
I'm guessing you picked up
on the Navy's plan.

36
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,821
[WHITEBEARD]
I've known Sengoku

37
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,723
and what he's capable
of for a long time.

38
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,861
[MARCO] Huh?
What's Squard doing up there?

39
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,566
You have 43 allied captains
willing to die for you.

40
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,934
We're all in your debt,

41
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,536
for now and for always.

42
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,971
We consider it a privilege to

43
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,874
risk our lives for
you and your crew.

44
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,275
[SQUARD yelling]

45
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,879
[WHITEBEARD gasps]

46
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,396
[LUFFY] "Akainu's Plot!
Whitebeard Entrapped!"

47
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:50,383
[heart beating]

48
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,044
[heart continues beating]

49
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,444
[panting]

50
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:05,659
[BUGGY, PRISONER A gasping]

51
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:09,029
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL humming]

52
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:15,669
[CROWD murmuring]

53
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:18,539
[MAN A]
I-I can't believe it.

54
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,674
It's impossible!

55
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,842
No, it can't be!

56
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:26,179
[MAN A]
Whitebeard has been stabbed!

57
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:30,050
[CROWD shouting]

58
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,091
The old guy?

59
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,660
[MAN AA]
Why? No, who stabbed him?

60
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,730
[MAN BB]
They'll be torn apart!

61
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,164
[MAN AA]
Wait, look!

62
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,433
It was one of Whitebeard's
allies who did it!

63
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,370
A captain from the New World!
The Whirl Spider!

64
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,271
How dare you, Squard!

65
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,272
[SQUARD grunts]

66
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,307
Why the hell did you
attack Pops, huh?

67
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,109
Answer me now,
or I'll kill ya!

68
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,780
Yeah? Then do it! This whole
mess is his fault anyway!

69
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,015
What do ya mean?

70
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:04,151
Do you even realize what
you've just done, you--! Huh?

71
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:06,320
[WHITEBEARD grunts]

72
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,387
[MARCO]
Don't move, Pops!

73
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,090
You'll make things worse
if you keep squirmin'.

74
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,258
Whitebeard!

75
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:15,562
[panting]

76
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,931
I'm serious,
this battle is a fake!

77
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:18,632
Just ask him!

78
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,300
[MARCO gasps]

79
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,270
[SQUARD] I know about your
treacherous deal with the Navy!

80
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,872
You have their
assurance that Ace

81
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,407
and all of your pirates
won't even get scratched!

82
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,943
They'll just go
after your allies!

83
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,380
[BLONDIE]
Hm?

84
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:33,947
Wait, what's he saying?

85
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:37,284
Is it true that they're...
just targeting us?

86
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:40,387
[SQUARD]
Everybody! Listen up!

87
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:44,291
Whitebeard's been
playing us all for fools!

88
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:46,426
[panting]

89
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,329
All this time you've
kept it a secret.

90
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,231
You didn't have
the guts to tell me

91
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:54,368
that Ace is actually the son
of that wretched pirate,

92
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:55,769
Gold Roger!

93
00:08:55,802 --> 00:09:00,807
[SQUARD panting]

94
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,214
When you first found me,
I was alone in this world,

95
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,682
a complete wreck.

96
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:14,722
[thudding]

97
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,724
[MAN CC]
Squard is outta his mind again!

98
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,459
[MAN DD] He's dangerous
when he's like this! Stay away!

99
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,261
[OLD LADY A]
Come on! This again?

100
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,497
[MAN EE] Once he starts, we just
gotta sit back and ride it out.

101
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,938
[yelling]

102
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,474
[SQUARD] Isn't there anyone
strong enough to face me?

103
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:36,043
I'm right here! Bring it on!

104
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,746
How's about Gold Roger,
where's he at?

105
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:39,980
[MAN FF, MAN GG gasping]

106
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,282
[SQUARD] What's a matter?
Are you all scared?

107
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:46,119
[SQUARD laughs]
Gimme your best shot!

108
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,421
[SQUARD gasps]

109
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,360
[SQUARD] You knew why
I was all alone that day.

110
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,833
[SQUARD gasping]

111
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,303
[SQUARD] My precious crew,
who had fought alongside me

112
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:06,473
in so many battles,
was killed by Gold Roger.

113
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:10,377
You know this, and you know
that I despise Roger.

114
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:12,446
More than anything!

115
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,815
Yet you still kept
these secrets from me,

116
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:16,450
that Ace was Roger's son,

117
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:19,453
that you were helping him become
the next King of the Pirates!

118
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,821
How could I trust
someone like you?

119
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,057
[MAN HH]
Never mind the Whitebeards,

120
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,558
take care of yourselves!

121
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,460
Get back down to the plaza!

122
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:29,730
The old guy, he wants
Ace to be the King?

123
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,065
'Cause, ya see, Whitebeard's
the greatest pirate

124
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,500
I've ever met.

125
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:37,003
That's why I'm going to help
him become King of the Pirates.

126
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:43,210
[PIRATES screaming]

127
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:44,712
[SQUARD]
You've been betraying me

128
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:48,148
and playing me for a fool
since the very beginning!

129
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,217
I didn't have a damn clue!

130
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,288
I bet you laughed your ass off
when I became friends with Ace!

131
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,490
Then your favorite
son got caught,

132
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,725
and you showed your true colors!

133
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,362
All of the Whitebeard
Pirates are inside the bay,

134
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:05,065
while us allied pirates
are stuck outside.

135
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,434
Forty-three captains
fight beside you,

136
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,403
and you handed us
all to the Navy!

137
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:12,906
Just to protect Roger's son!

138
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,108
We allied pirates
will be obliterated,

139
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:18,278
whereas Ace and your men
will be completely safe.

140
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:21,982
That's your underhanded
deal with Sengoku, isn't it?

141
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:28,455
[SQUARD] What?
Fire Fist Ace is Roger's son?

142
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:31,658
That's right. And our superiors
already have an agreement

143
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,661
regarding how this
war's going to end.

144
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,894
[SQUARD]
Go to hell!

145
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,297
I don't believe
a word of that crap!

146
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:40,100
Whether you believe it
or not doesn't matter.

147
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,802
You're gonna end up dead anyway.

148
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:46,306
That's enough! We'll see who
ends up dead, you wretch! Ahh!

149
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,344
[SQUARD groans]

150
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:54,315
[AKAINU]
You're a stubborn brat,

151
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:57,484
but you'll learn what
I'm talking about soon enough.

152
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,553
Stand up and look for yourself!

153
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:02,489
[panting]

154
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:05,559
We plan to converge
our forces soon.

155
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:08,662
Then attack the allied
pirates. Only them.

156
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:09,296
Huh?

157
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,897
And Whitebeard?

158
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,368
The Navy isn't even gonna lay
a finger on his gang of pirates.

159
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,436
[SQUARD grunts]

160
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,611
Not one of us knew the truth,
and so, we followed you,

161
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:27,414
risking our lives
to help rescue Ace,

162
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:31,851
only to find out we were nothing
more than sacrifices to you!

163
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,857
We're the ones bearing
the brunt of the Navy's attacks!

164
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,692
It's as clear as day!

165
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,864
[PIRATES yelling]

166
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:55,208
[PIRATES yelling]

167
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,277
[SQUARD] Those monsters
approach from the back,

168
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,847
and the ice blocks
us on both sides.

169
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,049
There's no way we can escape!

170
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:07,887
[KARMA panting] Whitebeard, old
buddy, is he tellin' the truth?

171
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,724
[DECALVAN BROS] He's lying
his teeth off! He's gotta be!

172
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:20,233
It's a miracle I was
able to stab you.

173
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:25,539
Well, now it's
your turn. Kill me!

174
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,149
The ice wall is in the way!
We're blocked off on every side!

175
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:38,018
Oh, no. Is this the end?

176
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,687
[PIRATES yelling]

177
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:46,326
He was right, look!
The Navy's only goin' after us!

178
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,529
[PIRATES yelling]

179
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,064
[PIRATE AA]
Run away!

180
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,835
[PIRATES yelling]

181
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:58,705
Old buddy, please tell me we're
not throwin' our lives away.

182
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:01,775
Just so you can save Ace?

183
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,545
[PIRATE BB]
Please say somethin'! Anything!

184
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:05,812
[PIRATE DD]
Whitebeard!

185
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,376
[gasps]

186
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,448
[WOMAN A gasps]

187
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:42,949
[MAN II] It can't be true!
It's impossible!

188
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,818
[MAN JJ] Whitebeard wouldn't
sell out fellow pirates!

189
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,353
[MAN KK]
He did that to his allies?

190
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,789
[MAN LL] No way,
he'd fight the Navy head-on!

191
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:50,791
[MAN MM] Whitebeard and
the Navy are in cahoots?

192
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,693
[MAN NN] All those
New World pirates who trusted

193
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,727
and followed Whitebeard.

194
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:55,628
[MAN OO]
I know, I can't believe it!

195
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,065
They're all rushing to their
doom thanks to his betrayal!

196
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:01,802
I didn't wanna believe it.
We're all sons to you,

197
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:04,271
but I guess some kids are
just worth more than others!

198
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:06,206
You're a damn fool!

199
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,041
The Navy is
deceiving you, Squard!

200
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,977
Why trust them instead of Pops?

201
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,980
I know you're in on the deal,
don't you play dumb with me!

202
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,383
You're the first
division commander!

203
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,785
You're basically
Whitebeard's right-hand man!

204
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:22,356
If anyone knows about his
deal with the Navy, it's you!

205
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,291
[WHITEBEARD]
It ain't Ace's fault his old man

206
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:27,394
killed Squard's crew,
but it is what it is.

207
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,496
And I can only blame
myself for keeping it

208
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,000
a secret all these years.
The Navy made the right move.

209
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,435
That doesn't make you
any less of a bastard, though,

210
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:39,306
Sengoku, even if you
are a crafty one.

211
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,208
It's time to end this.

212
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,542
Go, Aokiji!

213
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:46,980
Hell no! Don't target us!

214
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,215
[MAN PP]
This entire war's a setup?

215
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,717
[MAN QQ]
It can't seriously be fake!

216
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,386
I've wasted my whole day
watching this stuff!

217
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:56,824
[MAN RR]
It shut off!

218
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:57,624
[WOMAN BB]
What's wrong?

219
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:58,992
[MAN SS]
Is it broken?

220
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,538
Now activate the walls!

221
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:11,571
[MARINE AA]
Right!

222
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:22,049
[CROCODILE]
The pirate who defeated me

223
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,518
would never be
struck down so easily.

224
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,455
Especially by his own ally!

225
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:30,558
You're not worth
my time anymore, old man!

226
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,693
If this is how the
great Whitebeard dies,

227
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,694
you'll make a fool of us both!

228
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,602
Oh, boy, that was harsh.

229
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,703
Then it was a matter of pride.

230
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:49,776
[MARCO]
It's true.

231
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,011
He coulda easily blocked that

232
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:54,114
if he was as tough
as he used to be.

233
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,817
It wouldn't have mattered
that it was a surprise attack,

234
00:16:56,851 --> 00:16:59,520
or that it came from
one of his allies.

235
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:00,821
Has Pops gotten weaker

236
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,823
than we thought and
I just didn't notice?

237
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,294
I don't want no sympathy.

238
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,030
There's no way I'm wearing this
crap in front of my enemies!

239
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:11,398
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES]
But Pops!

240
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:14,134
[MARCO] He's letting his
health get worse and worse!

241
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:17,971
[SQUARD]
Huh?

242
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:37,357
I don't know if you realize

243
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,361
the magnitude of what
you've just done, Squard.

244
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,332
You thrust a sword into
your father's body,

245
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:47,034
trying to kill him.

246
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:50,304
You've lost your way,
my poor, stupid son!

247
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,338
[SQUARD gasps]

248
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:02,849
[gasping]

249
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:07,554
But I still love you.
Even if you are a damn fool.

250
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,841
[SQUARD] Cut the crap. You sold
our lives out. All of us.

251
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:31,278
Who took your loyal and
steadfast heart away from your

252
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:34,881
father and delivered it
into the hands of our enemies?

253
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:37,118
Now you tell me his name.

254
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:39,453
Akainu.

255
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,354
Admiral Akainu.

256
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:46,860
[AKAINU] I'm opposed to
such an underhanded plan.

257
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,662
Most people don't
know the truth,

258
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:51,064
so they call Whitebeard a hero.

259
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:53,867
They don't think twice
about praising the man.

260
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:55,870
But you know better.

261
00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:58,471
He's a scumbag who
came to us with a deal.

262
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,241
One that protects his
and his pirates' interests,

263
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,009
but betrays his New World allies

264
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:05,846
without so much
as a second thought.

265
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,282
All those stories and
legends are made up.

266
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,616
[SQUARD grunts]

267
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,319
The one we should kill
in this war is Whitebeard.

268
00:19:12,353 --> 00:19:15,856
Letting him live would be
a great disservice to the world.

269
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,528
If you can help me, I'll save
all of the New World Pirates.

270
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:21,829
[gasps]

271
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:24,664
Whitebeard. Kill him.

272
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:29,336
[gasping]

273
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,105
[SQUARD]
He said if I killed you

274
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:34,274
he would save your
New World allies.

275
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,878
Akainu. So, that's
what he told you.

276
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:41,782
I completely understand
how much you hate Gold Roger.

277
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:45,386
So much so that
I can feel your pain.

278
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:46,687
But listen to me.

279
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,989
It's ridiculous to lay
the blame on a child

280
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,790
for the sins of his father.

281
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:53,126
Did Ace ever do
a thing to hurt you?

282
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,861
[SQUARD gasps]

283
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:57,531
[WHITEBEARD] The two of you have
been through so much together.

284
00:19:57,565 --> 00:20:00,067
Some of it happy,
some of it painful.

285
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,770
But you've weathered it all,
good times and bad,

286
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:06,173
with our brothers in arms.

287
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,976
I never gave a damn
about who Ace's father is,

288
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,477
and I still don't.

289
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:13,814
We all crossed paths on
these seas by chance!

290
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:15,849
And wherever the
hell we came from

291
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,784
doesn't mean a thing anymore.

292
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,686
We're together now.

293
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,956
So, Squard,
please treat him kindly.

294
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:25,959
I don't love Ace more than
any other son of mine.

295
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:28,061
On that, you have my word.

296
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:31,898
Every single one of you
is part of my family!

297
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:42,409
[SQUARD gasping]

298
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:48,081
[WHITEBEARD]
Now, moving on...

299
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:51,851
[WHITEBEARD]
That Sengoku...

300
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:58,725
He hasn't changed
one bit. The bastard!

301
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,160
But that crafty old snake

302
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:02,929
gave us a pretty
good shakeup, didn't he?

303
00:21:03,897 --> 00:21:05,332
[WHITEBEARD]
But to even suggest that

304
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:08,635
I'd sell out my sons
is ridiculous!

305
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:23,617
They can leave now.

306
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:27,053
He destroyed the ice wall.
He's a sharp one.

307
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:34,962
[PIRATE EE] There's nothing
blocking our path.

308
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:36,497
[PIRATE FF]
You're right!

309
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,833
We can take these Navy ships
and sail away whenever we want!

310
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,670
If you're a true pirate,

311
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:47,407
then you choose which
path to take on your own!

312
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:53,580
[SQUARD crying]

313
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:01,055
I knew it was a lie! The Navy's
just trying to tear us apart!

314
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:03,223
Come on, guys!
Let's take it to 'em!

315
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:06,459
Of course they were lying,
old buddy would never betray us!

316
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:07,895
Hear that?

317
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:10,330
We'll die before we ever lose
trust in you, old buddy!

318
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:12,633
[PIRATE HH] Please
forgive me! We were wrong!

319
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:16,003
[PIRATE II] I'll follow you to
the end, Whitebeard, old buddy!

320
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:18,638
[WHITEBEARD]
Think I'm going soft, do you?

321
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,774
Give it a rest, Croco bum.

322
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:24,478
I'm only human,
and every human has a heart,

323
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,281
no matter how large or small.

324
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:29,950
People can call me
a monster all they want,

325
00:22:29,984 --> 00:22:33,988
but the reality is I can't be
the strongest pirate forever.

326
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,456
If I can save this
one young man's life,

327
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,658
I'll have earned the right

328
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:41,027
to retire from this
world once and for all.

329
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:42,963
Those of you who'll
still follow me,

330
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:45,165
put your lives on the line!

331
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:50,170
[PIRATES shouting]

332
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:58,812
Get ready, men!
He's coming this way!

333
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:02,082
The strongest
pirate in the world!

334
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:07,320
Let's attack!

335
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,030
[NARRATOR] At last the
world's most powerful pirate,

336
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,332
Whitebeard, leaps into the fray.

337
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:21,869
The Navy cowers in fear
before the power of his

338
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,271
Tremor Tremor Fruit,
as it literally changes

339
00:23:24,304 --> 00:23:25,839
the landscape of the battle.

340
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:29,643
However, Sengoku has a plan
that may yet turn the tide.

341
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:31,178
[LUFFY]
