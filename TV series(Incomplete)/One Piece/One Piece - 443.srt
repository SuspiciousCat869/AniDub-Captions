1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,324
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,093
A countless array of
pirates go to battle

39
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,395
across the seas in search
of the One Piece,

40
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,397
the legendary
treasure left behind

41
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,133
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

42
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,036
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,371
after eating the
Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,607
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,310
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles

46
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,112
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,613
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,517
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,320
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,857
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,626
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,328
the crew will
cut a path across

53
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,865
the Grand Line
to the New World!

54
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,404
[NARRATOR] After being
separated from his crew,

55
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,407
Luffy set out to rescue
his captured brother Ace.

56
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,944
To do so, he snuck into the
government prison Impel Down.

57
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,180
With the assistance of Ivankov,
the Queen of New Kama Land,

58
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,416
Luffy was finally able
to make it to Level 6,

59
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,086
only to discover that
Ace was already gone.

60
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,422
[MAGELLAN] I assure you,
resistance is futile.

61
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,090
[ACE groaning]

62
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,993
[ACE groans]
Luffy!

63
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,428
[MAGELLAN]
Your brother's a pirate.

64
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,398
His fate was sealed the moment
he stepped in this prison.

65
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:56,903
[ACE sighs] Damn it, Luffy.
I'd hoped Hancock was lying.

66
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:00,173
[INAZUMA] It was a simple plan,
but it defeated us nonetheless.

67
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:03,009
As much as I hate to admit it,
we're trapped here on Level 6.

68
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,544
At least for the time being.

69
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,379
As far as Ace Boy
and the Navy goes,

70
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:11,184
that ship has already sailed,
literally. Give up on him, 'kay?

71
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,186
Or rather, put your
faith in Whitebeard.

72
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,355
There's no way he'd give
up on one of his own!

73
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,357
He'll come up with something.

74
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,059
I'm leaving.

75
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,394
Huh?!

76
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,932
I'm going to Marineford

77
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:31,037
Look. If I give up now,
I'll regret it.

78
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,007
[INAZUMA] You can do as you
like, but first of all,

79
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,209
how do you propose we
get off of this floor?

80
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,510
[CROCODILE chuckles]

81
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,245
[IVANKOV, INAZUMA, LUFFY]
Uh?!

82
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,019
If you want out that
bad, then set me free.

83
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,389
I'll make a hole in the ceiling
and you'll be free to go.

84
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,724
--Sound good?
--[chains rattling]

85
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,594
[CROCODILE chuckles]

86
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,337
[gasps]

87
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,571
[LUFFY]
Crocodile!

88
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,241
[chuckles]

89
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,444
Just like old times, huh?

90
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,579
Did ya miss me?

91
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,355
[LUFFY] "The Ultimate Team Has
Formed! Shaking Impel Down!"

92
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,431
[CROCODILE grunts]

93
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,598
You know, for the life of me,

94
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,702
I couldn't think of a good
reason to break out of here.

95
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,439
But Whitebeard and the Navy
are gonna start a war?

96
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:43,976
This is my chance to bring down
that old man once and for all.

97
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,581
This clash of powers
has piqued my interest,

98
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:51,017
and I've just the
tools at my disposal

99
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,486
to get us a front row
seat to the action.

100
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,289
You scratch my back,
and I'll scratch yours.

101
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,491
Not a bad proposition, is it?

102
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,560
[LUFFY growls]

103
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:07,166
[inaudible]

104
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,810
Screw that crap! You messed up
Vivi's whole country, you jerk,

105
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,113
--you can rot down here!
--That was a long time ago.

106
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,315
That place is no longer
of any interest to me.

00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,349
[LUFFY growls]

108
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,488
--[footsteps]
--[CROCODILE] Hm?

109
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,324
However you may feel,
we still need his help.

110
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,426
If we have an opportunity
to escape from here,

111
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,594
then we're obliged to take it.

112
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,597
What? Are you crazy, Iva?
Do you know what this guy--

113
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,732
It's no time to be hoity-toity.

114
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,335
Sandy Pants here is our
only ticket outside.

115
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,604
[CROCODILE growls]
Hello, Ivankov.

116
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:48,107
My, my, it's been a long
time. Eh, Croco boy?

117
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,709
Hey wait, you two
know each other?

118
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,444
Just a passing acquaintance.

119
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,347
I met him when he was a rookie,
all wet behind the ears.

120
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,583
I wouldn't worry. If this guy
tries to double cross us,

121
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,386
I'll whip him into shape in
a jiffy. As long as I've got

122
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,190
an eye on him, then he
should behave just fine.

123
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,360
[IVANKOV chuckles]
He is a scoundrel,

124
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,595
but he's a scoundrel with
a weakness I know well.

125
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,231
Hey! If you so much as mention
a word of that, I'll--

126
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,433
Easy there!

127
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,302
Sure you want to take that
snippy tone with me, Croco Boy?

128
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,804
Because I'd be more than happy

129
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,139
to reveal your sordid
past right now.

[IVANKOV] Or, you can shut that
mouth of yours, help us out,

and keep your dirty
little secret. Heehaw!

Cocky bastard!

Hey, you guys!
While you're at it,

135
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,320
you should let me
outta here, too!

bone to pick with Whitebeard!

[JIMBEI]
Please, have mercy on me!

142
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,488
I beg you to take me with you!
I will be of great service!

143
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,489
I've known your brother Ace

144
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,791
since he first joined
the Whitebeard pirates!

145
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,527
He's a good friend!
And I know you too,

146
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,429
from all the stories he's told!

147
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,297
I'm not like the
others down here.

148
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,467
I was arrested because I
objected to his execution!

149
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,571
I wanna help save Ace, too!

150
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,442
I swear, I will put my
life on the line for him!

151
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:33,279
[IVANKOV] Mm... Jimbei,
"The First Son of the Sea".

152
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,681
If they imprisoned him here,
then he must have relinquished

153
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,950
his title as one of
the Seven Warlords.

154
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,520
That would mean his
self-proclaimed bond with Ace

155
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,647
has merit indeed.

156
00:08:57,687 --> 00:09:00,223
--[LUFFY] All right then.
--[INAZUMA] Wait, are you sure?

157
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:01,657
You've never even met this man,

158
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:03,693
and he's most
assuredly dangerous!

159
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:06,329
It'll be fine.
Just let him out, okay?

160

You have my gratitude.

Me next! I like Ace, too!

00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,371
I'll die for him and stuff!

for a Death Wink!

Mm.

Two Warlords. Or two
former Warlords, that is.

Wait a sec. Fish guy? For real?

168

You won't regret this.
I will fight to protect Ace,

even if it means my own end.

Ha. If you think you
can stop the war

171

between the Navy and
Whitebeard, go ahead and try.

172
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:52,775
I don't give a damn, either way.
As long as I get a shot

173
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:55,144
at that crusty old bastard,
it's worth it for me.

174
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,014
If you think I'll let you lay
a single finger on Whitebeard,

175
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,382
you're wrong.

176
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:02,885
Well then, why don't
you just try and stop me?

177
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:09,191
Croco Boy.
Your secret past, remember?

178
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,693
[CROCODILE growls]

179
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,062
It's settled then.

180
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:15,298
Let's get moving. We don't
have much time.

181
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:18,768
With a team this formidable, not
even Impel Down can hold us!

182
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:21,070
Hee-haw!

183
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:27,810
All units, Load up, move out.
Use your Prison Bullets!

184
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:30,780
Prepare to deal with
Devil Fruit powers!

185
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:32,481
[GUARD B]
We've reached Level 6, sir!

186
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:34,250
[GUARD A]
Move in!

187
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,425
[GUARDS]
Huh?

188
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,895
[GUARD F] What the heck?
Is that the ceiling?

189
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:47,096
[GUARD G]
Worry about that later!

190
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:50,199
Spread out and search the floor!

191
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:53,336
[SHIRYU] Do you really think
they stuck around here,

192
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:56,972
after making that gigantic
hole, you morons?

193
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:57,973
[GUARD F]
Huh?

194
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,516
S-Shiryu, the Jail Manager!

195
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:11,120
Pathetic. It's as plain as day,

196
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:13,456
you can't do anything
right without me.

197
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:16,559
What a bunch of sorry
excuses for jailers.

198
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,563
Let me give you a hint, so maybe
you can clean up this disgrace.

199
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,865
While you were picking your
noses, the three prisoners

200
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:26,035
you're looking for released
Crocodile and Jimbei.

201
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:30,106
And then climbed up through
that hole to Level 5.

202
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,908
I want you to pass along
a message for me.

203
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,111
Tell Magellan I'll
help him, if he wants.

204
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,012
[GUARD F]
No, that's... Uh!

205
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,483
What?! What did you say?

206
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:42,918
They've escaped with
Jimbei and Crocodile?!

207
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,553
[GUARD F] Yes, sir!
They're not in their cells!

208
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:48,124
No! Are you saying that even
after my brilliant plan,

209
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:50,493
they somehow wormed
their way out of Level 6!

210
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:52,928
And that now they're a
group of 5 roaming wild

211
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,097
and not sleeping like
they're supposed to be?

212
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,399
[GUARD F]
Yes, sir! That's correct!

213
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:59,268
[HANNYABAL yelling]

214
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,337
Do you think I might
be held responsible

215
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,538
for any of this nonsense?

216
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:04,940
Warden Magellan is currently
transporting Portgas D. Ace

217
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,611
to the Navy. So I'm afraid you'd
be responsible for all of it.

218
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:12,515
[HANNYABAL] I knew you were
gonna say that! Ah! Ah...

219
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:15,017
All right, I'm gonna get
out there and fight, too!

220
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,520
All jailers report to
Level 4 immediately!

221
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:19,522
Mistress Sadie! Saldeath!

222
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:22,291
Gather your forces and head
to Level 4 this instant!

223
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,627
I'll be Warden even if
I have to risk my life!

224
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,861
Wait, what am I saying?!

225
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:29,532
Stop those criminals, even if
you have to risk your lives!

226
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,578
[IVANKOV]
You ready to boogie, Bon boy?

227
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:44,647
Yes. Yes, I am, Iva!

228
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,881
[IVANKOV]
Are you sure?

229
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:50,319
Emporio Energy Hormones only
give you strength for one day.

230
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,621
There will be side effects.

231
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:55,925
I know. Go ahead and do it.

232
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,460
I mean, what choice do I have?

233
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:59,962
If I don't, I won't even be
able to get off the floor.

234
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:03,032
Yes, good point!
Unless I wanted to carry you.

235
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,534
Which, for the record, I do not.

236
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:10,406
Emporio Energy Hormone!

237
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:11,407
[BON CLAY groans]

238
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,677
[IVANKOV] Yikes!
Right in the jimmies. Oopsie!

239
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,412
[BON CLAY]
New Kama Power!

240
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:18,981
[LUFFY]
Bon! Please, don't die!

241
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,351
Is everybody ready?

242
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,419
Just so you know,

243
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:25,921
even if we do make it
to the top of the prison,

244
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:27,990
we'll still be in for
one hell of a fight.

245
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:30,459
We're completely
surrounded by the Calm Belt,

246
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,928
which is impassable
in any normal ship.

247
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:34,697
We'll have to steal
a Navy vessel

248
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,199
if we want to go anywhere
near their headquarters.

249
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,568
That means we need more
people to join our team!

250
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:42,037
I know what you're thinking,
we have lots already.

251
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,174
But to be honest, some of you
won't make it out alive.

252
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:46,976
By the time we
reach the top floor,

253
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:48,711
many of you won't
be there to see it.

254
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,180
If you're captured,
you'll be tortured to death.

255
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:54,216
There will be no mercy.
So, if we want to survive,

256
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,418
we need to set free as
many prisoners as possible

257
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:58,554
while we make our way from
here to Level 1.

258
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,123
Whether we like them or
not, we'll need their help.

259
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:03,359
If we can cause enough
chaos to start a riot,

260
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,561
it'll help keep those
jailers occupied.

261
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,297
That means our first step on
each floor is to open the cells

262
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,366
and let our new friends
clear the way for us!

263
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,034
So let's give these
boys hell!

264
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,036
New Kama Land is gonna
rattle this big cage

265
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:16,272
the likes of which they've
never seen before!

266
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:17,706

Are ya ready to rock this,
Straw Hat Boy? Huh?

269
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,552
He went on ahead of us.

270
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:34,189

catch up with him, candies!

272
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:38,260
[BON CLAY] Wait! Somebody,
please! Stop me!

273
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:43,165
I'm going too fast! It's never
been this fast before! [screams]

274
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:45,734
Huh. The hormone seems to
be working a bit overtime.

275
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:49,038
Indeed. But check out those
amazing moves! Very nice.

276
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:53,075
[BON CLAY] It's not nice!
I'm getting sick! Ooh!

277
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,134
At least the Navy will remain

278
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,270
blissfully ignorant
of this disaster.

279
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,105
[sighs] All right!

280
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,741
Back to your posts and
clean up the mess inside!

281
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,176
[GUARDS]
Yes, sir!

282
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:22,247
[LUFFY panting]

283
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,017
It's just before
ten in the morning.

284
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,353
The execution is at
three in the afternoon.

285
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,621
We can be certain that they'll
do everything in their power

286
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,291
to stay on time! So if
Whitebeard is going to

287
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,693
make an attack, it's most
likely that he'll do it

288
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,063
as soon as possible. Ace
should already be on the ship

289
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,333
and en route. The war could
break out at any second.

290
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,802
But they won't kill him
until three o'clock, right?

291
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,371
That means we still
have a chance

292
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,805
to get there and save him!

how Crocodile's Sand-Sand
Devil Fruit power works.

298
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,358
He can turn into sand,
as well as control it.

299
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,595
His right hand can suck
out any type of moisture.

300
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,164

will wither away,

turn into sand.

hanging out right here?

We finally make it to Level 2,
and this is what stops us?

00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,703
If the guards come,
it's all for nothing!

365
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,606
Also, these things won't
stop farting. It's awful!

I'm thinkin' about
breaking outta here,

377
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,387
but I might need a
bit of assistance.

Meanwhile, the
prisoners on Level 2

385
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:23,602
cause a massive riot. Plunging
the prison into utter chaos.

Suddenly, another infamous
pirate breaks into Impel Down.

387
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,508
