That's right.

349
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,769
So that guy is our enemy?

350
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,937
Seems so.

351
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,273
And having him on the other
side is not a good thing.

352
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,111
If Mr. 2 realizes that we're
the ones Baroque Works is after,

353
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,179

memories he got earlier

354

No, hold on a sec.

360

Luffy's slow but he's
right not to be scared.

361
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,797
Just hear me out on this one
and I think you'll agree.

362
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,600
It's actually a good thing that
we ran into Mr. 2 when we did,

363
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,101
because now we can prepare.

364
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,936
And we can beat him
at his own game.

365
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,308
You sure seem to be in
a particularly good mood...

366

[MR. 2]
Un, deux, trios...

367

It's a sea monster!

there alive, that'd be great.

Why... just why? It was food!

00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,274
Because you can't eat a sea cat!

I just can't let you!

395
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,945
Sea cats are sacred
animals in Alabasta.

Well that's good to know...

So! Let me tell you about
the time that I, Usopp,

single handedly fought off
the sea kings of the Calm Belt,

Sea kings? Really?!

405
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,462
And big ones, too! Man!

406
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,563
They were really huge!

Yeah, but don't worry, Luffy.

409
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,504
You'll be able to stuff
yourself full really soon.

410
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:02,574
Yeah? Really? Will we get
another cat to eat, Vivi?

411
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,078
[NAMI] Vivi! The wind and
weather seem to be stabilizing.

412
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,882
Uh‐huh. We're entering the
climate area of Alabasta island.

413
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,417
Seeing a sea cat come out of
the water is proof, as well.

414
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,154
And those things you see
behind us over there...

415
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,556
...are all the proof I need
that we're getting close.

416
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,891
[gasps]

417
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,202
That's a lot of ships, huh?

Who are they?

419
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,906
[USOPP whimpers] They're all
flying the Baroque Works symbol

420
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:34,606
on their masts.

421
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,375
This can't be good.

422
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,410
It looks as if all the
Baroque Works employees

423
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,611
have started gathering.

424
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,580
I'm guessing that these
are the billions.

425
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,416
They're the subordinates
under the officer agents.

426
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,584
Which means that
there are at least

427
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,519

430
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,125
This group will
surely be a lot better

431
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,027

at Whiskey Peak.

if we just go over there

[SANJI]
He's right.

We need to keep our
eyes on the prize

or we might lose
this altogether.

452
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,406
So... is he that similar when
he turns into someone else?

You have no idea!

454
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,343
It's the same, not just similar!

It was crazy! Really!

456
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,647
You shoulda seen it, Sanji,
he changed into every one of us,

457
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,183

got to dance with him.

I'm not really interested in
dancing with a male ballerina.

We know that someone with his
powers is among the enemy,

so we need to be really careful
to be on our guard at all times.

00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:05,330
So, what should I do
to help against this guy?

Just do whatever
it is you can do.

You're not expected to do
anything more, Chopper.

then just run.
