00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,658
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,494
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,229
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,099
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,567
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,403
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,138
after eating the
Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,807
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,710
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,512
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,847
of the World Government,

12
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,218
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,554
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,790
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:14,160
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue.

16
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:19,866
The crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,571
[NARRATOR] Separated from the
rest of the Straw Hat crew,

18
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,408
Luffy is headed toward
Navy HQ with his new cohorts.

19
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:33,479
Ivankov, Jimbei, Buggy,
Crocodile, and more!

20
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,616
All in order to save
his brother Ace.

21
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:40,486
Meanwhile, the other
Straw Hats are busy as well.

22
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,224
"Your combat outfit," huh?

23
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,726
And I fell for it, too!

24
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,195
[ALL]
Aw, you look cute!

25
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,897
Shut up! I do not!

26
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,434
[SANJI] What the hell? Why can't
I land a single attack?

27
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,737
I'm only trying to show you that
you have doubt in your heart.

28
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,640
Shut up! You don't know
what you're talking about!

29
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,209
Oh, don't I?

30
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,644
[gasps]

31
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,347
[SANJI]
"Dear Nami and Robin,

32
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,750
How are you? I hope
this finds you well.

33
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,953
I do so look forward to
seeing the two of you again.

34
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,955
I'm certain when
that time comes,

35
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,259
we'll be better friends
than ever before!"

36
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,861
Right there! I see reindeer!

37
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,767
You're kidding me!
They've got us cornered!

38
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,901
[BIRDS squawk]

39
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,336
[TRIBESMEN]
Huh?!

40
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:34,207
Awesome! Are you guys really
coming to help us?

41
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,475
[CHOPPER groans]

42
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,913
[CHOPPER]
I guess she must be the mother.

43
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:47,320
Ah! I'm officially sick to
death of this stupid place!

"The Friends' Whereabouts!

Gorging Forest's Trap!"

46
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,013
[CAPTAIN JERK]
So, how are you liking those

47
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,883
Sea Prism Stone
armlets we got you?

48
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,422
[ROBIN]
Well, it just goes to show,

49
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:27,360
some men have no taste when it
comes to giving a lady a gift.

50
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,697
Cut the crap! Where can I find
the rest of the Straw Hat crew?

51
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,865
[ROBIN]
If you're trying to seduce me,

52
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,636
you've got a lot to learn
about setting the mood.

53
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,805
[CAPTAIN JERK]
Talk, damn you!

54
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,607
Nico Robin. Last thing we need's

55
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,677
that troublemaker
raising hell around here.

56
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,715
[SLAVER CAPTAIN] Rumor has
it she sank six vessels

57
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,917
when she was only
eight years old.

58
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,319
And something tells me
she's not the type

59
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,823
to accept a life in prison.
If she managed to break out,

60
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,593
she could overturn our entire
country in no time at all.

61
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,695
We have to keep
her identity a secret.

62
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,365
I can't let the insurgents
get their hands on her.

63
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,866

00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,735
'Scuse me, sir?

65
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:09,836
[SLAVER CAPTAIN]
What is it?

66
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,472
Well, it's in regards to
the delays to construction.

67
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,708
Double the laborers' hours and
scale back to one meal a day.

68
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,643
That should help to make
up for the lost time.

69
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,747
Uh, but sir, I've been receiving
more and more reports lately

70
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,849
of growing dissent
amongst the laborers.

71
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,717
We shouldn't be
too harsh on them.

72
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,719
I'm not worried about
the damn peasants.

73
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,955
There aren't even enough of
them to pull off a coup.

The only real threat
facing us now is Nico Ro--

75
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,427
I... Actually,

76
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,597
what I meant to say is that
the laborers are expendable,

77
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,866
and you need to start
treating them that way.

78
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,935
[SLAVER A] Who said you
could stop? Pull harder!

79
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,816

What're ya wastin'
your time for?

The geezer's dying,
just leave him to rot.

Hey! Are you deaf
or somethin'?

89
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,482
Hey, why'd you guys
stop workin'? All right.

90
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,419
Stupid rubes, go on and
get back to your posts!

91
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,022
If you don't feel like working,
I'd be happy to send you

92
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,090
to the prison tower, instead.

[SLAVES sigh]

94
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:44,530
There's nothing worse
than the prison tower.

That poor lady.

00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,438
[CAPTAIN JERK] We know
how much you like seawater,

97
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,808
so go on and drink it up.

98
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,543
You forgot to chill it first.

We're set to make
a fortune off you,

100
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,482
and all we have to do is
hand you over to a Navy ship,

101
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,650
even if you're nothing
but a cadaver.

[SLAVERS laugh]

103
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,454
I bet your mother's so proud.

104
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,889
What did you say?

Lucky us.

How are we supposed to work

108

on a diet like this?

00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,931
A token of thanks
for your cooperation.

Here, enjoy some chocolate.

111
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,002
Thank you. You're too kind.

00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,137
Filthy informant.

113
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:29,108
I just did it to survive,
and it's all mine, dammit!

Hey, wait!

You can't have any!

116
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,446
Just forget her.

117
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,147
You realize what
she did, don't you?

118
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,984
Remember that nice lady you
tried to take in and save?

119
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,487
Well she's in the prison
tower because of her.

120
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,855
[SORAN]
I know she's right.

121
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:46,893
But that lady gave herself
up in order to save us.

122
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,629
I should try to be
as strong as she is,

123
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,831
and I bet she'd forgive her!

124
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,105
What're you doing here?
I won't share!

125
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,548
[SLAVE WOMAN C] All I wanted
was to get out of here.

126
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,051
And I don't feel sorry
for what I've done.

127

[SLAVE WOMAN C]
All right, fine.

128
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:31,187
Uh! Thank you! I knew that
you were really a nice person.

[SLAVE WOMAN C cries]
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,699
But I was just so scared. Our
lives are completely hopeless!

131
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:44,800
We're stuck on this bridge.

132

We do nothing but suffer
till the day we finally die!

133
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:54,277
You know, I still haven't
thanked that lady for saving us.

134
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,680
So this chocolate?
I'll give it to her.

135
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:01,450
[SLAVER G]
Move faster! Get back to work!

136
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,287
Here's your breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

Once you finish that, we'll
get back to our questioning.

hurt pretty bad, young lady.

[MAN A]
Just a decrepit old man.

145
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:24,607
I've only been in this
country for a single day now,

146
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,310
but the guards in charge said
the elderly are useless,

147
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,345
so they promptly
threw me in here.

148
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:34,250
I'm so sorry to hear that.
But I know how you feel.

149
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:58,741
[ROBIN] I can't waste any
more time in this country.

150
00:11:01,444 --> 00:11:04,847
[ROBIN]
I have to get out of here.

151
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,384
Even if it means cutting
off my own arms.

152
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:13,589
[chuckles] My dear lady,
don't do anything so drastic.

153

moment. Do you hear that?

00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:38,808
[ARMY AGENT A]
What are you doing?

172
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,944
A band of dissidents?

173
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:42,912
[CAPTAIN JERK]
Yes, sir.

174
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:44,914
But we were quick to
follow your orders, sir.

175
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,582
All teams descended
on the group,

176
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:48,684
so it didn't get out of hand.

177
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:51,387
[SLAVER CAPTAIN]
What're you talking about,

178
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,088
I didn't give any orders!

179
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:55,825
Don't tell me when
you say "all teams",

180
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,527
do you mean the soldiers
stationed at the prison tower?

181
00:12:58,561 --> 00:12:59,829
[SORAN]
Hey!

182
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,064
[ROBIN]
Soran! How'd you get in here?

183
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,372
I'm an agent working for
the revolutionary army.

184
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:13,709
Are you all right? The
diversion went perfectly.

185
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:16,979
Then good work.

186
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,814
[ARMY AGENT A]
With your command of our forces,

187
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:20,483
I know we can win.

188
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:22,785
[MAN A]
Well. You can count on me.

189
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:26,956
Oh, before we go. Release
the young lady from her cell.

190
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:28,958
She's already been
through enough as it is.

191
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:31,660
[ARMY AGENT A] It looks
like it's your lucky day.

192
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,095
Thanks, I appreciate it.

193
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:34,930
You fool!

194
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:37,533
You really think I give a
damn about the dissidents?

195
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,902
Take down Nico Robin
on sight, men!

196
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:41,704
[SORAN]
This one doesn't fit, either.

197
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,638
Just to warn you,

198
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:45,007
things will get a little
messy for a while.

199
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,443
It'd be in your best interest
to find someplace

200
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:48,644
where you can hide.

201
00:13:48,677 --> 00:13:52,781
I'm afraid you'd only slow
us down if you stick with us.

202
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:55,584
[MAN A]
Already?

203
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:56,852
[CAPTAIN JERK growls]

204
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:58,587
Oh, no!

205
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:01,724
Nico Robin! Kill her!

206
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:17,573
And Clutch!

207
00:14:22,144 --> 00:14:25,648
[SLAVERS groaning]

208
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:26,649
[MEN gasps]

209
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:28,751
The Nico Robin?

210
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:36,692
[ROBIN] I owe you all
a debt of gratitude.

211
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:39,161
And I'll fight beside
you to pay it back.

212
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:41,931
[SLAVER I] Nico Robin is free
and attacking our men!

213
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,967
No! Please, help me! Warden!

214
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,635
[SLAVER CAPTAIN] She broke out!
And now she's coming!

215
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:49,572
It's all over!
Everything is over!

216
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,506
[SORAN]
Nico Robin!

217
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:52,641
[ROBIN gasps]

218
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:55,644
You have a nice name.

219
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,412
[JIMBEI]
Hm?

220
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:41,924
[JIMBEI]
Hey, Luffy.

221
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:45,394
You really need to try to get
some rest, if only a little.

222
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:49,398
[LUFFY] Yeah. Thank you.
But I'm okay.

223
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:58,173
The wind's died down entirely.

224
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,043
We do still have the current
pulling us forward,

225
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:02,344
but there's more
than a good chance

226
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,714
we might not
arrive in time.

227
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:07,282
Hey, Luffy!

228
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:15,524
[JIMBEI] No. There's no point
in making him any more anxious.

229
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,027
He's got enough to worry about.

230
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:23,365
The kid's about to dive head
first into an unimaginable war.

231
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:38,080
Hang on, Ace.

232
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:45,387
[USOPP screams]

233
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,423
It's a giant
man-eating sunflower!

234
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:50,759
[HERACLES] Yes, it is!
And my name is Heracles'n!

235
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:51,660
[USOPP screams]

236
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:53,295
[HERACLES]
Heracles'n!

237
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:55,097
[USOPP]
Help me!

238
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,331
[HERACLES]
Hera--

239
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:59,601
[USOPP] I said "help!" I'm sick
of hearing your stupid name!

240
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:02,171
What? You're depressed?!

241
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:04,073
[HERACLES snores]

242
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,475
[USOPP]
Sleep depressed?!

243
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:09,178
Help me, Heracles,
your name's not stupid!

244
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:11,313
It's perfect for a
hero of the forest!

245
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:13,582
[HERACLES]
Hero of the forest'n?

246
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,717
[USOPP]
Of course you're the hero!

247
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,452
Just look how strong
and cool you are!

248
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:21,223
[HERACLES] Indeed, I am the hero
of the forest'n. Heracles'n!

249
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:23,459
[USOPP] Oh, wow, you're
even cooler than I thought!

250
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:26,061
[HERACLES]
Usopp'n! Here I come!

251
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:29,431
[USOPP]
Help me, Heracles!

252
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,467
[HERACLES]
Boom!

253
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,236
[USOPP]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

254
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:35,571
[HERACLES]
Get ready!

255
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:38,407
[USOPP] Please, Heracles!
Heracles! Heracles!

256
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,409
[HERACLES yells]

257
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:44,313
[USOPP groans]

258
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:51,120
[USOPP]
Why.... Ah!

259
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:15,911
[USOPP]
Plop!

260
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,112
[HERACLES]
Plop!

261
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,198
Ah! I'm still alive!

262
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:39,268
Why do these monster plants
only want to attack me?

263
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:40,903
[HERACLES]
Only the fit survive here!

264
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:43,272
You've gotta stay alert
and have stamina!

265
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:46,141
And you're the weakest
creature on this island.

266
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:48,577
Even the ants'n and worms'n
are stronger than you!

267
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,845
Hey, screw you!

268
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:53,182
I may be weak, but I'm stronger
than a buncha ants and worms--

269
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,217
[HERACLES]
Hm?

270
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,420
[USOPP]
Huge! So huge!

271
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:02,391
[HERACLES]
Hungry?

272
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:03,625
Oh, not for that!

273
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,360
[HERACLES] You gotta eat
if you wanna build up

274
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,929
your stamina and strength!

275
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,797
Yeah, trust me,
I'm starving!

276
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,365
But there's nothing
on this island

277
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,534
I really feel
comfortable eating.

278
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,438
--[stomach growls]
--Oh, but I wish there was.

279
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:19,308
[HERACLES] I think I
might know of somethin'.

280
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,376
[USOPP]
Ugh. We've been walking forever,

281
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,412
are you sure there's
food up here?

282
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:26,882
[HERACLES] Yeah, the best
food on the island'n.

283
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:32,588
[USOPP sighs] Whoa!
What the hell is this place?

284
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:36,592
It smells so good!

285
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,228
Who would eat bugs when
you got stuff like this?!

286
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,631
[HERACLES] Ramen Falls'n!
Spaghetti Patches'n!

287
00:19:42,664 --> 00:19:44,766
Ham Fruits'n!

288
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,436
Chocolate Rocks'n.

289
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:50,706
Take whatever you want.
It's all safe to eat.

290
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:54,576
So I'm okay to eat
this too, right?

291
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:59,581
[HERACLES]
Right. Eat your fill!

292
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,617
Once you've had enough to
build up your stamina,

293
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,486
the man-eating plants'n
won't mess with you!

294
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,654
[USOPP]
Sure, right, good plan.

295
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:09,224
This stuff is so good I feel
like I could eat forever!

296
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,759
[HERACLES]
Eating's only the first step!

297
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,661
You've gotta exercise, too!

298
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:14,229
[USOPP]
Well, yeah, obviously!

299
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:15,797
But I'm still on
the first step here!

300
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:17,966
I've gotta bulk up so
I can become a cool hero

301
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,402
of the forest like you, right?

302
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:23,372
[HERACLES] You wanna
become a hero like me?

303
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:27,542
We're the Heroes of
the Forest. Heracles'n!

304
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:31,446
[USOPP]
Ha, ha! Yes! And Usopp'n!

305
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,216
[HERACLES, USOPP laugh]

306
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:39,354
[HERACLES]
Oh. Usopp'n!

307
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:42,858
Huh? Usopp'n? Where'd you go?

308
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:45,761
[USOPP]
Wow! It's all so good!

309
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:47,429
I can't stop eating this stuff!

310
00:20:47,462 --> 00:20:48,363
[HERACLES]
That way!

311
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:49,865
[USOPP] I don't even
care that I'm full!

312
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:51,934
It's just too delicious!

313
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,336
[HERACLES]
Usopp'n! Where are you?

314
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:57,606
You're gonna be an even bigger
target if you eat too much!

315
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:00,676
[USOPP] Oh, I should stop,
but I can't control my hands!

316
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:04,279
[USOPP laughs]

317
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,716
[HERACLES]
Finally! I found you!

318
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:09,451
[USOPP]
Huh?

319
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:10,619
[HERACLES yelps]

320
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:12,321
[USOPP]
What do you think, Heracles?

321
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:16,491
Seems like the proper amount
of bulk to become a hero, right?

322
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,327
[HERACLES]
What've you done to yourself?

323
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,629
That's the wrong kind
of bulk, you fool!

324
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:22,631
You better burn some calories
right this instant

325
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:25,367
or you're gonna
be in big trouble!

326
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:37,679
[USOPP]
What's that, an earthquake?

327
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,648
[HERACLES]
It's... beginning!

328
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:41,350
[USOPP screams]

329
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,389
[USOPP] Holy crap,
that is a huge mouth!

330
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:48,790
[CREATURES scream]

331
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:53,528
[USOPP] Please don't fall,
please don't fall, don't fall!

332
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,872
--[HERACLES] Usopp'n!
--[USOPP] Heracles!

333
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,407
Don't let go!

334
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:05,941
[HERACLES]
Too heavy!

335
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:08,810
[USOPP screams]

336
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:11,046
[USOPP]
Hey!

337
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:17,352
[USOPP]
Heracles!

338
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:19,955
[HERACLES]
Goodbye. Usopp'n.

339
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:22,591
[USOPP]
So this is how I die?!

340
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:24,026
Oh! Ramen!

341
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,511
[ISLAND belches]

342
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:48,450
[HERACLES groans]
Usopp'n!

343
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:53,722
Oh, man, I can't
eat another bite!

344
00:22:53,755 --> 00:22:55,157
[HERACLES]
Usopp'n.

345
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,626
Don't you realize fat things
are the first creatures

346
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,094
to be eaten on this island?

347
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,163
Wait, are you
talking about me?

348
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:04,833
[HERACLES] It's impossible to
escape from the Bowin Islands!

349
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:07,402
Why didn't you tell
me that before?

350
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:08,470
[HERACLES]
As for me.

351
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:11,606
I'm the hero of
the forest. Her--

352
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:20,982
[NARRATOR]
Zoro wanders a spooky island,

353
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:22,984
trying to reunite
with his friends.

354
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:25,554
Twarted by his poor sense
of direction, Perona,

355
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:28,790
and mysterious adversaries,
his odds do not look good.

356
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,660
Meanwhile, Brook gets
to see some underwear

357
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,795
before his troubles
truly begin.

358
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,630
[LUFFY]
On the next, One Piece!

359
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,601
"The Friends Whereabouts! A
Huge Tomb and the Panty Debt."

360
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:42,504
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates!
