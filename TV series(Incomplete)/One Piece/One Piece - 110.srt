00:09:58,564 --> 00:09:59,565
[MARINES]
Right!

177
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,802
Straw Hat Luffy.

178
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,308
What?!

179
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,410
What do you mean we
can't cross this river?

180
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,278
[VIVI]
Think about it.

181
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,180
Moving Crabs are
creatures of the desert.

182
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,247
They don't take to water.

183
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,949
[USOPP]
Has everyone gone nuts?

184
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:21,153
It's a crab! They can exist
on land and water!

185
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,622
Guys, this is not good!

186
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,523
This is a serious problem!
Look!

187
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,392
If we just carelessly
spend our energy

188
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:29,095
swimming across the river,
we're not gonna make it in time!

189
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:29,962
See here?

190
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,530
After the river,
there's tons of desert

191
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,632
to deal with!

192
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,600
So, if this crab can't make it
to the other shore,

193
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,236
are we supposed to run
the rest of the way on foot?

194
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,404
We don't have a choice.

195
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,339
We won't make it in time!

196
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,541
It's absolutely impossible!

197
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,984
Uh‐oh. Hey, I can see it!

198
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,619
Sandora River straight ahead!

199
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,420
Oh, great.

200
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,089
Help us, Scissors!
Pretty please!

201
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,192
I know.
Scissors loves dancer girls.

202
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,462
Will this do?

203
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,330
[CHOPPER]
Probably.

204
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,198
Wow! I can't take it!

205
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,302
[CHOPPER]
He's looking this way!

206
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,373
[CHOPPER]
We're accelerating!

207
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,409
[SANJI]
Nami swan!

208
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,515
[ZORO] Great! Now we've
got two animals in heat!

209
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,483
[CHOPPER]
All right! We're moving now!

210
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,688
[USOPP] And what exactly
has this solved, Chopper?

211
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,022
Nothing!

212
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,463
Go faster!

213
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,068
[CHOPPER]
He did it!

214
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,637
[SANJI] I'm seeing it,
but I don't believe it.

215
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,372
This crab is incredible!

216
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,374
[USOPP laughs]
Way to go!

217
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,343
Now, don't you stop!
Just keep on going. Hurry!

218
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,512
Run, run, run all the way!

219
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,414
Go! Keep moving!

220
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,050
Nothing can stop us now!
Oh! I love this crab!

221
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,052
Hey, wait a minute!
What's going on?

222
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,655
If I didn't know better,
I'd think we were sinking!

223
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,528
You stupid crab!

224
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,362
[ZORO]
It's over.

225
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,599
No use whining about it.
Keep moving.

226
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,633
[USOPP]
Hold on a second!

227
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,635
Are you sure there aren't
any boats around here?

228
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,604
How long will it take us
to reach the shore?

229
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,039
[VIVI]
The rest of the night.

230
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,373
That's insane!

231
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,211
Thanks a lot!

232
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,246
Thanks for the ride.
Bye, Scissors.

233
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,082
Oh, shut up! He's the reason
we're in this mess!

234
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,420
[USOPP]
What the‐‐?

235
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,623
[GROUP yells]

236
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,174
[GROUP yells]

237
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,675
[VIVI]
It's a Sandoran catfish!

238
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,377
They're rarely seen by humans!

239
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,379
Doesn't seem that rare to me!

240
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,480
[VIVI yells]

241
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,049
[VIVI] Did I mention they
love to eat human flesh?

242
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,152
[USOPP] You could've
told us a bit sooner!

243
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,255
[GROUP yelling]

244
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,363
Get off of me, dammit!
I can't see a thing

245
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,532
with you hanging on
so tight! Chopper!

246
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,336
[USOPP yelling]

247
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,276
[USOPP]
Kung Fu Dugongs?

248
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,644
[CHOPPER] They say they
were just looking out for

249
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,078
their fellow pupils.

250
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,046
[USOPP]
Pupils?

251
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,615
What, they think Luffy's
our master? Please.

252
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,217
[VIVI] You really want
to argue with them?

253
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,485
[USOPP]
Hang in there, little guys!

254
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,487
Just a little further!

255
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,189
Thanks a lot!

256
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,623
[CHOPPER]
Bye‐bye!

257
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,694
Now that things
are going smoothly,

258
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,229
can we make it in time?

259
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,130
[VIVI]
I don't know.

260
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,165
Even riding Eyelash,
I'm not sure when

261
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,266
we would get there.

262
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,335
[USOPP] Not to be pessimistic,
but Eyelash can only

263
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,436
carry two of us.

264
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,737
If Baroque Works
is going to attack us,

265
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,340
it'll be from here on,
so we can't split up.

266
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,776
Isn't there any way
for us to stick together?

267
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,848
Damn. This isn't good.

268
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,629
Look! Over there!

269
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,397
What is it now?
Is it the enemy?

270
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,700
Don't tell me they're
here to kill us already!

271
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,704
No wait! That sound!

272
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,739
Karoo!

273
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,441
[KAROO squawks]

274
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,543
[VIVI] And the Supersonic
Duck Squadron!

275
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,847
[VIVI] You've come to
help us, haven't you?

276
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,148
[KAROO, DUCK SQUADRON squawk]

277
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,216
[VIVI]
Karoo!

278
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,698
[LUFFY coughs]

279
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,803
[LUFFY grunts]

280
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,341
[LUFFY]
Meat!

281
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,849
[LUFFY coughs]

282
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,684
[CROCODILE]
We may both be pirates.

283
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,955
But you fall grossly
short on skill.

284
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,557
This sand storm will
deal Yuba a final,

285
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,426
destructive blow.

286
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,962
Fanning the flames of anger
within the rebel army

287
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,897
until an inferno ignites.

288
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,568
[LUFFY grunting]

289
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,627
[LUFFY grunts]

290
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,447
Thank... Thank you.

291
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,554
Why do you fight?

292
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,328
Those of you with
the name of "D."

293
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,798
"D"?

294
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,502
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
Who are you people?

295
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,970
What are your intentions?

296
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,707
[MISS ALL SUNDAY] Apparently,
you don't have a clue

297
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,309
what I'm talking about.

298
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,982
[PELL]
I found you!

299
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,823
Where is Vivi?

300
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,858
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
My.

301
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,561
Awake already?

302
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,663
[PELL] Now that I've
studied your ability,

303
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,899
this won't turn out
like it did last time!

304
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,569
Be careful, Pell.

305
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,605
Don't wanna overexert yourself.

306
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,079
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
Perfect timing.

307
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,715
Why don't you save
the boy before he dies?

308
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,418
[LUFFY grunting]

309
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,653
After all, if it weren't
for his courage

310
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,756
and selflessness, who knows
if your precious princess

311
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,825
would've made
it back alive at all.

312
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,728
It must please you
to know Vivi's safe.

313
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,697
That even as we speak,
she's on her way to Alubarna.

314
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,400
Though it's a long trip,
and anything could happen.

315
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,636
Guess the situation
is what it is.

316
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:53,906
[ALLIGATOR growls]

317
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,486
[PELL] If I'm not able to
stop her, then who can?

318
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,055
Vivi must be protected
for everyone's sake!

319
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,297
[LUFFY growls]
Meat!

320
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:31,910
[KOZA]
Damn you, Cobra!

321
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,413
My brethren and I are
willing to defend Alabasta

322
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,882
with every last drop
of blood in our bodies.

323
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,151
We will die before
turning it over to you!

324
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,956
[SOLDIERS chattering]

325
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:51,163
[ROYAL SOLDIER E]
Hurry! Step lively!

326
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,432
Stack it up higher!

327
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,500
[ROYAL SOLDIER F]
Get the cannons ready at

328
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,936
the southern gate!
Stop dawdling around and focus!

329
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,905
[ROYAL SOLDIER G] We need
more cannonballs over here!

330
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,309
[ROYAL SOLDIER A]
Chaka!

331
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,947
The enemy's number is said
to be well over two million!

332
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,551
Tell me, soldier, what do
you think of His Majesty's

333
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,153
attack on Nanohana?

334
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,421
I have served his Majesty
for over ten years

335
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,257
and I was quite surprised.

336
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,358
You're right.

337
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,194
There's really no way
anyone could rationalize it.

338
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:25,230
Logic would suggest something
has happened to the king.

339
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:27,799
If true...

340
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,935
It is all the more reason
why we must not

341
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,470
lose this fight.

342
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,372
Bury your fear deep.

343
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,274
For your King's sake.

344
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,976
As well as that
of Princess Vivi!

345
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,280
We will defend this
country at all cost!

346
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,148
[ROYAL SOLDIER A] Everyone
who is not prepared to fight

347
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,983
take shelter outside the city!

348
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,352
We cannot guarantee your
safety if you elect to stay!
