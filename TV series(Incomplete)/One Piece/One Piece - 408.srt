1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,575
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,543
A countless array of
pirates go to battle

39
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,645
across the seas in
search of the One Piece,

40
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,647
the legendary
treasure left behind

41
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:47,350
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

42
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:49,919
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

43
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:51,921
after eating the
Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:54,657
sets sail to become
the next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,660
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles.

46
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,562
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,897
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,869
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:08,004
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:10,907
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,843
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:18,681
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

53
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:22,986
[NARRATOR]
The Straw Hat crew,

54
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,355
needing their ship coated before
their journey to Fishman Island,

55
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:27,690
landed on the
Sabaody Archipelago

56
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:29,359
in search of a
coating mechanic.

57
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:31,928
Little did they know
the man they were looking for,

58
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,697
was once the vice-captain
of the Roger Pirates.

59
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:35,932
After finding him,

60
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:40,603
they were ambushed by Sentomaru
of the Marine Science Unit.

61
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,406
[SENTOMARU]
Ashigara Dokkoi Shove!

62
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,008
Luffy!

63
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,977
[NARRATOR]
To make matters worse,

64
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:50,813
they were also pitted against
the Marine Admiral Kizaru,

65
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:54,684
who proved too deadly a foe
for the exhausted Straw Hats.

66
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:04,427
[KIZARU] Well, you'll have
plenty time to rest up now.

67
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,863
Zoro!

68
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:22,845
]Are you sure you want to do
this, Dark King Rayleigh?

69
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:26,015
Don't go pickin' these
buds before they sprout.

70
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:28,184
Their era's only just beginning.

71
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:31,421
And I wanna see
what they do with it.

72
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:33,556
Rayleigh!

73
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:35,558
[NARRATOR]
Thanks to Rayleigh's help,

74
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,627
the crew made a hasty retreat.

75
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,861
But before they
could celebrate,

76
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:42,699
they were stopped dead in their
tracks by Bartholomew Kuma,

77
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:44,867
a Warlord of the Sea.

78
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:51,607
[KUMA]
You and I...

79
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,409
We'll never meet again.

80
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:02,485
Farewell, Straw Hat.

81
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,157
[LUFFY moans]

82
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:11,828
[NARRATOR] And so the Straw Hat
crew disappeared from Sabaody,

83
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,864
suffering absolute defeat.

84
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,970
[LUFFY] Landing! The All-Female
Island, Amazon Lily!

85
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:30,480
[DUVAL] Damn it, if I
could just wink right.

86
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:32,181
I'd be even more handsome!

87
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:36,252
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]
Cah-lick.

88
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:38,187
[FISH RIDER 386A]
Good news, Duval, we found it!

89
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:39,789
It's at a bay by Grove 41!

90
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:43,493
[DUVAL]
I got it! I'll be right there!

91
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:44,660
All right men, listen up.

92
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:47,764
The pride of the Rosy Life
Riders is on the line here!

93
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:49,065
We can't lose!

94
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:49,899
[FISH RIDERS]
Yes, sir!

95
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,970
Grove 41! Now c'mon,
Motobalo! Go!

96
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:02,145
[DUVAL] I wonder what those
shockwaves were about.

97
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:04,013
They shook
the whole archipelago.

98
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:07,583
I hope the young master
and his friends are all right.

99
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,553
[SHALRIA] What do you mean,
you haven't caught them?

100
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:11,921
[MARINE OFFICER 408A]
Admiral Kizaru is pursuing

101
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,690
them as we speak, so I'm
sure it's only a matter of time

102
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,259
until they're captured, ma'am!

103
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:21,631
You bunch of useless dogs!

104
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:23,199
[SHALRIA]
Not only did you allow them

105
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:25,301
to do this to my
father and brother,

106
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:28,905
you also let every last
one of our slaves escape!

107
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:31,307
And yet I must
save my contempt

108
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,210
for the pirates who made
a mockery of our bloodline!

109
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:36,079
When you catch those heathens,

110
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:38,881
I'll show them
a true living hell.

111
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:42,085
Until they beg for
death on their knees!

112
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:47,623
[FISH RIDER 386A]
Hey Duval-- I mean, handsome.

113
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,860
What do you think's
taking the Straw Hats so long?

114
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:52,895
Maybe those guys
are still chasing 'em.

115
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:55,731
I heard things are a
mess at the port right now.

116
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:58,568
Yeah, I saw it from
the air myself.

117
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:00,770
Pirates and Marines
were fighting like crazy.

118
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:03,206
Hope they didn't
get caught in that.

119
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:04,340
[DUVAL]
Stay sharp!

120
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:07,143
With all of those idiots
running wild all over Sabaody,

121
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,178
who knows if their
ship will be safe.

122
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:12,315
That's why we gotta guard
it with our very lives!

123
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:16,119
Until the coating craftsman
shows up and takes over,

124
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:17,987
don't budge an inch!

125
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:23,025
[DUVAL]
You got that, Rosy Life Riders?

126
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:25,194
[FISH RIDERS]
Roger, Captain Handsome!

127
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,786
[CAMIE] I have a bad feeling
about this all of a sudden.

128
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,056
I sure hope Luffy-chin and
his friends are okay out there.

129
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,158
[PAPPAGU] Come on, Camie!
Don't say stuff like that!

130
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,061
You're just gonna
stress everybody out!

131
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,129
[CAMIE]
Yeah, but--

132
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:46,732
[HACHI] The Straw Hats
are tough, you know that.

133
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,669
There's nothing
to worry about.

134
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,070
I hope you're right.

135
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,638
[PAPPAGU]
Knock it off, Camie!

136
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,407
You're scaring me
over nothing here!

137
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,008
Straw Hat might
not be the brightest,

138
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,810
but he won't
lose in a fight!

139
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,412
You've seen how
strong that guy is!

140
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,281
[SHAKKY] But not
stronger than an Admiral.

141
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,918
I'm not saying
that they'll lose.

142
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,121
But this will take
more than just strength.

143
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,924
[SHAKKY] The seas ahead
will be rough for them.

144
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,359
Filled with waves
the likes of which

145
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,695
have never been seen before.

146
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,898
And yet they must
withstand them, ride them.

147
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,803
It's quiet, but
can you hear it?

148
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,177
[SHAKKY] Little by little,
the tides are changing.

149
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,079
And the world with them.

150
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,118
[NARRATOR] After being
ejected from Sabaody,

151
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:43,022
Monkey D. Luffy found himself
on a very unique journey.

152
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,125
[LUFFY screams]

153
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,694
Zoro! Nami!

154
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:49,762
I'm sorry!

155
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,732
Usopp, Sanji, Chopper!

156
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:53,699
Robin!

157
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,867
Franky, Brook!

158
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,135
Everybody!

159
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,470
Where did you go?

160
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,739
You guys can't be dead!

161
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,310
Damn it, there was
nothing I could do!

162
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,380
That stupid warlord
is gonna pay for this!

163
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,115
Ugh, I hate this!

164
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,316
It sucks!

165
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,852
How far am I
gonna fly, anyway?

166
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,388
[LUFFY panting]

167
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,489
Oh.

168
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,958
Hey, wait a second.

169
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,294
But someone might tell
you he can send you flying

170
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,996
for three days and nights
with those paw pads.

171
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,766
Can't say if it's true
or not, but that's the rumor.

172
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,801
[LUFFY] But that
could be good news.

173
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,803
Maybe everyone
didn't disappear,

174
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,105
they're just flying

I hope that axe guy
was telling the truth.

Although three days of
this sure will be boring.

If I fall in the ocean,
that'll be the end of me.

[LUFFY]
Dunno what happened,

but I don't think my rubber
powers saved me this time.

doing on the ground?

If everyone else had a landing

up all over your body.

do something!

think we should we do?

are you sure
that this was wise?

What could I do?

She was barely alive
when we found her.

314
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:09,605
I thought she might
be from the village!

Well, that should do it!

00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:13,308
Good. Now, step back a bit.

only way to keep them

seems a bit excessive...

than the others, doesn't it?

00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:15,163
What happened?

351
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:16,331
[AMAZON ROUNDEYES]
It's stretching.

352
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:17,099
[AMAZON TWINBUNS]
What is?

353
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,166
[AMAZON ROUNDEYES]
A mushroom!

354
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,138
[AMAZON PONYTAIL]
Let me see! That sounds funny!

355
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:25,274
That's enough.
Stop gawking, ladies.

356
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,042
They aren't putting
on a show for you!

357
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:27,709
Huh?

358
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:29,511
If we leave, so do you!

359
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:32,314
Hey, look. That isn't
normal, is it?

360
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:34,650
It's strange. She's
sort of rugged.

361
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:37,119
Not very well-endowed, either.

362
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:42,291
[SWEETPEA panting]
It's no use.

363
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,327
Come over here, Aphelandra,
you give it a try.

364
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,262
Me? Are you sure?

365
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:48,697
Mm-hmm!

366
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,000
Give it a yank!
It'll come right off!

367
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:54,770
Why don't we all pull
on it? That'll work!

368
00:20:54,803 --> 00:20:56,271
No.

369
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:59,041
If the mushroom
refuses to come off...

370
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:03,645
...then we must burn
it as Belladonna did.

371
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,580
Until naught
but ashes remain.

372
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:07,416
[SWEETPEA]
Yes! A splendid idea!

373
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:08,717
Wouldn't you agree, Margaret?

374
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,453
[MARGARET]
Sure! Burn away!

375
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:14,523
[NYON] Nyo my! What's
this? Is something wrong?

376
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:16,525
[MARGARET]
Oh! Hello Granny Nyon!

377
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:18,460
There's a mushroom
growing on this girl

378
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:20,562
that won't come off
no matter how hard we try!

379
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:23,332
Do you think we should
all pull it together?

380
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,334
Or just burn it off?

381
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,169
Yo, goodness!

382
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,438
But who is she?

383
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,542
The mushroom's
a mystery, too.

384
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:40,582
Let's see...
Where could it be?

385
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:44,419
Oh nyo!

386
00:21:44,453 --> 00:21:46,288
[AMAZON MOHAWK]
Whoa! Hey, Granny Nyon,

387
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:47,823
[AMAZON PONYTAIL]
You aren't ill, are you?

388
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:50,592
Nyo, everything is just fine.

389
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:54,296
Except that this person is a...

390
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:08,510
[NYON] This person
is a... a... is a man!

391
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:10,612
A man!

392
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:34,569
[ALL]
What?

393
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,172
I've never seen a man before.

394
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:40,709
Whatever shall I do?

395
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:45,881
[NARRATOR] Here lies the
maiden island of Amazon Lily,

396
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:51,686
inhabited by a tribe of female
warriors known as the Kuja.

397
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,723
Woe be to the man
who dreams of this land

398
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:57,159
and woe be to
the man who seeks it.

399
00:22:57,192 --> 00:23:00,295
For if they shall ever
set foot upon its soil,

400
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:03,131
death surely awaits them.

401
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:16,244
[NARRATOR] Captured by
the women of Amazon Lily,

402
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:19,314
Luffy tries to escape in hopes
of reuniting with his friends.

403
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:22,250
However, the Snake Princess
is returning to the island.

404
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:24,386
If she learns a man has
been brought to the village,

405
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,388
both Luffy and the women
who rescued him

406
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:28,590
could pay the ultimate price.

407
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:30,258
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece.

408
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:33,728
"Hurry Back to Your Friends!
The Maiden Island Adventure!"

409
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:35,730
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
