1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:38,224
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,860
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:45,365
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:50,370
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,940
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:57,310
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,546
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,216
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,152
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,422
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,132
[ZORO]
One-Sword Style:

48
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,500
Flying Dragon!

49
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,403
[RYUMA]
Three Verse Humming:

50
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,573
Arrow Notch Slash!

51
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,274
[ZORO]
Blaze!

52
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,253
[RYUMA]
My defeat.

53
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,925
[RYUMA] The legendary
owner of this blade

54
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,460
may have
long since fallen,

55
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,930
but its story
does not end here.

56
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:55,268
With you as its master, this
sword will surely be satisfied.

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,449
I'll take this
sword like I said,

58
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:13,286
but let's pretend like
this fight never happened.

59
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,622
Samurai from Wano.

60
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,469
[LUFFY]
"Chopper is Furious!

61
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:33,506
Hogback's Evil
Medical Practices!"

62
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,010
[HOGBACK]
Fasfasfasfas!

63
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,380
Fasfasfasfas!

64
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,025
[HOGBACK] So, how does
it feel to be captured

65
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,560
by the power of
your own friends?

66
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,330
[JIGORO] Heh! Yeah, and
this one used some dumb trick

67
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,499
to try and
feed me some salt!

68
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,401
[ROBIN thinking]
He's strong.

69
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,170
I can't believe
Sanji's so far gone already

70
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,105
that he would kick
Robin like that.

71
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,608
You're not our friend
anymore, you're just a zombie!

72
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,077
Who's this "Sanji"
you keep talking about?

73
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,712
No one can save you now.

74
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,947
[HOGBACK]
Fasfasfas!

75
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,016
I hate to be the
bearer of bad tidings,

76
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,618
but these two
might not have any memory

77
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,353
of being your friends left.

78
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,256
Upon creation, some
zombies retain a small sense

79
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,190
of their former selves.

80
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,393
But the new body
and soul soon synchronize.

81
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,129
Not even a shred
of humanity remains.

82
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,731
They all become
obedient zombies

83
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,233
that follow my every command.

84
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,703
For a zombie,

85
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,472
following orders
is the pinnacle of existence!

86
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,708
Fasfasfasfas!

87
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,443
You've finally convinced me.

88
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,446
You're an evil man all
the way to the core, Hogback!

89
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,550
In the past,
you were responsible

90
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,751
for saving so many lives.

91
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:55,221
I really looked up to you
as a humanitarian and a doctor.

92
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,726
I didn't even mind
your research on zombies.

93
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,395
Seeing as how death
can happen so suddenly,

94
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,564
those who die
and those who are left behind

95
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,500
always leave
so many things left unsaid.

96
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,503
Things that they'll never
have a chance to say again!

97
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,772
If there were some way to
bring the deceased back to life,

98
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,340
even for only a moment,

99
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,677
that brief time
could be spent finding closure.

100
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,580
Even if people called you
a heretic or a mad scientist

101
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,582
and denounced
all the work you did,

102
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,117
it would have been worth it

103
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,018
to heal people's hearts!

104
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,757
That's why when you
said you had spent years

105
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,160
in this place researching
how to resurrect the dead,

106
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,196
I believed you were doing it
with the best of intentions.

107
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,200
Fasfasfasfas!

108
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,268
Fool!

109
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,270
Who would go to that
much trouble to help others?

110
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,340
Your naiveté is astounding.

111
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,208
This is the way
it's always been!

112
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,112
I am a genius
who deserves the best!

113
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,182
[HOGBACK] Money was the driving
force behind using my skills.

114
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,785
But my notoriety led
patients from all over the world

115
00:06:58,818 --> 00:06:59,786
to my doorstep.

116
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,355
There were too many
needy little whiners!

117
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,356
"Save my father!"

118
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,557
"Please, save my child!"

119
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,792
"Save my sweetheart!"

120
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,360
Nag, nag, nag!

121
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,228
What a bother!

122
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,063
It was so annoying!

123
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,500
I was expected
to carry the burden

124
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,537
of all the incompetent
doctors who couldn't help them.

125
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,740
Are you starting to understand
the horrors of being a genius?

126
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,508
[HOGBACK]
If you wish to idolize me

127
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,644
for my work in the
medical field, fine.

128
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,480
But you have no right to
say you're disappointed in me!

129
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,383
If my motives don't
live up to your precious ideals,

130
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,753
then you can just kiss
my ass, you stupid reindeer!

131
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,823
How dare you preach
to me on how to be a doctor!

132
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,258
That's not what
I'm trying to do, you bastard!

133
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,360
I'm trying to tell you
I don't even accept you

134
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,829
as a doctor anymore!

135
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,832
[CHOPPER] I don't
accept these zombies, either!

136
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:49,502
They're already dead, yet you
still have control over them!

137
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,871
You won't let
them rest in peace!

138
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,106
You've made a
mockery of human life!

139
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,176
Fasfasfasfas!

140
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,212
What a narrow-minded
thing to say!

141
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,513
I gave them a new life,

142
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,182
and yet you think they should
just be rotting in the ground?

143
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,684
[CHOPPER]
Yes! I do!

144
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,587
You don't get it,
Doctor Chopper.

145
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,755
You're missing the
scientific breakthrough!

146
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,757
I gave them life after death!

147
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,792
Don't you see?

148
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,698
How can you simply
overlook the value of that life?

149
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,534
Observe!

150
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:27,740
Don't move.

151
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,448
[HOGBACK] Now, while you're
down there, lick the floor.

152
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,819
[CINDRY]
Yes, Master Hogback.

153
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,179
[HOGBACK]
You saw that room.

154
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,849
Didn't you, Doctor Chopper?

155
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,297
That was actually my room.

156
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,431
[HOGBACK]
The photos on the wall

157
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:29,068
are of a deceased stage
actress named Victoria Cindry.

158
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,203
I was infatuated
with her and her charm

159
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,106
for as long as I can remember.

160
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,075
[HOGBACK]
Her beauty and allure

161
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,877
captured not only my heart,

162
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,379
but the hearts
of men all over the country.

163
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,058
[CINDRY]
There we are!

164
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,294
Now it's as
good as new, Doctor.

165
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,495
How embarrassing!

166
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,230
I can't believe
one of my patients

167
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,899
sewed a button on for me!

168
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,903
I'm just happy to help.

169
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,841
Ahahahaha!

170
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,243
[CINDRY]
Thanks to your expert care,

171
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,579
I'm healthy enough
to return to the stage.

172
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,984
Thank you so
much for your help.

173
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,920
Mother, father,
thanks for waiting! Let's go!

174
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,922
Uh!

175
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,462
[HOGBACK]
She was popular without conceit.

176
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,465
She was kind and loving
to her family.

177
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,602
[HOGBACK]
She was a wonderful woman,

178
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,171
thoughtful and
generous to everyone.

179
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,310
[HOGBACK]
But, unfortunately.

180
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,531
[HOGBACK]
She was also spoken for.

181
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:09,001
After I made my mark as
a doctor, I proposed to her.

182
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,204
But, as she was
already engaged, she refused.

183
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,508
[HOGBACK]
Soon after,

184
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,146
I heard the terrible news
about what had happened to her.

185
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,883
[HOGBACK] She had
suffered a fatal "accident."

186
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,187
I was at a loss for words.

187
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,023
In the end,
I left my job behind.

188
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,491
That's when he found me.

189
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:36,328
He appeared out of nowhere
with the solution to everything.

190
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,565
My Master,
Gecko Moria.

191
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,333
I could use
a man of your talent.

192
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,335
Lend it to me,
Doctor Hogback.

193
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,183
[HOGBACK] I accepted
his offer and boarded his ship

194
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,350
on one condition.

195
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,420
That he, combining his
amazing abilities with my own,

196
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,356
would help me bring
my Cindry back to life.

197
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,336
[HOGBACK]
I missed you, my love.

198
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,274
[HOGBACK]
I stole her corpse

199
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,742
in order to obtain a Cindry

200
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,146
that would belong to
and obey only me.

201
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,760
[HOGBACK]
She's alive!

202
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,761
Yes!

203
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,469
I wish every
last plate in the world

204
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,270
would disappear.

205
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,704
[HOGBACK]
What?

206
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,609
Her personality had changed,

207
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,045
and it certainly
wasn't for the better.

208
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,548
However, she
was still beautiful.

209
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,652
And frankly, that was
all that mattered to me!

210
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:40,686
[HOGBACK]
I'm happy.

211
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,655
And I'm sure she is, as well.

212
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,323
I've given her a second life!

213
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,626
A chance to rejoin this
world as a living human being!

214
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,340
[CHOPPER] You call that
a "living human being"?

215
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,808
Tell her to stop that.

216
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,043
Now!

217
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,586
[CHOPPER]
A human being

218
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,521
whose heart and
body have been separated

219
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,656
is no human at all!

220
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,326
You took a corpse that
had no choice in the matter,

221
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,761
and turned it into
nothing more than a monster!

222
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,496
Every time you make
one of these creatures,

223
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,398
somewhere there's
a human you've devastated

224
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,733
with pain and sorrow!

225
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,169
And I can't
let you go unpunished!

226
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,678
And what would a
stupid reindeer pirate-doctor

227
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,247
with such
limited medical skill

228
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,848
possibly know about life?

229
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,351
Cindry, rise!

230
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,353
Rise and kill them all!

231
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,088
Yes.

232
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,260
Now!

233
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,595
You two are
next on the zombie list!

234
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,864
You should
be happy, Doctor Chopper.

235
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,233
You may die,
but once you're brought back,

236
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,302
you'll be the
assistant of the doctor

237
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,371
you've idolized so much!

238
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,209
[CINDRY]
Square Plate Blades.

239
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,614
One! Two! Three!

240
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,557
Stop it.

241
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,126
[CINDRY]
Let go!

242
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,870
Chopper!

243
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:08,968
Fasfasfasfas!

244
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,402
Don't let her size fool you.

245
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,071
Despite her petite figure,

246
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,807
I've modified her
to be a killing machine!

247
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,042
Listen, Cindry,

248
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,813
you don't have to take
orders from that maniac, you--

249
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,981
I'll kill you.

250
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,987
I feel so bad for you.

251
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,922
Look what
Hogback's done to you!

252
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,258
What would your family
say if they knew about all this?

253
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,394
Let go of me!

254
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,829
[CHOPPER]
You've been stitched together

255
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:37,663
like a rag doll,

256
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,999
forced to serve
as an undead slave.

257
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,533
Your loved ones
would be mortified!

258
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,335
[CINDRY]
Stop it! Unhand me!

259
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,105
[CHOPPER] You were born with
both a body and a soul,

260
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,207
but that soul died
a long time ago.

261
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,176
And yet your body is being
forced to follow orders!

262
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,078
Where's the
meaning in that?

263
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,781
Fasfasfasfas!

264
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,883
Don't tell me you
doubt your own eyes, Doctor!

265
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,219
This is what humans
have always dreamed of!

266
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,388
"Resurrection of the Dead!"

267
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,957
Man can live again!

268
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,929
Just because it moves
doesn't make it alive.

269
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,201
To be alive
you gotta be free!

270
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,936
You're treating her
like she's nothing.

271
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,204
Anything that
exists like that

272
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,140
can't be a human being!

273
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,225
Robin! Hurry up and
give her the salt!

274
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,226
Right!

275
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,432
Dogguin, Jigoro!

276
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,233
Help her! Quickly!

277
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,469
Save Cindry!
Kill the others!

278
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,146
Oh, no!

279
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,347
Chopper!

280
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,250
[JIGORO]
Three Sword Style.

281
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,119
One hundred and eight,,,

282
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,190
[JIGORO]
...Caliber Phoenix!

283
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,927
Zoro, stop it!

284
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,301
Now, Doce Fleur!

285
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,871
No!

286
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,172
[JIGORO]
You again?

287
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,009
My Master said,

288
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,878
"Kill the others!"

289
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,316
[DOGGUIN]
Bastard!

290
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,555
Careful with that
attack, you almost killed me!

291
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:47,126
[DOGGUIN]
Stay the hell outta my way!

292
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,630
You're in my way!

293
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,298
I was doin' fine
'til you showed up!

294
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,134
Master told me to
kill the others!

295
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:55,901
Yes, I know that!

296
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,636
We have the same
master, you idiot!

297
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,004
Now, back off!

298
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,306
You back off!

299
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,374
He said,
"Kill the others."

300
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,542
I'll start with you!

301
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,314
[HOGBACK]
Cut it out!

302
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,650
What the hell
are you idiots doing?

303
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,689
Stop fighting, now!

304
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,158
We need to work together!

305
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:19,658
Robin!

306
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,659
Right!

307
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,334
Can't give orders
if you can't talk.

308
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,005
[ROBIN] They didn't
hear that last order,

309
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,174
so they're still
on the previous one.

310
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,109
Now what was
that order again?

311
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,244
"Save Cindry,
Kill the others?"

312
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,580
If "the others"
are everyone but Cindry,

313
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,582
who knows what
could end up happening?

314
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,430
Even without any trace
of their old memories,

315
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,432
those two just can't
seem to get along,

316
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,633
no matter what they do.

317
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,068
[ROBIN]
Amazing.

318
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,415
[ROBIN] This tower is
rather tall, isn't it?

319
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,549
[HOGBACK]
Huh?

320
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,218
If only we were
under your power,

321
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,620
you could kill us by
asking us to jump out of it.

322
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:22,554
Robin?

323
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:26,391
Huh? How dare you
speak to me that way?

324
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,459
[HOGBACK]
You'll be under my control

325
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,561
once I turn
you into zombies!

326
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,730
And once I do,

327
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,398
I'll say,
"Jump off of this tower

328
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,267
and put an
end to yourselves!"

329
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,671
--Yes, master.
--Yes, master.

330
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,677
No! Wait!
That was a mistake!

331
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,647
[JIGORO] I'm gonna be the first
one to obey Master's orders!

332
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,315
[DOGGUIN]
Not if I hit the ground first!

333
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,497
As for us,
we'd rather not.

334
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,269
Oh, no! Dammit!

335
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,205
You pathetic excuses
for humans tricked me!

336
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm supposed to be a genius!

337
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,509
Now, once
Luffy's dealt with Moria,

338
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,612
all the zombies he created on
this island will be purified.

339
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,115
Which means the only thing
left for me to do around here

340
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,816
is kick your ass!

341
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,285
Cindry, listen!

342
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,354
I need you to buy
some time while I escape!

343
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,189
Hey!
Didn't you hear me?

344
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,124
Get them!

345
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,492
It doesn't matter
if they purify you.

346
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,794
I can just give
you another shadow!

347
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,437
My body, it won't move.

348
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,172
What? Cindry!

349
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:36,221
[loud footsteps]

350
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,439
Kushishishi!

351
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,874
He's back!

352
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,717
Kushishishi!

353
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,620
Now! It's finally time!

354
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,558
[MORIA]
Prepare yourself, Straw Hat!

355
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:19,931
[LUFFY]
He's huge!

356
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,566
This guy's my shadow?

357
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,402
[MORIA]
Kushishishi!

358
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,505
So, you're finally
ready to be obedient, eh, Oars?

359
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,574
Then tell me:
Who is your master?

360
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,810
[OARS]
You are, Master Moria.

361
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,446
I live to serve you.

362
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,814
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

363
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:36,948
"Oars Roars!

364
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,750
Come out, Straw Hat Crew!"

365
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,486
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
