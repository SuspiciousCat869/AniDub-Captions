1
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,449
[NARRATOR] The first event
of the Davy Back Fight

2
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,817
is the Donut Race.

3
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,419
Luffy and the
Straw Hats managed

4
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:02,289
to overcome various forms
of sabotage, but even so,

5
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:05,259
Zoro and Chopper's boat
was knocked out of the race.

6
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,261
Now only the <i>Cutie
Wagon</i> , the <i>Barrel Tiger,</i>

7
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,597
and <i>It's A Raft</i>
remain in the event.

8
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,198
It will be a battle
to the finish line!

9
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,413
This race is
really heating up!

10
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,514
The next course obstacle,

11
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,516
the Long Coral Reef,
is dead ahead!

12
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,785
Leading the race is Porche
and the <i>Cutie Wagon</i> !

13
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,554
Pursuing close behind
are the Straw Hats

14
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:36,523
in the <i>Barrel Tiger</i>
and <i>At Least It Floats</i> !

15
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:40,127
Whoa! They're like
Chopper's antlers!

16
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,830
[ROBIN] Why is the coral
in this reef so long?

17
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,132
[SANJI] And why is it
sticking out like that?

18
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,767
Whatever, let's
just get through it.

19
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,435
Look! That weird
reef is causing

20
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,438
some unusual
currents to form.

21
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,241
Going in blind's
not a good idea.

22
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:58,178
Ugh! I can't believe this stupid
race has lasted this long.

23
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,613
We're counting
on you, Monda!

24
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,747
Shay!

25
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:01,882
[ITOMIMIZU] And, don't forget,
there's someone on land

26
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,185
looking for every opportunity
to sabotage this race.

27
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,688
Our boss, Silver Fox Foxy!

28
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,624
Just what does he
have in store for us?

29
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,594
Feh-feh-feh-feh!!

30
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,229
[RANDOM FOXY A]
Yeah! Get them, Boss!

31
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,431
[FOXY CREW B] Hahaha!
It's only a matter of time!

32
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,565
[ITOMIMIZU]
Wait, wait! What's this?!

33
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,001
The Straw Hats
are slowing down!

34
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,238
Come on, Nami!
Keep rowing!

35
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,272
[NAMI]
Not yet.

36
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,041
Not yet?! They're getting
further ahead of us!

37
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,577
I know, okay?!
We're not going in yet!

38
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,178
Sanji, you wait here too!

39
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,113
Anything you say, Nami!

40
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,583
The <i>Cutie Wagon</i> takes
advantage of this opportunity

41
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,686
and plunges forward
into the Long Coral Reef!

42
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,220
Let's go, Monda!

43
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,323
Shay!

44
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:45,326
Hey! Wait a minute!
What's happening?

45
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,427
Monda!

46
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,329
[MONDA]
Shay! Shay! Shay!

47
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,396
[USOPP]
Huh. They came back.

48
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,365
What?! The <i>Cutie Wagon</i>
has been pushed back

49
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,567
out of the reef! What's
happening down there?

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,436
I don't understand!

51
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,804
See? I knew there
was something weird

52
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,772
about those currents.

53
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,209
Now! Let's get moving, Usopp!

54
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,210
Right!

55
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,813
You too, Sanji! Pick up
the pace and follow me!

56
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,816
[SANJI]
Aye-aye!

57
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,351
Let's try
this again, Monda.

58
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,185
[NAMI]
Come on! This way!

59
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,789
[ITOMIMIZU] What's this?! The
Straw Hats are picking up speed!

60
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,558
All three boats
are about to enter

61
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,027
the Long Coral Reef
at the same time!

62
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,365
[ITOMIMIZU] Huh... The <i>Barrel
Tiger</i> and <i>At Least It Floats</i>

63
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,299
haven't been pushed back!

64
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,638
[USOPP]
Hey, what's that?

65
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,741
Feh!! Feh-feh-feh!!

66
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,410
[ITOMIMIZU]
Ha-ha! And there you have it!

67
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:40,281
The devilish interference
we've all been waiting for!

68
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,115
It's some kind
of smokescreen!

69
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,619
You gotta be kidding.
What's that idiot up to?

70
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,221
Hey, I can't see
where we're going.

71
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,325
Now the reef will
be far too dangerous

72
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:54,261
for the Straw Hat teams
to proceed any further!

73
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:59,099
And there you have it!
Operation White Out: Successful!

74
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,734
Let's see how you
navigate through this reef

75
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,404
when you can't
even see through it!

76
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:06,606
You sure it worked?
Puh-puh-puh!

77
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,276
What the hell?!

78
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,413
[ITOMIMIZU] They made it
through with no trouble at all!

79
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,747
How is that possible?

80
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,283
I called it. Puh-puh-puh...

81
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,519
[ITOMIMIZU] Incredible!
The Straw Hats sail through

82
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,654
the Long Coral Reef with ease!

83
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,057
But what about the <i>Cutie Wagon</i> ?

84
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,061
Oh, no! It seems they've
been pushed back again!

85
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,629
Hey, the boat is
moving on its own.

86
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,164
What's going on here, Nami?

87
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,799
This place is a
maze of currents.

88
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,033
Currents?

89
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:36,370
Right! That giant
whirlpool ahead of us

90
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,738
is causing smaller
whirlpools to form

91
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,407
within the reef resulting
in these strange currents.

92
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,475
Doesn't matter
if we can't see,

93
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,544
their course won't change.

94
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:44,812
As long as we take
the right entrance,

95
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,215
these currents will guide the
boat along all by themselves.

96
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,084
Incredible! You're a miracle!

97
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,151
That's what you can
do when you have

98
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,487
the best navigator on the
Grand Line in your crew!

99
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,154
Take that!

100
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,592
Nami-swan!
You're amazing!

101
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,560
Damn it!

102
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,398
[ITOMIMIZu] But they won't
be celebrating for long.

103
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,299
Once they're
out of the reef,

104
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,335
they head straight
into the Long Ring!

105
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,170
Long Coral Reef, Long Ring.

106
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,440
It's just one long
thing after another.

107
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,442
Usopp! Stop freaking
out and use it!

108
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,443
Use what?

109
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,345
The Impact Dial!

110
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,314
But I don't have
it with me though!

111
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,549
Oh yeah?
Then what is this?

112
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,152
What the? When did...
How did you...

113
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,820
Come on, hurry!
If you don't use it soon,

114
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,690
we'll be sucked down
into the giant whirlpool!

115
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,624
Why are you smiling?

116
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,559
You know what it's
like to use that thing!

117
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,561
If I do it again,
I'll break my shoulder!

118
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,164
That's a risk I'm
totally willing to take.

119
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,300
That's because
it's my shoulder!

120
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,301
--Impact Dial!
--Impact Dial!

121
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,368
[USOPP]
Hey!!

122
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:44,305
[NAMI] Come on! We're
running out of time here!

123
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:47,107
So that's why you've
been acting so calm, huh?

124
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,311
You had this planned from
the very beginning didn't you?

125
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,581
Well, it's been a nice life.

126
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,615
Treinta Fleurs!

127
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,021
Now. Do it, Long Nose.

128
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:05,259
[USOPP thinking]
"Do it" my butt. Fine then!

129
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,261
[ITOMIMIZU] Oh! The <i>Barrel
Tiger</i> and <i>At Least It Floats</i>

130
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,463
have picked up some
tremendous speed!

131
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,766
No, wait! They're not just
going faster, they're flying!

132
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,803
They're leaping
right over Long Cape!

133
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:19,439
They have now taken
the lead! But wait!

134
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,346
Oh crap. Oh crap,
oh crap, oh crap,

135
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,647
oh crap, this isn't good!
Aaaaah!!

136
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,751
Whoops. It broke.

137
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,185
[crash]

138
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,691
<i>At Least It Floats</i>
has crash landed

139
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,127
on Long Cape and
broken into pieces!

140
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,263
It can no longer
continue the race!

141
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,499
Such a shame! <i>At Least
It Floats</i> is now disqualified!

142
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,668
I'm so sorry,
Nami, my dear!

143
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,504
Don't worry about us,
just continue the race!

144
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,640
Okay! We will!

145
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,575
[ITOMIMIZU] And with
that move, the <i>Barrel Tiger</i>

146
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,311
now has a commanding lead!

147
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:01,315
Does this mean defeat for
the indomitable <i>Cutie Wagon</i> ?

148
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,584
We were way too easy on them!

149
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,619
Okay, Porche! Hang on tight!

150
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,487
I'm counting on you!

151
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:13,059
Combine! Two! Fish! Engine!

152
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,330
[ITOMIMIZU] They're
not out of the race yet!

153
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,800
By fusing fish-man muscle
with the fin of a shark,

154
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,968
the <i>Cutie Wagon</i> has
doubled its engine speed!

155
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,170
They're blazing through the
coral and closing the gap!

156
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,275
[ITOMIMIZU]
The race is now half over!

157
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,445
Meanwhile, the <i>Barrel Tiger</i>
desperately paddles on!

158
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,047
Usopp! Wake up!

159
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,515
Huh? Where am I?

160
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,283
Get up and start paddling!

161
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,552
Your arm seems to be
bending the wrong way.

162
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,055
YAAAAAHHHH!!

163
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,122
What is that?

164
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,324
[NAMI]
Looks like a course marker.

165
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,558
[ROBIN]
"Turn right."

166
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,261
Ah! Guess we'll
turn right then!

167
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,063
Like hell we will!

168
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,332
[ITOMIMIZU]
What's this?! She broke it!

169
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:56,337
Our Boss' Ploy #18 "Operation
Lie to Them" has failed!

170
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,771
What a formidable woman!

171
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,241
Does she not believe in
anything in this world?

172
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,176
Can it, jackass!

173
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,311
She's foul-mouthed, too!

174
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,413
The race continues
with the <i>Barrel Tiger</i>

175
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,115
maintaining its strong lead!

176
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,555
[NAMI] What are these
columns of water?!

177
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,357
[ITOMIMIZU] They are now
clearing the Long Waves

178
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,525
that reach high into the sky!

179
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,327
Was that supposed to be natural?

180
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,465
Oh, Grandma.
Oh, Boss--I mean--oh, Grandma.

181
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:27,534
Ahh!! Maybe my time
on this Earth is over.

182
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,571
[ITOMIMIZU] The Boss
unleashes his third nasty trick!

183
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:33,407
Hey, you! A dying
granny over here.

184
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,376
Won't you stop and help me?

185
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,811
Unbelievable! She
completely ignores a child

186
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,680
and his sick,
helpless grandmother!

187
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,283
The only thing she cares
about is getting what she wants!

188
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:45,352
How cold-hearted!
The ice queen Navigator Nami!

189
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,419
I told you to can it!

190
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:49,757
I'd never fall for a
ridiculous trick like that!

191
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,158
Did I mention she
was foul-mouthed?

192
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,030
Hey, look! It's
the finish line!

193
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,701
[ITOMIMIZU]] This race
will soon be decided!

194
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,604
Not so fast! It's not
gonna be that easy!

195
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,773
[ITOMIMIZU] The <i>Cutie Wagon</i>
is closing in quickly!

196
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:09,143
These are the final moments
of Round 1's Donut Race!

197
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:12,445
Who. Will. Win?!

198
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,767
[ITOMIMIZU]
Who. Will. Win?!

199
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,502
[CROWD cheers]

200
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,804
I told you.

201
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,239
These lame tricks won't work!!

202
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,810
[ITOMIMIZU] She even sees
through "Operation Fake Goal"!

203
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:46,180
Formidable! Truly formidable!

204
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,148
And now, I have a
question for her!

205
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,352
What is it like to go
through life so jaded?

206
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:52,520
Piss off!

207
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,822
[ITOMIMIZU] It's too late
for her! Her heart is cold!

208
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,557
She has no soul!

209
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,360
But the real goal is nearby.
We're getting close.

210
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:01,128
I'm not using
that dial again!

211
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,296
Yeah, yeah. I know.

212
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,231
[ITOMIMIZU] Meanwhile,
Porche and the <i>Cutie Wagon</i>

213
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,101
have tragically
stopped at the fake goal!

214
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,069
What's going on?
Who won the race?

215
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,739
What the?! Where
did everybody go?

216
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:14,108
[ITOMIMIZU] The purity of
your heart is astounding!

217
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,543
Pay attention, Porche!
You've been tricked!

218
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,545
Those guys are
complete idiots!

219
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,749
I'd die of embarrassment
if we lost to them!

220
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,517
They'd take one
of our crew, too!

221
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,652
That's worse!

222
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,254
Oh, no! This goal
is a complete fake!

223
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:30,357
What?! Who would
do something so evil?!

224
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,326
[ITOMIMIZU]
The <i>Barrel Tiger</i> is finally

225
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,562
approaching the
Long Bamboo Cape!

226
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,331
The goal is
just beyond it!

227
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,366
They're in
the homestretch!

228
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,069
Hey, he's right!
I can see the finish line!

229
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,737
Wait up!

230
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,406
[USOPP] But they're
catching up to us!

231
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:48,142
[ROBIN] There's no way we'll
beat them at this speed!

232
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,009
[NAMI]
I've got an idea!

233
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,711
Usopp, can you
shoot down that bamboo?

234
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,179
Bamboo?

235
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,313
All right.

236
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,150
Like that?

237
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,084
Yes! More! More!

238
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:00,220
Monda! Capote!
Move it! Full speed ahead!

239
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,822
We'll ram them and
sink that stupid boat

240
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,757
to the bottom of the ocean!

241
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:09,496
[USOPP] Take that and that
and that and that and that!

242
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,303
Whoa! Bingo!

243
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,740
Oh, no! Capote!
Say something! I've had it!

244
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,275
They're gonna pay for this!

245
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:24,712
Cutie Baton!

246
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,214
What's that? Some kind
of magic flower trick?

247
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,151
Flower... Shurikens!

248
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:34,387
Oh! Flower Shurikens.
Hey! Look out!

249
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,524
Oh, no! Looks like
we've sprung a leak!

250
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,293
Don't worry!
We can make it!

251
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,528
We're almost to the
goal! Keep paddling!

252
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,831
[ITOMIMIZU] Round #1
of the Davy Back Fight,

253
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:48,769
the Donut Race is
about to come to a close!

254
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:49,603
[FOXY CREW F]
Porche!

255
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:50,770
[FOXY CREW H]
Come on!

256
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,243
Stay strong, Monda!
We can't let them beat us!

257
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,611
Shay!

258
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,680
We're going to lose if
we don't do something!

259
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,582
Bring us up alongside them!

260
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,482
Right, Boss!

261
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,052
[CHOPPER] I can't see!
I wonder who's winning?

262
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:09,723
Made it just in time!

263
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,426
All right! Nami's
team is winning!

264
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,462
Robin, baby!
Nami, my darling!

265
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,665
You look so hot
when you're going fast!

266
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:19,633
[FOXY CREW A] Man,
you guys almost won.

267
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,735
What do you mean?
We're totally gonna win!

268
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,569
Hahahaha!

269
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,339
Not so fast. Take a
look over there.

270
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,640
Our Boss is coming.

271
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,676
[LUFFY] Yeah? So what!
What can he do?

272
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:32,712
Our Boss is just like you.
He has Devil Fruit powers.

273
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,452
Slow-Slow Beam!

274
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,465
[ITOMIMIZU] And the winner
is the <i>Cutie Wagon</i>!

275
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,635
The hero of the first round
of the Davy Back Fight

276
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:58,172
is our very own idol, Porche!

277
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,240
[FOXY CREW I]
All right! Way to go!

278
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,242
Thank you! Thanks, everyone!

279
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,477
[FOXY CREW J]
You're the greatest, Porche!

280
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,445
It's only natural I won!

281
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:08,816
Looks like we're about to
get another crew member.

282
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,051
There's nobody that can
beat the Foxy Pirates.

283
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,686
We always win!

284
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:21,662
Hoi-hoi-hoi-hoi...
Feh-feh-feh!

285
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,098
Now it's time for
you guys to pay up!

286
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,767
We're taking
one of your crew!

287
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,503
Are you guys hurt?
Is everybody okay? Robin?

288
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,238
Yes. We're all right.

289
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,340
What the heck
happened out there?

290
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,042
[NAMI] I'd like to
know the same thing.

291
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,410
We'd all like to
know what happened!

292
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:38,612
Did we really
lose somehow?

293
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,180
It looked like
you were gonna win,

294
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,448
but then you
suddenly slowed down

295
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,616
and they passed you.

296
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,352
Feh-feh-feh-feh!!

297
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,488
There's nothing
strange about that.

298
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:50,190
It was caused by
Slow-mo Photons.

299
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,327
Hey! What did you do to
Nami's team, you smug bastard?

300
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,262
What's a Slow-mo Photo?

301
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:59,366
They are particles unlike any
others known to modern science.

302
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,569
Whatever this light
touches, be it an animal,

303
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,637
a liquid, a solid,
or even a gas,

304
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,407
will lose a fixed
amount of its velocity,

305
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,677
while simultaneously
retaining all its other energy.

306
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,212
You're dumb. That
makes no sense at all.

307
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,314
He just mocked me!

308
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,316
Boss! Are you okay?

309
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:18,152
No way. Something
that ridiculous is just.

310
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,154
Impossible? Is that
what you're thinking?

311
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:22,356
Surely you know
that such a naïve,

312
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,659
childish claim has no merit
out here on these waters!

313
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,528
Everything they
touch slows down.

314
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,430
That's the power
of Slow-mo Photons!

315
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:30,798
Now that makes sense.

316
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:32,499
Why didn't you
say so before?

317
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,168
After I ate the
Slow-Slow Fruit,

318
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,103
I became a Slow-motion
man capable of

319
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,339
producing these
particles from my body.

320
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:39,639
Observe!

321
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:45,346
A floating cannonball!

322
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,214
The Slow-Slow Beam!

323
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,382
Feh-feh-feh!

324
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,551
The effect lasts
approximately 30 seconds,

325
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,220
after which, the object
will regain its original speed

326
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,489
as if nothing
had ever happened.

327
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,292
Feh-feh-feh!!

328
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,762
Can't believe your eyes,
I take it? This...

329
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,597
Boss! Oh, no!

330
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,134
I get it! So that's why
we didn't win the race!

331
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,035
It also explains why they're

332
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,671
so overly confident
about these games.

333
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,673
What a joke of a
Devil Fruit power.

334
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,642
It doesn't matter!
You guys lost!

335
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:17,278
You know all the rules and
you agreed to all the terms!

336
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:21,548
The Donut Race is over!
And we are the winners!

337
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,817
Awe! Too bad for you guys!

338
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,686
[ITOMIMIZU]
That concludes Round #1!

339
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,720
And now we shall commence

340
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,689
with the awarding of the prize!

341
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:30,691
The winning captain
will select a member

342
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,792
of the opposing crew!

343
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:45,406
My first selection
is none other than...

344
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:49,576
You! The doctor!
Tony Tony Chopper!

345
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,647
No! No, I don't
wanna go! No!

346
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,250
Oh, no! Chopper!

347
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:57,551
Such a rare creature!

348
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,154
You're even softer than
I imagined you'd be!

349
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,789
Feh! Feh! Feh!

350
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:04,224
Boss! May I hold him, too?!

351
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:07,261
He's just so damn cute!
And he's ours now!

352
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:10,264
No! No! Nooooo!

353
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:11,765
Chopper!

354
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,036
So, that creep had his
eye set on Chopper, huh?

355
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,440
Well, I suppose that he is among
the rarest of rare animals.

356
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,108
Or maybe he
collects cute things?

357
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:23,077
You know, I wouldn't
rule out a fur fetish.

358
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,479
Why does it even
matter?! Focus, people!

359
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,781
That freak over there
just took our friend!

360
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,584
You guys.

361
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,354
All right, Doctor Chopper.
Enough of all that.

362
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:34,822
You're one of my crew now.

363
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:37,358
You need to pledge
your loyalty to me!

364
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:41,395
And you can start by
putting on this mask.

365
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:44,098
You guys...

366
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:45,699
I'm so sorry that
we lost, Chopper!

367
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,469
We did our best! Fare well.

368
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:53,040
Feh-feh-feh-feh!
He is truly a rarity!

369
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:57,044

reindeer! He's so amazing!

370
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,213
Hahahaha! We're gonna
get along great! Here!

371
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,248
[FOXY CREW B]
Welcome aboard!

372
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:07,121
You guys!!

373
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:11,458
Listen! I only went out
to sea because of you!

374
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:15,462
I won't! No! I refuse!

375
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,798
Luffy! You invited me!

376
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:20,367
I set sail to be
one of the Straw Hats!

377
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,503
I won't go with them!

378
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,338
Please! No!

379
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:27,074
I am the ship's doctor
of the Straw Hat Pirates,

380
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,609
Tony Tony Chopper!

381
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:34,047
I won't go!

382
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:40,220
Quit your bellyaching,
Chopper! It's disgraceful!

383
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,287
Zoro.

384
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,524
[ZORO] You made the choice
to set sail as a pirate.

385
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,659
Only you. And now
you have to live

386
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:48,128
with the consequences
of that decision.

387
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,297
We agreed to the
terms of this game.

388
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,501
You, Usopp, and everyone
else did the best they could.

389
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,136
Not one pirate worth his salt

390
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,639
is going to sympathize
with those tears.

391
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:01,408
A man, would suck it up

392
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,277
and quietly watch
the rest of this game.

393
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:06,347
What's wrong with you?!

394
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,115
Don't you know how
he must be feeling?!

395
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,688
Boil me or cook me alive!

396
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,758
Gimme your worst,
you bastards!

397
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,226
Chopper.

398
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,360
'Atta boy.

399
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:22,730
[FOXY CREW K] Whoa! That
swordsman is totally awesome!

400
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:25,432
All right! You teach
them a lesson, Zoro!

401
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,568
Yeah! Get Chopper back!

402
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,270
[FOXY CREW F] Hey, Boss!
Let's take him next!

[FOXY CREW G]
That reindeer's got guts!

404
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,773
Let's get the
second event started.

405
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:35,442
So inspirational.
I can't stop crying!

406
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:39,046
Yeah. We still have
two rounds left of this.

407
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,414
There's no way we're
letting these jerks

408
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:42,549
take our emergency
food supply.

409
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,451
Sanji! We're counting on you!

410
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,287
[ITOMIMIZU] The exchange is
complete and the excitement

411
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,089
explodes as the Davy Back
Fight enters Round #2!

412
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,457
Hey. Wasn't Chopper
supposed to be

413
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,725
in the second round?

414
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,427
How can he compete
if they took him?

415
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,662
Good point.

416
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:55,529
[FOXY CREW A]
That's one of

417
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:57,131
the most thrilling
parts of the game!

418
00:19:57,164 --> 00:19:58,032
Remember the rules:

419
00:19:58,065 --> 00:20:00,267
You cannot change
your team's roster.

420
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,334
No replacements allowed!

421
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,737
In other words, only the
remaining two contestants

422
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,107
can participate in Round #2's
game: The Groggy Ring!

423
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,310
This gives the Foxy
Team an early advantage!

424
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,277
What?! That's not fair!

425
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:12,379
Actually, you could
sit this one out, too.

426
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:16,050
Nah, but feel free to do
the same thing, you loser.

427
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,251
[NAMI] It's hard to
believe that they're

428
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:19,353
gonna work
together as a team.

00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,321

Knock it off!

431
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:23,757
[ITOMIMIZU] I will now explain
the rules of the Groggy Ring:

432
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,260
We have a playing field,
and we have two goals.

433
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:28,195
Knock the ball into
the goal and you win!

434
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,598
However, The ball
isn't actually a ball.

435
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:32,566
The balls are people!

436
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,035
Both teams must select
someone to be the ball!

437
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,037
Make your selection!

438
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,071
You heard him!

439
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,407
Which one of you two
guys is gonna be the ball?

440
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,077
Ball marker.

441
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,311
Who said you get to pick?!
