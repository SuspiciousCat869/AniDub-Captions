00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:19,386
[GOLD ROGER]
Destiny... Fate... Dreams...

2
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:24,057
These unstoppable ideals are
held deep in the heart of man...

3
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,460
As long as there are people
who seek freedom in this life,

4
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,963
these things shall not
vanish from the earth!

5
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:40,306
<i>People tell me</i>
<i>my head's in the clouds</i>

6
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,574
<i>I don't care what they say</i>

7
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,410
<i>because I'm dreamin' of you</i>

8
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,379
<i>You are the treasure I've found</i>

9
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,215
<i>So bright, so bold,</i>
<i>yet so elusive</i>

10
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,751
<i>It's hard to look away,</i>

11
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,754
<i>even though it's blinding me</i>

12
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,256
<i>There are no words to describe</i>

13
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,291
<i>how I feel inside</i>

14
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,728
<i>I'm really, really stuck</i>
<i>on you whoa, whoa!</i>

15
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,329
<i>I have to follow my dreams</i>

16
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,731
<i>however crazy they seem</i>

17
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,168
<i>And I won't stop 'til</i>
<i>I get there, you will see</i>

18
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,335
<i>You're all I need</i>

19
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,671
<i>to have the strength to believe</i>

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:17,410
<i>Believe in Wonderland!</i>

21
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,781
<i>I'm gonna follow my dreams,</i>

22
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,583
<i>however crazy they seem</i>

23
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,085
<i>I'm gonna share them with you,</i>

24
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,686
<i>a love so true</i>

25
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,256
<i>You're all I want,</i>
<i>together we can move on</i>

26
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,692
<i>Live how we want to!</i>

27
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,327
<i>There is no limit to us,</i>

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,762
<i>we have the power of love</i>

29
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:39,132
<i>And we don't wanna</i>
<i>live ordinary lives</i>

30
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,602
<i>We have the chance</i>
<i>to live in paradise</i>

31
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:49,976
<i>Believe in Wonderland!</i>

32
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,815
[ZORO]
A graveyard?

33
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,150
[APIS]
It can't be,

34
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,952
because Grandpa Ryu promised me

35
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,821
that going back to his nest
would make him better!

36
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,390
It's not a graveyard! It's not!

37
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,460
Apis...

38
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,294
Listen to me.

39
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:11,164
Grandpa Ryu
was lost and lonely...

40
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,165
Luffy?

41
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:15,201
He didn't have a friend
until you came along.

42
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,504
Then... everything
changed for the better.

43
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,006
And he also wanted
me to tell you that

44
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,175
for all the centuries
he's been alive,

45
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:26,045
this last year with you was the
happiest time he's ever known...

46
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,849
Wait... Are you saying
you can understand the dragon?

47
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,351
It just came to me.

48
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,986
[USOPP]
Are you making this up?

49
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,854
Nope... That's what he said!

50
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,422
[APIS]
You're a liar!

51
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,761
[APIS] If this is the place
you always talked about,

52
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,897
then it should heal you
and make you strong again,

53
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,832
like you promised me!

54
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,500
Talk to me!

55
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,436
You have to get better!

56
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,740
Ryu was telling
you the truth, Apis.

57
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:54,908
[LUFFY]
I'm serious.

58
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,177
He said that Millennial
Dragons return to the nest

59
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,847
every thousand years
and are reborn again.

60
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,916
[APIS]
Grandpa Ryu said all that?

61
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:03,783
[LUFFY]
Over there!

62
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,218
[gasps]

63
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,231
[gasps]

64
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,534
[APIS]
A baby Millennial Dragon?!

65
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,112
[ERIC]
Get out of my way!

66
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:44,257
[LUFFY] "An Angry Showdown!
Cross the Red Line!"

67
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,565
[LUFFY]
You don't know when to quit!

68
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,901
Quiet, fool. You might have
stopped me temporarily,

69
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,103
but you'll never defeat me.

70
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,139
My, my. What a
most exquisite view!

71
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:03,009
It's positively
radiating with potential!

72
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,822
The Dragonite completely
surrounds us‐‐it's everywhere...

73
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,123
It's so beautiful...

74
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,124
[NAMI]
So what?!

75
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,993
Break open every
dragon fossil on the island.

76
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,428
It won't yield
your precious elixir!

77
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,864
Well, then, I'll just improvise.

78
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,500
Maybe, instead of wasting
my time with old fossils,

79
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,503
I'll just use some of the fresh
supply right in front of me.

80
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,372
Surely you must
realize that fighting me

81
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,375
would be an
exhausting lesson in futility.

82
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,210
Let's keep things simple
and split the treasure!

83
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,444
No thanks.

84
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,647
[ERIC] Fool! You're turning
your back on eternal life?!

85
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,514
[LUFFY]
Yep.

86
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,782
What's wrong with you?!

87
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,485
There's no one who'd pass up
the chance to stave off dying!

88
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,320
Don't let the fact that you
have Devil Fruit powers

89
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,856
lull you into illusions that
you can somehow cheat death

90
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,958
without the elixir
of immortality!

91
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,961
Even you have to
be afraid of dying!

92
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,664
I wouldn't bet on it.
Luffy will die smiling

93
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,199
if he accomplishes
what he's set out to do.

94
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,868
So back off.

95
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,969
[ERIC]
Very well.

96
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,537
I can accept that you
dragon lovers won't share

97
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,406
in the elixir of immortality.

98
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,308
But you shall still bear witness

99
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,377
as I rip the Dragonite
from their bodies.

100
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,478
No! Don't!

101
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,347
[ERIC]
Stop right there!

102
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,382
[USOPP]
Apis!

103
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,517
Why did you do that?!

104
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,086
[USOPP]
He'll rip you to shreds!

105
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,255
I don't care what happens to me!

106
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,357
I have to protect
the dragons nest

107
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,693
even if it costs me my life!

108
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,062
I can't let men
like him destroy it.

109
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:32,265
I won't let you hurt
these beautiful creatures!

110
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,538
So you continue to insist
on defying my every word?

111
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,207
Fine!

112
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,376
For that... all of you can die!

113
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,046
Sickle‐Sickle Whirlwind!

114
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,187
Luffy!

115
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,459
[ZORO]
Hmph.

116
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,196
Don't worry. I'll deal with him.

117
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,130
But, Luffy, you're hurt!

118
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,398
I made a promise!

119
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,267
You're fine with staying here?!
Well, I'm not.

120
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,569
You gotta fight back!

121
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,138
You haven't accomplished
your goal, remember?!

122
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,073
What happened to
going home to your nest?!

123
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,243
Don't give up on your dream
when you've gotten this close.

124
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,144
Sure, I will.

125
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,913
Don't worry about Apis.
I'll protect her.

126
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:24,717
[ERIC]
All right!

127
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,252
Sickle‐Sickle...

128
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,286
Gum‐Gum...

129
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,555
‐‐...Pistol!
‐‐...Whirlwind!

130
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,933
You'll have to do better
than that, rubberman!

131
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,473
Are my wind slashes
excruciating enough for you?

132
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,442
There is no escape
for you bouncy boy

133
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,278
so you might as
well accept your death.

134
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:55,281
Tell me hero,
how will you dodge this?

135
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,182
[ZORO]
This guy's pretty tough...

136
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,618
[USOPP] But, Luffy
can stop him... Right?!

137
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,453
Luffy...

138
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,757
[ERIC]
Sickle‐Sickle...

139
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,026
...Wind Slash!

140
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,363
Rapid Fire!

141
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,270
Quit hopping around
and let's finish this!

142
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,140
Do what you desire,
but this will not be pretty!

143
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,386
And a Gum‐Gum...

144
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,289
What is this?!

145
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,327
...Bell!

146
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,034
[LUFFY]
Now...

147
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,503
[LUFFY]
Bazooka!

148
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,578
You lose...

149
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,084
[APIS]
You did it!

150
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:13,359
[shocked sounds]

151
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,560
[ISLANDER C]
Unbelievable!

152
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,862
[ISLANDER D] I never thought
creatures like this existed,

153
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,430
but here they are!

154
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,099
[ISLANDER E] It wasn't
just a legend after all!

155
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,702
[NAMI]
Does anyone have an idea

156
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,538
how long this island
will stay at the surface.

157
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,607
I don't know...
But when it does sink again,

158
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,409
the Millennial Dragons are
probably gonna leave too, right?

159
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,212
They'll all fly away,
including the baby dragon.

160
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,847
I'll never see them again.

161
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,351
Well, now that that's done...

162
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:41,554
How 'bout a helping of my
special pork buns before you go?

163
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,389
[NAMI]
No! Thank you, but no!

164
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,225
We've gotta get back to our
journey right away! Right?!

165
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,126
I'm hungry...

166
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,628
I could use something to eat‐‐

167
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,232
Guess we'll just take
the recipe if you don't mind.

168
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,468
What a shame...
It won't take long...

169
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,402
And I can pass the time

170
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,238
by telling you the
legend of Lost Island.

171
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,541
The first king was
named Iscardunk

172
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,408
and his son...

173
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,277
[NAMI]
We've already heard about it!

174
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,384
[LUFFY] All right! Time to set
sail for the Grand Line!

175
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,289
Apis, you sure you
don't wanna come?

176
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,124
I've become friends
with each of you...

177
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,593
...and I'd love to be a
part of your next adventure...

178
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,829
However... my place
is on this island.

179
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,400
Grandpa Bokuden can
teach me all the rituals

180
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,236
and customs I'll need to
protect the dragons' nest,

181
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,772
just as my ancestors
did before me...!

182
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,608
That would be the
absolute best honor!

183
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,910
And someday, the baby
Millennial Dragons

184
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,947
that are hatching now will
return as full‐grown adults!

185
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,449
[USOPP] Yeah, that sounds
nice... Hey, hold on!

186
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,285
These baby dragons won't
be back for another, uhh...

187
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,454
...another thousand years!
That's crazy...

188
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,322
Give the girl a break!

189
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,424
Why do ya have to
be so damn cynical?!

190
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,792
Nuh‐uh. It's okay!

191
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,628
I understand, and it's
exactly what I'm expecting...

192
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,964
I won't live long enough
to see these dragons grow up,

193
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,199
but my children's children will!

194
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,801
That's why I have
to stay and guard them

195
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,637
until the next generation
comes along to relieve me!

196
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,672
Apis, that's pure crazy talk!

197
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,841
It was you guys who taught
me acting a little crazy

198
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,509
isn't such a bad thing!

199
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,278
I'm not crazy.

200
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,985
See... ya...! Take care!

201
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,886
[USOPP] Apis! I want
you to do me a favor!

202
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,722
Never forget about Usopp!

203
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,690
The bravest warrior of the sea!

204
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,726
Bye‐bye!

205
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,661
Goodbye, guys...

206
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,797
Take care... So long!!

207
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,699
[LUFFY]
Thanks for cooking, Apis!

208
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,667
[NAMI]
He didn't really mean that!

209
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,701
[USOPP]
Yes, he did!

210
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:36,168
‐‐[SANJI] We'll miss you!
‐‐[ZORO] Stay safe!

211
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:40,706
[APIS]
Bye...

212
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,847
[USOPP] Do you really
think she'll be able

213
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,849
to protect it all by herself?

214
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,851
I'm sure she'll
keep the nest safe.

215
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,919
Apis may be little,
but she's fearless

216
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,022
and determined to
protect the dragons.

217
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,556
Yeah, she'll be all right.

218
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,425
Nami's right, as always.

219
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,027
She'll be okay!

220
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,061
Yeah!

221
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,498
She was like a full‐blooded
member of this crew!

222
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,566
[ZORO]
She sure was.

223
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,075
[BOKUDEN] Are you sure
you didn't want to join them,

224
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,712
it's perfectly
natural, my dear.

225
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,013
No, I made the right choice.

226
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,582
If I'd gone with them,
I'd only be in the way.

227
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,051
Besides, I've found my purpose‐‐

228
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,119
something I really want to do!

229
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,058
[APIS] Before I met
Luffy and the others,

230
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,259
I don't know if
I would've been able

231
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,063
to take on the responsibility
of protecting Lost Island.

232
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,799
At first I didn't believe
in Lost Island either...

233
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,801
I thought it was just
a story and that's a fear

234
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,637
I didn't even feel
comfortable saying to myself,

235
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,572
so for strangers
like Luffy and his team

236
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,075
to risk everything
helping Grandpa Ryu.

237
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,876
It taught me what
it means to sacrifice

238
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,779
for a cause you truly
believe in and commit yourself

239
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,949
to saving a life even if
it means losing your own.

240
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,618
And now they've sailed off
to find what they believe in

241
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:04,623
and pursue it
together at any cost.

242
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,659
I've never seen people
that were so driven

243
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,260
and loyal to each other,

244
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,563
and the fact that
they accepted me,

245
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,966
filled me with such confidence,
that I'm sure of one thing!

246
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:18,137
I know I can achieve
anything I put my mind to!

247
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,641
He's asleep!

248
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,246
Hey there, so will you help me
make my dream come true?

249
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,850
Thank you! Together
we can make this happen!

250
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,818
[BOKUDEN] If you're going
to protect Lost Island,

251
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,187
you'll need to learn
about your ancestors,

252
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,657
but luckily I can
tell you all about it.

253
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,826
Well, in the beginning
there was the first king...

254
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,095
[APIS] I'm sorry, I really can't
take any more stories right now!

255
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,130
Thanks anyway!

256
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,197
[BOKUDEN]
Hold on, Apis!

257
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,165
Get back here!

258
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,133
[APIS]
Stop!

259
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,034
[BOKUDEN]
Listen child, this is important!

260
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,770
You must know about these
things!

261
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,972
[APIS]
No!

262
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,774
[BOKUDEN]
Apis!!

263
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,865
[SANJI]
Nami, my love! I have a report!

264
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,867
Major cloud cover ahead!

265
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,337
Big rain clouds!
There's a storm coming!

266
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,707
Oh, well, at least we're
back on our original course.

267
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:29,742
According to the map,

268
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,811
we should be spotting
the Red Line any time now.

269
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,984
Wow! We're almost there!
The Grand Line, at last!

270
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,886
Hehehe. Isn't this exciting?!

271
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,323
We're finally going!
We did it! We did it!

272
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,091
[SANJI]
Cut it out!

273
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,693
Sorry!

274
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,061
[LUFFY]
Zoro! Can you believe it?!

275
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,663
[NAMI thinking]
Can this be right?

276
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:53,065
Is the path to the Grand Line
really as perilous

277
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,366
as it's drawn here?

278
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,068
[ZORO]
Stop that!

279
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,370
[hums]

280
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,839
Hmm?

281
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,008
[NAMI]
Take a look!

282
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,044
[NAMI]
I'm familiar with the rumors,

283
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,213
and these drawings confirm it!

284
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,081
As unimaginable as it may seem,

285
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,350
the entrance to the
Grand Line is a mountain!

286
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,718
[LUFFY]
A mountain?!

287
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,253
[ZORO]
So what, do we crash into it?

288
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,354
[SANJI]
You gotta be kidding...

289
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,890
[NAMI] I didn't believe it,
but the map's clear...

290
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,259
The mountain appears to
be riddled with small canals,

291
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,795
so we might have
to go up and over it.

292
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,631
[LUFFY] Ooo!
Sounds like fun!

293
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,132
[ZORO]
What are you talking about...?!

294
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,934
Even if there are
canals or whatever,

295
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,270
a ship can't
climb up a mountain!

296
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,105
Well, the map says otherwise!

297
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,273
That's right!

298
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,774
And if Nami thinks something
can be done, then it can!

299
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:36,709
Got that?!

300
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,110
Yeah, but remember
that map was stolen

301
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,312
from Buggy the Clown...
So can we trust it?

302
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,281
[USOPP] In case no one's
noticed, the rudder's stuck!

303
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,750
A little help over
here would be nice!

304
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,119
[NAMI] Sanji! Will you
please give Usopp a hand?

305
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,088
I can't think with
all his shouting!

306
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,789
[SANJI]
Right away, Nami!

307
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,124
Okay!

308
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,895
Uh, does this current seem
unusually strong to anyone else?

309
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,130
[NAMI] Hmm?
Usopp! What did you just say?

310
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,298
I asked if any of you noticed

311
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,000
the insane strength
of this current!

312
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,402
The current... That must be...

313
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,470
What is it?

314
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,405
The canals do go
up the mountain!

315
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,807
[ZORO] Oh, come on...
How could that possibly work?

316
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:09,808
Look right here!

317
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,744
Ya see...? The guiding
light was directing us

318
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,479
toward this spot
on the Red Line...

319
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,415
Notice how it's labeled
here‐‐Reverse Mountain!

320
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,451
Hello...! Little help
over here thank you!

321
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,487
[NAMI] These green lines
represent canals,

322
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,088
or artificial waterways...

323
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,157
If major currents
from all four oceans

324
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,358
flow toward this mountain,

325
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,193
what do you
think's gonna happen?

326
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,796
The currents would force
water up these canals,

327
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:31,830
collide at the top,

328
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,333
and then flow straight
down into the Grand Line!

329
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,335
Now, Reverse Mountain
is a "winter mountain,"

330
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,603
so it's cold, right?

331
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,306
That means any surface currents
that don't flow up the canal

332
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,341
will be forced
down as they cool.

333
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,344
Anything riding those currents
would be pulled down as well.

334
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,980
If we screw up and miss
the entrance to the canal,

335
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,214
the Going Merry
will be carried straight

336
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,350
into the Red Line's rock face

337
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,519
and likely be destroyed.

338
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,787
Ship and crew would be sucked

339
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,222
to the bottom of
the sea. Understand?

340
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,357
[LUFFY]
Yeah...

341
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:02,494
Basically... it's a mystery
mountain! Ha. Ha. Ha.

342
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,331
[sighs] No, that's
not my point at all.

343
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,399
Anyways, since we're
positioned on this current,

344
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,034
we shouldn't run
into any problems

345
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,070
getting to the summit
of Reverse Mountain!

346
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,371
Only thing that
would hurt us now

347
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,039
is if something went
wrong with the rudder.

348
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,542
Nami, you're a genius...

349
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,878
Call me a skeptic, but ships
do not climb mountains.

350
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,413
Well, I've heard
a few stories...

351
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,515
Stories about the
"mystery mountain"?

352
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,683
[SANJI] No...

353
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,919
What I have heard is that
more than half of the people

354
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,054
who try to make it
to the Grand Line die

355
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,889
before they even get there.

356
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,758
Whatever we find,
it isn't going to be easy...

357
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,666
[NAMI]
Sanji! Could you get the sail?

358
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,601
[SANJI]
Anything for you Nami!

359
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,769
[SANJI]
Luffy! Help me!

360
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,340
Got it!

361
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,620
Hey...! I can see the
"mystery mountain"!

362
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,624
Aaah! That's insanely huge!

363
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,193
Wow, the entrance
to the Grand Line.

364
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,866
Haha! Oh, wow! Awesome!
It's bigger than I thought!

365
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,201
[USOPP]
I can't see the top!

366
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,271
It's taller than the clouds!

367
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,095
We're getting sucked in!

368
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,897
Hold the rudder steady!

369
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,565
[SANJI, USOPP]
We're on it!

370
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,135
[LUFFY]
Nami!

371
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,740
[LUFFY] Where's that entrance
you were talking about?!

372
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,744
If we keep this heading, we're
gonna crash into the rocks!

373
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,115
[NAMI]
There's a crack in that cliff...

374
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,350
That must be it.

375
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,487
Nami...! Give us a direction!

376
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,855
Keep bearing straight ahead!

377
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,423
You can't be serious!

378
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,192
Trust me!

379
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,426
Have we made it?

380
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,594
Is that the canal entrance?

381
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,329
More than likely!

382
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,165
I've gotta be dreaming!

383
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,867
It's impossible...

384
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,304
The ocean really is
flowing up the mountain!

385
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:29,608
[NAMI]
We have to make our way

386
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,810
through those water
gates just right.

387
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,347
Or we'll crash into the Red Line
and be smashed to pieces...

388
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,885
We're drifting off course!

389
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,653
Gotta go more
to the right! Right!

390
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,789
The right?! Move it starboard!

391
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,361
[USOPP] Come on, now!
Put your back into it!

392
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,736
[NAMI, ZORO, LUFFY]
The rudder!

393
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,306
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum Balloon!

394
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,485
[ZORO]
Luffy!

395
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,254
Grab ahold!

396
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:27,332
Yeah! Yeah! Yay!

397
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,368
[SANJI, USOPP]
We made it!

398
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,912
Now it's just a straight
shot to the summit!

399
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:40,846
[LUFFY]
Hey, I wanna see!

400
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,848
Hold on! I'm coming!

401
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,516
I'm free!

402
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,418
What'd I miss...? Wait for me!

403
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,759
Wow...! Great view!

404
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,701
[laughter]

405
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,703
[ERIC]
Curse you, damn pirates!

406
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,537
He's back.

407
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,705
It's the sicko guy...

408
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,372
Damn it...

409
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,907
Thought swirly head was dead...

410
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,708
Yeah I did too...

411
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:10,576
[ERIC]
Shut up!

412
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,945
I despise the
entire lot of you...!

413
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:13,912
Thanks to your meddling,

414
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,981
I have no chance of
obtaining Dragonite...!

415
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,050
That alone seals your doom!

416
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,218
At least I'll have
the satisfaction

417
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,987
of collecting the price on
your miserable little heads!

418
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,923
Make it easy on yourselves
and surrender at once!

419
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,593
Now what...?!

420
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,627
I hope somebody has a plan

421
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,762
because if he starts
using those wind slashes,

422
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,966
there's no telling
what he'll rip apart!

423
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,335
[ZORO]
We'll only get one shot at this.

424
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,770
[ERIC]
Hahahahaha!

425
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,806
You should see
the look on your faces!

426
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,277
You can't lay one
finger on me! Hahahahaha!

427
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,812
[NAMI]
Ahh, is that Dragonite?

428
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,817
[screams]

429
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,592
Bye‐bye!

430
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,928
Nice one...! Good thinking!

431
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,364
[NAMI] I'd be worried
he might show up again...

432
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,966
If I didn't know for a
fact that he can't swim!

433
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,368
With the strength
of this current,

434
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,103
being able to swim
wouldn't matter anyway!

435
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,771
That was so brave of you!

436
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,007
[SANJI, USOPP laugh]

437
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,875
[LUFFY]
Whoa! Look how high we are!

438
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,977
We're in the clouds!

439
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,956
[LUFFY]
This is insane!

440
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,694
We're not in the clouds,
we're above them!

441
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,406
It's amazing... We've done it!

442
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,974
We've reached the summit!

443
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,722
Wh‐hoo!!

444
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,491
Hahahaha!

445
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,744
[ZORO thinking] To be the
world's best swordsman...

446
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,747
[SANJI thinking]
To find the all blue...

447
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,750
[NAMI thinking] To draw a
map of the entire world...

448
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,886
[USOPP thinking] To become
a brave warrior of the sea!

449
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,125
[LUFFY]
I can see it!

450
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,095
This is the greatest sea
in the whole world!

451
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,930
The Grand Line!

452
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,867
Somewhere out there
the One Piece is waiting,

453
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,869
and we're gonna find it!

454
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,372
[LUFFY]
Let's go!

455
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,951
<i>♪All that's in</i>
<i>my heart confuses me</i>

456
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,953
<i>I cannot understand</i>

457
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:10,055
<i>As I face what I must do</i>

458
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,824
<i>I'll say goodbye</i>
<i>and squeeze your hand</i>

459
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,626
<i>I'll set sail alone</i>

460
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,896
<i>But always know</i>
<i>I'm gonna keep you near</i>

461
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,631
<i>As I drift away</i>

462
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:23,402
<i>I pray you watch me</i>
<i>as I disappear</i>

463
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,108
<i>As I watch the sunrise</i>

464
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,644
<i>I began to wonder</i>

465
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:37,582
<i>What could be the reason</i>

466
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,818
<i>No answer has come</i>

467
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:43,922
<i>But I can't get away</i>

468
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:48,794

00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,665
<i>Get 'em to come back to me</i>

00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,167
<i>I'll do what I must</i>

472
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,603
<i>Because they're</i>

473
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,772
<i>Wrap these arms around my dreams</i>

474
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,275
<i>And pull 'em back from yesterday</i>

475
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,778

476
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,614
<i>I'm sure that we can</i>

477
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,624
[SANJI]
Nami! I see a mountain up ahead!

478
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,526
[LUFFY]
Who cares...?! Go!

479
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,494
[NAMI]
That's impossible!

480
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,529
The map shows nothing
but ocean up ahead!

481
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,664
[LUFFY]
Wha‐‐ It's a black wall!

482
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:28,133
[ZORO] Hurry! We gotta do
something before we crash!

483
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,634
[NAMI]
No...! It's a‐‐

484
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,702
[LUFFY]
A whale!

485
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:31,870
[USOPP]
A whale?!

486
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,638
[ALL]
Aaaaah!

487
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,140
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

488
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,042
"The First Line of Defense?

I'm gonna be
