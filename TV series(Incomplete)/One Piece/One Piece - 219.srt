1
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,215
[thinking]
Wait, that's it!

2
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,251
[crash]

3
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,119
I never thought of that!

4
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,721
Gum-Gum Pistol!

5
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,730
[NARRATOR] The final round of
the Davy Back Fight rages on.

6
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,232
Atop the deck of Foxy's ship,

7
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,368
the epic battle between the
two captains reaches a climax!

8
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,540
Luffy!

9
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:25,713
[LUFFY] I won't let you take
a single member of my crew...

10
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,614
...even if it kills me!

11
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,232
Straw Hat is back
on his feet yet again!

12
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,034
What a guy!

13
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,402
He may fall...

14
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,536
Luffy.

15
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,506
[ITOMIMIZU] ...but he gets
right back up every time!

16
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,575
[panting heavily]

17
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,410
Why can't you just stay down?

18
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,245
You'll kill yourself!

19
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,448
Luffy!!

20
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,317
[TOMIMIZU]
He's battered and bruised.

21
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,485
Luffy!

22
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,221
[ITOMIMIZU] He's tired
and out of breath.

23
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,722
[RANDOM FOXY A]
Don't give up!

24
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:13,494
[ITOMIMIZU] And yet
he still stands tall

25
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,630
with a glimmer in his eye!

26
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,533
All for the sake
of his friends!

27
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,635
Now this is a
Davy Back Fight!

28
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,470
I don't know what to say...

29
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,639
I... I'm so teary-eyed
I can't see straight!

30
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,107
Ya-ha-ha-ha!

31
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,776
Luffy!

32
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,811
We love you!

33
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,313
I'm gonna cry!

34
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,682
You rock!

35
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,417
[FOXY CREW C]
You can do it!

36
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,153
[CROWD]
Luffy! Luffy! Luffy!

37
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,688
[ITOMIMIZU]
The crowd has spoken!

38
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,823
Straw Hat has
touched our hearts!

39
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:45,626
No one has ever lasted
this long against our boss!

40
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,228
No one has ever
shown so much courage!

41
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,230
Grrrr...

42
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,632
You idiots! Jeez!

43
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:56,036
Don't you realize you're
cheering for the enemy?!

44
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,137
C'mon, Boss!

45
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,639
Boss!

46
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:03,277
[CROWD cheers] C'mon Boss!
C'mon Boss! C'mon Boss!

47
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,147
Just you wait!
I'll end this soon!

48
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,387
Slow-Slow Beam Sword!

49
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,388
You'll have to do
better than that!

50
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,126
Oh no! He can't dodge!

51
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,295
His poor legs are
too worn out to run!

52
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,398
It's too cruel!
I can't stand to watch!

53
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,301
Here let me
put you to rest!

54
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,536
Slow-Slow Beam!

55
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,771
[ITOMIMIZU] Boss
goes on the offensive!

56
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:34,608
He slowed down a
cannonball, but to what end?

57
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,244
Flying Foxy Fighter!

58
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,746
Watch out for my flying fists!

59
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,349
They're gonna knock you out
at the speed of a cannonball!

60
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,218
[ITOMIMIZU] He's using
the Flying Foxy Fighter

61
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,519
to finish his foe!

62
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:46,520
It may be slow now,

63
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,390
but once the beam wears
off, there's no escape!

64
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,558
Listen!

65
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,260
He used his beam on you a
few seconds before the ball!

66
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,162
Dodge as soon as
you're back to normal!

67
00:04:56,596 --> 00:05:01,168
Feh-feh-feh-feh!

68
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,469
[LUFFY]
I can move!

69
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,373
[ITOMIMIZU] Oh! Straw Hat
recovers but is it too late?

70
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,175
Nice try but I'm too fast!

71
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,284
Watch out, that
thing's about to blow!

72
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,453
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

73
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,489
Here you go a parting gift.

74
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,426
[ITOMIMIZU]
A direct hit! Ow!

75
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,061
I don't think Straw Hat will
be getting up from that one!

76
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,299
Oh no! Luffy!

77
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,503
[CROWD]
Boss! Boss! Boss!

78
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,073
That jerk is he
trying to kill him?!

79
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:45,646
Huuuh?

80
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,416
[ITOMIMIZU]
He, he, he, he's back up!

81
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,153
But how?!

82
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,140
[LUFFY]
You're going down.

83
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,244
Is that so?!

84
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,579
And how do you
plan beat me

85
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,514
if you can't even
stand up straight?

86
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,516
But never mind, if
that's how you want it.

87
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,518
Then I'll just have
to pound your face in,

88
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,653
until you stay down for good!

89
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:28,355
Megaton Nine Tails...

90
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,457
Now, Gum-Gum...

91
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,093
...Rush!

92
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,728
...Gatling!

93
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,468
[ITOMIMIZU]
Such intensity!

94
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,703
Both fighters are unleashing

95
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,806
a flurry of fists at
lightning speed!

96
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,409
Go! Slaughter that fox!

97
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,277
You can do it!

98
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,713
So fast!
So Strong! So brutal!

99
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,697
Slow-Slow Beam!

100
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,765
[CROWD gasps in surprise]

101
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,302
Wait, what?

102
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,070
He stopped moving.

103
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:36,657
I... I think Straw Hat
is beat! No, wait!

104
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,826
He's on his knees,
but he's still moving!

105
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:42,196
Unlike our boss, who's standing
but strangely frozen in place!

106
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,232
Noooooo...

107
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:45,833
How did he?

108
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:49,135
Gah! Oh no! Boss!

109
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,706
[ITOMIMIZU]
It's a mirror!

110
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,143
A piece of a mirror has
fallen from Straw Hat's hand!

111
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:59,179
It was stuck in my afro.

112
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,049
I got it when
I broke the mirror.

113
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,552
Nooooooo...

114
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,121
Gum-Gum...

115
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,797
...Flail!

116
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,593
Boss, no!

117
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:46,694
Ha! Eight seconds.

118
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,463
Ha? Huh?

119
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:52,399
Could this be the end?!

120
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,235
Seven seconds.

121
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,468
'Til what?

122
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,506

00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,675
Say it ain't so!

124
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:08,616
Wa-ha-ha-ha! Five!!

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,150
Hey! C'mon you guys,

00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:14,521
don't just sit there-count
along with me! Four!

All right, we're almost at the
end--everyone together now!

Up goes our boss!

00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,450
High into the sky!

he finally comes down

Outside the battlefield!

of the Davy Back Fight
has come to an end!

148

After an epic battle
between captains,

our boss' legendary record
of 920 wins and 0 losses

00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,055
has been broken!

...even if it kills me!

153
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:14,074

it for Straw Hat Luffy!

He won! He did it!

[bell ding]

158
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,388
Our boss really lost.

159
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,423

seen it all today, folks.

160

sit there, guys!

He needs me, too!

166

[ITOMIMIZU] The Davy Back
Giant has been toppled

167
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,672
and the boy with the tiny
crew and the massive afro

168
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,707
has seized the day
in a grand fashion!

You'll poke him to death!

Yeah, afro power, my butt.

177
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,409

if I've ever seen one.

disrespect the afro, here.

00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,216
[CHOPPER]
Look! He's waking up!

180
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,419
Where am I? What happened?

181
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,755
Is it over? Did I win?

182
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,691
That wasn't just a
dream was it? Was it?

183
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,594
You don't need to
freak out. You beat him.

184
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:46,199
[sighs]
What a relief.

185
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:52,139
Everyone else said
you'd lose but not me.

186
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,206
You're a bad liar.

187
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,342
Guess it would of been
a real pain if you'd lost.

188
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,579
Imagine being stuck on a
boat with Foxy. Screw that.

189
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,146
[ROBIN chuckles]

190
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:01,948
[RANDOM FOXY G]
Boss, wait!

191
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,651
[RANDOM FOXY H]
You gotta take it easy!

192
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:05,552
Hey Rubber Boy,

193
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,222
I was pretty attached to
that win streak of mine.

194
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,391
I'm not pleased
about you ruining it.

195
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:12,125
[FOXY CREW]
Boss, no!

196
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:15,429
I'm kidding, brother.
Let's shake.

197
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,163
[RANDOM FOXY I]
What a man!

198
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,030
[RANDOM FOXY J]
He's the best!

199
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:20,267
[RANDOM FOXY K]
You're too kind, Boss!

200
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,169
[chuckles]

201
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,036
[LUFFY]
Hmm?

202
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,773
Hi ya! Taste my
Shoulder Throw of Spite!

203
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,376
[FOXY CREW]
Oh no!

204
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,245
[ZORO] This guy's a
real piece of work.

205
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,746
[FOXY] You forget
the rules already?

206
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,616
C'mon You've got 500
new crewmates to choose!

207
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,550
He's right!

208
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:40,354
We haven't made the
final exchange yet!

209
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,555
Chopper! Robin!

210
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,757
[sobbing hysterically]

211
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,595
[LUFFY chuckles]

212
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:51,832
I'm so happy!
Thank you. Thank you!

213
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,368
Here your mask.
You can have it back now.

214
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:57,504
Straw Hat starts out
with two obvious choices.

215
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:01,208
The question is, who's next?
Don't leave us hanging!

216
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:03,611
Guess I'll take your flag!

217
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:05,713
[FOXY CREW]
What?!

218
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:07,281
You monster!

219
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,316
You'd strip my poor
crew of their livelihood

220
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,551
without a second thought?!

221
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,353
I don't need your sail!

222
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:15,522
You gotta use that thing
to go places, after all.

223
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,258
[RANDOM FOXY L]
You hear that? We're saved!

224
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,092
[FOXY CREW H]
That's nice and all,

225
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,227
but I'm afraid
it's not that easy.

226
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,630
We have a flag
on our sail too.

227
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,064
[FOXY CREW I]
We don't need your pity!

228
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,800
You won fair and
square, so take it!

229
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:27,867
I got a plan.

230
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,137
I don't actually have to
take the sail off the boat

231
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,306
as long as I can take
the mark off the sail

232
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,707
and I can do that with paint.

233
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,642
Once you have a new flag,

234
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:36,644
you should be fine, right?

235
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:39,713
Thank you Straw Hat.
Your kindness is...

236
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:40,180
[LUFFY]
There.

237
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,715
[FOXY]
Ahh...!

238
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,151
[FOXY CREW]
It sucks!

239
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,420
Aw, you guys don't
have to bow to me!

240
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:47,787
We're not!

241
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,625
[ITOMIMIZU]
Whoa, hold on a second!

242
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:55,529
You still have another
497 crew members to pick!

243
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,630
We don't need any more.

244
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,265
The rules are the rules!

245
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,067
I don't care if
you need them or not.

246
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,169
You're gonna pick those
crew mates right now!

247
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,804
Aw... Do I have to?

248
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,140
[FOXY] Of course you do!
Stop complaining!

249
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:07,207
Aw...

250
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:09,743
Hey Luffy, a crew follows
their captain's orders

251
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,812
no matter what, remember?

252
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,447
Yes, good point.

253
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,215
That makes it easy!

254
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,686
Easy? What is?

255
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:21,087
I got it. No problem.

256
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,591
Now. Let's see.

257
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,627
You!

258
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,062
Me? Really?

259
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,630
Yep. Everyone from you...

260
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,171
...to you.

261
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:37,905
Me?

262
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,540
[LUFFY]
How many people is that?

263
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:40,507
We have 500 total.

264
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,110
So excluding our Boss,
Hamburg and Porche,

265
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,646
that should leave us with--

266
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,082
Oh, that's four ninety
seven exactly.

267
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,117
Well, there you
go, it's settled.

268
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,218
Captain Luffy!

269
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,686
Nice! Thanks!

270
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,954
[fireworks blasts]

271
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,557
[ITOMIMIZU] Well folks, this is
Itomimizu signing off for today,

272
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,294
and signing on as the
Straw Hat's brand new MC!

273
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:04,064
[FOXY CREW] Three cheers
for the New Straw Hat Pirates!

274
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:04,898
[FORMER NAVIGATOR]
I hate to say this,

275
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:05,765
but no matter
how you look at it,

276
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,035
the Merry can't
hold this many people.

277
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,236
[FORMER DOCTOR]
Ah, it's no big deal.

278
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,171
We'll just follow
along in the Sexy Foxy

279
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,339
'til we work something out.

280
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,340
[FORMER CAPTAIN]
Good point!

281
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,377
[FORMER CREW chuckles]

282
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,078
You'll do no such thing!

283
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,748
The Sexy Foxy is my ship,
you miserable ingrates!

284
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:21,649
Your ship, eh?

285
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:23,384
I'd like to see the
three of them run

286
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,685
that huge ship by themselves.

287
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:26,153
They wouldn't last a week.

288
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,222
Yeah! Fat chance!

289
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:29,423
Aaahhhh...

Puh! Fat chance.
Puh-puh-puh!

Awwww!

292
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,596
Then go, you jerks!

Hey! Rubber boy!

00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:50,611
I'll make you pay
for this! Just wait!

299
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:52,813
[ZORO] That's supposed
to be a joke, right?

300
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,049
Okay! Listen, men!

301
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,584
It's time for your

302
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:59,253
of the new Straw

303
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,554
Are you guys ready?

00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,398
You mean you're
kicking us off?

[LUFFY]
Yep. You got it

311
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,368
[ZORO]
A captain's orders are absolute

312
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:16,503
so I don't wanna hear
anyone complaining.

313
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,439
[LUFFY] I don't care if you
join your old crews again

314
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:19,807
or if you go back
to Split Head,

315
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,776
but whatever you do,
you can't stay with me!

316
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:23,810
So long!

That's right, Shelly.

Don't be afraid, girl.
The bad guys are gone.

00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,604
I know what you're thinking

326
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,773
but I won't ride on
stilts ever again.

327
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,742
We'll catch up
to the village, too.

328
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:57,344
I don't care how
many years it takes us.

329
00:17:58,345 --> 00:17:59,480
Huh?

330
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:01,181
[TONJIT]
You made it back!

331
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,287
[LUFFY]
We brought you a souvenir.

332
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:15,462
You're hurt. Are you all right?

333
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,597
Oh, this? It's nothing.

334
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,768
Thank you for your help.

[neighing]

336
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:27,608
[NAMI] Is that why
you accepted the fight?

337
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:29,310
Because you wanted to help him?

338
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:31,812
And here I thought you were
just being stupid again.

339
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,814

Man, you're rude!

00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:42,623
Wha... What's happening?!

[frightened neighing]

343
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,361
[CHOPPER]
Guys, I don't like this!

344
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:49,563
It's huge! What is that?!

345
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,632
[LITTONTO] I might ask
you the same question!

346
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:53,634
Whoa, you mean
that thing can talk?!

347
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:56,303
[LITTONTO] I'm not a
thing! I'm a moooole!

348
00:18:56,336 --> 00:19:00,541
"Moooole," you say?
I don't get it.

349
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:04,612
I'm the champion! You dig?

350
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,313
[NAMI]
Great. Another weirdo.

351
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,815
[SANJI]
Champion of what?!

352
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:10,251
[LITTONTO]
You really need to ask?

353
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:13,320
Obviously, I'm the world
champion of hole-digging!

354
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,254
As crazy as it sounds,

355
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,724
I'm challenging my
own record as we speak!

356
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:19,727
That's no excuse for wrecking
the old stilts guy's house!

357
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,096
Where's he
supposed to live?!

358
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:23,797
Huh?

359
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,500
[LITTONTO]
What old stilts guy?

360
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:34,775
[TONJIT] They call this
a mooole, you like him?

361
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:35,909
Listen, Littonto,

362
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:39,079
I'm about to go for the
world record in stilt-standing.

363
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,347
[LITTONTO]
Huh?

364
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,181
It won't be easy,

365
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,484
so I may be up
there for a few days

366
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:47,321
but at least you'll have the
moooole to keep you company.

367
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,123
You can manage
while I'm gone, right?

368
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:51,792
[LITTONTO] Uh-huh! I'll
wait as long as I have to

369
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:54,662
but you better come back
a champion, okay, Grandpa?

370
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,764
[TONJIT] You bet
I will! Don't you worry!

371
00:19:56,797 --> 00:20:00,067
I promise I'll
make you proud!

372
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,504
It can't be.
It's really you?

373
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,472
Well, of course!

374
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:06,340
Grandpa!

375
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,741
Littonto!

376
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:10,110
[LITTONTO]
I missed you so much!

377
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:12,313
I was so lonely without you!

378
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:14,148
You turned into
a fine young man!

379
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:17,651
I'm so sorry I didn't
get to watch you grow up!

380
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:21,689
I didn't mean to worry you.
I hope you can forgive me!

381
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,490
[USOPP]
I didn't see that one coming.

382
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,126
[LITTONTO] When I thought
about how hard my grandpa

383
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,062
was working on
his world-record,

384
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:30,698
it inspired me to start
on a record of my own!

385
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,499
And suddenly,
before I knew it,

386
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,469
all my loneliness turned into
a passion for hole-digging!

387
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,238
And now you're the champ.

388
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:40,441
[LITTONTO] Yep! I'm gonna
dig through the whole world!

389
00:20:40,474 --> 00:20:41,508
[LUFFY]
Hahaha!

390
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:44,545
You aim big, huh?
Just like the old stilts guy!

391
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,347
[TONJIT]
Yeah?

392
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,448
[USOPP]
That's not a compliment.

393
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:50,217
[ALL laughs]

394
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,319
[ROBIN] Say, couldn't you
follow one of your holes

395
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,121
to reach the
other villagers?

396
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:55,188
[ALL]
Huh?

397
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,693
[LUFFY] Looks like it
all worked out, huh?

398
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,528
[TONJIT] Yes,
I don't know how

399
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,163
to thank you for
all you've done.

400
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,231
[LUFFY chuckles]

401
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,699
Don't worry about it!

402
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:06,767
Thanks a lot, ma'am!

403
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,202
If you hadn't
said something,

404
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:09,503
I probably would've
been waiting

405
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,605
for years to see
the other villagers!

406
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:18,578
Farewell, my friends!
I won't forget you!

407
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:21,115
[TONJIT]
Again, thank you so much!

408
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:24,151
[USOPP] Take care on
your way home, old man!

409
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:25,252
[TONJIT]
You too!

410
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:29,155
Wherever you may go,
I pray for your safe journey!

411
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,559
That's that.
Time to head off.

412
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,628
Nami, is the
Log ready yet?

413
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,730
Sure is! We're all good to go!

414
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,433
All right, it's about time.

415
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,668
Yeah.

416
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:41,669
So... What now?

417
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:44,037
Are we gonna snag
us a shipwright?

418
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,143
Yeah! Just hold on, Merry!

419
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:54,281
We'll find a shipwright
to fix you up in no time!

420
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,549
[CREW]
Yeah!

421
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:02,689
♪ ending song ♪

422
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:16,530
[LUFFY] Ummmm, what
was I doing again?

423
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,664
[SANJI] Who are
these weirdoes?

424
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:20,134
[NAMI] Why am I on a ship
with a bunch of pirates?!

425
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,769
[CHOPPER] Who?
What? Where am I?

426
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,404
[ROBIN] Don't tell me
you've lost your memories!

427
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:25,272
[USOPP] Ahhh!
My head! My head!

428
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:26,273
[ROBIN]
What's wrong, Long-nose?!

429
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:27,007
[USOPP]
It itches!

430
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,609
[ZORO] Shut up!
Nobody cares!

431
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:30,311
[LUFFY] On the
next <i>One Piece</i> :

432
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:33,180
"Was it Lost?
Stolen? Who are You?"

433
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:35,749
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
