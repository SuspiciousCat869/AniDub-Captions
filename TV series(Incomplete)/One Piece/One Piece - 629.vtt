00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.980
why we were being pursued.

00:10:57.014 --> 00:10:59.952
However, I will say that
our original destination

00:10:59.986 --> 00:11:02.257
was a place called "Zou."

00:11:02.291 --> 00:11:03.192
Zou?

00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:05.296
[KIN'EMON]
Huh? You know it, Sir Law?

00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:07.434
That's a rather
convenient coincidence.

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:10.440
After I hand off Caesar, and
destroy the SMILE factory,

00:11:10.473 --> 00:11:11.610
like we planned,

00:11:11.643 --> 00:11:14.281
Zou was gonna be the
next stop on my trip.

00:11:14.314 --> 00:11:15.984
Is that so? Truly?

00:11:16.018 --> 00:11:19.626
Yeah. My crew's there.
They've been waiting.

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:20.995
[BROOK belches]

00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:22.665
Rosa!

00:11:22.698 --> 00:11:25.537
I-If so, would it be possible
to accompany you there

00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:27.575
after our current mission?

00:11:27.609 --> 00:11:31.115
Me, too! We'll all go to
Wano! That'll be cool!

00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:32.117
Enough!

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.423
[KIN'EMON grunts]
Thank you! Thank you!

00:11:35.457 --> 00:11:37.327
Uh, sure.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.068
Sir Luffy, you have my
gratitude for all you've done!

00:11:41.102 --> 00:11:42.037
And mine!

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.441
[LUFFY chuckles]
Hey, don't mention it!

00:11:44.474 --> 00:11:45.878
Right, Traffy?

00:11:45.911 --> 00:11:47.113
--[farts]
--[NAMI] Huh?

00:11:47.147 --> 00:11:48.148
[BROOK]
Uhh...

00:11:49.686 --> 00:11:53.125
Momonosuke and three brave
samurai, including myself,

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:56.198
were headed to Zou before our
ship was sadly destroyed.

00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:58.269
I, Momonosuke and
another samurai,

00:11:58.302 --> 00:12:00.340
managed to make it to Dressrosa.

00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:03.847
Once there, we... we were
assaulted by Doflamingo

00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:05.551
and his villainous troupe.

00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:09.057
Panicked, I took refuge
on a ship, a dire mistake.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.663
[MOMONOSUKE]
There, I met some children

00:12:11.696 --> 00:12:13.466
being taken to Punk Hazard.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.905
Soon, I shared in
their terrible fate,

00:12:15.938 --> 00:12:19.044
though I had no idea what I
was in store for at the time.

00:12:19.078 --> 00:12:22.851
--[MOMONOSUKE] Father!
--[KIN'EMON] Momonosuke! No!

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:25.423
Surrounded, and quite desperate
to follow the ship,

00:12:25.457 --> 00:12:28.964
I relied on the brave assistance
of my fellow samurai, Kanjuro.

00:12:28.997 --> 00:12:33.607
[KANJURO] Spare not a thought
for me! Protect Momonosuke!

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.311
[KIN'EMON sobs]

00:12:36.345 --> 00:12:40.019
If not for his sacrifice,
then all would have been lost.

00:12:40.052 --> 00:12:42.725
I simply cannot
leave him to die!

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:46.232
I must return to save him!

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:49.004
You're a real bro, Kanjuro!

00:12:49.037 --> 00:12:50.273
Kanjuro!

00:12:50.307 --> 00:12:52.845
Okay, we'll help you
save him! No prob!

00:12:52.878 --> 00:12:56.018
That's enough! Stay focused!
Stick to our plan!

00:12:56.052 --> 00:12:58.823
[CHOPPER, FRANKY, LUFFY]
Kanjuro!

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.119
[BABY 5] We're still waiting
for Master Trebol to arrive.

00:13:30.153 --> 00:13:31.488
[DOFLAMINGO]
Very well.

00:13:31.522 --> 00:13:33.927
[door creaking]

00:13:44.515 --> 00:13:47.855
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:13:47.888 --> 00:13:49.825
The wait is over.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.814
[BRANDNEW]
The Seven Warlords of the Sea.

00:14:33.847 --> 00:14:36.653
That's why we're here today.

00:14:36.687 --> 00:14:40.193
As you know, they are pirates
who are excused of their crimes

00:14:40.226 --> 00:14:42.297
by order of the World
Government itself.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.703
In return, they provide us
with two things:

00:14:44.736 --> 00:14:47.140
overwhelming strength
and intimidation.

00:14:47.173 --> 00:14:48.176
In other words,

00:14:48.209 --> 00:14:50.213
although they may be
fearsome criminals,

00:14:50.246 --> 00:14:51.783
the World Government weaponizes

00:14:51.817 --> 00:14:54.555
their prowess to keep
other pirates in check.

00:14:54.589 --> 00:14:56.926
First, the world's
greatest swordsman:

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.197
"Hawk-Eye" Dracule Mihawk.

00:15:01.536 --> 00:15:03.272
[BRANDNEW]
The king of Dressrosa

00:15:03.306 --> 00:15:06.044
and a devilish puppeteer:

00:15:06.078 --> 00:15:09.585
"The Heavenly Demon,"
Don Quixote Doflamingo.

00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:12.090
Now, the Navy's human weapon:

00:15:12.123 --> 00:15:14.995
"The Tyrant," Bartholomew Kuma.

00:15:16.733 --> 00:15:19.071
[BRANDNEW]
The ruler of Amazon Lily.

00:15:19.104 --> 00:15:21.742
"Pirate Empress," Boa Hancock.

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.116
[BRANDNEW]
A member of the Worst Generation

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:28.189
and the mastermind behind
the Rocky Port Incident:

00:15:28.222 --> 00:15:31.128
"The Surgeon of Death,"
Trafalgar Law.

00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:33.600
And last, the founder
and Chief Commander

00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:36.071
of the Pirate Dispatch
Organization--

00:15:36.104 --> 00:15:40.747
a former crewmate of Roger,
whose fame continues to grow.

00:15:42.518 --> 00:15:45.791
[BRANDNEW]
"The Genius Jester," Buggy!

00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:47.493
[BUGGY]
What? You chumps didn't think

00:15:47.528 --> 00:15:50.166
I had what it takes
to be a Warlord?

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.103
[laughing]

00:15:52.137 --> 00:15:54.174
I guess that shows
what you know, huh?

00:15:54.207 --> 00:15:56.378
Honestly, I didn't
even want the gig.

00:15:56.411 --> 00:15:57.548
But they begged.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:16:00.186
Crawling on their hands and
knees and everything!

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.758
Really! What could I say?

00:16:04.094 --> 00:16:07.300
[BUGGY] But all of this
is merely the beginning.

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:09.506
'Cause once Captain Buggy
gets the ball rolling,

00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:12.678
ain't no one gonna stop it.

00:16:12.712 --> 00:16:19.157
Soon, it'll be "Emperor Buggy,"
then I am gonna be King of the--

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.296
All right, those six,
along with the other guy,

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.738
are Warlords.
At least, they were.

00:16:25.771 --> 00:16:29.512
That changed this morning.
Rather unexpectedly.

00:16:29.546 --> 00:16:32.585
We don't know why,
but Doflamingo quit.

00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:34.955
Also, Law's under investigation.

00:16:34.989 --> 00:16:37.928
It looks like we might have
to expel him from the group.

00:16:37.961 --> 00:16:39.064
This is no good!

00:16:39.097 --> 00:16:41.468
We need them to help
balance the power between

00:16:41.503 --> 00:16:43.438
the Four Emperors and us!

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.799
[AKAINU] Don't worry, Brandnew.
We're all on the same page here.

00:16:58.837 --> 00:17:00.172
[BRANDNEW]
Fleet Admiral!

00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:02.476
[AKAINU] I'm not gonna
let Law and Straw Hat

00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:04.749
make a mess of things
on my watch.

00:17:04.783 --> 00:17:07.755
Besides, I already
had Smoker from G-5

00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:10.560
screaming my ear off
in his last report.

00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:16.572
That's when I said, "enough."
I sent in Fujitora.

00:17:18.442 --> 00:17:19.812
[MAN F]
Your majesty!

00:17:19.845 --> 00:17:22.116
[WOMAN A]
Please don't abandon us!

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.220
[MAN G]
Tell us it isn't true!

00:17:24.254 --> 00:17:27.427
[MAN H] Say something, your
majesty, we're begging you!

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.333
[WOMAN B]
Just a word! Anything!

00:17:30.366 --> 00:17:34.107
[BABY 5]
Master Trebol?

00:17:34.141 --> 00:17:37.013
Hey! C'mon! Where are you?

00:17:37.047 --> 00:17:39.150
Huh?

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.055
Have you seen him, Sugar?

00:17:41.088 --> 00:17:42.189
Nuh-uh.

00:17:42.223 --> 00:17:43.192
[BABY 5]
Darn it.

00:17:43.225 --> 00:17:45.964
The young master
has a plan. I'm sure.

00:17:45.997 --> 00:17:48.302
I just hope it involves
a lot of fight-een!

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:50.908
C'mon, Navy! Let's throw down!

00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:54.347
Perhaps. It's pointless
to speculate now.

00:17:54.381 --> 00:17:57.688
[BABY 5]
Master Trebol? Hello?

00:17:59.257 --> 00:18:04.200
[TREBOL]
Oh! Hey, Baby 5! Looking for me?

00:18:04.233 --> 00:18:06.706
Uh? What are you doing up there?

00:18:06.739 --> 00:18:10.012
Wow! That crowd, they look mad!

00:18:10.045 --> 00:18:14.622
Yeah. I bet the whole
world's goin' crazy!

00:18:14.656 --> 00:18:16.392
Hey, hey!

00:18:16.425 --> 00:18:20.767
So, I heard the news!
You got a fiancé!

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.871
Or you got him killed at least!

00:18:22.904 --> 00:18:25.209
[TREBOL laughs]

00:18:25.242 --> 00:18:28.282
[BABY 5] Ugh. Haven't you ever
heard of personal space?

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:29.785
Jeez, you're so annoying.

00:18:29.819 --> 00:18:36.799
Annoying. But... Eh?
Annoying but what? Hey? What?

00:18:36.832 --> 00:18:41.107
But... you like me? Is that it?

00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:42.778
[BABY 5]
Would you drop this already?

00:18:42.812 --> 00:18:44.381
The Young Master
was calling you.

00:18:44.414 --> 00:18:46.385
[TREBOL]
Why, whatever for?

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:50.861
[BABY 5] He wants you to bring
the thing. Now please, go away.

00:18:50.894 --> 00:18:52.263
[TREBOL]
Hey, hey, hey.

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.101
You gotta pick
your fiancés better,

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.404
or Doffy's just gonna
keep killing them!

00:18:56.438 --> 00:18:58.877
But you know who Doffy
doesn't want to kill?

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.213
Me! And you know who's single

00:19:00.246 --> 00:19:02.383
and would make a
good husband? Also me!

00:19:02.416 --> 00:19:03.853
[BABY 5 gasping]

00:19:07.126 --> 00:19:08.797
[laughs]

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.836
[BABY 5 groaning]

00:19:13.707 --> 00:19:16.478
[TREBOL]
Just yankin' yer chain!

00:19:16.512 --> 00:19:19.083
[laughs]

00:19:20.788 --> 00:19:24.027
[BABY 5] If you really
need me... I don't mind.

00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:25.697
[ALL]
Stop that!

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:32.276
[DOFLAMINGO] The Colosseum
is packed, as usual.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.751
Thanks for your
hard work, Diamante.

00:19:35.784 --> 00:19:38.422
[DIAMANTE]
The credit is all yours, Doffy.

00:19:38.455 --> 00:19:42.364
This country owes everything
to its beloved king.

00:19:42.397 --> 00:19:47.708
"Beloved"? They're quite
fond of you, too.

00:19:47.741 --> 00:19:50.848
[DIAMANTE] Stop, you make
it sound like I'm the hero

00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:51.882
of the Colosseum.

00:19:51.916 --> 00:19:53.252
[DOFLAMINGO]
Enough with the modesty.

00:19:53.285 --> 00:19:54.689
That's exactly what you are.

00:19:54.722 --> 00:19:56.793
[DIAMANTE]
No, no, I'm nothing of the sort.

00:19:56.826 --> 00:19:58.195
Fine then. You're not.

00:19:58.228 --> 00:20:00.734
All right, I'm a hero,
guilty as charged!

00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:05.343
A hero, fearless and invincible,
but you didn't hear me say that!

00:20:05.376 --> 00:20:09.585
[TREBOL]
Hey, hey, hey.

00:20:09.619 --> 00:20:13.159
I brought the thing you
asked for! Doffy. Doffy.

00:20:13.192 --> 00:20:14.528
You're too close.

00:20:14.562 --> 00:20:17.033
Too close, but what?

00:20:17.066 --> 00:20:20.707
But I like it. Now, sit.

00:20:22.109 --> 00:20:24.715
[TREBOL laughs]

00:20:24.748 --> 00:20:27.020
When Straw Hat
finds out about this,

00:20:27.053 --> 00:20:28.556
he'll do anything to get it.

00:20:28.589 --> 00:20:31.194
Then, he'll be mine to control.

00:20:31.227 --> 00:20:36.238
And his new friend Law will
be dragged down with him.

00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:40.413
Diamante. I'm going
to entrust this to you.

00:20:40.446 --> 00:20:43.218
[DIAMANTE] I couldn't possibly.
It's far too important.

00:20:43.251 --> 00:20:46.258
It's fine. You'll know
exactly what to do.

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:47.928
[DIAMANTE] Stop, you're
making me sound like

00:20:47.962 --> 00:20:49.063
some kind of genius!

00:20:49.096 --> 00:20:52.738
Yes. I can only entrust
this to a genius like you.

00:20:52.771 --> 00:20:54.641
[DIAMANTE]
No, no, I'm nothing of the sort.

00:20:54.675 --> 00:20:56.679
[DOFLAMINGO]
Fine then. You're not.

00:20:56.712 --> 00:21:00.554
All right, fine, I'm a genius,
guilty as charged!

00:21:00.587 --> 00:21:03.927
A genius that will dispose
of that fool Straw Hat,

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.365
but you didn't hear me
say it, okay?

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:08.970
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:21:09.003 --> 00:21:10.840
[DOFLAMINGO]
Don't worry, genius.

00:21:10.874 --> 00:21:13.813
He won't be able
to resist this one.

00:21:24.334 --> 00:21:26.773
[DOFLAMINGO] The source of
his late brother's power.

00:21:26.806 --> 00:21:29.110
The Flame Flame Fruit.

00:21:34.889 --> 00:21:36.692
[DOFLAMINGO]

00:21:36.725 --> 00:21:38.730
get their hands on this thing.

00:21:38.763 --> 00:21:45.242
[DOFLAMINGO laughing]

00:22:03.613 --> 00:22:05.316

Hey, would you keep it down?
Doflamingo's gonna hear you!

00:22:53.312 --> 00:22:54.281
Not likely.

00:22:54.314 --> 00:22:58.690

00:23:16.759 --> 00:23:18.963
