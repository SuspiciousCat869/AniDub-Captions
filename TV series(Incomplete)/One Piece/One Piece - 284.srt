1
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,491
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,828
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:44,665
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:49,636
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,406
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,507
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,744
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:59,346
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,583
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,819
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,222
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:15,129
20 years ago, everything
was taken away from me.

13
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,531
And many innocent
lives were lost.

14
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:22,636
With one push of a button,
they summoned a terrible demon.

15
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,805
Now it rears its head again.

16
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:29,243
Aiming its sights on the friends
I've searched so hard to find.

17
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,512
The more that I wish
for us to be together,

18
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:36,317
the more my ugly fate
bares its fangs at you!

19
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,320
Even now, no matter
how far we sail,

20
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:42,690
there's an enemy that
haunts me at every turn!

21
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:47,094
Because I'm facing the world,
and all of its darkness.

22
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,331
First it was Aokiji,
and now CP9.

23
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,334
I've dragged you into
my troubles twice already!

24
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:57,404
If it goes on and on like
this, no matter how kind

25
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:02,343
you may be, someday,
you'll see me as a burden.

26
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:05,479
Someday you'll be forced to
betray me and throw me away!

27
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,415
That's what I'm most
afraid of! Understand?

28
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,584
That's why I didn't
want you to rescue me!

29
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,720
If that's the
only future I have,

30
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,722
I'd rather die
to save me the pain!

31
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:22,663
There you have it!

32
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,065
Yep! Right on the mark!

33
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,133
What a sorry case!

34
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,301
Even if you make friends,

35
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,136
all you can do is drag them
through the mud with you!

36
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:35,508
You can't win, pirates.
Look at this flag!

37
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:41,482
This symbol represents the
unity of over 170 nations.

38
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:45,319
A power that spans the
four seas and the Grand Line!

39
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,588
This is the world itself!

40
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,423
No matter how loud
your bark may be,

41
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,726
you can't stand up to an enemy
like that! Just face it already!

42
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,729
Do you realize how
strong our organization is?

43
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,499
Do you realize how devoted
we are to capturing her?

44
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,307
If that's Robin's enemy,
then I know what to do.

45
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,109
Sniper King.

46
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,644
Hm?

47
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,514
Shoot down that flag.

48
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,148
Roger.

49
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,788
This my new weapon, a massive
slingshot by the name of Kabuto!

50
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,257
Behold its awesome power!

51
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,593
Special Attack Firebird Star!

52
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,703
No way!

53
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,441
Mission complete.

54
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,447
Now they've done it!

55
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,548
Those idiots!

56
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,650
You can't fire on a
government flag! That's crazy!

57
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,256
Those pirates just declared war
against the World Government!

58
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,025
You're all going to die!

59
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:02,162
You morons can't challenge the
entire world and expect to win!

60
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:07,367
Yeah? Bring it on!

61
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:17,277
Robin! There's still something
I want to hear you say!

62
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:25,051
Tell me you want to live!

63
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,055
Robin.

64
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:34,661
Robin.

65
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,432
I can live?

66
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,403
I never dared to wish
for something like that.

67
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,608
The world had
denied me that hope.

68
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,713
The sea's a vast
place so I guarantee.

69
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,249
Someday you'll find friends
who won't ever leave you!

70
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,694
Believe in Luffy.

71
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,465
But now.

72
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:18,371
If I'm allowed to say my wish,
just this once. Then I--

73
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,643
I want to live!

74
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:26,413
Take me with you!
Take me away from here!

75
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:55,208
You guys! You're
so awesome! I love you!

76
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,744
Let's go!

77
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,719
"I'm Not Gonna Hand
over the Blueprints!

78
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,621
Franky's Decision."

79
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,192
All right!

80
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,427
We pulled the lever!

81
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,030
Bring down the bridge!

82
00:08:57,437 --> 00:09:01,208
Looks like Mozu took care
of things on her side, too.

83
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:03,143
Go, Straw Hat!

84
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,516
Look! The drawbridge
is lowering!

85
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,419
Our reinforcements pulled
it together after all.

86
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,554
And just in time, too.

87
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,529
I'm trembling with excitement!

88
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,532
Come on, hurry up!

89
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,768
Lookin' scary there, Zoro.

90
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:35,475
Hey, Robin! We'll save you!
No matter what!

91
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,178
Stay away!

92
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,080
They're in high spirits!

93
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,584
They've sure got guts
burning down our flag.

94
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,718
They're just idiots.

95
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:48,555
They dug their graves the
second they set foot here.

96
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,191
No, stay over there!

97
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:55,696
That got it! Go, Straw Hat!
The rest is up to you!

98
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,299
Damn you, pirate scum!

99
00:09:58,332 --> 00:09:59,733
We'll never let you though!

100
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,469
Prepare the mortar cannon!

101
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:06,106
Don't let them cross the bridge,
even if you have to destroy it!

102
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,508
Yes, sir!

103
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,777
No way I'm gonna
let you do that!

104
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,146
Pipe Hitch Knives!

105
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:17,017
You've got three heads
too many! Dismantler Chop!

106
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,112
Chief Justice Baskerville, no!

107
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:51,085
Psych! Joke's on you!

108
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,253
We're actually the
Chief Justice Trio!

109
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,825
Known as the Left Baskerville,
my true name is Bas!

110
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:01,428
Known as the Right Baskerville,
my name is Kerville!

111
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:06,100
And as for me, the Center
Baskerville. Call me Princess!

112
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,501
What is wrong with you?

113
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:10,671
You mean all this time it
was three dudes stuck together?

114
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,373
Why would they do that?

115
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,008
'Cause we're the
best of friends!

116
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:17,544
That's just weird!

117
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,480
Now, fire the trench mortar!

118
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,147
Fire!

119
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,326
What happened? Why'd it stop?

120
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,162
Damn those marines!
They really piss me off!

121
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,264
Stop getting in the way!

122
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:45,138
We got it, Chief Spandam!
Evacuate the Tower of Law!

123
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,715
Good work. And also good advice!

124
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:58,285
This should buy me enough time
to get to the Gates of Justice.

125
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,454
All right, move it!

126
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:03,190
Someone grab Cutty Flam
and bring him too!

127
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,124
Robin!

128
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:09,162
They're nobodies.
Just a bunch of scum.

129
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:13,600
As long as I've got CP9 here,
I'm practically invincible!

130
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,037
Better yet, I've also
got the only person

131
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,574
who can revive the
ancient weapons, Nico Robin.

132
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,641
Not to mention the man

133
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:25,713
who inherited one of their
blueprints, Cutty Flam.

134
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,182
I'm not letting this
slip through my fingers!

135
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,717
I'll crush as many
pirates as it takes!

136
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,524
What? What the hell is it?

137
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,438
Is that-- No-- It can't be.

138
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,678
Those aren't the real
blueprints for Pluton.

139
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:01,348
Oh, they're real.
Don't believe me?

140
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:07,787
Lucci, Kaku, you
guys can tell, right?

141
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,534
Suppose we should've
seen this coming.

142
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,703
If you can hide soda
and weapons in your body,

143
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:25,539
you can hide blueprints
just as easily.

144
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:32,779
So, they are real?
They're really real?

145
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:36,417
That's great!
Then hand them over!

146
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,786
Saves me the trouble
of searching for them!

147
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,554
Nico Robin.

148
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,824
I gotta admit,
the rumors I heard about

149
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,827
you were about as
wrong as they could be.

150
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,397
While the government was
dragging us to this crap hole,

151
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,199
I realized that you aren't
the monster that's gonna

152
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:55,068
use the ancient
technology for evil.

153
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:02,176
I know the shipwrights from
Water 7 have been passing down

154
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,546
these blueprints from
generation to generation,

155
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,816
but we're not doing
it to revive a weapon.

156
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:12,419
Tom had achieved so
many wonderful things.

157
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,754
But he gave up everything

158
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:16,490
to keep these blueprints
hidden from the world.

159
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,525
As long as the risk
remains that a woman

160
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:21,662
named Nico Robin can figure out
how to restore the weapon,

161
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,497
then the world
needs these blueprints

162
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,799
to be able to fight back!

163
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,236
Hey, Spanda.

164
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,338
The reason why Tom and
Iceberg risked their lives

165
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,240
to protect this is simple.

166
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,508
Just give me the blueprints!

167
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,343
If an ancient weapon
fell into the hands

168
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,646
of some power-hungry
dumbass like you,

169
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,781
who knows what might happen.

170
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,783
In other words,
the shipwrights passed

171
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:45,686
this blueprint down to create
a possible countermeasure

172
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,322
against another weapon.

173
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,191
Now I agree that
Robin's a dangerous woman.

174
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,360
As long as people
like you are around,

175
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,397
even if she has the best
intentions, her knowledge

176
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,100
could still be used to wreak
havoc on the whole world.

177
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,069
But now she's got
friends who are willing

178
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:05,573
to risk their lives to
make sure that never happens.

179
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:10,610
And I think they're up to
the job. So I'm making a bet.

180
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,147
Now that everything's
gone to hell,

181
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,449
I have to get a little
creative if I'm gonna uphold

182
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,585
the wishes of the
original architects.

183
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:20,154
Just shut up and hand
them over already!

184
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:22,556
Those blueprints are mine!

185
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:29,429
Tom, if you were here, I'm
sure you'd do the same thing.

186
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,592
Now that everything's
gone to hell,

187
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,828
I have to get a little
creative if I'm gonna uphold

188
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:03,163
the wishes of the
original architects.

189
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,699
Just shut up and
hand them over already!

190
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,767
Those blueprints are mine!

191
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,505
Tom, if you were here,

192
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:14,040
I'm sure you'd
do the same thing.

193
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:37,464
What the hell are you doing? No!

194
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,370
My dream! It's
been burnt to a crisp!

195
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:46,640
We spent five years
on our mission for this?

196
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,349
The only reason we were keeping

197
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,551
those blueprints was to
create a countermeasure.

198
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:02,056
So if you took 'em away,
that would defeat the purpose.

199
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:05,392
Now that it's come to this,
destroying 'em is all I can do.

200
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,596
But I'd rather sacrifice my own
plan than help you with yours.

201
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:11,198
If you end up making
a weapon after all,

202
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,367
we won't be able to
fight back anymore,

203
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,434
and that's possible
if you're able

204
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:17,571
to take Nico Robin through
the Gates of Justice.

205
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,406
Everything's resting
on the Straw Hats,

206
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,610
and if they're able
to get her outta here,

207
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:25,212
then you'll be left
with nothing at all.

208
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:28,682
I've placed my bet.
I think they can do it.

209
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:31,819
You've made a mockery
of me for the last time.

210
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:33,387
Laugh it up while you can,

211
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,323
because you're not
leaving this island alive!

212
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,226
Big Bro!

213
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,666
Hey! Look! We're all
down here, Big Bro!

214
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,534
Look guys! Big Bro's
right over there!

215
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,370
That means we're not too late!

216
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,405
Oh! You're right, I can see him!

217
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,275
Don't worry, we'll
save you no matter what!

218
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:58,045
We came with the Straw Hats!

219
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,581
Sodom and Gomorrah
fought hard, too!

220
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:04,284
We're all going home
together! I promise!

221
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,620
They didn't hurt you, did they?

222
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:12,259
What? No way!
Aw, damn it you guys.

223
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,628
I didn't ask you save me.

224
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:18,498
I didn't ask you
but you still came!

225
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,804
I'm not crying!

226
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:27,507
You hear me, you bastards?
I'm not crying!

227
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:38,719
Shut up! That's enough!

228
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:39,453
Whoa, Luffy!

229
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:40,587
Calm down!

230
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,557
Robin's waiting! Hurry up
and bring down the bridge!

231
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,392
Oh yeah, right.

232
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,161
What the hell are
you waiting for?

233
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,597
No kidding! Get moving already!

234
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,231
Don't make me come down there!

235
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,666
Uh, yes ma'am.

236
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:57,304
Wow Nami, you're sexy
when you boss people around!

237
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,672
Hey, Straw Hat!

238
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:01,875
Thanks for helping out my men

239
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:06,213
while I was gone, but now
that the gang's all here.

240
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,482
The one and only
Franky will show you

241
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,218
how super his gratitude can be!

242
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,653
I don't need your help!

243
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,122
I'm still mad about
what you did to Usopp,

244
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,457
so don't think we're friends!

245
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,527
He's, uh, right
next to you, ain't he?

246
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:27,434
Cutty Flam, how dare
you burn my blueprints!

247
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,203
I'm gonna make you pay!

248
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:43,284
Bro!

249
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:46,386
Big Bro's falling
down the waterfall!

250
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:49,356
Franky!

251
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:50,758
Hey! Straw Hats!

252
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,559
Huh? Granny Kokoro?

253
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,729
I heard everything. Why are
you all just standing around?

254
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,131
We're not "standing around"!

255
00:19:57,164 --> 00:19:58,732
The bridge broke--there's
no way over!

256
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,668
It's halfway down, isn't it?

257
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:01,669
That's more than enough!

258
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:05,038
Hang on - I'll be there
in about four seconds!

259
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:10,678
Jump into the waterfall! Give
it all you've got! Trust me!

260
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,246
Oi, look! Here it comes!

261
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:17,084
Monster Granny?
What did she say?

262
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:20,253
Well she said "Jump
into the waterfall".

263
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,562
Holy crap! Is that a train?

264
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,564
What's it doing
inside the courthouse?

265
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:34,768
Chimney! Sound that
whistle as loud as you can!

266
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,403
Okay!

267
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,542
Look, it's the sea train!

268
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:45,512
Hey. What's up with
that devious chuckle?

269
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,782
Chief Justice!
Get out of the way!

270
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:53,086
Don't you dare!

271
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:05,665
Let's go!

272
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:18,412
Rocketman's as fast as
the day it was made!

273
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,381
I'm gonna show you
why Tom's Workers is

274
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:24,284
the most legendary ship-building
company in the world!

275
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:29,756
Is that Rocketman?

276
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,631
It's flying!

277
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,615
Please, go away!

278
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,389
Waterfall!

279
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,229
Brings back memories,
don't it, Tom?

280
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:15,369
Giving a hand to that Roger guy
is something I'll never forget.

281
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:19,240
In fact, it's something
I take great pride in!

282
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:21,709
My name's Luffy and I'm gonna
be King of the Pirates.

283
00:22:21,742 --> 00:22:22,476
Really?

284
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,577
Yep.

285
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,314
That boy may have a screw loose,

286
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:30,451
but come to think
of it, so did Roger.

287
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:34,388
It's funny, all those years
ago you helped him out,

288
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:36,657
and now Tom's Workers
is coming together again

289
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,627
to help out this Straw Hat Boy.

290
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,495
We sure didn't learn
our lesson, did we?

291
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:48,668
But I gotta feeling you woulda
done the same thing, Tom.

292
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,246
We're gonna crash!

293
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,182
Hey! What the hell are we doing?

294
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:15,596
We've come a long way,
but Robin's still in trouble.

295
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:16,697
We'd better do something

296
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,766
before they take her
through the Gates of Justice.

297
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,367
Guess there's no way around it.

298
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,303
We're gonna have
to take out CP9.

299
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:24,505
We don't have much time,
so we'd better split up!

300
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:27,141
Everyone, you gotta win,
even if it kills you!

301
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:29,543
On the next One Piece:

302
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,378
"Obtain the Five Keys!

303
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:34,148
The Straw Hat Pirates vs. CP9."

304
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,116
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
