1
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,889
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,592
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,227
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,230
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,731
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,568
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,203
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:52,105
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,042
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,610
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,211
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:01,648
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:05,085
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:08,088
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:11,491
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:16,296
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,571
[NARRATOR] Separated
from the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,407
Luffy launched a desperate
attack on Navy Headquarters,

19
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,311
in hopes of saving his
brother from execution.

20
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,646
However, his struggle
ended in vain,

21
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,616
with his enemies claiming
an overwhelming victory,

22
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,651
along with Ace's life.

23
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,287
But this is a story
from another time.

24
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,124
Ten years ago, in a
corner of the East Blue,

25
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:46,159
near Windmill Village.

26
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,628
[GARP]
Luffy, this here is Ace.

27
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,965
Anyway, you 're gonna be living
with him and Dadan from now on.

28
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,034
I know I was gone for a while,

29
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,469
but I still wanna be friends!

30
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,025
[LUFFY]
It's the end of the forest.

31
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,498
[LUFFY]
"Here Comes Sabo!

32
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,600
The Boy at the Gray Terminal!"

33
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,843
I can't believe we
scored this much cash!

34
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,344
I told you, didn't I?

35
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:38,846
Porchemy knows what's up.

36
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,014
Just tell him our treasure's
from the Grand Line

37
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,384
and that greedy merchant
can't help himself.

38
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:46,553
He was practically
begging us for it!

39
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,355
If the dumbass wants
to buy a bunch of trash

40
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,691
we picked up on the shore,
I'm not gonna stop him.

41
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,526
Well, not like he's
ever going to sea,

42
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,462
so it's all the same to him.

43
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,432
Not like we've ever been
to sea either, though.

44
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:13,213
Huh?

45
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,215
What is this place?

46
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,051
[NARRATOR] On the North
side of Mount Corvo,

47
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,887
not far from where
Dadan's bandits live,

48
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,590
there is a surprise
at the end of the forest.

49
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:23,824
Covered in a thick mist,

50
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:27,962
piles of trash reach
toward the heavens.

51
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,464
It is a place where
the unwanted gather.

52
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,069
That goes for the refuse as well
as those who reside there,

53
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,738
rogues cast out by society.

54
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,907
It is a den of lawlessness.

55
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,076
Crime and disease run rampant,

56
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:45,246
with neither Marines
nor doctors present.

57
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,349
This place is known
as "Gray Terminal."

58
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,887
Hey, Ace!

59
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,325
What the--?

60
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,993
Whoa.

61
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,041
Wonder where he went?

62
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,149
Ace!

63
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:25,519
Stop trying to hide from me!

64
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,888
Come on!

65
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,026
Where are you?

66
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,970
Wow, I can't believe
I slept all day again.

67
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,339
[yawns]

68
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,074
Just a bunch of junk.

69
00:06:47,108 --> 00:06:48,509
Gotta be something.

70
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,377
Come on.

71
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:53,080
Ha!

72
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,515
Finally!

73
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:55,382
[MAN C]
Fork it over!

74
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,683
[MAN D]
Yeah, right! That's mine!

75
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:57,551
[MAN B]
Screw you!

76
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,386
I found it!

77
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,255
You're gonna break it,
you idiots!

78
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,557
[MAN E] It's cool man,
I just wanna cash it in for you!

79
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,258
[MAN B]
Yeah, right!

80
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,394
[MAN C]
C'mon, just gimme one pearl!

81
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,064
[gasps]

82
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,437
Back off!

83
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:21,074
You can only blame yourself.

84
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,378
Next time, let's try this
without all the running.

85
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:25,045
Huh?

86
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,047
Look what I found!

87
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,048
No way!

88
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,584
Get back here!

89
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,920
[MAN C]
Thief!

90
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:39,493
Hey!

91
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,194
Move it, you brat!

92
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,964
What is your problem?

93
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,933
You want some of this?

94
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,467
[MAN C]
He went that way!

95
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,935
Huh?

96
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,808
Sabo!

97
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,776
Hey, are you up there?

98
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,445
[SABO grunts]

99
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,148
Oh. What's up, Ace?

100
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,816
[ACE] Sorry I'm
a little late this time.

101
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,652
[SABO] More than "a little."
I went out there.

102
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,221
and made a
killing already today.

103
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,556
Heh.

104
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,557
[ACE]
Heh.

105
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,658
Oh yeah?

106
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,393
Well, maybe I did too.

107
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:48,329
[SABO, ACE]
Let's see!

108
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,864
Whoa! Dude!

109
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,499
You got more than me!

110
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,533
That's a ton of cash!

111
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,968
What happened?

112
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,804
Some chumps near the gate.

113
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,839
Robbed 'em blind
and made a run for it.

114
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,474
Hah! Well, crap!

115
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,276
Guess you win again, buddy!

116
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,578
It doesn't matter
if you "win" or "lose."

117
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:08,014
We've got five years of
"pirate savings" piled up.

118
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,051
We should both
be happy about that.

119
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,123
We worked pretty hard.

120
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,793
Yeah, no kidding.

121
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:19,960
We'll leave this dump behind

122
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:23,463
and go places these
chumps never even dreamed of.

123
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,299
This is all gonna be worth it.

124
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,900
Just you wait.

125
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,541
We'd better put it away now.

126
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,477
We can't let
anyone else see this.

127
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,212
So how much is a ship?

128
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,981
I want a good one, but
seems like we're pretty rich.

129
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:41,915
Yeah?

130
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,718
Could take 10 million,
maybe even more.

131
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,186
Shouldn't rush it.

132
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,657
[LUFFY] Did you say "ship"?
You're gonna be pirates?

133
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,226
And you've got
hidden treasure already?

134
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,529
I'm gonna be a pirate too! Yay!

135
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,733
[giggles]

136
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:07,874
[SABO, ACE growl]
Shut up!

137
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,712
Know what's cool?

138
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,848
Now that I know where you go,
I can follow you every day!

139
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:15,883
[ACE]
Great.

140
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,518
Luffy, huh?

141
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,587
This is the brat you
were talking about.

142
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,688
Huh?!

143
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,355
Does that mean you
told your friends about me?

144
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,092
I was telling my friend
how annoying you were.

145
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,129
[SABO] He also told me that
your head's full of rocks.

146
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:30,564
[laughs]
Head rocks!

147
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:33,567
You do realize we're messing
with you here, right?

148
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:36,203
The route I took here
wasn't easy to follow.

149
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,373
I knew he was hard-headed, but
I didn't think he was so tough.

150
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,875
So great that Ace
has other friends too!

151
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,877
I bet we're all
gonna be best pals!

152
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,245
[SABO] I'm not your "pal."

153
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,415
You don't even know
my name, stupid!

154
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:48,082
'Kay.

155
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,383
Then what is your name?

156
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:50,384
[SABO]
It's Sa...

157
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,886
...a secret!

158
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,421
I told you, didn't I?

159
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:54,955
You need to live here!

160
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,990
The mountains made you tough,
but at this rate,

161
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,759
our whole plan's
gonna be ruined.

162
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,629
What now?

163
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,432
[ACE]
He knows our secret.

164
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:07,000
We can't trust him
to keep his mouth shut.

165
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,603
He's too stupid.

166
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,275
We'll kill him.

167
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:16,243
Yep.

168
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,244
Sounds good.

169
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,246
[gasps]

170
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,115
No!

171
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,285
Stop, this is scary!

172
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:26,353
Somebody help me!

173
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,121
I don't wanna die!

174
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,857
[SABO] Gimme a break!
This kid is the worst!

175
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,125
Just kill 'im already!

176
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,126
Hurry it up!

177
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,161
He's your problem--
why don't you do it?

178
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,497
Because I've never killed
anyone before, okay?

179
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,831
Well, neither have I!

180
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,366
I don't know how
this crap works!

181
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,469
Just don't throw me in
the water, I'm begging you!

182
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:43,804
[ACE]
Okay! The river!

183
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:46,273
[SABO] That's convenient,
but why did he say that?

184
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:47,341
[ACE]
I told you, he's stupid!

185
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,843
Somebody help me!

186
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,378
[SABO, ACE]
That's enough!

187
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,682
Don't kill me!!

188
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,051
[HOODLUM A]
Wait listen.

189
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,318
I just heard some screaming.

190
00:11:58,352 --> 00:11:59,553
Sounded like a kid.

191
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:00,520
Aw, damn it.

192
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,055
Somebody heard him!

193
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:02,923
Set him free.

194
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,391
We gotta get
outta here and fast.

195
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:05,525
If people start snooping around,

196
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,727
they'll find our treasure.

197
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,731
Sounds like you're talking
about Ace and Sabo--

198
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,401
those two're
infamous around here.

199
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,370
And the one who took your money.

200
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:17,671
That was Ace, right?

201
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,340
The kid who had the
black hair, you said?

202
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:20,340
Uh-huh.

203
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,042
This is real pathetic, I know.

204
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:23,510
We both got sloppy.

205
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,679
He's either cocky or dumb.

206
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:29,016
You can't rob pirates blind
and expect to get away with it.

207
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,051
Bottom line is, if we
don't get that money back,

208
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:35,088
Captain Bluejam's gonna skin
us alive, and I mean literally.

209
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:37,525
[ACE]
Bluejam?

210
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:38,759
Crap!

211
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,928
How was I s'posed to know
they were workin' with him?

212
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,363
You robbed those guys?

213
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,397
Are you trying to
get us killed or what?

214
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,299
[ACE]
Yeah.

215
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,901
This is not gonna end well.

216
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,202
[SABO]
That sword looks sharp.

217
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,238
though you probably
saw that already.

218
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,375
The guy with 'em is Porchemy.

219
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,210
He's crazy.

220
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,945
Lose a fight with him.

221
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:01,248
And he'll scalp you alive
just to hear you scream.

222
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,454
Just lay low and
let 'em pass by for now.

223
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:09,556
Uh-oh.

224
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,924
He's gone.

225
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:14,828
You better put me down
right now, you big jerk!

226
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,130
[SABO, ACE]
How did he get caught already?

227
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,165
Oh, you wanna play tough huh?

228
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,200
Don't say I didn't warn you!

229
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,738
Who the hell is this?

230
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,972
This guy won't put me down!

231
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,942
Ace, help!

232
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,578
Ace! Why aren't you saving me?

233
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:31,278
We're friends, right?

234
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,946
We should've killed him.

235
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,781
Now we're all dead!

236
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:55,268
So, you know Ace, do ya?

237
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,436
Yeah, that's right.

238
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,106
And if you cry, do ya
think he'll come for ya?

239
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,310
Yeah, 'cause we're friends.

240
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:07,348
Except he just tried
to kill me, so maybe not.

241
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:08,181
Shut up!

242
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,618
Are you kidding me?

243
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,686
[PORCHEMY] If he's your friend,
maybe you can help us.

244
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,621
See, Ace stole our money.

245
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:18,125
And if we got it back, we
wouldn't have to hurt anybody.

246
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:21,228
You don't happen to
know where it is, do ya?

247
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:26,867
[SABO]
We're screwed!

248
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,136
They're gonna take
our treasure for sure!

249
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,437
For once in your life,

250
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,806
please shut up.

251
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:39,813
Well?

252
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:42,048
Are ya gonna talk?

253
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,156
I don't know!

254
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,025
Sorry.

255
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,059
[PORCHEMY]
What a crappy liar!

256
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,931
[chuckles]

257
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,202
All right, fine.

258
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:05,038
I'm sure you just forgot.

259
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,008
[chuckles]

260
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:11,711
Don't worry, I have ways
of jogging your memory.

261
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,181
[LUFFY]
I told you I don't know!

262
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,350
Let go of me, you dumb jerk!

263
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,518
Ace is gonna kick your butt,
I'm telling you!

264
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:23,524
You're in big trouble, buddy.
You're gonna be sorry, damn it!

265
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:25,025
'Kay, so now what?

266
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,526
Stop asking me!

267
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,128
You know what!

268
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:38,038
Lemme go!

269
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,740
I'm not telling
you a darn thing!

270
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,150
You little punk!

271
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,825
[shocked noises]

272
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,932
The Gum-Gum Fruit
turned me into rubber,

273
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,235
so that stuff's not
gonna work on me!

274
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:10,937
Calm down!

275
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,073
A Devil Fruit, huh?

276
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:14,608
Heh.

277
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,110
I know how to deal with that.

278
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,582
Bring me my pair of gloves.

279
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,417
[HOODLUM B]
Y-Yes, sir!

280
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,085
[SABO]
Hurry, man!

281
00:16:24,118 --> 00:16:25,119
Faster!

282
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,787
We're screwed
if those guys come back!

283
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:29,990
We gotta move all this,
but I don't know where.

284
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,191
Luffy's pretty stubborn,

285
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,961
but it's only a matter of time
before he rats us out.

286
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,996
I'm not losing our pirate
savings to those jerks,

287
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,298
or anyone else!

288
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,300
It took us five years
to score all this!

289
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,801
We can't get stuck
in this dump forever!

290
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:48,675
I'll try to clear
this up a little.

291
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,278
The money Ace stole isn't
just some chump change,

292
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,646
it's a matter of life
and death for me

293
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,714
and all of my buddies here.

294
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:57,851
And you're gonna
tell me where it is.

295
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:01,721
Even if I gotta
beat it outta you.

296
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,456
Will not!

297
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,866
That's rough!

298
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,639
I'm warnin' you, kid.
You don't piss off a pirate.

299
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:21,041
If I don't kick your ass,

300
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:24,878
Captain Bluejam's gonna
kill you and all of us, too.

301
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,219
[LUFFY screams]
Let me go!

302
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,354
You're hurting me!

303
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,089
Somebody help!

304
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,028
[PORCHEMY] We don't have time
to stand around, you idiots!

305
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:44,031
Go look for Ace and Sabo while
I take care of this one!

306
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,565
[HOODLUMS
Yes, sir!

307
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,109
[MAN H]
Ace and Sabo, huh?

308
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:56,577
Yeah. I know 'em.

309
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,545
Oh, I get it.

310
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,213
You're from the city.

311
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,948
Leave those two be.

312
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,118
If you were locals,
you'd understand.

313
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,619
They may be kids,
but they're also crazy.

314
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:09,890
Yeah, man, they got claws
like a tiger, if you cross 'em.

315
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,558
Ace and Sabo, huh?

316
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,560
I wouldn't know.

317
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,896
But while we're
having this little chat.

318
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,632
Why don't you boys
fork over your wallets?

319
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,601
We... We don't want any trouble!

320
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:22,502
We'll ask someone else!

321
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:24,571
What's going on?

322
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,606
If they're asking around,

323
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:27,908
they still don't know
about our treasure.

324
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,777
Surely Luffy would've
told them by now.

325
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:33,446
No way!

326
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:38,418
[ACE] Didn't realize
it was getting so late.

327
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:39,119
All right!

328
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,620
I finally did it!

329
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:43,156
Not even Luffy knows
about this spot!

330
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,464
[ACE]
Damn it.

331
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:51,998
Just forget about him.

332
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,803
I'm back!

333
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:57,771
[ACE]
Hmm?

334
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:58,972
I moved everything.

335
00:18:59,005 --> 00:18:59,907
What happened?

336
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,975
Are they poking
around at the old place?

337
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,446
No, that's the thing.

338
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,450
Bluejam's guys are
still out looking for us!

339
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,651
And what does that mean?

340
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:13,320
I'm telling you, it's Luffy!

341
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:16,924
All that time and
he still didn't rat us out!

342
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:20,227
I thought he would,
since he's such an idiot.

343
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:22,830
That, and he was crying
whenever we left him.

344
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:24,832
But you know what
this means, don't you?

345
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:26,867
They're torturing him right now!

346
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,704
What if he still doesn't talk?

347
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,015
[BLUEJAM]
Getting awful late, isn't it?

348
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:45,185
Who did I leave in charge today?

349
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:49,089
Well, Captain Bluejam, if I
recall, it should be Porchemy.

350
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:52,058
Huh. Then he'd better hurry.

351
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:56,363
Well, surely they made the sale.

352
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:59,200
It couldn't have
taken them that long.

353
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:01,568
Maybe Porchemy
thinks he's clever enough

354
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,671
to take my money and skip town.

355
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,339
Of course not, Captain!

356
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:09,210
I doubt he would throw his life
away for some measly treasure.

357
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:10,711
Ah...

358
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:12,713
Let's hope not.

359
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:17,250
[punching sounds]

360
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,923
[PORCHEMY]
C'mon, kid, spit it out.

361
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:27,728
W-Wait.

362
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:29,096
Porchemy, stop it.

363
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:31,097
I don't think he's gonna talk.

364
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:35,602
He's shutting down.

365
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:38,505
The kid's not even
calling for help anymore.

366
00:20:42,443 --> 00:20:44,778
If he was gonna talk,
he would've done it already.

367
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,914
And to be honest, this is
getting kinda hard to watch.

368
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:50,450
Show the little
bastard some mercy!

369
00:20:53,454 --> 00:20:55,288
If you have time
to bitch about this,

370
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,591
then you have time
to go look for Ace!

371
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:01,761
We're the ones who're gonna get
killed here, not the damn kid!

372
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,698
Save your breath, 'cause
you'll be begging for mercy

373
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:07,634
from Captain Bluejam
soon enough!

374
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,607
They're gonna kill that child.

375
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,443
Do you think we should call
the sheriff from the city?

376
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:17,711
There's no point.

377
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:20,347
I mean, this place doesn't
fall under any country's laws.

378
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,118
Plus, that Porchemy guy's a
member of the Bluejam Pirates.

379
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:26,153
They're paying off
the nobles, you know.

380
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:30,157
So, in other words, even if they
do get arrested for a crime,

381
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,058
they're just gonna be
pardoned in the end.

382
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:35,829
Besides, what's one more dead
body in a place like this?

383
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:37,530
Nobody gives a damn.

384
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:40,367
Answer me!

385
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,904
I'm not talking.

386
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:45,739
[PORCHEMY]
You little punk!

387
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:48,675
I'll beat that secret out
of you, or I'll beat you dead!

388
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:55,048
Tell me!

389
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:00,187
I won't do it.

390
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,222
I won't talk.

391
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:04,624
Just let me go.

392
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:10,564
[LUFFY]
I'm not telling you.

393
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:20,340
Fine.

394
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,108
Enough of this.

395
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:42,329
We're finished here, brat.

396
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:05,986
Let him go!

397
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:15,562
[NARRATOR] Ace and Sabo
storm Porchemy's hideout

398
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:18,065
to rescue Luffy
from his captors.

399
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:19,900
Outnumbered and overpowered,

400
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:22,402
the two boys show
incredible strength,

401
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,237
but when Sabo prepares to flee,

402
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:28,575
Ace makes an unexpected decision
that could spell their demise.

403
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:30,077
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

404
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,981
"I Won't Run! Ace's
Desperate Rescue Operation!"

405
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:36,616
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
