00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,449
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:40,218
A countless array of
pirates go to battle

39
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:42,520
across the seas in search
of the One Piece,

40
00:02:42,554 --> 00:02:44,522
the legendary
treasure left behind

41
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:47,258
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

42
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,161
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:51,496
after eating the
Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:54,666
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:57,569
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles

46
00:02:57,602 --> 00:02:59,204
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,237 --> 00:03:00,738
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:04,742
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:07,545
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:10,481
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:14,052
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:15,553
the crew will
cut a path across

53
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:19,090
the Grand Line
to the New World!

54
00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:23,595
[NARRATOR] After being
separated from his crew,

55
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:26,631
Luffy set out to rescue his
brother Ace from the Navy.

56
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,200
To do so, he snuck
into Impel Down,

57
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:31,536
the greatest prison
in the world.

58
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:34,806
With the assistance of Ivankov,
the queen of New Kama Land,

59
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,175
Luffy made it all
the way to level 6

60
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,377
where Ace was being detained.

61
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,046
[MAGELLAN] Impel Down
hereby transfers custody of

62
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,383
the criminal Portgas D. Ace, to
the Navy forces present today.

63
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,318
[NARRATOR]
But Luffy was too late!

64
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,456
Ace was already on a ship headed
toward Navy Headquarters.

65
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,492
[LUFFY]
I'm going to Marineford.

66
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,395
[NARRATOR] After releasing
Jimbei and Luffy's former enemy,

Crocodile, from their cells,

68
00:03:59,163 --> 00:04:01,799
Luffy's mob prepares
to storm Level 4.

69
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:07,472
[LUFFY] "Even More Chaos!
Blackbeard Teach Invades!"

70
00:04:11,342 --> 00:04:14,312
[BLUGORIS chanting]

71
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:15,747
Come on! Hurry up!

72
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,516
[MR. 3 gasps] There's a
lot of commotion out there.

[GUARD A] All prison staff.
Head to Level 4 now.

76
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,125
Repeat. All prison
staff to Level 4.

77
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,395
[MR. 3] They just made
an announcement,

78
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:32,397
but I couldn't hear it.

79
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,466
Perhaps something big is
happening downstairs.

80
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,768
Hey! Take a look, Buggy!

81
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:38,036
Huh?

82
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,638
[MR. 3] All the jailers and the

All prison staff.

00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,107
Head down to Level 4, now.

85
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:46,711
Whoa! It looks like they're
clearin' out all of the beasts!

86
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,280
[PRISONER A] Get the hell
outta here, you filthy monsters!

87
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:51,749
[PRISONER B] Yeah,
and don't ever come back!

88
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:53,451
[BUGGY]
Something big must be happenin'

89
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:55,253
on one of the other levels.

90
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:57,288
Now's our chance to make
a break for it, partner!

91
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:59,490
[MR. 3]
It's like a dream come true.

92

[whimpers]

93
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,660
Uhh...

94
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:04,429
[MR. 3]
We've been through so much.

95
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:07,098
Hunted by the Army
Wolves in level 5.

96
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:11,803
[BUGGY, MR. 3] Since when
do wolves dig underground?!

97
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:13,705
[MR. 3] And then we were
sickened by the lingering

98
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:16,841
noxious clouds of Magellan's
poison on level 4.

99
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:19,344

be Magellan's work!

Having to face off
against the Sphinx again!

part of the floor to
escape the wild beasts.

We've been stuck in
some cruel, cosmic joke

as nothing but comic
relief, but we made it!

All the way to level 2!

It's not as weird as it looks,

[GUARD B] I'm not talking about
your weird headdress!

on Level 2! And they
look like prisoners!

Yeah, Captain Buggy!

Uh, Come in. Level 2 here.

179
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:45,116
I don't know how,

180
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,618
but the prisoners are out of
their cells and rioting again!

They're out of control!

Oh, what is it now?

188
00:08:59,196 --> 00:09:01,999
[L4 GUARD A] We've found Ivankov
and Inazuma. Not only that,

tricked you with them! Mr. 2!

Can't break me,
I'm breakin' out!

What? A mob?

You're not gonna
believe this,

197
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,188
but the mob they've
got with them?

198
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:25,990
They're all of the
missing prisoners.

199
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,291
The inmates who've disappeared

200
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:29,360

Okay. I need to know.

206
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:45,543
Can I still be the warden?

Huh, You know that guy?

217
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:10,868
Yeah, and so do you.

218
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:23,047
[BON CLAY] Your swordsman buddy
defeated him back in Alabasta!

219
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,616
Nope, sorry, not ringing
any bells for me.

word from Impel Down.

An unprecedented
riot has broken out

259

and shut down the entire prison.

260
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:06,784
The ringleader of this revolt is
none other than Monkey D. Luffy.

while you still can.

Ace's execution is
five hours from now,

00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:05,803
so we don't exactly
have time in our favor.

an attack any moment now!

And this could be unrelated,

280
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:22,653
but we just received
word of a Navy ship...

a thorough search

of a state of emergency,

00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,033
This is feeling like a pretty
good time to take a snack break.

345
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:40,369
Are you nuts?
We need to save the prison now!

346
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:41,737
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Bud-a-bud-bud-a...

347
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,640
Oh, yeah? That's easy
enough for you to say!

348
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,074
Oh! I see!

349
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:48,043
You wanna be the
Vice Warden, huh?

350
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:50,045
[MAGELLAN] Hey, Hannyabal!
Can you hear me?

351
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:51,079
[GUARDS groan]

352
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:56,084
Uh! What? Warden Magellan?
Wait! Where are you?

353
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:58,754
[MAGELLAN] I'm on Level 2,
and I've just taken care

354
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:02,591
of these fools.
This floor is clear.

355
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:03,091
[HANNYABAL]
Huh?

356
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,394
[PRISONERS groan]

357
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:08,664
[PRISONER E]
Somebody help me!

358
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:11,466
[MAGELLAN] I've blocked off all
of the exits on Level 2.

359
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,471
If the poison hasn't stopped
them yet, it will soon enough.

360
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:17,439
[MAGELLAN grunts]

361
00:19:17,472 --> 00:19:20,475
[PRISONER F]
No! We're completely blocked in!

362
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,211
The doorway's
clogged with poison!

363
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,679
What do we do, Captain Buggy?

364
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:27,149
[BUGGY growls]
Magellan!

365
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:29,384
You obnoxious, toxic bastard!

366
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,553
Blast! He'll find
us if we stay here!

367
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,722
[MAGELLAN] As for Blackbeard,
I haven't a clue why

368
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,525
he's attacking us, but I've
already taken care of things.

369
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:37,759
[HANNYABAL]
Nice!

370
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:40,162
[MAGELLAN] It's not something
I particularly wanted to do,

371
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:42,764
but I wasn't given
any other options.

372
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:43,632
[HANNYABAL]
What do you mean

373
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:45,734
it's not something
you wanted to do?

374
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,338
Against better judgment,

375
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:51,773
I decided to release
Shiryu to deal with them.

376
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:54,710
[HANNYABAL]
Are you insane?!

377
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:59,648
Possibly, but we can't ask
Navy HQ for reinforcements.

378
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:03,352
We're left with no choice but
to deal with this ourselves.

379
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:04,586
And as for you,

380
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,123
put all of your efforts into
getting Level 4 under control.

381
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:11,126
I'll be heading down
to Level 4 soon enough.

382
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,097
Until I get there,
it's your mess to clean up.

383
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:24,606
[HANNYABAL yells]
I love you! Warden!

384
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,707
Warden!

385
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:26,842
I love the Warden!

386
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,144
Love The Warden!
Love The Warden!

387
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:31,446
Yeah, shouldn't
we be going now?

388
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,848
[HANNYABAL]
Fever.

389
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:38,453
--[IVANKOV] Hee-haw!
--[GUARDS scream]

390
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:44,326
[LUFFY yells]

391
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:57,472
[LUFFY grunts]

392
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,408
Hey, crab guy!

393
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,810
You know where the
staircase to Level 3 is?

394
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,245
It's to the left!

395
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:05,347
Directly across that bridge.

396
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:08,684
Got it, thanks!

397
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:12,154
Guards, outta my way!

398
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:23,198
[chains clink]

399
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:27,336
[door creaks]

400
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,406
[footsteps]

401
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,245
[SHIRYU]
Light.

402
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,314
[L6 GUARD A gasps]
Yes, sir!

403
00:21:49,524 --> 00:21:52,594
[MAGELLAN] Shiryu, feels
good to step out of that cell,

404
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:53,428
doesn't it?

405
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:56,631
Oh, yeah, it's nice.
Lesson learned.

406
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:59,401
All that boredom really makes
you long for the excitement

407
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:02,938
of death. But you're not gonna
use me as your pawn only to toss

408
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:06,608
my ass back in there once you're
done with me, right, Magellan?

409
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:16,184
You're a condemned prisoner,
but this is your one chance.

410
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:18,320
Consider it a deferred sentence.

411
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:21,356
Yeah, right.
Fine with me.

412
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,925
I'll make sure I'm
on my best behavior.

413
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:27,896
[L6 GUARD A] Here's your
sword, Jail Manager Shiryu.

414
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,598
[MAGELLAN]
As for Blackbeard,

415
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:31,600
he's all yours.

416
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,438
[SHIRYU]
Works for me.

417
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:38,206
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL B]
Ca-chick!

418
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,778
[SHIRYU]
Oh, my lovely sword.

419
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:48,450
It's been too long.

420
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:55,657
[L6 GUARDS gasp, whimper]

421
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,193
[L6 GUARDS groan]

422
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:04,766
[SHIRYU]
I got carried away there.

423
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,334
Sorry.

424
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:16,511
[NARRATOR] Undeterred by
the defenses of Impel Down,

425
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:19,581
the Blackbeard Pirates march
onward through the prison.

426
00:23:19,614 --> 00:23:22,484
Faced with an impossible
dilemma, Magellan is forced

427
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:25,954
to unleash a dangerous former
ally to deal with the intruders.

428
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,955
But what will happen

429
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,624
when Blackbeard crosses
paths with the killer?

430
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,426
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece,

431
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,861
"The Dangerous Encounter!

432
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:35,297
Blackbeard and
Shiryu of the Rain"

433
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,966
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
