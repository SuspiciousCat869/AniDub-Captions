1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,324
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,793
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,465
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:50,503
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,606
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,943
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,379
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,815
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,785
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:09,289
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,798
What? What? No!

48
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,634
[NAMI] Stop it! What're you
doing? Where am I? Cut it out!

49
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,373
[LOLA]
Curse you, Namizo!

50
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,714
That is enough!

51
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,482
Why don't you just
bury your rotting carcass

52
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,818
in a hole somewhere,
so I can get married already!

53
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,520
[LOLA] Run for it
while you still can!

54
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,389
I'll hold him off, but I
don't know how long I can last!

55
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,526
I came here
to save you, my friend!

56
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,528
[NAMI]
Lola!

57
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,862
[LOLA]
C'mere Master Ab!

58
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,333
Get out of my way.
Or suffer!

59
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,771
[ABSALOM] How dare you make me
waste so much strength

60
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,440
disposing of you!

61
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,543
You can't do that to Lola!

62
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,415
Swing. Arm!

63
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,518
I know this still
isn't enough to beat you,

64
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,520
but I'll be damned
if I don't try!

65
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,632
I win! Yeah!

66
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,035
[SANJI]
Hey, Oars!

67
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,103
[OARS]
Huh?

68
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:37,143
[SANJI] If that's really Luffy's
Shadow you've got inside you,

69
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,879
then I probably shouldn't
have to tell you this,

70
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,147
but you should
never underestimate

71
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,716
the strength of your own crew.

72
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,891
[LUFFY]
"Knock Him Down!

73
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,761
Special Attack:
Straw Hat Docking?"

74
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,175
There's no need
to worry about me, Nami.

75
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,443
I'm all right.

76
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,745
Trust me, there's plenty else
for you to be troubled about.

77
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,013
I guess I'd better
catch you up to speed

78
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,948
on what's been
happening on the island.

79
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,916
Please do.

80
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:17,817
Things've only gotten worse

81
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,952
since your captain's
shadow was taken.

82
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,855
Moria placed his shadow
inside a giant super zombie,

83
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,525
and now it's destroying
everything in sight.

84
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,529
[NAMI]
A giant super zombie?

85
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,765
Now! Awaken!

86
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:48,448
Meat!

87
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,784
[NAMI]
The one I saw in the freezer.

88
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,052
Please, you have to hurry.

89
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,121
You just let me
take care of Absalom.

90
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,624
Thank you, Lola,
I owe you one!

91
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,294
[LOLA]
Alright, Absalom,

92
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,730
let's finish the destruction
that zombie started!

93
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,632
We're gonna knock this
building down with our love!

94
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,571
[NAMI] How can we get Luffy's
shadow out of that monster?

95
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:12,538
Even with the whole crew,

96
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,475
we'd have to come up
with one heck of a plan.

97
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,976
But first...

98
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,911
[NAMI] There's no way
I'm going back empty handed

99
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,013
after all the crap
I've been through!

100
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,652
Yes, there it is!
The treasure chamber!

101
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,230
[NAMI]
It... It's...

102
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:40,166
Empty!

103
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,534
What the hell?

104
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,069
Where'd the treasure go?

105
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,771
There's nothing left!

106
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,074
I know this is the right room.

107
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,776
Did someone take it?

108
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,446
Whoa, check it out!

109
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,681
Isn't that the woman
we captured earlier?

110
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,850
It's her, alright!
Why's she here?

111
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:58,851
Them again?

112
00:06:58,885 --> 00:06:59,952
We better report this!

113
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,120
Report it!

114
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,089
[NAMI]
Not so fast, you rats!

115
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:07,760
Well.

116
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,028
Your timing
couldn't have been better.

117
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:13,474
I've got some questions, and I
bet you guys have some answers.

118
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,763
[OARS] You tiny pirates are
tougher than I thought you'd be.

119
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:51,854
I'm tired of being
thrown around so much.

120
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,389
What do you say
we turn the tables

121
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:55,625
and throw' him around
for a change?

122
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:56,159
[USOPP]
Huh?

123
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:57,793
Hey, come on, Zoro.

124
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,962
[SANJI]
I can get behind that.

125
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:02,498
[SANJI] We've let him have
his fun for long enough.

126
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:03,799
[USOPP]
Hey, whoa, wait a minute!

127
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,835
How're we supposed to throw him?

128
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:08,638
In case you haven't noticed,
he's a giant!

129
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:10,640
We noticed.

130
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,707
And don't forget

131
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,410
he's got Luffy's speed
and fighting skills as well.

132
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:15,411
You know,

133
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:17,813
I think he would make
a terrible pirate king.

134
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:19,982
So how do we wanna
approach this, then?

135
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:23,085
I've got a ton of plans.
One of em's gotta work.

136
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:25,922
He has to have some
kind of a weak point.

137
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:27,190
[SANJI] When you're
frying a fish this big,

138
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:30,660
you gotta scale and debone it
before you put it in the pan.

139
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:36,499
[USOPP] Maybe it's not
completely hopeless.

140
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,334
But, I'm scared.

141
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,670
[OARS laughs]

142
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,371
[OARS]
Smashin' time!

143
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:43,406
Here he comes!

144
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,377
Now Gum-Gum...

145
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:51,347
...Giant Butt Stomp!

146
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,453
That is not one
of Luffy's moves!

147
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,455
Run!

148
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,429
Gum-Gum...

149
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,898
Franky, look out!
He's comin' right for you!

150
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,068
[OARS]
...Hammer!

151
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:16,806
'Kay, punk.

152
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:19,775
You've only left us
with one option here.

153
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,043
You wanna fight?

154
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:24,113
Then feel the power
of all of us combined!

155
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,748
Heads up, you guys!

156
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,417
[FRANKY]
I know the plan!

157
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:31,721
We're takin' him down
with Tactic 15!

158
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:33,723
We're what?

159
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:34,790
Really?

160
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,093
But it... It's still untested!

161
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:41,731
[FRANKY]
Zoro! Eyebrows! Standby!

162
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:43,733
Standby for what?

163
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:44,634
[FRANKY]
Trust me!

164
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,736
Just grab onto my legs!

165
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:49,105
[SANJI] This feels like
it's about to get weird.

166
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:51,574
Here we go!

167
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:53,075
Let's do this!

168
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:55,578
Wow!

169
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,810
[CHOPPER]
Pirates. Docking Six!

170
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:30,179
[USOPP]
Giant Robot Warrior!

171
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:34,016
[FRANKY]
Big Emperor!

172
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:46,896
Hey, wait a minute, Franky!

173
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:48,964
What, is somethin'
wrong, Chopper?

174
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:49,799
We're not complete!

175
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:52,635
The left arm
still isn't docked yet!

176
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:57,640
[FRANKY] What the hell
are you doing to us, Robin?

177
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,742
Hurry up and dock
onto my left arm!

178
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:01,177
[CHOPPER]
Robin! We need you!

179
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,211
[USOPP]
Come on, it's fine!

180
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,979
Just do what I'm doing!

181
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,681
No.

182
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,985
I am not embarrassing
myself like that.

183
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,657
She won't...

184
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,825
...embarrass...

185
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,660
...herself l-like that.

186
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,729
As human beings,
you should be ashamed.

187
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,931
She rejected us!

188
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:27,670
Wassa matter?
She won't do it?

189
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,872
[SANJI] What, why are
you acting all disappointed?

190
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:34,110
Why ya think?
I wanna see the robot!

191
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:38,781
Do it, you jerks!
Do the docking!

192
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:44,086
Oh, man.

193
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,022
I've never been so relieved
to get punched before.

194
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:48,791
That really was embarrassing.

195
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:51,927
[FRANKY]
Why'd you bail on us, Robin?

196
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,697
We could've formed the
Robot Warrior Big Emperor!

197
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,132
[CHOPPER]
Betrayed by one of our own!

198
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:57,299
Who'd have thought?

199
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,135
[USOPP] Luffy never would've
left us hanging like that,

200
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:00,603
you know!

201
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,205
Don't ever ask me
to "dock" with you again.

202
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:04,206
I'm serious.

203
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:11,080
[FRANKY] Alright,
it's time for a fresh start!

204
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:13,082
[ZORO]
Franky!

205
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:15,785
I hope you don't mind me
borrowing these things.

206
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:20,256
[FRANKY] Hey, hold on!
Those are my heavy nunchucks!

207
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:21,557
Alright, fine.

208
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,058
But don't break them!

209
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:27,129
Listen, you sack of crap.

210
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,397
It's time to finish this.

211
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:31,834
I'm not gonna let you keep me
from saving Nami any longer.

212
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:37,973
Perfect size.

213
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,142
Let's do this. Heads up!

214
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:47,082
You again.

215
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,252
Robin!

216
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:51,120
[ROBIN]
Hmm?

217
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:53,155
I'm gonna give
his left arm a pounding

218
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,758
and then I need you to put
him in a submission hold!

219
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,027
Sure, you got it.

220
00:12:58,093 --> 00:12:59,295
Let's do this!

221
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:15,211
Let's see, it must
be around here somewhere.

222
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,951
[BROOK]
Found it! The kitchen.

223
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,628
Hello, is there anyone in here?

224
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:35,197
I'm letting myself in, okay?

225
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,001
[BROOK]
My goodness,

226
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:41,203
it looks like a hurricane
came through here.

227
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,808
[BROOK] Regardless, they should
still have what I'm looking for.

228
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:54,016
[BROOK] Wait, wha... is...
no, is that? Could it be?

229
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:55,150
Milk?!

230
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,088
I could never have
wished to stumble upon

231
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:00,890
a more fortuitous beverage!

232
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,926
Finger bones crossed
it hasn't expired yet.

233
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:08,163
[BROOK]
No...

234
00:14:08,197 --> 00:14:09,198
Oh, why?

235
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:11,667
Wait!

236
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,836
It's barely expired,
so it's okay!

237
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:16,939
I'll chew down the curdled
chunks for everyone's sake!

238
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:19,275
[BROOK]
Time to build up these bones!

239
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:29,285
[BROOK]
I feel it!

240
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:32,354
The power!
It's pulsing through me!

241
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:36,191
The calcium's rejuvenating
all of my internal organs!

242
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:37,226
Which is odd since I don't

243
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:39,962
actually have internal organs!

244
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:46,035
I am...

245
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:49,305
...refreshed!

246
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:50,573
Oh, it's too much!

247
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:54,043
The rush is making my eyes spin,
not that I have eyes, of course.

248
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,445
That's enough, Brook,

249
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,413
let's not become
giddy with power

250
00:14:57,446 --> 00:15:00,049
when you still have
an important job to do!

251
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:03,419
[BROOK]
Now.

252
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:06,722
I need to find
what I actually came here for.

253
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:16,398
[BROOK]
It almost seems too obvious.

254
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,243
[BROOK]
Found it!

255
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:38,646
[BROOK] I have to wonder
why they even keep this stuff.

256
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,005
Mistress Perona!

257
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,139
What's up?

258
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,108
[ZOMBIE 367A] The refrigerator
is packed to the hilt.

259
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,143
It's almost overflowing.

260
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,346
[PERONA] There's plenty of
room left in the pantry, right?

261
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,380
Just use that.

262
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,982
[ZOMBIE 367A]
Yes, ma'am!

263
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,483
And hurry it up
with the treasure!

264
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,386
There had better not be
one single jewel left behind!

265
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,455
[ZOMBIES]
Yes, ma'am!

266
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,132
Robin!

267
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:40,966
[ROBIN]
Hm?

268
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,868
I'm gonna give
his left arm a pounding

269
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,138
and then I need you to
put him in a submission hold!

270
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,373
Sure, you got it.

271
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,807
Let's do this!

272
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,981
[SANJI] Hey, come and get me,
ya Luffy imposter!

273
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,384
[OARS]
You!

274
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,487
I'm gonna squish you!

275
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,090
Now Gum-Gum...

276
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,026
Usopp! This is your chance!

277
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,495
Coming right up! Take this!

278
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,164
Let's see how ya like
my Special Oil Star!

279
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,999
Triple Shot Punishment!

280
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,375
[ZORO] Hey, Eyebrows!
Gimme a boost, will ya?

281
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,111
[SANJI] What? While you're
carrying those big ass things?

282
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,113
Well if you're not man enough.

283
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,015
[SANJI]
What'd you say?

284
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,450
Of course I can handle it!

285
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,186
[SANJI]
Armee De L'air...

286
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,223
Power Shoot!

287
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,962
[ZORO]
Great Shock... Slash!

288
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,572
Now, Cien Fleurs!

289
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,146
[ROBIN]
Big Tree!

290
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,416
What the...? What's that?

291
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,089
And Clutch!

292
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,262
I can't stand like this!
I'm gonna fall!

293
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,934
[FRANKY]
Keep those planks comin', bro!

294
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:26,071
Behold the might of my
super midair stair-building!

295
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:31,443
[FRANKY]
The Franky Skywalk!

296
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,514
[FRANKY] It'll get us to the top
but it won't hold much longer!

297
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,484
So we gotta make
this snappy, Chopper!

298
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,518
Right!

299
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,491
--Super...
--Super...

300
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,160
--Frapper...
--Frapper...

301
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,428
Gong!

302
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,935
Doesn't matter how big you are,

303
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,605
the weak points
of a body never change.

304
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,274
[CHOPPER] One crack of the jaw,
and the brain goes spinning!

305
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,151
You're lookin' a little dizzy,

306
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,353
and you've only got
one leg holdin' you up.

307
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,623
[SANJI] You're goin' down,
Luffy monster.

308
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,230
Bad Manners...

309
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,367
Kick...

310
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,302
Course!

311
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,148
Fall, damn you, fall!

312
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,488
Your face is about to
get introduced to the ground.

313
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,557
Come on! Fall down!

314
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,408
We did it!

315
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,411
There's no stopping
the power of the Straw Hats!

316
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,445
Damn straight!

317
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,447
How's that dirt taste, jerk?

318
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,093
Slow start,

319
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,128
but score one.

320
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,401
Whoa. You see that?

321
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,270
What the hell's
happening over there?

322
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,708
This is nuts.

323
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,111
The mansion's crumbling.
It's almost all gone.

324
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,046
[ZOMBIE 367C] Why's he
flipping around like that?

325
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,414
Is it a circus act?

326
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,251
Uh, I know it sounds stupid,

327
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,786
but do you think somebody
could've taken him down?

328
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,056
[ZOMBIE 367C] Yeah, you're
right. That does sound stupid.

329
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,659
A thousand man army couldn't
put a scratch on that guy!

330
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,562
Yeah but still.

331
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,231
Why else would he just be
lying there like that?

332
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:13,238
[OARS] Ow, ow, ow,
this really hurts.

333
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,800
Stupid bunch
of little sea slugs.

334
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,770
Now you really pissed me off!

335
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:50,676
I'm gonna grind you
down into pirate dust!

336
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:59,451
Impossible. Can Oars
really be losing to them?

337
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,857
[PERONA] Well, whatever.
I've paid my dues.

338
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,694
I've given Moria a large
enough chunk of my life.

339
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,329
There's no way
in hell I'm sticking around

340
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,631
if I'm in danger
of losing all of it.

341
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,301
[PERONA] Move it,
you worthless meat bags!

342
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,069
We've gotta get out of here

343
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,870
before the
whole island goes down!

344
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,706
[ZOMBIES]
Yes, ma'am!

345
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:21,873
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 367A]
You heard her!

346
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,309
Get everything off the dock
and on this ship, pronto!

347
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,644
[ZOMBIES]
Aye aye!

348
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,520
Who the hell is this guy?

349
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,189
Don't look like no zombie.

350
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,824
What're ya doin' on this ship?

351
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,259
[ZOMBIE BUNNY WHITE] Lookin'
down on us doin' all the work.

352
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,662
That bastard is
about as big as a bear.

353
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,832
[KUMA]
A bear, huh?

354
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,534
You're more astute
than I would've expected.

355
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,184
[KUMA] Now tell me, where can
I find your master Moria?

356
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,632
[KUMA]
If you could take a vacation,

357
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,300
where is it you'd like to go?

358
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,702
[NAMI] Who are you
and what do you want?

359
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,270
Did you come for Luffy?

360
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,739
Are you really one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea?

361
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,275
[KUMA]
I am free to do whatever I wish.

362
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,476
[NAMI]
This guy is bad news.

363
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,878
I need to warn the others.

364
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,479
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

365
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,814
"The Silent Assault!!

366
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,617
The Mysterious Visitor,
'Tyrant' Kuma."

367
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,420
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates.
