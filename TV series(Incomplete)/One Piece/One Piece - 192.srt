1
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:50,790
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,250
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,919
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,588
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,091
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:04,554
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:10,268
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:18,109
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow</i>

9
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:22,739
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:25,909
<i>Sailed toward different dreams</i>

11
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,911
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:32,957
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see</i>

13
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:38,338
<i>And we know that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here</i>

14
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:42,342
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny</i>

15
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:45,053
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,347
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,602
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past</i>

18
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:54,479
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:59,401
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>We know we'll get there</i>

20
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,444
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:07,200
<i>Every tear that we've cried</i>
<i>only helps our dreams come true</i>

22
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:14,249
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life</i>

23
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:21,756
<i>A glimpse of the sun rising</i>
<i>on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:31,224
[NARRATOR] At God's Shrine,
Luffy and Nami found themselves

25
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:33,685
unable to reach Eneru's ark.

26
00:02:33,768 --> 00:02:36,521
[NAMI] He's too far from
the top of the beanstalk.

27
00:02:36,604 --> 00:02:37,939
What can we do?

28
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:39,399
How can we get to him?

29
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:42,527
There must be a way!

30
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:45,447
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile,

31
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,158
Eneru had finally
located the Golden Bell.

32
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,537
So this is it.

33
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,751
Splendid!

34
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,085
At last!

35
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:01,504
The grand belfry that
was once the pride

36
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:04,007
of the legendary
city of Shandora!

37
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,760
[NARRATOR] Devising a plan,
Nami sent a message

38
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:09,262
down to Usopp and
the rest of the crew.

39
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,308
[AISA]
Hey, look!

40
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,893
There's something written on it!

41
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:19,731
"Cut down this beanstalk
and make sure it falls

42
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:21,149
towards the West."

43
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:28,782
[NARRATOR] But, Eneru's final
attack was already bearing down

44
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:29,908
upon them!

45
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:35,455
[ENERU] I've accomplished
all of my objectives but one.

46
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:36,706
So now...

47
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:41,836
...it's time I destroyed
this pathetic land

48
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,172
and the Cumuloregalis
Clouds it rests on,

49
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:46,591
and set off for
the Endless Vearth.

50
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:48,677
[ZORO yells]

51
00:03:57,644 --> 00:03:58,853
[WYPER]
Reject!

52
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,154
[WYPER]
Now fall, Giant Jack! Fall!

53
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:17,205
This is it! Get on, Luffy!

54
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:18,915
Gun it! Go! Now!

55
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:19,791
[NAMI]
Okay!

56
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:21,001
[NAMI yells]

57
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:26,756
[ENERU laughs]

58
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,842
That you should even
try to reach me now

59
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:32,220
is insolent far beyond
the point of stupidity!

60
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:34,639
Now pay for your folly!

61
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:36,224
Mamaragan!

62
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:44,482
[LUFFY]
"Miracle on Skypiea!

63
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:46,526
The Love Song
Heard in the Clouds!"

64
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:54,743
[CITIZEN A]
Upper Yard is crumbling.

65
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:01,958
Luffy! Nami!

66
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:07,088
[NAMI]
You know...

67
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:10,300
I think he's trying to make sure
you don't get near him again!

68
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:12,218
Too bad! He's mine!

69
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:17,974
He's destroying the cloud
cover over the ruins!

70
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:24,439
He plans to destroy
the ground itself!

71
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:28,568
[AISA] But Wyper's lying
on the ground down there!

72
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:31,988
[USOPP]
So is Zoro! That bastard!

73
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:38,244
The ruins...

74
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:47,379
[WYPER]
It won't work, Eneru.

75
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,925
This city will
never fall to you.

76
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:54,844
[AISA gasps]
Wyper!

77
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:03,728
[WYPER]
This land of Shandora

78
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:06,189
was home to a proud
race of warriors.

79
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:15,907
This ancient city preserves
and protects their memory.

80
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,244
What's more, their memory
protects this city.

81
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:21,913
That mighty power
will never fall to you.

82
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:25,417
No matter how
much forest you burn.

83
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:41,933
[USOPP, AISA gasp]

84
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,149
This land won't fall!

85
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:02,328
[AISA yells]
No! Wyper!

86
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:05,248
--[ROBIN] It's too dangerous!
--Ah! Let me go! Wyper!

[yells]

88
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,335
Eh?

89
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:11,004
I can still hear the little
fools whining down below.

90
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:13,298
[laughs]

[GAN FALL]
The Vearth. Of course!

96
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:05,892
[SHANDORAN A]
It didn't fall!

97
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:08,436
Upper Yard is still standing!

98
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:16,027
Its power is unbelievable!

99
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:22,701
[GAN FALL]
It must be.

100
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:25,078
The Vearth is so powerful.

101
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:31,251
What fools we've been!

102
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:34,337
It was never something
to be fought over!

103
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:36,965
We've spilled so much blood.

104
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:40,010
And lost so many
countless lives.

105
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:44,764
How could we be so
blind for 400 years?

Come on, this way,
let's move it! Move it!

110
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:05,201
Now go!

[LUFFY]
Here I come, Eneru!

114
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:25,472
Those fools never learn.

115
00:09:25,555 --> 00:09:27,766
[LUFFY]
Give back the Golden Bell!

116
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:30,393
Right now!

No! Don't do it, please!

130
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:28,368
[NAMI] The air currents and
lightning discharges in there

131
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:30,412
could kill even you!

132
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:32,664
[ENERU] What do you think
you can do against

133
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:34,582
this kind of power?

134
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,667
Man of rubber!

[LUFFY] You with your
thunder and lightning!

145
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,702
We made it all the
way to sky island,

146
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:55,455
and you had to come along
and ruin the weather!

147
00:11:55,538 --> 00:11:58,083
You electrical freak!

148
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:04,255
Uh, what's with all the
crazy lightning bolts?

149
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:07,842
[ENERU]
I forgot!

150
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:11,221
That gold ball stuck on his
arm is a natural conductor!

151
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:17,894
Well then.

152
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:20,730
I'll just drop it before you
can discharge the electricity!

Let everything be destroyed!

Captain McKinley!

Please stop it!

156
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:35,578
This is God's land!

157
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:36,788
It is pointless!

158
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:38,790
[MCKINLEY]
I don't care if it's pointless.

159
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:40,792
It's the only thing people
can do when they're caught

160
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,836
between life and death.

161
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,004
Don't you see?

162
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:48,800
We've abandoned our home
and chosen to live.

163
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:50,343
We can't go back.

164
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:51,928
Nor can we go forward.

165
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:55,598
Praying.

166
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:56,891
Is all that we can do.

167
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:02,605
[GAN FALL]
The song of the island.

168
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:05,734
When our ears hear that again,

169
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:07,652
the war will have ended.

170
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:13,908
[CONIS]
I wonder...

171
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:15,326
Are we all doomed?

172
00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:21,666
Maybe, if I'd had the courage
to stand up to Eneru...

173
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,377
...our friends would have
been spared all this.

174
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:27,047
Oh, Suu...

[SUU]
Suu?

176
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:31,551
Does God exist?

177
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:34,804
If He does...

178
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:36,765

Please. If You do exist...

181
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,111
...You must protect those
brave people and keep them safe!

182
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:52,989
Please! Give us a miracle!

183
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:56,034

That mass of thunderclouds
has vanished!

What could've happened?

Yeah! It's him, Luffy!

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

196
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:49,939
Now ring it, Straw Hat!

197
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:53,818
Light the fire of Shandora!

198
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:55,445
Go, Luffy! Go, Luffy!

00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:57,655
[GAN FALL]
Let me hear it, Straw Hat!

200
00:15:57,739 --> 00:15:59,366
The song of the island!

You destroyed my Raigo!

Insolent Blue Sea ape!

204

You're next!

205
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:18,510
I'll ring you along
with the bell!

...Amaru!

What the hell is that?

211
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:38,780
[ENERU]
Ring the bell?

212
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:41,199
Is that what you said?

213
00:16:41,282 --> 00:16:43,159
You must be one of
those fools who believes

214
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:45,245
in the old legend
that when the bell rings,

215
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:50,333
it will mean the end of the war
between Skypiea and Shandora!

216
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,252
I am God!

I don't care how strong you are.

220
00:17:00,593 --> 00:17:02,929
You're still just
a Paramecia type!

221
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:05,932
You could never match
the might of my Logia power

222
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:07,892
no matter how hard you try!

223
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:09,811
No matter what you might do!

224
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:20,280
That won't work on me!

225
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,743
And quit calling yourself God!

226
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:28,496
What kind of god destroys
everything and saves nothing?

227
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,748
Fake!

[LUFFY grunts, yells]

229
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:47,015
Well done, rubber man,
that was very agile of you.

230
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:49,059
You grabbed it before
you could be impaled.

231
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:50,435
Luffy!

[ENERU laughs]

233
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,189
But what will you do now?

234
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:55,940
You have nowhere to run!

235
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:59,235
The pull of the
golden ball on your arm

236
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,905
will draw you deeper and
deeper onto my trident!

237
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:05,241
And if you should let go,
you'll fall to your death below!

[LUFFY yelling]

239
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,705
I admit I'm impressed
you made it this far.

240
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,540
But this is the end
for you, boy.

241
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,418
And this land. Everything!

242
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:17,671
I can easily create
another Raigo!

244
00:18:22,092 --> 00:18:27,055
[CONIS] It's the duty of every
citizen here on the Island.

00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:29,474
I'm so very sorry!

really be destroyed?

What's this?

00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,646
You should never mess
with me, earlobes!

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,858
Now, Gum-Gum...

00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,997
Are you going to try
that same old trick again?

261
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,292
I'll keep trying
till the bell rings!

262
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,002
This time I'll skewer you, fool!

return, what will you think

when you see we're gone?

Hold on a little longer!

on the island of Jaya
in the Grand Line,

284
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:27,277
I saw the City of Gold!

285
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:33,700
The City of Gold does exist!

286
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,501
Not one person in history

00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:47,881
has ever disproven, heh,
the existence of sky island.

Can you hear it?

The City of Gold is here!

00:22:04,564 --> 00:22:07,275
For 400 years,

I can hear the bell.

Now this is romance!

00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:47,584
I'd thought the story
was just a fairy tale

313
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:49,210
and I'd almost forgotten it.

314
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,837
But there's only one
bell in the world

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,297
that sounds like that!

316
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,883
The City of Gold was in the sky!

wasn't a liar!
