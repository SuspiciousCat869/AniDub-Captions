00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,076
But it won't
last long in that lava!

186
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:25,743
Move!

187
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:27,945
Hurry up and finish him off!

188
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,215
[LUFFY] Right.
Thanks for saving me, Nami.

189
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:34,085
Just give up already.
You'll never win.

190
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:35,419
No, you're wrong.

191
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:37,421
And as soon as I finish you off,

192
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:40,791
we're gonna set sail
for the New World.

193
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,327
[ACCINO] I guess idiocy
is common among you pirates.

194
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,330
You really are all the same,
aren't you?

195
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:48,099
"I'm headed to the New World."

196
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:50,067
"I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates."

197
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:53,137
Head in the clouds,
not a doubt in your mind.

198
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,371
Don't get me wrong.

199
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:57,308
It's quite convenient for me.

200
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,944
Get it?
Thanks to idiots like you,

201
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:03,781
my family has a fortune in
the bounty hunting business.

202
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:06,917
[laughing]

203
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:08,853
[ACCINO] A bunch of damn morons,

204
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:12,022
ready to throw your lives away
over some useless flag,

205
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:14,725
over some useless
sense of pride!

206
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,795
Makes my job easy,
I'll tell you that!

207
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:19,430
[laughing]

208
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:21,732
[LUFFY] Shut your mouth.

209
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:25,202
[ACCINO] Why? Did I say
something to offend you?

210
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:26,771
That's enough.

211
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:29,273
Got it? It's over.

212
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:32,843
Prepare yourself,
Naked Balloon Man!

213
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,278
Prepare myself?

214
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:35,045
What?

215
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:37,948
[laughing]

216
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:39,750
So the only option
you've got left

217
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:41,886
is to bluff
your way out, huh?

218
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,121
[ACCINO]
Come on. Take a look around!

219
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:45,956
You've got the
flames of oblivion

220
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,025
creeping in
from every direction!

221
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:51,328
Of course, it's no problem for
me to stick around here, but--

222
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:54,398
For people like you,
it's gotta be unbearable.

223
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:57,902
Like standing inside
a giant boiling pot!

224
00:12:57,935 --> 00:12:59,904
Huh! This is nothing.

225
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:00,971
Huh?

226
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:04,108
[LUFFY] You're not as
hot as you think you are.

227
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:06,277
In fact, from
the way I look at it,

228
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,013
you're as cold as ice
compared to my heat.

229
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:10,915
Huh?

230
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:12,483
[laughing]

231
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:13,884
You're out of your mind!

232
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,187
You actually think
you're hotter than me?

233
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,322
Ha!
My temperature is even higher

234
00:13:18,355 --> 00:13:20,424
than all this lava
surrounding us!

235
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:21,792
If you don't think that's hot,

236
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:23,460
why don't you
take a little swim?

237
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:24,995
[laughing]

238
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:26,931
[LUFFY] You're all talk!

239
00:13:26,964 --> 00:13:29,967
If you think you can take me,
then come at me already!

240
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,936
I'm gonna beat
the hell outta you!

241
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:34,505
Huh? What was that?

242
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:36,273
Aw, how dare you!

243
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:39,543
I'll burn you at
ten thousand degrees!

244
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:41,545
Is that really
all you've got?

245
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,414
How about this?

246
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:48,052
I'm burning at
1 million degrees!

247
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:50,120
[LUFFY] Gum-Gum...

248
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:51,488
Have it your way!

249
00:13:51,522 --> 00:13:53,791
You really wanna end this?

250
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:55,226
You got it!

251
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:57,394
[laughing]

252
00:13:57,428 --> 00:14:02,533
...One Million Degree Bazooka!

253
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:03,934
Whoa! Careful!

254
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,369
You're gonna melt your hands!

255
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:07,905
It's not that hot.
This is nothing.

256
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:10,875
It's not hot. This is nothing!

257
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:13,544
[ACCINO] No! That's impossible!

258
00:14:13,577 --> 00:14:18,249
[yelling]

259
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:21,518
Now fly!

260
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:40,004
[groaning]

261
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:46,944
And now, to find our flag.

262
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:08,132
What's that?

263
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:11,135
What the hell?

264
00:15:11,168 --> 00:15:12,503
What's going on here?

265
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,071
[CHOPPER] Look! Over there!

266
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:16,206
[ZORO] Luffy!

267
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,942
[USOPP]
What's he doing out there?

268
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:19,610
Hey!

269
00:15:19,643 --> 00:15:22,079
Look, Luffy!
We got the flag--

270
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:25,416
What do you know--It's my crew!

271
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:26,550
Hey!

272
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:30,220
What do you guys think
you're doing over there, huh?

273
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:32,089
No! He saw us!

274
00:15:32,122 --> 00:15:34,091
Great, so now what?

275
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:35,359
[NAMI] Everyone!

276
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,931
Hurry!
Let's head back to the ship!

277
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:41,432
Right.

278
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:42,333
Yeah.

279
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:44,401
--[SANJI] Let's go!
--[ZORO] Move it!

280
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:45,402
[LUFFY] What the--?

281
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:46,236
Come back!

282
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,071
Hey! Guys!

283
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:51,175
I wanna ask you
about our flag! Hey!

284
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,509
Listen! Stick to the plan!

285
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:54,945
We can't let him know the truth!

286
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:56,080
[LUFFY] Come back!

287
00:15:56,113 --> 00:15:57,414
He's right behind us!

288
00:15:57,448 --> 00:15:59,350
Stop! Wait!
Why are you running?

289
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:01,051
What about our flag?

290
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,287
[ALL] Sorry, can't hear you!
Sorry, can't hear you!

291
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,122
Sorry, can't hear you!
Sorry!

292
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:07,091
Hey! You're back!

293
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:08,258
Hurry it up!

294
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,894
--[LUFFY] Hey, you guys!

295
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,196
--He's almost here!
--[LUFFY] Hey, you guys!

296
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:13,330
[USOPP]
What's the plan?

297
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:15,232
Sanji! Zoro!

298
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,202
Aye-aye. Let's do it.

299
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:19,236
[SANJI] Fly!

300
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:23,507
[screaming]

301
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,376
Here we go, Usopp.

302
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:27,277
Make sure to hang it
nice and straight.

303
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:28,712
What? Wait a minute!

304
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:31,081
Usopp Cannon!

305
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,249
[USOPP] I'm flying!

306
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,283
Franky!

307
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:34,718
Leave it to me!

308
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:37,321
Coup de Boo!

309
00:16:37,354 --> 00:16:39,323
Why'd it have
to be cola farts?

310
00:16:42,226 --> 00:16:43,961
Hey, what are you guys doing?

311
00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:45,429
You let our flag get stolen!

312
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,031
We need to hurry
and get it back!

313
00:16:47,064 --> 00:16:48,332
Stolen? The flag?

314
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:49,733
What on earth
are you talking about?

315
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:52,236
You probably just had
a bad dream or something.

316
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:53,203
Right?

317
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:54,238
Uh... Sure!

318
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,239
Yeah, that's it!

319
00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:57,341
[laughing awkwardly]

320
00:16:57,374 --> 00:16:59,309
Here, see for yourself.

321
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:07,551
What the--

322
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:09,486
It's right there,
safe and sound!

323
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,355
That stupid clone guy.

324
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:13,690
He must've been lying to me.

325
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:14,691
I'm sorry.

326
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:16,593
I shouldn't have doubted you.

327
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:19,263
It's okay. No worries.

328
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:20,297
Oh man.

329
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,299
That sure was a close one.

330
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:26,086
Yay... I made it...

331
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,315
[GUYLE] Excellent work!

332
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,483
[GUYLE laughing]

333
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,618
[GUYLE]
I knew you could do it!

334
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,620
You did a great job, Jiro!

335
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,221
Now you're a true man.

336
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,923
Way to go!

337
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,024
[STANSEN] Jiro...

338
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,927
I knew we could count on you
to get the flag back.

339
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,895
Well done.

340
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:46,165
I can't tell you how
proud I am. Thank you.

341
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,504
Captain...

342
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,011
But why?

343
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,512
[PUZZLE] Jiro...

344
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,948
I think you should
hang the flag,

345
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,318
because the Phoenix Pirates
are setting sail!

346
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,054
Yes, Captain!

347
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,323
Yeah!

348
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,958
Come on! Let's do it!

349
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:20,999
[ALL cheering]

350
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,007
[STANSEN sobbing quietly]

351
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:36,815
Stansen.

352
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:40,385
Like I said before, your
decision was the correct one.

353
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:44,289
I'm sorry all my failures
caused you so much trouble.

354
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:56,201
[sobbing loudly]

355
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,370
[PUZZLE]
Are you watching, Vigaro?

356
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:02,074
Your death won't be in vain.
I promise.

357
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,208
[PUZZLE] All right, men!

358
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,009
We're off!

359
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,011
[ALL cheering]

360
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,520
Hey, look!

361
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,321
I don't know what's happening,
but I know I don't like it!

362
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,357
Accino went nuts
with his heat powers,

363
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,693
causing the volcano under the
ocean floor to become active.

364
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:23,896
We need to hurry!

365
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,765
It's only a matter of time
before this thing erupts!

366
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,700
Right! Then let's set sail!

367
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,002
Move it!

368
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,403
[ALL] Aye-aye!

369
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,259
[USOPP] The whole island...

370
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,561
It's gone!

371
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,263
Phew!
Man, that was a close one.

372
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,072
There you are.

373
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,041
You're in big trouble!

374
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,209
How could you let the Straw Hats

375
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,444
get their hands on
Papa's flag collection?

376
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,446
Have you lost your m--

377
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,381
Shut up for one second!

378
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:24,590
Listen. I'm sorry.

379
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,191
Big sister?

380
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,626
I got caught up in my marriage

381
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,561
and didn't pay
you enough attention.

382
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,764
Come on, let's go apologize
to Papa together, okay?

383
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,334
I'm sure he'll
understand about the flags.

384
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,703
After all, we're family, right?

385
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,137
Arbell...

386
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,472
My Lil.

387
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,111
[ARBELL, LIL]
La-lala-lala!

388
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,780
--La-lala-lala!
--[SALCHOW] Aw! So sweet!

389
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:52,818
Reconciling with your little
sister is just so adorable!

390
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,123
No... No!

391
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,259
Straw Hat! How could--

392
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,695
Papa! I'm sorry, but better
late than never, right?

393
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,264
Here you go!

394
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,733
Happy Birthday to Papa!

395
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,767
Eh?

396
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,741
[ACCINO] It's--It's a--
It looks like a--

397
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,609
Damn Straw Hat!

398
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,516
[ACCINO FAMILY screaming]

399
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,652
[BRINDO] Hey! Where's Campacino?

400
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,421
How could he be missing
at a time like this?

401
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,124
[CAMPACINO] Straw Hat!

402
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,127
I swear upon the honor
of the Accino family,

403
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,763
you and your crew
will never escape!

404
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,699
Get lost, you annoying
clone-twin guy!

405
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:44,503
I'll make you pay
for what you did to Papa!

406
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,774
Campacino!

407
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,709
What? It's Puzzle!

408
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,479
I'll be your opponent!

409
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,682
You and I have
a score to settle!

410
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,250
Hey, Straw Hat!

411
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,351
This guy is mine!

412
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,386
Stay out of this! Got it?

413
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,354
He is?

414
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,456
[PUZZLE] You go on ahead!

415
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:09,528
And be prepared to face me when
we meet again in the New World!

416
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,166
Right! I'll be ready for you!

417
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,768
Damn you! Die!

418
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,870
Let's go!

419
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,472
[ALL] Aye-aye!

420
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,276
Jiro!

421
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,077
Luffy, turn around!

422
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,412
We have to go back
and help them!

423
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,348
They're gonna get
themselves killed!

424
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:29,915
You're wrong.

425
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,217
Take a look, Chopper.

426
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,185
They won't lose.

427
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,220
They're doing better than ever.

428
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:47,933
Yeah, you're right.

429
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,670
Hey! You!

430
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,572
Why are you still
hanging around?

431
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,640
Hurry up and leave!

432
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,877
Bye! We'll see you in
the New World, Doctor!

433
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,780
Bye! Until then, Jiro!

434
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,618
Sunny, full speed ahead!

435
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,887
Set course for the New World!

436
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,589
[ALL] Yeah!

437
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,966
[CHOPPER]
Greetings to one and all!

438
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,701
It's me, Chopperman!

439
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,302
It's been a while, huh?

440
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,270
Well, guess what?

441
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,873
Your dreams have come true,
you big jerks!

442
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,708
'Cause I'm back!

443
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,011
Get ready for my
Killer Cute Spark!

444
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,713
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

445
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,481
Chopperman to the Rescue!

446
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,017
Protect the TV Station
By The Shore!

447
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,887
I'm gonna be a giant robot?
