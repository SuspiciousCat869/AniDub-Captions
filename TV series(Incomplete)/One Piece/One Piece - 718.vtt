WEBVTT

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.515
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.420
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:45.565
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.969
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:51.376
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.280
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:55.785
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:58.558
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:02.899
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:04.401
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:08.544
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:12.919
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:18.196
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.099
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law,

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:24.442
intending to destroy a Devil
Fruit Factory in Dressrosa.

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:27.481
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:27.515 --> 00:03:30.354
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.491
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:34.796
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.967
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.873
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:41.843 --> 00:03:43.747
[KYROS] Compared to
all the despicable acts

00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:46.720
you committed against
the people of Dressrosa,

00:03:46.753 --> 00:03:51.362
what I suffer now...
is scarcely pain at all!

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:56.640
I am this kingdom's
"solid" rage, manifested.

00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:01.382
[KYROS]
Here to collect payback!

00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:05.490
Half Moon Glaive!

00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:10.467
Trueno...

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.007
...Bastardo!

00:04:17.214 --> 00:04:20.453
[screams]

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:26.398
[REBECCA, KYROS gasp]

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:30.841
I thought Zoro had him!
That's Pica!

00:04:35.785 --> 00:04:39.626
Oh, Diamante.
That's a real bad look

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.832
for a top Executive
in our Family.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.908
[LUFFY]
"Moving Across the Ground!

00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:07.615
The Giant Statue
Pica's Surprise Maneuver!"

00:05:21.543 --> 00:05:26.085
[LUFFY] Stop it, Bellamy!
You're really gonna die!

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:27.321
Fight me, Straw Hat!

00:05:27.355 --> 00:05:28.958
Screw your sympathy!

00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:30.528
I won't hit you!

00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:33.934
When will ya get that
through your thick skull?

00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:35.771
[BELLAMY grunts]

00:05:44.556 --> 00:05:47.995
Hey, Bellamy!
Knock it off already!

00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:50.702
Shut your mouth!

00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:53.741
I get to decide
when and where I die!

00:05:53.774 --> 00:05:57.080
You're gonna be
King of the Pirates, right?

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.527
[BELLAMY] Then you should
be able to take me out!

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:10.139
Now fight me, Straw Hat!

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:24.034
[REBECCA]
Father!

00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:28.476
[KYROS groans] As foreseen.
I did not come here

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.683
for a mere one-on-one skirmish!

00:06:31.716 --> 00:06:35.691
As long an enemy stands,
the fight persists!

00:06:36.693 --> 00:06:39.398
You can barely move!
Please don't do this!

00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:41.335
[KYROS]
Fall back, Rebecca!

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:43.372
I'll see this to the end.

00:06:43.406 --> 00:06:46.045
I will eradicate
these parasites.

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:48.551
Our king will reign again!

00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:51.690
My life is a small price to pay!

00:06:53.326 --> 00:06:54.896
[PICA]
Quick question.

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:58.737
Why is old King Riku
worth a squat to you people?

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.114
Rebecca, isn't he the reason why
everybody hates you so much?

00:07:06.318 --> 00:07:07.556
As for Kyros.

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:10.093
King Riku is the cause
of your stump leg.

00:07:10.126 --> 00:07:12.599
If you hadn't protected him,
you wouldn't have

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:15.203
been stuck as a toy
for a whole decade!

00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:17.040
Why do you respect that puke?

00:07:17.073 --> 00:07:18.209
That's nonsense!

00:07:18.242 --> 00:07:20.515
You despicable
people framed him!

00:07:20.548 --> 00:07:24.622
My father-in-law is
my personal savior!

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:28.564
He showed benevolence
to this young ruffian.

00:07:28.598 --> 00:07:31.704
The Riku bloodline
upheld a reputation

00:07:31.737 --> 00:07:35.811
for being a family that
understood the value of peace!

00:07:35.844 --> 00:07:38.049
This kingdom may not
have had the treasures

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:39.852
and wealth it does today.

00:07:39.886 --> 00:07:43.727
But that does not mean
the people were displeased.

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.403
[sighs]

00:07:48.436 --> 00:07:51.275
[KYROS] Our richness
came from routine joys.

00:07:51.308 --> 00:07:54.048
Clear skies. Thriving blossoms.

00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:56.385
A kingdom of gentle hearts!

00:07:56.418 --> 00:07:59.124
That's the backbone
on which we flourished!

00:07:59.157 --> 00:08:03.332
Money and jewels only serve to
impress the trite and vapid.

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:06.606
True happiness is
the liberty of life.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.512
His morals have
resonated within me.

00:08:09.545 --> 00:08:13.286
Because they are the
mark of a true leader.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:14.822
Our entire nation wishes for

00:08:14.856 --> 00:08:17.394
your wicked Family's
swift removal

00:08:17.427 --> 00:08:20.032
so he may reign again!

00:08:26.112 --> 00:08:27.948
[PICA]
I see.

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:32.958
[REBECCA]
Huh? He left.

00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:36.966
What's going on?

00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:43.012
[REBECCA gasps]

00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:45.784
[PICA]
Charlestone!

00:08:47.187 --> 00:08:52.397
[screams] The hell?
That scared the crap outta me!

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.268
Pica escaped to the third level!

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:56.438
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:08:56.472 --> 00:08:57.842
[ZORO]
What a pain in the ass.

00:08:57.876 --> 00:09:00.079
He's supposed to fight me!

00:09:00.113 --> 00:09:01.449
Why's he in such a hurry?

00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:03.185
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:09:08.062 --> 00:09:09.966
How am I supposed to
knock the snot out of him

00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:13.574
when he's scurrying
around like a damn mole?

00:09:13.607 --> 00:09:16.045
As soon as I close in
on him, he's done!

00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:17.147
[PICA]
Charlestone!

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.482
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:21.188
Lord Pica, please have
mercy on us! [screams]

00:09:21.222 --> 00:09:23.694
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE 718B] Did
you forget we're on your team?

00:09:23.727 --> 00:09:27.768
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:32.745
Hunting the injured?
Spineless prick.

00:09:32.778 --> 00:09:34.549
Here it comes!
So watch yourself!

00:09:34.582 --> 00:09:35.951
Okay, honey-pie!

00:09:35.984 --> 00:09:37.287
Aahh! Let me go!

00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:42.765
Aww. There's no need to be shy,
I am your future wife after all.

00:09:42.798 --> 00:09:46.639
You've betrayed the Family,
Baby 5! Steel Mill!

00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:48.175
Watch out!

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:53.286
Sai!

00:09:53.319 --> 00:09:54.956
Honey!

00:09:54.989 --> 00:10:01.235
[SAI grunting]

00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:04.341
Good, you're okay!
Let me give you a hand!

00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:07.815
Turn around, geezer!
He's behind you!

00:10:08.951 --> 00:10:12.858
I'll crush you! Charlestone!

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:26.151
[SAI]
That big shrill bastard!

00:10:26.185 --> 00:10:29.592
You're pissing me off!
Cut the crap already!

00:10:29.625 --> 00:10:31.663
Stop going after
all the wounded people!

00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:34.836
I'm over here. Bite Stone!

00:10:34.869 --> 00:10:38.544
One-Sword Style. Demon Horse!

00:10:38.577 --> 00:10:40.747
Y'know, Roronoa Zoro.

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:45.290
There's a very important someone
up on the King's Plateau.

00:10:45.323 --> 00:10:46.926
The King of Dressrosa?

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.564
"Former"!

00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:50.534
[ZORO]
Get to the point, Soprano-Man.

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:53.305
Don't you all seem
a tad bit judgey?

00:10:54.208 --> 00:10:55.143
Wait, what?

00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:58.684
A coup is nothing
strange at all!

00:10:58.717 --> 00:11:01.421
Why blame Doffy for what he did?

00:11:03.527 --> 00:11:05.429
[ZORO]
Quit your yapping.

00:11:09.973 --> 00:11:13.445
[PICA] Aside from the has-been
king and some of his followers,

00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:15.250
I heard the samurai
and God Usopp

00:11:15.283 --> 00:11:18.957
are on the King's Plateau
right now, too!

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.928
So, if I understand correctly,

00:11:20.962 --> 00:11:23.667
suddenly, the whole kingdom
wants to put King Riku

00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:24.803
back on the throne.

00:11:24.836 --> 00:11:26.506
Yeah? What's it to you?

00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:28.142
[PICA]
It pisses me off is what!

00:11:28.176 --> 00:11:31.048
Doffy is the only one
worthy here!

00:11:53.259 --> 00:11:54.294
[ZORO gasps]

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:00.975
What the hell?

00:12:01.008 --> 00:12:02.979
[ROBIN]
What's causing those tremors?

00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:04.414
[KYROS]
Over there!

00:12:33.607 --> 00:12:40.220
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:12:40.253 --> 00:12:41.956
Son of a...

00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:58.389
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:13:11.282 --> 00:13:12.751
[ALL gasp]

00:13:12.785 --> 00:13:15.023
Where's that big
behemoth headed now?

00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:17.528
Wh-What is he gonna do?

00:13:24.007 --> 00:13:28.115
Dressrosa belongs to
the Don Quixote Family!

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.671
[MARINE 718B]
It's gonna walk! Let's go!

00:13:55.705 --> 00:13:59.144
The statue is moving! Run!

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.340
Aw jeez, are you kidding me?

00:14:22.123 --> 00:14:23.928
Is he getting bigger
to you guys?

00:14:23.961 --> 00:14:26.364
Or is headed this way?

00:14:40.493 --> 00:14:45.069
Gutless bastard!
He's trying to kill the king!

00:15:21.776 --> 00:15:28.455
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:30.627
[TOWNSMAN 718C]
Run!

00:15:30.661 --> 00:15:32.631
[TOWNSMAN 718D]
He'll crush us!

00:15:56.779 --> 00:15:59.417
[MARINES scream]

00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:18.422
[MARINE 718C]
Prepare the canons!

00:16:19.391 --> 00:16:21.094
Open fire!

00:16:24.434 --> 00:16:26.505
[MARINE 718C]
Keep it coming!

00:16:34.888 --> 00:16:37.293
[MARINES scream]

00:16:38.963 --> 00:16:41.803
[ZORO] Dammit!
That's why he ditched me

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:44.007
all the way back here!

00:16:45.176 --> 00:16:47.179
[ZORO]
I can't catch up!

00:16:50.352 --> 00:16:52.056
I played right into his hands!

00:16:52.089 --> 00:16:54.628
Gotta think fast of what to do.

00:16:55.965 --> 00:16:57.167
[ZORO]
One quick punch from him

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.206
and it could take out
the entire plateau.

00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:02.210
If I don't think of
some way to shut him down,

00:17:02.243 --> 00:17:05.049
Usopp and that king guy
will be crushed in an instant!

00:17:05.082 --> 00:17:06.318
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE 718E]
Pirate Hunter!

00:17:06.351 --> 00:17:09.625
We won't let you get
any closer to Lord Pica!

00:17:10.694 --> 00:17:12.129
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES groan]

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:16.071
I don't have time
for that crap.

00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:18.408
[ROBIN]
Zoro!

00:17:18.442 --> 00:17:20.847
[KYROS]
He's controlling the statue

00:17:20.881 --> 00:17:23.452
and headed for
the King's Plateau.

00:17:25.056 --> 00:17:28.796
There must be a way
to halt that golem.

00:17:33.405 --> 00:17:34.374
Grandfather!

00:17:34.407 --> 00:17:35.610
Usopp!

00:17:37.715 --> 00:17:41.187
Whoa! Hey, man, screw you!

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:50.707
[ZORO]
Plan 1. Long-distance slash.

00:17:57.955 --> 00:17:59.758
[ZORO] Nah, it'd have to
travel too far,

00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:01.696
and it'd barely nick him.

00:18:03.398 --> 00:18:07.507
[ZORO]
Plan 2. Jump up and get on top!

00:18:23.673 --> 00:18:25.309
[ZORO]
Impossible.

00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:35.129
[ZORO] Plan 3. Shout out,
warning Usopp and the others.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.542
Usopp!

00:18:47.587 --> 00:18:51.494
[ZORO] No chance in hell.
Not with all the noise.

00:18:54.735 --> 00:18:58.175
[ZORO] Plan 4. Call him
by Transponder Snail

00:18:58.208 --> 00:19:00.647
and tell him "hurry up and run."

00:19:09.932 --> 00:19:11.603
[ZORO]
Oh, musta dropped it.

00:19:11.636 --> 00:19:17.346
[USOPP cries]
Don't come any closer!

00:19:23.826 --> 00:19:26.065
Even if I do manage to
get the message out,

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.836
there's not enough time
for 'em to react.

00:19:30.305 --> 00:19:32.811
[MARINES scream]

00:19:36.184 --> 00:19:37.955
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES cheer]

00:19:37.989 --> 00:19:39.257
Smash them for good!

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.461
Give them hell!

00:19:43.065 --> 00:19:45.637
He has his sights on King Riku.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.547
[SAI] It's not our fight, but
this isn't sitting well with me.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.352
[ORLUMBUS]
But can we assist in any way?

00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:54.956
Stop right there!

00:19:54.989 --> 00:19:56.692
Don't do it, stone monster!

00:19:56.725 --> 00:20:00.266
The legendary Sniper King
is on that very plateau!

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:03.105
Yo, rock boy! Ya wanna fight?

00:20:03.139 --> 00:20:06.211
Then I volunteer my body!

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:13.794
[USOPP screams]

00:20:13.827 --> 00:20:16.932
[ALL scream]

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.844
I see now!

00:20:22.878 --> 00:20:25.249
The Pirate Hunter was
a few steps ahead of us.

00:20:25.282 --> 00:20:28.488
Glad I saved my
King Punch as he advised.

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:37.040
I've got your back,
Riku, my friend.

00:20:37.073 --> 00:20:39.477
[ZORO]
Hey! King Punch Guy!

00:20:39.511 --> 00:20:42.551
Excuse me? I'm Elizabello,
the King of Prodence.

00:20:42.584 --> 00:20:45.657
I'd watch your tongue
if I were you!

00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:48.530
[ZORO] I told you, trying to
shatter him won't work.

00:20:48.563 --> 00:20:50.066
Ya gotta hit
his flesh and blood

00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:51.636
or else he'll keep coming back.

00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:54.040
What are you suggesting, then?

00:21:22.296 --> 00:21:25.469
If you want our help,
you better make it quick!

00:21:35.222 --> 00:21:38.863
I'll do anything! Just save me!

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:42.436
[ELIZABELLO]
Pirate Hunter?

00:22:08.088 --> 00:22:09.525
[ELIZABELLO]
Well?

00:22:09.558 --> 00:22:11.829
[ZORO]
Give me two minutes.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.115
[PICA]
King Riku, you there?

00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:43.693
[USOPP screaming]

00:22:43.727 --> 00:22:48.502
[ZORO] Plan 5. Fly in
the sky and chop him up!

00:23:03.399 --> 00:23:05.937
Yep, that's the one.

00:23:14.589 --> 00:23:15.991
[NARRATOR]
Pica, with one goal in mind,

00:23:16.024 --> 00:23:18.295
sends his colossal fist
plummeting towards

00:23:18.328 --> 00:23:19.632
the helpless King Riku.

00:23:19.665 --> 00:23:21.603
Just as the kingdom's
final light of hope

00:23:21.636 --> 00:23:23.105
is about to be extinguished,

00:23:23.138 --> 00:23:26.111
Zoro plunges into action and
diverts the titan's attention.

00:23:26.144 --> 00:23:29.483
The final skirmish between
Zoro and Pica breaks out!

00:23:29.518 --> 00:23:31.187
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.325
"A Decisive Battle in Midair!

00:23:33.359 --> 00:23:36.464
Zoro's New Special
Secret Technique Blasts!"

00:23:36.497 --> 00:23:39.504
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
