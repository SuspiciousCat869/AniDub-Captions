00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.963
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:39.951
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.912
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:48.126
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.628
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.007
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:55.842
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:58.219
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:01.139
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:05.560
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.187
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:10.815
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:15.236
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.532
[NARRATOR] After a series
of fierce battles,

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.409
the Straw Hat Pirates
have reached the waters

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:25.163
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.956
They first land on Punk Hazard,

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:30.001
an island divided into
burning and frozen halves.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.420
After they discover that
the Master of the island,

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:36.090
Caesar Clown, has been
performing terrible experiments,

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.009
they set off to confront him.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.429
Before they got far, Luffy was
approached by Trafalgar Law,

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.765
and the two agreed
to form an alliance.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:46.100
They make a plan to
capture Caesar Clown

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:49.187
and set out separately
for the laboratory.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.194
[NAMI (SANJI)] He won't get his
hands on these children again.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.488
They were drugged and
used as test subjects.

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.740
They've suffered
more than enough.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:04.577
This Master, though.
I'd like to make him suffer.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.581
Hey, you guys, look over there!

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.375
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.335
What in the hell is that thing?

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:14.003
[MARINE AA]
It's headed right for us!

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.922
[MARINE AB]
Is it some kind of missile?

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.758
Nope, it's not a missile.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.811
Go. Cien Fleurs. Wing!

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:33.606
[LUFFY]
Wham!

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.566
[FRANKY]
Yeah!

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:38.027
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.947
All right, come on out,
Master dude!

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.532
Or else we'll
break into your lab

00:04:42.573 --> 00:04:45.368
before we kick your
ass and kidnap you!

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.079
Luffy, that was
supposed to be secret.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.330
Him again!

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:50.540
[gasps]

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:52.583
[CHOPPER]
Go, Luffy, go!

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.252
Damn loud mouth!

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.879
Are you capable of
doing anything quietly?

00:04:56.921 --> 00:05:02.885
[laughing]

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.473
[LUFFY]
"On the Verge of Annihilation!

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.601
A Deadly Monster
Comes Flying In!"

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.202
Hey, guys, did that bastard
just say he's gonna

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.580
kick our master's
ass and kidnap him?

00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:32.081
Yeah, like hell.

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:34.709
Down with the
Straw Hats! Let's go!

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.420
[CENTAURS yelling]

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:38.296
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:44.260
[FRANKY]
Go, Strong... Right!

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:49.474
[CENTAURS screaming]

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:57.815
Well, sir?

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.193
How would you like us
to proceed from here?

00:06:00.234 --> 00:06:04.155
Obviously we capture every
last one of the Straw Hats.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.866
You heard 'im, boys!
Let's go catch us some pirates.

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.327
[MARINES yelling]

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.662
Now. Cien Fleurs!

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.958
[MARINES gasping]

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.918
[ROBIN]
Clutch!

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:19.921
[MARINES groan]

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.307
What now?

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.728
We leave them to it.
Let's get inside.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.939
[CHOPPER] How? Do you
have a key or something?

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.359
Oh, right. The teleportation
thing. I forgot.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.029
[LAW]
Room.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.786
Do you remember
the plan we discussed?

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:54.831
Yeah. You're gonna come up with
some sort of distraction

00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:57.291
to get Caesar and the
bird-lady out of the room,

00:06:57.333 --> 00:07:00.211
then I'll look for
information about the drug.

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.297
[CENTAUR D yells]

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:05.758
[FRANKY]
Weapons Left!

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.760
[CENTAUR D groans]

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:11.472
[CENTAURS gasping]

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:16.227
[MARINE F groaning]

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.438
We're here.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.940
How long do you think we'll
have to wait for the Master?

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:24.110
I doubt he intends to
walk out and greet us.

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.237
Okay. What now?

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.156
Do we look for him
in the laboratory?

00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:29.282
[LUFFY]
Sounds good.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.868
That door over there's
probably the entrance, right?

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:33.536
[ROBIN]
Shall we go?

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.458
[TASHIGI (SMOKER) yells]

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:40.668
I'll get you, Straw Hat!

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.254
Hey! The smoke guy!

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:47.383
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:07.195
[CHILDREN crying]

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:08.696
Hey, let us go!

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:12.283
Gimme candy! Candy!

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.243
[NAMI (SANJI)] They're showing
withdrawal symptoms again.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:15.870
What do we do?

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:19.790
They'll be better off sleeping.
I'll use another one.

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:22.126
Special Attack--Sleep Star!

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:25.546
[CHILDREN yelling]

00:08:30.384 --> 00:08:31.385
[gasps]

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:32.762
[DOLAN grunts]

00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:35.306
Candy!

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.350
[CHILDREN grunting]

00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:40.520
[USOPP] No way! My Sleep Star
didn't work on them?

00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:41.729
What now?

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:43.856
We can't just let them go.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:49.862
[SYND grunting]

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.155
Oh, no!

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:57.912
[SYND grunting]

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:09.757
That was close, but at least
they're sleeping now.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.510
Yeah. It was less effective
this time, though.

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:13.719
[USOPP]
A lot less.

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:16.556
We're in trouble the
next time they wake up.

00:09:23.437 --> 00:09:26.107
Well, Straw Hat Luffy,
tell me this.

00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:27.984
What is your crew doing here?

00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:29.026
Why so mad?

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:31.195
You look better than
I thought you would.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:34.448
Last time I saw you, you were
getting beat up pretty bad.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.908
Stop messing with me.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.285
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:39.829
What's wrong?

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.581
Constipated or something?

00:09:41.622 --> 00:09:44.166
You feeling gassy?

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:45.835
[gasps]

00:09:45.876 --> 00:09:47.837
Ha! Take that!

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.257
[TASHIGI (SMOKER) gasps]

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:57.805
You didn't used to be this weak.
Did something happen to you?

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:00.141
Get off of me! Let go!

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:02.727
Not just weak.
You sound different, too.

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:04.645
Almost like you're
a girl or something.

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:07.231
Hey, Tashigi. Do me a favor.

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.650
Don't get your ass kicked
by an idiot like him

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:12.528
while you're in my body, okay?

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.119
Hey, that weapon.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:24.206
Straw Hat Luffy back at sea,
causing trouble.

00:10:24.248 --> 00:10:28.753
Too bad. I'm here now
to put an end to your fun!

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.504
[SMOKER (TASHIGI) yells]

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:35.092
[SMOKER (TASHIGI) yells]

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:40.848
[SMOKER (TASHIGI) grunts]

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:46.812
[LUFFY]
Crap, I got hit.

00:10:46.854 --> 00:10:48.689
[LUFFY panting]

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:51.233
That thing's tipped
with Sea Prism Stone.

00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:52.610
I remember her.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.945
It's that lady captain
with the glasses.

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:57.865
When'd she get so strong?

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:04.830
[SMOKER (TASHIGI)] Heh.
The name's Smoker, Straw Hat.

00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:07.083
Wha?

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:09.085
Don't you see?

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.920
They're both victims
of Law's little trick.

00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:11.921
Huh?

00:11:11.962 --> 00:11:14.298
Oh. The whole "shuffle" thing?

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.675
Okay.

00:11:15.716 --> 00:11:18.844
That explains
why he was so weak.

00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:21.055
So this girl is...

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:29.730
O-Oh, wow. Nice look,
Smokey! [laughing]

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:32.483
What's so funny,
you little maggot?

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.487
No more dodging. Come fight me!

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.656
Second Gear!

00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:44.662
[SMOKER (TASHIGI)]
Bring it on, Straw Hat.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.831
This should be fun.

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:49.417
[SMOKER (TASHIGI) yells]

00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:52.336
[SMOKER (TASHIGI) yells]

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:56.090
[FRANKY]
And strong... Right!

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:59.969
[CENTAURS gasp, groan]

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:03.848
Am I gonna have to
beat up all of 'em?

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.600
That'll take too long. Huh?

00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:08.227
We know where the door is.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:11.188
Why don't I make us
a little shortcut?

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.817
All right. Let's go!

00:12:18.946 --> 00:12:21.282
[SMOKER (TASHIGI)]
He's moving too fast!

00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:25.745
[SMOKER (TASHIGI)]
Huh?

00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:27.830
We'll finish this
another time, 'kay?

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:29.039
[SMOKER (TASHIGI)]
What?

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:31.333
I'd rather fight you when you
can use all your strength.

00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:32.793
It's more fun that way.

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:36.464
[SMOKER (TASHIGI)] I don't
need charity. We fight now!

00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:39.091
[LUFFY]
Bye, Smokey! See ya!

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:43.012
And go Radical Beam!

00:12:43.053 --> 00:12:46.474
[CENTAURS gasp, scream]

00:12:51.061 --> 00:12:52.438
[CENTAUR J]
He blasted a hole in it!

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.732
How strong are they?

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.025
Was that a laser?

00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:59.904
[laughs] Luffy. Robin.

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:03.783
The lab door's open now.
Let's go in and say hi.

00:13:03.824 --> 00:13:05.159
Woohoo!

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:07.787
Way to use that laser. Yeah!

00:13:07.828 --> 00:13:09.497
[ROBIN chuckles]

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:14.251
[MARINE E] Smokey!
There's something strange

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:15.419
flyin' at us, sir!

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.463
[TASHIGI (SMOKER)]
It's up there!

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.006
What the?

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:30.476
What is that?

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.269
The ship.

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:09.682
[MARINES chattering]

00:14:14.311 --> 00:14:18.440
[MARINES gasping]

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:25.948
[MARINE A gasps]
The ship!

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.908
Stay back for now.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.578
Luffy! Franky! Wait a minute.

00:14:30.619 --> 00:14:31.996
[LUFFY, FRANKY]
Huh?

00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:37.668
What the hell is that?
How is it moving?

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.006
I'll take care of it! [yells]

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:44.091
Have a taste of this!

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.145
What's happening?
It's getting harder to breathe.

00:14:56.186 --> 00:14:58.522
[MARINE L]
Poison gas! Don't inhale it.

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:00.691
[MARINE N] It started
leaking after we cut it open

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.610
and filled it with bullet holes.

00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:04.445
[MARINE M]
We need our gas masks!

00:15:04.486 --> 00:15:06.322
Quick, let's go!

00:15:06.363 --> 00:15:10.200
[MARINES chattering]

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:12.745
Whoa! That looks crazy!

00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:14.580
Is it alive?

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.457
Perhaps it's some
kind of monster.

00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:17.750
It moves on its own.

00:15:17.791 --> 00:15:19.668
[CENTAUR M gasps]

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.546
Tell me, where did
that thing come from?

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.840
I... I have no idea.

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:26.926
I've never seen it before.

00:15:26.967 --> 00:15:29.428
[MARINE B] It just came
falling out of the sky.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.764
[MARINE C] Yeah, and now
it's all over the ship!

00:15:31.805 --> 00:15:34.850
[MARINE D]
Whatever it is, it's disgusting!

00:15:37.686 --> 00:15:39.563
[SMILEY growls]

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:42.524
[MARINE O] It's got eyes. That
means it's some creature, right?

00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:44.193
Hey! Look!

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:49.823
[MARINE O] The blobs are
merging. It's getting bigger!

00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:53.118
[MARINES gasping]

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.162
[MARINES]
What?!

00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:58.916
[MARINE P]
I bet it can't swim.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.584
Let's try pushing it
in the water.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.586
[MARINE Q]
Are you sure that's a good idea?

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.088
[MARINE P]
Huh?

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:11.637
[MARINE P gasps]

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:13.097
It's leaking gas again!

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:14.848
Get him out!

00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:19.061
[MARINE Q, MARINE R]
One, two, three!

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:21.021
Crap.

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:22.064
So, what now?

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:27.236
[MARINE P groans, coughs]
Ow! It's on my skin!

00:16:27.277 --> 00:16:28.612
Somebody get it off!

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.656
Hurry! We need some cloth!

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:33.450
Ya see! I knew we shouldn't
have touched that thing!

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:34.576
[MARINE R]
So what do we do?

00:16:34.618 --> 00:16:36.620
[MARINE Q]
How should I know?

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:38.288
[MARINE S]
I've got this, boys!

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.790
[MARINES]
Huh?

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:42.751
Stay back.

00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:45.421
We haven't seen if it
likes fire yet, have we?

00:16:45.462 --> 00:16:47.297
I say we give it a try!

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:48.799
[MARINES]
Yeah!

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:51.802
Die!

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.346
[MARINE S]
There's nothing in the world

00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:56.849
that's not afraid of fire!

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.684
Good idea. Smart guy!

00:16:58.726 --> 00:17:02.271
Burn the sucker! [laughs]

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:06.358
I'm gonna kill
this slime monster.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.943
Won't be long now!

00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:09.820
[MARINE V] The thing's
gotta be hurting, right?

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.697
[MARINE W]
It's starting to burn!

00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:18.787
Come on and die, you freak show!

00:17:26.253 --> 00:17:27.046
[MARINE R gasps]

00:17:27.087 --> 00:17:28.922
Yeah!

00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:34.344
[MARINE S]
Die, bastard!

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:35.679
[MARINES gasp]

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.694
[MARINES gasping]

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:52.571
[LUFFY gasps]

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:02.581
No, damn you!

00:18:10.964 --> 00:18:13.509
So, anyone know
what that thing is?

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.928
[SUBORDINATE C] Some kind of
slimey blob monster!

00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:17.471
[SUBORDINATE D]
Touch it, it spews poison.

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:19.640
Burn it, it explodes.

00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:23.268
[CHAPPE] Is it dead?
Was it alive in the first place?

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.230
Does it matter?
It's gone now, right?

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.816
Yeah, right. That's good, huh?

00:18:28.857 --> 00:18:30.317
More than good.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.361
That explosion saved
us the trouble of

00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:35.364
going after the Navy bastards
who stole our ship.

00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:37.366
It did us a favor.

00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:38.659
Huh?

00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:45.374
[CENTAURS gasp]

00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:48.210
[FEN BOCK]
It's back!

00:18:49.586 --> 00:18:51.588
There's more! Coming this way!

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.757
[FRANKY] Falling out of
the sky like before.

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.759
[ROBIN]
How many are there?

00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:04.935
So is it, uh, living?

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.436
I have no clue.

00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:07.980
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:10.315
Nor I, and I've seen plenty.

00:19:10.357 --> 00:19:11.900
[BROOK]
This is such a shocking sight,

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:14.236
my eyes might pop
out of my head!

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:19.449
Well, they would,
but I haven't got any.

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:20.993
[chuckles]

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:25.289
Well, whatever it is,
it's strange.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.292
And whatever it's doing
is even stranger.

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:36.091
Wow! It seems to have spit
something high into the sky.

00:19:38.927 --> 00:19:39.887
And look.

00:19:39.928 --> 00:19:42.723
I believe it's headed
this way, quite quickly.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.559
[BROOK, KIN'EMON, SANJI (NAMI)
gasp]

00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:54.776
How vile. It seems
to be pulsing.

00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:57.321
I think I might throw up.

00:20:04.828 --> 00:20:10.834
[ALL gasping]

00:20:12.252 --> 00:20:14.630
Look out. There's one coming!

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:21.678
Run away! Don't let
them touch you!

00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:25.140
Smoker, quick!

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:26.892
It's too dangerous to stay.

00:20:26.934 --> 00:20:29.186
Retreat and find cover.

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:33.106
[chuckles]

00:20:33.148 --> 00:20:35.609
[CAESAR CLOWN laughing]

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:36.568
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.111
[gasps]

00:20:38.153 --> 00:20:39.279
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Good boy!

00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:42.658
I'm sorry I had to keep you
locked up for three years.

00:20:42.699 --> 00:20:45.285
[ALL gasp]

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:46.787
Master!

00:20:46.828 --> 00:20:49.581
You should go, sir.
It isn't safe here now.

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:54.962
[CAESAR CLOWN laughing]

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:01.301
Just like I thought.
It is Caesar Clown.

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:03.428
He's the one behind this.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:04.972
[LUFFY]
Are you the Master?

00:21:05.013 --> 00:21:06.974
That's it! You're goin' down!

00:21:07.015 --> 00:21:10.769
[laughs] Master of Punk Hazard.

00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:13.814
Straw Hat Pirates and
Marines of the Navy G-5,

00:21:13.855 --> 00:21:15.399
welcome to my island.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.027
Allow me to present the most
brilliant scientist ever!

00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:22.322
[laughs]

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:26.076
I am Caesar Clown!

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:29.454
[laughs]

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:34.876
A bit of patience.
It won't be long.

00:21:34.918 --> 00:21:37.629
[SUBORDINATE E gasps, screams]

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:39.631
[CAESAR CLOWN] He doesn't
tolerate water very well,

00:21:39.673 --> 00:21:42.467
you see. So, in order
to cross the lake,

00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:45.762
he has to fling himself
over, piece by piece.

00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:50.225
Inconvenient, perhaps,
but effective nonetheless.

00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:56.315
From a land of blazing fire,
to a land of sparkling ice.

00:21:56.356 --> 00:21:58.692
In a few minutes,
he will be fully reassembled

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:00.944
on this side of the lake.

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:04.990
[CAESAR CLOWN]
And then, boys and girls,

00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:06.908
the show will begin.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:10.203
A recreation of the explosion
from four years ago.

00:22:10.245 --> 00:22:13.040
And you have front row seats.

00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:15.542
Now, prepare for
destruction on a scale

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:18.503
that you've never
witnessed before.

00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:26.219
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Soon, it shall run wild!

00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:29.806
A weapon so powerful that it
kills everything in its path.

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:32.225
Who could possibly
invent such a thing

00:22:32.267 --> 00:22:35.687
but the world's
preeminent scientist?

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:43.653
That's me, the one and only
Caesar Clown, at your service.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:51.203
[laughing]

00:22:51.244 --> 00:22:52.579
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Huh?

00:23:03.924 --> 00:23:06.259
I got you now, Master!

00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:10.639
[CAESAR CLOWN screams]

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:19.272
[NARRATOR] Luffy and the
villainous Caesar Clown

00:23:19.314 --> 00:23:23.527
face each other in battle,
both refusing to budge an inch.

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:24.820
But after the smoke clears,

00:23:24.861 --> 00:23:27.906
the Master of Punk
Hazard is captured.

00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:32.327
Just then, the shocking power of
the Gas Gas Fruit is revealed.

00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:34.121
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.162 --> 00:23:35.414
"An Intense Battle!

00:23:35.455 --> 00:23:38.208
Caesar Exercises
His True Power!"

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.253
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
