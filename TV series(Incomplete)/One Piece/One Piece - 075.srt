1
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:19,219
[GOLD ROGER]
Destiny... Fate... Dreams...

2
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,788
These unstoppable
ideals are held deep

3
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,690
in the heart of man...

4
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:27,293
As long as there are people
who seek freedom in this life,

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,263
these things shall not
vanish from the earth!

6
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,873
<i>People tell me my</i>
<i>head's in the clouds</i>

7
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,374
<i>I don't care what they say</i>

8
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,209
<i>because I'm dreamin' of you</i>

9
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:46,112
<i>You are the treasure I've found</i>

10
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,715
<i>So bright, so bold,</i>
<i>yet so elusive</i>

11
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,418
<i>It's hard to look away,</i>

12
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,454
<i>even though it's blinding me</i>

13
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,122
<i>There are no words to describe</i>

14
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,824
<i>how I feel inside</i>

15
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,428
<i>I'm really really stuck</i>
<i>on you whoa, whoa!</i>

16
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,896
<i>I have to follow my dreams</i>

17
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,497
<i>however crazy they seem</i>

18
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,767
<i>And I won't stop 'til I</i>
<i>get there, you will see</i>

19
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,135
<i>You're all I need</i>

20
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,304
<i>to have the strength to believe</i>

21
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:17,444
<i>Believe in Wonderland!</i>

22
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,581
<i>I'm gonna follow my dreams,</i>

23
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,249
<i>however crazy they seem</i>

24
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,651
<i>I'm gonna share them with you,</i>

25
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,352
<i>a love so true</i>

26
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,756
<i>You're all I want,</i>
<i>together we can move on</i>

27
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,358
<i>Live how we want to!</i>

28
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,793
<i>There is no limit to us,</i>

29
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,462
<i>we have the power of love</i>

30
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,631
<i>And we don't wanna</i>
<i>live ordinary lives</i>

31
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,302
<i>We have the chance</i>
<i>to live in paradise</i>

32
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:48,608
<i>Believe in Wonderland!♪</i>

33
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,122
[LUFFY]
We made it!

34
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,690
So, this is it gang!

35
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:07,026
Our second island
in the Grand Line!

36
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,162
A tiger?!

37
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,130
[roars]

38
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,298
[USOPP] What's up
with this crazy island?!

39
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,542
Collier coup...

40
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,381
[ZORO growls]

41
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,563
[NAMI]
This is Little Garden?

42
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,498
What's little about it?

43
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,571
[NAMI] Seriously!
That guy's not little!

44
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,676
Ahh! Somebody help us!
It's a big dinosaur!!

45
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,180
[VIVI] This place must
be millions of years old!

46
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,216
Somehow this whole island
has been frozen in time.

47
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:06,452
Stuck in the age
of the dinosaurs.

48
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:11,224
I've fought Dorry every day for
more than a hundred years now.

49
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,393
I can't remember why,

50
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,528
but I guess that
doesn't really matter now.

51
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,530
[VIVI]
Why do you keep fighting?

52
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,200
[BROGGY]
For honor!

53
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:27,540
Oh.... Oh boy... He's huge!

54
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,085
[DORRY groans]

55
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,554
[pants]

56
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,124
[DORRY] I now know
that this was a judgment.

57
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,594
A judgment from Elbaf.

58
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,298
[DORRY]
The god of war.

59
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,339
[DORRY] I didn't have
the god's protection...

60
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,740
...and that is all.

61
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,745
[LUFFY]
Who was it?! Who did this?!

62
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,117
These guys messed up
the best duel ever!

63
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,686
They're in some serious trouble,
and they're gonna answer to me!

64
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,855
I'll kill you!

65
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,625
Hah hah! Good luck...

66
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,427
Because it's no use, your
friends are well on their way

67
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,430
to becoming the perfect wax
figures in my collection,

68
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,801
and there isn't anything you can
do about it, Straw Hat Luffy.

69
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,838
[USOPP]
Hold on, Luffy, I'm coming...

70
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,673
[gasps]

71
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,610
[LUFFY sighs]
This really is some nice tea.

72
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,213
Luffy! Hey! Wake up!

73
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,693
[tea pouring into cup]

74
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,562
This is such good teeeeaa...

75
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,365
Luffy!

76
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,304
Why are you sitting there...

77
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,240
...and drinking tea?!

78
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,308
Huh?

79
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,480
Run all you want. It's all over
for you and your friends.

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,183
Here comes my best trick so far!

81
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:20,320
Special Attack: Exploding Star!

82
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,391
[LUFFY]
"Time to Fight Back!

83
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,695
Usopp's Quick Thinking
and Fire Star!"

84
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,399
Huh?

85
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,839
[BOTH scream]

86
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,576
[MISS VALENTINE]
Ahahahaha!

87
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,677
What an idiot!

88
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,547
He missed the target
and hit his friend instead.

89
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,517
Good that was the
last of his bullets.

90
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,757
[MR. 5 chuckles]
Breeze Breath Bomb!

91
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,560
[BOTH scream]

92
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,533
Did I forget to mention that
my breath is also explosive?

93
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,471
[USOPP]
Damn. I can't believe this guy!

94
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,873
He didn't have any
bullets to begin with?!

95
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,743
Hey, Karoo... Are you all right?

96
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:17,710
[KAROO groans]

97
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,813
[coughs] Luffy...!
You snap out of it yet?

98
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,584
[LUFFY]
Yeah. I'm good now, thanks.

99
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,553
[gasps] So he didn't miss!
His plan this whole time

100
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,256
was to burn the Color Trap
on the Straw Hat's shirt.

101
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,724
[pants]

102
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,394
I'm tired of your stupid paints.
You're through...

103
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,999
I'm not gonna let you hurt
any more of my friends...

104
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,902
[growls]
Now, I'm really mad!

105
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,607
This is getting weird.
It's been a long time,

106
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,744
and no one's come back.
I wonder what's going on.

107
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:52,979
This island's crazy.

108
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:56,416
Anything could have happened
to Nami, Vivi, and the others,

109
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,917
which means that
cooking this lizard

110
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,820
may have to wait for a while.

111
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:06,426
Hey, Nami! Vivi!
Can you hear me?

112
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,428
Hey! Beautiful ladies!

113
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,763
If you can hear me,
please just say something!

114
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,998
Hmm?

115
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,507
That's strange. What's this?

116
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,944
[MR. 5 laughs]
Oh, you're mad, are ya?

117
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:28,714
Look at your friends. Being
mad won't do them any good.

118
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,883
Oh, yes, it will!
They're still alive!

119
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,954
[MR. 5 laughs]
Are they, now? Look again...

120
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,023
All they need is some of
Miss Golden Week's paint,

121
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,325
and they'll be
perfect wax statues.

122
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,794
Face it: You're too
late to save them...

123
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,996
They're gone, and you know it!

124
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,299
[growls]

125
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,001
[MR. 3]
Mr. 5 is right about that.

126
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,537
Your friends are finished
because you were too late

127
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,874
to help them, and now,
it's your turn to die.

128
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,985
[MR. 3]
It's time for...

129
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,927
[MR. 3]
...Candle...

130
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,331
...Champion!

131
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,900
[MR. 3 laughs]

132
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,003
[screams]

133
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,671
What the heck is that?

134
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,040
That thing...? That is
what he used one time

135
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,344
to take down someone with a
forty‐two million berry bounty.

136
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,746
That's Mr. 3's most
dangerous work of art.

137
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,048
Time to use your talents,
Miss Golden Week.

138
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,751
I need an extra special
paint job for my armor,

139
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,586
and don't forget to be artistic.

140
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,421
After that, can I take a break?

141
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,457
[MR. 3] Why, yes,
you can go get some tea.

142
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,626
I'd prefer it if you stayed
out of this, actually.

143
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,795
When I'm in this armor,
I'm utterly impervious to harm.

144
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,130
This suit is as hard as iron.

145
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,399
It may be made of wax,
but it fits like a glove,

146
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,701
and it's impossible
for anyone to pierce.

147
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,870
And you don't stand
a chance against it.

148
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,874
[MR. 3]
This artwork is flawless.

149
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,947
Wow...! That's so cool!

150
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,417
Why are you
admiring him?! Fight!

151
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,486
Quaaaaack!

152
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,156
Just a little more
laughter yellow...

153
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,059
Right! Gum‐Gum...

154
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,796
[MISS GOLDEN WEEK]
Paint job complete!

155
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:24,330
And now...

156
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,999
[LUFFY]
...Pistol!

157
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:33,406
...Champion Fight:
Harvest Field Maneuver.

158
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,943
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum...

159
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,446
[LUFFY]
...Stamp!

160
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,918
Hehe! Nice try!

161
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,086
Not good!

162
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,922
Luffy's attacks don't work
against that guy's armor!

163
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,797
[coughs]
The wax is choking me! Huh?

164
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,636
Wax... Huh...

165
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:17,216
[USOPP] Of course...! Why didn't
I realize it before now?

166
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,684
It's all wax,

167
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,454
which means that
it must be able to melt!

168
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,124
[USOPP]
Luffy, we need to use fire!

169
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:28,561
No matter how hard it is,
wax is still wax!

170
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,563
The others only hardened
a few moments ago...!

171
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,232
We should still be
able to save them!

172
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,133
Quack!

173
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,968
No way! Seriously?!

174
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,869
[MISS GOLDEN WEEK]
Yeah, that's correct.

175
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:40,640
Aaaaah! You idiot!
Don't tell them that!

176
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,142
But it doesn't really matter
if you realize that now,

177
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,744
you have no
hope of saving them.

178
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,545
They have thirty
seconds left, at most.

179
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,181
After that, their hearts
will slow to a stop.

180
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,150
As we speak, they're
writhing in silent pain,

181
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,084
barely conscious...

182
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,220
They're hanging onto
their lives by a thread,

183
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,921
terrified of
their impending doom

184
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,990
and unable to move or
even scream for help...!

185
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,928
And they know that you were too
late to save them! Hahahaha!

186
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,599
I'll save 'em right now.
I don't need thirty seconds.

187
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,702
Breeze Breath Bomb!

188
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,005
[USOPP screams]

189
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,108
Usopp! No!

190
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,011
Quaaaack!

191
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,780
When we say you
don't stand a chance,

192
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,881
it's best to believe us.

193
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,015
Ahaha!

194
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,851
[grunts]

195
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,090
[LUFFY] Damn it!
We're running out of time!

196
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,059
[MR. 3]
Just give up.

197
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,203
Listen, I need you to grab
a hold of this rope, Karoo.

198
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,739
[MISS VALENTINE]
Well, this looks like a party.

199
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,708
Now what are
you two planning...?

200
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,876
Do you think I could
join in on the fun?

201
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,716
Karoo, run now.

202
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,284
Get going!

203
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,719
[USOPP] Just run around
all the candle sticks!

204
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,987
And move as quick as you can!

205
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,059
Come on.
I don't know why you bother.

206
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,060
[MISS VALENTINE
'Scuse me.

207
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,128
Ah, jeez.

208
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:13,232
[MISS VALENTINE] Can you
handle my Crescendo Stone?

209
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,936
I wonder just how many kilograms
you'll be able to endure.

210
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,105
[KAROO]
Quaaaaack! Quack!

211
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,339
[MISS VALENTINE]
Ten kilograms.

212
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,007
[USOPP groans]

213
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,509
[MISS VALENTINE]
One hundred kilograms.

214
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,078
[USOPP groans]

215
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,247
[MISS VALENTINE]
Two hundred kilograms.

216
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,782
[USOPP grunts]

217
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,917
[MISS VALENTINE]
Three hundred kilograms.

218
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,186
[groans]

219
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,791
[MR. 5] Damn it!
Hold still, you quacker!

220
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,762
Hahaha! Give it up! It's no use!

221
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,264
Your friends are a permanent
part of my collection now!

222
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,000
Accept it. Hahahahaha!

223
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,935
They're not!

224
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,172
There's no way I'm gonna let
you have my friends, candle boy!

225
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:53,973
I don't have any fire,

226
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,374
so I'm gonna have
to borrow yours.

227
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,776
I hope that's okay!

228
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,311
That hurts! Quit pulling!
Stop it!

229
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,479
Hold on!

230
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,782
That tiny little flame isn't
gonna work quickly enough!

231
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,450
[USOPP]
The rope that Karoo has...

232
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,118
Light that on fire!

233
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,320
A rope? How's that
supposed to help us?

234
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,156
Just trust me on this!

235
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:10,990
[LUFFY]
Huh?

236
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,826
I covered the
whole thing in oil.

237
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,395
[LUFFY] Okay, everyone,
it's time to wake up!

238
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,130
It'll be hot,
but it's the only way,

239
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,799
and they should be all right.

240
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,802
Stop it! Let go! Aaaaaa!

241
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:26,472
[LUFFY roars]

242
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,505
Aaaaah! Ahhh!

243
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,173
Uh, whoops...!

244
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,843
Hope the others don't
get all burned up!

245
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:08,013
[MR. 3] Oh, curse you,
you stupid Straw Hat pirate!

246
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,382
You destroyed
my precious candle set...!

247
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:14,053
How dare you show such disregard
for artistic integrity!

248
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,289
[MR. 3]
You'll pay for this!

249
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,292
No! You're not getting
away with this...

250
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,863
Quaaaaack! Quaaaaack!

251
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:24,797
[MR. 5]
Damn it...

252
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,533
How dare you mock
Baroque Works agents?!

253
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,238
I'm sick and tired of you
and your friends! Got that?

254
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,041
Okay, playtime
is really over now!

255
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,576
I'm going to break
that scrawny little neck

256
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,212
of yours into a million pieces!

257
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,413
Ten Thousand...

258
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:45,217
...Kilogram Guillotine!

259
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,988
Not good!

260
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,597
[NAMI]
That was really hot!

261
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,233
Couldn't you have
thought up another plan?

262
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,939
You're being a little
picky here, don't you think?

263
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,308
Aren't you at least
a little bit grateful...?

264
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,510
You have a point there. Thanks.

265
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,413
It's amazing! I can't
believe we're actually alive!

266
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:18,317
Got out of the wax, did ya?
Well, I've had enough...

267
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,088
We simply cannot afford for you
to screw up our mission anymore.

268
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,324
[USOPP]
Hey, Mr. 5!

269
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:29,194
Special Attack...
Exploding Star!

270
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,329
You fool!
Haven't you figured out

271
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,165
that your pathetic explosives
don't affect me at all?

272
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,200
They're nothing to
an exploding man!

273
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,303
You took the bait!

274
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,376
I'm sorry.
I just told a little lie.

275
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,145
That wasn't an Exploding Star...

276
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,948
That was a Special Tabasco Star.

277
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,951
[MR. 5]
Spicy!

278
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,189
Hahahahahaha!

279
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:00,659
I had to learn how effective
that thing was the hard way!

280
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,994
[MR. 5 grunts]

281
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,963
Damn, you stupid pirate!

282
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,631
[coughs]

283
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,334
I refuse to let you
make a mockery of me!

284
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,201
[USOPP gasps]

285
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,503
[MR. 5]
Time for a full body explosion!

286
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,706
There'll be nothing
left of you.

287
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,341
[USOPP]
Ow... Ow, let go of me!

288
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,643
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Please let go!

289
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,644
Let him go!

290
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,646
I'm too young to die...
I'm too young to die...

291
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,581
Ahhh! Let go!

292
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,490
[ZORO]
Flaming Oni Giri...

293
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,225
[MR. 5]
Huh?

294
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,159
Oh!

295
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,160
[ZORO grunts]

296
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,197
[MR. 5 screams]

297
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,717
[ZORO] You know these
flaming swords aren't too bad.

298
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,089
[NAMI]
Zoro!

299
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,361
[BROGGY grunts]

300
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,803
Hey, there. Glad to see
you made it out alive.

301
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,472
Heh. Yeah.

302
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,386
Master?

303
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:41,727
So now it seems...
two foes are left.

304
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,500
[LUFFY]
Bird guy! Lets go!

305
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,069
[KAROO]
Quack! Quack!

306
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,075
Real men don't interfere
with someone else's fight!

307
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,448
[MR. 3 laughs]

308
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,116
[LUFFY]
Huh?

309
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:09,188
[MR. 3] So good of you to come,
I've been expecting you...

310
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,824
Welcome to my Wax‐Wax Manor.

311
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,425
[LUFFY]
What's going on?

312
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,195
[MR. 3] Why, just a little game
of hide and seek...

313
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,097
Can you figure out
which one is me?

314
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,466
[laughs]

315
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,035
I'd say it appears you picked
the wrong group of people

316
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,436
to go up against.

317
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,772
You're no match for
my intellectual prowess

318
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:27,940
and artistic abilities.

319
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:31,276
You're just another buffoon
who acts on blind instinct

320
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,279
and uses brute force to
solve all his problems.

321
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,516
You can't hope to catch an
intellectual giant like me!

322
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,385
[laughs]

323
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,122
I am a Baroque Works agent.

324
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:47,192
Every assignment that is given
to me I see through to its end.

325
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:50,229
So if you think you're ready,
then just step forward.

326
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:57,069
[laughs]

327
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,638
That's right;
just take a little step.

328
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,474
And as soon as
your back is turned,

329
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,343
I'm going to stab you...

330
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,346
[laughs]

331
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,748
...right through that
pathetically noble

332
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,416
little heart of yours.

333
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,652
[laughs]

334
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:33,372

335
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,606

Ahh!

[grunts]

337
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,381
[MR. 3]
How could you have known...

338
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,717
...that... this...
is where I was...?

339
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,253
[groans]

340
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,692
Instinct.

341
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,864
Quack!

342
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,735
Quaaack!

343
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:06,638

344
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,575

[sniffs]

347
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:37,569
[SANJI] Earl Grey is a perfect
addition to the afternoon.

348
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,339
Aaah! Hold on!
What am I doing...?!

349
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,507
I shouldn't be sitting here
all relaxed just casually

350
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,977
sipping tea without a
single care in the world!

351
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,512
Nami, Vivi, and the others
could be waiting out there

352
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,616
right now for me
to come and help them!

353
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,318
I am still curious about
one thing, though...

354
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,320
What is a nice,
relaxing place like this

355
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,357
doing smack in the middle
of an ancient, creepy jungle?

356
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,360
[SNAIL ringing]

357
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,495
Huh?

358
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:08,667
[SNAIL ringing]

359
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,835
[SANJI]
What?

360
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,011
Hmm?

361
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,213
A transponder snail.

362
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,351
Yeah, hello...

363
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,387
You've reached the crap café...

364
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,888
Can I take your order...?

365
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:39,798
You can quit fooling
around now, jackass.

366
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:40,799
Now then...

367
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:44,236
Your report's a little bit late,
don't you think?

368
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,406
[SANJI]
Huh...? My report, you say?

369
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:51,576
And to whom exactly
am I speaking, please?

370
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,911
Me.

371
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,415
Mr. 0.

372
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,983

Hmm...

"Farewell, Giant Island!
Head for Alabasta!"
