00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:06.297
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:39.576
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:42.537
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:47.792
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.336
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:53.590
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.425
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.844
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.471
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.641
[NARRATOR]
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.853
a boy whose body became rubber
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:10.690
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:14.569
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.824
[NARRATOR] After a series
of fierce battles,

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.659
the Straw Hat Pirates
have reached the waters

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.496
of the New World, ruled by
the Four Emperors.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.207
Their first stop is Punk Hazard,

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:30.210
an island divided into
burning and frozen halves.

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.795
There, they learn of terrifying
experiments performed

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.173
by the master of the island,
Caesar Clown.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.508
Their struggles against the mad
scientist cause them to form

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.594
an alliance with Trafalgar Law,

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.930
one of the Seven
Warlords of the Sea.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.098
Do you remember the
plan we discussed?

00:03:44.098 --> 00:03:46.351
Yeah. You're gonna
come up with some sort of

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:49.520
distraction to get Caesar and
the bird-lady out of the room.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.357
Then I'll look for
information about the drug.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.775
[NARRATOR]
With the island in chaos,

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:57.153
Luffy prepares to face
off with Caesar himself.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:00.949
[CAESAR CLOWN] And then, boys
and girls, the show will begin.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.160
A recreation of the explosion
from four years ago.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:06.704
And you have front row seats.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.082
Now. Prepare for
destruction on a scale

00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:11.542
that you've never
witnessed before.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.503
Soon, it shall run wild!

00:04:13.544 --> 00:04:17.090
A weapon so powerful, that it
kills everything in its path.

00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:19.425
Who could possibly
invent such a thing

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:22.303
but the world's
preeminent scientist?

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:28.810
That's me, the one and
only Caesar Clown,

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.603
at your service.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.818
[groans]

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:39.112
Got you now, Master!

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:44.909
[LUFFY]
"An Intense Battle!

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:48.121
Caesar Exercises
His True Power!"

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:57.422
[BROOK] That creature.
It's a slime, isn't it?

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:58.631
[SANJI (NAMI)]
A what?

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.425
[BROOK] I thought that slimes
were limited to the realm

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.385
of fantasy,
but apparently not.

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:04.053
I read a book about a slime,

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.139
and it looked just
like that one.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.890
There's nothing
else it could be.

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.350
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Huh.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.102
[BROOK] The book was
quite fascinating.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.520
I couldn't put it down.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.940
This slime, you see, loved to
attack beautiful women.

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.608
Its body fluids were harmless,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.986
but they had a knack
for melting clothes.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:23.990
[BROOK chuckles]
Naughty!

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:24.991
[BROOK shrieks]

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:25.867
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Whoa.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.494
That monster is
pretty messed up, huh?

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:31.039
Uh, by the way, can I
borrow that book?

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.040
Could I borrow it, too?

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.292
Would you shut up? Just look.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.336
[ALL chuckling]

00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:37.670
[ZORO]
If that thing touches you,

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:40.673
it's gonna do a lot worse
than just melt your clothes.

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.967
The fish are dying from
the little pieces of itself

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.802
that dropped in the lake.

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.556
[ZORO]
The thing's made of poison.

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:52.477
It only takes a drop to kill and
it looks like it's spreading.

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.603
It's poison?

00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:56.773
Wait, but the samurai's
torso is in that lake.

00:05:56.814 --> 00:06:01.235
[KIN'EMON gasps]

00:06:03.237 --> 00:06:05.990
[gasps]

00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:11.120
[gasps] Surely not!
You're diving in? Sanji!

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:15.875
I brought him with us,
so I can't let him die here.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:20.880
I may be a woman right now,
but it's time to man up!

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.673
I'm proud of you.

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:25.718
Handle the ones behind you.
I won't be too long.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.762
[BROOK]
Huh? Behind me?

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:31.974
[BROOK yelps]
A veritable bevy of mini slimes!

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:33.643
When did they get here?

00:06:33.684 --> 00:06:35.603
Nami. I'm sorry.

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:38.606
But still, I'm the strongest
swimmer on the crew.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.817
I swear. I'll be done
before anything happens

00:06:40.858 --> 00:06:42.610
to your gorgeous body!

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:47.323
[BROOK]
Careful! Good luck down there!

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:48.866
[KIN'EMON] He dove into
that poisonous water

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:52.703
without a second thought.
I'm unworthy of such kindness.

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:57.834
[SANJI (NAMI)] This is even
colder than it looks!

00:06:57.875 --> 00:06:59.710
I better make this quick.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.882
[BROOK] They, ah, seem to
be coming right for us.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.385
[ZORO] Yeah, what are
we gonna do about it?

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.053
[BROOK]
Excellent question.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:12.432
[whimpers]

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.232
[LAW]
Monet's alone.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.154
[LAW]
This is my chance.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.114
[MONET]
Sorry, the Master's not here.

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:30.283
[LAW]
Yeah? Where'd he go?

00:07:30.324 --> 00:07:32.201
[MONET] Probably
outside to watch the fight.

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:35.413
That degenerate can't get
enough death and destruction.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.918
That's all right,
I don't need him.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.505
I think I'll be taking off soon.
I've seen everything.

00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:46.591
I'm through with this place.

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:49.844
Shame. It'll be lonely
without you.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.763
[LAW] I could use your help
with something first, though.

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:57.768
Could I borrow you for a sec?

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.189
[MONET] What is this?
A date? Lucky me!

00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:07.862
[MONET chuckles] A man of
few words, are we? Where to?

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.155
[LAW]
You'll see.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:12.033
All right. I was bored, anyway.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:19.499
[CHOPPER] That must be the bird
lady Usopp was talking about.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:27.965
[CAESAR CLOWN yelps]

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:30.968
[CENTAUR AA]
S-Straw Hat caught the Master!

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.845
Way to go, Luffy!

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.764
Little punk! How dare you?

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:36.140
Crazy kid!

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.684
[CAESAR CLOWN grunts]
Let go, you fool!

00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:39.936
Nuh-uh!

00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:43.731
So that's haki. Caesar has
Logia powers, right?

00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:46.484
But Luffy can still grab him,
even though he's made of gas.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.986
[CENTAUR B] Back off,
Straw Hat! We'll shoot!

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:49.654
[CENTAURS gasp]

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.614
Hurry! Take him out, quick!

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:55.618
If you jerks wanna pick a fight,
then pick one with me!

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.702
And Clutch!

00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:57.745
[MEN groan]

00:08:57.745 --> 00:08:58.996
Outta my way!

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.373
[CENTAURS shout]

00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:02.500
[FRANKY]
Heh! Luffy's got this one!

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.544
Caesar can't use his power!

00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:07.088
Not exactly.
I wouldn't celebrate.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:07.838
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.507
With Armament Haki,

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:15.137
Luffy is able to touch Caesar,
even though he has Logia powers.

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:18.766
However, unlike ocean water
or sea prism stone,

00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:22.228
it doesn't actually weaken
the person that he touches.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.940
We don't know the full extent
of the Gas-Gas Fruit's power.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.900
This is only the beginning.

00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:53.467
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Don't get cocky, you brat!

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:56.429
Armament Hardening!

00:09:57.763 --> 00:10:00.141
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.475
...Bell!

00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:03.728
[growls]
Gas Robe!

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.024
[gasps]

00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:09.609
[MARINE A gasps]
No!

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.320
Dammit! One more time!

00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:17.283
What's going on here?
I can't get away!

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:20.536
Luffy! Hold your breath!
That's poison gas!

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:23.998
[gasps]

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:26.042
Ah crap, that's deadly.

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:28.669
[LUFFY grunts]

00:10:28.669 --> 00:10:31.339
Nice try, but you
can't escape me!

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:34.759
Once the Gas Robe has you in its
poisonous clutches, it's over!

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.677
You can't hold your
breath forever!

00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:39.221
[LUFFY grunts]

00:10:39.263 --> 00:10:41.766
Just suck it up and
die already, would you?

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:43.559
[grunting]

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:46.103
[CAESAR CLOWN]
I promise it'll be fun!

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:47.563
For me.

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:48.356
Luffy!

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.607
Dammit!

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.525
[CAESAR CLOWN] I've performed
countless experiments,

00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:53.778
and I can assure you that
my gas will subject you

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:56.739
to only the most
exquisite of suffering!

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:58.783
[grunting continues]

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:01.160
Please, give it a try!

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:05.539
[grunting continues]

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:07.583
Oh, I can't wait to see this.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.710
[grunts]

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:13.214
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Heh?

00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:16.926
I think he's lost his mind!

00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:20.471
No joke! He's done for!
He's sucking up all of it!

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:24.433
He's screwed now!

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:25.601
I'm afraid to watch!

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:28.187
You're dead meat, kid!
I hope you're proud of yourself!

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.398
[grunting]

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.233
Suffer! Die!

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:40.074
[CENTAURS]
What...? What?!

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:47.123
[gasps]

00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:48.457
[coughs]

00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:52.420
Neat. I guess poison doesn't
bother me too much anymore.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.380
[LUFFY]
Probably 'cause of Magellan.

00:11:56.924 --> 00:12:01.011
Magellan? The prison guard
with the paramythia powers?

00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:03.973
My poison's potency
makes his look puny!

00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:05.933
[LUFFY]
Now, Gum-Gum...

00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.520
...Jet Mace!

00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:12.606
[CAESAR CLOWN growns]

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.987
[CENTAURS]
Master!

00:12:18.028 --> 00:12:19.071
[grunts]

00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:20.281
Hell, yeah!

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:23.284
How dare you! We won't let you
lay another finger on him!

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:24.034
Kill 'im dead!

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:25.703
Come on everyone, attack!

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.246
[CENTAURS]
Yeah!

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:32.293
[CAESAR CLOWN] Mind your
own business, you maggots!

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:33.461
[CENTAUR P]
Master?

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:41.719
[CAESAR CLOWN breathes deeply]

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:44.889
He didn't just call
us maggots, did he?

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.724
We must have heard him wrong.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:51.771
[CAESAR CLOWN breathes deeply]

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:56.233
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Swallow my poison, will you?

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:59.236
You shouldn't mock
my Gas-Gas powers!

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:01.572
I'll put you in your place!

00:13:04.992 --> 00:13:07.828
Armament Hardening!

00:13:07.828 --> 00:13:09.789
Gum-Gum...!

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:10.664
Let's go!

00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:12.917
[LUFFY]
...Gatling!

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.503
And Gastanet!

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:19.298
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:13:22.259 --> 00:13:27.264
[ALL grunting]

00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:32.645

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.482
[LUFFY grunts]

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:37.900
[BOTH]
Luffy!

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.777
All right, Master!

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:43.113
[CAESAR CLOWN] I think we've
had enough fun for today.

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:46.075
Wake up, my Smilies! Wake up!

00:13:46.116 --> 00:13:48.369
Smilies? Huh?

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:54.416
[CENTAURS, MARINES]
Huh?

00:13:54.458 --> 00:13:56.919
They're moving!
How did he do that?

00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:02.299
Very good! Now give
Straw Hat a big hug! Go!

00:14:07.054 --> 00:14:10.099
They can follow orders?
I thought they were just goop!

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.769
[LUFFY grunts]

00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:17.398
Luffy! Run away!
Those slime guys blow up!

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:20.067
[LUFFY grunts]

00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:20.901
Luffy!

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:25.239
It's time to say goodbye!
Gastanet!

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:36.250
[ALL shouting]

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:40.421
Luffy!

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:50.514
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:24.757

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:29.303
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:31.472
He's done! Too easy!

00:15:32.556 --> 00:15:34.391
You ain't nothing but
a pile of ash, now!

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.894
I'd like to see you try
and swallow up that one!

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.146
[CENTAUR BB] That's what he
gets for comin' to our island!

00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:42.942
If we can't beat ya, then the
Master's got our back!

00:15:42.983 --> 00:15:46.445
What happened? He's gone.

00:15:46.487 --> 00:15:49.281
[gasps]
That can't be right.

00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:51.909
I have the finely-tuned
mind of a genius!

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:54.745
I would never lose to some
muscle-headed lout!

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.122
You have to respect science,
Straw Hat,

00:15:57.164 --> 00:15:58.999
or this is what you get!

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:04.004
[CENTAURS] Master! Master!
Master! Master...!

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.888
Praise me more,
my underlings! Yes!

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.935
[laughs]

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:22.564
[LUFFY]
Wow, that was close, huh?

00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:23.816
[CAESAR CLOWN]
What?

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:29.863
[LUFFY grunts]

00:16:30.864 --> 00:16:33.033
[chuckles]

00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:34.159
[CAESAR CLOWN]
What?

00:16:34.201 --> 00:16:35.828
[CENTAURS]
What?

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.207
[LUFFY]
All right.

00:16:43.627 --> 00:16:45.546
Gum-Gum Jet Stamp!

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:46.797
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Huh?

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:48.632
[CAESAR CLOWN groans]

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:55.472
[CENTAURS]
No! Master!

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.310
[LUFFY] Those slimy
dudes blow up like crazy!

00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:03.605
Look at that! Getting us
all worked up over nothing!

00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:05.524
Luffy's got this in the bag!

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:06.692
I hope so.

00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:08.402
Damn! That kid's tough!

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:10.946
Just let him handle this!

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:13.282
Round two!

00:17:13.323 --> 00:17:14.658
You gotta fight us, too!

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.744
If that's what you want, sure!

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:18.996
[CENTAURS grunting]

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:24.752
[LUFFY grunts] Okay! I got
you for real this time!

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:26.462
[CENTAURS]
Master!

00:17:26.503 --> 00:17:30.632
Robin! Franky! Is there
anything here I can put him in?

00:17:30.674 --> 00:17:32.718
He's got Logia powers,
so we can't tie him up.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.304
So like a barrel or something?

00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:37.222
Whoa, whoa! Not so fast!

00:17:37.264 --> 00:17:40.267
The Navy is taking him
into custody, so step back!

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:43.312
You might as well turn
yourself in while you're at it!

00:17:43.353 --> 00:17:45.564
[MARINE I]
Hands up, pirate scum!

00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:48.859
So what now? Do we fight
the Straw Hats, or not?

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:51.111
Dammit. What a mess.

00:17:51.111 --> 00:17:52.404
Smoker, wait!

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.281
Looks like we got
a fight comin' up!

00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:57.076
Follow Smokey and
the Captain! Let's go!

00:17:57.117 --> 00:17:58.202
[MARINES]
Yeah!

00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:01.038
[MARINE F] Hope you're
ready for a beatdown, pirate!

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.124

[LUFFY gasping]

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:32.653
[gasps]
What's wrong?

00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:37.658
[LUFFY gasping]

00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:05.644
[CAESAR CLOWN]
You shouldn't underestimate me.

00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:09.356
Ha!

00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:14.361
[gasping continues]

00:19:28.542 --> 00:19:29.626
Luffy!

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:31.378
Oh, no!

00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:36.383
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:41.180
[FRANKY] Okay. I'll do my best
to distract the gas man.

00:19:41.221 --> 00:19:43.515
You grab Luffy and
get him out of there!

00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:46.685
Be careful! We don't need
you to get poisoned too!

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:49.188
[FRANKY]
Punks! You get outta my way!

00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:51.481
Don't you touch him!

00:19:51.523 --> 00:19:54.985
[FRANKY] You're about
to eat a Strong... right!

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.445
[CENTAURS yell]

00:19:56.486 --> 00:19:58.906
[FRANKY]
And you're next!

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:03.660
[FRANKY]
Franky Radical... Beam!

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.206
[ROBIN]
Wing!

00:20:07.247 --> 00:20:08.415
I'm here.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:13.003
[ROBIN gasps, coughs]

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:16.423
What the hell?

00:20:16.423 --> 00:20:18.217
[MARINE E]
She just passed out!

00:20:18.258 --> 00:20:20.177
I don't like the look of this.

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:22.888
Let me handle things.
Everyone here, step back!

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:23.639
[MARINES]
Right!

[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:44.618
[FRANKY] What happened?
Are you okay?

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:46.411
Robin, say somethin'!

00:20:46.453 --> 00:20:48.830
