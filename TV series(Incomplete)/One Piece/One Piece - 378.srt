00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040

28

All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730

37
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,241
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,077
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:45,248
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:50,253
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,464
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,135
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,220
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,807
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,810
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,272
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,632
[LUFFY]
"The Promise from a Distant Day!

49

[HOGBACK]
All right, shut the gates.

50
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,391
[ABSALOM] This doesn't feel
right leaving Perona behind.

51
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,601
[HOGBACK]
We searched the whole island,

52
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,353
what else are we supposed to do?

53
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,771
[ABSALOM]
It's just strange.

54
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,856
Where the hell
did she disappear to?

55
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,817
[HOGBACK] Okay,
I think we're in the clear.

56
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,320
Drop the invisibility cloak.

57
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,371
Fasfasfasfasfasfas!

58
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,332
[HOGBACK]
A perfect escape! Fas!

59
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,875
[ABSALOM]
We really cut it close.

60
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,503
I was sweating some
invisible sweat there.

61
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,922
I'd still just like to know
why Kuma the Tyrant appeared

62
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,882
out of the blue
on Thriller Bark.

63
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,176
I can fill you in on that one.

64
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,845
Well, apparently Kuma
was sent to inform Moria

65
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,473
of who'd been chosen
to succeed Crocodile.

66
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,475
So there's a new Warlord?

67
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,311
Yes. And he's quite
the controversial figure.

68
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,189
His name's Teach,
but he goes by Blackbeard.

69
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,567
From what I hear,
he's a nasty piece of work.

70
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,694
Take a look.

71
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,863
Second Division Commander
of the Whitebeard Pirates.

72
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,448
Fire Fist Ace.

73
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,368
Now awaiting execution
at the prison, Impel Down?

74
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,536
[HOGBACK]
Ace is easily

75
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,538
the most famous
henchman Whitebeard's got

76
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,664
working under him.

77
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,542
A fine gift for Teach
to present to the Government.

78
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,418
[ABSALOM]
True.

79
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,252
[HOGBACK]
There's a feeling out there

80
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,212
that this could
spell very bad news

81
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,214
for our Great Pirate Era.

82
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,758
The tides are turning
toward a maelstrom.

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,343
There couldn't be a worse time

84
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,804
for Moria to be
flat on his back.

85
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,348
I can see where you're
going with this, Doctor.

86
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,600
But I only care about one thing.

87
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,227
I want a nice wife.

88
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,230
Sure. Find me a corpse
that seems like your type.

89
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,690
I don't want a zombie!

90
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,652
I want a living woman
filled with blood and passion!

91
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,780
[USOPP] I can't believe
everyone passed out

92
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,241
in the courtyard and slept
through the whole day.

93
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,200
[FRANKY]
Are ya surprised?

94
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,494
We did fight for a
solid twenty-four hours.

95
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,496
[LUFFY]
I'm starving to death, Sanji!

96
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,415
[SANJI]
Then eat some more cheese!

97
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,752
I need more than cheese!

98
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,880
I'm a man, I have to have meat!

99
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:39,839
[SANJI]
Then help me bring

100
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,467
my cooking supplies
over to the courtyard.

101
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,260
Our grateful group
of survivors don't wanna

102

budge an inch from that place,

103
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,722
so we'll just
make the meal there.

104
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,723
Hope you don't mind.

105
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,892
We haven't felt the sun
on our skin in years,

106
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,560
so we're trying to soak it up.

107
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,646
My men are so relieved,
they're weeping with joy.

108
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,274
[USOPP] How can you
have this much energy?

109
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,942
It's weird. Really weird.

110
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,278
Are you certain that
you've got enough food?

111
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,614
[SANJI] We got back all the
food that was stolen from us.

112
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,784
On top of that, someone stocked
our stores with Moria's food.

113
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,452
I wonder who'd do such a thing.

114
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,662
Well, whoever they are,
they've got a kind heart.

food wasn't enough,

have to hunt for treasure--

costume jewelry.

even cross our minds

slipped outta my mouth.

in such terrible
condition before.

175
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,551
He was teetering
on the edge of death.

176
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,552
It's bizarre.

177
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,763
Something happened
while we were passed out.

178
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,474
He was injured before,
but not like this.

179
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,436
[ROBIN]
It is strange.

180
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,438
And it's even stranger
that Kuma the Tyrant

181
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,606
would just up and leave.

182
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,941
And speaking of strange stuff,

183
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,901
why's Luffy so energetic?

184
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,569
[LUFFY] Yeah,
I don't get it, either,

185
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,112
but it's fine with me!

186
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,699
[RISKY BROTHER BROWN HAIR]
Ya wanna know what happened?

187
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,117
Then look no further!

188
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,495
We saw the whole thing
from start to finish!

189
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,038
Every damn detail!

190
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,874
And we can lay it out
like you were there!

191
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,000
[SANJI]
C'mere.

192
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,460
[RISKY BROTHER BROWN HAIR]
Hey, what's the big idea?

193
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,337
Sanji?

194
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,093
[RISKY BROTHER BROWN HAIR]
What gives?

195
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,262
The guy saved
your life, too, y'know.

196
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,055
[RISKY BROTHER MASK] Yeah, you
were tryin' to take his place,

197
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,306
but he knocked you out!

198
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,184
[SANJI]
Shut up. What did you two see?

199
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,937
Just hurry the hell up
and tell me what happened.

200
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,605
Well, after I
blacked out, I mean.

201
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,940
I know the first part.

202
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,941
--Huh?
--Huh?

203
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,247
[RISKY BROTHER BROWN HAIR]
That Warlord's power

204
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,499
was even crazier
than what you saw.

205
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,209
[RISKY BROTHER MASK]
He laid his paws on Straw Hat

206
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,003
and made this bubble
come out of him.

207
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,256
He said he'd extracted all
the damage done to his body.

208
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,800
Wait, he did what?

209
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,303
[RISKY BROTHER MASK] So he took
that big ball of suffering.

210
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,596
And then...

211
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,347
[KUMA] If you truly
wish to take his place,

212
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,393
then you must accept and
inflict his agony upon yourself.

213
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,478
As close to death
as you are already,

214
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,981
not only will it
undoubtedly kill you,

215
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,150
it will do so painfully.

216
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,152
Why don't you have a taste?

217
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,247
[RISKY BROTHER MASK] Just
the tiniest bit of that stuff

218
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,167
had the swordsman screamin'
like he was being murdered.

219
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,293
But that didn't stop him

220
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,504
from takin' on every ounce
of that big ball of pain.

221
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,256
[RISKY BROTHER BROWN HAIR]
It moved me to tears, man!

222
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,967
[RISKY BROTHER MASK]
Yeah! Same here, I was bawling!

223
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:35,843
I see.

224
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,137
That explains
why Luffy's just fine

225
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,181
and Zoro's damn near comatose.

226
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,016
Reckless moron.

227
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,439
Where the hell'd all
this blood come from?

228
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,941
Hey! Are you still alive?

229
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,526
Where'd that paw guy go?

230
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,112
What in the hell happened here?

231
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,158
What happened here?

232
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,035
Nothing at all.

233
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,375
Well c'mon!

234
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,709
Now that ya know,
let's go spread the tale

235
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,169
of how brave your friend is!

236
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,087
Damn straight!

237
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,588
Everybody's gotta hear this!

238
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,048
[SANJI]
Hold it.

239
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,675
You're keepin'
your mouths shut.

240
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:19,303
Zoro didn't do this
for Luffy's gratitude.

241
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,179
And besides,

242
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,014
how do you think
it would make Luffy feel

243
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,267
if he found out Zoro is
suffering from his pain?

244
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,648
Don't say a word or
I'll kick the crap out of you!

245
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,400
All right, you convinced me.

246
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,568
Yeah, you're absolutely right!

247
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,029
Everyone's still alive, right?

248
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,280
That's all that matters.

249
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,157
Now. Let's go eat.

250
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,953
Holy crap!

251
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,289
These Straw Hat
guys are so cool.

252
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,541
[RISKY BROTHER MASK]
With a crew like that,

253
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,085
their captain is
one lucky dude.

254
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,091
And now I know.

255
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,264
[LUFFY] Hey, you two,
where'd ya go?

256
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,142
Didn't you guys say you had
somethin' you wanted to tell us?

257
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,601
So what happened?

258
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,442
Why's it mean so much to ya?

259
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,235
Everyone's still alive.

260
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,320
That's all that matters.

261
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,196
[RISKY BROTHER BROWN HAIR]
Man.

262
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,282
I wanna tell 'em so bad!

263
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,450
[RISKY BROTHER MASK]
Right?

264
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,702
How're we supposed to sit
on such an amazing story?

265
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,495
What the heck?

00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,499

[RISKY BROTHER BROWN HAIR]
Man!

00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,133
This is the most delicious
thing I've ever tasted!

269
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,136
[RISKY BROTHER MASK]
It's been years, entire years,

270
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,721

happy to be alive!

00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,608
To indulge in
such delicacies again!

277
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,193
Why, my taste buds are leaping--

278
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,278
they're dancing
in unrestrained joy!

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,656
Oh my! But I don't
have taste buds, do I?

00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,201

shut up and eat already?

on such mouthwatering
meals two days in a row,

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,174
I'm starting to worry
I've gained some weight!

You're nothin' but bones!

288
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,844

This skeleton's the best!

[ROLLING PIRATE 378J] How's a
skeleton able to talk, anyway?

I don't know, but I like 'im!

I've ever seen!

you move without any muscles?

They haven't even
opened up the booze yet

and everyone's
already lost their minds.

307
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,376
[CHOPPER] It's as loud
as a battlefield in here

308
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,378
and he's sleeping
right through it.

[NAMI]
That's about normal.

310
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,590

It's gonna help him!

Zoro loves booze, it's
gonna make him feel better!

317
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,957
He needs medicine,
not booze!

00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,293
[LUFFY] How 'bout meat?
That's like a medicine.

00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,711
No, not quite.

Yoho!

You're pretty talented.

Um... You mind talking
about what happened out there?

by the two of you.

By your bravery.
And your compassion.

Friendship is a beautiful thing.

00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,972
You shouldn't put me
in the same boat with Zoro.

stupid in comparison.
