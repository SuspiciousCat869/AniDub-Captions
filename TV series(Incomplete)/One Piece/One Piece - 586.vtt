00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.738
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.774
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.477
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.712
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.881
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.717
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:19.986
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.955
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:25.425
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:30.463
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:39.826
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.662
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:47.901
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.470
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.673
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:55.575
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:58.011
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:00.580
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:05.385
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:06.886
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.723
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:14.928
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:19.699
[NARRATOR] After a fierce battle
at the bottom of the sea,

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:22.168
the Straw Hat Pirates depart
for the deadly waters

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:25.838
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:29.175
Receiving a distress call,
the crew lands on Punk Hazard,

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.744
an island split into two
sections with extremely

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:32.946
different climates:

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.415
the Burning Lands
and the Ice Lands.

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:38.418
You're done! Bon voyage!

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.721
[yells]

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.593
You and I both know bullcrap.

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.895
Now I wanna see
what's inside that lab.

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:51.431
[LAW]
I don't see anybody else around.

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:55.602
And if Straw Hat does show up,
I'll behead him for ya.

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:58.504
If there's nothing else,
get lost.

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:00.974
[gasps]

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:06.012
[CHILDREN yelling]

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.948
We're free now!

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:11.651
[ALL]
One, two, three!

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:15.722
Super!

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:18.157
It's the Straw Hats
and children?

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:22.795
We're out of the building!
We're gonna be okay!

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:24.897
[SANJI gasps]
Why's he here?

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:28.234
Smoker! I'd recognize
that ugly mug anywhere!

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:31.070
And Tashigi! Lookin' good!

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.340
Wait a sec!
The Navy's here too?

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:36.442
Change of plan, kids,
we can't get out this way!

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:37.343
Look for another exit!

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:38.845
[CHILDREN shouts]

00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:41.581
What would bring the Navy
to a place like this?

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.516
Beats me! Let's just go!

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:47.954
There should be a back door!
Try to find it! Go on, hurry!

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:49.689
[TASHIGI gasps]
Marines!

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:51.691
Track down the
Straw Hat Pirates!

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.693
[LAW]
Room.

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:55.828
And, Takt!

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:58.364
[MARINES gasp]

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:01.534
Oh no!

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:07.573
[MARINES shouting]

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:17.850
[LUFFY]
"In a Real Pinch!

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:21.020
Luffy Sinks into
the Ice-Cold Lake!"

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:35.234
Heh! Now fire!

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.044
[USOPP screams]

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:51.184
Aim right for the
bottom of their vessel!

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:52.985
Come on, let's turn back!

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.855
Like I would ever
do that, Usopp!

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:56.989
[USOPP warbles]

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.658
Go forward!

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:02.995
Oh, I'm sorry, did you not
notice the nonstop gunfire?

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.330
[LUFFY gasps]

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:08.501
I told you, we're this close
to sinking to a watery death!

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:13.005
[laughs] You'll never escape
the wrath of Brownbeard,

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.107
you fools!

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.009
Huh? The wrath of who, now?

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.778
[growls]

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:20.847
[BROWNBEARD]
Don't play dumb with me!

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.382
I'm the former pirate
with a bounty

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:24.584
of over 80 million berries!

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:29.389
Ah! The mighty Brownbeard!

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:32.859
Did you hear that? Brownbeard!

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:38.865
B-R-O-W-N-B-E-A-R-D!
Make no mistake, boy!

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:42.802

00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:45.605
[ZORO yawns]

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:50.743
I've never heard of ya!

00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:57.717
[BROWNBEARD] Huh? Do I really
make that weak of an impression?

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.751
[CENTAUR A gasps]

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:01.087
[grunts]

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.490
Fair enough! But you
won't forget this!

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:09.061
[USOPP, LUFFY yell]

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.797
No way! He got us!

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.598
We're falling!

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:13.800
[grunts]

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:15.701
[gasps]
This is bad!

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.672
Ha! That oughta teach ya!

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:21.908
Real nice shot there, Boss!

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.110
[CENTAUR B]
They're dead meat now!

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:28.147
[laughs]

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:31.584
It serves you right!
Struggling won't help you.

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:34.821
Soon you'll all freeze
and sink like rocks!

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:48.768
[USOPP shouts]
So cold! It's over.

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.837
We're gonna be the snowcones!

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.638
[ROBIN gasps]

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:55.641
[ZORO pants]

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:56.976
This blows.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:59.812
Man, I'm really tired now.

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:02.315
[USOPP]
This is all your fault, Luffy!

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:04.016
We coulda gotten away!

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.019
But no, you just had to
keep on pushing his buttons,

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:08.154
didn't you?

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:12.258
[USOPP] Oh, doh!
I cad eeben tahk dow.

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:17.430
I'm sorry. Oh well. I guess they
won't join the crew after all.

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:19.665
Now! Finish them off!

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:20.433
[ZORO gasps]

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:22.335
[BROWNBEARD]
Prepare to fire!

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:27.507
Now here's what we'll do.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.508
[USOPP gasps]

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.843
You stay and keep
them from drowning.

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:33.713
I'll get slicing. Be right back.

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:37.817
B-B-Bake it quick.
I duddo how log I--

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.453
[ZORO]
It'll just take a sec--

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:41.988
[ZORO gasps]

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.123
Zoro! Are you okay?

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:45.525
[gasps]

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:51.364
[USOPP yells]

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:54.534
Hey! Why are there
sharks in a lake?

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:56.369
[laughs]

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:59.572
It's simple! That's not
a lake, it's a sea!

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:03.142
The battle between Akainu
and Aokiji was so explosive,

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:05.578
it left a massive crater.

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.548
Water from the sea poured in
through cracks in the island

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:11.183
and made what you see here.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:14.320
It brought plenty of
sea life along with it!

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:17.690
[BROWNBEARD laughs]

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:22.662
[USOPP gasps]
No! Don't get eaten, Zoro!

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:25.197
Also, hurry! I'm cold!

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:30.603
Aim and fire! There's nowhere
they can go, now!

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:33.239
Hate to say it, but he's right!

00:09:33.272 --> 00:09:35.508
Send them straight to hell!

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:37.577
After all the crazy crap
I've lived through,

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.246
this is the thing
that's gonna kill me?

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:41.614
[chuckles]

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:45.451
[groans]

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:47.386
Now meet your maker!

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.487
[yelps]

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:51.591
[BROWNBEARD]
Fire!

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:54.560
[CENTAURS groan]

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:55.628
Huh?

00:09:55.661 --> 00:09:57.897
[groaning continues]

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:02.068
My soldiers! What just
happened to them?

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:04.604
[gasps]

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:06.238
I think I know!

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.109
[BROWNBEARD]
Huh?

00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:15.181
[BROOK] Colder than a blizzard.
The wind from the underworld.

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:18.951
[BROOK]
Cuts like an icy blade.

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:22.822
[growls]
Damn you! What is this?

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:26.225
[BROOK laughs]

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:29.328
[BROOK] By the way, I just
froze your gun barrels.

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:31.864
So I would advise
against shooting.

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:36.168
Unless you want them
to explode, that is.

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:39.672
Who the hell are you?
And why the skeleton disguise?

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:42.141
[BROOK]
My name is of no consequence.

00:10:42.174 --> 00:10:43.075
It's Brook.

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:44.777
Make up your mind.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.313
I died once and
became a skeleton.

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:49.482
And now that I live again...

00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:53.052
...my second life is devoted
to the Straw Hat Crew!

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:58.324
You can call me the Soul King!

00:10:58.357 --> 00:11:02.862
[CENTAUR H grunts] I don't know
how you froze our guns,

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:04.630
but... you'll pay!

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:07.366
[BROOK] Pay? And how do
you plan to make me?

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.436
[CENTAURS grunting]

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:11.270
[CENTAUR I]
Bastard!

00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:12.638
[CENTAUR J]
That's it!

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:16.976
I've lost enough
friends in my time!

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:19.478
So, I say...

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.813
...snow way!

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:22.982
[CENTAURS shout]

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:27.353
What the hell?
He's so fast, it's scary!

00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:31.190
[grunts] So there was
one more, was there?

00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:33.492
Well, what difference
does it make now?

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:37.196
I'm sure the others have already
been devoured by the sharks!

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:41.901
See? You were too late!

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:44.470
H-Huh?!

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:47.306
They beat up the sharks?

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:51.377
What? Where did those
wretched pirates go?

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:56.148
[LUFFY pants]
Right here!

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:57.416
[BROWNBEARD]
Huh?

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.086
[ROBIN] This is a
pleasant surprise, Brook.

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:03.989
[laughs]
It's so good to see you all!

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:06.425
Who knew running from
that terrifying ghost

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:09.729
would lead me directly
to where you were?

00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:12.331
[ZORO]
Centaurs, dragons, sharks.

00:12:12.364 --> 00:12:14.567
I don't care what this
island throws at us.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.769
You shoulda run while
you had the chance,

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:19.271
'cause you sure as
hell can't stop us!

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:20.740
[BROWNBEARD]
Huh?!

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:25.778
[ZORO shivers]
But this damn weather.

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:29.181
That's another thing.
I can't cut that with my sword.

00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:32.184
[LUFFY] It's freezing!
I can barely walk!

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:34.520
I told you guys,
don't you remember?

00:12:34.553 --> 00:12:38.224
"We can't just go to the cold
side like this," I said, but no!

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:42.361
Hey, look over there.
If you ask me, we got lucky.

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:43.562
[shivers]

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.698
[ROBIN] Running into
them was the best thing

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:47.233
that could have happened.

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:49.969
They're close! Let's open fire!

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:53.939
[BROWNBEARD] Huh? Hold on.
I think I've seen them before.

00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:54.907
[CENTAURS]
Huh?

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.942
[ZORO]
Good thinking, Robin.

00:12:56.976 --> 00:13:00.780
I call the fourth guy
from the right.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:05.084
Yeah, nice one. I'll take
the guy next to him.

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:07.386
All right now, let me see.

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:10.256
The girl on the far
left will do nicely.

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:12.291
Huh? I'm confused.

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:15.060
[ZORO laughs]

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:16.629
[ROBIN laughs]

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:18.731
[LUFFY laughs]

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:20.232
[CENTAURS]
Huh?

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:22.568
[ALL]
Those coats look nice and warm!

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:27.239
[USOPP] All right, good idea,
but please get me one too!

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:28.908
[CENTAUR L gasps]
Uh-oh.

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:31.243
They're not gonna take
our clothes, are they?

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:33.779
[CENTAURS] No way!
Then we'll freeze to death!

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.014
[BROWNBEARD]
Huh?

00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:39.418
I remember now. That straw hat!

00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:41.086
[CENTAURS chattering]

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.089
[BROWNBEARD gasps]

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:46.358
[BROWNBEARD]
Yes, from two years ago!

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:48.594
That kid from the
Worst Generation!

00:13:48.627 --> 00:13:49.628
[CENTAURS gasp]

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:53.966
There's no doubt!
That's Fire Fist's brother!

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.868
[CENTAURS gasp]

00:13:55.901 --> 00:14:01.140
The pirate, Straw Hat Luffy.
With a 400 million bounty!

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:02.274
[laughs]

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:05.110
[CENTAURS]
What? He's gonna kill us all!

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:08.280
[CENTAURS yell]

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:10.850
Mil Fleurs, go!

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:12.218
[CENTAURS]
Huh?

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:14.453
Huh? What in the
world's happening?

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:17.323
[gasps, yells]

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:20.359
[CENTAURS shouting]

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:23.195
[LUFFY] Gimme your clothes,
animal people!

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:24.830
[CENTAURS yell]

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:29.568
[ZORO] You freaks aren't gonna
make this difficult, are you?

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:33.339
I'd rather not have to
hurt you too badly.

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:35.908
[CENTAURS shout]

00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:37.343
[BROOK]
Would you look at that?

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:40.412
I suppose you didn't need my
help as much as I thought.

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:45.451
[gasps]

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:52.224
[BROWNBEARD]
Please don't hurt me!

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:22.588
[MARINES gasp]

00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:34.500
[MARINE A] I told you, sir,
that guy's bad news!

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:36.068
We should've just retreated!

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:38.337
[MARINE B]
What are we gonna do now?

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:41.106
Tsk!

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.708
[grunts]

00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:45.311
[LAW]
Hmph!

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:59.491
[CHOPPER] Come on, kids,
let's karate chop our way out!

00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:01.026
Wa-ta!

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.695
[SANJI]
Where's that back door?

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:04.163
--[KIN'EMON] Halt your retreat!
--[SANJI] Huh?

00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:07.099
We mustn't go! That fellow
back there was the one

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:08.801
who cut my body into three!

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:10.602
No way, seriously?

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:13.505
So, do you think he might
still have the rest of you?

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:16.675
On hand? I highly
doubt he would!

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:18.644
Okay, then it can wait!

00:16:18.677 --> 00:16:19.678
[KIN'EMON]
Take me back!

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:22.114
Perhaps I can obtain
some information!

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:23.949
[SANJI] The only relevant
information right now

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.018
is that we need to
run the hell away!

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:29.855
[grunts]

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:35.728
[NAMI] I'm not seeing
that exit anywhere!

00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:37.563
Any ideas, you guys?

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:42.001
[FRANKY] Yeah! Just leave
everything to super Franky here!

00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:45.738
[FRANKY laughs]

00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:49.208
[CHOPPER] Oh, do you have some
kinda super-cool sensor thing?

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:50.309
Oh no, I got nothin'.

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:53.078
[CHOPPER, SANJI] Then why are
we following you, huh?

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.185
That was the samurai.

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:01.920
[CHOPPER]
Hurry, hurry!

00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:07.993
[LAW] And the Straw Hats.
I'm not letting them get away.

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.361
Room!

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:13.165
[ALL gasp]

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:16.602
Hey, did you guys just see that?
The air's all murky.

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:22.274
[ALL gasp]

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:24.276
All right, Shambles!

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:38.791
[ALL gasping with
different voices]

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.897
[SANJI (NAMI)] Whoa, I just
felt something weird.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.232
Agh, no time to think
about it right now!

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:50.402
Keep moving, rugrats!
The exit can't be far!

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:53.405
What the...? Where the
hell'd my cigarette go?

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:56.942
[CHOPPER (SANJI)] Wa-ta!
Ha, ha! I feel like kicking!

00:17:58.343 --> 00:18:00.112
Where'd this come from?

00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:02.881
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Hey. This is serious, Sanji.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.016
Quit playing!

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:05.551
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)] We're super
close to bustin' our way

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:07.052
outta here, I can feel it!

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:09.755
Good thing I got these
turbo-powered tank treads to--

00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:11.557
[gasps]
Crap.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.624
Uhm, guys?

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:14.460
You're acting really weird.

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:15.994
What happened? Are you sick?

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:18.797
Huh? Actually.

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:21.667
Why does my chest
feel so breezy?

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:30.609
[shouts]
I'm manly!

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:35.447
Hey, check it out, guys!
These things are huge!

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:38.617
Wait a second, what?
I'm a human now?

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.652
And I just went
from super cyborg

00:18:40.686 --> 00:18:43.956
to raccoon in no time flat!

00:18:43.989 --> 00:18:49.294
O-Okay. Just calm down!
I know! Let's do roll call!

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:50.095
Chopper!

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:51.163
Here!

00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:52.097
Franky?

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:53.098
'Sup!

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:55.367
Eh. Sanji?

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.936
[SANJI gasps]

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.638
I mean, yes?

00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:02.274
That means you're... Nami?

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:03.308
[NAMI]
Mm-hm!

00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:04.643
[SANJI gasps]

00:19:04.676 --> 00:19:07.980
[CREW]
Why did we switch bodies?!

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:16.188
[MARINES gasp]

00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:17.656
[MARINES shout]

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:22.161
Look bastard. I've had enough.

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:24.796
Give the ship back.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.864
[LAW]
Eh, fine.

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:26.999
[MARINES]
For real?

00:19:27.032 --> 00:19:29.201
[LAW] But let me make
just one adjustment.

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:31.003
[MARINES gasp]
Huh?

00:19:31.036 --> 00:19:32.237
[gasps]

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.717
[MARINES shouting]

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:50.589
[MARINE A]
It'll crush us!

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:52.491
[MARINE R]
Run away!

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:57.529
[shouting continues]

00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:15.113
[MARINE B]
Let's retreat, Admiral!

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:17.416
That ability is
way too powerful!

00:20:17.449 --> 00:20:19.918
[MARINE Q] Yeah, and that
guy really creeps me out!

00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:23.789
I don't think so. None of
you are going anywhere.

00:20:23.822 --> 00:20:25.557
[gasps]

00:20:33.565 --> 00:20:36.134
He turned our ship
into abstract art!

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:38.704
It's a wreck! We can't
take that out to sea!

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:39.838
[MARINE C]
I know!

00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:43.709
We're stuck on this crappy
island with that lunatic!

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:44.810
[sighs]

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:47.045
You work for the
Government too, bud!

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:50.949
And just now, you broke
contract by causing us trouble!

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:52.217
Yeah, cut it out, Law!

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:53.819
Wait till we tell HQ!

00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:56.021
[MARINE G]
You're gonna lose your title!

00:20:57.189 --> 00:21:00.459
See how much I care.

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:02.828
Now Scan!

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:05.430
[MARINE H]
What's that do? Oh no!

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:11.970
[MARINE D]
Huh? Transponder Snails?

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:13.605
[MARINE E]
Wait, I lost mine!

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:15.907
[MARINE F]
Whoa, so did I!

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.410
Hey, you stole them, didn't you?

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:20.912
Give those back!
What do you need 'em for, huh?

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:23.815
[LAW] I can't let you reveal
what you've seen on this island.

00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:27.286
This way, the Government
never has to hear about it.

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:28.854
[MARINES]
Huh?

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:38.730
Warlord or not, you've pushed
your luck too far now!

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:43.969
[MARINES shouting, chattering]

00:21:44.002 --> 00:21:47.773
The Op-Op Fruit, huh?
Let's see what it's made of!

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:49.007
[gasps]

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:53.812
Don't let him cut you, men!
Just stay away!

00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:55.047
[MARINES]
Huh?

00:21:57.049 --> 00:22:02.754
[MARINE K]
He got me! Huh? What the...?

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:06.725
I don't need you here!
Get outside of the circle!

00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:08.627
Wait, what circle?

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.862
Look, as long as you're
in this vicinity,

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:13.865
you're like a patient
on an operating table!

00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:15.634
Law is the Surgeon of Death.

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:19.738
He can control anything within
his operating room at will!

00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:21.373
He'll end you!

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:26.645
[TASHIGI]
Tsk! Trafalgar Law!

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:28.747
You've left me no choice!

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.149
[SMOKER]
Stop, Tashigi! You can't win!

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:32.884
Your Haki's too weak!

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:36.254
[TASHIGI shouts]

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:51.069
[TASHIGI breathes deeply]

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:58.143
[heavy breathing continues]

00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:03.248
[MARINES]
No, it can't be!

00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:19.197
[NARRATOR] Tashigi has
been cut into pieces

00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:22.768
and the powerful soldiers of the
G-5 are about to be wiped out.

00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:26.204
Just then, Smoker
confronts Trafalgar Law.

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:30.108
A fierce battle between warlord
and navy vice admiral begins

00:23:30.142 --> 00:23:33.745
However, after their fighting
lays waste to the entire area,

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:36.715
the situation takes an
unexpected turn.

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:38.383
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:41.987
"A Collision!
Law Vs. Vice Admiral Smoker!"

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.256
I'm going to be
King of the Pirates!
