1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,700
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:41,369
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:44,272
in search of the One Piece,
the legendary treasure

40
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:47,509
left behind by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,311
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:52,180
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,116
sets sail to become the next
King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:57,719
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,785 --> 00:02:59,454
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:01,489
of the World Government,
which will use

47
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:04,192
any means necessary
to stop them.

48
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:07,729
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

49
00:03:07,795 --> 00:03:11,165
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

50
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,369
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

51
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,138
the crew will cut a path
across the Grand Line

52
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:18,673
to the New World!

53
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,344
[NARRATOR]
The Straw Hat Pirates were led

54
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:26,514
to an uncharted island
while chasing a giant beetle

55
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:29,484
Luffy insisted on
recruiting to the team.

56
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:30,718
[LUFFY grunts]

57
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,854
Alright, big guy.
You're gonna join--

58
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:34,656
[LUFFY yelps]

59
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:36,324
[YOKO]
Boss is with me!

60
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:37,392
Huh?

61
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:41,496
[YOKO] And he'd rather
die than become a pirate!

62
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:42,697
[YOKO grunting]

63
00:03:43,898 --> 00:03:46,501
[NARRATOR] The beetle was
in fact, the guardian of Yoko,

64
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:49,170
a young girl who hates pirates.

65
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:52,373
She was a member of a
strange community known as...

66
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:53,942
...Kansorn Island.

67
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:55,910
Home away from home
for expatriates

68
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,412
of the East Blue ocean!

69
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,782
[FABRE] We like to call
it Little East Blue!

70
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,686
[NARRATOR] Unbeknownst to
the islanders, a vicious group

71
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,722
known as the Amigo Pirates
are headed their way.

72
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:10,758
Under the orders of the
dreaded pirate Shiki.

73
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:15,697
[LUFFY] A Special Presentation
Related to the Movie:

74
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,633
Little East Blue in Danger!

75
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,247
I better keep it at a
slow and safe speed.

76
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:38,386
They've got an absurd
amount of reefs out here.

77
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:39,654
[NAMI FAN A]
Ready, go!

78
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:42,423
[NAMI FANS]
We love you, Nami!

79
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:43,324
[NAMI]
Huh?

80
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,960
[NAMI FANS]
Over here! Right this way!

81
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,663
A welcome party? I guess?

82
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:54,302
Guys, it's really her!

83
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,738
We're in the presence
of the real-life Nami!

84
00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:59,807
And she's even cuter
than her wanted poster!

85
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,277
I can't stop the tears!
I'm so happy to be alive!

86
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:04,312
Yeah! Yeah!

87
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,614
[NAMI] Well, this is weird.
Who are you guys?

88
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:08,750
Wow, you actually
care enough to ask!

89
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:11,019
We're the founders of the
unofficial Nami fan club.

90
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:14,589
[NAMI FANS] Otherwise known
as the Orenami Group!

91
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:15,757
You're my fan club?

92
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:17,258
We, L...

93
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,459

[NAMI FAN C]

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,361
[NAMI FAN D]
E!

96
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:24,465
[NAMI FANS]
You! You're the best, Nami!

97
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:26,601
Stop it, you're grossing me out!

98
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:31,005
[NAMI FANS groaning]

99
00:05:32,106 --> 00:05:33,608
[NAMI]
Look, I need to see Luffy,

100
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:34,876
can you just take me to him?

101
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:37,712
[NAMI FANS] Of course!
Anything you want, Nami!

102
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:41,015
[NAMI sighs]
What an obnoxious day.

103
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,618
[NAMI] And quit sucking up
to me already. It's not working.

104
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:45,687
[NAMI FANS]
Your wish is our command!

105
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,890
[LUFFY laughs]
Aw man, this is so much fun!

106
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:51,325
You guys should try this!

107
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,528
Well, I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself.

108
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,897
[FABRE chuckles]

109
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,799
I'm sure this is
nostalgic for you,

110
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,567
since you came
from Fusha Village.

111
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:00,735
Uh-huh!

112
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:03,471
But all our windmills were
small compared to this one.

113
00:06:03,504 --> 00:06:06,474
[FABRE laughs] We sort of
consider that windmill

114
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:09,010
the official landmark of
Little East Blue, so we had to

115
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:11,979
--make it impressive.
--[LUFFY] Woo-hoo!

116
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:14,816
[TANKTOP GUY] See? Just like
the dojo you grew up in.

117
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:16,651
[ZORO]
Huh.

118
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,057
Hm?

119
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:32,400
[KUINA grunting]

120
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,703
[KUINA panting]

121
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:40,942
Kuina. Fight me
with a real sword.

122
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:44,912
Real sword? You're on.

123

[YOUNG ZORO yelps]

126
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:56,057
[KUINA grunts]

127
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:01,729
[YOUNG ZORO panting]

128
00:07:01,763 --> 00:07:04,599
[KUINA panting]
And that makes,

129
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,568
2,000 wins for me.

130
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:12,940
[ZORO]
Oh, man. Bad memories.

131
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,877
[MENDO]
Alright, kids, break's over.

132
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,712
Time for your afternoon lessons.

133
00:07:17,745 --> 00:07:19,480
[DOJO KIDS]
Okay.

134
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:26,154

[MENDO gasps]

136
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,456
[ZORO]
Hm?

137
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:31,959
[MENDO whimpering]
No, no, no!

138
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,728
He wants to fight us!

139
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:36,164
[DOJO KIDS gasp]

140
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,166
Hey, calm down.
There's no need to worry.

141
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:39,734
He didn't come here
to challenge you.

142
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:41,068
Don't you guys recognize him?

143
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:43,404
This is the
"Pirate Hunter" Zoro!

144
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:46,407
[DOJO KIDS]
What? That's so cool!

145
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:50,411
Huh?

146
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:56,517
[MENDO]
Can I have your autograph?

147
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:00,988
[YOKO]
That's just pathetic.

148
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:12,166
Ooh! It's identical to
the mansion Kaya lived in!

149
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,635
Wow, this really takes me back.

150
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:18,639
She would always pop her head
out of the upstairs window.

151
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:19,941
Hey, Usopp!

152
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:22,176
Oh, hiya, Kaya!

153
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:25,446
Did I keep you waiting?

154
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,648
[KAYA laughs]
What adventure are you

155
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:29,116
gonna tell me about today?

156
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,118
Yeah, let me think
of a good one.

157
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:33,788
Have I told you about the time
I fought a giant goldfish

158
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:36,123
at the South Pole when
I was five years old?

159
00:08:36,157 --> 00:08:37,658
A giant goldfish?

160
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:39,627
[USOPP]
Yeah, as big as you can imagine!

161
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,030
Even its poop was practically
its own landmass!

162
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,832
It was so big that
when I landed on it,

163
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:47,001
I thought it was
some kind of island.

164
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:50,872
[KAYA laughs]

165
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,674
Man, it would be
so great to see her!

166
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,743
[USOPP]
Whoa, what the?

167
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,578
It's a fake!

168
00:08:57,645 --> 00:09:00,147
[laughs]
Well that was the popular style

169
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:01,983
on Syrup Island,
isn't that right?

170
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:03,818
Luigia apparently
modeled this mansion

171
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:04,986
after the one she lived in.

172
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:06,153
You call this "style"?

173
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:08,823
Who in their right mind would
build something like this?

174
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:10,658
Whoa, hold on.

175
00:09:10,658 --> 00:09:13,995
If she lived in that mansion,
she might be related to Kaya.

176
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:20,167
[USOPP gulps]

177
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:29,844
It can't be.

178
00:09:29,877 --> 00:09:31,746
Is-Is that Kaya?

179
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:42,039
[USOPP] Con-ping! Con-ping!
Con-ping! Con-ping! Tilt!

180
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,017
[MITSUBOSHI] You're a member
of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew,

181
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,952
is that right?

182
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,855
Yeah. I'm the cook for the ship.

183
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:07,423
[MITSUBOSHI]
Where did you learn to cook?

184
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:10,893
[SANJI] I spent most of my
youth on the original Baratie.

185
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:14,196
[MITSUBOSHI yelps] You've got
to be messing with me!

186
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,031
Are you serious?

187
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,932
You really grew up
on the Baratie?

188
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:17,600
[SANJI]
Yeah.

189
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,235
I guess you could say that.

190
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:20,636
But that's just incredible!

191
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,371
I'm thrilled to have you here!

192
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,940
Zeff's cooking is one of the
greatest joys of my life!

193
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:27,443
I was actually a regular
there when it first opened

194
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:30,546
and I've even tried to replicate
his recipes for my own dishes.

195
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:32,615
I see you're really into this.

196
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:34,450
[MITSUBOSHI] The building
is similar too, right?

197
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:36,886
I don't exactly have
Zeff's seafaring courage.

198
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:40,122
So, I figured it'd be best
for me to stick it out on land.

199
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:42,224
But I wanted to match the feel.

200
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:43,426
Capture the style.

201
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:45,561
Well, go on, why don't
you give it a taste?

202
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,097
I'd love to, but I don't
actually have any money.

203
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,066
[MITSUBOSHI]
Don't worry. Dig in!

204
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,002
Well if you're sure. Alright.

205
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,909
[SANJI]
Whoa. Is this--?

206
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,631
[YOUNG SANJI gasps]

207
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,687
[YOUNG SANJI gasps]

208
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,160
[YOUNG SANJI giggling]
Yes!

209
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:54,130
I figured out the damn
geezer's recipe!

210
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,168
Okay, what do you think?

211
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:02,505
You are the expert.
Does it taste like Zeff's?

212
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:09,412
It does. It's actually
better than Zeff's.

213
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,014
Do you really mean that?

214
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:15,317
You've just made me
the happiest man alive!

215
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,488
[YOKO] Even the cook's
falling for their crap.

216
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,591
[USOPP gasping]

217
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,365
[USOPP whimpers]

218
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:30,332
Wow, you're small.

219
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:33,269
Yeah, and you got a
big mouth! I know you.

220
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,371
You're from
Syrup Village, aren't you?

221
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:36,739
Yeah. I am.

222
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,675
[LUIGIA] I figured.
You're clearly Yasopp's son.

223
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,210
[USOPP]
You mean you know my dad?

224
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:42,511
To an extent.

225
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,514
Well, I knew his constant lies
more than I really knew the man.

226
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:47,616
You did know him. Wait a sec!

227
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,618
Then did you actually
live in Kaya's mansion

228
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,287
in Syrup Village like they said?

229
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,188
[LUIGIA]
Hm?

230
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:53,022
[USOPP groans]

231
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:54,457
Look, don't act like
you don't know

232
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,458
what that mansion means.

233
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,060
It was held up as the
glory of our village.

234
00:12:58,093 --> 00:12:59,528
Everyone dreamed
of living there!

235
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,563
[USOPP]
Uh. Yeah.

236
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:03,098
[LUIGIA] I spent my whole
miserable life dreaming

237
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:06,235
that I might one day live in a
mansion as grand as that one.

238
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:08,804
And I was finally able to
bring my wish to fruition

239
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,640
when I settled on
this little island.

240
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:15,110
That means, you're not
related to Kaya.

241
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:18,247
They treat me like I'm
royalty here and I like it.

242
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,549
And you'll keep my secret
unless you'd rather die.

243
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,652
Right!

244
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:27,389
Oh no! Not the granny too!

245
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:29,658
[NAMI FAN D]
Oh, careful!

246
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,594
Make sure to watch
your step in here!

247
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,662
[NAMI] Kind of a creepy
path you're taking me on.

248
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,232
[NAMI FAN D]
It's really more of a labyrinth.

249
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:37,800
[NAMI]
Huh.

250
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,301
[NAMI FAN A]
It opens up onto

251
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:40,636
all different
parts of the island.

252
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:42,271
[NAMI]
Yeah, that's real neat and all.

253
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:43,405
But how much longer?

254
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,641
[NAMI FAN C]
Oh! We're almost there!

255
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:54,116
[NAMI screams] What-What-What
in the hell is that?

256
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,318
That's the official
symbol of our fan club!

257
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:58,254
We only had a poster
for reference.

258
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,089
But it's still a pretty
good likeness, huh?

259
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:02,258
I'm not bothered by
the level of craftsmanship,

260
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,526
but why is it naked?

261
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,761
Oh, that was decided
by popular vote.

262
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,296
We felt that was most honest.

263
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:09,598
But we did have to use our
imagination on the front.

264
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:11,767
[NAMI FANS laughing]

265
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:14,303
[NAMI FANS groan]

266
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:15,804
[NAMI] You're gonna put
a shirt on that thing.

267
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:17,840
[NAMI FANS]
Okay.

268
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,444
[BOSS groans]

269
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,786
I don't get it. They're so dumb.

270
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,389
You and my father always
protected this island.

271
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,659
And now they let pirates on it.

272
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:39,795
I hate those jerks.
I hate them.

273
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,699
[BOSS groans]

274
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:55,244
[YOKO laughing]

275
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,645
Stop it, Boss, that tickles!

276
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:04,028
[YOKO laughing]
Enough okay!

277
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:56,580
Alright, boys, look alive.

278
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:58,382
We've got us a job to do here.

279
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,884
Who knows what kind of
conditions we might face.

280
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,420
But we're gonna make Shiki
proud and join his team!

281
00:16:03,454 --> 00:16:05,522
We've just got to nab
the giant beetle

282
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:07,925
that fled from Shiki's hideout.

283
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,028
Failure is not an option,
so be ready for anything.

284
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:12,129
Comprende?

285
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:14,531
[AMIGO PIRATES]
Yeah!

286
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:18,569
Heh, heh. Didn't mean to
steal your thunder, big bro.

287
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,472
You are the captain, why don't
you say some rousing words?

288
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:22,373
[LARGO snores]

289
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:23,307
[COLT yells]

290
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:25,142
[AMIGO PIRATES yell]

291
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:27,578
[AMIGO PIRATE 427A] Oh, no,
he's in the middle of a siesta!

292
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,947
[AMIGO PIRATE 427B]
He's gonna be out for a while!

293
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:32,483
[COLT]
Bastardo!

294
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:34,251
[AMIGO PIRATE 427C]
Don't do it, vice captain!

295
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,487
Please, you know how dangerous
it is to wake him up

296
00:16:36,553 --> 00:16:38,322
when he's in the
middle of a siesta!

297
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:41,058
Exactly! That is not
how I want to die!

298
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:43,260
Comprende, but this is
kind of a crappy time

299
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,295
to take a gato nap!

300
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,066
Might be tough without him,
but we got no choice.

301
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:50,567
You wanna give me a battle cry?

302
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:52,936
[AMIGO PIRATES]
Ole!

303
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,608
And it's done.

304
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,977
Now we're set for
transporting one big beetle.

305
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,512
[BROOK]
Simply remarkable.

306
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:03,614
Why, it scarcely took
you a minute to finish!

307
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,583
[FRANKY] I'm not embarrassed
to acknowledge my talents.

308
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,918
And that's one of 'em.

309
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:09,119
It looks great.

310
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,421
We might've had a rocky start,

311
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:12,489
but I bet we'll be
beetle buds in no time!

312
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:13,624
[FRANKY]
Word, brother.

313
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,427
I'm sure they'll wrap this up
and be back in a jiff.

314
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:24,368
[USOPP, LUFFY]
Ooh! Banquet!

315
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:27,104
The least we could do is
throw you a welcome party.

316
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:30,507
[FABRE] Mitsuboshi here went all
out and made a full on feast.

317
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,676
[MITSUBOSHI]
Go ahead and dig in!

318
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:38,615
[VILLAGERS]
Cheers!

319
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:40,451
[LUFFY, USOPP]
Yeah!

320
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,488
They're throwing a
party for pirates?

321
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,224
Now they're going too far!

322
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,625
[NAMI FAN A]
Okay, here we are.

323
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,494
[NAMI FAN C]
You can find the town square

324
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,528
right around the bend there.

325
00:17:51,562 --> 00:17:52,496
Yeah, y'know what?

326
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,398
You kept telling me
we were almost there.

327
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:55,999
But that walk took hours.

328
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,634
We just wanted
you to get the full tour

329
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:59,470
to enjoy the island is all.

330
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:00,671
[NAMI]
Hm?

331
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,143
[YOKO]
So you're a pirate too?

332
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:07,311
[NAMI]
Huh?

333
00:18:07,311 --> 00:18:08,979
Shouldn't you know better, lady?

334
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:12,649
Why would a woman wanna be
a pirate in the first place?

335
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:14,985
Really. Pirates
are all the same--

336
00:18:15,018 --> 00:18:17,254
just a bunch of
heartless bastards.

337
00:18:17,321 --> 00:18:18,322
Yoko!

338
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:20,524
Who do you think you are
talking to Nami like that?

339
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,727
Ow, stop! Ow! What're you doing!

340
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,596
[NAMI]
Hey. Wait!

341
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:30,400
I'm really sorry
about that, Nami.

342
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:34,037
You see, her father
was killed by pirates.

343
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:37,574
[NAMI]
Oh. I see.

344
00:18:39,343 --> 00:18:42,045
[VILLAGERS scream]

345
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,180
[NAMI gasps]

346
00:18:43,614 --> 00:18:45,382
That doesn't sound good!

347
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:52,623
[COLT cackles]

348
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,695
[COLT]
Attencion, por favor!

349
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:01,031
Yes, this way, look at me.

350
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:04,434
You are now under siege by
the notorious Amigo Pirates!

351
00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:06,803
You have only two options here.

352
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,106
Give us the beetle or die.

353
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:11,608
The beetle? Is he
talking about Boss?

354
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:13,377
How does he know about Boss?

355
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:24,221
Maybe you didn't
hear what I said.

356
00:19:24,254 --> 00:19:26,423
But these should
be loud enough.

357
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,802
[VILLAGERS scream]

358
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,610
Who are these guys?
What the heck is going on here?

359
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,811
I have no idea!

360
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:49,846
No! Don't go that way!

361
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:51,348
[YOKO gasps]

362
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:58,422
What? There are more pirates?

363
00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:00,490
I heard that you
got the big beetle

364
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:02,626
working as the
guardian of the island.

365
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,761
Shouldn't be hard to
put him out of a job.

366
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:06,597
I mean, what's the point
in staying here

367
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:08,365
if there's no one
left to protect?

368
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:10,267
Do you follow me?

369
00:20:12,135 --> 00:20:13,770
They're trying to capture Boss.

370
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:16,506
[BOSS groans]

371
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,610
[YOKO]
Don't do it, Boss. Stay there.

372
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,345
Don't let them see you.

373
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,854
[MITSUBOSHI whimpering]
My restaurant...

374
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:32,789
They destroyed it!

375
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,897
[MITSUBOSHI yells]

376
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:42,199
[MITSUBOSHI groans]
[VILLAGERS gasp]

377
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:44,334
[SANJI]
Old man!

378
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,669
Hey. Are you okay?

379
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,803
I think so.

380
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:50,641
[VILLAGERS sigh]

381
00:20:50,641 --> 00:20:53,577
[FABRE] I can speak on behalf
of the island's inhabitants.

382
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:56,513
[COLT] Then speak, and tell
us where the beetle is.

383
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,815
Sorry but we can't
give him to you.

384
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,717
You can take
everything else we have,

385
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:03,387
all of our money,
our food, anything!

386
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,223
Just take it all and go,
but you cannot have Boss!

387
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:07,858
Nice of you to give
us permission,

388
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,260
but that was kind of
the plan all along.

389
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:14,665
We're taking the beetle back,
and anything else we can carry.

390
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:17,668
[LUFFY sighs]
Oh boy, I am stuffed!

391
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:21,505
[COLT] Who are you? You're
kind of interrupting here.

392
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:23,840
Yeah, listen.
Go home, fancy hat.

393
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,409
[COLT]
What did you say to me?

394
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:26,877
[LUFFY]
Look, I already tried.

395
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,513
The beetle doesn't wanna
join a pirate crew.

396
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:31,515
So just leave him alone.

397
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:33,216
Are you serious right now?

398
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,420
Join our crew? You got
the wrong idea, idiot.

399
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:38,355
We're here to take
that beetle prisoner,

400
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:40,357
not make friends with him!

401
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,928
Eh? That is not
supposed to happen!

402
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:47,798
[LUFFY grunting]

403
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:50,767
[AMIGO PIRATES scream]

404
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:53,870
[LUFFY] You're gonna
need a better weapon.

405
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,872
Bullets don't work
on rubber men.

406
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:56,807
[YOKO gasps]

407
00:21:56,873 --> 00:21:58,375
You ate Diablo Fruit?

408
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,711
Why don't ya
try my Gum-Gum...

409
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:02,245
Whip!

410
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,215
Zoro! Sanji!

411
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:05,949
[ZORO]
We're on it!

412
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:07,884
[SANJI]
One step ahead of ya!

413
00:22:07,884 --> 00:22:08,885
[AMIGO PIRATE 427E]
Shoot them!

414
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:12,556
[AMIGO PIRATES groaning]

415
00:22:12,589 --> 00:22:14,491
[COLT groans]

416
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:18,462
Alright, fancy hat.
Wanna keep this goin'?

417
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,899
Me and that beetle are
supposed to fight tomorrow!

418
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,000
And you're not gonna stop--!

419
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:26,970
[LARGO]
Mucho Needle Net!

420
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:28,405
[LUFFY gasps]

421
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,674
[NAMI gasps]

422
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:31,808
Pointy!

423
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:35,312
[LUFFY groaning]

424
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:36,913
Luffy, no!

425
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:45,689
[LARGO] Amore! My beloved
baby brother Colt.

426
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:48,692
It saddens me so to see that
you are in such great pain.

427
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:52,629
I admire your elastic nature.
But you must pay the price.

428
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,030
Comeuppance, senor!

429
00:22:54,097 --> 00:22:56,433
[COLT] No one walks away
from my big bro!

430
00:22:56,466 --> 00:23:00,437
[LARGO laughs]
So melancholy.

431
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,806
What the hell is this thing?

432
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:17,287
[NARRATOR] With Luffy captured,
Zorro and Sanji find themselves

433
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,956
at a loss against
Largo's Net-Net powers.

434
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,692
As the Straw Hats struggle,
the giant beetle learns

435
00:23:22,726 --> 00:23:25,328
that he is the target of
the Amigo Pirate's attack,

436
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,398
and makes a grave decision
to protect his home.

437
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:30,033
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece.

438
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:32,836
A Special Presentation
Related to the Movie:

439
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,539
The Fierce Onslaught
of the Amigo Pirates.

440
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:37,707
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
