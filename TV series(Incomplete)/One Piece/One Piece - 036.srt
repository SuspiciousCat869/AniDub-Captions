00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:05,671
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power...

2
00:00:05,704 --> 00:00:07,407
Gold Roger, the King
of the Pirates,

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,246
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:13,620
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:15,289
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:00:15,323 --> 00:00:16,391
You can have it.

7
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:19,699
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:22,170
Now, you just have to find it.

9
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:26,612
[NARRATOR] These words
lured men to the Grand Line

10
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:27,715
in pursuit of dreams greater

11
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:29,652
than they've ever
dared to imagine!

12
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:32,558
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

13
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:38,636
<i>Come aboard and bring along</i>
<i>all your hopes and dreams</i>

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,447
<i>Together we will find everything</i>
<i>that we're looking for</i>

15
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:46,151
<i>One Piece!</i>

16
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:56,238
<i>Compass left behind</i>
<i>It'll only slow us down</i>

17
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:58,442
<i>Your heart will be your guide</i>

18
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,749
<i>Raise the sails</i>
<i>and take the helm</i>

19
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:07,460
<i>That legendary place that the</i>
<i>end of the map reveals</i>

20
00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:14,274
<i>Is only legendary</i>
<i>until someone proves it real</i>

21
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:17,280
<i>Through it all, through all</i>
<i>the troubled times,</i>

22
00:01:17,313 --> 00:01:19,852
<i>through the heartache,</i>
<i>and through the pain</i>

23
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:25,262
<i>Know that I will be there</i>
<i>to stand by you</i>

24
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:28,670
<i>Just like I know</i>
<i>you'll stand by me!</i>

25
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:34,414
<i>So come aboard and bring along</i>

00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:40,326
<i>Together we will find everything</i>

00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:46,304
<i>There's always room for you</i>

28
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:51,749
<i>We are, we are on the cruise</i>

29
00:01:51,782 --> 00:01:52,784
<i>We are!</i>

30
00:01:57,905 --> 00:02:00,811
[hums]

31
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:03,684
[VILLAGER A]
We will not abandon Bellemere!

32
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:06,355
[GENZO]
Damn it, why did this happen!

33
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:08,226
Hold on Bellemere!

34
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,564
Perfect...

35
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:13,704
There is nothing as
delicious as my sauce.

36
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:16,408
The duck needs about
another ten minutes,

37
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:17,778
but it's close...

38
00:02:17,812 --> 00:02:19,916
The stew is almost ready.

39
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:23,189
This is gonna
blow my budget, yup,

40
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:25,628
but sometimes
you gotta live a little.

41
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:34,378
[knocking]

42
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,948
Oh, they're here.

43
00:02:38,286 --> 00:02:41,893
[LUFFY] "Survive! Mother
Bellemere and Nami's Bond!"

44
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,729
[knocking]

45
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,835
[BELLEMERE]
It's open! Come in!

46
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,008
Why, thanks.

47
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:38,840
[BELLEMERE] I guess you weren't
expecting a former Marine.

48
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:39,842
Now what would a pirate

49
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:43,717
from the Grand Line want
with Cocoyashi Village.

50
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:50,430
What's so funny?

51
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,902
Hahahahaha!

52
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:54,806
[gasps]

53
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:01,753
Useless... Foolish...
Stupid... Empty... Worthless.

54
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:06,796
All of you humans... You have
no strength to speak of.

55
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:12,040
Hahahaha!

56
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:15,848
[NAMI] We'll help her
escape through the back door.

57
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,918
What if the pirates
are already there?

58
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:18,820
[NAMI]
It'll be okay.

59
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:20,657
[DOCTOR]
Stop!

60
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,464
Doctor!

61
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,168
You can't go back home.

62
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:28,640
‐‐[NOJIKO] What?
‐‐But we have to save Bellemere!

63
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:31,579
Nojiko, Nami...!
Quiet and listen to me...

64
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:35,721
There will be times... times
in life like this moment now...

65
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:37,892
...when you have to
learn the truth no matter

66
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:39,829
how hard it is to take.

67
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:41,465
[NOJIKO]
Doctor!

68
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,503
[BELLEMERE screams]

69
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:45,641
Bellemere, no!!

70
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:50,149
Auuuugh!!

71
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,859
[BELLEMERE]
It's no use.

72
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:59,034
These guys are real monsters
and I'm going to die.

73
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,806
Nojiko. Nami.

74
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,942
[GENZO]
Bellemere!!

75
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:05,848
Don't waste your life
because you're a stubborn fool.

76
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:07,518
There's no reason for this fight

77
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:11,091
when it can be resolved with
a simple exchange of money.

78
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,233
Just pay the fee,
and I'll stop.

79
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:16,903
A hundred thousand
for each adult

80
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:18,974
and fifty for each kid if any.

81
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:20,811
If you can pay for
your whole family,

82
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:22,715
I'd gladly spare your lives.

83
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:24,519
Family?

84
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:28,727
How much money do you have...?

85
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,265
You need two hundred thousand.

86
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,004
I don't have it...

87
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:35,941
I'm not even close.

88
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,617
Hey, the table is
set for three in here.

89
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:46,696
Oh, a family of three.
Hahahaha!

90
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:49,067
It's for me and my friend...

91
00:05:50,136 --> 00:05:52,741
[GENZO] We were supposed
to have a nice dinner tonight

92
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:55,212
before you came.

93
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:58,753
Come, Bellemere I know you've
made something wonderful.

94
00:05:58,787 --> 00:06:00,757
Pay them before
our food gets cold.

95
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,893
Genzo.

96
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:06,201
Just pay the pirates...
and then they'll leave us alone.

97
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:08,940
Now everyone is saved.

98
00:06:08,974 --> 00:06:10,042
It's true...

99
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,879
The village register
shows no record

100
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,417
of her marrying
or giving birth...

101
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,823
She's always been single.

102
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:21,431
Listen...

103
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:25,039
There's no way that the pirates
will ever find out about you...

104
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:28,012
But you have to leave
this island immediately...

105
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:30,149
And don't ever look back.

106
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,857
It's the only way for all
three of you to survive.

107
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,927
We can't afford
it any other way.

108
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,998
You're much too young
to be at sea alone,

109
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:41,104
but you've survived before
and if there's even a chance‐‐

110
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:41,806
[NAMI]
No.

111
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,975
[gasps]

112
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:44,912
[NAMI]
I don't want to.

113
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,381
Why do we have to leave?

114
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:50,757
They're the ones who came here.

115
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:54,097
I... I want to
stay in this village.

116
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,903
It's because... we're poor.

117
00:06:56,936 --> 00:06:59,307
That's why we
can't stay together.

118
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:03,917
[NAMI] Why?
Why can't they just go away?

119
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:09,762
Well then... now we
can all be safe.

120
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:10,797
Fine, we'll leave this island.

121
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:11,866
Nojiko.

122
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:15,339
[NOJIKO] We have to
leave or Bellemere will die!

123
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:34,244
[BELLEMERE] Wait!
Who said I was paying for me?

124
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:38,520
That money I gave up was
for my two daughters...

125
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:40,322
But I can't pay you.

126
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:41,826
[gasps]

127
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:42,426
[ARLONG]
Hmmm?

128
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,863
What are you doing?

129
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,332
It's okay...

130
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:48,540
I... have to do
this for my family.

131
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:51,144
Even if it costs me my life.

132
00:07:53,382 --> 00:07:54,417
Stupid girl.

133
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,593
It's true the three of us
aren't related by blood,

134
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:00,462
but we're family...

135
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:03,468
All I've ever wanted
was to be their mother.

136
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:08,278
And now... I can be.

137
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:11,384
[NAMI, NOJIKO]
Bellemere!

138
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:13,222
I wish someone
rich would've adopted us

139
00:08:13,255 --> 00:08:15,560
instead of a
stinky loser like you!

140
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:17,564
[NAMI]
It was a lie!

141
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,467
I was lying Bellemere!

142
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,404
[NOJIKO]
Bellemere!

143
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,268
Don't cry girls...

144
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:37,604
I wish I could have...

145
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:40,376
I could have provided
for you better...

146
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,579
I wish...

147
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:44,551
...I could have been a better
mother to the both of you.

148
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:45,587
Don't say that!

149
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,423
[NAMI] We don't need
anything, just don't die!

150
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:49,260
Don't ever leave us!

151
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:51,064
[NAMI] You need to see
the map I'm going to draw

152
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,335
of the whole world!

153
00:08:54,304 --> 00:08:56,575
Yes... your map...

154
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:59,347
Go and make
your dreams come true.

155
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:04,123
For me.

156
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:05,593
Bellemere, no!

157
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:10,637
[ARLONG]
So these are your daughters.

158
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:13,275
[NOJIKO gasps]

159
00:09:13,308 --> 00:09:14,477
Yeah, that's right...

160
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:17,651
And you have to promise me
that you'll leave them alone.

161
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:19,053
No problem...

162
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:21,124
...as long as you
die like a good girl.

163
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:21,592
Help us.

164
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,663
[screams]

165
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:34,752
Well then...

166
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:39,628
Don't kill them boys.
No, just teach them a lesson.

167
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:42,801
Now to set an example.

168
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:46,408
Ahh!

169
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:50,049
Hmph! You ready to die?

170
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:01,739
Nojiko... Nami!

171
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,349
Love you...

172
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:18,138
[GENZO]
You just never learn do you?

173
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:20,844
[NAMI]
Let go! I'll pay you later...

174
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:22,146
...any way you want.

175
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:22,948
Ahh!

176
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:24,551
[BELLEMERE]
You made a boy cry?

177
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:25,854
[NOJIKO]
He made me mad!

178
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:28,793
[MOTHER] Oh, it's okay.
Kids will be kids.

179
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:30,597
[NAMI]
He said your tangerines suck.

180
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,364
[BELLEMERE]
He what?!

181
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,801
[MOTHER]
Bellemere!

182
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:39,715
[BELLEMERE]
Never give up...

183
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:45,660
You must find the strength
inside you to always move on...

184
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:48,398
You must live
through every moment.

185
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:56,314
[BELLEMERE] And if you can
smile in the face of it all,

186
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:59,287
that is the greatest strength.

187
00:10:59,888 --> 00:11:02,727
[NAMI, NOJIKO]
Bellemere!

188
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,771
Hahahaha!

189
00:11:07,804 --> 00:11:11,377
While I'm in charge
those without money will die!

190
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:14,016
Now do you understand
me, you worms?!

191
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,691
Hahahahaha!

192
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:19,360
[HATCHAN]
What's this?

193
00:11:19,393 --> 00:11:20,262
A map?

194
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:21,364
[NAMI]
No!

195
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:22,066
That's my map!

196
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,303
I drew it. You can't have it!

197
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:26,775
A child drew this?

198
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:27,544
Give it back!

199
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:29,013
[NOJIKO]
Nami, No!

200
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,683
[ARLONG]
Hmmm...

201
00:11:31,752 --> 00:11:32,954
Very good.

202
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:34,023
[gasps]

203
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:36,962
[ARLONG] She could be useful.
Bring her with us.

204
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:37,797
[HATCHAN]
Right!

205
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:42,006
Waaaah! No! Help!

206
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,475
Let her go! Let her go!

207
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:44,578
[GENZO]
Wait!

208
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:47,951
You promised not to hurt her
if you got your money.

209
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:51,759
Right, I won't hurt her,
just borrow her for a while.

210
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:53,495
Genzo, help me.

211
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,432
I won't let you take her.

212
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,602
Kuroobi.

213
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,785
Genzo! Genzo! Genzo!

214
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:06,922
GENZO!

215
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,005
I'll... I'll save you Nami...

216
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:17,476
I won't let you go.

217
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,514
No, please...! It's okay...!

218
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:21,752
You don't need to save me!

219
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:22,721
Enough of this!

220
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:24,725
[GENZO]
I will... save you.

221
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:31,605
[NAMI]
Please, no more killing!!

222
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:59,209
[DOCTOR] All of our
ships have been sunk...

223
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:02,348
I'm afraid our plan to
have Nami and Nojiko escape

224
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,386
to the sea was...

225
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,156
...a bad plan.

226
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,162
The marines won't
bother trying to save us...

227
00:13:09,196 --> 00:13:10,832
We've lost our island.

228
00:13:10,865 --> 00:13:13,304
Bellemere knew that
this would happen...

229
00:13:13,337 --> 00:13:15,541
Her experiences in
the marines taught her

230
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:18,814
what all these creatures
are capable of.

231
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:21,653
She knew that none
of us would escape.

232
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:26,563
[NOJIKO sobs]

233
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,834
They've taken Nami...

234
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:32,275
What am I supposed to do now?

235
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:33,777
Bellemere...

236
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,391
[DOCTOR] We know where
Arlong and his crew are!

237
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:41,293
It looks like they're going

238
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:43,464
to settle right here
on this island...

239
00:13:43,497 --> 00:13:45,234
It's time to decide.

240
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:47,238
We can fight to
the death right now...

241
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:49,509
or we can take a chance
that the marines will some day

242
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:50,978
come to save us
and hope and pray

243
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:52,949
we don't get
killed before then...

244
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:54,219
Your choice!

245
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:57,892
[GENZO] Only marine headquarters
stands a chance against them.

246
00:13:58,427 --> 00:14:01,333
But they have their hands
full with the Grand Line...

247
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:03,504
The chances that they would
come all the way out here

248
00:14:03,537 --> 00:14:05,908
for us are as good as zero.

249
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:09,516
But I can't just sit here
and abandon Nami...

250
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,952
We must fight.

251
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:14,259
I'm in...

252
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:16,028
I can't just stand by
and do nothing

253
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:17,832
when a child is in danger.

254
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:19,836
Now who else will
come fight beside us?

255
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:21,473
I don't care if they kill me,

256
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:23,277
I'm going to save
that little brat.

257
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,913
[VILLAGER 3] Bellemere
gave her life for those girls,

258
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:26,048
we should do no less!

259
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:27,285
[VILLAGER 4]
Let's fight!

260
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:29,522
[VILLAGER 5] If just one of
us fights they'll blame us all,

261
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:30,858
so let's do it!

262
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,601
[BELLEMERE]
Good things will come your way,

263
00:14:35,635 --> 00:14:38,507
as long as you continue to live.

264
00:14:45,086 --> 00:14:46,456
[gasps]

265
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,494
[NOJIKO]
Nami! Nami!

266
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:49,262
[VILLAGER 1]
Nami!

267
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:49,929
[VILLAGER 2]
What?!

268
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:51,767
[VILLAGER 3]
You're okay!

269
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,608
[NOJIKO]
Nami, Nami...! Are you okay...?

270
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:57,478
Did they hurt you any?

271
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:01,085
Hey...

272
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:03,891
[NAMI]
I'm... joining them.

273
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:05,761
[NOJKIO]
Huh?

274
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:08,667
[NAMI]
I'm joining Arlong's crew.

275
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:10,103
[gasps]

276
00:15:10,136 --> 00:15:13,510
I'm joining the
Arlong pirates...

277
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:15,915
I'll get to be a
navigator and draw maps.

278
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,489
[ALL gasp]

279
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:23,731
Heh... What in the world
are you talking about?

280
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:25,468
Stand back...

281
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:28,005
Did they threaten to do
something terrible to you...?

282
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,943
Please... tell me.

283
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:30,644
[NAMI]
No.

284
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:31,913
They must have done something!

285
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:32,982
No!

286
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:33,884
Tell the truth!

287
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:35,588
[NAMI]
Let go of me!

288
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:36,122
Nami.

289
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:38,927
[gasping]

290
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:39,963
[NOJIKO]
No!

291
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,839
But... that's an...
Arlong tattoo.

292
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,843
Not you.

293
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:48,580
But why?

294
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:53,590
Look at this... They
gave me all this money.

295
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:59,736
Heh heh... They say...
they'll buy me anything I want.

296
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:00,671
[NOJIKO]
No...!

297
00:16:00,704 --> 00:16:02,708
I will never forgive you
if you join them!

298
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:04,245
Don't you understand?!

299
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,516
They killed Bellemere
in front of us!

300
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,985
She died to keep us safe.

301
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:10,191
I'll never forgive you! Never!

302
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:11,560
You're not my sister!

303
00:16:11,593 --> 00:16:12,428
Who cares?

304
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:13,764
Why would I want
to live like Bellemere

305
00:16:13,797 --> 00:16:15,601
if it just gets you killed?

306
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:18,240
I don't wanna die like that!

307
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:22,815
[NOJIKO]
How could you...?

308
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:26,189
[NOJIKO]
Bellemere...

309
00:16:26,223 --> 00:16:27,258
Bellemere gave her life

310
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,129
so that you and I could
go on living... together.

311
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,869
[GENZO]
That's enough, Nojiko!

312
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:34,137
Leave us Nami!

313
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:37,143
Never set foot
in this village again!

314
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:47,532
[NOJIKO]
Nami!

315
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:54,712
[GENZO]
I don't understand.

316
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:57,685
How could she betray
her family like that?

317
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:59,822
For money?

318
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:02,795
Bellemere was like her mother.

319
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,719
[NOJIKO]
Nami loved Bellemere...

320
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:16,790
I know she did.

321
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:26,008
[NAMI]
Hey...

322
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:30,016
[NAMI]
Didn't Bellemere always say...

323
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,288
..."Good things
will come your way,

324
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:35,728
as long as you
continue to live.

325
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:37,965
Lots of good things."

326
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,404
[NOJIKO]
Yes.

327
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:43,142
[NAMI] After Arlong
took me I watched him

328
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:46,850
sink five marine ships
like they were toys.

329
00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:49,255
I don't think
they'll send any more.

330
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:51,192
We're on our own.

331
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:54,097
So I decided I'd do
something about it.

332
00:17:54,131 --> 00:17:57,905
I made a deal with Arlong to
buy Cocoyashi village from him.

333
00:17:57,938 --> 00:17:59,709
[NOJIKO]
Buy Cocoyashi?

334
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:01,111
How?

335
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:04,419
[NAMI]
For 100 million berries.

336
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:09,395
If I buy the town,
we'll be free.

337
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,733
No else will die.

338
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:14,906
And all I have to do is join
his crew and draw maps.

339
00:18:14,939 --> 00:18:16,743
[NOJIKO]
But 100 million berries!

340
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:19,282
You can't earn that
working your whole life.

341
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:22,020
[NAMI] I will get that
money no matter what.

342
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:23,457
People are having
a hard enough time

343
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,467
paying their own tribute
so I have to do this alone.

344
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,906
If anyone tries to help me,
they'll just get hurt.

345
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:39,922
[NOJIKO]
Won't it be hard?

346
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:41,292
[NAMI]
Yeah...

347
00:18:41,326 --> 00:18:44,332
[NOJIKO] Living with the
people who killed our mother?

348
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:46,001
[NAMI]
I'll be okay.

349
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:49,175
I'll just smile
every time I see his face.

350
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,046
I'm not going to cry anymore.

351
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:57,391
I'm going to fight by myself.

352
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:20,936
[NOJIKO]
To make a choice like that

353
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:23,541
when you're only ten years old.

354
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:26,513
Do you know how hard
that must have been?

355
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:32,092
All to save the
village she loved so much...

356
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,094
That girl...

357
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:34,196
Ahhhh!

358
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:37,502
Whoever makes Nami suffer's
going to hear from me!

359
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:40,676
Why'd you do that?

360
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:43,949
Because... I'm telling
you to stay out of it...

361
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,553
If you go around saying
that she's your friend,

362
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:48,792
they're going to become
suspicious of her.

363
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:50,161
Then her eight
years of suffering

364
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:52,499
will have been for nothing.

365
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,773
Don't make it harder
than it already is.

366
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:57,810
She has to fight alone.

367
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:58,945
Knowing there are people

368
00:19:58,979 --> 00:20:01,851
who call her "friend" only
makes the suffering worse.

369
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:18,752
[PIRATE A]
Get back here you little brat!

370
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,188
[PIRATE B]
Stop!

371
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:24,496
[NOJIKO]
A pirate thief?

372
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:25,598
[NAMI]
That's right.

373
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:26,801
The only thing
this place has going

374
00:20:26,835 --> 00:20:29,807
for it is plenty of
pirates to steal from.

375
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:31,744
[NAMI]
I'm gonna make 'em pay!

376
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:33,247
[NOJIKO]
You're all cut up!

377
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,752
[NAMI]
Yeah, I kinda screwed up.

378
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:37,923
But look, one million berries.

379
00:20:37,957 --> 00:20:38,892
[NOJIKO]
Who cares about that?

380
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:40,127
You need a doctor!

381
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:43,167
[NAMI] It's nothing,
these cuts are nothing!

382
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:46,073
[NAMI]
No one will find it here.

383
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:48,577
I'll save up little by little.

384
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:53,254
By the time this is filled
I'll have my hundred million.

385
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:56,995
[NAMI]
Still a long way to go.

386
00:20:57,997 --> 00:21:02,673
[NAMI]
100 million Berries...

387
00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:08,183
It's taken awhile
but only 7 million left...

388
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:11,590
I can get that
with one more job...

389
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:15,298
Just one more trip and
this will finally be over.

390
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:18,270
Arlong's rule will be over...

391
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:21,076
Cocoyashi village
will be free...

392
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:25,318
I will be free... and then...

393
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,622
And then I think
I'll finally be able

394
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:30,929
to smile again for real.

395
00:21:31,764 --> 00:21:33,067
Bellemere...

396
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:52,205
[GENZO]
So why do the Marines want Nami?

397
00:21:53,207 --> 00:21:56,981
[NEZUMI] Your job is
to lead the way, quietly.

398
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,856
A hat pinwheel...

399
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:03,327
Where in the world
did he get that?

400
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:05,364
It's so cool.

401
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:15,351
One more little job...
Let's get to it.

402
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:24,970
[NAMI]
Marines!

403
00:22:25,004 --> 00:22:27,108
Why is Genzo with them?

404
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:33,320
Are you the
pirate thief known as Nami?

405
00:22:34,155 --> 00:22:35,992
[NEZUMI] According
to our investigation,

406
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:37,128
you've buried a good deal

407
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:41,103
of plundered treasure somewhere
in this tangerine grove.

408
00:22:42,472 --> 00:22:44,375
[NEZUMI]
Now, you stole from pirates,

409
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:46,379
so we have no
intention of arresting you,

410
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:49,119
but theft is theft.

411
00:22:49,987 --> 00:22:51,991
Therefore as of this moment...

412
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:57,468
...stolen goods... become... the
sole property of the government.

413
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,874
Now hand it all over!

414
00:23:01,576 --> 00:23:03,046
[NEZUMI]
It's ours!

415
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:08,257
<i>All that's in my heart</i>
<i>confuses me</i>

416
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,261
<i>I cannot understand</i>

417
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:12,365
<i>As I face what I must do</i>

418
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:15,137
<i>I'll say goodbye</i>
<i>and squeeze your hand</i>

419
00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:16,941
<i>I'll set sail alone</i>

420
00:23:16,974 --> 00:23:20,181
<i>But always know</i>
<i>I'm gonna keep you near</i>

421
00:23:20,214 --> 00:23:21,951
<i>As I drift away</i>

422
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:25,524
<i>I pray you watch me</i>
<i>as I disappear</i>

423
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:32,438
<i>As I watch the sunrise</i>

424
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:34,977
<i>I began to wonder</i>

425
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,887
<i>What could be the reason</i>
<i>It's so hot inside</i>

426
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,158
<i>No answer has come</i>

427
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:46,233
<i>But I can't get away</i>
<i>from what's true</i>

428
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:51,142
<i>It's because of you</i>

429
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:53,347
<i>Show me how to</i>
<i>catch those feelings</i>

430
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,019
<i>Get 'em to come back to me</i>

431
00:23:56,052 --> 00:23:57,521
<i>I'll do what I must</i>

432
00:23:57,555 --> 00:24:00,962
<i>Because they're</i>
<i>everything I wanna be</i>

433
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:03,100
<i>Wrap these arms around my dreams</i>

434
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,604
<i>And pull 'em back from yesterday</i>

435
00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:08,110
<i>If I'm holding hands with you</i>

436
00:24:08,143 --> 00:24:10,949
<i>I'm sure that we can</i>
<i>make the way</i>

437
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:21,503
[USOPP] Alright, now we
know all about this island.

438
00:24:21,536 --> 00:24:23,206
Let's hurry up
and meet with Luffy.

439
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,242
[SANJI]
Yeah!

440
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:25,344
[USOPP]
What're you doing?

441
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:26,681
[SANJI]
Enjoying the moment.

442
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:29,987
I can end Nami's suffering
with my own two hands.

443
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,423
[LUFFY]
Hey, Nami? What's wrong?

444
00:24:31,456 --> 00:24:32,693
[NAMI]
You're still here?

445
00:24:32,726 --> 00:24:34,997
Just leave this island already!

446
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,599
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

447
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:39,740
"Luffy Rises! Result
of the Broken Promise!"

448
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:42,178
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
