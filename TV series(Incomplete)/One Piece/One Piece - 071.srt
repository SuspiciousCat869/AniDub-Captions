00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,485
Some become dinosaur food,

181
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,655
some die from heat or
thirst or starvation.

182
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,158
Others are killed because
they stupidly attack us.

183
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,194
Whatever the case,
they all die here somehow.

184
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,130
An entire year on
this island just seems

185
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,700
to be too long. So far,
no humans have been able

186
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,035
to survive here
for the full year.

187
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,770
[VIVI]
What are we going to do?

188
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,540
Even if we could manage
to last here for a year,

189
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,208
who knows what could
happen by then?

190
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,811
My country could be lost.

191
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,179
She's right.

192
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,648
Plus, I'd get bored
here after a year.

193
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,217
Isn't there anything else
we can do about it, old man?

194
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,153
[DORRY] Hm... We do have
an Eternal Pose here,

195
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,557
but it's magnetic link is
to our home village, Elbaf.

196
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,659
Basically, that Eternal Pose
is what Broggy and I

197
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,296
have been fighting for with
our duels this whole time.

198
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,898
Of course, you can try
to take it by force.

199
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,634
No, that's not gonna work.

200
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,003
Elbaf isn't the place that
we're trying to get to.

201
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,872
We just wanna get to the island
that's right after this one.

202
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:40,806
Right?

203
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,208
[VIVI]
Yes.

204
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,010
We must stay on the route
that's going to lead us

205
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,846
to my home, or else
there's no point.

206
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,148
Yeah.

207
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,751
Maybe you can try
sailing forward randomly.

208
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,653
You may get there eventually,

209
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,022
if you're real lucky.

210
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,032
[LUFFY laughs]

211
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,600
Maybe so.

212
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,869
[laughs]

213
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,005
[LUFFY]
We may actually get there!

214
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,741
[laughs]

215
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,209
[DORRY] Now that I think
about it, someone did

216
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,212
leave the island once
before his log was reset.

217
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,747
[LUFFY]
And what happened to him?

218
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,249
[DORRY]
How should I know that?

219
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,885
[LUFFY] I'm sure he was able
to get to the next island.

220
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,053
[DORRY]
That must be it!

221
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:31,257
[DORRY, LUFFY laughing]

222
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,092
[VIVI]
What is so funny?

223
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:40,032
[DORRY, LUFFY laughing]

224
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,567
[VIVI] I don't understand
what these two idiots

225
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,539
are laughing about
at a time like this!

226
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,761
[BROGGY] A brave warrior
of the seas, you said?

227
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,129
What's that exactly?

228
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,964
I'm talking about you guys!

229
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:15,067
What I really want is to be
like the two of you someday!

230
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,903
Huh? You wanna be a giant?

231
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:18,637
[NAMI]
You hear that?

232
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,107
[USOPP]
That's not what I mean!

233
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,008
I wanna be a great warrior.

234
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,643
I wanna be brave
and proud like you

235
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,612
and the others from Elbaf.

236
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,649
[laughs]

237
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,184
I see.

238
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,587
You know, in Elbaf,
even though our lifespans

239
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,856
are longer than yours are,
we still think about

240
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,091
how we will die.

241
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,926
We know everything
we have and everything

242
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,797
we are will one day cease
to exist, like everything else.

243
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,767
But it is worth it to die
a true warrior of Elbaf,

244
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,769
without sacrificing
your pride.

245
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,138
That is what we call
dying with honor.

246
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,939
To die such a great death

247
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,108
would be an
everlasting treasure.

248
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,944
It's what we seek in Elbaf.

249
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,946
So pride is your treasure.

250
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,548
That's great!

251
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,016
I've decided to learn from you!

252
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,952
From now on,
I'll call you Master!

253
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,154
[BROGGY]
Huh?

254
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,657
[DORRY groans]

255

[LUFFY, VIVI gasp]

261

Old giant guy!

262
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,577
[LUFFY]
What's going on?

263
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,312
Why did it explode?

264
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,080
That was the same
alcohol we had with us

265
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,883
on the ship, wasn't it?

266
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,652
[DORRY groans]

267
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,220
[VIVI]
It exploded in his stomach!

268
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,923
The other giant must
have booby trapped it!

269
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,593
Hold it! Were you
even watching them?!

270
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,161
They fight their
duels honorably!

271
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,063
No way he'd do that!

272
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,667
All right, then who did do it?

273
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,239
You strangers.

274
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:04,677
[DORRY growls]
It wasn't Broggy.

275
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,545
No way...

276
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,748
No warrior of Elbaf
would dare. So...

277
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,885
Who else is there to suspect
on this island then...

278
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,920
...besides you?

279
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:15,921
[KAROO screams]

280
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,122
Let's get out of here!

281
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,191
There's no use talking
to him right now.

282
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,794
I doubt running
would do us any good.

283
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,730
Hold on to this and stay back.

284
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,900
You're going to... fight Dorry?

285
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,702
[panting]

286
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,903
[knuckles crack]

287
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,972
Yeah. I don't want to,

288
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,874
but we have to settle this.

289
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,281
Don't do it, you guys! Stop it!

290
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,083
Dorry, please just listen to me!

291
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,318
We don't know anything about
the explosives in the barrels,

292
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,621
I promise! We wouldn't do that.

293
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:52,591
You can't be in any shape to
fight right now, so please stop!

294
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,728
Right.

295
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,265
Why should I believe you liars?!

No! Luffy!

00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,980
I see now.

319
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,815
He has some power from...

[coughs]

321
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,218

Luffy! Are you all right?

327
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,018
How is he?

328
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,387
[VIVI]
He should be okay.

329
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,355
I guess you were
right about fighting.

330
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,859
He's certainly a lot calmer now.

331
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,761
[LUFFY]
Well, I'm not!

332
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,731
The old guy was right
about one thing, anyway.

333
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,134
The other giant would never
do anything like this.

334
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,403
But I know that our friends
wouldn't do it either.

335
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,772
They aren't like that.

336
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,907
Yeah. Then who?

337
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,079
[LUFFY] There must be
somebody else on this island.

338
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,388
[MR. 3]
The key to winning any game

339
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,091
is to know your opponent's
state of mind.

340
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,927
For now, we have succeeded
in confusing our enemy.

341
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,263
They are no doubt wondering
about the mysterious bomb

342
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,931
that we delivered.

343
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,935
And about the identity
of their invisible enemy.

344
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:50,769
Our first target

345
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,138
was the long‐bearded
giant, Dorry.

346
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,274
I knew, of course, that it
would be nearly impossible

347
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,742
to finish him off,

348
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,777
but the damage done to
his stomach by the bomb

349
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,946
must have been considerable.

350
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,014
Now...

351
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,117
We can sit here enjoying
our tea while relaxing...

352
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,020
...and wait for the
next duel to start.

353
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,122
So we stay in the
background and let the giant

354
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,790
kill off the injured one?

355
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,127
[MR. 3 chuckles]
Yes, that's exactly right.

356
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,429
That's certainly
an indirect method.

357
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,198
[MR. 3] Again, you have
to consider your enemy.

358
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,834
Warriors like these two
operate in much the same way

359
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:22,801
as wild boars.

360
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,937
They can be intimidating
in a head‐on fight,

361
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,138
but they don't have

362
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,807
the brains to think beyond
their immediate circumstance.

363
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,342
So why bother going
after them directly

364
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,046
when you have the intelligence
to destroy them indirectly?

365
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,982
[MR. 3 chuckles]

366
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,455
[MR. 3]
Hm...

367
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,401
[MR. 3] Why can't you
just get the tea yourself,

368
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,303
Miss Golden Week?

369
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,038
[MR. 5] And just what
are we supposed to do

370
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,507
with the Straw Hat Gang?

371
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,175
Straw Hat Gang...?

372
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,510
Oh, you're talking
about the little brats

373
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,546
who found out
the Boss's secrets.

374
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,315
We can start by luring
them out one by one.

375
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,518
The order doesn't matter really.

376
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:16,355
Let's start with the one
closest to my tea set.

377
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,023
I have a personal
motto, you know:

378
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,859
And that is, "Big crimes
via cheap tricks."

379
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,861
[laughs]

380
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,230
There are plenty of good
ways to defeat any enemy‐‐

381
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,399
all without fighting.

382
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,535
Hey, Mr. 3, refill.

383
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,003
Yeah. While you're up.

384
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,271
[MR. 3]
Can't you savages take some time

385
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,239
to actually savor your tea?!

386
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,875
[rumbling, explosions]

387
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,911
[gasps]

388
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,213
That's their signal... isn't it?

389
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:50,455
[rumbling, explosions]

390
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,458
Well, damn. Guess my time is up.

391
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,526
[BABY DINOSAUR whines]

392
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,428
Oh! Sorry, buddy.

393
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,231
[ZORO]
Ow! God, let go!

394
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,432
I said I'm sorry, come on!

395
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,301
I don't have time to
mess around with this!

396
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,902
Cut it out, you little brute!

397
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,971
Seriously, I do not
have time for this!

398
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,140
I don't have any
big game to bring back

399
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,541
and that was the signal.

400
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,444
Dammit. Guess my time's up.

401
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,321
[BROGGY]
Well, there's the signal.

402
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,591
[BROGGY]
It's really been active today.

403
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:26,725
You're really going?

404
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:30,295
But your wounds from the
last battle haven't healed!

405
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,263
Please!

406
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,433
Dorry can't be doing
any better than me!

407
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,338
[BROGGY laughs]

408
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,007
A few scratches won't
take me out of a duel!

409
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,077
That would sure make me a poor
excuse for a brave warrior.

410
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,913
[laughs]

411
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:55,988

[LUFFY]
Wait, giant guy!

413
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:58,590
Don't!

414
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,959
[VIVI] You can't fight,
Dorry! You need to rest!

415
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,962
You'll die if you
push yourself too hard!

416
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:09,034
I will fight... I am Dorry...

417
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,502
I will‐‐ [sputters]

418
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:14,940
...fight... for Elbaf's
pride and die as a warrior.
