1
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:50,790
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,250
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,919
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,588
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,091
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:04,596
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:10,310
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:18,151
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow</i>

9
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:22,781
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:25,950
<i>Sailed toward different dreams</i>

11
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:27,952
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:32,999
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see</i>

13
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:38,380
<i>And we know that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here</i>

14
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:42,384
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny</i>

15
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,095
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:47,389
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:52,644
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past</i>

18
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:54,521
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:59,442
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>We know we'll get there</i>

20
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:01,486
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:07,242
<i>Every tear that we've cried</i>
<i>only helps our dreams come true</i>

22
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:14,290
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life</i>

23
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:21,798
<i>A glimpse of the sun rising</i>
<i>on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:36,354
[NARRATOR] While Eneru
was occupied with Sanji's

25
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:38,606
last-ditch act of defiance...

26
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,243
Usopp succeeded
in rescuing Sanji.

27
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:55,832
Meanwhile, Luffy headed
up Giant Jack

28
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:58,209
to settle the score
with Eneru.

29
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:02,589
[LUFFY]
Robin!

30
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:04,841
The golden bell is at the
top of this vine, right?

31
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:06,092
[AISA yelling]

32
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:07,177
[ROBIN]
Luffy!

33
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,263
[AISA laughs]

34
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:11,890
[NAMI]
Aisa!

35
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:15,310
[NARRATOR] They had but a mere
moment to enjoy their reunion,

36
00:03:15,393 --> 00:03:17,520
for Eneru had repaired the Maxim

37
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:20,023
and was proceeding
with his terrible plan.

38
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:23,693
[ENERU]
Mamaragan.

39
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:33,328
[VILLAGERS yelling]

40
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:35,038
[NAMI]
Guys! Go now!

41
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:37,832
Once I find Luffy,
we'll be right behind you!

42
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:42,712
Magnificent!

43
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:44,506
[LUFFY]
Eneru!

44
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:47,175
You better not think for a
second that I'm gonna let you

45
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:49,552
get away with this!

46
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:51,388
Oh, crap!
He's not holding back!

47
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:53,014
We gotta move!

48
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:54,891
Everything here is done for!

49
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:04,984
[ENERU] So, that's where those
detestable Shandorian warriors

50
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:06,736
have hidden their village.

51
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:10,532
They're originally
from the Blue Sea.

52
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:13,576
Surely they would
love to go home!

53
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,039
[laughing]

54
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:21,376
Now, fall to the world below!

55
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:30,510
Our village, no!

56
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:32,095
It's been destroyed!

57
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:33,972
[GIRLS cry]

58
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:35,598
[VILLAGER B]
That could've been us.

59
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:38,643
If we had waited any longer,
we'd be ashes.

60
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:49,612
[CHIEFTAIN] In the name of
Great Warrior Kalgara.

61
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:55,869
Light the fire of Shandora!

62
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:02,083
[AISA]
Wyper!

63
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,669
[CHIEFTAIN]
Wyper.

64
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:06,880
Great Warrior Kalgara.

65
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:10,050
Your distant ancestor had
many reasons for wanting

66
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,926
to take back our homeland.

67
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,054
But one you may not know.

68
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:16,681
He had another reason?

69
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:17,724
[CHIEFTAIN]
Yes.

70
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:19,976
It would become
his greatest regret.

71
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:23,480
Now, listen.

72
00:05:23,563 --> 00:05:27,567
Great Warrior Kalgara
had a very close friend.

73
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,194
[KID WYPER]
Kalgara had a friend?

74
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:32,906
[CHIEFTAIN]
That's right.

75
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:37,702
He came to know
Kalgara 400 years ago.

76
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:40,205
His name...

77
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:42,123
...Montblanc Noland!

78
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,921
[LUFFY]
"Led by a Bell's Sound!

79
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:51,132
Tale of the Great Warrior
and the Explorer!"

80
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:01,142
[NARRATOR] The following tale
took place long, long ago--

81
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,770
some 400 years in the past.

82
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:05,605
And though it was
never written down,

83
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,692
it has remained in people's
hearts from one generation

84
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:11,194
to the next.

85
00:06:11,277 --> 00:06:15,073
It is the true story of a
warrior known as a monster

86
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:18,201
and an adventurer
known as a liar.

87
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,415
[SAILOR A]
Get back to the ship, quick!

88
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:26,334
[SAILOR B] The monster of
Shandora is right behind us!

89
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:28,670
[CAPTAIN]
Hurry! Cast off! Cast off!

90
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:30,213
[NAVIGATOR] But Captain,
there are still crewmen--

91
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:31,923
[CAPTAIN]
Just get us out to sea!

92
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:38,972
[SAILORS yell]

93
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:49,607
[SAILORS yelling]

94
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:53,820
[KALGARA]
Now you'll face my wrath!

95
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:56,614
[SAILORS yelling]

96
00:06:57,824 --> 00:06:59,325
Gah!

97
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:03,580
Gah!

98
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:10,754
Leave your possessions.

99
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:12,714
Flee with your lives!

100
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:14,799
[chuckling]

101
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:21,931
[SAILOR D]
Sir! The daily report!

102
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:24,059
I'm sorry to inform you
that we've reached the end

103
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:25,560
of our food supply.

104
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:28,772
Meaning, of course,
we are now lost at sea.

105
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:31,441
And will... slowly... die.

106
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:32,484
[thud]

107
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:33,610
[SAILOR E]
The cook fainted!

108
00:07:33,693 --> 00:07:36,488
[SAILOR F]
Dammit! No more food!

109
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:37,655
[splash]

110
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:39,324
Looks like the commodore
fell into the sea.

111
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:40,825
This is the Grand Line!

112
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,702
Did he decide to drown
himself and leave us

113
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:44,079
to our fates?

114
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:46,289
Maybe he decided on a
quick death over starvation.

115
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:48,667
Don't be stupid!
The commodore is a great man!

116
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,211
He's already returned
twice from these waters!

117
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:53,088
[SAILOR F] Yeah!
What are these carefully folded

118
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:54,506
clothes and shoes here for?

119
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,966
[SAILOR E]
Hey, someone go check.

120
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,051
[SAILOR D]
Screw that!

121
00:07:58,134 --> 00:08:00,136
This sea is chock
full of monsters!

122
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,596
[SAILOR F]
He's not coming up.

123
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:03,807
[SAILOR]
Commodore!

124
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,724
[SAILORS gasp]

125
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:06,351
[NOLAND]
He was a crafty one.

126
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:07,352
Here.

127
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:08,937
[SAILOR E]
Uh, what's the rope for?

128
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,023
[NOLAND]
Haul it in, boys.

129
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:15,276
[SAILORS grunt]

130
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,820
[SAILOR G]
Whoa! What is that thing?

131
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:19,155
[SAILOR H] Commodore, did you
kill that beast underwater?

132
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:21,199
[NOLAND]
Cook it up for us.

133
00:08:21,282 --> 00:08:23,576
I've been gettin' lazy. Man.

134
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,328
Must be losin' my touch.

135
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:31,084
[SAILOR H] This storm's a
real whopper, Commodore!

136
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,669
[NOLAND]
Ah, I've been through worse.

137
00:08:32,752 --> 00:08:34,796
[SAILOR H]
What? How does that help us?

138
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:37,966
[SAILOR I]
The yardarm's been broken off!

139
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:38,758
[SAILOR J]
Where?

140
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:40,010
[SAILOR I]
Main! Main!

141
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:42,303
[NOLAND] This third voyage
has kept us at sea

142
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,264
for over two years.

143
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:47,267
And it's a miracle
we've lasted this long.

144
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:52,313
Huh? Hey, did anybody
else hear that?

145
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:54,983
[SAILOR K]
Hear what? You mean the thunder?

146
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:57,068
[NOLAND]
No, it's something else.

147
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:59,779
Something beautiful,
like a bell.

148
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:05,035
[WARRIOR A]
Priest! Are you certain of this?

149
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:07,037
[PRIEST]
This land is cursed!

150
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,248
At this rate, the Shandorians
will be wiped out!

151
00:09:10,331 --> 00:09:13,918
[WARRIOR B] Then what can we
do to save the village, Priest?

152
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:16,588
We must offer another girl.

153
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:18,089
[gasps]

154
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:21,092
At the sacrificial altar!

155
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:31,394
Too much death. How many now?

156
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:36,149
Well over a hundred.

157
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:37,525
How can this be?

158
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:40,236
Nothing like this
has ever happened to us.

159
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:46,576
If I can help save the village,

160
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:49,037
then I will gladly
sacrifice my life.

161
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,831
[MOTHER crying]

162
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:53,792
Why do you cry? Mother.

163
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:56,753
It is truly an honor

164
00:09:56,836 --> 00:10:00,340
to be chosen as sacrifice
and embraced by the Sun God.

165
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:02,676
Today is a proud
and happy day for me,

166
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,969
and it should be
for you as well.

167
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:08,056
[MOTHER crying]

168
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:10,392
Thank you so much
for raising me right

169
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,352
these many years, Mama.

170
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:13,812
[MOTHER]
Mousse!

171
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:21,861
[SETO] If this is a bad dream,
let me wake up!

172
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:25,657
Get off of me! [grunts]
Get off!

173
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,409
Go away!

174
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:29,077
[crying]

175
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,415
Great Warrior Kalgara.

176
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:35,208
Seto.

177
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:39,170
[SETO] I wanted to grow up
to be just like you someday.

178
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:43,008
I wanted to be a brave warrior
and fight to protect this land!

179
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,219
[crying]

180
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:49,055
I don't wanna die from
something like this!

181
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:51,725
[SETO crying]

182
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,272
[SAILOR L]
You're amazing, Commodore!

183
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:59,149
We took the heading you said to,

184
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:01,276
and sure enough,
there's an island!

185
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,736
[NOLAND]
Yes, how fortunate.

186
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:05,155
We can ride out the storm here.

187
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:07,490
Still, you sure none
of you guys heard it?

188
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:08,783
[SAILOR L]
Nope.

189
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,744
None of us heard any bells.
Isn't that right?

190
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:11,911
[SAILOR M]
Yeah!

191
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:13,747
You must've been hearing
things, Commodore.

192
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:22,964
That's quite a forest.

193
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:26,760
[SAILOR N] I hope we find
stuff to help our research.

194
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,514
[SOUTHBIRD calls]

195
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:34,309
[SAILORS laughing]

196
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:36,770
[SAILOR O] Hey, Commodore!
There's your bell!

197
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:38,396
[NOLAND]
All right, enough, boys.

198
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,689
No need to tease.

199
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:41,358
[SAILORS laughing]

200
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:44,986
Do you really think I'd mistake
that freak bird call for a bell?

201
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,821
[bell rings]

202
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:48,531
Wait, Commodore. Did you...?

203
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,830
[bell rings]

204
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:13,056
It's unreal.
It has such a beautiful tone.

205
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,474
[bell rings]

206
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:16,768
Seems there are
people here after all.

207
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,064
Hey, Commodore, slow down!
Wait for us!

208
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:27,404
[NOLAND]
Someone's collapsed over here!

209
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:29,489
[SETO]
Intruders.

210
00:12:29,572 --> 00:12:31,741
[coughs]

211
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:33,076
Hey! You there!

212
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,577
[SAILOR L]
Commodore!

213
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:35,995
He doesn't look right!

214
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:39,040
[SAILOR L]
Get back here!

215
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,711
Let me go!

216
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,212
[coughs]

217
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:45,964
It's a plague called
"tree fever."

218
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:48,008
From the looks of him,
he hasn't been treated.

219
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:50,552
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!

220
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:52,554
Doctor, check our Conine stores.

221
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:55,807
Administer doses to this young
man and the crew immediately.

222
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:03,148
[NOLAND]
This is terrible.

223
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:05,483
Even the crops are
being eaten away.

[SAILOR P panting]

225
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:11,614

The whole village is infected!

[tribal music]

00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,353
[CLERIC]
Bring the girl to the altar!

228
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:54,866
[CLERIC]
God of the sun!

229
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:56,326
God of the rain!

230
00:13:58,286 --> 00:14:00,330
God of the forest!

231
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:01,998
God of the earth!

232
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,461
In exchange for
this girl's life,

233
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:08,046
we beseech you.

234
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:09,756
Spare our village!

235
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,232
It's the Kashi God!

00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:33,822
Mousse!

237
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:36,324
For the village. Let her go!

238
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,784
[VILLAGER D]
The Kashi God.

239
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,703
Such a divine form!

240
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:43,540
Please save my mother.

241
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:46,501
Please save my son.

242
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,378
And spare my father.

243
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:52,132
What's that? Something fell in!

244
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:53,341
Fell in?

00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,484
[VILLAGERS gasp]

246
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:12,736
Wh-What just happened?

247
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:13,987
Who is that?

248
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,321
Kashi, no!

249
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:16,614
[VILLAGER K]
He's killed a God!

250
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,450
[VILLAGERS chattering]

251
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:25,206
[NOLAND]
The ceremony is over.

252
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,916
You must've been frightened.

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,376
But you're safe now.

254
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,295
There's no need to die.

255
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:33,673
[MOUSSE crying]

256
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:35,717
[VILLAGER L]
Kashi, please forgive us!

257
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,177
[VILLAGER M]
We're all going to be cursed!

258
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,261
[VILLAGER N]
Kill them both!

259
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:40,263
Offer the gods more lives

260
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:42,849
before we incur their wrath!

261
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:44,684
[VILLAGER O]
Kalgara! Kill them!

262
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:47,228
[SAILOR Q] The commodore's
gone and done it this time!

263
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:49,147
They sound really mad!

264
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,649
[SAILOR R] That guy can't
just keep to himself!

265
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,068
[SAILOR S]
He killed a god?

266
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:54,652
What does that mean?

267
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:58,281
[SAILOR T] Tribal rituals ain't
something you mess around with!

268
00:15:58,365 --> 00:16:01,493
[VILLAGER P] Quell the gods'
anger, Great Warrior Kalgara!

269
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:03,745
I am an explorer
from the North Blue!

270
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:05,121
Commodore Montblanc Nol--

271
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:07,457
[KALGARA] I don't care
who you are, outsider!

272
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,293
You must be eliminated!

273
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:12,504
Eliminated? Is that your answer?

274
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:15,256
You just destroy all
manner of progress?

275
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,676
You have no right
to impose your values!

276
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,719
Now. Say goodbye!

277
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:21,971
Who is this guy?

278
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:24,140
He's holding his own
against Kalgara!

279
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:31,731
[KALGARA]
Girl!

280
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:34,526
Use that blade to give
your life to the gods!

281
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,654
Do what?

282
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:40,323
A sacrifice meant to
save the entire village,

283
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:42,242
weeping because
she wants to live?

284
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:43,743
Disgraceful!

285
00:16:47,664 --> 00:16:49,207
Don't be a fool!

286
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,002
Stop!

[SAILORS muttering]

292
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,651
For centuries, our people
have strictly upheld

293
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,069
the sacred commandment--

294
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:20,739
that all intruders on
this island must be punished.

295
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:23,033
And you have commited
the unforgivable sin

296
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:24,451
of slaughtering Kashi.

297
00:17:24,534 --> 00:17:26,202
You alone cannot atone for that.

298
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:29,539
You and all your men
will pay with your lives!

299
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:31,207
"Sacrifices" this.

300
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,459
"Lives" that.

301
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:33,668
It's insane!

302
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,004
How does that make
your gods happy?

303
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:38,757
These ceremonies are
flat-out denials of the triumphs

304
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,092
of all great men before us.

305
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:43,136
I won't stand for it!

306
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:45,972
You insult every
adventurer and researcher

307
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:49,142
who's ever set out to sea in
hopes of bringing prosperity

308
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:50,894
to mankind!

309
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:52,896
How shameful!

310
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:55,732
If your gods value your lives,

311
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:59,277
wouldn't they have contempt
for these very ceremonies?

312
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:05,658
Give me some time, people.

313
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:08,953
Your so-called curse?

314
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:11,164
I will lift it for good.

315
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:12,832
And if I cannot...

316
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,835
You may do what you
will with my crew and I.

317
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,295
[VILLAGERS yelling]

318
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:19,756
[VILLAGER R] What nonsense!
Do you think you're a god?

00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,966
[VILLAGERS yelling]

320
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,677
And in return...

321
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,680
If I do save this
village from tragedy...

322
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:30,392
You must swear never to
perform this ceremony again!

323
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:32,852
Is that all you have to say?

324
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:35,980
Ridiculous!
Now prepare to die!

325
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:37,565
[ELDER]
Let him try!

326
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:39,818
What're you saying?

327
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:40,944
Chief, no!

328
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:44,447
You will have until
sundown tomorrow.

329
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:46,574
When your crew will die.

330
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,451
I accept your terms.

331
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:52,789
[SAILOR L]
Aww...

332
00:18:52,872 --> 00:18:55,959
Well, fellas, come sunset
tomorrow, it looks like

333
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:58,169
it's "goodbye world" for us!

00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:00,672
[DOCTOR]
Have faith in the commodore.

336
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:02,090
[SAILOR M]
Hey, pretty lady!

337
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:05,969
I feel bad for you too.
It's a shame you were born here.

338
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:08,013
[SAILOR N] Yeah! With your
looks, you could've married

339
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:09,973
an aristocrat and
lived the good life!

340
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:11,141
[SAILOR O]
Knock it off, guys!

341
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:12,726
Learn a little tact!

342
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,269
Who is he?

343
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:17,355
Huh? Who?
You mean the commodore?

344
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:19,691
His name is Montblanc Noland.

345
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:22,360
He's a rather famous explorer.

346
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:24,029
He's also a skilled botanist.

347
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:26,239
He explores uncharted
islands and documents

348
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:28,992
new species of plants
for his research.

349
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:31,619
He's pretty much
a hero in our country.

350
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,872
But he's way too nice a guy!

351
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:37,208
Yeah, it's impossible for him
to ignore a situation like this!

352
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:39,085
We know we can trust him though!

353
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:40,462
[laughing]

354
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:45,008
[WARRIOR H] Why did you not
let Kalgara kill him right then?

355
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:47,886
[ELDER] The answer will
make itself known tomorrow.

356
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:50,180
He says he can save our village.

357
00:19:50,263 --> 00:19:52,557
There is no harm in waiting.

358
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,267
[WARRIOR I]
How can you be so sure?

359
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:56,269
[WARRIOR J] You'll listen to
him, but not the shaman's

360
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:58,563
dying words?

361
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:02,400
Kalgara! Please say something
about this outrage!

362
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:05,487
If I sense that the village is
in even the slightest danger,

363
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,781
I will not hesitate to
take that man's head

364
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:10,867
before sunset tomorrow.

365
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,871
I may not have the power
to hear the words of the gods.

366
00:20:14,954 --> 00:20:16,498
However...

367
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:21,711
I can hear the words of a man
who speaks in earnest.

368
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:23,672
Now, that is all.

369
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:24,756
[KALGARA]
Hmph.

370
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:29,928
What are you still doing awake?

371
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:32,472
[SETO]
I'm all better.

372
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:37,435
Great Warrior Kalgara.

373
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,313
What did he mean? By "progress?"

374
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:53,034
[NOLAND]
Here we are! A Cona tree!

375
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,078
I knew there had to be one.

376
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:56,913
In a forest this huge?

377
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,293
[MOUSSE gasps]

378
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:04,587
[VILLAGER T]
Earthquake!

379
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:05,755
[VILLAGER U]
It's here!

380
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,133
Kashi's wrath has finally come!

381
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:11,845
[SAILORS yelling]

382
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:14,305
Let us out of here, please!

383
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,028
[KALGARA]
Such devastation.

384
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:30,280
The forest floor has sunk.

385
00:21:30,363 --> 00:21:33,241
It looks as if the island
is tearing itself apart.

386
00:21:40,874 --> 00:21:43,460
[KALGARA chuckles]
You're looking well.

387
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:46,880
I suppose the gods
have taken your punishment

388
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:49,341
into their own divine hands.

389
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:51,259
[NOLAND chuckles]

390
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,678
Then your gods...

391
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:55,180
...have grown weak.

392
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:56,681
They lack...

393
00:21:56,765 --> 00:22:01,186
...the strength to kill
even one lowly explorer.

394
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:04,147
[grunting]

395
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,024
[KALGARA]
Stubborn fool!

396
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:08,943
Sorry, but would
you mind leaving?

397
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:12,489
I don't feel like
looking at you.

398
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:16,076
I have to...
hurry to the village.

399
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,911
How amusing.

400
00:22:17,994 --> 00:22:20,121
I'll enjoy watching this.

401
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,956
Go ahead and squirm!

402
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:31,716
<i>When you're lost and alone,</i>
<i>I can always hear your voice</i>

403
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,888
<i>While you wander far from home,</i>
<i>gazing up at the sky</i>

404
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:39,641
<i>You are just like the moon</i>

405
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:44,437
<i>You never change as</i>
<i>you climb into the night</i>

406
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:52,904
<i>But your reflection wanes,</i>
<i>then you disappear,</i>

407
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:56,908
<i>fading so suddenly...</i>

408
00:22:56,991 --> 00:23:02,163
<i>Stay as you are,</i>
<i>don't lose your way</i>

409
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:11,089
<i>Let these words guide you,</i>
<i>don't ever look back!</i>

410
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>Don't give up on your dreams,</i>
<i>through endless nights</i>

411
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,303
<i>they come to you</i>

412
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:22,767
<i>Again and again, until you</i>
<i>see them shining through!</i>

413
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:28,648
<i>You may not return,</i>
<i>I hope that you'll learn</i>

414
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:35,363
<i>to put your past behind,</i>
<i>and just keep moving on</i>

415
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:42,662
[KALGARA]
How unsightly!

416
00:23:42,746 --> 00:23:46,541
Is this wreck of a man the
same who defied the gods?

417
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:48,877
[NOLAND] Will you let your
village die by curse,

418
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,211
or by disease?

419
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,589
Are you that
afraid of your gods?

420
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:53,923
[KALGARA]
You understand nothing!

421
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:55,925
[NOLAND]
However great your gods are,

422
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:58,470
people's lives are
even more precious!

423
00:23:58,553 --> 00:24:00,430
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

424
00:24:00,513 --> 00:24:04,017
"Free from the Spell!
The Great Warrior Sheds Tears!"

425
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,644
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
