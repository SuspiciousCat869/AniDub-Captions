347
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,561
I don't get it.
Why's she running?

348
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,163
[LUFFY]
She said to set sail.

349
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,364
What?

350
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,701
No, she's planning on
leaving us without letting

351
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,170
any of us thank her
or say goodbye.

352
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,304
Hey, wait!

353
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,073
[LUFFY]
Set sail

354
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,380
[VILLAGER A]
Wait! Don't go!

355
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,348
[VILLAGER B]
They're leaving!

356
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,017
[DOCTOR] Stop! At least
let us say goodbye!

357
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,087
[VILLAGER A]
Nami, don't!

358
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,222
[VILLAGER B]
Let us thank you!

359
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,094
Nami! Come back here
you can't leave this way!

360
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,097
So, you sure you want
to let her leave like this?

361
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,498
Not my decision.

362
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,433
She does what she wants.

363
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,519
Nami!

364
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,463
Why?!

365
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,653
Huh?! No way!

366
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,754
[VILLAGER A]
Hey, where's my money?!

367
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:23,889
[VILLAGER B]
My wallet's gone!

368
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,123
[VILLAGER C]
Mine, too!

369
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,558
[VILALGER D]
She stole my money!

370
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,127
[VILLAGER AA]
My purse is gone!

371
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,665
Thanks a bunch!

372
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:37,603
Damn! You little brat!

373
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,574
Great, she hasn't
changed a bit.

374
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,409
I'd watch my back.

375
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:48,680
[LUFFY, SANJI laughing]

376
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,151
[GENZO] You lousy pickpocket!
We'll miss you!

377
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,359
[LUFFY laughing]

378
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,527
[GENZO]
Boy!

379
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,430
Remember what I told you.

380
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,001
[LUFFY]
You got it!

381
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:14,172
[NAMI] Goodbye everybody!
I'll miss you. Take care.

382
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,376
[NOJIKO laughing]
I can't believe her!

383
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:21,446
My little sister got
us good with that one.

384
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,215
Be safe, Nami.

385
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,818
[GENZO laughs]

386
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,553
[DOCTOR]
Take a look at this.

387
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,190
[GENZO]
What is it Doc... Nami's bill?

388
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:35,460
[DOCTOR] Not exactly.
That girl will never change.

389
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,229
That's her new tattoo.

390
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,730
[GENZO]
What's it supposed to be?

391
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,800
[DOCTOR] A tangerine...
and a pinwheel.

392
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,237
Hey, Genzo.

393
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,539
Where's your pinwheel?

394
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,413
[GENZO laughs]
I don't need it anymore.

395
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,359
[NAMI]
I'm off.

396
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:13,432
[baby cries]

397
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,902
[BELLEMERE] Genzo, back off.
Don't get so close to Nami.

398
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,871
[GENZO]
I just wanted to see her smile.

399
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,942
[BELLEMERE] Your face is
too scary. It's making her cry.

400
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,346
[GENZO] I can't change
my face... Oh, wait...

401
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,415
I'll keep this on my
hat to distract her.

402
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,951
What do ya think little girl?

403
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,519
[BELLEMERE]
You're joking, right?

404
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,854
It's just a stupid pinwheel.

405
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,356
There's no way it's
going to make her‐‐

406
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,926
[laughing]

407
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:48,300
[BELLEMERE] I can't believe it.
She's laughing.

408
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,752
<i>♪All that's in my heart</i>

409
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,754

00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,625

00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,445

Oh, no!

431
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,691
[SANJI]
What's the matter?

432
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,560
[NAMI] The newspaper's
gone up in price.

433
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,994
[USOPP]
What kind of problem is that?

434
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,062
[ZORO]
Then don't buy it.

435
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,063
[NAMI]
What'd you mean?

436
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,065
We have to know what's
going on in the world.

437
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,634
Plus we can use the back
of the flyers to draw on.

438
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:30,669
[LUFFY]
Good thinking!

439
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:31,970
[NAMI]
See... like this.

What?! This is‐‐
