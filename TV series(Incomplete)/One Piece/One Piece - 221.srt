1
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,383
Who're you?

2
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,351
Huh?

3
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,286
Oh, who're those two?

4
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,655
Are they part of your
giant pirate crew, Captain?

5
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,158
Hm? Yeah, that's it!

6
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,460
Don't tell me you
lost your memories, too?

7
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,797
Enchanté, gorgeous
ladies! I'm Sanji.

8
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,432
What's that thing?

9
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,399
A deer.

10
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:15,102
Shut your pie hole,
human! I'm a reindeer!

11
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,636
It just talked!

12
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,575
[NAMI] Pirate this,
pirate that, who cares?

13
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,643
I hate pirates!

14
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,712
Every stinking
last one of them!

15
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,647
So why would
I be on this ship?!

16
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,083
The only things I love
are money and tangerines

17
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:31,284
and I don't see
either around here!

18
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:35,456
It's a little early
for this much of a racket.

19
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,291
I was trying to sleep.

20
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,759
[NAMI] There's gotta be
some way off this ship.

21
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,600
Hmph.

22
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,569
[thinking] I don't know
what's goin' on here.

23
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,271
But I don't see any
point in sticking around.

24
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,751
[ROBIN]
Our navigator.

25
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,122
Hmph!

26
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,324
[USOPP] I guess I can
postpone that heart attack.

27
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,192
[SANJI] Not that I'm
sad to see that guy go,

28
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,461
but we're losin'
people left and right.

29
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,797
Our navigator's likely
headed for the island.

30
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,532
I doubt she'll go too far.

31
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,267
She won't do anything drastic.

32
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,536
Not until she thinks
things through, anyway.

33
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,170
Let's hope so.

34
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,809
I'm starvin' to death here!

35
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,244
Aaah!

36
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,445
[LUFFY]
You look delicious!

37
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:32,579
What?!

38
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:36,216
Geez, you've really got a
one track mind, don't you?

39
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,250
Hm?

40
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:38,752
[SANJI]
Oh, well.

41
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,121
I guess we can try to
figure out just what the hell

42
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,290
is going on here
while we're eating.

43
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,224
But first things first,

44
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,594
I'm afraid I never
caught your name, Miss.

45
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,696
Eh-heh! It's Nico Robin.

46
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,265
Despite the circumstances,
it's a pleasure.

47
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,601
Can you fill us
in on our history?

48
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,069
Sure.

49
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:58,605
[roaring engine]

50
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,509
[thinking]
There's no way in hell!

51
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,545
I wouldn't be caught
dead on that ship!

52
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,746
The only thing
pirates are good for

53
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,182
is destroying
other people's lives.

54
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,050
I've gotta figure
out some way

55
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,352
to get back to
Cocoyashi Village.

56
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,165
[DRIM]
Come on ashore, lady.

57
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,768
I'm glad that you've
wandered my way.

58
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,203
Very glad indeed.

59
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,482
I haven't seen a single person.

60
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,383
It's a little creepy.

61
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:49,222
[NAMI] Maybe I'll find someone
a little further up the hill.

62
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,205
A news bird?

63
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:07,607
Huh?

64
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,743
What the?!

65
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,214
What do you people want?!

66
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,119
[NAMI shrieks]

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,488
[ISLANDER A]
It's mine, dammit!

68
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,157
[ISLANDER B] Shut up! It's
the only thing I can rely on!

69
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,159
[ISLANDER C]
Well too bad for you, then!

70
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,760
[ISLANDER D]
Let go, jerk!

71
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,362
[ISLANDER E] I need
it more than you do!

72
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,730
[ISLANDER F] Shut up, it's mine!

73
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,699
[FEMALE ISLANDER G]
I had it first, now drop it!

74
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:32,733
[ISLANDER H]
Do I look like I care?

75
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:33,934
[FEMALE ISLANDER G]
Who do you think you are?!

76
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:36,470
[ISLANDER H] If I knew that,
there wouldn't be a problem!

77
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,639
What is wrong
with these people?

78
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,642
[crying baby]

79
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,215
What was that about?

80
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:48,749
[DRIM]
Hey.

81
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,317
Hm?

82
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,089
You look perplexed.
What's the matter?

83
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,594
Hmm... So that's it?
You need a boat?

84
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:01,395
[NAMI]
Yeah.

85
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,563
[DRIM]
The boats docked behind us

86
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,598
are the only ones on the island.

87
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,333
What? Are you sure?

88
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,501
They all look pretty run-down,

89
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,736
like no one's used
them in forever.

90
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,406
I guess everyone
around here's too busy

91
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,675
with other things
to bother with them.

92
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,477
You can go ahead and
check the rest of the island

93
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,112
if you don't believe me.

94
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:21,715
It's a small island,
it won't take you long at all.

95
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:24,285
You ought'a stick
around for a while.

96
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:27,288
Might as well take it
easy and enjoy yourself.

97
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:30,224
[NAMI] Well, I'd like to but
I really need to get going.

98
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,226
[DRIM]
Oh, that's too bad.

99
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,160
[NAMI]
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,596
[DRIM] It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

101
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,131
[yawns]

102
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,666
Well I'm feelin'
kinda worn out.

103
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,700
I better head on home.

104
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:42,703
[NAMI]
Hang on!

105
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,471
[DRIM]
Bye! See ya!

106
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,349
[CHOPPER thinking] I can't
believe I'm stuck on a boat

107
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,284
with real pirates!

108
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,820
[LUFFY] So clouds are
really as fluffy as they look?

109
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:04,258
Daaaaachsund dog,
horsey-bird, darn it!

110
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,493
I wanna remember
all this stuff!

111
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,730
[SANJI] A Davy Back Fight
and a Marine Fortress.

112
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,232
Sky islands and sand countries.

113
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,635
Talk about a
fantastic adventure.

114
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:15,769
And this is true?

115
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,705
Yes, all true.

116
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:18,672
Huh...

117
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:19,740
[USOPP thinking]
I'm sitting next to a pirate

118
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,744
with a hundred million
berry bounty on his head.

119
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,046
[LUFFY] Hey. Don't ya
got any more stories

120
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,648
about all our neat adventures?

121
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,718
[ROBIN] I didn't join your crew
until after you left Alabasta.

122
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:33,621
Sorry, I couldn't tell you
what happened before that.

123
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,189
Aw, man, that sucks.

124
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,262
[thinking] Can't really say
I buy every aspect of her story

125
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,530
but she's got one piece
of evidence on her side.

126
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,567
This is exactly how
I would've set this kitchen up.

127
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,103
So Robin, can you
tell us about yesterday,

128
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,771
before any of this happened?

129
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,241
Sure, but let's include
the ship's doctor.

130
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,315
[ROBIN] You're still
doing it backwards.

131
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,250
[CHOPPER] Shut up!
I'll do it how I want!

132
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,418
[SANJI]
You've gotta be hungry.

133
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,353
Why don't you
sit down and eat?

134
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:08,322
Oh, come on!
Do I look stupid to you?

135
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,524
You really think I'm gonna
fall for something like that?!

136
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,327
This conversation is
nothing without your voice.

137
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,528
Please join us.

138
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,696
We need your brilliant input.

139
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:17,964
You dummy!

140
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,068
You're not gonna win me
over by flattering me, okay?

141
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,370
You sure about that?

142
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,371
[ROBIN] We followed
the coordinates

143
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,774
to this area of the sea.

144
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:27,975
[ZORO yawns]

145
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,744
[ZORO] Nami, are you sure
we haven't veered off course?

146
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,647
[NAMI] Calm down, the
log pose is never wrong.

147
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,283
Hey, Usopp! What's the
lookout like up there?

148
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,485
Uh, Gimme a second.

149
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,421
Island ahead!

150
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,193
It looks like its completely
surrounded by coral reefs.

151
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,395
It's dangerous to
push ahead in this light.

152
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,130
Why don't we drop
anchor off the coast tonight

153
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,799
and go ashore
in the morning?

154
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,434
Aw!

155
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,669
[NAMI] Don't wanna listen
to your navigator, huh?

156
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,771
Hey Sanji, no
dinner for Luffy.

157
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:58,505
[LUFFY]
What?!

158
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,341
[SANJI]
Whatever you say, Nami!

159
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,775
[LUFFY]
I'm sorry!

160
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,178
[ROBIN] And after that,
everybody went to bed.

161
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,679
Well, I stayed
up doing research

162
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,048
and the swordsman
was on watch.

163
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,653
I know it's not
much, but that's it.

164
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:13,587
Everything's the same

165
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,824
as you remember it
after that, probably.

166
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,025
[SANJI]
The pirate hunter was pissed

167
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,428
we woke him up so he must've
fallen asleep at some point.

168
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,430
It would seem so.

169
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,598
More coffee?

170
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,034
Yes, please.

171
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,569
[SANJI] So the big
question we need to answer

172
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:31,505
is why you're the only one
who didn't lose your memory.

173
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,574
The only difference
that I can think of

174
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,542
is that I'm the only
one who stayed awake.

175
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,245
If the swordsman did in
fact fall asleep, that is.

176
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,379
Uh, well, I fell asleep,

177
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,483
but I still remember that
we are the Usopp Pirates!

178
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,652
Good point, sounds
like it all boils down

179
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,587
to whether we
were asleep or not.

180
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,156
I'm just pointing out
the obvious factors.

181
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,591
It could be a coincidence.

182
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,393
[CHOPPER] I've never
heard of such a case.

183
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,094
I don't know what to think.

184
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,596
Well now that I've
told you what happened

185
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,131
let's hear your story.

186
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,565
Why don't you tell us
what you think happened

187
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,534
to you yesterday?

188
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,770
[CHOPPER] I'm pretty sure that
I went to pick medicinal herbs

189
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,439
with Doctorine and then
I went back to the castle

190
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,808
and went to bed
and woke up here.

191
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,176
Well, I'm, being ignored.

192
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,379
I blacked out after
getting swallowed up

193
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,816
by a giant whirlpool
and then I was here.

194
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:16,883
Same as these guys.

195
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,386
I remember going to sleep
in my room after work

196
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,255
but then I woke up here.

197
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,724
And none of you remember
anything after that?

198
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,759
Fweeee!!

199
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:27,995
Huh?

200
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,230
[CHOPPER] That's right!
There was a horn!

201
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,466
I remember hearing
someone blow on a horn!

202
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,435
Same here!
Yeah, a horn!

203
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,803
I heard the same thing!

204
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:36,937
Yeah, me too.

205
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:40,774
And then, a little boy suddenly
appeared out of nowhere.

206
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,147
Hang on, I don't think
we lost our memories.

207
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,050
I get the feeling that kid
somehow stole them from us.

208
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,652
Well we don't
know that just yet

209
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,121
but I'm willing to bet
this child is the answer

210
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,656
to our situation.

211
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:56,723
[CHOPPER] Do you
think it's possible

212
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,660
we'll lose more memories
each time we fall asleep?

213
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,161
[USOPP]
Aaaah!

214
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,496
Don't scare me like that!

215
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,132
Look, I mean this was
just a dream, right?

216
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,534
That supernatural kind
of mumbo-jumbo isn't real!

217
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,304
[SANJI] You don't think it's
weird we all had the same dream?

218
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,506
Supernatural or
not, it happened.

219
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,774
Look, I don't
mean to scare you,

220
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,610
but if this keeps happening, it
could eventually reach a point

221
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,512
where you're incapable of
remembering who you are.

222
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,049
[USOPP]
Nope, still scared.

223
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,352
[LUFFY]
Say, why's it such a big deal

224
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,754
if we remember
those things or not?

225
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:27,688
[SANJI]
Huh?

226
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,556
You know, sure,
it sucks that I don't have

227
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,792
all those fun
memories anymore

228
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,094
but it's a pretty good
reason for us to start over

229
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,663
and go on new fun adventures!

230
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,364
[USOPP]
What?! Are you crazy?!

231
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:40,200
There's a serious chance we
could lose all of our memories!

232
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,502
You really wanna
lose all your thoughts

233
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,670
and dreams and everything?!

234
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,305
None of that's gonna happen.

235
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:46,574
Nothin' can take
away my dreams.

236
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:49,309
And I know it's the
same for you guys too.

237
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,680
[thinking] This guy is
freakishly optimistic.

238
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,149
[thinking]
Same old captain.

239
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:58,385
Doesn't even need his
memories to know who he is.

240
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,654
[thinking]
I kind of find him inspiring.

241
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,123
Ahhh! My food's gone!

242
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,630
Don't mess with another
man's food. Got it?

243
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:10,697
[LUFFY]
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,300
[thinking] There's a good
chance that he's crazy,

245
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,536
so I'm the stupid one
for taking him seriously.

246
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:18,738
He he!

247
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,381
All right, where
the hell's the town?

248
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:48,502
[LUFFY chuckles]

249
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,403
This is kind of exciting.

250
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:52,238
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

251
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,041
What's that 'cher makin' there?

252
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,277
It's a medicine for
regaining memories.

253
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,512
No, don't interfere.

254
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,047
Find anything useful?

255
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,416
No, nothing suggests
that it's anything

256
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,484
but a normal island.

257
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,452
[USOPP]
All right, finally done!

258
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,121
[chuckles]

259
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,156
This is my greatest
invention yet.

260
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,424
Then I'm sure
it's amazing.

261
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:14,528
[USOPP] Yep! You called it,
my friend. Behold!

262
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,130
Thanks to me,
it doesn't even matter

263
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,498
if we lose our memories!

264
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:21,335
I call them, identity boards!

265
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,037
Ha ha ha! Great idea.

266
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,072
A question mark?
That's just rude!

267
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,374
I am not an
emergency food source!

268
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,742
What's with the hearts on mine?

269
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:32,279
Yep, now we'll always
know who we are. Cool, huh?

270
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,547
[smacking sound]

271
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:36,349
[SANJI] Don't waste your
time on stupid stuff.

272
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,386
[ZORO] So I'm missing
some memories, huh?

273
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,122
[DOJO MASTER] It may appear
otherwise to the blind eye,

274
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,125
but people are
quite fragile things.

275
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:50,363
Zoro.

276
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,735
[KUINA]
You're lucky Zoro.

277
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,804
Being born as a man.

278
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:57,705
All I ever wanted was

279
00:13:57,738 --> 00:14:00,507
to be the world's
greatest swordsman.

280
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,809
When girls grow up,

281
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,377
it's natural
for us to develop

282
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,412
into physically
weaker beings than men.

283
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:06,780
It's just so frustrating!

284
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,350
If only, if I had
just been born a man!

285
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:12,453
Don't go whining like
that after you beat me!

286
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,054
Because it's not fair!

287
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,489
You're my goal!

288
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,023
Zoro.

289
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:16,990
Boy this, girl that.

290
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,126
Are you gonna keep up
that same kinda talk

291
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,794
after I beat you some day?

292
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,229
Like skill is irrelevant!

293
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,797
That's an insult to
all of the training

294
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,333
I've been pouring on every day.

295
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,401
It's crap!

296
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:28,569
Now promise me.

297
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:29,670
Promise me that someday

298
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,307
one of us will be the
world's greatest swordsman.

299
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,709
We'll compete and
see who gets there.

300
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,680
Dummy, you're so weak.

301
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,518
[BOTH]
It's a promise.

302
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,353
Sensei.

303
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,757
I ask of you that you
let me have that sword.

304
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,458
Her sword? Kuina's?

305
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,425
That's right.

306
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,095
I'm gonna get stronger
than she ever was!!

307
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:58,132
Strong enough that my
name reaches up to Heaven!

308
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:00,768
I am going to be the
world's greatest swordsman!

309
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:04,705
I promised her. I promised.

310
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,240
I did.

311
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,374
[sobs]

312
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,043
[DOJO MASTER]
Yes. The sword is yours.

313
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:24,558
[DOJO MASTER] I leave her spirit
and her dreams in your hands.

314
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,559
[thinking] I trained
every day after that

315
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,829
until I set out to sea
in search of that man.

316
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:31,298
And that's the last I remember.

317
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,268
Falling asleep shortly
after getting on a boat.

318
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:38,105
And after that, it's like
nothing else ever happened.

319
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,574
And the weirdest thing
about it is these swords.

320
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,544
I have no idea
how I got these two.

321
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:46,280
But they feel so
familiar somehow.

322
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,281
None of this makes sense.

323
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,184
Hey, who's back there?

324
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,067
[thinking] The last date
recorded in the logbook

325
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,703
is the day before the
date on the newspaper.

326
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,639
Which means
it's current but...

327
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,381
...how am I supposed
to believe this?

328
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:23,316
Everything she
said, if it's true.

329
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:28,489
That would make
me a pirate. Me!

330
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:32,359
I can't be. There's
no way that it's true.

331
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:36,830
But then this tattoo,
what happened to it?

332
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,568
I don't know
what's going on!

333
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:42,369
I'm so confused.

334
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,405
[ARLONG]
Hahahaha!

335
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:48,075
Greetings and salutations
you pathetic little humans.

336
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,277
From this moment
on this entire island

337
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,213
and its inhabitants
are a part of my domain.

338
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,715
Starting today,
every one of you

339
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,483
will pay me for your lives.

340
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,686
Those who cannot
pay will die.

341
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,254
No.

342
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:04,491
I don't want to.
Why do we have to leave?

343
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,162
I... I want to
stay in this village.

344
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,197
It's because we're poor.

345
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,566
That's why we
can't stay together.

346
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,402
Hold it!

347
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:17,404
[BELLEMERE]
That money I gave up was

348
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:21,741
for my two daughters
but I can't pay you.

349
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,078
Bellemere! You can't!

350
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,579
No, it'll be okay.

351
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:29,683
Really, I have to
do this for my family.

352
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,052
Even if it costs me my life.

353
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:34,421
[BELLEMERE] It's true
the three of us aren't

354
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:37,458
related by blood
but we're a family.

355
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:40,828
All I've ever wanted
was to be their mother.

356
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:44,464
And now, now, I can be.

357
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,735
Bellemere!

358
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,639
I wish, I could have been

359
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:54,742
a better mother to
the both of you girls.

360
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:55,776
Don't say that!

361
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,045
[NAMI] We don't need
anything, just don't die!

362
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,780
Nami...

363
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,683
Go and make your
dreams come true.

364
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,451
For me.

365
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,557
So, you ready to die, human?

366
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,059
Nojiko, Nami!

367
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,494
Uh... Ahh!

368
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,235
Love you.

369
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,336
[gunshot]

370
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:29,443
[NAMI]
I'm joining the Arlong pirates.

371
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,112
I'll get to be a
navigator and draw maps.

372
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,414
Nami.

373
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:34,682
[NAMI] I made a
deal with Arlong

374
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:36,784
to buy Cocoyashi
Village from him.

375
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:39,219
[NOJIKO]
Buy Cocoyashi? How?

376
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,322
[NAMI]
For 100 million berries.

377
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:43,123
[NOJIKO]
But 100 million berries!

378
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,492
You can't earn that
working your whole life.

379
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,261
[NAMI] I will get that
money no matter what.

380
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,199
If anyone tries to help
me they'll just get hurt.

381
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:57,137
Won't it be hard?

382
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,405
[NAMI]
Yeah.

383
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,574
You're gonna be living

384
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,309
with the people
who killed Bellemere.

385
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,044
It's gonna hurt.

386
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:06,046
[BELLEMERE]
Good things will come your way

387
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,549
as long as you continue to live.

388
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,251
[NAMI]
I'll be okay.

389
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:13,320
I'll just smile every
time I see his face.

390
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:16,190
I'm not going to cry anymore.

391
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,558
I'm going to fight by myself.

392
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,601
I miss her so much.

393
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,773
[DRIM]
This waiting is killing me.

394
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:35,743
I'll steal every
memory they have left.

395
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:41,014
Each and every one. Hahahahaha!

396
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,085
[SANJI]
Oh, man.

397
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,453
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I wake you?

398
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,254
No.

399
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,756
Go on back to
sleep if you want.

400
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,358
I'll wake you up if
I notice anything strange.

401
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,794
I'm okay but thanks
for keepin' a lookout.

402
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:56,430
How 'bout I brew some
coffee to help keep us up?

403
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:59,233
That sounds great.
I could sure use some.

404
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,502
Well he didn't waste
any damn time, did he?

405
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,104
And right after he swore
he wouldn't fall asleep.

406
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,573
[blowing horn music]

407
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,708
[door opening]

408
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,544
What are you two doing up?

409
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,413
Everyone here's
supposed to be asleep.

410
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:15,149
So you're the thief who
stole everyone's memories.

411
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:16,116
[DRIM chuckles]

412
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,318
I'm surprised you realized.

413
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:22,155
Not that you can
do anything about it.

414
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,596
Come on! Wake up!

415
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:31,231
Oh, you've got
mystical abilities.

416
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,066
Huh?

417
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:32,800
What?

418
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,134
Yaah!!

419
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:34,768
He's back!

420
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:35,803
Ahhh!

421
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:38,105
Is it already breakfast time?

422
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:39,440
That wasn't very nice.

423
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:41,275
You should've
just let them sleep.

424
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,043
I really didn't wanna
have to do this

425
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,646
but you've given
me no other choice.

you're doing up there?!

Huh?

[LUFFY] Who said
you could sit there?!

431
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:03,197
It's mine! I claimed
it earlier today!

432
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,033
Don't you dare sit there!

433
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,315
Sorry I took your seat.

00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:22,449

[SANJI] Hey, shouldn't
we do something for him?

[ROBIN]
He's not moving.

442
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,473
He's still alive isn't he?

443
