1
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,087
[FRANKY]
Huh?

2
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,154
Show yourself!

3
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:05,025
What fool would dare to
oppose the Franky Family?!

4
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,066
Give us our money back!

5
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,602
[FRANKY] "Give us our
money back," you say?

6
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:18,138
Hmm, does that mean
you're one of the Straw Hats?

7
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,141
That's right, bro!
He totally is!

8
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,811
I was expecting all of the Straw
Hat crew to be really strong,

9
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,379
but this one's not at all!

10
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,680
Hahahaha!

11
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,282
Yeah, he's a complete weakling!

12
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:28,949
What a joke!

13
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,384
Mind your own damn business!

14
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,656
[FRANKY]
Whoops!

15
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,458
You've got some guts
trying to take back

16
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,727
the money all by yourself.

17
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,395
But I'm afraid
I can't let you have it.

18
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,534
Give it back.

19
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,440
We need the money...

20
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:59,512
...to fix the Merry!

21
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,017
Her scars are deep.

22
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,222
That's our money.

23
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,125
It's to heal her wounds,
understand me?!

24
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:16,696
You can't have it!
Give it back to me right now!

25
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,638
[LUFFY]

26
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,777
[FRANKY]
Hahahaha!

27
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,347
What are you so
worked up about?

28
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,083
Seems like you love
your ship quite a bit.

29
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:38,686
[chuckles]

30
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,289
No matter.
Whatever condition she's in,

31
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:46,193
this money belongs
to us now. Understand?

32
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,595
Damn you.

33
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,496
[FRANKY]
Unfortunately, in this world,

34
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,399
stealing from pirates isn't
really seen as a crime.

35
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,268
Besides, this is
probably dirty money

36
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,604
you swiped somewhere
along the way here.

37
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,205
[chuckles]

38
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,106
Just let us have it.

39
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,212
[FRANKY] Maybe you could
beg the Navy for help.

40
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,314
Nah, they'd just arrest you.

41
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,583
[chuckles]

42
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,819
Too bad for Straw Hat Luffy.

43
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,787
He's got himself a
useless crony who can't even

44
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,757
handle the simple task
of guarding a little money.

45
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,592
Such a shame.

46
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,368
[FRANKY]
All right, boys!

47
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,769
Show him all the hospitalities

48
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,505
of The Franky House
while I'm gone.

49
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,574
No time like the present
to start shopping

50
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,442
with this pile of money.

51
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,077
[chuckles]

52
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,812
Man! This is gonna be great!

53
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,515
Hold it! Special
Attack Exploding Star!

54
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:49,990
[gasps]

55
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:54,595
[FRANKY] Remember my name,
long-nosed boy. It's Franky.

56
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,730
If you wanna leave
this city alive,

57
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,799
I'd suggest you
never cross me.

58
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:07,607
Hey! What are you
guys doing?! Let go!

59
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,412
Hahahaha!

60
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,348
You call this little
kid's toy a weapon?

61
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,583
Hahahaha!

62
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,452
[FRANKY]
See ya later, Long-Nose.

63
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,722
Thanks again for the
200 million Berries.

64
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:24,124
[USOPP]
No! Wait! Give it back!

65
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,559
Give back the Merry!

66
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,796
You hear me?! Give it back!

67
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:35,102
No! Give it back!

68
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:40,340
[laughter]

69
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,518
No! Give it back!

70
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,724
Give it back!

71
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:09,436
[jeers and laughter]

72
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,338
No! Please!

73
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,611
Give it back!!

74
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,757
[NAMI] I need to wait here
until Robin comes back.

75
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,596
If I march in with
the others right now,

76
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,731
I'll just be in the way.

77
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,466
It'll be scary, too.

78
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,504
For now the best thing
I can do is stay here,

79
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,639
guard the money and
protect the Merry.

80
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,775
Don't let me down, guys.

81
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,611
I'm counting on you!

82
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,646
[SANJI]
Stop Stop!!

83
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,152
[SANJI]
If I remember correctly.

84
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,487
This is the place
Nami was talking about.

85
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,226
[NAMI] Look. This is the
backstreet shopping district.

86
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,530
You go up this canal,
turn, then here!

87
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,365
Usopp is right here!

88
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,566
[CHOPPER]
Got it.

89
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,102
[SANJI] Nami, where are those
dismantlers you mentioned?

90
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:18,072
The Franky Family. Show me.

91
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,607
[CHOPPER]
Hey, Usopp!

92
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,507
[SANJI]
I guess he left.

93
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,441
[ZORO]
Are you sure?

94
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,077
Maybe you just screwed
up the directions.

95
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,279
[SANJI] I'm not you, moron!
Shut your hole!

96
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,281
[CHOPPER]
Usopp!

97
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,148
What'd you say?

98
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,349
Look at this!

99
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,157
It's blood! See?

100
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,158
That idiot,

101
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,694
I guess he walked off
somewhere on his own.

102
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:43,297
Wait, you don't think that he--

103
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,731
Usopp, no.

104
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,601
[LUFFY]
Aaaaaaaaaaaa...

105
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,769
Huh?

106
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:53,673
...aaaaaaaaa!

107
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,317
Luffy!

108
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,720
Help! I'm drowning!

109
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,456
[coughing]

110
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,491
[SANJI]
What are you doing?

111
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:14,127
And where the hell
did you fall from?

112
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,165
[LUFFY] The shipyard. I was
trying to jump around

113
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,302
like that carpenter
to look for Usopp.

114
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,269
[CHOPPER]
Are you all right?

115
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,437
[LUFFY]
Yeah.

116
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,105
Oh, that's right!
I almost forgot!

117
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,440
We've got a terrible problem!

118
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,642
Usopp was abducted
and so was the money!

119
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,178
We know. That's why
we're here. Come on.

120
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,746
We were just about to
head over to the hideout

121
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,448
of the guys that did it.

122
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,484
I'll bet that's where we'll
find Usopp and the money.

123
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,755
[SANJI] Maybe he felt
responsible about what

124
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,490
happened and went
to settle the matter

125
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,192
with the Franky
Family on his own.

126
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,569
[CORGY] All right then.
We'll be leaving now.

127
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,746
That man is
seriously stubborn!

128
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,514
It's infuriating!

129
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,817
We don't even know
if he has it or not,

130
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,719
yet they keep
sending me out here.

131
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:12,987
Over and over again.

132
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,389
I wish those people would put
themselves in my shoes for once.

133
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,329
[knocking]

134
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,499
It's Kalifa.

135
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,334
[ICEBERG]
Mwell, come in.

136
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,738
You must be worn out, Sir.

137
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,606
Would you like
something to drink?

138
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:35,275
[ICEBERG]
I would. Thank you.

139
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,445
[ICEBERG]
Maybe some tea.

140
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,181
[KALIFA]
I've already prepared it.

141
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:44,218
Mwell, I'd expect
nothing less from you.

142
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,152
Thank you. I'm grateful.

143
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,226
Poor Mr. Corgy is always so
angry when he leaves, isn't he?

144
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,495
What in the world does he
come here to talk about?

145
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:56,096
[ICEBERG]
Oh, that.

146
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,399
Those he represents
want something I have,

147
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,433
and they keep
making various offers.

148
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,306
It must be something of
great importance then, isn't it?

149
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,408
Mwell, maybe so,

150
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,544
though I always deny
knowing anything about it.

151
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:13,513
They really are tiresome people.

152
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,038
[LUFFY]
Is he breathing, Chopper?

153
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:42,710
[CHOPPER] He's unconscious
but yes, he's breathing.

154
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:45,212
He'll live. I can save him.

155
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,653
You wait out here for us.

156
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,187
'Kay, Usopp?

157
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:18,546
[LUFFY]
We're gonna go level

158
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:21,448
that stupid house
to the ground.

159
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:48,375
[cheering]

160
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,481
[FAMILY A] Hey! Somebody
go buy some more food!

161
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,383
[FAMILY B] Yeah!
We've got the money!

162
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,019
[FAMILY C] Get some more
booze while you're at it!

163
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,492
When it comes to painting,
I'm in a league of my own!

164
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,093
So, what do you think?

165
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,233
M-My goggles!

166
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,669
You got them back
from that creep for me!

167
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,437
Thank you so much!

168
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,445
Well! Let me tell you about
the time that I, Usopp,

169
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:27,181
bravely fought off vicious
sea kings in the Calm Belt,

170
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:30,650
young Chopper.
Big ones, too! Huge!

171
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:40,193
Be warned! Captain Usopp
has an army! 8000 men!

172
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:51,137
[USOPP]
They took all of the money.

173
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:58,345
How can I face the
others now, Nami?

174
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,715
All right, guys, it's
time to kick their asses.

175
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,316
All of them!

176
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,058
[KIDROCK]
That's it! Show 'em!

177
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,359
Looks like you
lose this round!

178
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,295
Losers get to go
pick up more booze!

179
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:16,130
Buy all the food they
have in the shop, too!

180
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,265
It's not like we
don't have the money!

181
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,134
[laughter]

182
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:25,706
Be right back.

183
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,675
And when I am,
I'm gonna win every hand.

184
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,409
Just you wait!

185
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,383
Hmm?

186
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:40,554
Ahh!

187
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,398
[RAZ-BERET] What was that?
What happened?!

188
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,238
Who the hell are those guys?

189
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:59,639
You jerks! You got a death wish?

190
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,417
I recognize them!

191
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,463
It's that pirate.

192
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:24,631
Straw Hat Luffy!

193
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,442
Ha ha ha!

194
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:39,413
So you came here to get
your money back, did ya?

195
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:40,481
Bad move.

196
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:42,349
Just take a
look around you.

197
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,684
Do you really think the four

198
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,453
of you are enough
to handle all of us?

199
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,256
Ha ha ha!

200
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,824
But, since you're here,

201
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:51,891
we might as well

202
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:54,661
take those big bounties
you've got on your heads.

203
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,631
He's the captain of
that long-nosed weakling

204
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,366
we took care of earlier.

205
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,433
[laughter]

206
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,136
With that pitiful excuse
for a pirate on his crew,

207
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:04,704
he can't possibly
be that strong.

208
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,477
Let's go! C'mon, shrimp!

209
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,347
Now, Gum Gum...

210
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,117
Huh?

211
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,055
What do you
think you're doing?

212
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:21,789
Hahaha!

213
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:22,790
Are you punching him?

214
00:15:22,823 --> 00:15:25,492
Not even a bombardment
from battleship cannons

215
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,127
can put a dent in that armor.

216
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,262
Hahaha! What a joke!

217
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,569
If you're just
gonna play around,

218
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,672
then I'll go ahead
and end this right now.

219
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,290
And Cannon!

220
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:07,601
[cries of surprise]

221
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,606
[POLKA-HAT] He punched
a hole right through it!

222
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,542
[ZAMBAI]
Hey!

223
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,611
Hold on! W-Wait a
second, you guys!

224
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,180
Let's talk about this first!

225
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:24,118
[ZAMBAI]
Okay? Guys?

226
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,353
Okay, guys,
fire the cannons!

227
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:34,160
Now, Three-Sword
Style Kara Suma...

228
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,468
...Raven Hunt!

229
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:55,716
What?! Impossible!

230
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,151
Those cannonballs
are made of iron!

231
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:06,794
The cannons, too?!

232
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:08,262
[GOLDILOCKS]
Holy crap!

233
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:10,363
These guys are
seriously bad news!

234
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,433
[PURPLE SHIRT]
Let's get out of here!

235
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,434
Everybody run
for the back door!

236
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,445
You guys started this fight.

237
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:27,581
It's kind of pathetic to
run from it like cowards.

238
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,783
Party Table...

239
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,085
...Kick Course!

240
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,700
We... We can't make
it to the backdoor!

241
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,269
Windows! Use the windows!

242
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:51,404
[CHOPPER]
Rumble!

243
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,040
Horn Point!

244
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,419
Roseo Colonnade!

245
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:15,696
Wait! Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, you guys!

246
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:16,630
It's the money, right?

247
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:17,864
You just want the money back?

248
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:22,202
The 200 million berries the
long-nosed guy had? Is that it?

249
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,470
I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you,

250
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,673
but that pile of money
isn't here anymore.

251
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,308
Franky, the family
boss, took all of it

252
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,076
and went out on
a shopping spree!

253
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,611
And since he's buying
something on the black market,

254
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:32,446
we don't have any idea
where he might be

255
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,648
or even how to find him!

256
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,717
So, no matter how much
of a rampage you go on,

257
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,086
that 200 million
won't be coming back!

258
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,487
So why don't you an--

259
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:44,758
Zambai!

260
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,628
Shut up. That's
enough out of you.

261
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:50,564
This has nothing to
do with the money.

262
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:53,800
Damn straight.
It's too late for that.

263
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:01,107
Not even your bones will
be left when we're done.

264
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:03,244
Not even our bones?!

265
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,045
What's the matter with you?

266
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,512
Acting like a
bunch of cowards!

267
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:06,846
<i>We're</i> the Franky Family!

268
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,250
<i>We're</i> the ones who do all the
bone breaking around here!

269
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:11,452
Got it? Never
forget who you are!

270
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:12,519
Okay, brothers!

271
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:15,622
Let's show 'em the specialty
of The Franky House!

272
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:24,397
Now! Fire the
Anything Shot Cannon!

273
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:34,642
[BEARDFACE]
Here they come! Attack!

274
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:35,709
[SORBO]
Don't let up!

275
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:38,412
Keep firing until there's
nothing left to shoot!

276
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:41,248
[GIANT SPIKE] Come on!
There're only four of them!

277
00:19:58,131 --> 00:19:58,766
[CITIZENS]
Huh?

278
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,667
[FRANKY]
Huh?

279
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,669
[CITIZEN C]
What was that? Fireworks?

280
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,470
[CITIZEN D]
Sounds like it's coming

281
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,638
from out toward
The Franky House.

282
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,074
Them again?

283
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:08,709
What trouble are
they up to this time?

284
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,277
I know, right?

285
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,546
Hey! Quiet, they're
gonna hear us!

286
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:16,517
[MOZU]
Oh, boy.

287
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,285
Sounds like they're
getting a little carried away.

288
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,254
[KIWI]
When those boys party.

289
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:23,424
They really don't show
any restraint, now do they?

290
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:26,460
[FRANKY] No big deal. It's not
like they do it all the time.

291
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:31,331
It's a nice day. Hahaha!

292
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:47,147
[SANJI]
Should we go after Franky?

293
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,015
And start looking where?

294
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,685
Ah, man, looks like these idiots

295
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:55,522
really didn't know
where he took the money.

296
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,589
[SANJI]
And if we do find him.

297
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:59,759
If he spent it, then
there's no getting it back.

298
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,298
What now? Even if we
wait around for him,

299
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:06,600
he might not be
back for quite a while.

300
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:11,205
Okay! The first aid
treatment is all done!

301
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:12,706
We need to take him
back on a stretcher,

302
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:15,709
so I could use
some help over here!

303
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,578
Hanging around here
won't do any good.

304
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,446
Let's head back to
the ship for now.

305
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,049
We left Nami there
all by herself

306
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:24,752
and Robin's still missing.

307
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,820
The ship's a problem, too.

308
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:27,821
[ZORO]
Yeah.

309
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:29,623
Hey, Luffy!

310
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,696
[LUFFY]
I've made a decision.

311
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,030
Huh?

312
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,466
About the ship.

313
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,478
It's time to part
ways with the Merry.

314
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,613
We'll say goodbye
to her here.

315
00:21:57,584 --> 00:22:02,589
♪ ending song ♪

316
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:15,629
[USOPP] Hey, you're
taking this joke too far!

317
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:18,399
[LUFFY] It's not a joke.
We're leaving the Merry behind.

318
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:20,267
[USOPP] Don't be
ridiculous! You're lying!

319
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,101

Usopp, please.

320
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:22,803
[LUFFY]
She can't be fixed anymore!

321
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:25,039
She's gonna sink!
Understand?

00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:27,808

you say, I won't abandon her!
