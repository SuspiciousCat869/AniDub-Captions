00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,304
[USOPP]
Just a minute, old‐timer!

174
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,505
You can't write me off
as a novice

175
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,641
until you've checked out
my work first!

176
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,310
Like this shell here.

177
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,411
[yells]

178
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,479
[USOPP]
That thing is huge!

179
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,480
G‐Gigantic!

180
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,148
G‐Ginormous!

181
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,818
I didn't give you permission
to cross my threshold!

182
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,719
[USOPP] Old‐timer,
that thing can't be real!

183
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,488
It's paper‐maché, right?

184
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,923
What would paper‐maché be doing

185
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:40,259
lying around a firework
master's home?

186
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,327
Yes, it's real.

187
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,663
So, what were you
babbling about?

188
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,864
A shell?

189
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,432
Oh.

190
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,434
Uh...

191
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,336
Eh...

192
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,571
Shell? What shell?

193
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,673
You must've heard me wrong.

194
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:54,841
[gasps]

195
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,542
[KODAMA]
A three‐gauge shell, huh?

196
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,611
Feels like it's pasted
together a little loosely,

197
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,247
but I think it would
still function.

198
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,515
Why were you hiding it?

199
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,217
It's really not
a bad piece of work.

200
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,284
You should finish it.

201
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,420
Huh? Who are you, squirt?

202
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,387
[KODAMA]
I'm Kodama,

203
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,857
the granddaughter of
Boss Odama over there.

204
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,359
Ohh. So... you're
the little girl

205
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,895
who makes the fireworks
with the old man, huh?

206
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,897
Yep. That's me, all right.

207
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,766
But don't let my age fool ya.
I'm pretty skillful.

208
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,470
In my not‐so‐humble opinion,
maybe even as much as Grandpa.

209

00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,573
[KODAMA groans]

211
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,475
If you're done,
there's work to do!

212
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,811
I thought I told you to
contact the launch team!

213
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:32,912
[KODAMA]
I did!

214
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,548
They're going to be here
shortly to carry the shells.

215
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,884
I was just on my way
to get them out.

216
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:38,718
[ODAMA]
But before you do that,

217
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,386
you've got to
prepare the mortars

218
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,721
and get the wagon ready first!

219
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:42,588
[KODAMA]
I know, I know!

220
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,224
I'll get right on it,
you mean grump!

221
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,264
You still here?

222
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,798
Well, don't just
stand there, novice!

223
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:53,900
Go help her!

224
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:54,800
[USOPP]
Why?

225
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,302
‐‐Because I told you to!

226
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,737
‐‐[USOPP yelps]
‐‐Because I told you to!

227
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,273
[clattering]

228
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,508
What's with this guy?

229
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,278
First he tells me to leave
and then he tells me to help!

230
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,979
No gunpowder's worth this crap!

231
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:07,847
[KODAMA]
Hey!

232
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:08,814
[USOPP]
Hm?

233
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:09,916
Slacking off?

234
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,785
Come on, gimme a hand.

235
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,487
What?!

236
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,923
You're not here to
become an apprentice?

237
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,324
Nope, not me.

238
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,992
The only reason I came
here was to hopefully

239
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,694
bum some gunpowder off you guys.

240
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,762
You made your own firework.

241
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,498
I thought for sure you
wanted to be an apprentice.

242
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,833
[USOPP] Well, I just
made that one for fun.

243
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,836
I hate to admit it, but I'm
not really up to working pro.

244
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,837
Okay.

245
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,540
But honestly, that shell
was well put‐together.

246
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,809
I think you should just
hurry up and finish the thing.

247
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:37,877
[USOPP grunts]

248
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,780
Hey, that's the second time
you said that to me.

249
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:41,981
What do you mean?

250
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:45,484
You saw the shell.
It is finished already.

251
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,619
No, it's not.

252
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,487
A firework is
never truly finished

253
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,057
until it blossoms beautifully
in the night sky.

254
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,993
Because of that, we consider all
the fireworks in the storehouse

255
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,027
as unfinished.

256
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,896
[USOPP]
Ooh...

257
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,998
Same thing with these
launching mortars.

258
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,533
They're not considered
finished either

259
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,468
until they've
fired their shells.

260
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,304
Wow, squirt, you're
pretty deep for a kid.

261
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,672
It's just like I said.

262
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,075
I'm young, but don't
let my age fool ya.

263
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,043
I won't. So what about...

264
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,080
...that big one in there?
Can you say the same?

265
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,715
That it's not considered
finished either

266
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:16,983
until you set it off?

267
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,086
Man, I'd love to be around to
see that thing go ka‐blooey!

268
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,021
[USOPP chuckles]

269
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,757
[KODAMA] Last year we tried to
launch a big one just like that.

270
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,526
Whoa. You mean another
gigantic one like that?

271
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,829
[KODAMA]
Mm‐hm.

272
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,430
But it didn't work.

273
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,932
The equipment was flawed.

274
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,500
There was an accident.

275
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,670
Uhh... Wait,
you don't mean that‐‐

276
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,842
[KODAMA]
Both my mommy and my daddy‐‐

277
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,011
They died.

278
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,014
It was a year ago today...

279
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,882
...when the launch of the
two‐hundred‐gauge shell

280
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,519
went wrong.

281
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,641
[USOPP] The weather's
really crummy today, huh?

282
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,943
Do you still hold
this party if it rains?

283
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,312
[KODAMA]
Uh‐uh.

284
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,616
If the weather allows it,
I promise you I'll do it.

285
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,953
‐‐[footsteps]
‐‐[USOPP] Hm?

286
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,560
[ODAMA]
Continue with the preparations.

287
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,462
[KODAMA]
Okay!

288
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,898
You promise to do what?

289
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,400
[USOPP]
Uh?

290
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,636
You see,

291
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,838
if the weather clears up, I'm
planning on launching that big

292
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,740
two‐hundred‐gauge shell tonight.

293
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,075
[gasps, grunts]

294
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,042
[ODAMA]
Hm?

295
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,011
[KODAMA] No, silly!
Fireworks aren't food!

296
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,879
I know some of them are
called firecrackers,

297
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,581
but you can't actually eat them!

298
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,983
[door opens, closes]

299
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,555
[KODAMA]
It's a secret, you dummy!

300
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,590
[USOPP]
Oh, sorry.

301
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,726
But look, I don't care
how old you are.

302
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,395
You can't launch something
that big by yourself.

303
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,663
Yeah, I know.

304
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,665
That's why I secretly asked
the launch team to help me out

305
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:13,899
and they said they would.

306
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,836
Yeah, but one of those things
failed to launch before, right?

307
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:17,837
It's dangerous.

308
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,739
[KODAMA] Don't worry.
We'll take precautions.

309
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,606
It's okay.

310
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,874
No, it is not!

311
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,010
Both you and your launch team
could get blown to smithereens!

312
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,679
[KODAMA]
We'll be careful.

313
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,513
And just for the record,

314
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:30,082
the launch team
only has to set it up.

315
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,452
They'll take cover and I'll
launch the firework by myself.

316
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,020
By yourself, huh?

317
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,722
[USOPP groans]

318
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,957
No, you won't!

319
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,893
I'm telling your
grandpa right now!

320
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,863
[USOPP yells]

321
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,534
[USOPP groans] Just what
do you think you're doing?!

322
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,069
That's what I was gonna say!

323
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,038
I won't let you ruin my
mommy and daddy's dream!

324
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,574
Ruin your mommy
and daddy's dream?

325
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,043
That's right.

326
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,713
My family's been making
fireworks for generations‐‐

327
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,782
for over 400 years now.

328
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,650
‐‐Ow, leave it alone!
‐‐Hey! Hold still!

329
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,052
Sometime in the past my family
had the technical skill

330
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,722
to make and launch
two‐hundred‐gauge shells.

331
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:14,393
But at some point, those skills
were lost and they stopped.

332
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,962
It was my mommy and daddy's
dream to bring back those skills

333
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,899
and restart the
old tradition again.

334
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,734
And that's why I'm
going to make sure

335
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,804
their dream finally
comes true tonight!

336
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,573
Hey, I understand
how you feel, but‐‐

337
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,440
[USOPP gasps]

338
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,675
Hey, hold on!

339
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:33,445
Why are you blabbing to me about
all your secret plan stuff?

340
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,148
Wanna know?

341
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,750
[gasps]

342
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,987
[USOPP]
Keep your grandpa occupied?

343
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,122
[KODAMA]
Yes.

344
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,857
The guys from the launch team
will be arriving soon

345
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,592

521
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:12,257
<i>With friends and family...</i>
<i>Who'd pick me up...♪</i>

522
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,264
[ZORO sneezes]

523
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,199
[ROBIN] You're going to catch
a cold dressed like that.

524
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,367
[ZORO]
People who catch colds

525
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,269
are people who let their
mind's guard down.

526
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,238
[ROBIN] I wonder if someone
somewhere is spreading stories

527
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,973
about Zoro the Pirate Hunter.

528
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:28,940
[ZORO]
Why would they say that?

529
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,943
I've never once called
myself a pirate hunter.

530
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,445
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

531
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:37,616
"The Fabled Pirate Hunter!
Zoro, the Wandering Swordsman!"

532
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,552
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
