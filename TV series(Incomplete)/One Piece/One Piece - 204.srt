1
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:50,749
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:52,208
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,878
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,546
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:00,050
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:04,429
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,226
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:18,026
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:22,530
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:25,742
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:27,827
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:32,916
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:38,213
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:42,133
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:45,053
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,013
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:52,394
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:54,270
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:59,234
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:01,277
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:07,033
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:14,124
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:21,923
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,555
[LUFFY] "The Gold and Waver
Recovery Operations!"

25
00:02:33,184 --> 00:02:35,228
[NAMI]
All right, guys! Enough waiting!

26
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:37,147
Let's go get our gold back!

27
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,231
[STRAW HATS]
Yeah!

28
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:40,483
[USOPP]
Hey! Wait a minute!

29
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:42,318
Huh? What's wrong, Usopp?

30
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:44,195
[USOPP] We can't just
rush off like this!

31
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:46,990
Shouldn't we come up
with some sorta plan first?

32
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:48,491
[ALL]
Hm?

33
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:51,119
[sighs] Oh, great...

34
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:53,288
We're off to a successful start.

35
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:54,622
Don'tcha think those
Marines will notice

36
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:57,000
seven people sneaking
around their fortress?

37
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,335
[ZORO]
You got a point there.

38
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:00,295
[USOPP] I'm still worried
about the Merry, too,

39
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:02,464
even though we did
disguise her pretty well.

40
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:05,133
[SANJI] It won't fool
'em for long, though.

41
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:06,801
Wait, you don't think so?

42
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:07,802
Why not?

43
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,888
Yeah, don't worry!
It looks real!

44
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:11,097
That hunk of junk? Please. Co--

45
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:12,390
Don't you dare call it junk!

46
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:14,559
And besides, that's
not the issue here!

47
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:15,977
[sigh]

48
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,438
Honestly, am I the only
member of this crew that thinks

49
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:19,939
about the important things?

50
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:22,108
Like, for instance,
coming up with a plan

51
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:24,402
to recover what's
rightfully ours?

52
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:26,780
That reminds me! You!

53
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:28,406
Uh, me?

54
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,575
[USOPP]
What happened to the waver?

55
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:34,329
Oh, crap! I-I hid it in some
tall grass! I forgot!

56
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:35,914
[USOPP]
Do ya see what I mean?

57
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:36,998
[laughs] Sorry!

58
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:40,418
Nami, you're so cute
when you forget!

59
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:43,046
Well, all stupidity aside...

60
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:44,714
I think it's about
time I explained

61
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:49,636
my plan to all you guys.
Okay, listen up!

62
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,720
Ta-da!

63
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:53,056
All right! Here's
the scoop, people!

64
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,600
We're gonna have to
split up into two teams!

65
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:57,644
First is the Gold Recovery Team!

66
00:03:57,727 --> 00:04:02,524
It consists of Luffy...
Zoro... Robin...

67
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,234
...and Captain Usopp!

68
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:06,778
Team two will be the
Waver Recovery Team!

69
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:10,740
It consists of Nami,
and her partner will be...

70
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:11,991
--[CHOPPER] Ah.
-- [USOPP] ...Sanji!

71
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:13,702
[whines]

72
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:16,204
[yells]

73
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:18,623
What an incredible plan, Usopp!

74
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:21,668
[laughs] Can't wait to
work with you, partner!

75
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:23,169
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:24,963
What a dumbass.

77
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:26,214
You jerk.

78
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:27,841
So, Usopp?

79
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:30,427
You're just gonna leave me
alone with the ship again?

80
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,678
Hey, don't worry!

81
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:33,054
The Merry's disguised so well,

82
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:34,931
I'm pretty sure you
won't be discovered.

83
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,433
[CHOPPER]
Pretty sure?

84
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:38,184
And what will
happen if we get hurt?

85
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:40,562
We need you here
to tend to our injuries...

86
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:42,772
He-he. Super Doctor!

87
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:44,232
Hey!

88
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:47,193
You're just tryin'
to suck up to me!

89
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:49,195
It won't work, jerk!

90
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,405
[USOPP]
All right, guys.

91
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:52,407
This dial represents
where we are right now.

92
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,367
The Gold Recovery Ream
will need to avoid

93
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:56,411
the heavily-guarded routes
and take the shortest path

94
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:59,080
along the coast to
the storage vault.

95
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:01,207
Now, Nami, do you
happen to remember

96
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,001
the spot where
you hid the waver?

97
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:05,795
Yes, on the eastern
side of the island.

98
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,382
Along this bay here, just
at the base of these cliffs.

99
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:11,468
[USOPP]
Hm...

100
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,678
Almost opposite of us.

101
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:16,306
Hm. It'll take you guys
too long to get there

102
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:17,807
if you go by land.

103
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:21,436
Huh... Uh! Ah...
Yes! That'll do it!

104
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,520
[OTHERS]
Hm?

105
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:23,646
[USOPP]
Nami, that boat should get you

106
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,648
and Sanji across
the bay in a jiffy!

107
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:26,691
[NAMI]
Huh?

108
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:27,776
[USOPP]
All right, teams!

109
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:29,110
Let's complete our missions

110
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:31,946
and then we'll meet back
here at the Merry, got it?

111
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,698
[ALL]
Yeah!

112
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:36,159
[JONATHAN groans]

113
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:41,581
Oh. you're still here, huh?

114
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:43,166
I said dismissed.

115
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:46,461
Sorry, sir, but the Head Chef
gave me very specific orders!

116
00:05:46,544 --> 00:05:49,214
"Don't leave until the
commander's cleaned his plate!"

117
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:51,091
Even if you're dining
in your private quarters,

118
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:52,842
rules are rules.
You know the credo!

119
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:55,720
Plus, she was very adamant
that you finish every last bite!

120
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:57,847
[JONATHAN groans]

121
00:05:57,931 --> 00:05:59,015
Jessica!

122
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:00,600
[SERGEANT chuckles]

123
00:06:00,684 --> 00:06:01,768
You, too, Sergeant!

124
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:02,936
What?!

125
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,563
The Head Chef made
dinner for you as well!

126
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:07,649
Bon appétit, sirs!

127
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:10,402
Not a fan of the
broccoli either, eh?

128
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:13,405
No, for me, it's
the tomatoes and carrots.

129
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:15,323
[SHINPACHI]
Hm?

130
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,492
Oh! Lieutenant!

131
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:19,035
[DRAKE]
Oh, you're eating!

132
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,037
Sorry! I-I'll come back later.

133
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:22,872
[JONATHAN]
No, no, not at all!

134
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,624
You couldn't have
come at a better time!

135
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,209
[DRAKE]
Sir?

136
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:28,962
[JONATHAN] In fact, I was just
about to send for you, Drake!

137
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:31,673
Y-Yes sir, about that!

138
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:34,759
I accept full responsibility
for losing the Straw Hats!

139
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:36,052
[JONATHAN]
It doesn't matter!

140
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:39,139
Say, have you had dinner
yet, Lieutenant Drake?

141
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:39,973
No...

142
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:42,183
Not good! Not good at all!

143
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,602
Ya can't fight the
enemy on an empty stomach!

144
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:47,897
Ya have to set an example for
the men that serve under you!

145
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:50,066
They won't eat
if you won't, am I right?

146
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,026
[DRAKE]
Uh-huh.

147
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,819
[JONATHAN]
Bon appétit, Drake.

148
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:55,697
Be sure to eat every last bite!

149
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,241
[groans]

150
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:02,495
Tell her it was even
more delicious than usual!

151
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:03,830
[SHINPACHI]
Understood, sir.

152
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:12,547
[SHEPHERD]
Hmph!

153
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:15,592
Food for the old badger, ah?

154
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:18,053
Well, I hope you
enjoyed it, Commander,

155
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:20,764
since it'll be one of
your last meals here.

156
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:23,141
[chuckling]

157
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:28,521
[JONATHAN]
It's almost time.

158
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:31,149
Let's mobilize the units
and get them into position.

159
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:32,901
So, the plan is to
hurry ahead of them

160
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:34,861
and block their path, sir?

161
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:37,030
[JONATHAN] Correct. Sergeant,
pass along the orders

162
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:38,698
to the units that
are standing by.

163
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:39,783
[SERGEANT]
Sir!

164
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,621
[SERGEANT]
Attention all warships!

165
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:46,331
Urgent orders
from the commander!

166
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:50,293
Proceed to your designated areas
around the Sea Gate and the Bay!

167
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:52,295
[DRAKE]
What about my unit, sir?

168
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,923
Let them finish their dinner
first. As soon as they're done,

169
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:56,883
take them and your
ship to the Sea Gate.

170
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:57,759
[DRAKE]
Yes, sir!

171
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:59,219
[door opens]

172
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:02,806
Hold it!

173
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:05,934
Well, hello there, Condoriano.

174
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:08,853
Oh, I'm sorry.
Pardon my mistake.

175
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:12,607
I meant to say Special
Inspector Major Shepherd!

176
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:14,943
[SHEPHERD]
Commander Jonathan.

177
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:16,653
Scuttlebutt around this base

178
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:19,781
is that the Straw Hats
slipped through your fingers.

179
00:08:19,864 --> 00:08:21,157
No, no.

180
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:22,617
They haven't escaped yet.

181
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:24,828
In fact, I'm sure they're
still on the base somewhere.

182
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:27,205
[SHEPHERD] Oh? Yet you're
able to sit here and enjoy

183
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:29,290
a leisurely meal knowing that?

184
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:32,043
I guess the whispers about
you and Navarone are true!

185
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:34,295
They say that you wouldn't
know what to do in an attack

186
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,048
since you haven't
seen action in so long.

187
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:38,258
No offense.

188
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:40,510
No, none taken, Major.

189
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:41,845
So, Commander,

190
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:44,931
what makes you think those
pirates are still here?

191
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:46,391
Well, for one thing,

192
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:49,019
I have their gold, and
no self-respecting pirate

193
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:51,354
would ever leave
their treasure behind.

194
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:53,356
[SHEPHERD]
Gold, ah?

195
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,359
The recent downsizing here
has cut our forces in half.

196
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:58,069
Navarone needs all
the help it can get

197
00:08:58,153 --> 00:08:59,529
to capture these pirates.

198
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:01,322
Is there any way that
I could persuade you

199
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:04,367
to give us a hand in
that area, Major Shepherd?

200
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:05,994
I'm even willing
to put you in charge

201
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:09,164
of an especially-skilled
unit if you'll agree.

202
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:11,041
Don't be absurd!

203
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:13,001
You're the only person
worthy of commanding

204
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:17,047
the skilled units of Navarone!
Don't you agree?

205
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,967
[snickers] Speaking of your men,
I need the names of all those

206
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:23,845
who mistook me for a Straw Hat.

207
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:27,307
May I ask why you need
to know their names?

208
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,977
[SHEPHERD] So they can all
be court-martialed, of course.

209
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:33,646
You shouldn't blame them.
I'm the one who gave the order

210
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,816
to arrest all suspicious-looking
people on sight.

211
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,402
Those men, they were
just following my orders.

212
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:41,529
I looked like
a suspicious person?

213
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:43,448
[JONATHAN]
Under the circumstances, yes.

214
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:45,700
Well, I couldn't disagree more.

215
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:47,952
I just remembered
something I need to do.

216
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:49,788
We'll take this matter up later.

217
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:52,082
[door closes]

218
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:54,709
Pardon me, but is
that prudent, sir?

219
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:57,796
[laughs] He's one of those
pompous windbags from HQ

220
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,256
who think that Navarone's
outlived its usefulness.

221
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,716
I knew he'd never seriously

222
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,510
consider leading
one of our units.

223
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:06,012
That's not what
I meant, Commander!

224
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:07,263
Oh, well...

225
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:08,765
Lieutenant Drake,

226
00:10:08,848 --> 00:10:11,393
prepare to dispatch the most
powerful squad in all of G8!

227
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:13,228
Another one of your jokes, sir?

228
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:14,729
[JONATHAN]
No, I'm serious.

229
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:17,107
[chuckles]

230
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,191
[gasps]

231
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:26,449
[SHEPHERD]
What an idiot!

232
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:27,992
You!

233
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:30,370
The Stan Marey docked at this
backwater base this morning!

234
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:32,038
Where's its captain?

235
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:34,749
[MARINE D] Sir! He's been in the
infirmary since we've docked!

236
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,042
The infirmary?

237
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:37,877
Why, is he injured?

238
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:40,088
No, sir, but many of
his crewmen were hurt.

239
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:41,464
He seemed pretty concerned.

240
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:43,341
I'm sure that's where
you'll be able to find him.

241
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,051
Go get him! Right now!

242
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:46,469
Sir!

243
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:50,557
So, the pirates are after
their gold, are they?

244
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,975
Well, there's only
one place in this

245
00:10:52,058 --> 00:10:54,561
fortress where it
could be hidden!

246
00:10:54,644 --> 00:10:56,438
[SHEPHERD] Just watch,
you worthless old badger!

247
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:59,441
I'm going to catch those
Straw Hats, end your career,

248
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:01,651
and shut this useless base down!

249
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:03,987
[laughs]

250
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:08,658
I hope they get back soon.

251
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:14,122
'Cause I'm so lonely!

252
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:15,290
[SANJI]
The moon!

253
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:16,791
The stars!

254
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,711
And bathed in their glow are
Nami and me in a cozy boat!

255
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:24,215
This is so unbelievable!
It's like a dream come true!

256
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,594
[NAMI]
Those warships are moving out!

257
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:31,514
I've got a bad
feeling about all this!

258
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:33,600
Sanji, we've gotta
hurry! Row faster!

259
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:36,353
[SANJI] Oh! Anything
for you, Captain Nami!

260
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:38,104
[NAMI]
Just do it quietly, okay?

261
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:39,481
[SANJI]
Okay!

262
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:43,568
[USOPP] Clear to the left,
and clear to the right.

263
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:45,570
Move out! If we
can keep this up,

264
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:48,073
we'll be able to sneak
into the fortress unnoticed!

265
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:50,367
[ZORO] At the rate we're
going, that'll be next year!

266
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:55,705
The coast is clear.

267
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:57,165
There are no
soldiers in the area.

268
00:11:57,248 --> 00:11:59,709
Then why didn't
you say so sooner?!

269
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:01,753
[USOPP]
Hm? Ugh.

270
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:03,338
How can you sleep
at a time like this?

271
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:06,132
Ah! Get it together,
would ya, Luffy?!

272
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:07,050
[grunts]

273
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:09,094
Does he ever stress out?

274
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,348
Um, Commander...

275
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:15,767
Not to second guess you, but
won't relocating those units

276
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,019
leave the base itself
relatively undefended?

277
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:19,562
It can't be helped.

278
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:21,731
Besides, those pirates have
proven that they'll go

279
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:23,858
wherever they want,
when they want.

280
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,444
Sir, we can't just let
those Straw Hat Pirates

281
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,321
run around as if
they own the place.

282
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:29,906
If I could make a
recommendation,

283
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:31,866
why don't we mobilize
the new recruits?

284
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,536
No, Sergeant. That would
be too dangerous for them.

285
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:35,954
I thought you'd say
that, Commander.

286
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:38,415
For the record,
this wasn't my idea.

287
00:12:38,498 --> 00:12:41,459
It was the recruits'
idea, sir. They volunteered.

288
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:43,628
Even though they're new here,
they've quickly developed

289
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:47,257
the same duty and dedication
to G8 that the rest of us have!

290
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,217
[JONATHAN]
Is that so?

291
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,511
Well, then, let's put
them on surveillance duty.

292
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:53,346
However, they are not
to engage the enemy

293
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,056
under any circumstances.

294
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,808
Is that understood?

295
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:59,394
Yes! They'll be delighted, sir!

296
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:01,563
Pass the orders on,
but before you leave,

297
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:04,107
I have one other
request for you, Sergeant.

298
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,734
Sir?

299
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:07,110
[laughs]

300
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,127
[CAPTAIN]
What? That's insane!

301
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,254
You know that storm
crippled the Stan Marey!

302
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,298
She'll be stuck in the
repair dock for weeks!

303
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:30,759
Your flagship might be down,
but the rest of the ships

304
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:32,886
in your fleet aren't
out of commission.

305
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:35,764
[CAPTAIN] That's true,
but we don't have the manpower!

306
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,557
We suffered a lot of injuries!

307
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,975
A lot of the men
are in bad shape!

308
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,561
Some of them still
can't even walk yet!

309
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:43,772
Now then, you
wouldn't be questioning

310
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,648
my judgment, Captain?

311
00:13:45,732 --> 00:13:47,192
An inspector, assigned here

312
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:49,861
by no less authority
than Marine Headquarters?

313
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:52,197
No, not at all!
It's just that...

314
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,531
...well, I--

315
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,116
Then gather your men, Captain!

316
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,659
Half will stay with me.

317
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:59,454
The rest will board the Pinepeak
and wait for my orders!

318
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:03,041
Get moving on the double!
I've got a lot of work to do!

319
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:06,378
And just watch! I'm going to
show these useless G8 fools

320
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:09,089
how a real Marine
deals with pirate scum!

321
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,591
[USOPP]
Hey, Zoro!

322
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:14,219
What's wrong? Can't keep up?

323
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:16,721
Shut your trap, or I'll
shut it for you, Usopp!

324
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:19,516
[laughs] Hey,
Robin? We there yet?

325
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:21,351
Just a little further!

326
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:23,144
[USOPP grunts]

327
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:29,025
Is this really the place?

328
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:30,193
[ZORO]
Behind that door?

329
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:31,611
[ROBIN]
If the map's correct, yes.

330
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:33,238
[USOPP] And the vault's
pretty close, huh?

331
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,490
[ROBIN] Yes, so breaking
in through that spot

332
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:36,991
should be the shortest route.

333
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:39,661
[LUFFY] Then it's decided!
That's where we're going!

334
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,833
All right! Let's do it, guys!

335
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:50,296
Usopp-- [yelling]

336
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:54,718
Oh, yeah!

337
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:56,886
[LUFFY grunts]

338
00:14:57,887 --> 00:14:59,347
[laughs]

339
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,473
--[USOPP] Huh?
--[LUFFY] Let's go!

340
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:04,060
--[USOPP screaming]
--[LUFFY laughing]

341
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:10,650
[USOPP screaming]

342
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,277
Luffy!

343
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:16,698
[screaming]

344
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:24,497
What's wrong? Ya can't keep up?

345
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:26,082
[USOPP groans]

00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,417
[LUFFY]
Let's do that again!

347
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,210
[USOPP]
Forget it! You're nuts!

348
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:36,593
[USOPP] We're in luck!
Not a Marine in sight!

349
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:40,722
[LUFFY]
Comin' through!

350
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:46,561
Careful, watch your step.

351
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:48,271
[NAMI]
Thanks.

352
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:50,106
[NAMI]
Now comes the tricky part.

353
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,025
Looks like our only
choice is to cut through

354
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:55,070
this side of the base and hope
those Marines don't spot us.

355
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:57,989
With the way they're searching
the bay, we'd better hurry!

356
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:00,033
Sanji! We gotta move!

357
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:01,326
[SANJI]
Right!

358
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:07,582
We're almost there! Sweet,
sweet gold, here I come!

359
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:10,710
Straight ahead. Through
that doorway, guys!

360
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:12,504
[USOPP laughs]

361
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:13,838
[LUFFY laughs]

362
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:15,632
[USOPP] I bet it's at
the end of this corridor!

363
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:18,968
[laughing] Yay, gold!

364
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:20,845
[ROBIN]
Making it here was too easy.

365
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,347
Something's not right.

366
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,708
Heh.

367
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:53,253
[NAMI]
Clear.

368
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,756
[door closes]

369
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,009
Uh! Pirates!

370
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:01,094
Freeze! Don't move another inch!

371
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:02,679
I mean it!

372
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:05,181
[SANJI] Just calm down. We're
not here to blow the fortress up

373
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:06,725
or kill you and your friends,

374
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:09,602
so why don't you point that
pigsticker somewhere else, 'kay?

375
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:10,729
[NEW RECRUIT]
Quiet!

376
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:13,523
I will not let any
pirates sabotage G8!

377
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:15,859
Didn't you hear him?
We're not gonna do that!

378
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:17,861
[NEW RECRUIT] Like I could
trust the word of a pirate!

379
00:17:17,944 --> 00:17:19,446
Stay back! I'm warning you!

380
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:22,657
I've been trained to do whatever
it takes to defend this base!

381
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:26,536
So, then, in other words, you're
willing to risk your life?

382
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,662
[NEW RECRUIT]
Of course!

How noble. It's just
too bad your training

386
00:17:36,504 --> 00:17:39,090
obviously didn't teach
you how to dodge a kick.

387
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,474
[USOPP whimpers]

388
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:51,144
Whoa! That thing's awesome!

389
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:52,562
Wow!

390
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:54,773
Some serious security.

391
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:55,648
Yeah!

392
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:57,192
And you know what that means!

393
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:59,402
This has gotta be the place
where they took our treasure!

394
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:01,821
Hey, maybe we'll find
lots of other good stuff

395
00:18:01,905 --> 00:18:03,323
in there besides our gold!

396
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:05,158
So, now what?

397
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:06,201
[LUFFY]
Hm.

Oh! Um, sorry!

--Sorry?
--That's what I said.

402
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:18,463
[USOPP] You can't open
a vault like that!

403
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:21,257
He-he. It requires
a more delicate touch!

404
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:22,967
What you gotta do
is turn these dials

405
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,511
to the correct
combination first!

406
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:26,429
When you do that,
the gears above turn,

407
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:28,556
the bolt comes undone,
and then voilá!

408
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,101
The door opens as easy as pie!

409
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:33,520

[shrieks]

411
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,108
That's far enough!

412
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,252
So, they were waiting for us.

413
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:59,170
[ROBIN]
It would seem so.

414
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,423
Just give up,
you're trapped like rats!

415
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:03,049
There's no chance of escape!

416
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,759
Surrender and we-- [grunts]

417

What? And just give up our gold?

418
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:09,973
No way! We'll take on
each and every one of you!

419
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:14,144
[USOPP]
Okay, take it from here, guys!

[USOPP]
Can I?

432

Breaking in is really Nami's
specialty, but don't worry!

433
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:52,098
This lock should be
a piece of cake for Usopp,

434
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:53,683
the master safecracker!

435
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,727
Hm. Yes!

too much, they'll cut 'em off!

Good. Tell them to hold their
positions until further orders!
