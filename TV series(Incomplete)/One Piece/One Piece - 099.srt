00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,479
A sign of peaceful times.

177
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,448
[TOTO]
And will you be joining us?

178
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,250
No, no, that's quite all right.

179
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,852
I packed a lunch today. Bye!

180
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:55,761
[COBRA]
Shh!

181
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,265
Your Majesty! What are
you doing here?!

182
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,602
Cobra! My lord! Ugh...

183
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,870
I asked you not to
follow me again.

184
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,439
Yeah, it's just,

185
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:10,042
I wanted to make sure my
precious daughter's okay.

186
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,377
[growls]

187
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,345
Go home, Sire!

188
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,947
I can't babysit you
and Princess Vivi, too!

189
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,349
What?!

190
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,818
Go home! You heard me!

191
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,963
What a sweet story, Vivi.

192
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,299
[USOPP]
Luffy, stop it!

193
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,568
You gimme that water
back right this minute!

194
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,904
Just wait. I haven't gotten
to the best part yet.

195
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,915
[BAD GUYS laughing]

196
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,751
Hello, Princess!

197
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,388
You lost, little girl?
We'll help you out.

198
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,659
Protect her, Sand‐Sand Clan!

199
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,560
[KIDS yelling]

200
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,529
[BAD GUY A] What the hell's
wrong with these kids?!

201
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,998
They won't give up!

202
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,700
Leader! Guys!

203
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:08,768
Vivi! Get going!

204
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,103
We're trying to hold these
guys off for you! Go!

205
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,039
Vivi, get outta here right now!

206
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,607
Yeah, you gotta run, now!

207
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,909
I can't... Leader!

208
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,944
[BAD GUY A laughs]

209
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,112
We're not here to kill you.

210
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,416
We just wanna kidnap you for
a ransom from your father,

211
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,518
but these other kids...

212
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,354
Damn!

213
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:32,024
Okay. Now just come with
us quietly, Princess Vivi.

214
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,128
[BOTH laugh]

215
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,863
[KOZA]
Step back!

216
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,132
Protect her to the death,
Sand‐Sand Clan!

217
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,937
[KIDS yelling]

218
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,592
Ah! What the heck is that?!

219
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,729
It looks like a tail!

220
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:14,834
Hello there. Don't be
shy. Come on... out!

221
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,908
[USOPP screams]

222
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,512
It's huge!

223
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,986
[USOPP screaming]

224
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,758
Vivi, please continue
telling the story.

225
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,127
I'm getting hooked on your
adventures with Koza.

226
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,094
All right.

227
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,963
See, Koza had a strong heart

228
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,599
that burned as
bright as the sun.

229
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,000
But I worried that
his compassion

230
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,636
would one day be
used against him.

231
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,671
[KOZA]
Don't give up!

232
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,940
We're not beat yet.
Keep fighting!

233
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:59,979
[KIDS shouting]

234
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:07,686
[VIVI gasps]

00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,121
[BAD GUY C laughs]

236
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,157
Stupid kids. Lookie here.

237
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,059
Oh, crap! Another one?!

238
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,661
[BAD GUY C screams]

239
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,531
Ah! Damn it! She's getting away!

240
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,569
Well, lookie there!
She's in the ruins!

241
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,839
Let's get 'em!

242
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,140
[KIDS yelling]

243
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,642
Move it!

244
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,914
What happened?

245
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:41,187
[KIDS groaning]

246
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,189
Hey. Boy, what happened to you?

247
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:47,059
Hey, kid. Where's princess Vivi?

248
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:50,362
Vivi got kidnapped by three men.

249
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,898
Oh, no!

250
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,368
Bad guys. Went in the old ruins.
Koza followed them in there.

251
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,737
He's trying to save
the vice‐leader.

252
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,739
Oh, yeah?

253
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,678
[BAD GUY B]
Oh, Princess!

254
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,913
Where did you go, little girl?!

255
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,281
Let's play a game.

256
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,050
[BAD GUY C] Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

257
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,220
[BAD GUY B] Yeah! Come out,
come out wherever you are.

258
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,922
Little Vivi!
You can stop hiding!

259
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,258
We aren't gonna hurt you!

260
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:30,236
Found ya, little princess!

261
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,303
There you are, girl.

262
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,106
Don't go and run off
again on me now!

263
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,209
[KOZA]
Gotcha!

264
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,713
[gasps] Leader!

265
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,282
Vivi, are you okay?!

266
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,785
[VIVI]
Yes. I'm fine. Just‐‐

267
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,955
Stay down, punk, unless
you want another beating!

268
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,725
I'll never surrender the
princess, you got that?!

269
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:57,296
Hey, kid, shut your damn mouth
and hand over my meal ticket.

270
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,300
I'm done playing games
with you little brats.

271
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,735
[VIVI]
It's a sword.

272
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,404
Let's run! Koza!

273
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,640
Don't worry, Princess,
he's harmless.

274
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,074
Huh?!

275
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:17,182
[KOZA] Protect her to the
death, Sand‐Sand Clan!

276
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,351
Leader! Please stop it!

277
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,654
I'm warning you.

278
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,825

Leader!

284
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,397
[BAD GUY B]
No way.

285
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,835
That damn little kid managed
to knock out our boss!

286
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,203
How dare he.

287
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:14,173
It's time to make
that little brat pay.

288
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,309
You. You're dead, boy!

289
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,712
[COBRA, IGARAM yell]

290
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,148
[COBRA]
Take that, bastards!

291
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,751
Papa! Igaram!

292
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,320
‐‐Princess Vivi! Are you okay?
‐‐How dare you punks!

293
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,523
You desert garbage dare
to kidnap my daughter?

294
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,159
You dirty swine!

295
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,064
[CHAKA] We took care
of the others, Sire.

296
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:43,402
Chaka! Pell? My friends,
why are you two here?

297
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,403
[CHAKA]
That's funny.

298
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,538
We were going to ask
you the same question.

299
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,341
[PELL] What would drive a king
to travel so far from home?

300
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,443
These areas are a haven
for many bandits.

301
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,247
It's not a place for royalty.

302
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,049
Igaram! Koza's hurt!

303
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:00,119
Yes. He needs immediate
medical attention.

304
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,388
The others are also
in dire need.

305
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,523
Pell! Chaka!
Arrange help at once!

306
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,125
[CHAKA, PELL]
Sir!

307
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,228
You children acted very brave.

308
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,101
[COBRA]
What's wrong, Vivi?

309
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,405
Why are you so distant, child?

310
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:23,409
[VIVI]
I was... just so scared.

311
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,310
[KOZA]
I was scared too.

312
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,212
They were so much bigger
and stronger than us,

313
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,448
and armed to the teeth.

314
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,483
[VIVI]
It's not that...

315
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,618
It's just...

316
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:36,488
Leader, you told them to
protect me... to the death.

317
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,958
Protect her to the death,
Sand‐Sand Clan.

318
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,900
Don't give your life
to save mine, Leader.

319
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,236
[IGARAM]
Poor Vivi.

320
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,940
Her greatest fear is
losing her friends.

321
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,453
[COBRA] Vivi may be a little
girl, but she's also a princess.

322
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,456
Koza, the full measure
of gratitude I owe you

323
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,826
cannot be expressed,
so I will simply say...

324
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,427
Thank you.

325
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:19,631
But Vivi is one of my friends.
I would do that for all of them.

326
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,833
I see.

327
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,335
Then I'm certain the next
generation of Alabasta's people

328
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,437
will be in good hands.

329
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,172
Do you love this country?

330
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,142
Yes. This is my home!

331
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,111
Mine as well!

332
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,981
[IGARAM]
Excuse me.

333
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,183
Ma, ma, maaa!

334
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,853
There is an important matter
that concerns me greatly.

335
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,654
[COBRA]
What's that?

336
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,023
[IGARAM] Those who are to lead
their countrymen must be able

337
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,026
to make life and death
decisions without hesitation.

338
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,394
Vivi is far too tenderhearted

339
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,164
for such crushing
responsibility.

340
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,532
Sir Igaram.

341
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,467
Sire?

342
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,368
Just relax.

343
00:18:56,368 --> 00:19:00,372
Because as I see it,
Alabasta is safe.

344
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,247
[IGARAM] Your Majesty,
it is my greatest desire

345
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,015
to serve you until my death.

346
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,419
Yuba?

347
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,521
Exactly!

348
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,489
And that news comes directly
from your dad to mine

349
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,824
so you know it's true.

350
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,726
Oh, wow! That's great!

351
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,694
Your dad asked mine
to start a town.

352
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:26,064
He said it would be built
at the Yuba Oasis!

353
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,768
That's considered the
crossroads of Alabasta,

354
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,937
where every merchant and
traveler must pass through.

355
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,407
It's the perfect location!

356
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,543
You just wait
until it's finished.

357
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,711
This town will bring
good fortune and joy

358
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,047
to so many people.

359
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,884
Amazing!

360
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,019
And that's not even
the best part!

361
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,922
My dad is going to be the
mayor of the whole thing!

362
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,557
You're going too, Koza?

363
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,591
Of course!

364
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,894
But my dad wants me to
stay here in the capital.

365
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,596
He says life will be too hard.

366
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,766
But I just gotta be where all
the action is! And live it!

367
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,069
I wanna help build the city
with my own two hands.

368
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,873
Alabasta will need the
city of Yuba to survive.

369
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,952
We're counting on you, Toto.

370
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,753
Yes, yes, Your Majesty!

371
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,990
We'll make Yuba a great
city for Alabasta.

372
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,960
So long, my princess.
We won't see you for a while.

373
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:31,830
As soon as Yuba's up and
running, stop by, Princess.

374
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,099
Yes. Of course I will.

375
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,834
It's gonna be the
best town ever!

376
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,735
When it's up and running,

377
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,971
I'll personally give
ya the grand tour!

378
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,906
[CARAVAN LEADER]
Let's move out!

379
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,507
See ya, Vivi!

380
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,144
I hope ya grow up to
become a great princess!

381
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,913
Okay!

382
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,184
[TOTO]
Koza, stop being so arrogant.

383
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,619
[KOZA]
Oww!

384
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,923
Koza is correct about Yuba.

385
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:01,960
This new city will bring great
prosperity to the kingdom.

386
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:09,167
So, Koza went with his father
to found the city of Yuba.

387
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,637
Does this have something
to do with the rebel army?

388
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,206
Uh‐huh. That's right.

389
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,208
We're heading toward
the oasis of Yuba.

390
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,477
That's where the
rebel army is stationed.

391
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,179
The leader of the rebel
insurgents is named...

392
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,648
...Koza.

393
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,615
So that means‐‐!

394
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,484
[VIVI]
Mh‐hm.

395
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,120
It's the same boy
from the story.

396
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,492
Nami, look! I managed to
save you the best part!

397
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,826
[NAMI, VIVI scream]

398
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,230
This desert shrimp is so good!

399
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,867
It's not shrimp!
It's a scorpion!

400
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,170
[LUFFY]
Ugh... I'm so full.

401
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,739
You guys are a buncha
inconsiderate jerks!

402
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,708
Let's go, Eyelash!

403
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,212
Whoa. Why is she so angry?

404
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,982
[USOPP, ZORO, CHOPPER]

[USOPP] Ace doesn't seem like
the wanted criminal type, huh?

420
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,967
[NAMI] Yet, every single
pirate the world over

421
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,668
fears the name "Fire Fist Ace."

422
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,971
[VIVI] Ace is chasing some
pirate named Blackbeard!

423
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,239
I wonder what he's like.

424
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,341
[SANJI] I heard that only one
person has defeated Blackbeard.

425
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,276
[ZORO] Yeah, Scorpion.
He's a bounty hunter.

426
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,812
[CHOPPER] Wow, Scorpion
must be really strong!
