1
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,408
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:41,244
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:42,979
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:43,012 --> 00:02:45,648
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,317
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,153
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:51,688
after eating the
Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,657
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,527
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,229
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,697
of the World Government,

12
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,268
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,704
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:10,640
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:14,043
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue.

16
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:20,083
The crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,453
[NARRATOR]
Separated from his crew,

18
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:26,656
Luffy and his newfound cohorts
have hijacked a Navy ship

19
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:28,524
in order to rescue
his brother, Ace,

20
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:32,962
who's been transported
to Navy HQ for execution.

21
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:35,565
[MAGELLAN] You've been condemned
and your sentence is final.

22
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,101
There is naught but despair
on the path before you,

23
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,103
however you may struggle.

24
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,738
Can't you see you're
wasting your time?

25
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:43,539
For filthy criminals
such as you...

26
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,509
...the Gates of Justice
will never open!

27
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:49,245
You're sure?

28
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:52,248
You want to open the Gates of
Justice at a time like this?

29
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:55,351
All this time, and you knew...

30
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:59,989
I got you! [laughs]
You silly man!

31
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:03,593
[LUFFY]
Bon! Answer me!

32
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,997
[LUFFY] This is it.
The gate's about to close.

33
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:12,068
We have... to go.

34
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:15,305
[whimpers] So thank you!

35
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,539
[MARINE H]
The gate is closing!

36
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:19,008
[MARINE I]
Keep firing! Take them out!

37
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:21,611
[MAGELLAN] Any last words
before I eliminate you?

38
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:23,413
Have at me!

39
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:27,116
[NARRATOR] Luffy has
successfully broken out

40
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,753
of the world's most
impenetrable prison, Impel Down.

41
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:35,591
Although, the end of his
battle is nowhere in sight.

42
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,164
[LUFFY]
"To the Navy Headquarters!

43
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,066
Off to Rescue Ace!"

44
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:54,544
[SHIRYU]
Living dangerously is one thing,

45
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:56,479
living carelessly, another.

46
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:59,315
If I'd lacked the foresight
to bring an antidote,

47
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:02,285
I'd be stumbling over
your corpses right now.

48
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:04,487
Don't ever underestimate
Magellan.

49
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,524
[BURGESS laughs]
But, we're here!

50
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,060
You shouldn't dismiss
your own inclusion.

51
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:14,464
Your presence is a factor
in our fate as well.

52
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:19,235
Ha, ha, ha. Though, he's right.
I was sure I was a dead man.

53
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:23,339
We're lucky we're all
[coughs] still alive.

54
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:31,347
Well, It ain't up to us
whether we live or die.

55
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:35,651
Fearin' death is the
fastest way to lose.

56
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:42,558
[laughs] Just live while ya can,
even if it kills ya. Right?

57
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,340
Still. Don't think I ain't
grateful for ya help.

58
00:05:57,373 --> 00:06:00,710
'Cuz I am. And again,
welcome to our gang.

59
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:02,745
I bet we'll make a great team.

60
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,249
I don't see much future
for myself in this crypt.

61
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,751
You're exactly the sort of
person I've wanted to meet,

62
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,719
for some time.

63
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:15,191
[BLACKBEARD laughs]

64
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,602
Gather round, men.
The time has come.

65
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,172
Let's raise a toast to
our unprecedented escape

66
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:31,774
from Impel Down! To us!

67
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,678
[CREW]
To us! To us! To us!

68
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:47,857
Damn! Missed that!

69
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:57,567
I'm afraid we'll have to do
without Inazuma from here.

70
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,268
[MAN A]
Wait, are you trying to tell us

71
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:01,170
the infection is that serious?

72
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:05,174
I was lucky that Magellan hit me
with only one type of poison.

73
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,276
I was able to flush
it out of my system

74
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,413
using my healing
and energy hormones.

75
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:13,749
[inahles] Hee-haw!

76
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:15,718
[IVANKOV]
It's an ambivalent fix, though.

77
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,920
One hormone will
take years off my life

78
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:20,556
while the other causes
severe side effects.

79
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,726
So for him, the best thing
possible is good old-fashioned,

80
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,462
bed-rest and natural
rehabilitation.

81
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:28,631
Nothing can help you
to regain the years lost

82
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:29,899
by using the hormone.

83
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:34,337
Inazuma is an indispensable New
Kama of the revolutionary army.

84
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,404
We need him healthy.

85
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:39,041
So we have to make sure
he recovers slow and easy.

86
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:51,687
[MR. 3 sighs]
Now that I think about it,

87
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,091
he wasn't such a pain
in the butt after all.

88
00:07:55,124 --> 00:08:01,397
He was such a good guy.
And he got caught saving us.

89
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,902
Brother Bon!

90
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:06,836
Brother Bon...

91
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:08,371
Brother Bon!

92
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,774
[CREW]
Brother Bon!

93
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:22,852
Hey, c'mon, guys,
it's sad and all,

94
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,054
but ya can't waste yer
whole lives mourning.

95
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,491
He was great, but now he's dead
and that's the way it is.

96
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:33,462
So, all we can do is party!
That's what he would want!

97
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,932
[BUGGY laughs]

98
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:40,102
So, there ya go, it can double
as a funeral for Mr. 2.

99
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:44,140
[BUGGY groans]
What's the big idea?

100
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:47,510
It's the truth and you know it!

101
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:48,878
Hey! For all we know,

102
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:51,480
there's still a chance Bon
didn't even get killed.

103
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:52,415
You big nose!

104
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,183
Whoa, hey, what did
you just say to me?

105
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:57,954
You got a big stupid nose to go
along with your big stupid face!

106
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,188
Oh?

107
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:01,457
Well, how 'bout I stretch your
stupid face until it snaps?

108
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,126
Oh, blow it out
your giant nose!

109
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,163
If you ask me, they
both look like idiots.

110
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,738
[CROCODILE] Fancy trick how
you rallied those sharks.

111
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:18,741
How'd ya do it? I was under
the impression only mermaids

112
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:20,676
had the ability
to speak to fish.

113
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,046
But that impression
is clearly incorrect.

114
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,114
Is that odd?

115
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,517
A fishman being
friends with fish?

116
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:31,120
Well, it's not the
usual, I know that.

117
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,090
You're a strange one, huh?

118
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:36,859
A misfit of the savage species.

119
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:40,930
Fine. I'll take that as
a compliment of sorts.

120
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:44,233
Yes, it's true, fishmen
do have a violent nature.

121
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,868
Bon is not dead, dammit!

122
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:47,803
[BUGGY groaning]

123
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,674
[PRISONERS] Whoa! Captain Buggy
grew another big, red nose!

124
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:54,777
[JIMBEI]
Luffy.

125
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,878
[LUFFY]
Huh?

126
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:58,214
[JIMBEI] I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for you.

127
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:01,250
You gave me the chance
to rescue Ace.

128
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:04,020
And I owe you a great debt.

129
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:07,223
Don't think about it
like that. We're even.

130
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:09,625
And besides,
you're super strong.

131
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:12,194
I'm just happy to have
you on the team!

132
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:14,630
[JIMBEI] I wish I could
thank him properly,

133
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:19,201
and apologize for my involvement
in that unfortunate situation.

134
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:24,273
But no, this isn't the time.
We have enough to worry

135
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:28,544
about for now. I only hope
my strength will be enough.

136
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:30,813
I may be one of
the Seven Warlords,

137
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:33,082
but they'll strip me
of my title after this.

138
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:35,017
Now let's make Navy
Headquarters regret

139
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,920
they ever laid hands on Ace!

140
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,656
We must do right
by our fallen.

141
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,593
We'll make your friend proud
and rescue Ace at any cost!

142
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:45,661
Warlord?

143
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:47,797
Navy Headquarters?

144
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,132
[BOTH]
What?!

145
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,267
Whoa, really?

146
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,270
You-You're seriously
a Warlord? Jeez!

147
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:56,105
No wonder you're so strong!

148
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:01,644
Yes. I suppose I should've
told you sooner.

149
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,746
Everybody else knew that.

150
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,116
[BUGGY] Hey! What's all this
talk about Navy Headquarters?!

151
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,251
Don't tell me we escaped
from the bowels of hell

152
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:12,221
just to head straight back
into the jaws of the beast!

153
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,289
I'm afraid so.

154
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:16,092
Screw you!
Nobody is that crazy!

155
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,960
Surely you guys heard
about the war brewing

156
00:11:17,993 --> 00:11:20,029
between Whitebeard and the Navy!

157
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:21,130
Uh. War?

158
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:22,665
Navy Headquarters?

159
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:25,201
Don't act like it's
a big surprise.

160
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:26,936
Not our fault you're so dense.

161
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,204
[BUGGY]
Say what?!

162
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:30,172
Well, we passed through
the Gate of Justice.

163
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:31,107
Isn't that right?

164
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,777
Our destination is Enies
Lobby or Navy HQ.

165
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,180
This Tub Current is restricted
to Government passage only.

166
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:40,116
It's one giant whirlpool
that connects

167
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:42,351
the Government's three
major facilities.

168
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:45,254
The reason we busted out now
is cause we have a role to play

169
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,990
in this war. So you
best get used to it.

170
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:49,091
[BUGGY, MR. 3 gasping]

171
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,595
Yeah! The real fight's
about to start.

172
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,462
[BOTH]
Real fight?!

173
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:55,264
Then what do you
call that back there?!

174
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,067
[PRISONERS] No way!
No one told us about this!

175
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,901
Stop!

176
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:00,669
Turn this ship around,
you bastard!

177
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:01,737
Please, stop!

178
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:04,039
There's no stopping and
there's no turning around.

179
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:05,908
Not while the ship's
on the current.

180
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,144
If you're scared,
just get off.

181
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:09,044
[BUGGY]
Okay, good idea...

182
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:11,680
[MR. 3] Yeah! Good
luck with your war!

183
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,649
[BOTH]
We can't do that, moron!

184
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:16,352
That would kill us! We both
have Devil Fruit powers!

185
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:20,055
Navy HQ, the Warlords, and...
the Whitebeard Pirates

186
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:21,957
all fighting each
other at once?

187
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,126
Nobody can survive that!

188
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,912
I've heard enough.
Please take me back!

189
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:44,914
I'd rather be in prison
than this war!

190
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:45,981
[PRISONER E crying]

191
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,717
All of us from New Kama
Land knew about this plan.

192
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:51,287
Uh! Then why the hell
didn't you tell us?

193
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,124
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Pudda Pudda Pudda Pudda.

194
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:57,126
This's it! We're all dead!

195
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,361
Mommy!

196
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:08,704
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Pudda Pudda Pudda Pudda.

197
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:12,308
Hey. What is that?
You guys hear it?

198
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:20,349
Uh.

199
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,226
It's a Transponder Snail.

200
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:31,961
But who's callin'?

201
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:35,397
Don't you get it? Think!
We're on a Navy ship.

202
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:36,932
Huh?

203
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:51,046
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Pudda Pudda Pudda Pudda.

204
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,208
[gasps]

205
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:18,332
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Pudda Pudda Pudda Pudda.

206
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:21,360
[ALL]
Huh?!

207
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,819
Let's just act
like no one's here.

208
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:41,455
Pudda Pudda Pudda
Pudda Pudda, cuh-lick.

209
00:14:41,488 --> 00:14:42,856
Uh. Hello?

210
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,258
[CREW]
He answered it!

211
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,227
[MARINE A]
Greetings from Navy HQ.

212
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,962
Hey, Luffy here.

213
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:49,863
[CREW]
Idiot! Don't say that!

214
00:14:49,897 --> 00:14:51,298
Listen, kid we're aware

215
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:53,801
that the ship has been
hijacked by escapees.

216
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:57,805
We received a report from Impel
Down. So let's be honest here.

217
00:14:57,838 --> 00:15:01,842
Before contact was lost, we had
insider information being fed

218
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,245
to us. Based on this,
we've determined

219
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,014
who the two ringleaders
behind the breakout are.

220
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:08,148
Two?

221
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:11,151
[MARINE A] You, the pirate
known as Straw Hat Luffy.

222
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:14,822
And another notorious
pirate. Buggy the Clown.

223
00:15:14,855 --> 00:15:16,757
[BUGGY]
Uh... Huh?

224
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,358
[CREW]
What?

225
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:18,859
Wait, what? Ringleader?

226
00:15:18,892 --> 00:15:19,693
[PRISONER N]
Seriously?

227
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:21,128
[PRISONER O]
We've got Warlords here,

228
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:23,831
and their main suspect
is Captain Buggy?

229
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:26,166
Who the hell are you?
Come clean with us!

230
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,469
No! Why me?

231
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:30,237
[MARINE A]
Pass me the documents.

232
00:15:30,271 --> 00:15:31,839
--[MARINE B] Here.
--[MARINE A] Thank you.

233
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:34,775
At first, we just assumed
that the clown was another

234
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:39,079
two-bit criminal. But to
be frank, we... were wrong.

235
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:42,216
We learned he was a crewmember
on the ship of Gold Roger,

236
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:43,550
King of the Pirates.

237
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:46,020
Ah! They found me out!

238
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:47,521
[CREW]
What?

239
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:49,223
[PRISONER Q]
You crewed on the Oro Jackson?

240
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:50,858
[MAN C]
Unbelievable!

241
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:53,394
[WOMAN D] You're a star!
A star among pirates!

242
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:55,296
[MARINE A]
Oh, and there's one other thing.

243
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,831
He's an ally of one of
the Four Emperors.

244
00:15:57,865 --> 00:15:59,933
His name is Red Haired Shanks.

245
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:01,969
[CREW]
Are you serious?!

246
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,071
[MARINE A]
So if you can hear us, Buggy,

247
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:06,240
we don't know how someone
with your background has

248
00:16:06,273 --> 00:16:07,441
laid low for so long,

249
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:12,313
but you've most certainly
stepped into the spotlight now.

250
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,814
Well...

251
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,082
[MARINE A] We haven't
defined your connection

252
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:18,919
with "Fire Fist" Ace yet, but
we're sure you share the same

253
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:23,123
goal with Straw Hat Luffy,
to rescue him from execution.

254
00:16:23,157 --> 00:16:25,859
Not... really...

255
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:28,195
[MARINE A] We know that you're
accompanied by Jimbei,

256
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:31,965
Crocodile, Ivankov. Not to
mention the more than 200

257
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,101
average, run-of-the-mill
ruffians you tricked

258
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:35,903
into following your lead.

259
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:37,604
Now let me explain your future.

260
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:41,375
Your fates depend on whether
we open the Gate of Justice.

261
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:44,578
As long as we leave it closed,
you can't get to Marineford.

262
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:47,247
You can't even get out
of the Tub Current.

263
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:49,183
You will be completely stranded.

264
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,885
There is no sea for
you to escape to.

265
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,420
[BUGGY whimpers]

266
00:16:53,454 --> 00:16:56,223
[MARINE A] Better get used to
your surroundings. That's all.

267
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:57,624
Hey! Wait! Navy!

268
00:16:57,658 --> 00:16:58,559
[MARINE A]
Huh?

269
00:16:58,592 --> 00:17:01,562
[inahles]

270
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:05,265
I'm gonna rescue Ace
no matter what!

271
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:08,035
Better keep your
potatoes peeled!

272
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:10,971
Our what?

273
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,975
--[TRANSPONDER SNAIL] Cah-lick!
--[CREW] Ah!

274
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:15,909
[LUFFY]
Hmph.

275
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:17,945
What? The saying's
keep your eyes peeled!

276
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:19,646
[PRISONER R] Now I'm
gonna be craving potatoes!

277
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,949
Thanks a lot, pal!

278
00:17:21,982 --> 00:17:24,485
He just tried to pick
a fight with Navy HQ.

279
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:25,953
Forget the potatoes!

280
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:28,555
[MAN G] Wait. I've gotta
know, Captain Buggy...

281
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,325
Were you honestly a member
of Gold Roger's crew?

282
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:33,927
[PRISONER S] And a sworn
brother of Red-Haired Shanks?

283
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,195
You should've said!

284
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:37,664
You're one hell of a
pirate, Captain Buggy!

285
00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:38,465
[CREW cheers]

286
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:41,135
[BUGGY]
Now. Hold on! Aw, dammit!

287
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:43,337
The Government's never gonna
let me outta their sights

288
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,972
now that the truth's out!

289
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:47,408
Not the background I
was expecting from him.

290
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,676
And yet he's so weak.

291
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,345
[CROCODILE grunts]

292
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,348
That pedigree,
and he's so petty?

293
00:17:54,381 --> 00:17:57,584
Every ship has one.
A little blemish, I mean.

294
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,053
[CREW]
Mm-hm.

295
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:01,555
Shut yer mouths!

296
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:03,624
You know. Actually...

297
00:18:03,657 --> 00:18:08,395
Perhaps you've heard of a pirate
named Buggy from the East Blue.

298
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:11,598
[LUFFY] The old Vice Captain
guy said somethin' about you.

299
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,601
Huh? The Vice Captain?

300
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,704
[LUFFY] Yeah, the old guy,
Rayleigh. You know him, right?

301
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:21,241
Do I! Are you saying that you've
actually seen Rayleigh?

302
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:24,678
Oh, man. I miss that guy.
Where'd you see him?

303
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:27,514
They're talking about
Dark King Rayleigh.

304
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:29,583
Like it's no big deal.

305
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:32,386
Holy crap! Captain Buggy.

306
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:34,588
I knew you were
the genuine article!

307
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:37,191
[BUGGY]
No! Look, not so fast!

308
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:39,059
Everything is true, yes, but!

309
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:41,528
You can't go spreadin'
this around willy nilly.

310
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:43,730
We gotta think about
my future as a pirate!

311
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:44,932
[PRISONER V]
Wow!

312
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:48,168
I can't believe you were a
member of such a legendary crew!

313
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:50,170
[CREW]
Buggy! Buggy! Buggy! Buggy!

314
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:55,042
Hey, listen to me, you
fools! Shut up, already!

315
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:57,077
I was an apprentice, that's all!

316
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,746
You can't worship
me for that! C'mon!

317
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:05,219
Knock it off! I'm not
bein' humble, just stop!

318
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:08,655
[BUGGY groans] I don't feel
as bad as I thought I would.

319
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,326
Oh. Wait a minute! Sure,
the Navy has completely

320
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,128
overestimated me, but maybe
that's not such a bad thing.

321
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:19,166
Maybe. That's because
it's all true!

322
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,402
I've got a pretty good
reputation goin' for me here.

323
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:27,207
If only there was some way...

324
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:30,244
If I could defeat Whitebeard,
maybe I could become one

325
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:34,615
of the Four Emperors! Hell yes!
Wait, no, no, no, no.

326
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:39,720
I would need to become
the King of the Pirates!

327
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:42,456
It's perfect! Some of
these guys've probably

328
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:44,591
got higher bounties on
their heads than I do.

329
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,394
If I play my cards just right...

330
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:51,565
[BUGGY]
I can do this!

331
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:53,033
[PRISONER W]
Captain Buggy!

332
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,669
We'll follow you until
the day we die!

333
00:19:55,702 --> 00:19:57,671
[CREW cheers]

334
00:19:57,704 --> 00:19:59,273
Just give us an order!

335
00:19:59,306 --> 00:20:01,208
Like steal this ship from
the guys who stole it!

336
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,609
We don't have to go to Navy HQ!

337
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:06,179
That's right! And then...
we'll be free!

338
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:08,248
[PRISONER Z]
Sorry to do it, Straw Hat!

339
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:10,417
But we're takin'
control of this ship!

340
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,353
We already broke outta prison,
and we don't want dying

341
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:14,688
to be the next thing we do!

342
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:18,525
Surrender now. We've got
Captain Buggy on our side!

343
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,563
--Tell 'em, Captain Buggy!
--[CREW] Buggy! Buggy!

344
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,565
Not good...

345
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:29,169
Only one way to
handle this. Kill 'em.

346
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:34,708
I'm good. I've got this!
I really think I can do it!

347
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:39,546
[CREW]
Buggy! Buggy! Buggy! Buggy!

348
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:50,524
That's enough!
Don't get too flashy!

349
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:54,161
You guys are high on power
and acting impulsively.

350
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:56,563
No matter what, this
ship's not stopping!

351
00:20:56,597 --> 00:20:59,132
We're headed straight
for the heart of the war.

352
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,668
And you guys are already
on board, aren't you?

353
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:04,438
Think about what that
means for a second!

354
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,873
In no time at all,
we'll come face to face

355
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:10,210
with the man standing with
his foot on top of the world!

356
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:11,678
Chances like this
don't come around

357
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:14,581
more than once in a lifetime.

358
00:21:14,615 --> 00:21:18,452
So listen, I want all of you
to live out a dream with me.

359
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:22,356
For today... I'll
conquer Whitebeard,

360
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:24,391
and thus, rule the world!

361
00:21:24,424 --> 00:21:28,595
[CREW]
Yeah! Captain Buggy!

362
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,671
[PRISONER DD]
Captain Buggy! Thank you,

363
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:40,340
the darkness of hell
had beaten us down.

364
00:21:40,374 --> 00:21:42,576
You've saved us.
Gave us light!

365
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:44,745
We almost lost the
most important thing!

366
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:47,147
[PRISONER FF]
Yes! Our dreams!

367
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,182
You've let us dream again!

368
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:51,585
[PRISONER GG] I'll follow
you anywhere, Captain Buggy!

369
00:21:51,618 --> 00:21:54,588
[PRISONER HH] To hell with
living a peaceful life!

370
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:57,724
[BUGGY]
All right then!

371
00:21:57,758 --> 00:22:01,762
Now let's win this war,
you guys! To Navy HQ!

372
00:22:01,795 --> 00:22:04,698
[CREW]
Buggy! Buggy! Buggy!

373
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:06,800
So I guess the
mutiny's over?

374
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,803
Then he's not entirely
useless, I suppose.

375
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:13,273
[PRISONER II] You're gonna rule
the world, Captain! I know it!

376
00:22:13,306 --> 00:22:15,709
[PRISONER JJ] I'm with
you to the bitter end!

377
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:19,246
[BUGGY laughs]
That's right, you are!

378
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,151
Let them have fun
while they can.

379
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,388
[MARINE C] The ship
transporting Portgas D. Ace

380
00:22:28,422 --> 00:22:30,624
will arrive at
Marineford shortly.

381
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:33,226
Ah. Perfect.

382
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,702
[MARINE E] Right this way,
please board the ship.

383
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,837
There's plenty of room,
so don't worry.

384
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,939
We'll get everyone on board.

385
00:22:49,776 --> 00:22:52,746
[MARINE F] Prepare to
receive the prisoner!

386
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:22,409
[NARRATOR] Nami, traveling on
the Sky Island of Weatheria,

387
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,977
heads for the Grand Line.

388
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,546
But the pace of the island's
travel makes it unlikely

389
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,749
that she'll ever reunite
with her friends.

390
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,984
Meanwhile, will
Franky be stuck

391
00:23:31,017 --> 00:23:33,653
as a tea-drinking
gentleman forever?

392
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:35,388
[LUFFY]
On the next, One Piece.

393
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:36,857
"The Friends' Whereabouts!

394
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,659
The Weatheria Report and
the Cyborg Animals!"

395
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:42,863
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates!
