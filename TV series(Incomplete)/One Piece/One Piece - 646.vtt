00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.330
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:42.905
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.344 --> 00:02:37.882
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.788
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:45.998
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.504
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:51.777
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.614
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.647 --> 00:02:56.019
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:59.058
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:03.501
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.136
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.877
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:13.152
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:14.957 --> 00:03:16.359
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:18.196
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.467
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.606
Their current objective
is to destroy

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.578
a man-made Devil Fruit Factory
in the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.611 --> 00:03:28.416
Soon, Luffy becomes
sidetracked by a tournament

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.722
with the Flame Flame Fruit
as a prize.

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:33.359
He's registered in
the match for Block C--

00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:36.567
a furious battle royale
that is now underway.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.604
You okay, bro?

00:03:38.637 --> 00:03:43.179
That... That bastard had the
nerve to call me a shrimp?

00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:47.321
Hurry up, Bobby.
Put it on... for me!

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:51.362
[JEAN] You know, heard a
very peculiar tale, Lucy.

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:54.402
A rumor about a pirate
with a 400 million bounty

00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:56.506
by the name of Straw Hat Luffy.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.911
Who secretly entered
this competition.

00:03:58.944 --> 00:04:00.848
[LUFFY grunting]

00:04:04.288 --> 00:04:08.029
[LUFFY] "The Legendary Pirate!
Don Chin Jao!"

00:04:11.803 --> 00:04:15.177
[GYATS] The battle of Block C
is reaching its climax!

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.447
But which of these
capable contenders

00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:19.820
will take home the prize?

00:04:19.853 --> 00:04:23.159
Kelly Funk, the assassin
from Mogaro, looks promising!

00:04:23.192 --> 00:04:26.834
He seems unstoppable! Just look
at what he did to Boo!

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:29.305
Knocked him out cold!

00:04:29.338 --> 00:04:31.610
I see Sai's approaching him now.

00:04:31.643 --> 00:04:35.117
Will our second Hasshoken
master fare any better?

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.390
Meanwhile, Ideo keeps on
blowing through his opponents

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:40.159
like they're made of glass!

00:04:40.193 --> 00:04:42.230
It's gonna take some
serious manpower

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:44.769
to defeat a guy with
punches like that!

00:04:44.803 --> 00:04:46.740
Then there's Don Chin Jao,

00:04:46.773 --> 00:04:51.049
whose boundless rage makes his
attacks all the more deadly!

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:54.723
And who could forget our most
interesting competitor?

00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:56.627
Lucy's been shaking up Block C

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.329
ever since he stepped
into the ring!

00:04:58.363 --> 00:05:01.536
And right now, he's hot on
the trail of Jean the Bandit!

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.880
[LUFFY] Hey! Gimme back my
helmet right now, Cactus Head!

00:05:06.913 --> 00:05:08.851
Man, this sucks!

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:13.660
I'll make you pay!
And your grandfather, too!

00:05:13.694 --> 00:05:14.863
Back off!

00:05:14.896 --> 00:05:18.203
[JEAN] Your grandfather Garp?
Well, how 'bout that!

00:05:18.236 --> 00:05:18.971
[COMPETITOR A yelling]

00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:21.375
Get away!

00:05:21.408 --> 00:05:26.854
Now, where is he? Argh.
Come back here, Straw Hat!

00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:28.624
[LUFFY]
I said give it!

00:05:28.658 --> 00:05:32.431
[JEAN laughs]
I don't give back what I take!

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.737
Why do you think
they call me a Bandit?

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.140
[COMPETITORS grunting]

00:05:37.173 --> 00:05:38.677
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.648
Uh-oh! My beard!

00:05:40.682 --> 00:05:42.885
[gasping]

00:05:42.918 --> 00:05:45.725
[JEAN]
Is something wrong, Lucy?

00:05:45.758 --> 00:05:47.194
Uh! Aw, man!

00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:48.163
[JEAN]
Why are you hiding?

00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:49.733
Well, 'cause I, uh...!

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.904
[JEAN]
Cat got your tongue?

00:05:51.937 --> 00:05:53.574
I can only think of one reason

00:05:53.607 --> 00:05:55.878
why you'd want to cover
your face like that.

00:05:55.911 --> 00:05:59.151
Nice to meet you,
Straw Hat Luffy!

00:05:59.184 --> 00:06:03.059
'Sup? I mean, no!
My name's Lucy!

00:06:03.092 --> 00:06:06.031
[JEAN]
Hmph. Charitable Donation!

00:06:11.977 --> 00:06:14.849
[LUFFY]
Huh? Wait! Where did he go?

00:06:14.883 --> 00:06:17.689
Hey! Come back and fight!

00:06:17.722 --> 00:06:22.163
[JEAN laughs] To think I
would run into Straw Hat Luffy

00:06:22.197 --> 00:06:25.905
at a competition
like this. [laughs]

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:28.844
But I've got an advantage.

00:06:28.877 --> 00:06:32.150
This arena's full of weapons
just ripe for the taking.

00:06:32.184 --> 00:06:36.426
It's the perfect opportunity
to put my skills to use.

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:40.400
I'll just pick up as
many as I can carry.

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:43.072
He won't stand a chance.

00:06:43.105 --> 00:06:46.446
I better find that guy quick.

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:47.582
[COMPETITORS yelping]

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:50.219
[GYATS] What? Don't look now,
ladies and gents,

00:06:50.253 --> 00:06:53.059
but the other competitors are
flying all over the place!

00:06:53.093 --> 00:06:55.565
What's causing such
a phenomenon?

00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:58.871
Kelly Funk is punching
them into oblivion!

00:06:58.905 --> 00:07:00.974
Rah-Rah-Rah Rampage!

00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:04.983
So Kelly suddenly grew bigger,
and Bobby's gone missing?

00:07:05.016 --> 00:07:08.824
This match just
keeps getting crazier!

00:07:08.857 --> 00:07:10.761
Now, what's next?

00:07:10.794 --> 00:07:12.397
[COMPETITOR N]
I know what I saw,

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.970
but I can't make
heads or tails of it!

00:07:15.003 --> 00:07:16.105
[KELLY grunting]

00:07:16.138 --> 00:07:17.509
[COMPETITOR N] That looks like
Kelly over there,

00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:21.215
but I think it's Bobby!
How can that be?

00:07:21.248 --> 00:07:25.457
Did Bobby and Kelly become
one and the same somehow?

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.031
Jacket-Jacket. Two-in-a-Coat!

00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:44.796
Huh? Wh-What the hell?

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.702
Hurry and put me on!

00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:48.905
[BOBBY grunts]

00:07:48.938 --> 00:07:50.440
How are they doin' that?

00:07:50.474 --> 00:07:53.246
[COMPETITOR F yells]

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:55.685
[BOBBY] I told you, bro,
I don't want to fight anybody.

00:07:55.718 --> 00:07:56.920
Don't be a wimp!

00:07:56.953 --> 00:07:59.759
Just stop your whining and
zip me up already, would ya?

00:07:59.793 --> 00:08:01.530
We've got work to do here!

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:03.399
[BOBBY gasps]

00:08:03.432 --> 00:08:06.973
[KELLY] Bobby's been strong as
hell since the day he was born,

00:08:07.007 --> 00:08:10.882
but all that muscle's
wasted on a softie like him!

00:08:10.915 --> 00:08:13.419
That's where my power
comes in handy.

00:08:13.453 --> 00:08:17.094
When he wears me as his "skin,"
I can take over his body.

00:08:17.127 --> 00:08:18.997
Then, I bust out
my fighting skills

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:22.905
and use his brute strength in
ways he don't have the guts to!

00:08:27.615 --> 00:08:29.853
[KELLY chuckles]

00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:32.290
[BOO grunting, gasps]

00:08:32.323 --> 00:08:32.992

00:08:33.025 --> 00:08:34.161
[BOO]
Uh!

00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:38.537
Uh... Wh-What are you?

00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:41.543
[KELLY] I'm the guy who ate
the Jacket Jacket Fruit.

00:08:41.577 --> 00:08:44.448
It lets me take control
of any man or any beast

00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:47.287
that puts me on and
wears me like a jacket!

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.793
And since Bobby's wearing me,

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:52.699
we're just like the same person!

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:55.136
We're unbeatable now!

00:08:55.169 --> 00:08:57.007
All that tells me is that
you're not good enough

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.011
to fight on your own!

00:08:59.044 --> 00:09:02.251
[chuckles, gasps]

00:09:02.284 --> 00:09:04.822
[KELLY] There's still time
to take those words back.

00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:09.398
[BOO] What, that you can't
fight on your own? It's true!

00:09:09.432 --> 00:09:10.768
[KELLY]
Not that.

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:12.772
I mean, when you
opened up your pie hole

00:09:12.806 --> 00:09:14.108
and called me a "shrimp"!

00:09:14.141 --> 00:09:15.210
[BOO gasping]

00:09:15.244 --> 00:09:18.182

00:09:34.214 --> 00:09:38.690
How 'bout that? You think
I'm a shrimp now, buddy?

00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:42.464
[COMPETITOR N] H-He really
made quick work of him!

00:09:42.497 --> 00:09:45.036
[KELLY grunting]

00:09:53.987 --> 00:09:57.026
[laughs] That was too easy!

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.029
[SAI]
Hey...

00:09:58.062 --> 00:10:02.271
Huh? Ah, so you must be
the other brother

00:10:02.304 --> 00:10:05.209
from the Kano Kingdom.
Bad news, pal,

00:10:05.243 --> 00:10:08.449
your little bro here
didn't put up much of a fight.

00:10:08.482 --> 00:10:10.487
Bobby and I make a
pretty good living

00:10:10.521 --> 00:10:13.360
working together as assassins.

00:10:13.393 --> 00:10:15.463
But you... What a pity.

00:10:15.497 --> 00:10:18.570
You can't even protect
each other!

00:10:18.603 --> 00:10:21.777
You beat him because
he didn't train enough.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.613
Ooh, that's harsh.

00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:27.421
Especially since you're about
to get your ass handed to you.

00:10:27.454 --> 00:10:29.626
[SAI growls]

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.897

[KELLY grunting]

00:10:35.738 --> 00:10:38.944
Is this supposed to be the great
Kano Kingdom martial art?

00:10:38.978 --> 00:10:40.981
Don't make me laugh!

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.653
Aww, what's the matter?

00:10:43.687 --> 00:10:45.991
Can't talk 'cause you're
sad about your brother?

00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:48.697
No, I gave up any emotional
attachment to my brother

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:52.605
the moment I became a student
of the Eight-Impact Fist!

00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:56.779
[SAI]
That said...

00:11:09.673 --> 00:11:13.413
I will avenge my
fallen subordinate!

[CROWD cheering]

00:11:49.685 --> 00:11:51.422
Hell, yeah! Woo!

00:11:51.455 --> 00:11:54.061
[GYATS] The Eight-Impact Fist
claims its victim!

00:11:54.094 --> 00:11:56.231
I can see why Sai's the chief!

00:11:56.265 --> 00:11:58.303
And just when it looked
like no one would beat

00:11:58.336 --> 00:11:59.906
that monster Kelly Funk!

00:11:59.939 --> 00:12:02.979
[SAI] Until we accomplish our
mission, I won't falter,

00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:06.018
and I won't let anyone
stand in my way.

00:12:06.052 --> 00:12:09.592

Jeez, where did that guy go?

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.704

Hm?

00:12:15.737 --> 00:12:17.440
[IDEO]
Well, I'm convinced.

00:12:17.474 --> 00:12:21.249
You're clearly the strongest
fighter in this block.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.785
Oh, don't give me that.

00:12:22.818 --> 00:12:26.025
What can you possibly gain
from praising your enemy?

00:12:26.058 --> 00:12:28.362
[IDEO] I was hoping
I'd have a chance to face

00:12:28.395 --> 00:12:31.035
an impressive foe like yourself.

00:12:31.068 --> 00:12:33.540
That so?

00:12:33.573 --> 00:12:36.145
Because after I've defeated you,

00:12:36.178 --> 00:12:39.184
then I will have reached
the top of the pile!

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:40.486
Shut your mouth!

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.923
[IDEO grunts]

00:12:45.396 --> 00:12:46.465
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
Surrender!

00:12:46.498 --> 00:12:49.104
Hold on tight, Momo,
we're gonna make it!

00:12:49.137 --> 00:12:51.075
[GIOLLA laughs]

00:12:51.108 --> 00:12:53.980
[GIOLLA] It's more elegant
to give up now, Straw Hats!

00:12:54.013 --> 00:12:57.320
There's nothing artful about
fighting a losing battle!

00:12:57.353 --> 00:13:00.227
I used my Art Art power to
turn your dowdy little ship

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.598
into an explosion
of shapes and colors!

00:13:02.631 --> 00:13:04.535
As beautiful as it
may be to look at,

00:13:04.569 --> 00:13:07.440
you obviously can't use it
to escape from Dressrosa now,

00:13:07.474 --> 00:13:10.013
and you certainly can't
get away without it, either!

00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:13.152
So stop this foolishness
and hand over Momonosuke!

00:13:13.185 --> 00:13:14.354
"Get away"?

00:13:14.388 --> 00:13:15.991
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
Hey, where'd the others go?

00:13:16.024 --> 00:13:18.730
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A] Yeah,
the dead guy and the raccoon!

00:13:21.836 --> 00:13:23.005
What the--?

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:24.643
[CHOPPER]
Over here, jerks!

00:13:24.676 --> 00:13:25.376
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:27.280
[BROOK laughs]

00:13:27.314 --> 00:13:29.485
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A] Where
the heck did you come from?

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:30.654
Goodbye!

00:13:30.687 --> 00:13:32.525
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
Hey, the Wano kid's gone!

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:33.761
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
And the girl, too!

00:13:33.794 --> 00:13:35.496
Goodness me!

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.435
Well, aren't those ugly...

00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:41.241
Look at the sky!
What's up there?

00:13:47.253 --> 00:13:48.690
Why is it cloudy?

00:13:48.723 --> 00:13:51.529
[NAMI]
Thunderbreed Tempo!

00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:55.704
[screams]

00:13:55.737 --> 00:13:58.376
I can't believe you
would stoop this low!

00:13:58.409 --> 00:14:02.184
I've lost my submarine
and my subordinates!

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:03.286
Hate to break it to you,

00:14:03.319 --> 00:14:05.223
but no matter how bad
the situation gets,

00:14:05.256 --> 00:14:07.160
we'd never abandon the Sunny!

00:14:07.193 --> 00:14:08.964
Let's take it back, you two!

00:14:08.998 --> 00:14:09.999
[CHOPPER]
Yeah!

00:14:10.032 --> 00:14:12.371
Oh my, Nami, you sound so cool!

00:14:12.404 --> 00:14:14.575
Well, what are you
waiting for? Go get her!

00:14:14.609 --> 00:14:16.112
[BOTH]
Huh?!

00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:17.748
You're making us fight her?

00:14:17.781 --> 00:14:20.788
But what do you expect me to do
with this limp noodle body?

00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:22.558
It's hopeless!

00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:24.896
Help! Luffy!

00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:28.670
[LUFFY]
Dude, how is this a fair fight?

00:14:38.222 --> 00:14:40.460
[LUFFY] Where'd that big ball
of metal come from?!

00:14:40.493 --> 00:14:41.629
[GYATS]
I don't believe it!

00:14:41.663 --> 00:14:45.236
He's collected weapons from
all over the Colosseum!

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.311
Our infamous bandit certainly
has pilfered quite the arsenal,

00:14:49.344 --> 00:14:53.285
but can he steal victory
from the pockets of Lucy?

00:14:53.318 --> 00:14:56.993
[JEAN] Nowhere to run
and nowhere to hide,

00:14:57.026 --> 00:14:59.865
Straw Hat Luffy.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.177
[LUFFY] Not much I can do
if he's got me figured out.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.448
But I still want my helmet back!

00:15:24.481 --> 00:15:26.653
[JEAN]
Charitable Donation!

[LUFFY grunts]

00:15:31.863 --> 00:15:33.365
[JEAN] You've made me
quite a wealthy man

00:15:33.398 --> 00:15:35.705
over the past two
years, you know!

00:15:35.738 --> 00:15:37.341
[LUFFY]
Huh? I have?

00:15:37.374 --> 00:15:39.210
[JEAN] That's right,
I've made a fortune

00:15:39.244 --> 00:15:44.521
nabbing all the prisoners you
set free from Impel Down!

00:15:44.555 --> 00:15:49.699
And I'm not giving up till
I've got the rest of you, too!

00:15:49.733 --> 00:15:52.571
"The Genius Jester" Buggy!

00:15:52.604 --> 00:15:55.142
"First Son of the Sea" Jimbei!

00:15:55.175 --> 00:15:58.015
Sir Crocodile!

00:15:58.048 --> 00:16:00.654
The Miracle Maker, Ivankov!

00:16:00.688 --> 00:16:03.226
Shiryu of the Rain!

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:06.600
I'll be a hero for
hunting all of you down!

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:09.270
[LUFFY] Oh yeah, I wonder
how those guys are doin'.

00:16:09.304 --> 00:16:10.908
[JEAN]
And it's not just you.

00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:13.814
There are even more
escapees from Level 6.

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:16.753
Ones the public
doesn't even know about.

00:16:16.786 --> 00:16:18.355
[LUFFY]
From Level 6?

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:21.195
[JEAN] Right, and I know
just where to find them!

00:16:21.228 --> 00:16:23.567
[LUFFY] Guess some of the
others made it out, too.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.104
[JEAN]
Damn it! Hold still!

00:16:27.507 --> 00:16:29.110

[JEAN]
Uh, whoops...

00:17:08.355 --> 00:17:09.091

Gimme that.

[GYATS]
He-- He's out of the ring!

00:17:20.045 --> 00:17:26.358
Jean the Bandit has just been
defeated with a single blow!

00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:29.297
Boy, I'd hate to be on the
receiving end of a headbutt

00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:31.936
from the legendary
pirate Don Chin Jao!

00:17:31.969 --> 00:17:33.640

And all the while,
two other tough competitors

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.455
have been locked in
their own deadly battle!

struggle between two

of the fiercest fighters
ever to grace this stage!

00:18:10.847 --> 00:18:12.952
They've mowed down

all in preparation
for this struggle!

00:18:16.424 --> 00:18:18.864
This is the true test
of their skill!

[GYATS]
Everyone in the colosseum's

00:18:33.059 --> 00:18:36.700
got their eyes glued
to this one fight!

00:18:36.733 --> 00:18:39.972
Whoa, I guess this is
a pretty big deal.

00:18:40.006 --> 00:18:42.010

There's nowhere left to run!

00:18:42.043 --> 00:18:43.411
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:18:43.445 --> 00:18:46.018
[CHIN JAO] You will answer for
what your grandfather did,

00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:47.955
Straw Hat Luffy.

00:18:47.989 --> 00:18:50.728
I'll make certain of that!

00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:52.497
Thanks to that bastard,

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.401
I lost my entire fortune

00:18:54.434 --> 00:18:56.305
and everything that
I once I held dear!

00:18:56.338 --> 00:18:59.646
My power, even my most
precious memories

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:02.083
from the years of my youth!

00:19:02.117 --> 00:19:05.456
I told you to take it up
with my grandpa, not me!

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.728
Death is much too
lenient a punishment

00:19:07.761 --> 00:19:10.701
for all the suffering Garp
has made me endure!

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:13.305
I'll show him what it means
to live with loss.

00:19:13.339 --> 00:19:18.215
That's a fate worse than death!
Now, surrender!

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.558
Why couldn't I have been
assigned to Block C?

00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:23.993
I should be down there!

00:19:24.027 --> 00:19:27.199

Straw Hat Luffy!

and to do that, I have
to get through this guy.

00:20:34.167 --> 00:20:38.108
The Flame Flame Fruit

00:20:38.141 --> 00:20:42.049

are drawing ever closer to
uncovering the profound darkness

00:23:26.712 --> 00:23:29.952
that hides behind Dressrosa's
cheerful exterior.

00:23:29.986 --> 00:23:31.956
