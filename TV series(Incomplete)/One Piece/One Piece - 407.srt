1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,531
[NARRATOR] Last time,
Boss Luffy and company

38
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,241
entered a
once-in-a-lifetime event,

39
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,201
"The Great Portable
Shrine Race."

40
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,704
The grand prize
is a sacred treasure

41
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:47,292
passed down through many
generations in Grand Jipang.

42
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,766
While preparing
for the big event,

43
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,851
they met Brook,

44
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,770
a friendly skeleton who
suffered from memory loss.

45
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,273
Spirits were high
among all the racers,

46
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,567
until their portable
shrines were destroyed

47
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,819
by Hogback of
the Thriller Company,

48
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,448
a group bent on claiming
the prize for themselves.

49
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:22,952
It's over!

50
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,413
There's no way we can
enter the big race now.

51
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,250
And it was such
a beautiful shrine, too.

52
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,793
If their plan
was to wipe out

53
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,670
all the portable shrines
before the race,

54
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,506
that means ours
is in danger, too!

55
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,428
[BROOK] I remember
what happened.

56
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,263
You got your memory back?

57
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:47,727
Yes. I remember
everything now.

58
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,941
Hey, what's with the
hat and that get-up?

59
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,275
'Cause it looks
like you're leaving.

60
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,902
I shouldn't be here with you,

61
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,278
from what I remember.

62
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:00,698
And I am ashamed to say this...

63
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,533
I believe that
I'm actually a member

64
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,452
of the Thriller Company.

65
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,704
[NARRATOR] And so, with his
memory suddenly returned,

66
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:11,376
Brook disappeared into
the dark of night all alone.

67
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,510
[LUFFY]
Feudal Era Side Story!

68
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:24,555
Defeat Thriller Company's Trap!

69
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,023
[ZOMBIE PANDA] That was a pretty
good rampage tonight, guys!

70
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,817
[ZOMBIE HIPPO]
Agreed. And I think Perona-sama

71
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,402
should be quite pleased.

72
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,320
Huh?

73
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,032
Who are you?

74
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:50,415
Every one of you has strayed
from the path of humanity.

75
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,792
Not that you were
human to begin with.

76
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,836
And now, in the
name of Heaven...

77
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,714
I shall punish you!

78
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,842
[ALL groan]

79
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:09,851
[barking]

80
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:13,896
[FRANKY groaning]

81
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,523
[CHOPPER]
There. That should do it!

82
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,483
[FRANKY]
Thanks, buddy.

83
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,361
I couldn't stop 'em from
destroying the portable shrine.

84
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,030
The race is tomorrow, too!

85
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,073
I'm a failure as a carpenter!

86
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,491
[MAO]
You gave it your best,

87
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,784
you didn't do a thing wrong.

88
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,494
Hogback and his
Thriller Company

89
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,371
cronies are to blame for this.

90
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,001
And then there's Brook.

91
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,423
Yeah, I'm worried.

92
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,050
Any idea where he went?

93
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:49,015
[ROBIN] Would you
like me to tell you?

94
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,392
Who are you?

95
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,687
Just a city girl who
happened to be passing by.

96
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,938
She's beautiful!

97
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,857
You would think so, huh?

98
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,569
[ROBIN]
Though the skeleton was indeed

99
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,112
once a member of
the Thriller Company,

100
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,448
he grew sick of
its despicable ways

101
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,033
and eventually
left the organization.

102
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,910
As far as "where he went",

103
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,870
I'm sure he feels
partially responsible

104
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,663
for the shrines that
were destroyed today,

105
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,500
and is likely
keeping to himself.

106
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,087
[BROOK]
Boss Luffy...

107
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,631
Members of the Pinwheel Eatery,

108
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:26,052
I will make amends for how
I have lived and who with.

109
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,764
[NAMI]
Wait, Boss! Hold on!

110
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,350
He never thinks
these things through!

111
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,395
Brook! I'm here!

112
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,522
Where are you?

113
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,650
[HOGBACK laughs]

114
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,568
Ridiculous fool!

115
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,737
It hurts!

116
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,491
[BROOK screams]

117
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,700
[ZORO]
Shut up!

118
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,578
I never thought you'd still
be alive after all of that.

119
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,124
The stabbings and arrow wounds
and sending you down the river,

120
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,751
for your ugly
little betrayal I mean.

121
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,796
[ABSALOM] Why risk what little
life you have by coming back?

122
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,800
There's no point
trying to explain it.

123
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,927
People like you
would never understand.

124
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,846
Alright, then add
another weight!

125
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,682
[ZOMBIES]
Adding another weight.

126
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,977
[BROOK yells]

127
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,145
Show some dignity!

128
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:21,023
That's enough!
Finish him off.

129
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,984
Wait! Hold on,
time out!

130
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,695
I-I'm not ready
to die just yet!

131
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,739
Although, I have already
been dead a long time.

132
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,575
[BROOK laughs]

133
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,618
Ah! I don't want this!

134
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,668
Would you just
shut up, please?

135
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,044
Brook!

136
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,506
Boss Luffy!

137
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,759
What's the big idea,
walking off like that?

138
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,970
Come on, let's get you back.

139
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,680
[HOGBACK]
Not so fast!

140
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,849
You're that fellow
we ran into earlier.

141
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,893
The policeman!

142
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,649
Get outta my way.

143
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,193
You guys really piss me off,

144
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,528
but I don't have any
business with you right now.

145
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,321
Ha!

146
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,530
Even if you are
a public official,

147
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,492
there's no way we're letting
you leave here in one piece!

148
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,993
Get him, boys!

149
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,206
You're disturbing the
neighbors, and my sleep!

150
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:24,504
Three-Sword Style. Tatsu-Maki!

151
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,883
All right Gum-Gum
Billy Club!

152
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,053
Go! Move it!

153
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,846
After him!

154
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,226
[ZORO]
These weirdos just keep coming!

155
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:47,735
[coughing]

156
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,238
[HOGBACK]
Wait-- Where'd they--

157
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,657
They're gone!

158
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,991
[ABSALOM]
They couldn't have gotten far!

159
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,327
Find them! Hurry!

160
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,835
[LUFFY]
Hey, we're back!

161
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,005
My word!

162
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,846
Luffy! And Brook! Welcome back!

163
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,139
I'm so glad you made it!

164
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,724
You must be hungry!

165
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,935
We've got special
Stamina Rice Balls!

166
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,646
[LUFFY laughs]
Yum!

167
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,191
I don't understand.
What are all of you doing?

168
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,652
We're fixing our portable
shrine, of course.

169
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,987
Surely not.

170
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,822
[BROOK]
The race is tomorrow!

171
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,699
You'll never finish in time!

172
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,993
Don't count us out yet.

173
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:41,038
But why? Why would you all
go to such great lengths?

174
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,832
[ALL]
Our pride.

175
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,419
Giving up, turning tail, and
running away isn't our style.

176
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,421
This isn't over
by a long shot.

177
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,716
[LOLA]
That's right. Us, too.

178
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,426
We all feel the
exact same way.

179
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,386
Whoa, it's the
Rolling Express!

180

00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,850
and this race
and you ruined it!

359
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,936
So now, you're gonna pay!

360
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,688
But I don't wanna!

361
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,984
[ALL screaming]

362
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:22,990
And that makes the
winner Pinwheel Eatery!

363
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,330
Congratulations.
Now, about the prize.

364
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,041
I know! It's one
million Ryo-Berries!

365
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,669
Sorry, but I'm going
to have to keep this.

366
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,337
[NAMI]
Huh?

367
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,716
[IGRAM] Your racing left this
town in a state of disaster.

368
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,843
No fair.

369
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,553
Never fear.

370
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,013
Just as was promised,

371
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,640
the sacred treasure
in the temple is yours.

372
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,725
All right!

373
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,560
Way to go, guys.

374
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,812
[CHOPPER] I wonder what the
sacred treasure is like!

375
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,439
[IGRAM]
It's been 100 years

376
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,857
since the shrine
was last opened,

377
00:21:56,898 --> 00:22:00,569
so this will be my first
time seeing it, as well!

378
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,699
[IGRAM] This is the
magical sacred treasure

379
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,701
passed down
in Grand Jipang,

380
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:12,456
generation after
generation for this day!

381
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,388
"Instructions for
the Maiden Panties.

382
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,349
Make a wish with
these panties on,

383
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,601
and that wish will
be granted forthwith.

384
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,520
Again, you must
be wearing them.

385
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,357
Wait. Limited to
beautiful women only?"

386
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,359
They're just perfect!

387
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,527
Omao-san, would
you mind putting

388
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,821
on those wish-making
panties for me?

389
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,448
[MAO shrieks]

390
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,788
Wait, who am I?
What's going on here?

391
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,956
[CHOPPER] It looks like Brook's
lost his memory again!

392
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,042
[MAO]
Brook-san! I'm so sorry!

393
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:02,339
[LUFFY laughing]

394
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,937
[NARRATOR] Hurled far from
Sabaody by Kuma's strange power,

395
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,022
Luffy finds himself
on an unfamiliar island.

396
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,692
After an unfortunate run-in
with some poisonous mushrooms,

397
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,944
he falls unconscious.

398
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:27,030
Gravely ill, he is approached
by a team of female warriors,

399
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,533
who could be friend or foe.

400
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,784
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece.

401
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:34,413
"Landing! The All-Female
Island, Amazon Lily!."

402
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,623
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
