00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,959
I'd recognize that
little traitor

174
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,795
to our company anywhere!

175
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,030
They noticed!

176
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:51,998
They did?!

177
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,967
We're still in the air.
This is really bad!

178
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,271
If they shoot at us,
we're finished!

179
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,939
[CROCODILE]
Whatever it is you really want

180
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,008
can't be in this country.

181
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,778
Aren't I right? You're fighting
for somebody else's goal now.

182
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,114
And how can there be any
point in dying for that?

183
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,349
If only you would just get
rid of a friend or two,

184
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,020
you could easily avoid so many
of these inconvenient problems.

185
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,390
Loyalty is only for
idiots and weaklings.

186
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,025
[LUFFY]
Like I said,

187
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:23,396
you really don't understand
anything, do you?

188
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,064
Vivi...

189
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:30,636
[LUFFY] Vivi is always telling
people not to risk their lives,

190
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,405
but she's the first
to lay down her life

191
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,307
in order to save others.

192
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,144
If we don't help her,
she'll die. You'll kill her.

193
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,713
[CROCODILE]
You still don't get it.

194
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,315
That's what makes
her such a burden.

195
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,318
So why not ditch the princess
and save yourselves?

196
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,054
Because none of us
want Vivi to die!

197
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,990
Helping each other
is what friends do!

198
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,992
And that's why none of
us will leave her behind

199
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,727
or quit fighting you!

200
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,998
As long as she doesn't give up
on her country, neither will we!

201
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,402
Even if that means all the
rest of you end up dead?

202
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,039
If we die, we die.
That's all there is to it.

203
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,241
Adjust Ribbit‐Ribbit
Gun for attack!

204
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,177
This is an unexpected catch.

205
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,279
Adjusting Yellow Gun!

206
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,113
[laughs]

207
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,015
How nice. How nice.
This is good!

208
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,017
They are the perfect
prey for us!

209
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,852
What do you think
you bastards are doing,

210
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,954
pointing your guns at Vivi?!

211
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,023
This isn't good! The two
of them are a sniper team!

212
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,024
[ZORO]
Chopper!

213
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,425
I'll throw you guys up, anyway.

214
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,760
It'll change the direction,

215
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,228
but you need to
figure somethin' out!

216
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,863
[CHOPPER]
Huh? What do I do?

217
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,398
We have seven seconds!

218
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,301
Just figure something out!

219
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:40,706
[ZORO] Chopper, Vivi! Are you
ready? I'm sendin' you up.

220
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,209
Ready?

221
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,944
Aim and fire!

222
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:50,216
Our bullets are set to
crash into each other!

223
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,118
And then they're
going to explode!

224
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,986
[laughs]

225
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,388
[ZORO groans]

226
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,723
No!

227
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,295
What an idiot!

228
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,897
He's hit!

229
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,433
[CHOPPER]
Are you ready, Vivi?

230
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,236
[VIVI] Just throw me with
all your strength, Tony!

231
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,775
It's no use, ribbit, ribbit.

232
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:16,509
Dodging.

233
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,511
[BOTH]
Aim and fire!

234
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,946
Who's that?

235
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,248
Huh?

236
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,788
[CHOPPER screams]

237
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,456
Where'd Miss Wednesday go?

238
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,958
Oh! What now?

239
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,330
[VIVI]
Peacock String!

240
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,999
[MR. 7]
Up there!

241
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,838
[BOTH]
Go!

242
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,040
[BOTH yell]

243
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:07,860
[CROCODILE laughing]

244
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,261
You can talk as
tough as you want

245
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,430
and keep blathering on about
friendship if you like,

246
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,934
but your body is still
freezing up on you.

247
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,070
You look pathetic, Straw Hat.

248
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,008
[yelling]

249
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,910
[VIVI]
Slasher!

250
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,715
Ribbit. Well, Princess.

251
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,784
Looks like you missed us!

252
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,057
[VIVI]
Run Back!

253
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,763
[USOPP]
All right!

254
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,387
[CHILDREN]
Vivi!

255
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,123
[GATEKEEPER]
Hey! Out of here, you brats!

256
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,225
Did you sneak in through
the shortcut again?

257
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,260
Gatekeeper!

258
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,928
[CHILD C]
Run!

259
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,130
[GATEKEEPER] Would the two
of you please say something

260
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,499
to the kids to keep them away?

261
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,967
[PELL]
Hm?

262
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,969
Sure.

263
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,338
Vivi. Going somewhere?

264
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,073
[VIVI]
Mh‐hm. The secret base.

265
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:31,010
Right. Well, you
have a good time.

266
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,015
[CHAKA]
So, where did Princess Vivi go?

267
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,082
[PELL]
Huh?

268
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,952
Oh, I can't tell you.
It's a secret.

269
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,086
[CHAKA chuckles]

270
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,322
[CHAKA]
The clock tower, huh?

271
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,222
It stopped, right?

272
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:39,144
[ticking]

273
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,925
[ZORO coughs]

274
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,561
Oh, hey, you're still alive.

275
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:59,064
Yeah. What happened
with the cannon?

276
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,268
[MARINE B]
What was that?

277
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,010
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

278
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,113
What's the matter?

279
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,181
Apparently, somethin's
gone wrong up there.

280
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,051
It's Vivi. We still
haven't seen her.

281
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,188
Oh, no. You guys!

282
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,390
[NAMI]
What is it?

283
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,091
The cannon ball has
a timing device.

284
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,861
If we don't do something,
it'll explode!

285
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:32,564
[USOPP]
Ah! What did you say?!

286
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:38,203
A time bomb? No.

287
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,972
[CROCODILE chuckles]

288
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,907
[CROCODILE]
I was very well prepared, Cobra.

289
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,244
You have to be willing to
admit that much, surely.

290
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,379
The most successful
missions always account

291
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,883
for unforeseen circumstances.

292
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,284
In this case, for instance,

293
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,920
even if something happens
to the cannoneers,

294
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,556
the cannon ball will
still explode on its own.

295
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:02,094
The attack will only be delayed
by a few seconds or so.

296
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,562
Of course, I did
originally want it

297
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,265
to be shot into the
center of the Square,

298
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,434
but the cannon ball is big
enough that it should do

299
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:12,171
plenty of damage
from right where it is.

300
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:15,274
[CROCODILE chuckles]

301
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,944
[CROCODILE]
Stopping the rebellion.

302
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,612
Saving the kingdom.

303
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:25,684
All those worthless ideas
you've clung to for so long.

304
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:30,122
In the end, they just created
more victims for me.

305
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,363
[CROCODILE]
Let me tell you something.

306
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:46,005
[CROCODILE] You're never
going to save this country.

307
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,342
Damn it. This isn't right!

308
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,512
Stopping the cannoneers
should've stopped the attack!

309
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,381
A timer?

310
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,650
Considering its power, even
if it explodes from up there,

311
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,987
it'll still kill all the people
in the Square and the town.

312
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,655
[gasps]

313
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,157
Then what's gonna happen now?!

314
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,158
Oh, crap!

315
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,726
Does this just mean it
was impossible all along

316
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,963
for us to stop the explosion
from happening?

317
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,169
[VIVI] He made us spend all
this time looking for it!

318
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,572
He even announced the attack
so we would do just that!

319
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,974
Why?

320
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:25,044
[VIVI crying]

321
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,646
Just how far will Crocodile
insist on going

322
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,983
to make fools of us all?

323
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,352
It's not enough for him to
tear this country apart,

324
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,321
he has to mock us
while he's doing it!

325
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:42,828
[VIVI]
Crocodile!

326
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,873
Wait, was that‐‐?

327
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,309
Yeah, I think it's the bird man.

328
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,815
[VIVI]
Pell?

329
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,651
Wow, this place brings
back so many memories.

330
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:09,555
The Sand‐Sand Clan's
super‐secret base.

331
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,789
Pell, listen to me...

332
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,991
You certainly were a mischievous
little child, Princess Vivi.

333
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,493
You gave us no end of trouble

334
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:18,297
with all your pranks
and disappearances.

335
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,298
[ROYAL SOLDIER A]
It's Vivi!

336
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:23,368
What's she doing in
the ammunition bunker?

337
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,738
Hey! What happened?
What was that explosion?

338
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,341
[coughing]

339
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,343
Princess Vivi, how many
times have we told you

340
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,811
not to go near the
ammunition bunker?

341
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,813
You could get hurt!

342
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,381
[VIVI]
Pell!

343
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,716
[ROYAL SOLDIER B]
Sir!

344
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,987
I was trying to make some
fireworks, but I messed up.

345
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,655
I know it's the
anniversary of the day

346
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,991
you joined the army, Pell, so‐‐
