00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.020
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.090
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.860
Smiling, even as he stood
upon the scaffold,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.030
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.330
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.330
You can have it!

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.270
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.470
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.310
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.980
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.570
[NARRATOR] After a deadly
struggle on Fishman Island,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.580
the Straw Hats have finally
arrived in the New World,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.580
where they immediately
come to face with

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.850
the treacherous
weather conditions of

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.850
the Maubeugemour Sea.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.050
There, they met
a young Giant girl

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.050
who ate the Mini-Mini Fruit.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.520
Oh!
My name's Lily Enstomach.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.730
But some people call me
"Lily the Glutton."

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.890
Guess 'cause I eat
a lot for a girl!

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.860
The ship that's carrying Dad--

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.930
it's gonna pass
right through this area!

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.600
What? That's terrible news!

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.740
I don't want to cross
paths with the Navy!

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.700
Yeah, I'm with Brook!

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.940
If the Navy comes here,
it's not gonna be pretty!

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.540
True, but I have to save Dad!

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.780
And I'll do whatever it takes!

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.280
If they take him to Impel Down,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.480
I'll probably never
see him again!

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.720
Catching that Navy ship
is my only chance!

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.390
[LUFFY] Lily.
I wanna help save your dad!

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.220
[LILY]
Huh?

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.120
If he's the only one
who can cook like that,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.260
then we have to get him out
so I can try it, right?

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.330
[NARRATOR] And so, the
Straw Hat Pirates agreed

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.930
to help Lily rescue
her father, Panz Fry,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.070
from the clutches of the Navy.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.500
However, a mysterious
group called the Neo Navy

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.970
hopes to catch the
giant and kill him.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.010
[SHUZO] I have received
word that a ship carrying

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.450
that arrogant pirate Panz Fry

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.250
will be passing through
the area soon.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.920
[LUFFY]
It's the Navy!

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.660
--There's my dad!
--He's so big.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.530
[LUFFY]
"Z's Ambition!

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.330
A Dark and Powerful Army!"

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.790
They're only
transporting one dude,

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.330
but they had to send
four ships to do it?

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.630
Damn, looks like they're
pulling out all the stops.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.800
Your dad must be a big shot.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.470
Oh, no.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.840
[ROBIN]
Is that all there is to it?

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.310
Sending four ships
is strange in itself.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.240
But more than that,
why would they choose to travel

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.180
through these dangerous waters
just to get to Impel Down?

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.210
I wonder.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.720
Meh. Attack first and
ask questions never!

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.550
[grunts]

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.990
What are you talking
about, Luffy?

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.420
You know that won't work!

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.360
Look.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.860
The whole point of this
mission is saving Lily's father,

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.660
not just beating up on the Navy!

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.530
We have to be
extra careful here.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.670
If we just barge in
without a decent plan,

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.770
he could get hurt!

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.030
Nami's right, Luffy!

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.100
Besides, if something
happens to Panz Fry,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.940
you'll never get any
of that volcano cooking

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.440
you wanted to try!

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.780
All right.
So what do you wanna do then?

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.780
Well, it's gonna take finesse.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.550
Let the thief handle this one.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.450
'Kay?

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.550
Okay! Whatever you say!

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.450
Thank you!

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.120
Good. Here we go!

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.630
First off, we need
a diversion team.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.130
You guys go out
on the Mini-Merry

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.230
and draw their attention
from a distance,

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.770
creating an opportunity
for the infiltration team.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.870
That team will be
made up of Brook, Robin,

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.240
and Luffy, with Chopper
as the boat operator.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.710
Diversion team, huh?

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.380
So I get to go right in
and start kicking butt!

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.310
No way!

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.540
I call it the diversion team
because Robin and Brook

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.210
will be distracting them.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.420
All I want you to do
is lay low and wait inside

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.050
the Mini-Merry just in case
something goes haywire.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.590
Outside of that,
you can't do anything!

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.160
Now, the infiltration team:
You guys take the Shark Submerge

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.090
and sneak your way
onto the raft without letting

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.330
any Navy soldiers see you.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.830
That way, you can cut the chain
and set Lily's father free.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.570
That team is Zoro, Sanji--

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.440
Anything for you!

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.980
Usopp, and Lily. Sound good?

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.010
Okay!

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.350
That sounds way more fun
than what I get to do.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.580
[NAMI] Now, the tricky
part is gonna be getting

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.620
Panz Fry over here
safely and discreetly.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.420
Yeah, it's hard not
to notice a guy that big.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.160
[NAMI] And it'd be nice
if we could steal one

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.690
of their ships, but that's
kind of a big undertaking.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.760
So, instead, I say we detach
the raft from the ship

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.200
and whisk it away
using a Coup de Burst.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.470
Franky, you stay here
on the Sunny and wait

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.200
where they can't see you.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.370
Make sure the Coup de Burst
is ready to go.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.310
I gotcha!

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.280
That's us. And you?

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.440
Oh, me?

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.950
I'll act as the command post
and watch their movement

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.310
from the White Hobby Horse.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.620
One more thing to keep in mind.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.120
Maubeugemour Sea
is unpredictable.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.520
So watch out for severe weather.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.220
Okay, let's do this!

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.220
[GROUP]
Right!

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.830
[ROBIN] I just noticed,
everyone on this team

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.830
has Devil Fruit powers.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.670
Ah! Indeed we do!

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.840
If we fall out,
it's all over for us.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.070
This is worrisome.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.080
I sure hope we don't drown
or get torn apart by sharks.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.480
[BROOK, CHOPPER yell]

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.750
I'm freaked out now!

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.020
[NAMI laughs] That's right, all
of you except Lily are out here.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.420
I did that on purpose.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.550
I figured you guys would
be a lot safer this way

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.090
than if you were part
of the infiltration team!

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.190
See you later!

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.430
Hey, hold on.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.270
I thought I told Luffy
to go with you too.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.670
Oh, he already left
on the Shark Submerge.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.770
No surprise.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:08.770
Huh?

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.940
[USOPP] Yeah, he said the
diversion team sounded boring,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.010
so he came with us instead.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:17.910
Huh?!

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.550
[LUFFY chuckling]
Man.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.120
Can't wait to meet your
dad and try that food!

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.390
Yeah!

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.620
[NAMI]
Ugh, I should've known.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.060
All right, fine, Luffy!

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.060
Listen up!

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.630
Whatever you do,
don't sneak onto the raft!

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.800
It'll screw up the whole plan,
do you understand me?

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.270
[LUFFY]
Okay!

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.240
[USOPP] Hey, Lily, you and
your dad came from Elbaf

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.040
like the other giants, right?

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.710
Huh? Wow, Usopp!

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.740
You mean you've heard
of Elbaf before?

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.150
Have I! You bet!

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.550
You know Dorry and Broggy,
the pirate bosses?

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.620
Well, we're good buddies
with those two!

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.790
[LILY]
Really?

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.820
But they're legendary heroes!

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.760
You've actually met them?

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.960
Yup! Sure have!

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.060
Whoa!

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.660
You guys are something else!

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.630
Even I've never seen them!

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.330
But my dad's been
friends with both of them

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:08.900
ever since they were kids!

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.070
[USOPP]
Really?

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.630
[LILY] Yeah.
He used to tell me stories

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.400
about them all the time.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.170
[ROBIN chuckles]
That's nice.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.640
They're all having fun.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.240
[BROOK] Why don't we have
some fun over here too?

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:19.910
[CHOPPER]
Yeah!

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:20.980
[guitar music]

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.080
[BROOK] I call it,
"Let's Go to the Rescue!"

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.480
Б≥╙ [BROOK (SONG)]
Go, go, let's go! Б≥╙

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.950
Б≥╙ Ain't afraid of
stormy weather! Oh-- Б≥╙

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.950
Quiet down! Now!

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.690
Brook, you got us in trouble!

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.455
[BROOK]
No fun for us.

00:09:43.396 --> 00:09:44.866
[PANZ]
Step aside!

00:09:45.906 --> 00:09:48.206
[MARINES yell]

00:09:55.876 --> 00:09:57.886
[PANZ]
Get out of my way!

00:09:57.886 --> 00:09:59.146
[MARINES yell]

00:10:00.146 --> 00:10:01.156
[PANZ]
Huh?

00:10:02.516 --> 00:10:03.856
[PANZ yells]

00:10:06.256 --> 00:10:08.226
Of all the pirates
I've captured,

00:10:08.226 --> 00:10:09.926
you were the first
to board a Government

00:10:09.926 --> 00:10:12.566
cargo ship so brazenly.

00:10:12.566 --> 00:10:14.896
What were you attempting to do?

00:10:14.896 --> 00:10:17.766
[PANZ] The only thing I wanted
was to take back

00:10:17.766 --> 00:10:21.076
what you stole from them!

00:10:21.076 --> 00:10:23.706
The New World has
been drowned in chaos

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:27.616
ever since you Navy soldiers
murdered Whitebeard!

00:10:27.616 --> 00:10:29.676
That island where
the Government's ship

00:10:29.676 --> 00:10:32.386
was moored is no exception.

00:10:32.386 --> 00:10:34.956
And the people living there
were dangerously close

00:10:34.956 --> 00:10:36.886
to starvation.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.626
But the selfish crew of
that ship took all the food

00:10:39.626 --> 00:10:42.296
the islanders had stored away!

00:10:42.296 --> 00:10:45.296
Just to add to the lavish
feasts the World Nobles

00:10:45.296 --> 00:10:47.566
enjoyed every night!

00:10:47.566 --> 00:10:49.366
I am a cook!

00:10:49.366 --> 00:10:53.366
My life's purpose is to provide
food for the hungry!

00:10:53.366 --> 00:10:54.536
So you believe it's
all right for you

00:10:54.536 --> 00:10:56.536
to steal food from
the Government.

00:10:56.536 --> 00:10:58.446
The main reason the
New World is in disarray

00:10:58.446 --> 00:11:00.246
is pirates like yourself.

00:11:00.246 --> 00:11:02.216
You are misplacing
the blame here.

00:11:09.286 --> 00:11:13.486
[PANZ] It appears we remain
as divided on the issue as ever.

00:11:13.486 --> 00:11:16.926
We will never reach
an agreement.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:18.066
So it seems.

00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:22.596
Attention, men.
Be on high alert!

00:11:22.596 --> 00:11:25.436
Someone is raiding
pirates in this area.

00:11:25.436 --> 00:11:27.236
And since we're
carrying a pirate,

00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:29.276
it's possible we
could be targeted.

00:11:29.276 --> 00:11:30.646
Keep an eye out.

00:11:30.646 --> 00:11:34.146
And if you catch anything
moving, be ready to attack!

00:11:34.146 --> 00:11:35.176
[MARINES]
Sir!

00:11:36.816 --> 00:11:38.816
Here it goes. You ready?

00:11:38.816 --> 00:11:40.016
[ROBIN]
Whenever you are.

00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:46.956
[USOPP]
We're in position.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:47.956
Just say the word!

00:11:50.456 --> 00:11:52.296
Thank you, really!

00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:53.826
Without you guys' help,

00:11:53.826 --> 00:11:55.996
I could never get
my dad back safe.

00:11:55.996 --> 00:11:57.266
I'm so happy!

00:11:57.266 --> 00:11:58.706
Well, don't thank us yet.

00:11:58.706 --> 00:12:01.876
There's still a chance
somebody could screw this up.

00:12:01.876 --> 00:12:03.036
Yeah, you!

00:12:05.446 --> 00:12:07.106
[NAMI]
Time to move!

00:12:07.106 --> 00:12:08.176
Roger.

00:12:08.176 --> 00:12:09.846
Now, Cien Fleurs!

00:12:09.846 --> 00:12:11.686
All right, it's showtime!

00:12:13.986 --> 00:12:15.156
And Clutch!

00:12:15.156 --> 00:12:17.386
[MARINES yell]

00:12:21.026 --> 00:12:22.196
[MARINE C]
What's going on?

00:12:22.196 --> 00:12:24.566
[MARINE F]
Oh, crap, it's a ghost!

00:12:25.366 --> 00:12:28.366
[BROOK]
Yo ho ho ho ho ho ho!

00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:32.366
Actually, I'm a soul!

00:12:32.366 --> 00:12:34.176
Soul sounds much nicer!

00:12:34.176 --> 00:12:36.036
[MARINES yelling]

00:12:37.646 --> 00:12:39.806
[BROOK]
Yo ho ho ho ho ho ho!

00:12:39.806 --> 00:12:40.876
What's all this?

00:12:40.876 --> 00:12:42.676
Good! Let's infiltrate!

00:12:42.676 --> 00:12:44.316
Yeah, you got it! Go!

00:13:16.246 --> 00:13:18.786
[BROOK]
Yo ho ho ho ho ho ho!

00:13:18.786 --> 00:13:20.046
Oh! Nice work, Sanji!

00:13:20.046 --> 00:13:23.356
Perfect!
Phase one's done, and now--

00:13:26.956 --> 00:13:28.096
Luffy!

00:13:32.196 --> 00:13:34.366
[LUFFY chuckles]
Is that him?

00:13:34.366 --> 00:13:36.266
Dude! Lose the mask!

00:13:36.266 --> 00:13:37.196
It can't be!

00:13:37.196 --> 00:13:38.636
Whoa, that's Straw Hat Luffy!

00:13:45.246 --> 00:13:47.246
Hey! It's nice to meet ya!

00:13:49.716 --> 00:13:51.886
Dad. I made it.

00:13:51.886 --> 00:13:52.886
Lily?

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:55.616
Heads up, Luffy.

00:13:55.616 --> 00:13:58.586
We got all the chains
off the big guy.

00:13:58.586 --> 00:14:00.456
[MARINE A]
"Pirate Hunter" Zoro!

00:14:00.456 --> 00:14:02.056
[MARINE F]
Wow, he's a big name!

00:14:02.056 --> 00:14:03.156
And that's...

00:14:04.726 --> 00:14:05.596
Uh...

00:14:05.596 --> 00:14:06.766
[SANJI]
It's Sanji, dammit!

00:14:06.766 --> 00:14:09.096
I'm one of the Straw Hats
too, you know!

00:14:09.096 --> 00:14:10.166
[MARINES]
What?!

00:14:15.136 --> 00:14:16.436
[MARINE A]
Where'd they come from?

00:14:16.436 --> 00:14:18.606
How'd they get on the ship?

00:14:18.606 --> 00:14:21.476
Ugh... Great.

00:14:21.476 --> 00:14:22.846
Well. No biggie.

00:14:22.846 --> 00:14:25.116
I already assumed that something
like this would happen,

00:14:25.116 --> 00:14:28.156
since Luffy went out
with the wrong team.

00:14:28.156 --> 00:14:30.456
Franky! Get over here, hurry!

00:14:30.456 --> 00:14:32.286
We changed the plan!

00:14:32.286 --> 00:14:33.586
Forget the raft!

00:14:33.586 --> 00:14:36.756
We'll just throw a rope around
Panz Fry and run for it!

00:14:36.756 --> 00:14:37.796
[FRANKY]
Roger!

00:14:40.496 --> 00:14:42.296
Lily, go!

00:14:42.296 --> 00:14:43.366
Okay.

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:45.606
[MOMONGA]
Straw Hat!

00:14:47.106 --> 00:14:48.176
You won't get away!

00:14:48.176 --> 00:14:49.806
[LUFFY grunts]
Nice try!

00:14:51.706 --> 00:14:53.646
[ZORO]
A swordsman, huh?

00:14:53.646 --> 00:14:55.646
Uh-huh.
He's a Vice Admiral.

00:14:55.646 --> 00:14:57.346
Ha! Big deal.

00:14:59.646 --> 00:15:01.556
They just have to
do it the hard way.

00:15:04.626 --> 00:15:06.226
I found you!

00:15:06.226 --> 00:15:08.556
Lily! You're okay!

00:15:08.556 --> 00:15:11.966
[LILY] Yep!
Oh, Dad, I missed you so much!

00:15:14.496 --> 00:15:16.666
[PANZ chuckling]

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.566
[LILY laughing]

00:15:23.376 --> 00:15:25.376
[PANZ gasps]

00:15:25.376 --> 00:15:28.408
[LILY gasps]

00:15:43.788 --> 00:15:45.458
[PANZ grunts]

00:15:47.058 --> 00:15:48.298
Dad, no!

00:15:50.198 --> 00:15:52.428
You're kidding me!
What's going on here?

00:15:53.468 --> 00:15:54.568
[LUFFY]
Are you okay?

00:15:56.768 --> 00:15:57.938
[MARINES yell]

00:15:57.938 --> 00:15:59.578
--[MOMONGA] What?!
--[MARINES grunt]

00:16:00.878 --> 00:16:03.148
[MOMONGA]
Assess the damage, quickly!

00:16:03.148 --> 00:16:04.908
[SHUZO laughing]

00:16:04.908 --> 00:16:07.718
Just consider this our
way of saying hello.

00:16:07.718 --> 00:16:09.548
Bring us up! Quickly!

00:16:09.548 --> 00:16:10.788
Let's finish them.

00:16:10.788 --> 00:16:11.718
[NEO MARINES]
Sir!

00:16:11.718 --> 00:16:13.088
[MARINE C]
It broke through the hull!

00:16:13.088 --> 00:16:14.418
Water's coming in fast!

00:16:14.418 --> 00:16:15.958
But who's shooting at us?

00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.628
[MARINE B]
We can't see anybody!

00:16:17.628 --> 00:16:20.458
[MARINE K] Then just estimate
their location by the path

00:16:20.458 --> 00:16:22.798
of the torpedoes
and fire that way!

00:16:22.798 --> 00:16:23.798
[MARINE B]
Right!

00:16:28.998 --> 00:16:30.908
[SHUZO]
Now, Alpacacino!

00:16:30.908 --> 00:16:32.108
Prepare to fire!

00:16:46.318 --> 00:16:47.658
[PANZ grunts]

00:16:51.028 --> 00:16:54.328
I see. These must be the pirate
raiders we've heard about!

00:16:54.328 --> 00:16:57.168
But in that case, why are
they attacking the Navy?

00:17:02.668 --> 00:17:03.668
[ALPACACINO bleats]

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.508
[SHUZO laughing]

00:17:12.808 --> 00:17:14.878
[LUFFY] Hey, Food Guy!
You all right?

00:17:14.878 --> 00:17:17.048
[PANZ grunts]

00:17:17.048 --> 00:17:18.318
I'm all right.

00:17:18.318 --> 00:17:19.348
Where's Lily?

00:17:19.348 --> 00:17:21.788
I'm right here!
Don't worry about me!

00:17:23.058 --> 00:17:25.028
Uh-oh, here it comes!

00:17:25.028 --> 00:17:28.658
Gum-Gum... Balloon!

00:17:28.658 --> 00:17:29.828
[SHUZO]
Move aside!

00:17:29.828 --> 00:17:30.898
It's a dude?

00:17:30.898 --> 00:17:32.498
[SHUZO yells]

00:17:32.498 --> 00:17:34.638
[LUFFY grunts]

00:17:37.708 --> 00:17:40.808
[LUFFY yells]

00:17:43.048 --> 00:17:44.378
[LUFFY yells]

00:17:44.378 --> 00:17:45.408
[LILY]
Luffy!

00:17:50.018 --> 00:17:52.348
Hey, Usopp!
Luffy fell overboard!

00:17:52.348 --> 00:17:53.758
[USOPP]
Right, I'm on it!

00:17:55.358 --> 00:17:57.488
[SHUZO]
Who the hell was that brat?

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:00.498
Oh, well. He's dead.

00:18:00.498 --> 00:18:02.598
Shuzo? No!

00:18:02.598 --> 00:18:04.768
Oh, would you look at this.

00:18:04.768 --> 00:18:06.398
Hello, Momonga.

00:18:06.398 --> 00:18:08.538
I sure didn't expect
to meet you here.

00:18:08.538 --> 00:18:09.668
Let's see.

00:18:09.668 --> 00:18:11.368
You've moved up, haven't you?

00:18:11.368 --> 00:18:12.768
Vice Admiral, I believe?

00:18:12.768 --> 00:18:14.608
Hold on.

00:18:14.608 --> 00:18:17.348
The one who's responsible
for raiding all these pirates...

00:18:17.348 --> 00:18:18.408
It was you?

00:18:18.408 --> 00:18:19.918
[SHUZO laughs]

00:18:19.918 --> 00:18:21.218
That's right!

00:18:21.218 --> 00:18:23.448
And he'll be my next victim.

00:18:23.448 --> 00:18:24.518
Leave him be!

00:18:24.518 --> 00:18:26.048
[SHUZO]
Take a look around you!

00:18:41.038 --> 00:18:44.068
[ALPACACINO bleats]

00:18:51.878 --> 00:18:55.118
[SHUZO] Either hand over the
giant or we sink your ships.

00:18:55.118 --> 00:18:56.418
Am I clear?

00:18:56.418 --> 00:18:57.488
But why?

00:18:57.488 --> 00:18:59.388
You were once
a great Navy soldier.

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:00.958
What happened to you, Shuzo?

00:19:04.888 --> 00:19:06.958
Why, you ask?

00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.828
I'll tell you why.

00:19:08.828 --> 00:19:13.238
Because now I'm a proud
officer of the Neo Navy!

00:19:14.468 --> 00:19:17.008
Our organization exists
to eradicate every pirate

00:19:17.008 --> 00:19:19.508
who dares to cross
into the New World!

00:19:19.508 --> 00:19:21.438
The Navy is foolish
to allow that villain

00:19:21.438 --> 00:19:23.108
to rot away in prison.

00:19:23.108 --> 00:19:27.518
He doesn't deserve
to live after all he's done!

00:19:27.518 --> 00:19:29.788
So in the name of Master Z,

00:19:29.788 --> 00:19:32.988
I'll assassinate Panz Fry,
right here right now!

00:19:32.988 --> 00:19:34.658
Master Z?

00:19:34.658 --> 00:19:36.788
[SHUZO laughing]

00:19:37.988 --> 00:19:39.528
You shouldn't have
told him that!

00:19:39.528 --> 00:19:40.958
Come on!

00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:42.128
[ALPACACINO bleats]

00:19:42.128 --> 00:19:44.768
Uhh... I suppose not.

00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:47.298
[laughs]

00:19:47.298 --> 00:19:48.868
No matter.

00:19:48.868 --> 00:19:52.538
Who cares if you know we plan
to wipe out the pirates.

00:19:52.538 --> 00:19:56.478
You're all about to die
along with them anyway!

00:19:56.478 --> 00:19:57.978
[LILY]
You'll pay for this!

00:19:57.978 --> 00:20:01.218
How dare you hurt my dad
and my friend Luffy!

00:20:01.218 --> 00:20:04.188
[LILY yells]

00:20:04.188 --> 00:20:05.448
[LILY grunts]

00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:13.028
Careful, babe!

00:20:13.028 --> 00:20:15.828
Jeez, we could sure use
Luffy and Mosshead right now.

00:20:18.528 --> 00:20:19.698
And who the hell are you?

00:20:19.698 --> 00:20:20.738
Oh, me?

00:20:20.738 --> 00:20:23.168
Panz Fry's daughter,
Lily Enstomach!

00:20:23.168 --> 00:20:25.038
Not like it's any
of your business!

00:20:25.038 --> 00:20:26.708
Another pirate, huh? Heh!

00:20:32.178 --> 00:20:33.218
Iron Body!

00:20:34.548 --> 00:20:36.048
Three-Section Lariat!

00:20:37.088 --> 00:20:38.518
[SANJI]
Lily!

00:20:42.558 --> 00:20:44.228
Not another one!

00:20:44.228 --> 00:20:45.428
Give up already!

00:20:49.528 --> 00:20:51.568
You're a real piece
of work, aren't you?

00:20:51.568 --> 00:20:53.438
Trying to attack a lady.

00:20:53.438 --> 00:20:54.338
Dirtbag!

00:20:54.338 --> 00:20:55.238
Oh, yeah?

00:20:55.238 --> 00:20:56.738
[BOTH]
Who do you think you are?

00:20:56.738 --> 00:20:58.868
Well, sir.
He's a Straw Hat.

00:20:58.868 --> 00:21:02.108
So we're guessing
he's Black Leg Sanji.

00:21:02.108 --> 00:21:04.708
But uh, he doesn't look anything
like the poster here,

00:21:04.708 --> 00:21:07.218
so we think maybe he's
had some work done?

00:21:07.218 --> 00:21:08.878
[SANJI]
Oh, come on!

00:21:08.878 --> 00:21:10.048
[SHUZO]
All right.

00:21:10.048 --> 00:21:11.718
How high is his bounty?

00:21:11.718 --> 00:21:13.458
[NEO MARINE A]
77 million!

00:21:13.458 --> 00:21:14.858
Heh, is that all?

00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:16.518
What did you just say?!

00:21:16.518 --> 00:21:18.188
He's a pirate.

00:21:18.188 --> 00:21:21.058
Take aim!
We'll sink 'em all!

00:21:21.058 --> 00:21:22.058
[NEO MARINES]
Roger!

00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:25.598
Oh, goodness,
we're in real trouble now!

00:21:25.598 --> 00:21:28.768
Lily! Shrink down!
They're gonna shoot!

00:21:28.768 --> 00:21:29.768
[LILY]
Right!

00:21:42.748 --> 00:21:46.088
[MOMONGA] I don't make a
habit of defending pirates.

00:21:46.088 --> 00:21:47.988
But this is a Navy ship.

00:21:47.988 --> 00:21:50.128
I won't let you
do as you please!

00:21:51.928 --> 00:21:53.088
Heh.

00:21:53.088 --> 00:21:57.398
Well, you seem pretty
smart for a Navy soldier.

00:21:57.398 --> 00:22:00.738
Ha. Making nice
with pirates, huh?

00:22:00.738 --> 00:22:02.938
That's what's wrong
with the Navy.

00:22:02.938 --> 00:22:04.738
You're all spineless!

00:22:04.738 --> 00:22:05.638
How dare you--

00:22:05.638 --> 00:22:07.078
[MOMONGA]
Silence, you traitor!

00:22:14.678 --> 00:22:17.448
It's pirates this. Navy that.

00:22:24.788 --> 00:22:27.158
I've had enough of this crap.

00:22:27.158 --> 00:22:28.328
Straw Hat!

00:22:30.328 --> 00:22:35.538
I will try that volcano cooking,
no matter what!

00:22:35.538 --> 00:22:38.838
Hold on, 400 million?
He must be...

00:22:38.838 --> 00:22:39.808
That's him!

00:22:39.808 --> 00:22:40.978
Straw Hat Luffy!

00:22:40.978 --> 00:22:43.508
Oh? Now that's a bounty.

00:22:43.508 --> 00:22:46.818
[laughs]

00:22:46.818 --> 00:22:48.318
That's excellent!

00:22:48.318 --> 00:22:50.288
I'll kill all of you
in one strike!

00:23:13.238 --> 00:23:15.178
[NARRATOR] A three-way
confrontation ensues

00:23:15.178 --> 00:23:17.148
involving the Straw Hats,
the Navy,

00:23:17.148 --> 00:23:19.148
and the mysterious Neo Navy.

00:23:19.148 --> 00:23:21.378
Each side refuses to back down,

00:23:21.378 --> 00:23:23.418
and just when it looks
like the unpredictable

00:23:23.418 --> 00:23:26.318
Maubeugemour Sea has foiled
their efforts to rescue Panz Fry

00:23:26.318 --> 00:23:27.918
from the clutches of the enemy,

00:23:27.918 --> 00:23:30.228
the stalwart crew makes one last
gambit to pull off

00:23:30.228 --> 00:23:32.028
an unbelievable feat.

00:23:32.028 --> 00:23:33.698
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

00:23:33.698 --> 00:23:35.058
"Z's Ambition!

00:23:35.058 --> 00:23:37.528
A Great and Desperate
Escape Plan!"

00:23:37.528 --> 00:23:39.528
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
