00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280

[LUFFY] "Feudal Era Side Story.
Boss Luffy Appears Again."

38
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:51,462
[NARRATOR]
It is the middle of summer

39
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:53,531
in the legendary city
of Grand Jipang.

40
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:56,568
A place known as a veritable
cornucopia of cultures

41
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:58,670
from all places and times.

42
00:02:58,703 --> 00:03:00,371
Everyone appears
to be as energetic

43
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:02,507
and heated as
the great sun itself.

44
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,509
For example,
this bit of commotion

45
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:06,444
currently under way.

46
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:09,314
[USOPP]
Big news, everyone!

47
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:10,248
Big news!

48
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:13,117
Big news, big news,
big news, big news!

00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,686
[NAMI] "The Great
Portable Shrine Race"?

50
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,520
[USOPP]
Yeah, that's right!

51
00:03:15,553 --> 00:03:17,522
The whole town
is talking about it!

52
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:19,457
It's the biggest
news of the summer!

53
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,259
[NAMI]
Is that so?

54
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,261
"Takes place once
every 100 years".

55
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:24,529
No wonder I've
never heard of it.

56
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:25,897
I, for one, have heard of it!

57
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,600
I've also heard that
the grand prize is incredible!

58
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:29,834
They say when
the race is over,

59
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,436
they present a
sacred treasure

60
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:32,804
from the Grand Shrine
to the winner,

61
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,273
and then they get to make
whatever wish they want!

62
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:37,809
So the treasure
grants wishes, huh?

63
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:41,813
Here. Some cold
water for you.

64
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,382
Oh! Perfect! Just what I needed!

65
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,585
Good stuff!

66
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:49,821
[USOPP]
Thanks, uh... wait. Who are you?

67
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,323
Our newest helping hand.
I just hired her.

68
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,524
I'm Omao.

69
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:54,859
It's a pleasure
to meet you all.

70
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:56,160
[LUFFY]
Seconds, please!

71
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,362
Sure!

72
00:03:57,495 --> 00:03:59,364
All right! A heaping portion!

73
00:03:59,397 --> 00:04:02,433
Good service. You're
gonna fit in just fine!

74
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,237
[NAMI]
I'd go a little easy on

75
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:08,306
the extra food for
that one, Omao-chan.

76
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:10,441
He's just gonna put it
on his never-ending tab

77
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:11,576
and forget about it.

78
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:14,279
Okay!

79
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:16,314
So what is this "sacred
treasure" you mentioned?

80
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:17,315
[CHOPPER]
Oh. Right.

81
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:18,583
Well, according
to the legend,

82
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:20,752
the sacred treasure
has the magical ability

83
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:22,654
to grant any
wish you desire.

84
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:24,689
It's kept in the Grand
Shrine's treasure room,

85
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:28,159
which is only opened
once a century.

86
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:33,865
One policeman supposedly
had his wish granted

87
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,868
and became a great
and powerful samurai.

88
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,803
Another wish
was made by a cook

89
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,571
who married the
prettiest girl in town

90
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:43,541
and lived in complete happiness
for the rest of his life.

91
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,476
[BOTH]
Is that so? Awesome!

92
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,313
You're right, that does
sound pretty awesome.

93
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:51,316
That settles it! Let's enter the
Great Portable Shrine Race!

94
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:54,485
Forget it! I refuse to take part
in some sweaty competition

95
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,621
for some prize that's
probably just a hoax.

96
00:04:56,654 --> 00:04:59,657
There's also a cash prize
of one million Ryo-Berries.

97
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:02,727
[NAMI squeals]
Come on, you guys! Get ready!

98
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,263
We have to win the
Grand Portable Shrine Race!

99
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:07,398
Wouldn't you know,
she's suddenly up for it.

100
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,400
[NAMI] Right. And if
we're going to win,

101
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,670
the first thing we'll
need is a portable shrine.

102
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,506
Okay...

103
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,542
So then, what's our
first stop, Onami?

104
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:18,976
The lumberyard, of course.

105
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,111
[USOPP, CHOPPER]
The lumberyard?

106
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:22,714
I hear the greatest carpenter
in all of Grand Jipang

107
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:26,951
lives there, and we need
nothing but the best!

108
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:28,753
[NAMI]
Hello?

109
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:34,359
There doesn't seem
to be anyone here.

110
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:39,864
[NAMI]
What is this thing?

111
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:42,266
That's a really
nice roll of fabric.

112
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,968

Whoops. Sorry 'bout that!

113
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:46,337
Oh, I--

114
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:50,975

I'm glad you caught it, though!

115
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:53,311
Thanks a lot, little lady!

116
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,682

when I tried drying it with my

119
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:04,655
You shouldn't go out
in public like that!

120
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:06,257
You've gotta cover yourself!

121
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,795
[MOZU, KIWI]
We got here just in time.

122
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,363
My goodness, that
was a close call.

123
00:06:12,397 --> 00:06:13,865
"Just in time" my ass!

124
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:14,999
[FRANKY]
You heard the ladies.

125
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:16,567
I'll need that back now.

126
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:17,769
[NAMI]
Wait, what?

127
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:19,370
[FRANKY]
That cloth.

128
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:21,406
[NAMI]
Uh, do you mean this?

129
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,273
[FRANKY]
Of course I do!

130
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:24,542
I mean, that is
my loincloth, after all.

131
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:26,577
Super, huh?

132
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:35,319
[NAMI]
Your loincloth?

133
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:44,896
[LUFFY] Awesome! What's
this doohickey with the face?

134
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:46,497
[FRANKY]
Oh, you mean this old thing?

135
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,801
That's my Super Drying
Clockwork Fun Fan Sunny Wind.

Glad you like it!

137
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:52,804
That's the coolest thing ever!

138
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:55,673
His loincloth...

139
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,776
It landed right on my face.

140
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,011
So then!

141
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,712
What kind of super
portable shrine

142
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:03,748
do you want me to
make for you fellas?

143
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:05,416
Well, I guess the
most important thing--

144
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,819
Is that it can win the
portable shrine race!

145
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:08,886
Well yeah, that.

146
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,621
But it needs to
look awesome too,

147
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:12,824
so we'll look cool
crossing the finish line.

148
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,926
Winning might be harder
than we first thought.

149
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,461
The other teams
who are participating

150
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:18,996
all sound pretty
tough, if you ask me.

151
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:24,569
[CHOPPER] First, there are the
legendary Flying Fish Riders.

152
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:27,104
The fastest gang in
all of Grand Jipang.

153
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:31,075
Then, there's Rolling Express,

154
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:34,345
who are speedy
in racing and love.

155
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:35,379
[LOLA SHRINE]

156
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,648
I like you a lot! Marry me!

Marry me! Marry me!

158
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,054
Looks like both of those teams
have really good track records.

159
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,723
And those are just
the ones on top of the list.

160
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:48,459
What is the
"Thriller Company?"

161
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:49,694

I don't know.

00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:52,163
I've never heard
of them before.

[groaning]

167
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:17,588
So who are these weirdos?

168
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,023
Pretty sure they're
the ones you guys

169
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:21,792
were just talkin' about:
The Thriller Company.

170
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:24,462
[FRANKY] They specialize
in import and wholesale.

171
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:26,797
They recently moved
into a 13-story tower

172
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:30,835
that was built over
in the Foreign District.

173
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:32,537
[USOPP] Are you guys here
to request a portable shrine

174
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,038
for the race
tomorrow too, or what?

Don't be silly!

00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,145
[PERONA laughs]
No, we were just stopping by

178
00:08:41,178 --> 00:08:43,447
to pay you a little
courtesy call.

179
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,716
And tell you it's pointless
for you to enter the race.

180
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,985
And just what exactly
are you trying to imply?

181
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:48,986
Yeah, jerks!

182
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,123
Maybe it's pointless for
you to enter the race!

183
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,659
My, she's a feisty one.

184
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:55,593
Just my type.

185
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,862
Opinions aside,
it's in your best interest

186
00:08:57,895 --> 00:08:58,963
to heed our advice.

187
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,898
You don't want to
get hurt, do you?

188
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:03,067
Cindry, don't stand in
front of me while I talk.

189
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,971
Your threats don't scare us.
We have a secret weapon!

190
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:07,972
This is Boss Luffy.

191
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:12,677
A freeloading policeman
and our key to victory!

192
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,546
[HOGBACK laughing]
Come, everyone.

193
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,848
Let's take our leave.
But, heed my words!

194
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:21,886
You'll be sorry if you dare
oppose the Thriller Company!

195
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,590
[HOGBACK laughing]

196
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:26,724
[LUFFY]
Hey.

197
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:29,694
Your friends left without you.
Thought you should know.

198
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:34,115
[HOGBACK screams]
They-- They ditched me!

199
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:38,452
[HOGBACK]
All right!

200
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:39,654
You have been warned!

201
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:41,489
Beware!

202
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:43,457
Now what was that
all about? Jeez!

203
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:46,027
Oh, man! What a weirdo!

204
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,329
Of all the nerve! It doesn't
get much creepier!

205
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:49,363
Don't worry about them.

206
00:09:49,397 --> 00:09:51,198
They think they
can intimidate us,

207
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:52,667
but they're just
wasting their time.

208
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,036
[FRANKY]
Listen up, everyone!

209
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:57,471
Don't you dare lose to
those weird little creeps!

210
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:59,373
I'm gonna build you
the most super portable

211
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:01,542
shrine the world
has ever seen!

212
00:10:01,575 --> 00:10:02,977
So you better win, got it?

213
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:03,678
We got it!

214
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:05,112
You can count on us!

215
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,415
Alright, guys, we gonna
win this thing, or what?

216
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:09,050
[ALL]
Yeah!

217
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,154
[DUVAL] Let's go!

218
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:18,125
[MINIONS]
Heave ho, heave ho, heave ho...

219
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,495
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

220
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:23,264
I can't hear you!

221
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:25,166
[ZORO]
What's with all the racket?

222
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:27,368
I'm trying to sleep here!

223
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:29,337
[DUVAL]
Stop! Stop!

224
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,504
That chant sucks!

225
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:32,406
What are you,
palanquin carriers?

226
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,574
[FISH RIDER 386A]
Sorry, sir!

227
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:35,609
We couldn't think
of anything else.

228
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:37,378
[DUVAL]
Well, work those brains harder!

229
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:39,313
There's gotta be
something more worthy

230
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,481
of the Flying Fish Riders,

231
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,985
the fastest gang in
all of Grand Jipang!

232
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:47,321
Handsome, handsome, handsome!

233
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,389
That's more like it!

234
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:51,058
Say it again! And again!

235
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:52,426
At least they're leaving.

236
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,395
With their chant
and my awesome face,

237
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:56,297
there's no way we can lose!

238
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,531
And then!

239
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:02,670
[DUVAL FANGIRL 406A]
Duval-sama!

240
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,704
You're so wonderful!

241
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:05,606
[DUVAL FANGIRL 406B]
I declare my love to you!

242
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,340
All you lovely ladies who
want a kiss, just form a line.

243
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:11,379
You cut in line?

244
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:13,080
Oh, that's so naughty of you!

245
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:13,914
Don't worry!

246
00:11:13,948 --> 00:11:16,450
There's enough
of me to go around!

247
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:18,919
You idiots!

248
00:11:18,953 --> 00:11:20,755
What in the hell is
going on down there?

249
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:21,856
[FISH RIDER 388A]
Sorry, Boss!

250
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,691
It looks like we're
suddenly missing four people!

251
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,092
That's impossible.

252
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:25,760
Count again!

253
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:27,495
Everyone sound off!

254
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:28,062
[FISH RIDER 386A] One!

255
00:11:28,095 --> 00:11:29,430
[FISH RIDER 388A] Two!

256
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:30,297
[FISH RIDER 387A] Three!

257
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:31,165
[FISH RIDER 388E] Four!

258
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:32,199
[ZOMBIE 406A] Five.

259
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,401
[ZOMBIE 406B] Six.

260
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:34,335
[ZOMBIE HIPPO] Seven.

261
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:35,436
[KUMACY grunts]

262
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:37,705
See? Nobody is missing.
We're all here!

263
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,106
[FISH RIDER 387A]
So we are!

264
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,177
[ALL laughing]

265
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,112
Who the hell are you?

266
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:46,313
[ZOMBIE HIPPO]
Oh, just some zombies

267
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:48,049
that were passing by.

268
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,517
Zombies?

269
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,521
Hey! What did you jerks
do with our friends?

270
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:56,424
Why did I act so tough?

271
00:11:56,524 --> 00:11:58,025
[FISH RIDER 387A]
I'm just a big,

272
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:00,094
loud stain on society.

273
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,462
[FISH RIDER 388F]
I just wanted someone

274
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:03,230
to pay attention to me.

275
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,399
Sorry, zombies. I'm not
even good enough for you

276
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,767
to make soup out of me.

277
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:07,568
Whoa, you guys,

278
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,337
why are you so
down in the dumps?

279
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,174
That would be
because I did this!

280
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:15,409
Negative Hollow!

281
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:24,452
[DUVAL] Oh, I'm depressed!
Totally depressed!

282
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:26,220
Extremely depressed!

283
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:27,455
Boss, what's wrong?

284
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:29,356
Carrying shrines,
winning stupid races.

285
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,724
None of these things matter!

286
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:33,527
They won't help us make
it in this crazy world!

287
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:35,296
[DUVAL] This big pile
of junk ain't nothing

288
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:36,664
but a stinkin' pipe dream!

289
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:39,133
It's as useless as me!

290
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,570
[FISH RIDERS] Boss, please!
Get a hold of yourself!

291
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:44,738
Well, that's another
one down, huh?

292
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,332
[USOPP]
Nothing's biting.

293
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:15,603
Yes! Got one!

294
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,739
Alright! Now come on!
Whoa! This thing's huge!

295
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:22,143
I won't let you beat me!

296
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:25,446
There we go! Let's see what--

297
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:28,449
[USOPP]
Bones...

298
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:29,483
on...

299
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,885
a...

300
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:31,886
piece...

301
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,254
[BROOK] Help...
[USOPP] of...

302
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:35,422
[BROOK] me...
[USOPP] wood!

303
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:38,392
[BROOK] Help me. Please?
[USOPP screams]

304
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:43,731
[USOPP screaming]

305
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,683
I don't know who he is,
but he sure does eat a lot.

306
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,351
He sure does!

307
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,287
Yeah, he also doesn't
know the first damn thing

308
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,254
about table manners.

309
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:09,857
Come on. Why do all
of our customers suck?

310
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,194
[LUFFY]
You sure like to eat, huh?

311
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,196
Can we get some
more yakitori over here?

312
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,931
You're no better than he is!

313
00:14:16,964 --> 00:14:18,399
Here's the bill. Thank you!

314
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:19,667
Why do I get it?

315
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:26,407
I must say, that was
a delectable meal!

316
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,543
My complements to the chef
and for your hospitality.

317
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,646
Stop it already, you swine!
Who the hell are you?

318
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,515
[BROOK]
My apologies.

319
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:36,417
Please excuse my
late introduction.

320
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,552
I'm Brook, all
dead and bones.

321
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,422
It's truly an honor to make
your acquaintance, all of you.

322
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:44,425
I was born...

323
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,260
I was born in...

324
00:14:47,394 --> 00:14:49,630
Wow, I forget. Oh, well.

325
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:50,931
When you introduce yourself.

326
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:52,833
You gotta get all
the way to the end,

327
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:55,269
not stop in the middle!
I mean, not that I care.

328
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:56,170
I know it's strange,

329
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:58,405
but all I seem to
remember is my name.

330
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,406
[rattling]

331
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,475
It's possible that some
sort of traumatic shock

332
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:02,776
caused you to
lose your memory.

333
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,746
[BROOK sighs]
[rattling]

334
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,614
Hey, uh...

335
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:08,782
Is it just me,
or is there something

336
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,351
rattling around
in your head?

337
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:12,886
That explains it:
He's got a screw loose.

338
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,289
My, how uncouth!

339
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:16,590
You can open your skull?

340
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,891
That's so awesome!

341
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:20,861
Oh! Look at that!
I found something!

342
00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:24,598
It looks like a flute.
A wooden one.

343
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,966
A flute?

344
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,868
What the hell!

345
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:29,670
How can you store
things like that in there?

346
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:33,841
Oh, wow! Man, Brook,
you sure are a funny guy.

347
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:47,321
Well?

348
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:50,524
[USOPP laughs] I gotta admit,
it looks pretty good on you!

349
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:08,042
[KIDS]
Ah!

350
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:10,477

[crazy laghter]

354
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:04,381
[HOGBACK] The Flying Fish Riders
have dropped out, too.

355
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:06,550
That leaves only
the Rolling Express

356
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,686
and those imbeciles
at the Pinwheel Eatery!

357
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,588
Once they're gone,
victory will belong to

358
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:14,725
the Thriller Company
without so much as a fight!

359
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:16,927
[PERONA laughing]

360
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,729
The race is tomorrow.

361
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:20,731
I think it's about
time to finish this off.

362
00:17:20,764 --> 00:17:22,800
Let's go, Absalom.

363
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,469
Watch who you're
ordering around.

364
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,703
I know what to do.

[HOGBACK laughing]

366
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:31,775

some dastardly deeds!

[HOGBACK laughing]

368
00:17:33,944 --> 00:17:35,479
[HOGBACK]
Oh, for crying out loud, Cindry.

369
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,681
Why do you keep doing that?

370
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,461
Hello, everyone!

371
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:51,895
Take a break
and have some food!

372
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:53,597
[FRANKY]
Right! Hey, thanks for that!

373
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,365
[MOZU, KIWI]
Thank you!

374
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,093
Huh?

375
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,962
[LOLA]
Who's taking our shrine?

376
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:26,096
[RISKY BROTHER A]
No idea!

377
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,998

I don't see anybody!

[RISKY BROTHER A]
No way! It's floating!

380
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,438
Oh, man! I am
completely stuffed!

381
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:35,606
That food was great!

382
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:38,008
[BROOK laughs]
Goodness, being around you

383
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,544
makes me eat far too much!

384
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,880
Looking at this bill,
I'm inclined to agree.

385
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,682
Huh?

386
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:47,484
[USOPP]
What the--? How?

387
00:18:47,518 --> 00:18:48,719
[LUFFY]
That shrine is flying!

Somebody stop that thing!

390
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,457
After it!

391
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,659
Right!

00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:57,661
[LOLA] Thank you! I
appreciate the help.

[LOLA] Will you marry me?
[LUFFY] No way.

394
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:00,964
[RISKY BROTHERS]
Rejection!

395
00:19:00,998 --> 00:19:03,901
That makes the 4,450th one!

00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,737
[ABSALOM]
This thing sure is heavy.

397
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,539
[LUFFY]
Get back here!

398
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:11,141
Stop floating, you dumb shrine!

00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:21,084

need this right now!

Wow, Brook, I had no
idea you were so strong.

414
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,864
Indeed.

415
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:11,034
I had no idea that I
was so strong, either.

Oh, hey Sanji and O-Nami!

That doesn't look good.

It's over!

424
00:20:30,654 --> 00:20:33,156
There's no way we can
enter the big race now.

425
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,860
And it was such
a beautiful shrine, too.

426
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:38,262
I was sure my
husband would be

427
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:41,231
waiting for me at
the finish line.

428
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:42,866
If their plan
was to wipe out

429
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:44,534
all the portable
shrines before the race,

430
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:46,737
then that means
ours is in danger, too!

431
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,771

That would mean Omao-chan

433
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:51,108
What makes you say that?

She delivered
some lunchboxes

435
00:20:52,576 --> 00:20:54,745
to the Franky Workshop,
but never came back.

My head hurts
and it's killing me.

My eyes have gone hazy.

452
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,660
Well, that is,
if I wasn't already dead

453
00:21:43,694 --> 00:21:46,997
and actually had eyes.

454
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,932
That's a creepy
thing to joke about.

[BROOK gasps]

456
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:08,985
I remember what happened.

457
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:10,354
You got your memory back?

458
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:12,055
Yes.

459
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:16,026
I remember everything now.

460
00:22:19,363 --> 00:22:21,331
Hey, what's with the
hat and that get-up?

461
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:22,999
Cuz it looks like
you're leaving.

462
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:24,601
I shouldn't be
here with you,

463
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,902
from what I remember.

464
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:29,239
And I'm ashamed
to say this...

465
00:22:29,272 --> 00:22:32,709
I believe that I'm actually a
member of the Thriller Company.

466
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:34,077
But that can't be true!

467
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:35,979
Brook-san, no!

468
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:40,083
There you go again!

469
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:42,753
That's enough of
your stupid jokes.

Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

Wait!

[NAMI] What's with those
Thriller Company guys?

473
00:23:16,386 --> 00:23:18,422
And I don't mean the
fact that half of them

474
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:19,389
are weird animal things,

475
00:23:19,423 --> 00:23:21,057
I mean the fact that
they're all cheaters!

476
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:22,292
[USOPP]
Yeah! They're gonna pay!

want, it's a fight they'll get!
