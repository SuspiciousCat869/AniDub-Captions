WEBVTT

00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:04.537
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:07.440
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.243
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.545
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.748
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.550
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.886
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.922
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.392
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:30.430
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:36.022
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.992
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:43.196
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.664
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:47.867
a boy whose body became rubber
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:51.604
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:55.808
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:02.015
[NARRATOR] After a fierce battle
at the bottom of the sea,

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:04.551
the Straw Hat Pirates depart
for the deadly waters

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:08.621
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:11.291
Responding to a
nearby distress call,

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:13.393
Luffy and company were
met with a surprise

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:15.895
on the flaming island
of Punk Hazard.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:19.365
[roars]

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:24.671
[KIN'EMON] Poot! I feel a breeze
all of a sudden, how curious!

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:25.505
Huh?!

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.307
You won't believe this!

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.678
There's some weird fancy-pants
guy stuck in the dragon's back!

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.780
[ZORO]
One-Sword Style.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.015
[ZORO]
Iai.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.586
Death Lion Song! You're done!

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.889
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, the Sunny
suffered a surprise attack.

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:45.091
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 580A]
Tie them all up!

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:46.893
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATES]
Right!

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:48.394
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 580A]
It's a good thing they're just

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:50.597
lowlife pirates.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.368
So no one's even going to
miss them. How convenient.

00:03:56.536 --> 00:03:57.837
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 580A]
The master will be

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.939
pleased with this.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.845
[LUFFY]
"The Straw Hats Stunned!

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:09.549
Enter: A Samurai's
Horrifying Severed Head!"

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:19.959
So.

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:23.062
What should we do
about the, uh, legs?

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.565
[giggles] Pull 'em out!

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.268
[KIN'EMON] Poot!
Unhand me, you ruffian!

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.469
How dare you!

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:32.872
[LUFFY] Hey! I'm trying to
help you, here! Stop squirmin'!

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:35.041
--C'mon.
--[KIN'EMON] Poot!

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:37.577
Wow. He is really
stuck in there.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.779
I wonder how he
ended up that way?

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.714
Like, how does that even work?

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.783
If his head is stuck,
how is he talking,

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.551
or breathing for that matter?

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.253
None of this makes any sense.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.988
So you think he
lives here or what?

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:50.923
[LUFFY grunts]

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.425
[KIN'EMON gasps]

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:55.461
[ALL gasp]

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:58.898
[USOPP screams]
Quick! Put it back!

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:02.135
[LUFFY]
Hm? Put what back?

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:07.240
[LUFFY gasps]

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:09.609
[screams] I broke him!

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:10.777
Sorry!

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.346
"Sorry" is all you have to say?!

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.081
He's dead now!

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:18.084
[LUFFY, USOPP screaming]

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:21.521
[KIN'EMON grunts] Oh. It seems
I've been liberated.

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:24.624
[USOPP, LUFFY gasp]
What?!

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:27.760
[LUFFY] He's still alive?!
And his legs can talk?!

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:32.498
[USOPP]
It's a monster! A zombie!

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:34.000
[ROBIN]
Wait a second.

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:35.968
There's no upper body anywhere.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:38.871
Nor is there a mark on the
dragon where he was stuck.

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:40.306
[LUFFY, USOPP, ZORO]
Huh?

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.108
Yeah, I don't get it.

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:46.012
So, then the guy was
just legs all along?

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:49.349
Whoa. This is pretty weird, huh?

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:53.419
[USOPP]
Huh. He looks kind of big.

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:56.689
[KIN'EMON]
I know you are there,

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:58.858
but I cannot discern
your intent.

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:02.528
With neither eyes nor ears,
I can only sense your presence.

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:05.131
Wow, you're smart,
well, for legs.

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:08.434
[KIN'EMON] Poot! Whoever
you are, get out of my way!

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.403
[LUFFY]
Calm down!

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:12.972
[KIN'EMON] I refuse to die
in a place like this!

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:14.540
I have a mission to carry out!

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:15.575
[LUFFY]
He's running away!

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:18.044
[KIN'EMON] I will not
suffer this indignity!

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:21.381
Prepare yourself, Warlord!
I'm coming for you!

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:26.753
[LUFFY gasps] Hey, wait! Legs!
Come and join my crew!

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:28.755
Would you cut that out?

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:31.190
Guys, wait here
while go I catch him!

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:34.327
Roast up that dragon and we'll
have a barbecue when I get back!

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.363
I'm comin' for you, leg monster!

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.932
Ugh. This worked out with Brook,

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:43.369
but I'm kind of iffy about
having legs on the crew.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:47.206
It's troubling that they
mentioned one of the Warlords.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.111
Does that mean there's a Warlord
lurking somewhere on the island?

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:56.949
No! That's way too much!
I don't wanna fight!

00:06:56.983 --> 00:07:00.653
Now can we leave? Pretty please?

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:07.794
Hey! Come back, Leg Monster!

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:10.797
[KIN'EMON gasps]

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.800
[KIN'EMON] Ow, ow,
hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:16.269
He doesn't know where
he's going, huh?

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:18.237
[gasps] Stop!

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:22.241
You're gonna hit that wall!

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.943
[KIN'EMON]
Someone's here!

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:28.915
[LUFFY groans]
Ow, ow!

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.619
[KIN'EMON]
Poot! Who are you?

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:37.323
They certainly are a
dogged pursuer, and yet,

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:40.660
I sense no hostile intent
from them whatsoever.

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:43.329
What is their objective?

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.565
[groans] He's fast.

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:46.699
[KIN'EMON]
Poot!

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:50.002
I know not what you desire
of me, but heed my words.

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:52.939
If you stand in my way,
you shall regret it!

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.641
What? Why do you
think I'm your enemy?

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:59.645
Stop running away
and join my crew!

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.182
[KIN'EMON]
Poot! What sorcery is this?

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:05.818
[LUFFY laughs]
Gotcha!

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:07.787
[KIN'EMON]
Unhand me, you knave!

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.821
Sure!

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:10.456
All you gotta do...

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.960
...is join my crew!

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.233
[KIN'EMON groans]

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:23.002
[KIN'EMON sighs]

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.872
Huh? Oops!

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:28.541
[LUFFY groaning]

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:34.113
[LUFFY chuckles]
Wow, that was funny!

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:36.148
Uh, you're not hurt, are you?

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:40.419
[LUFFY gasps]
Huh?! What the?!

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:50.496
[USOPP]
Weird. So how does that work?

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.398
Beats me.

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:56.302
Nice job! This dragon's good!

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:58.771
By the way, what d'you
call people like this?

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:03.676
Huh? Umm. With four legs?

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:07.413
[USOPP]
A centaur, I guess?

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:11.250
[LUFFY laughs]
I'm a centaur!

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:14.587
This is awesome! [laughs]

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.089
Why do these legs
keep getting stuck?

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:19.091
First the dragon, now Luffy?

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:22.295
[LUFFY laughs]
We're a team now!

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:23.362
[KIN'EMON]
Curses!

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.932
I seem to have affixed
myself to something again!

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:28.267
Poot! Cease this!

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:31.037
Luffy, that's vulgar. Stop.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.738
Y'think so?

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:35.675
[LUFFY groans]

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:37.877
[USOPP]
Just 'cause he's stuck to you

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.478
doesn't mean he has to listen--

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:42.381
He's probably got his own head
calling the shots somewhere.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.650
Let him go and
maybe he'll find it.

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:47.286
[laughs]

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.356
Mister Stickylegs was
born like this! Duh!

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:53.159
You need to get with the
program, Usopp! Right?

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:54.994
C'mon. That's ridiculous.

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:57.296
Hey! Are you coming
with us, or what?

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.031
[LUFFY] I wonder if
he's got a real name.

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:01.033
[USOPP] By the way, since you're
the only one who's gonna

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:03.569
be eating all this meat,
why don't you carry it?

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.670
Get the legs to help!

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:06.772
[LUFFY laughs]

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.245
Hey, come up here!
I found something weird!

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:17.216
[LUFFY] Yeah? Any clues about
the samurai or the other dude?

00:10:18.517 --> 00:10:19.819
Look.

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:20.720
Whoa!

00:10:20.753 --> 00:10:24.290
Agh. What now? Uh--

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:32.131
[USOPP] Snow! There's snow
on those mountains!

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:36.936
[USOPP] Actually,
I think those are glaciers!

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.872
[USOPP]
Everything's on fire over here,

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:43.075
but the other side of
the lake is frozen solid?

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:45.011
I could go for some
cool weather right now,

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:46.679
but this is ridiculous!

00:10:46.712 --> 00:10:48.948
How did it get like this?

00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:51.117
That solves one
mystery at least.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.385
Like what?

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:53.419
Oh, wait!

00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:55.688
Why that guy said
he was cold, you mean?

00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:58.758
[RANDOM MAN 579A sobs]
Someone help!

00:10:58.791 --> 00:10:59.825
What's wrong?

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:03.195
[RANDOM MAN 579A]
Please! It's cold. We need Boss!

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:06.966
My friends are getting
cut down one after another!

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:09.402
The samurai is gonna kill us!

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:13.439
So then, if we wanna find the
samurai and that other guy,

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:15.574
we have to switch sides.

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:20.413
Wow, this place is fun!

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:22.581
We can cross that lake, right?

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:23.916
I'm getting hot.

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:25.985
I wanna make snowcones!

00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:29.121
Get real! We'd freeze
to death over there!

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:30.423
That lake's too big!

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:32.091
Let's go back for now!

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:33.092
Cold, huh?

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:34.460
That's not much better.

00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:37.063
We'll be fine. If we can
find some wild animals,

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:38.798
we can skin them and make coats.

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:39.899
You're nuts!

00:11:39.932 --> 00:11:42.501
The only thing we'll find
over there is ice cubes!

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.270
[LUFFY]
Perfect for snowcones!

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:46.672
[USOPP] Wait, can't we
talk this over, Luffy!

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:49.175
No, not you, too, guys!

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.444
Well, I'm not going! No way!

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:54.747
Sure, it's hot over here, but at
least I can avoid the fire.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.916
I'll freeze to death
right away in the cold!

00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:59.819
It's not gonna work!

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.053

[USOPP screams]

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:40.826
[USOPP]
A monster!

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.728
[USOPP screaming]

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.029
[ZORO]
Hm?

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:45.965
Ow!

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:47.399
Ow. What the hell--

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:49.401
There was a bird.

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:53.205
Only it was also a human
somehow--I dunno, it was weird!

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:55.374
Huh? What're you talking about?

00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:57.543
Look. There's nothing there.

00:12:57.576 --> 00:13:00.546
[gasps] Huh?

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:08.320
[ZORO] Enough excuses.
Let's get moving already.

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:10.256
[USOPP] I know I don't
have the best track record,

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:11.690
but I'm serious this time!

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:12.992
There was a monster!

00:13:13.025 --> 00:13:15.294
You gotta believe me!

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:37.082
[CAESAR CLOWN chuckling]

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:49.395
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 580A]
I'm here to report, Master.

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:54.800
We seized several intruders.
They appear to be pirates, sir.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.373
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Well, isn't that just splendid.

00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:03.142
And perfect timing!

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:06.979
We were running low on
guinea pigs after all.

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:12.685
[CAESAR CLOWN laughing]

[CAESAR CLOWN chuckles]

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:45.618
[CAESAR CLOWN] My, what a
fascinating group of specimens

00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:48.087
you've assembled for me.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.624
I'm sure they'll be eager
to contribute to my research.

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:52.625
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 580A]
Yes.

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:56.395
I thought you would find
the cyborg interesting.

00:14:56.428 --> 00:14:59.431
Yes, what a rare find!

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:01.300
I'm sure my metal
friend here has

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:07.206
all sort of fascinating things
to teach me! [chuckles]

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:09.275
Is this all of the trespassers?

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:10.476
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 580A]
There was another body

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:12.745
on their ship, but it's
of no consequence.

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:14.346
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Huh?

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.848
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 580A]
It seems to be a crewmate

00:15:15.881 --> 00:15:17.716
that they murdered.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.319
That is to say,
only a skeleton remained.

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:23.122
Such brutality is not
unusual among pirates.

00:15:23.155 --> 00:15:26.125
I see. Very well.

00:15:26.158 --> 00:15:29.628
For now, take them away,
and lock them up tight.

00:15:29.662 --> 00:15:31.630
We'll have our fun later.

00:15:31.664 --> 00:15:35.334
[chuckling]

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:48.080
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 581A]
Search the ship.

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:50.749
Secure any food or
valuable materials.

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.051
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATES]
Yes, sir.

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:56.588
[BROOK]
Oh, my head is so fuzzy.

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:57.823
What was I doing?

00:15:57.856 --> 00:16:00.326
Where did everyone go?

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:02.361
Who are these people?

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.700
[BROOK] It was hot before,
but now it's so cold!

00:16:07.733 --> 00:16:10.035
Please don't tell me
I slept until the winter.

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:12.938
Ah... Ah... Ahchoo!

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:13.939
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATES]
Huh?

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:14.940
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 581A]
Another pirate?

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:17.009
Wait. It can't be!

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:20.779
Uh, the weather today
is truly bone-chilling!

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:25.050
Though in my case, that's not
really saying much. [laughs]

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:26.218
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATES gasp]

00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:27.286
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 581A]
The skeleton's talking?!

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:28.787
This ship is cursed!

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:33.492
Umm. Whoever you gentlemen are,
could you direct me to my crew?

00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:35.127
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 581A]
Sh-Shoot it! Shoot it!

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.129
Huh? Wait! No shooting!

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:38.664
Let's not be hasty!

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:41.400

Huh...?

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:02.021
[SANJI panting]

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:05.324
Sanji, what's all this
kicking about, man?

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:07.259
[SANJI]
Good, you're up.

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:09.194
[NAMI]
Can't you see for yourself?

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:11.063
They locked us up, Franky!

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:14.733
We're done for,
I tell you, we're done for!

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:18.404
Huh? Huh? Huh?!

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:23.409
Hey! What the heck happened?
What is this freaky place?

00:17:23.442 --> 00:17:25.778
I know I was eating that dessert
on the deck of the Sunny

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:29.681
and then I... I don't
remember anything!

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:31.016
None of us do.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.452
We must've been hit
with sleeping gas.

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:34.953
Then, when we passed out,

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:36.922
someone must've dragged us
off to this place.

00:17:36.955 --> 00:17:38.257
No way.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.393
I do remember the ship
getting hit with some kinda gas.

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:42.628
--[FRANKY] Huh?
--I'm sorry.

00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:45.898
If I'd noticed it sooner,
we wouldn't be here.

00:17:56.508 --> 00:18:01.080
[FRANKY sighs]
And we can't break out, huh?

00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:03.982
Maybe they wanna
sell us as slaves!

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:05.384
Or suck our blood!

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:07.786
If they took everyone
on the Sunny,

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.254
then what happened to Brook?

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:12.724
I don't know. It was
just us when we woke up.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.393
It's 'cause he's a skeleton!

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:17.229
He doesn't have any blood
to drink, so they left him!

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:19.498
Do you think they'll
drink my cola, too?

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:22.301
Both of you, shut up!

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:23.735

[KIN'EMON]
I know not from where you hail,

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.347
but if you are
proficient in puzzles,

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.350
I have one in the
form of my head.

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:39.718

Huh?

00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:44.356

is talking to us.

But it talks.

00:18:57.336 --> 00:18:59.371

are pieces of my face.

number of parts, though.

may still be somewhat awry.

But, it's good enough.

I'm grateful.

some manner of sorcery!

He severed my limbs
but I did not bleed.

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:29.361
I did not die.

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:31.296
I was denied a warrior's death.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.533
Instead, I suffered
this indignity.

[ROBIN] It seems we can't
go around the lake.

It's too large.
We'll have to cross it.

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:50.215
All right, but the
question is how?

Hey, guys. Yeah, I think...

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:55.487
I think I'm just gonna
lie down and die instead.

Don't feel bad!
Your legs have pants!

00:21:56.915 --> 00:21:58.283
Hey, what kind are they?

00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.185
[chuckles] I dunno!

00:22:00.218 --> 00:22:02.721
[KIN'EMON]
Poot! Where in blazes am I?

00:22:02.754 --> 00:22:04.656
Huh? Don't freak out!

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.559
Wait, were your legs
talking just now?

00:22:07.592 --> 00:22:08.727
[LUFFY]
Yep!

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.830
[gasps] I thought I was cool
when I got a muscle shirt

00:22:11.863 --> 00:22:15.967
to match my legs, but I've
never seen talking legs before!

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:18.370
[LUFFY]
Me either!

00:22:18.403 --> 00:22:19.471
Oh, great.

00:22:19.504 --> 00:22:22.407
Now he's gonna ask that
freakshow to join the crew.

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:25.210
A... leopard centaur?

00:22:26.244 --> 00:22:30.949
[MALE BAD GUY 581A]
One, two, three.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.252
[MALE BAD GUY 581A]
Four intruders.

00:22:34.286 --> 00:22:38.557
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL 581A ringing]

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.158
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL 581A]
Cu-lick.

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.928
[MONET]
Well? Did you find them?

00:22:42.961 --> 00:22:44.830
Yeah. They're right here.

00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:47.199
I've got all four
of 'em in my sights.

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:50.836
I'll take them out. Don't worry.

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:52.571
I see.

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:56.508
You have fun with that.

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:58.577
Give me a ring when
you're done, all right?

00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:59.845
[MALE BAD GUY 581A]
Roger.

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:01.213
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL 581B]
Cu-lick.

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:05.384
[MONET chuckles]

00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:20.365
[NARRATOR] A new crisis
befalls Luffy's group

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:21.967
in the Burning Lands.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.703
Meanwhile, Sanji and
friends escape after hearing

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:27.105
the schocking words
of a samurai head.

00:23:27.139 --> 00:23:29.708
Upon fleeing, they wander
into another room,

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:31.543
where they discover
the terrible secret

00:23:31.576 --> 00:23:33.912
regarding this enigmatic island.

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:35.614
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.647 --> 00:23:39.551
"Startling! The Secret of the
Island is Finally Revealed!"

00:23:39.584 --> 00:23:42.354
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
