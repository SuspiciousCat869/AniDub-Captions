1
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,691
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,327
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,731
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,567
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,303
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,005
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,974
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,844
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,412
they capture the
unwanted attention

10
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,980
of the World Government,

11
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,217
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,754
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:11,057
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,260
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:19,098
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,370
[NARRATOR] Separated from
his crew, Luffy has broken out

17
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,040
of Impel Down, and now,
with his newfound cohorts,

18
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,543
is headed to Navy HQ to
rescue his brother Ace,

19
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,779
who's scheduled for execution.

20
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,251
[LUFFY] "A Special Retrospective
Before Marineford!

21
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,320
The Vow of the Brotherhood!"

22
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,940
That Vivre card,
it's Ace's, right?

23
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,108
Uh-huh.

24
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,384
Ace spoke of you often. I gather
the two of you were quite close.

25
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,253
He said you were
inseparable in your youth

26
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,422
and that you went on many
fine adventures together.

27
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,457
Sure did.

28
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,293
We used to race each
other all the time, too.

29
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,263
[LUFFY]
Hey! You jerk!

30
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,466
You're not gonna beat me
this time! Just wait!

31
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,802
[JIMBEI]
He said you ate together.

32
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,438
Took naps together.

33
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,974
Even honed your skills together.

34
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,810
Take this!

35
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,980
[yelps]

36
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,317
[LUFFY screaming]

37
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:56,362
[ACE] Heh. You're still a
long way from kicking my butt.

38
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,801
[JIMBEI]
"Those were the best of times."

39
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,838
Well, that's the way your
brother used to put it,

40
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:06,806
at least.

41
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,207
I always tried to beat the guy,

42
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,209
but I never could
quite pull it off.

43
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,812
Ya know, he hadn't even
eaten the Devil Fruit then,

44
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,981
but I still wasn't
a match for him.

45
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,783
And then he took off to sea.

46
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,451
Three years before you, I hear.

47
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,153
Did you ever see him after that?

48
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,756
I did. It was way back
when I was in Alabasta.

49
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,196
[ACE] Well I guess giving you a
chance to escape was pointless.

50
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,130
[LUFFY]
Hey!

51
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,231
[ACE chuckles]

52
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,733
Hiya, Ace!

53
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,403
It's been awhile, hasn't it?

54
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,372
You could say that.

55
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,742
It was just to let you know

56
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,178
that I'd be in Alabasta
for a few days.

57
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,580
I'm in these waters
on some business.

58
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,982
Business, huh?

59
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,685
Yeah, I'm with the
Whitebeard Pirates.

60
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,320
Catch.

61
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,556
The Whitebeard Pirates?

62
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,857
[ACE]
See this tattoo?

63
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,159
That's our mark.
And it's my pride.

64
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,527
[LUFFY]
Huh.

65
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,032
So, Luffy, why don't you and
your friends come join us?

66
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,035
C'mon, it'll be fun,
whaddaya say?

67
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,069
No, thanks.

68
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,739
[ACE laughing]

69
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,707
I had a feeling you'd say that.

70
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,109
That's too bad, 'cause you see,

71
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:20,213
Whitebeard's the greatest
pirate I've ever met.

72
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:24,217
That's why I'm going to help
him become King of the Pirates.

73
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,686
And not you, Luffy. Sorry.

74
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,622
That's fine. I guess we'll
just have to fight then.

75
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:32,525
[LUFFY, USOPP, CHOPPER]
Cheers!

76
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,961
Wait, who said I was
joining your crew?

77
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:40,400
Ace, you sure you don't
wanna join us? It'll be fun.

78
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,269
I can't right now,
I'm chasing someone.

79
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,073
He's a pirate named Blackbeard.

80
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,441
You see, Blackbeard used to be

81
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,210
a member of the Second Division
of the Whitebeard Pirates.

82
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,912
He was one of my own
men, but he committed

83
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,248
the most unforgiveable
sin a pirate could.

84
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,983
He killed one of his
fellow crewmembers,

85
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,584
and then he jumped ship.

86
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,420
As Commander of his division,

87
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:04,657
it's my responsibility
to take care of him.

88
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,101
There's a little something
I wanted you to have.

89
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,135
Here.

90
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:22,241
Do yourself a favor
and hang onto that.

91
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,444
But it's just a scrap of paper.

92
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,579
[ACE] That paper will
reunite us some day.

93
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:31,117
I'd tuck it away somewhere.
For safe keeping.

94
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,785
What ya don't want it?

95
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,287
No, I do.

96
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,990
It's perfectly natural
for a guy to worry...

97
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,927
...about his
bungling kid brother.

98
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,330
He might be a bit much
for all of you to handle...

99
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,600
...but take good
care of him for me.

100
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,536
Wait. You're leaving already?

101
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:57,810
Luffy, when next we meet,
we'll both be top pirates.

102
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,111
[LUFFY chuckles]

103
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,786
And after that, I met him.

104
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,223
Blackbeard, that is.
When I was in Mock Town.

105
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,593
--[LUFFY] Hey, fatso!
--[BLACKBEARD] Hey, barkeep!

106
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,694
[TERRY]
What's wrong?

107
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,195
[LUFFY, BLACKBEARD]
This cherry pie tastes frickin'

108
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,463
--[LUFFY] horrible!
--[BLACKBEARD] delicious!

109
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,498
[BOTH]
Hm?

110
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,634
[BOTH] I'm gonna beat the
living crap out of you!

111
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,002
Do you two even have
the slightest idea

112
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,103
what you're fighting about?

113
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:24,804
[BLACKBEARD]
Heh.

114
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,139
So then, are you a pirate?

115
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,175
Yeah. That's right.

116
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,776
How big's your bounty?

117
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,712
Thirty million.

118
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,615
Thirty million? For you?

119
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,950
I wouldn't believe ya
even if I collected it!

120
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,052
Are you calling me a liar,
you fat, hairy ape?

121
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,187
[ZORO]
Enough!

122
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,991
[CUSTOMER G] No way! The kid
just challenged Bellamy!

123
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,958
[CUSTOMER H laughing]

124
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,193
[CUSTOMER I]
He'll be slaughtered!

125
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,828
Luffy, hold on!

126
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,030
Mister, we're trying to
get to the sky island.

127
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,999
Do you know anything about that?

128
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,033
[BELLAMY]
Huh?

129
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:01,674
[CUSTOMERS laughing]

130
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:07,413
[CUSTOMER H] Did she say
what I think she said?

131
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,415
[CUSTOMER I]
Sky Island? What an idiot!

132
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,684
[BELLAMY chuckling]

133
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,319
You got me there, kid.

134
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,021
I can't believe you
guys are putting hope

135
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,190
into such a ridiculous legend
like an island in the sky.

136
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,525
[BELLAMY laughing]

137
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,528
'Specially considering
how little you know!

138
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:27,366
Thing is, the time of
pirate's dreams are over!

139
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,369
So when I see people
chasing dreams of One Piece,

140
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,072
I get disgusted!

141
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,007
[NAMI]
Luffy!

142
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,242
[LUFFY]
Zoro.

143
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,414
No matter what happens,
don't fight back.

144
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:51,757
[CUSTOMERS jeering]

145
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,433
[BLACKBEARD]
The sky island does exist.

146
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,072
Got something you wanna say?

147
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,808
This new era they keep
rambling on and on about

148
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:11,077
is a load of crap.

149
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,081
The era when pirates dream of
treasure will come to an end?

150
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,282
Yeah right!

151
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,619
[laughing]

152
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:30,029
The dreams of pirates...
will never end!

153
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,466
Am I right?

154
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,104
It's crazy, but back then,

155
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,439
I didn't know he was the
guy Ace was looking for,

156
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,775
or what he'd end
up doing to him.

157
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,314
What?

158
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,449
The Warlords are teaming
up with the Marines?

159
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,785
And they're gonna have a war
with Whitebeard and his crew?

160
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,621
W-When? How?

161
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,124
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second!

162
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,727
This-This is way too much
for me to take in all at once.

163
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,999
What a foolish man you are.

164
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,969
You don't knyow
anything, do you?

165
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,806
Now listen. That was only
conjecture at this point.

166
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,341
I don't have any proof,

167
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:19,545
but I'd say that battle
is a high probability.

168
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,648
The World Government
has laid out their bait.

169
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,651
But Captain Whitebeard would
never, ever allow his mates

170
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,652
to be killed.

171
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,521
But even with that knowledge,

172
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:32,191
they have announced the public
execution of Portgas D. Ace,

173
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:35,728
a powerful and high-ranking
Commander in his crew.

174
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,366
What's wrong?

175
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,369
They're gonna execute...

176
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,076
According to this,
a pirate named Blackbeard

177
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,012
defeated Ace and gave him
up to the World Government.

178
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,015
In return, they invited
him to be a Warlord.

179
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,219
Ace is my brother.

180
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,221
Portgas D. Ace, the "Fire Fist."

181
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,090
You're talking about my brother!

182
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,858
Huh?

183
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,992
What?

184
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,129
I have to go rescue Ace,
no matter what it takes!

185
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,598
I could hardly believe it

186
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,367
when I heard the news
about Ace, myself.

187
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,535
I see.

188
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,538
So in Mock Town, you met
Teach without ever knowing

189
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,841
that he was your
brother's enemy, huh?

190
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,511
Then it wasn't until Impel Down
that you learned the truth.

191
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,379
[LUFFY]
Blackbeard.

192
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,248
I see.

193
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,723
So you're... Blackbeard.

194
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,824
[BLACKBEARD]
Huh?

195
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,027
Oh right, I guess I never
gave you my name, did I?

196
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,363
[laughing]

197
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,700
Long time no see,
Straw Hat Luffy.

198
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,268
Hey, I know how you feel.

199
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,137
I was surprised
myself when I heard

200
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,639
you were my old
Commander's baby brother.

201
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:57,276
What're ya doin' down here?
You're gonna miss the big show.

202
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,579
Don't ya wanna be there for
your brother's public execution?

203
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,449
[BLACKBEARD laughing]

204
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,255
And this washed-up
former Warlord over here.

205
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,323
Yeah, I mean you, Crocodile.

206
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,092
I heard ya got your
ass handed to you,

207
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,762
but I didn't know Straw Hat
Luffy was the one to do it.

208
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,932
[BLACKBEARD]
Funny thing is,

209
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,502
I was trying to take Crocodile's
place as a Warlord at that time,

210
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,905
so killing you was about
the best way I could think of

211
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,941
to show the government
I was worthy of the position.

212
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,343
And yet here you are.

213
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,446
Fate decided to
save you, instead.

214
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,448
Better make sure you pay
your humble respects

215
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,018
at his grave, Straw Hat.

216
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,320
He went and took
your place for you.

217
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,789
'Cause if it weren't
for your brother,

218
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,992
you'd be dead, and
he'd be walkin' free.

219
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,630
I knew the pirate
that Blackbeard killed.

220
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,432
He was the Commander
of the Fourth Division

221
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,034
of the Whitebeard Pirates.

222
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,869
Went by the name of Thatch.

223
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:00,039
He was a loyal friend
and good-hearted.

224
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,474
Captain Whitebeard and
I go back a long ways,

225
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,810
and I owe the old
salt a great debt.

226
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,947
So I would often visit
his ship back then.

227
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,318
But I didn't notice what Teach
was up to until it was too late.

228
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:17,389
And it was then that Ace sailed
out alone after Blackbeard.

229
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,325
As the Commander of
the Second Division

230
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,327
of the Whitebeard Pirates,

231
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,197
it was his job to punish
Teach for his crime.

232
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,723
[MARINE A]
Attention, all soldiers!

233
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,225
Report to the gulf!

234
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:58,163
Prepare for the public
execution of Portgas D. Ace!

235
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:03,702
I repeat! Attention, all
soldiers! Report to the gulf!

236
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,026
[BLACKBEARD] We'd better cut
them off before they leave,

237
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,428
or before the Navy
gets to 'em first.

238
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,298
[ACE] Hey, hold on a
second there, Teach.

239
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,899
We need to talk.

240
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,934
[BLACKBEARD]
Huh?

241
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,078
Oh!

242
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,581
What d'you know!
It's Commander Ace.

243
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,251
[ACE] You have no right
to call me that anymore.

244
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,888
Use that title with respect,
don't use it at all.

245
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,856
I won't have you mock me.

246
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,301
Fine, have it your way.

247
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,770
But there's one question
I'd like to ask, first.

248
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:16,342
Instead of fighting, why don't
you become a member of my crew?

249
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,179
I have the perfect plan
to rise to the top.

250
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,315
If you stick with me, I swear
we can rule the world!

251
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,851
Whitebeard's days are
numbered, and you know it.

252
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,187
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates!

253
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,457
First, I'm headed off to
Water 7 to kill Straw Hat Luffy

254
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,026
as a special gift to
the World Government.

255
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,795
Wouldn't hurt to have
you along for the fun!

256
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,797
Luffy, huh?

257
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,432
You're out of your mind.

258
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,302
[BLACKBEARD]
Oh? You know him?

259
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,205
[ACE] Of course I know
him, you sack of crap.

260
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,340
I'm not gonna let you
kill my little brother.

261
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,875
[BLACKBEARD]
Uh...

262
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,444
And I'm not joining your crew.

263
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,014
You can take your little
offer and shove it up your--

264
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,817
Well, you get it.

265
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,852
[BLACKBEARD]
Tch.

266
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,993
[ACE]
Fire Fist!

267
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,561
[ALL yell]

268
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:16,168
[screaming]

269
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:34,019
[BLACKBEARD laughing]

270
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,057
[BLACKBEARD]
All right, Ace.

271
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,059
You wanna finish me, don't you?

272
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:44,196
The murder of a fellow crewmate
is a serious crime, after all.

273
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,330
And yes, I killed

274
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,100
Fourth Division Commander
Thatch with my own hands!

275
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,202
You know the rules!
On Whitebeard's ship,

276
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,271
whoever finds one of
those gets to eat it.

277
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,273
I memorized the
shapes and colors

278
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,675
of all the Devil Fruits
that they've discovered,

279
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,445
so I knew that was
the one I needed.

280
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,583
Then you murdered him in
cold blood and stole it.

281
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,418
Without a second thought.

282
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,888
Bad luck for him.

283
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:14,693
There's no other way.
This ability has chosen me.

284
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,895
[laughing]

285
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:21,066
And its power has made me
the strongest man in the world!

286
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,301
Watch.

287
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,637
Even among the Logia Fruits,
there's nothing quite like it!

288
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,112
[BLACKBEARD] Ace, your body
is made of fire, right?

289
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,218
[laughing]

290
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:43,655
My body is darkness.

291
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:47,059
Firefly Fiery Doll!

292
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,328
[screaming]

293
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,831
[BLACKBEARD]
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

294
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,767
[screaming]

295
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,436
I wonder what's going on here.

296
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,605
If you're a Logia-type,
that shouldn't hurt you.

297
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,107
Or rather, it shouldn't
even hit you.

298
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,776
[BLACKBEARD]
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

299
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,786
I already told you.

300
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,156
My darkness swallows
everything around it.

301
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,459
Whether it's punches, blades,
bullets, lightning, or fire.

302
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,761
Unlike you, I can't just
turn into an element

303
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,129
and dodge an attack.

304
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,832
And the pain I absorb when
I get hit is much greater

305
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,034
than what a normal human feels.

306
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,538
But the tradeoff for
that inconvenience

307
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,306
is more than worth it.

308
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,276
'Cause there happens to be
one other thing I can absorb.

309
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,911
Black Vortex!

310
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,514
[BLACKBEARD] First, I use
the gravity of darkness

311
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:46,018
to pull a Devil Fruit power
holder into my grasp.

312
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,722
[ACE]
Too... strong.

313
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,196
[BLACKBEARD]
And then, when I touch them...

314
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,334
[chuckles]

315
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:07,606
You're smart. Have you figured
out the secret yet? Huh?

316
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,409
It can't be.

317
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:25,190
[BLACKBEARD laughing]

318
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,269
It's been so long
since you've been hit,

319
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:41,707
I bet you forgot how
much it hurts, Ace.

320
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,542
But you understand now.

321
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,245
You understood the
second I grabbed you.

322
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,414
Not only can my
darkness pull you in,

323
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:54,052
it can also absorb your
Devil Fruit power.

324
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,222
In other words, as long as
they're in contact with me,

325
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,691
someone with Devil Fruit
powers is no different

326
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,026
than a normal human.

327
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,795
Logia. Zoan. Paramythia.

328
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,731
All those with
Devil Fruit powers

329
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,600
who have become dependent on
them are in for a surprise.

330
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,237
One little touch will remind
them how weak they really are!

331
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,074
Then all I have
to do is avoid you.

332
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,243
[BLACKBEARD]
Black Vortex!

333
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,848
[ACE]
St. Elmo's Fire!

334
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,266
Everything falls
before darkness.

335
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,303
Even you can only
struggle for so long.

336
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:48,840
Still, finishing you off here
would be a waste of your talent.

337
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,210
Don't fight it, Ace. Join me!

338
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,416
[ACE]
Hmph.

339
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,518
If I surrendered to you,

340
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:03,088
then I could never call
myself a man again.

341
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,792
I won't submit, I won't live
with regrets, no matter what.

342
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,160
You got that, stupid?

343
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,795
[growls]

344
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,798
Once you die, your
morals are useless.

345
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,934
I'm sorry you can't
understand that, Ace.

346
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,103
Darkness take you!

347
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,539
[ACE]
Great Flame Commandment!

348
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,182
[ACE]
Flame Emperor!

349
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,220
[laughing]

350
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,222
The sun against darkness, huh?

351
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,024
Only one can win!

352
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:43,028
I'll make Whitebeard
the King or die trying.

353
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:47,499
[TEACH yelling]

354
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:52,537
[ACE yelling]

355
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,166
[NARRATOR] Three hours
before Ace's execution,

356
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,402
the Warlords take their
place at Navy Headquarters

357
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,737
waiting for Whitebeard
to make his move.

358
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,672
With the three Admirals
on the scene,

359
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,541
tensions flare before
what is sure to be

360
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,111
a desperate struggle for
pirates and Marines alike.

361
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,880
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

362
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,883
"A Special Retrospective
Before Marineford!

363
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,385
The Three Navy Admirals
Come Together!"

364
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,788
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates!
