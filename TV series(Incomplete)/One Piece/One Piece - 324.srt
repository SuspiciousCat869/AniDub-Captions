[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:40,360
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,530
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:48,702
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,405
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,572
You can have it!

7
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:55,976
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,178
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,548
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,618
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,288
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,527
[USOPP] I'm sorry!

13
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,265
I'm too stubborn, I know!

14
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:22,402
I take back every word I said!

15
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,043
Luffy...

16
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:34,414
Hurry up! Grab on already!

Poor Luffy!

23
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,157
His ship's brand new, too!

24
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,725
I guess you could
call this "tough love",

25
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,527
but it really just looks
like he's trying to kill him.

26
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,567
[MAN 324A] You can do it!
Show the Navy who's boss!

They're done for!

They're criminals--
Don't cheer so loud!

00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:34,708
Come on, Straw Hat,
don't give up now!

30
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,809
Keep moving!

What the heck do they
think they're doing?

35
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,594
Why are they
furling their sails?

36
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,932
They're not giving up, are they?

37
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,099
[GARP] Not on your life!

00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,901

00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:03,003
I don't know what
that fool is up to,

00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,872
but my grandson's no quitter,
I'll tell you that.

41
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,041
Hurry up!

42
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,408
I said furl the sails!

43
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:11,344
Yeah!
He said furl the sails!

44
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,779
[ZORO]
You sure about this, Franky?

45
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,381
Doesn't seem very smart to me.

46
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,149
I got this!

00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,117
Don't ask questions, just do it!

second ago, you were crying

00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,062
and now you're--
Nope, never mind. Whatever.

52
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,797
Why don't you
shut up and help me?

53
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,266
[SANJI] Could you hurry it up?

54
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,701
We can all agree
that Zoro's stupid,

55
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,704
but right now we've got
cannonballs flying at us!

56
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:40,908
All right, Franky.

57
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,676
I don't get it,
but I furled all the sails.

58
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,479
Now do whatever you're gonna do
before the Navy blows us up.

59
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,380
There's something
you're forgetting.

60
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,184
[FRANKY] Don't you know?

61
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,052
We can't leave until
we give this ship a name.

62
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,087
[SANJI] A name?
At a time like this?

63
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,188
[FRANKY] Of course!

64
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,423
This is her maiden voyage,

65
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,392
so there's no point
if we don't do it now!

66
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,626
Well, I guess.

67
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,166
Whatever it is, it's gotta
have "lion" in it, right?

68
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,266
[LUFFY] Wait, I got it!

69
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,002
I just thought
of the perfect name!

70
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,337
The Black Bear
Polar Bear Lion Tiger!

71
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,972
[USOPP] That's a
horrible name for a ship!

72
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,174
No way!

73
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,142
Then how about the
Super Wolf Gorilla Bear?

74
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,309
You're just naming off animals.

75
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,911
Can't you pick one
and work from there?

76
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,780
The Squid Octopus Chimpanzee!

77
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,181
[USOPP]
What happened to the lion?

78
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,284
Uh-huh. Well, I did have
a lion in mind for the design...

79
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:27,320
Though the guys at Galley-La
didn't seem to get that.

80
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,389
[PAULIE]
That figurehead's nice, huh?

81
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,524
[TILESTONE]
Yeah! I love sunflowers.

82
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,928
It's not a sunflower,
you morons!

83
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:35,362
Well, don't take it so hard.

84
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,364
You can't expect that
everyone is going to see it

85
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,331
for what it is.

86
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,733
But this is the
ship the future

87
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,368
King of the Pirates will ride.

88
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,970
That's what you were
thinking when you built it,

89
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:43,871
right, Franky?

90
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,172
Damn straight.

91
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,740
The oceans in the New World
may have monsters,

92
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,876
but this is the King of Beasts
that'll reign over them all.

93
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,145
[ICEBERG]
A splendid sun, indeed.

94
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,980
It's not the sun, you moron!

95
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,748
A ship as bright as the sun,

96
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:58,085
sailing with a shining smile
as it soars over the dangers

97
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,820
of a thousand seas.

98
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,388
It needs a name
to match that feeling.

99
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,757
I told you, it's not
the sun, Ice-for-brains!

100
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,793
It might not be my place,
but I have a suggestion.

101
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,697
[ICEBERG] Why don't
you call this ship...

102
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,108
[ICEBERG]
...The Thousand Sunny!

103
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:21,942
Ooh, I like it!

104
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,477
Me too! It's super cool!

105
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,614
I was thinking "Dandelion
Lion Dandy Unbearable Bear,"

106
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:27,848
but this is way better!

107
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:29,116
Just stop!

108
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,151
I kind of wanted
"Big Boss Lionel",

109
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:33,320
but Thousand Sunny
is pretty good, too.

110
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:35,923
I was going to suggest
"Creature of Darkness".

111
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,158
I like "Monsieur
Sunflower," personally.

112
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,828
Have all of you
lost your minds?

113
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,629
[ROBIN] A ship to sail
a thousand seas

114
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,131
with a sunny smile.

115
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,067
It's perfect, don't you think?

116
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,768
[FRANKY] Don't get
too excited, you guys.

117
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,135
That was just a warm-up!

118
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,872
I've got a name that's
gonna knock your socks off!

119
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,907
This ship will now
be known as--

120
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,309
--I like Ice Pop's idea
--The New Battle Franky

121
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,643
--just fine. Let's go with that
--Lion Gang Champion!

122
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:57,844
--and get this ship sailing!
--What do you think?

123
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,312
--Sounds good.
--Come on, guys!

124
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,180
--The Thousand Sunny it is!
--Lion Gang Champion, right?

125
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,015
--I agree!
--I agree!

126
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,416
Nice to meet you, Sunny!

127
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,051
I thought we'd have a
harder time agreeing on this,

128
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,619
but I guess it worked out fine.

129
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,020
So it did.

130
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:11,558
[SANJI] Hey, Franky,
stop pouting and get moving!

131
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:14,694
Use this secret weapon of yours
so we can get out of here!

132
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,162
Better make it fast, too.

133
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,032
The Navy's gonna
catch up any second.

134
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,833
[FRANKY] Yeah, yeah, I know.

135
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,501
Take one last look at Water 7,

136
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,770
cause it's gonna be out
of sight before you know it.

137
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:27,808
I'm warning you, once we start
moving, we'll really be moving.

138
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:28,976
Okay, got it.

139
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,243
One sec.

140
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,717
[LUFFY] Grandpa!

141
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,020
[GARP] Hm?

142
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:42,389
[LUFFY] Oh, and if
you're there, Coby and...

143
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,824
Uh...

144
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,327
[LUFFY] The other guy--
It was nice to see you again!

145
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,497
[HELMEPPO] You forgot
my name again, didn't you?

146
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,398
[GARP] What're you
yapping about, Luffy?

147
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,700
I got plenty more cannonballs!

148
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,803
[GARP]
Meteor...

149
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,170
...Fist!

150
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:05,479
Give it up!

151
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:06,813
[GARP] Hm?

152
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,081
I don't know
what's gonna happen,

153
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,917
but we're gonna get away!

154
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,186
Well, I hope to see
you guys again someday!

155
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,156
Wow, Luffy--
That was super cool!

156
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:16,490
[GARP] You little turd!

157
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:19,393
You show your Grandpa
some respect, you hear me?

158
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,694
How dare you!

159
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,030
[HELMEPPO] I know he's annoying,
Vice Admiral, but calm down!

160
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,799
Thanks for helping us
name the ship, Ice Pops!

161
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,334
You're awesome!

162
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:30,070
And thanks to
everybody else, too!

163
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:33,707
Bye, Monster Granny!
Bye, Galley-La!

164
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,042
We had a great time!

165
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,877
I think he's saying something.

166
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,746
[chuckling]

167
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,614
I can't hear a darned thing.

168
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,816
It seems that pirates
can't even go out to sea

169
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,418
without causing a giant ruckus.

170
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:45,486
[YOKOZUNA] Gero!

171
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,887
Here we go!

172
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,488
Combining the power
of our air cannon

173
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:50,557
with the durability
of the Adam wood,

174
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,526
I've made an emergency
acceleration device!

175
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,668
[COBY] He's brought out
the ball and chain!

176
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,172
[GARP] Luffy...

177
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,179
Hm? What the heck
is that thing?

178
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,581
[USOPP] We can't dodge that!

179
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:14,982
We're all gonna die!
We're all gonna die!

180
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:16,550
We're all gonna die!

181
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:17,851
[CHOPPER screaming]

182
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,253
I'll pound some
manners into you!

183
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,558
Luffy, run away!

184
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,894
He's serious this time!

185
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,863
Franky! Go!

186
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:30,664
[whistling]

187
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,599
[GARP] Here it comes!

188
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,643
[USOPP, CHOPPER, SANJI]
We're all gonna die!

189
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:46,313
[FRANKY] Coup de Burst!

190
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,495
Did their ship
take off and fly away?

191
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,773
Not bad, kiddo.

192
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,115
[ALL ooh-ing]

193
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,183
--Awesome!
--Awesome!

194
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:24,518
I can't believe it--

195
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,153
I never thought I'd feel
this again, but here I am!

196
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,292
[USOPP] Merry...

197
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,428
[FRANKY] It eats up
three barrels of cola,

198
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:36,363
but it can fly for
a whole kilometer.

199
00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:38,599
I'm not trying to brag
here, but simply put,

200
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:42,069
anything the Going Merry could
do, this ship can do better.

201
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,037
And it's got tricks of its own.

202
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,572
[FRANKY]
But even if it's all new,

203
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:49,510
I hope the brave spirit of the
Merry can live on in the Sunny.

204
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,479
[FRANKY] If anything breaks,
I'll fix it up as good as new!

205
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:55,616
From weapons to furniture,
I know this ship up and down!

206
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,719
It may be my masterpiece,
but it's all yours now!

207
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,155
[ALL]
Yeah!

208
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,234
[GARP] I'll be damned.

209
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,670
They got away after all.

210
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,841
[laughing]

211
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,343
[GARP]
That's my grandson for ya!

212
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:26,479
[GARP laughing]

213
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:36,924
It's kind of a shame.

214
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,625
I wish the little guy
had stayed with us!

215
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:39,960
Yeah, I'm gonna miss him.

216
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:43,164
But wherever he goes, he still
wants to come to Elbaf someday.

217
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:45,132
And we'll be there
waiting when he does!

218
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,466
[KASHII] Sounds like fun!

219
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,001
[OIMO] We got a couple
hundred years left on us,

220
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,337
so we can afford to be patient!

221
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,640
Nothing like a job well done!

222
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:54,041
Yeah, you said it.

223
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,609
Let's see what they
need at the workshop.

224
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:57,745
[TILESTONE] We've still
got repair work to do, too!

225
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,112
[PAULIE] Bring it on!

226
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,985
Better head back
to the station.

227
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,120
Gonna be business as usual soon!

228
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,689
[ZAMBAI] Huh... Let's see.

229
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,524
How did Big Bro do this stuff?

230
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:11,792
[KIWI] Beats me.

231
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,027
[FRANKY BEARDFACE]
Yeah, this is bad.

232
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,496
I always just did
what he told me to do.

233
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,731
[FRANKY SILVERHAIR] Guess we're
gonna starve to death, huh?

234
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,065
[ZAMBAI] Iceberg!

235
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,234
I had a feeling
something like this

236
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,935
would happen to you riff-raff.

237
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,137
[ZAMBAI] What?

238
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,505
Did you come here
just to make fun of us?

239
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,840
[ICEBERG] No, I came
to offer you a job.

240
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,108
If you need work,

241
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:29,409
then you should stop by
the Galley-La Offices.

242
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:32,079
[ZAMBAI] Do you really
mean it Iceb--Icebro?

243
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,847
No! Big Bro!

244
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,782
[FRANKY FAMILY] Our new Big Bro!

245
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,317
[ICEBERG] Stop that.

246
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:01,241
[MARINE 324B] Commodore Smoker!
Excellent work!

247
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,745
You said that pirate
had a 50 million bounty?

248
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:05,512
[MARINE 324B] Yes, sir.

249
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:06,547
[SMOKER] Pathetic!

250
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,382
The Navy's standards
are dropping these days.

251
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,551
[One disappointment
after another.

252
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:12,853
Excuse me, Smoker?

253
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,288
Ensign Tashigi!

254
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,590
Did you see the
Straw Hats' wanted posters?

255
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:17,624
They all have bounties.

256
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,360
[SMOKER] Who do you
think you're talking to?

257
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,062
Oh, you're not Smoker... Oops!

258
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,364
[SMOKER]
Wear your glasses, stupid!

259
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:31,171
[SMOKER] The Navy
will always be the Navy.

260
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,340
And as long as we're
a part of the military,

261
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,210
there's a limit to what we
can accomplish on our own.

262
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,778
[SMOKER] In other words,
what we need is a higher rank.

263
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,547
After that incident
at Enies Lobby,

264
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:42,783
pirates from all over
the world will be looking up

265
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:45,486
to Straw Hat and his crew.

266
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,586
I see.

267
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,624
I'm putting my pride
on the line here.

268
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,727
I swear I will crush
them in the New World!

269
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,067
[ZEFF] Hm...

270
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,803
Enies Lobby is the gateway
to the World Government.

271
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,271
Once you've gone
knocking on that door,

272
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,407
I'm afraid there's
no turning back.

273
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,042
[ZEFF] You can bet your life
that pirates and Marines alike

274
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,411
have got their blood
boiling over this mess.

275
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:13,247
It won't be long before
everyone in the world

276
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,183
will know the names
of the Straw Hat Pirates.

277
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,552
[ZEFF] Their faces,
on the other hand...

278
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,121
[raucous laughter]

279
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,256
[PATTY]
Lookin' good there, Sanji!

280
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,192
[CARNE]
Attention customers!

281
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,027
This is one of our former chefs!

282
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,161
[PATTY] I hope you
enjoy your stay at

283
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,264
the Maritime
Restaurant Baratie,

284
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,098
former home of Black Leg Sanji,

285
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:35,102
the infamous cook with a
77 million Berry bounty!

286
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,170
It looks just like him, I swear!

287
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,606
[MAN 324C] I propose a toast!

288
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,442
Raise your glasses!

289
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:43,811
[MAN 324D] For the biggest
name in all of East Blue,

290
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:45,412
with a bounty of 300 million.

291
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:49,083
[MEN] To our friend Luffy!
Cheers!

292
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:52,819
[PATRONS cheering, laughing]

293
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,056
Quiet down,
the whole lot of you!

294
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:56,957
Have you fools no shame?

295
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:58,592
To Luffy!

296
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,260
That's enough!

297
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,395
It's useless.

298
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,398
No one listens to what
the mayor says anymore.

299
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:07,901
What a cute pet!

300
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,437
Luffy must be having
so much fun out there!

301
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,739
And it looks like he's made
some wonderful friends as well!

302
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,742
You call those thugs friends?
They're criminals!

303
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,914
Our town gave birth
to a wanted criminal

304
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:23,150
that turned against
the whole world!

305
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,952
And what kind of
pirate is crazy enough

306
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,921
to declare war on
the darned Government?

307
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:28,122
That's a good question!

308
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,657
[MAYOR] Garp needs
to clean up this mess!

309
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,025
If he hadn't left his
grandson here on this island,

310
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,660
none of this would've happened!

311
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:36,263
That family's been crazy
for three generations!

312
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,698
I wonder if Dadan
knows about all this.

313
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:39,967
To Luffy!

314
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,335
I said "quiet down", didn't I?

315
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,609
[KAYA] Sniper King,
the king of the snipers.

316
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:50,777
You're right!
There's no doubt about it!

317
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,745
That's Usopp!

318
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:52,980
[PEPPER] I told you!

319
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,381
[ONION] He's got the
Captain's nose, right?

320
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:55,516
[KAYA]
Mm-hmm.

321
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,651
All the people in the
village didn't believe us!

322
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,252
[CARROT] He's worth 30 million!

323
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,688
Even if no one else could,
we knew you'd recognize him!

324
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:03,090
[CARROT] Now everyone
in the world can know

325
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,591
how awesome he is!

326
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,660
[ONION] The Captain has the
power to make lies the truth!

327
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,628
All you gotta do is believe!

328
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:10,931
Dunno where he got it,
but that mask is cool!

329
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,467
Let's see if we can make
our own out of clay.

330
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,335
Hey Kaya,
where are you going?

331
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:19,106
I should get back to my
medical studies, that's all.

332
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,475
I have to become a good
doctor as soon as I can!

333
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,344
That way, if Usopp
comes back here injured

334
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,680
after all his adventures, I know
I'll be able to fix him up.

335
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:30,884
[PEPPER] Man, the Captain
sure is lucky, huh?

336
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:33,520
[CARROT] But I'm gonna beat him
up if he ever makes Kaya sad.

337
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,121
[ONION] Me, too.

338
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,222
[YOUNG SWORDSMAN 324A]
Master!

339
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,324
Is it true that
Pirate Hunter Zoro

340
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:39,293
used to study
at this school, too?

341
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,061
[KOSHIRO]
Why yes, that is true.

342
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:43,597
But I don't want you to
see him as a role model.

343
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,364
You understand?

344
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,734
Aww! Why not?
He's so awesome!

345
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:49,569
Teach us to be pirates, too,
so we can be strong like him!

346
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,938
I didn't teach him or
anyone else to be a pirate!

347
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:52,873
[YOUNG SWORDSMAN 324A]
I don't believe that!

348
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,474
Are you lying to us, Master?

349
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:57,377
[KOSHIRO] You never can tell
quite how they'll turn out.

350
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,145
[KOSHIRO] I was surprised
to hear about what happened

351
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,982
on Enies Lobby, but I'm sure
there isn't a speck of doubt

352
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,650
in your heart, right, Zoro?

353
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,719
No matter what kind
of person you become,

354
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:08,755
all I want is for you to cherish
your own way of the sword.

355
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:12,626
[NOJIKO] Hey, Genzo!

356
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,029
I brought some tangerines!

357
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:16,363
[GENZO] Again, Nojiko?

358
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,932
I keep telling you,
I can buy them in the store!

359
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,667
No need to be
uptight about it--

360
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,902
Just take them!

361
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:23,904
Besides, you're like a
father to me and Nami--

362
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:25,539
I wouldn't dream
of charging you!

363
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,174
If you insist.

364
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,475
[NOJIKO] What are you up to?

365
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,310
Hm? Oh, uh--

366
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:32,579
I've been trying to file a
complaint to Navy Headquarters

367
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,082
with the Transponder Snail,
but they won't pick up the line.

368
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:37,685
A complaint? To the Navy?

369
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:39,186
[GENZO] That's right!

370
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,720
Do they really think
they can distribute

371
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:43,357
such an explicit wanted
poster all over the world?

372
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,292
At this rate, she'll have
more marriage suitors

373
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,194
than bounty hunters after her!

374
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,329
[NOJIKO] Well, you seem to
like the picture at least,

375
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,565
seeing as you blew it up so big.

376
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,468
I wouldn't let it get to you.

377
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,603
After all, at least you
know they kept their promise.

378
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,005
[GENZO] I know Nami's
going away with you,

379
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,376
but if any of you ever
do anything to hurt her,

380
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,145
I will kill you.

381
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:06,580
[NOJIKO] That smile
is all the proof we need.

382
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,015
[GENZO] Well, I suppose so.

383
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,083
But I'd rather she
stop being a pirate.

384
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:11,084
[NOJIKO]
Oh, yeah?

385
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:12,553
You want to take
that smile away?

386
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:13,320
[GENZO] Of course not!

387
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,422
That's not what I meant at all!

388
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:32,072
Doctor Kureha.

389
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,842
Dalton, what did you
call me down here for, huh?

390
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,943
I'm a very busy woman, you know.

391
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:38,612
Well, I'm sorry
to trouble you,

392
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:40,581
but when you see these,
I think you'll understand.

393
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:43,150
[KUREHA] Not gonna ask me the
secret to my eternal youth?

394
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,153
Oh, and by the way, Dalton,
since you're the king and all,

395
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,022
don't you think you
should live in the castle?

396
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:49,390
I'll rent a room out to you.

397
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,091
I've stayed in this
village for so long

398
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:52,659
that I think I prefer it here.

399
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,595
I also prefer to have
chestnuts with my rice.

400
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:58,632
Well, if it isn't
the Straw Hat kid

401
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,901
and all his little friends.

402
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,302
Their new wanted
posters showed up

403
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:04,437
after that incident
at Enies Lobby.

404
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:07,407
[KUREHA]
Chopper?

405
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:09,543
[DALTON] I'm sure the amount
is some sort of mistake.

406
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:11,545
Seeing his face again

407
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,714
is worth all the
Berries in the world.

408
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:15,216
[KUREHA] That's good.

409
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:18,552
As long as he's happy,
that's all I need.

410
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:25,492
[IGARAM]
Unbelievable! Nico Robin?

411
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:29,596
What in the world is Miss All
Sunday doing on Luffy's crew?

412
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,099
I knew there was something
mysterious about that woman,

413
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:34,134
but this is quite the shock!

414
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:35,669
If this news
reaches Princess Vivi,

415
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:39,206
I can only imagine how
disheartened she would be.

416
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,641
é/\Oh, don't worry,
I already heard about that.

417
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:42,676
It's no big deal, though.

418
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,044
It's not a big deal?

419
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,314
I thought you, of all people,
would be shocked!

420
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,416
Even when you're as
close to Luffy as I was,

421
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,651
you can never quite
tell what he's thinking.

422
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,888
[VIVI] Whether I understand
his reasoning or not,

423
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,558
I still believe
in everything he does.

424
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,026
Because I know
that he's going to be

425
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,828
King of the Pirates one day.

426
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:04,131
[VIVI] The best we can do
is respect his decisions.

427
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:05,632
[IGARAM] How forgiving!

428
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:09,937
You've turned into such a fine
young lady, Princess Vivi!

429
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,339
[VIVI] Hey, it's
nothing to cry about.

430
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,710
[REVOLUTIONARY 324B] Our forces
have triumphed in Centaurea!

431
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:18,011
We did it!

432
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,215
[DRAGON]
Another kingdom has fallen.

433
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:22,449
We're on a roll, huh?

434
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,518
We had a big victory
in the North Blue, too!

435
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:25,385
[DRAGON] This is war.

436
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,221
Even in victory,
we must be humble.

437
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:29,456
Uh, of course, sir. I'm sorry.

438
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:34,461
[DRAGON] What is this?

439
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:35,795
[REVOLUTIONARY 324B]
Huh? The posters?

440
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:37,331
They're for the
Straw Hat Pirates.

441
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:40,300
They're the ones who took out
Crocodile in Alabasta.

442
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:43,236
They recently caused a big
incident at Enies Lobby, too.

443
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,473
The Government can't afford
to ignore them anymore.

444
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,709
After their recent actions,
their total bounty jumped

445
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:52,313
to six hundred sixty-six
million and fifty Berries.

446
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:55,149
Also, their Captain is
Vice Admiral Garp's grandson.

447
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:56,884
Ah--Is something wrong?

448
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:59,286
[DRAGON] I'm going
to get some fresh air.

449
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:05,459
[DRAGON] Follow your own
beliefs to the end, Luffy.

450
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:07,761
With a will such as yours
and a little luck,

451
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:11,264
the masses may learn to
question this world after all.

452
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:16,136
Ride the winds
of change, my son.

453
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,173
That day you and I meet will
come soon enough, I'm sure.

454
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:30,116
[LUFFY] All right, guys!

455
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:33,721
Are you ready?

456
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:34,855
[ALL] Yeah!

457
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:36,757
Then everybody raise a glass

458
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,060
for the return of our old
friends Robin and Usopp,

459
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:42,563
as well as our new
crewmember Franky,

460
00:22:42,596 --> 00:22:45,833
and the best ship ever,
the Thousand Sunny!

461
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,901
Let's hear it for our crew!

462
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,502
[ALL] Cheers!

463
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,113
[LUFFY] Let's go!

464
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:02,650
Next stop, Fishman Island!

465
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:04,584
[ALL] Yeah!

466
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:15,062
[ACE] Let's stop beating
around the bush now, shall we?

467
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:16,731
There's only one reason
for me to be here,

468
00:23:16,764 --> 00:23:18,131
and you know what it is.

469
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,734
[TEACH] Don't be a fool, Ace!

470
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:21,368
You can't beat me now.

471
00:23:21,402 --> 00:23:23,503
[TEACH] Because I finally
have true power--

472
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:27,007
Power to match the ambition
I've held for so long!

473
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,809
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

474
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:30,277
The Most Heinous Power!

475
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:32,879
Blackbeard's
Darkness Attacks Ace!

476
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,415
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
