WEBVTT

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.118
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.353
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:23.490
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:26.426
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:34.408 --> 00:02:36.911
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:36.944 --> 00:02:39.813
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:45.052
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.085 --> 00:02:47.221
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:47.254 --> 00:02:48.589
to ever chart these waters

00:02:48.622 --> 00:02:50.858
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:50.891 --> 00:02:52.760
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:52.793 --> 00:02:55.162
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.196 --> 00:02:57.865
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:02.536
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.104
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.138 --> 00:03:07.808
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:11.946
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.917
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:16.951 --> 00:03:19.720
Luffy and his crew arrive
on the Fishman Island,

00:03:19.753 --> 00:03:23.791
which is located ten thousand
meters below sea level.

00:03:23.824 --> 00:03:24.959
The Fishman Pirates,

00:03:24.992 --> 00:03:28.295
led by Hordy Jones and
assisted by Vander Decken,

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.965
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:30.998 --> 00:03:32.933
It's not long
before the Straw Hats

00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:34.435
get pulled into the conflict.

00:03:34.468 --> 00:03:36.437
Will you just look?

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.372
The Noah's stopped!

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:43.911
The Sea Kings? But why?

00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:45.112
Oh, Luffy!

00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:47.648
You're losing so much
blood from that wound!

00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:49.617
We need to get you to a doctor!

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.955
[panting]

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.190
Yeah, maybe.

00:03:56.223 --> 00:03:59.760
Well, it's okay. Really.

00:03:59.793 --> 00:04:03.831
Just as long as
the ship is stopped.

00:04:03.864 --> 00:04:08.636
I'm just glad
everyone is safe now.

00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:13.974
[LUFFY] "To the Future!
The Path to the Sun!"

00:04:30.324 --> 00:04:32.793
[YELLOW TOOTHY SEA KING]
Princess Shirahoshi.

00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:34.295
You can't imagine how long

00:04:34.328 --> 00:04:38.565
we Sea Kings waited for you
to be born into this world.

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.067
Waited for me?

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.571
This vessel was designed for
us to pull it. Can't you tell?

00:04:44.605 --> 00:04:47.341
This responsibility
has been passed down

00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:49.943
for as long as
anyone can remember.

00:04:49.977 --> 00:04:53.480
[SHIRAHOSHI] Then, is that the
reason why the Noah is so large?

00:04:53.514 --> 00:04:54.782
[WHALE SEA KING]
Yes.

00:04:54.815 --> 00:04:57.918
Our queen appears once
every several centuries,

00:04:57.951 --> 00:04:59.286
though we do not know why

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.757
she always takes the form
of a mermaid. It's strange.

00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:07.027
I wonder.

00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:10.764
But we do know that
ever since you were born...

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:15.636
...you have been
our exalted queen.

00:05:16.737 --> 00:05:18.072
[gasps]

00:05:20.107 --> 00:05:21.408
[MANBOSHI]
Is she...?

00:05:21.442 --> 00:05:22.509
[RYUBOSHI]
Yes.

00:05:22.543 --> 00:05:25.145
I don't understand it,
but I think...

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:28.882
Our sister is speaking
with the Sea Kings.

00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:31.051
Incredible!

00:05:31.085 --> 00:05:32.986
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Guards, please report!

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.955
What made the Noah stop moving?

00:05:34.988 --> 00:05:38.158
Well, uh, you're not
gonna believe this, sir,

00:05:38.192 --> 00:05:40.661
but a bunch of Sea Kings
just showed up out of the blue

00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:41.995
and they took hold of it.

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:45.566
And I'm not sure I understand
what they're saying, sir,

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.868
but I guess they stepped in
because they wanted to stop

00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:50.604
Luffy from smashing
the Noah to pieces!

00:05:50.637 --> 00:05:51.772
For whatever reason,

00:05:51.805 --> 00:05:55.109
that ship must be really
important to them, too.

00:05:55.142 --> 00:05:56.877
Your Majesty.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.852
[NEPTUNE] Sea Kings.
So it's finally awakened--

00:06:04.885 --> 00:06:10.357
the power that can
destroy this entire world.

00:06:10.391 --> 00:06:11.925
Look.

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:15.729
The bubble's being absorbed
by the island bit by bit!

00:06:15.763 --> 00:06:18.966
[AQUA BEARDED SEA KING] He
won't survive in the deep sea.

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:20.868
[SEA KING A]
Quickly, Shirahoshi.

00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:23.003
You must retrieve him.

00:06:24.138 --> 00:06:26.407
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Luffy! No!

00:06:32.646 --> 00:06:35.983
My Brothers, we should capture
the culprits and quickly!

00:06:36.016 --> 00:06:38.285
--Right!
--[MANBOSHI] Let's shake it!

00:06:40.354 --> 00:06:44.358
[FUKABOSHI] Noah. What sort
of secrets are you hiding?

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:53.333
[AQUA BEARDED SEA KING]
If I didn't know better...

00:06:53.367 --> 00:06:54.535
[PUFFY BIRD SEA KING]
Hmm?

00:06:54.568 --> 00:06:56.437
[AQUA BEARDED SEA KING] ...I'd
say that the human wearing

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.673
the hat was able
to hear us as well.

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:02.309
[WHALE SEA KING]
I doubt that.

00:07:02.342 --> 00:07:04.945
[AQUA BEARDED SEA KING]
It has happened before,

00:07:04.978 --> 00:07:07.047
not so long ago.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.483
[PUFFY BIRD SEA KING]
Oh, I remember.

00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:14.822
[GOLD ROGER] Rayleigh, did
you hear that voice just now?

00:07:14.855 --> 00:07:15.856
[RAYLEIGH]
You're crazy.

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.493
There's obviously
nobody down here.

00:07:19.526 --> 00:07:20.694
[GOLD ROGER]
Who's there?

00:07:20.727 --> 00:07:24.431
Why am I hearing strange voices
at the bottom of the sea?

00:07:24.465 --> 00:07:28.035
Show yourself, now!

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.808
[PUFFY BIRD SEA KING]
Quite mysterious.

00:07:34.842 --> 00:07:37.644
[AQUA BEARDED SEA KING]
Quite mysterious indeed.

00:07:41.315 --> 00:07:45.285
[HACHI] Nyuu. I hope
the Straw Hats are okay.

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:47.888
They'll be all right.
They're strong.

00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:49.523
I wouldn't worry about them.

00:07:49.556 --> 00:07:52.926
He's right!
Just trust them, okay?

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.697
Nyu. I don't know.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:57.898
Uh?

00:07:57.931 --> 00:07:59.466
[DEN]
Huh?

00:08:09.476 --> 00:08:11.445
[DEN]
Huh? Sea Kings?

00:08:11.478 --> 00:08:14.248
[HACHI] Nyuu! And
they're pulling the Noah!

00:08:14.281 --> 00:08:18.051
Ahh! Please don't eat me!

00:08:21.688 --> 00:08:24.525
[SEA KING A]
The Noah is crumbling.

00:08:24.558 --> 00:08:27.160
Can it be saved?

00:08:27.194 --> 00:08:30.797
Can it serve its purpose?

00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:32.199
[WHALE SEA KING]
Well.

00:08:32.232 --> 00:08:34.201
[PURPLE SEA KING]
I believe it could be saved

00:08:34.234 --> 00:08:36.169
if we had their help.

00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:40.173
However, this is
a different age.

00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:44.211
[WHALE SEA KING]
Then can it be repaired?

00:08:44.244 --> 00:08:46.980
[PUFFY BIRD SEA KING]
I certainly hope so.

00:08:47.014 --> 00:08:50.651
The appointed time
is approaching.

00:08:54.821 --> 00:08:57.958
[ALL gasping]

00:08:57.991 --> 00:08:59.426
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Minister of the Left, sir!

00:08:59.459 --> 00:09:02.496
We have a report from
inside the Ryugu Palace!

00:09:02.529 --> 00:09:03.697
What's happening?

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.165
[AMMO KNIGHT A] Well, the
good news is, we've located all

00:09:05.198 --> 00:09:06.466
the mermaids who were kidnapped.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.535
It turns out, they're
right here on the premise!

00:09:08.569 --> 00:09:10.137
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Oh, thank goodness!

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.540
Please, tell me
they're all right!

00:09:13.574 --> 00:09:17.411
Yes! They said they're still
feeling a bit disoriented, sir,

00:09:17.444 --> 00:09:20.047
but they do remember what
the culprit looked like!

00:09:21.081 --> 00:09:22.049
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Bad news is,

00:09:22.082 --> 00:09:24.451
the treasure chamber's
been wiped clean!

00:09:24.484 --> 00:09:28.055
They took it all,
down to the last piece!

00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:29.189
It's awful!

00:09:29.222 --> 00:09:31.925
We even lost the
Tamate Box, sir!

00:09:34.394 --> 00:09:35.662
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Your Majesty!

00:09:35.696 --> 00:09:39.466
Someone seems to have robbed
us during the commotion!

00:09:39.499 --> 00:09:42.603
[NEPTUNE] Stolen treasures
do not concern us now.

00:09:42.636 --> 00:09:48.542
Not moments ago, we nearly
lost our entire kingdom.

00:09:48.575 --> 00:09:50.944
[NEPTUNE] The best thing
to do at present is tell

00:09:50.978 --> 00:09:54.181
the citizens that
the mermaids are safe.

00:09:54.214 --> 00:09:55.916
The damage may be done,

00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:59.553
but we still need to clear
the Straw Hats' names.

00:09:59.586 --> 00:10:02.556
We must do the right thing.

00:10:02.589 --> 00:10:03.890
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE R]
We better make tracks!

00:10:03.924 --> 00:10:05.025
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE S]
Run!

00:10:05.058 --> 00:10:06.393
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE A]
There's no way we'll be spared

00:10:06.426 --> 00:10:07.561
if they catch us!

00:10:07.594 --> 00:10:11.565
We're humans! It's not like
this was our fight anyway!

00:10:11.598 --> 00:10:12.933
Going somewhere?

00:10:12.966 --> 00:10:14.067
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE T]
Let us through!

00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:15.268
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES gasp]

00:10:15.302 --> 00:10:17.871
Let's just use our bubbles
to fly over his head.

00:10:17.904 --> 00:10:20.374
Halt! Water Shot!

00:10:20.407 --> 00:10:22.376
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yell]

00:10:22.409 --> 00:10:25.646
I won't hesitate to shoot you
if you try to get away.

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:26.980
Am I clear?

00:10:27.014 --> 00:10:28.248
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES gasping]

00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:29.616
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Never mind!

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.652
They're gonna kill us,
Boss Jimbei! Come on!

00:10:31.685 --> 00:10:33.153
Please, you gotta
let us outta here!

00:10:33.186 --> 00:10:34.388
We only did this stuff

00:10:34.421 --> 00:10:36.056
'cause we were scared
of Hordy and his crew!

00:10:36.089 --> 00:10:37.724
We're humans, you know!

00:10:37.758 --> 00:10:40.994
This Fishman civil war thing's
got nothing to do with us!

00:10:41.028 --> 00:10:42.963
Besides, tourism
from human pirates

00:10:42.996 --> 00:10:45.265
is good for their
economy, so, uh...

00:10:45.298 --> 00:10:47.834
Yeah, come on, man,
just let us go! Please!

00:10:47.868 --> 00:10:52.606
[JIMBEI] The punishment may not
be as terrible as you think.

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:56.143
Let us wait to hear the
royal family's decision.

00:10:58.412 --> 00:10:59.813
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
There is one fact

00:10:59.846 --> 00:11:03.650
of which we must
make all of you aware.

00:11:03.684 --> 00:11:05.752
The mermaids are safe.

00:11:05.786 --> 00:11:09.856
And as for the Straw Hats, they
were not involved in any way.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.259
[CHILDREN laugh]

00:11:12.292 --> 00:11:14.628
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
We humbly admit that mistakes

00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:16.897
were made in our investigation.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.702
For the unrest that this has
caused, we must apologize.

00:11:21.735 --> 00:11:23.170
[FISHMAN A]
You know, I never doubted

00:11:23.203 --> 00:11:25.105
the Straw Hats for a second.

00:11:25.138 --> 00:11:27.040
I knew it wasn't
them from the start.

00:11:27.074 --> 00:11:28.442
I just didn't want
to say anything!

00:11:28.475 --> 00:11:29.876
[FISHMAN B]
Drop the act!

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.079
We're all to blame! Look at us!

00:11:32.112 --> 00:11:33.480
We didn't trust
them for a second!

00:11:33.513 --> 00:11:35.482
[NEPTUNE]
Hm?

00:11:35.515 --> 00:11:37.818
Nah, we believed 'em
all along, right?

00:11:37.851 --> 00:11:38.518
Yeah!

00:11:38.552 --> 00:11:39.720
Hey, that's not true--!

00:11:39.753 --> 00:11:40.854
Don't say that!

00:11:40.887 --> 00:11:42.322
I heard what you said!

00:11:42.355 --> 00:11:43.690
[FISHBOY F]
Me, too!

00:11:45.292 --> 00:11:46.660
[FISHMAN H]
Admit it.

00:11:46.693 --> 00:11:49.629
We all believed the
Straw Hats were responsible.

00:11:49.663 --> 00:11:53.333
We judged them, just
because they were humans!

00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:55.736
Yeah, you're right.

00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:58.105
We've always been like that.

00:11:58.138 --> 00:12:00.574
I feel awful.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.683
[FRANKY]
Super...

00:12:09.716 --> 00:12:11.418
...Afro!

00:12:11.451 --> 00:12:13.820
[BROOK] Would ya look at
that? It's just like mine!

00:12:13.854 --> 00:12:15.122
[FRANKY]
Yeah, only cooler.

00:12:15.155 --> 00:12:16.356
[USOPP]
Uhh, Chopper?

00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:17.758
You're not looking so good.

00:12:17.791 --> 00:12:20.360
[CHOPPER]
Nah. I'm okay.

00:12:20.393 --> 00:12:22.195
[USOPP]
Whoa!

00:12:22.229 --> 00:12:23.830
Thanks, Robin.

00:12:23.864 --> 00:12:24.498
Good grief.

00:12:24.531 --> 00:12:25.866
[SANJI yells]

00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:28.668
It's because I used
Monster Point, that's all.

00:12:28.702 --> 00:12:30.237
That one wears me out.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.340
I won't be able to
walk for a few hours.

00:12:33.373 --> 00:12:37.077
But I can still treat
your injuries. Slowly.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.879
Now who's hurt?
Let me take a look.

00:12:38.912 --> 00:12:40.781
Worry about yourself first.

00:12:40.814 --> 00:12:42.349
It looks like everyone
here is fine.

00:12:42.382 --> 00:12:43.850
Except for me!

00:12:43.884 --> 00:12:46.686
After all that fighting,
I need to rest my head, too!

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.890
Only your lap can
heal me! Please!

00:12:49.923 --> 00:12:51.892
[ZORO]
Rest it up your ass instead.

00:12:51.925 --> 00:12:53.293
[SANJI]
If Robin wants me to!

00:12:53.326 --> 00:12:54.628
[ZORO]
What?

00:12:54.661 --> 00:12:56.229
[NAMI]
Luffy.

00:12:58.331 --> 00:13:01.701
[MANBOSHI]
We made it! Hey, look up here!

00:13:01.735 --> 00:13:03.436
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
There they are!

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.906
[MANBOSHI, RYUBOSHI]
We're back!

00:13:05.939 --> 00:13:07.641
The princes are here!

00:13:07.674 --> 00:13:11.711
I'm so glad they're okay!

00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:13.713
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT gasps]

00:13:15.649 --> 00:13:17.184
H-Huh?

00:13:17.217 --> 00:13:19.786
It's Hordy and Decken!

00:13:22.722 --> 00:13:24.157
We've returned.

00:13:24.191 --> 00:13:26.760
We're sorry we
worried you, Father.

00:13:29.262 --> 00:13:32.132
[NEPTUNE] All that matters
is that you're safe.

00:13:32.165 --> 00:13:34.401
Now, let's get them locked up.

00:13:34.434 --> 00:13:35.702
[ALL]
Right!

00:13:51.451 --> 00:13:52.953
[FUKABOSHI]
Hear me Citizens!

00:13:52.986 --> 00:13:55.055
There is no need to fear!

00:13:55.088 --> 00:13:58.658
Never again will these villains
cause trouble for our kingdom!

00:13:58.692 --> 00:14:01.995
[FISHMEN cheering]

00:14:02.028 --> 00:14:04.798
Wow. Has this been
a crazy day, or what?

00:14:04.831 --> 00:14:06.266
[RYUBOSHI, MANBOSHI chuckle]

00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:08.335
What a terrible monster that is!

00:14:08.368 --> 00:14:11.304
And to think he was right
here in our neighborhood!

00:14:12.405 --> 00:14:14.441
Huh? Captain Hordy!

00:14:14.474 --> 00:14:16.509
What happened to you?

00:14:16.543 --> 00:14:17.878
[NEPTUNE grunts]

00:14:19.112 --> 00:14:22.015
[FRANKY]
We showed 'em who's boss!

00:14:22.048 --> 00:14:25.285
[SHIRAHOSHI crying]

00:14:25.318 --> 00:14:26.586
[SANJI]
I know that voice.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.288
[BROOK]
That's the princess!

00:14:28.321 --> 00:14:29.923
Seems she's okay!

00:14:29.956 --> 00:14:32.392
[USOPP chuckles]
Hey, Luffy!

00:14:32.425 --> 00:14:35.629
Look, it's the princess
and Straw Hat Luffy!

00:14:35.662 --> 00:14:38.265
Someone help,
I don't know what to do!

00:14:38.298 --> 00:14:43.570
He won't stop bleeding.
I'm afraid he's going to die!

00:15:07.494 --> 00:15:09.930
Whoa! Luffy! Hang in there!

00:15:09.963 --> 00:15:11.631
Wuh-oh.

00:15:15.568 --> 00:15:16.803
Luffy's so brave!

00:15:16.836 --> 00:15:19.706
He could have died out
there fighting for us!

00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:20.674
Hope he's okay.

00:15:20.707 --> 00:15:22.342
[ALL gasping]

00:15:22.375 --> 00:15:23.410
This looks bad.

00:15:23.443 --> 00:15:26.246
But I've got a few
hemostatics here in my bag!

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.715
[CHOPPER]
Thanks a lot, Robin.

00:15:28.748 --> 00:15:29.950
Sure.

00:15:29.983 --> 00:15:33.286
Whoa, is that new form really
worth doing this every time?

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.989
Right! Here we go!

00:15:36.022 --> 00:15:37.090
Let me help you move.

00:15:37.123 --> 00:15:39.392
[USOPP]
Wh-What kind of doctor are you?

00:15:39.426 --> 00:15:41.127
A little left. There!

00:15:41.161 --> 00:15:43.997
Oh, Doctor. Tell me Luffy's
going to be all right!

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.632
I can stop the bleeding,

00:15:45.665 --> 00:15:48.368
but he's lost an
awful lot of blood.

00:15:48.401 --> 00:15:49.736
He needs a donor!

00:15:49.769 --> 00:15:50.704
[BROOK gasps]

00:15:50.737 --> 00:15:52.072
Well, that's no good.

00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:53.640
Luffy's the only one
of us with type F.

00:15:53.673 --> 00:15:55.075
[USOPP]
So we can't do it?

00:15:55.108 --> 00:15:57.410
There's gotta be
someone who can!

00:15:57.444 --> 00:15:58.411
Somebody!

00:15:58.445 --> 00:16:00.180
Help us!

00:16:00.213 --> 00:16:03.583
[CHOPPER] We just need one
person to donate some blood!

00:16:03.616 --> 00:16:05.018
[USOPP]
We're begging you!

00:16:05.051 --> 00:16:07.954
[BROOK]
Somebody here has to be type F!

00:16:07.988 --> 00:16:09.322
[FISHMEN grunt]

00:16:09.356 --> 00:16:11.558
Really? Not s single one of you?

00:16:11.591 --> 00:16:13.460
[FISHMAN U]
I-I'm type F.

00:16:13.493 --> 00:16:15.462
[FISHWOMAN B]
I'm the right type, but...

00:16:15.495 --> 00:16:17.697
Papa! You're type F, right?

00:16:17.731 --> 00:16:19.666
Ah! Well, I, uh...

00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:22.168
Oh! Right! I forgot
In this country

00:16:22.202 --> 00:16:25.205
there's actually a law against
donating blood to humans!

00:16:25.238 --> 00:16:27.440
--What?
--What kinda law is that?

00:16:27.474 --> 00:16:28.575
It's cruel!

00:16:28.608 --> 00:16:29.409
[FISHMEN sigh]

00:16:29.442 --> 00:16:32.212
Oh, come on!
This guy just saved you!

00:16:32.245 --> 00:16:33.613
[FISHMEN grunt]

00:16:33.646 --> 00:16:36.850
I'd like to help, but I'm
afraid my blood isn't type F.

00:16:36.883 --> 00:16:40.353
It is red, though!
Is that good enough?

00:16:40.387 --> 00:16:42.922
[CHOPPER] That's not really
how it works, but thanks!

00:16:42.956 --> 00:16:44.991
Princess Shirahoshi.

00:16:45.025 --> 00:16:48.628
Wait a sec. Maybe the human
pirates can help him!

00:16:49.963 --> 00:16:51.698
You gotta be kidding me!

00:16:51.731 --> 00:16:53.500
Can't you do this
one thing for the guy

00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:55.802
who saved this whole island?

00:17:00.807 --> 00:17:05.812
--[footsteps]
--[FISHMEN gasping]

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.222
[STRAW HAT PIRATES gasp]

00:17:17.524 --> 00:17:20.393
[JIMBEI] You can give
him some of my blood.

00:17:21.628 --> 00:17:25.432
It's type F. Take
as much as you need.

00:17:25.465 --> 00:17:26.433
Wow, really?

00:17:26.466 --> 00:17:27.734
Thanks, Jimbei!

00:17:27.767 --> 00:17:30.036
Wait, but the law.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.073
What of it? I'm a pirate.

00:17:33.106 --> 00:17:35.475
Boss Jimbei. You're the best!

00:17:35.508 --> 00:17:36.843
[BOTH]
Go, Jimbei!

00:17:36.876 --> 00:17:38.311
Wonderful!

00:17:38.344 --> 00:17:39.679
[BOTH laugh]

00:17:39.712 --> 00:17:41.981
Wait, Jimbei. If you...

00:17:42.015 --> 00:17:42.916
[NEPTUNE]
It's all right.

00:17:42.949 --> 00:17:45.585
Huh? But Your Majesty!

00:17:45.618 --> 00:17:47.787
[NEPTUNE]
What makes it so wrong?

00:17:47.821 --> 00:17:50.824
It's precisely that
kind of thinking

00:17:50.857 --> 00:17:53.526
that caused this to begin with.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.096
[ALL laugh]

00:17:56.129 --> 00:17:57.730
[CHOPPER]
Okay, let's do this.

00:17:57.764 --> 00:18:00.767
I'm strong enough to move,
at least for a little while.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.001
[USOPP]
Can I help you somehow?

00:18:02.035 --> 00:18:03.770
[CHOPPER]
Sure, thanks.

00:18:31.431 --> 00:18:33.700
[CHOPPER]
It might sting a little, okay?

00:18:33.733 --> 00:18:35.502
[JIMBEI]
I can take it.

00:18:36.703 --> 00:18:40.707
[FISHMEN murmuring]

00:19:25.084 --> 00:19:27.420
[NARRATOR]
If you harm someone...

00:19:41.167 --> 00:19:44.204
[NARRATOR]
...or if someone harms you...

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:54.447
[NARRATOR] ...the same
red blood is spilled.

00:20:04.357 --> 00:20:07.961
[NARRATOR] And this tube through
which that blood flows...

00:20:18.071 --> 00:20:21.007
[NARRATOR] ...small
and fragile though it is,

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.343
provides a pathway...

00:20:29.449 --> 00:20:33.019
[NARRATOR] ...through the
prejudice that divides us...

00:20:44.097 --> 00:20:47.133
[NARRATOR] ...and the
conflicts that we create...

00:20:52.839 --> 00:20:56.209
[NARRATOR] ...as though
they were never there at all.

00:20:58.911 --> 00:21:01.948
[NARRATOR] And more than any
fleeting dream or fantasy could,

00:21:01.981 --> 00:21:04.651
this path can guide
us to the surface,

00:21:04.684 --> 00:21:08.221
into the warm light of the sun.

00:21:33.246 --> 00:21:35.715
Jimbei.

00:21:35.748 --> 00:21:37.016
Luffy!

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.351
You scared me.

00:21:38.384 --> 00:21:39.752
[BOTH]
Luffy!

00:21:39.786 --> 00:21:41.821
[ALL]
Luffy!

00:21:41.854 --> 00:21:43.690
You rascal.

00:21:43.723 --> 00:21:45.925
So you were awake.

00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:50.129
[ALL]
He's okay!

00:21:50.163 --> 00:21:51.597
[CHILDREN]
Yay, Luffy!

00:21:51.631 --> 00:21:56.636
[FISHMEN cheering]

00:21:59.872 --> 00:22:02.041
[NAMI laughs]

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.069
You see, Mother?

00:22:30.103 --> 00:22:32.238
We made it...

00:22:34.774 --> 00:22:37.143
[FUKABOSHI]
...back to zero.

00:22:51.023 --> 00:22:53.126
[LUFFY]
Hey, Jimbei.

00:22:55.728 --> 00:22:57.563
[chuckles]

00:22:57.597 --> 00:22:59.499
[JIMBEI grunts]

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.841
I want you... to join my crew!

00:23:12.111 --> 00:23:14.213
[NARRATOR] Peace has returned
and a grand celebration

00:23:14.247 --> 00:23:17.383
with dancing and singing
begins at the Ryugu Palace.

00:23:17.417 --> 00:23:20.253
While the Straw Hats enjoy
the party with the merfolk,

00:23:20.286 --> 00:23:24.190
Robin closes in on a piece of
Fishman Island's secret history.

00:23:24.223 --> 00:23:26.392
Realizing the truth
behind Joy Boy and

00:23:26.426 --> 00:23:30.196
the ancient weapon Poseidon,
she uncovers a chilling truth.

00:23:30.229 --> 00:23:31.764
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.798 --> 00:23:35.368
"The Secret Revealed! The Truth
About the Ancient Weapon!"

00:23:35.401 --> 00:23:37.703
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
