1
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,024
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,694
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:44,064
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,866
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,536
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,271
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,207
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,044
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,713
they capture the
unwanted attention

10
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,213
of the World Government,

11
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:03,483
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,220
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,290
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,527
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in intrigue and danger,

15
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:18,131
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,370
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of the Straw Hat crew,

17
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,372
Luffy is headed
to Navy Headquarters

18
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,709
to rescue his brother,
Ace, from execution.

19
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,544
[LUFFY]
Ace.

20
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,746
[NARRATOR]
Three hours remain.

21
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,749
The Navy has gathered every
possible force at Marineford

22
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,653
in anticipation of an attack
by the Whitebeard Pirates.

23
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,556
[SENGOKU]
Ace.

24
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,892
I would like you to tell them
the name of your father.

25
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,563
The name of my father
is Whitebeard.

26
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:50,964
Not true!

27
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,401
[SENGOKU]
And your mother's name?

28
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,871
Portgas D. Rouge.

29
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,873
And thus, a full
year and three months

30
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,610
after the death of his father,
a child was born with the blood

31
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,947
of the world's most odious
villain in his veins.

32
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,718
That child was you.

33
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,390
[SENGOKU]
Your true father...

34
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:20,961
...is Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates!

35
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,767
Then it survived.

36
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,471
His bloodline.

37
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,443
[REUDER]
Roger's bloodline lives!

38
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,713
[LUFFY]
"A Vast Fleet Appears!

39
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:42,148
Here Come the
Whitebeard Pirates!"

40
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,767
That monster had a kid?
I can't believe it.

41
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:05,572
That means the legend of
Gold Roger, it never ended!

42
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,842
[WOMAN A] Why haven't
they killed him already?

43
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,577
If he's the son of the
King of the Pirates,

44
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,412
then he's too dangerous to live.

45
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,849
[MAN C] If only I'd caught him
and put him up for auction,

46
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,884
I could've made a fortune.

47
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,387
[MAN D chuckles]

48
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,258
So many twists
A fine execution!

49
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,593
[MAN E] Does that mean he
got his "fire fist" powers

50
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,761
from his father?

51
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,564
[MAN F] Better yet, ya think
he's got the One Piece?

52
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:34,568
[MAN G] What's it matter,
he's as good as dead.

53
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,936
That bloodline's about to get

54
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,405
wiped off the face
of the planet.

55
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:10,203
Then Ace isn't Luffy's
real brother after all.

56
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,447
Gold Roger?

57
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,115
He's his son?

58
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:27,888
[DOFLAMINGO]
Huh.

59
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,791
A miracle the little
bastard survived this long!

60
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,359
We know the story.

61
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,594
The Navy executed every
person they could find

62
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:38,298
who was connected
to Roger in any way.

63
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,868
But I always thought
his father was Dragon.

64
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,604
That's Luffy's father, right?
And they're brothers.

65
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,573
Yeah, that's what
I thought, too.

66
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:46,774
What's the deal here?

67
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:50,043
Does Luffy know about this
and he never told anyone?

68
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,276
[GOLD ROGER]
Garp.

69
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:30,551
[GOLD ROGER]
Come here.

70
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,753
You're never gonna believe this,

71
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,122
but I've got a baby on the way!

72
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,057
A boy, I bet.

73
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,894
[GOLD ROGER]
For obvious reasons,

74
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,930
I sadly won't be there
for the kid's birth.

75
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,536
[GARP] Why the hell are you
telling this to a Navy officer?

76
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,572
What're you thinking?
You realize what'll happen?

77
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:56,276
Are you trying to get the mother
of your own damn child executed?

78
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:04,552
[GOLD ROGER] I'm telling
you so that doesn't happen.

79
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:05,652
[gasps]

80
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,691
[GOLD ROGER] There's no doubt
the Government'll manage

81
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,794
to dig up my whereabouts
for the past year,

82
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,830
and when they do, they'll
find her and kill her.

83
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,768
[GOLD ROGER] Would you approve
of them punishing a child

84
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,872
who hasn't even been born?

85
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,573
Garp!

86
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,175
You and I have tried
to kill each other

87
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,412
more times than I can count.

88
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:34,715
That aside, I know
you're an honorable man,

89
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,816
one that I can trust.

90
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:49,329
Look after my child.

91
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:55,436
Why me, you selfish bastard?

92
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,972
Because... I know
that you'll do it.

93
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,882
[GOLD ROGER]
Keep him safe for me.

94
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,617
Please, Garp.

95
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:47,955
I don't know.

96
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,957
Are you sure this is this
island we're looking for?

97
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,124
It's gotta be.

98
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,227
There've been a lot of Roger
sightings reported here.

99
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,395
They say he wasn't
acting like a pirate,

100
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,598
but instead, like a man in love.

101
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:00,067
The Navy's put
Roger's era to an end.

102
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,403
And we've gotta cut the
bloodline to keep it that way.

103
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,105
Check for pregnancy tests.

104
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,708
If they happened within
ten months of his capture,

105
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,609
I wanna know about it.

106
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,218
[INVESTIGATOR]
Round up any pregnant women.

107
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,591
[INVESTIGATOR] And kill any
suspicious mothers on the spot.

108
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,443
This month, five were born.

109
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:25,686
[ROUGE humming]

110
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,754
There're several due next month.

111
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:38,632
[ROUGE]
Not yet.

112
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,875
[INVESTIGATOR]
Take in married women, too.

113
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,976
The marriage could be a ruse.

114
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,248
[ASSISTANT] You'll get her back
when we've cleared her.

115
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,126
[ROUGE]
No. Not yet.

116
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,300
[ROUGE] You have to
hold on a while longer.

117
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,373
[ROUGE]
I'm sorry.

118
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,710
[ROUGE]
Not yet.

119
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,915
[ROUGE]
Not yet.

120
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:35,189
[ROUGE]
Not yet.

121
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,392
Not yet.

122
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,926
Not yet.

123
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,733
[MARINE C]
No more pregnant women, sir.

124
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,035
[ASSISTANT] It's been ten
months since he went to jail.

125
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,038
I don't think Roger
sired a child.

126
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,673
[INVESTIGATOR]
So, that really is the end

127
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:55,075
for the King of
the Pirates, huh?

128
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:06,987
[ROUGE'S FATHER]
Get away!

129
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,998
Your name is Portgas
D. Rouge, correct?

130
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:30,711
[BABY ACE crying]

131
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:34,248
[ROUGE]
If it's a girl, Ann.

132
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:37,617
And if it's a boy, Ace.

133
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,055
Those names, he picked them.

134
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:47,661
So his name is Gol D. Ace.

135
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:57,905
[ACE crying]

136
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,974
Our son. Our little boy.

137
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,151
Oh, Ace.

138
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,126
[ROUGE'S FATHER]
Rouge!

139
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,762
[ROUGE'S MOTHER]
Rouge! Stay with us!

140
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:33,206
[ACE crying]

141
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,844
[GARP] I'm gonna need you
to raise this child, Dadan.

142
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,779
[DADAN]
Oh, hell no!

143
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,881
[ACE crying]

144
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,883
[DADAN]
Whose baby is this?

145
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,372
What? Why?

146
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:06,540
I said so.

147
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,709
Starting today,
you're with Dadan.

148
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,510
[LUFFY]
No!

149
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:13,113
You're staying with her family
and that's the end of it.

150
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:14,614
And be nice to 'em.

151
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,354
[ACE] We've both got
the blood of criminals

152
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,189
flowing through our veins,

153
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:26,860
and that was only gift
those bastards ever gave us.

154
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,062
I took the name
"Portgas" from my mother

155
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,565
because I owe her so much.

156
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,769
But I don't owe my
father a damned thing.

157
00:15:34,802 --> 00:15:37,004
He can keep his name.

158
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,472
Whitebeard is my only father.

159
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,478
Got it, old man?

160
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,719
Oh, Garp.

161
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,553
[SENGOKU]
Two years ago,

162
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:56,256
you took your mother's
maiden name as your own.

163
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,392
And with your exquisite
speed and strength,

164
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:01,061
you quickly gained notoriety
throughout the world

165
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:04,398
as the unrelenting captain
of the Spade Pirates.

166
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,367
And that's when we put
the pieces together.

167
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:11,071
There was no doubt that Roger's
blood had been passed on.

168
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:20,380
But Whitebeard came to
the same realization

169
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,682
and got to you before we did.

170
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:26,386
In order to secure your mantle
as the next King of the Pirates,

171
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,824
he warmly accepted the son of
his old rival aboard his ship.

172
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,794
That's not true!

173
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,964
I joined my father's crew in
order to make him the next King!

174
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:40,601
Nobody believes that except you.

175
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:44,238
Why do you think it took us
so long to finally catch you?

176
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,873
You were under
Whitebeard's protection.

177
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:50,911
So today, we know that
if you were to go free,

178
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:54,047
you'd use your abilities
to become the next King.

179
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:57,217
The only recourse we have
to avoid this inevitable risk

180
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,885
is to execute you.

181
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,892
Even if it means we face
the prospect of war

182
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:06,427
with Whitebeard!

183
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:12,465
[MARINES yelling]

184
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,372
We have a situation.
Fleet Admiral.

185
00:17:18,406 --> 00:17:19,706
The Gate of Justice!

186
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,176
It's opening without
any order from us, sir!

187
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,878
And we can't make contact
with the control room!

188
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,479
What did you say?

189
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,056
[JIMBEI]
Hmm.

190
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,891
Maybe if I give it a good hit.

191
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:40,060
Sure, maybe if we knocked.

192
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,662
Do you really think a
punch is going to open it?

193
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,701
[gasps]

194
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,135
[BOTH gasp]

195
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,678
Hey, it worked!

196
00:17:57,711 --> 00:17:59,279
Now that's unexpected.

197
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:03,049
[PRISONER B] It's opening!
Are they actually letting us in?

198
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,251
[PRISONER C]
But that Navy guy said

199
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,420
they were gonna leave us
on the tub current to rot.

200
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:12,426
It's not the control room.
That's in Marineford.

201
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,394
So who's behind this then?

202
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:16,630
[PRISONER D]
Huh?

203
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:21,736
[BUGGY] Keep opening!
Just a little more now!

204
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:24,604
You will open all
the way! I can feel it!

205
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:27,041
My bones are dancing
in total harmony

206
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:30,944
with your whirling gadgets
and gears! We move as one!

207
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,513
Yes, keep going!

208
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:35,549
There we go, there
we go! A little further!

209
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:38,585
Hey, wait, Captain
Buggy, are you--?

210
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,720
[BUGGY yells]

211
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,388
[BUGGY]
Almost there!

212
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:43,223
[PRISONER F]
You're really opening it?

213
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:45,726
[PRISONER G] He's our savior!
He's the chosen one!

214
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,394
Buggy? No way!

215
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,397
Oh, would you stop milking it?

216
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,265
This is clearly a trick!

217
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:56,236
[BUGGY] Seriously,
who is opening the gate?

218
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,271
Maybe the universe
really does want me

219
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,440
to be King of the Pirates.

220
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:06,479
[CREW yelping]

221
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:11,018
Who cares why?
It's open! Let's go!

222
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:12,485
[BUGGY yelping]

223
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,069
It's so quiet.

224
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:32,939
Heh. Yeah, you could cut
the tension with a knife, eh?

225
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,586
[MCGUY]
Right. Let's do this.

226
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:56,597
[MARINE E]
Uh!

227
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,632
They're here!

228
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,468
[MARINE F]
Ready battle stations! Now!

229
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,611
They appeared out of nowhere.

230
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,445
But how did they get in here?

231
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,763
[MARINE G] It's an entire
fleet of pirate ships!

232
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:30,397
[MARINE H]
Keep an eye out for Whitebeard.

233
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,366
He must be there.

234
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,134
Bohemian Knight Doma!

235
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:36,037
Thunder Lord McGuy!

236
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,938
The DeCalvan Brothers!

237
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:40,775
Whirl Spider Squard!

238
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:42,409
It's worse than we expected.

239
00:20:42,443 --> 00:20:44,511
They've got just about
every big-time captain

240
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,613
from the New World with them!

241
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,616
We've counted 43 ships in total,

242
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:51,018
and there's no sign of
Whitebeard or the Commanders.

243
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:55,523
But every single one of them
is a sworn ally of Whitebeard!

244
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:57,591
All right, Ace, we're here.

245
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,960
We've got your back, bro.

246
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:03,463
[MARINES gasping]

247
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:06,833
Listen to those children
panic. It's pathetic.

248
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,670
They actually came?

249
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:11,872
[MARINE I]
Should we attack?

250
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:13,073
[MARINE J]
Not yet.

251
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:15,609
Whitebeard's gotta be
around here somewhere.

252
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:19,914
He's planning somethin' big,
so keep your eyes on the sea.

253
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,215
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

254
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:23,883
Now this is fun!
I'm ready for some war!

255
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:26,386
Now come on,
Whitebeard, I'm hungry.

256
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:46,106
It's him.

257
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:52,046
[MARINES whispering]

258
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,580
Where is he?

259
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:59,052
Go figure. It's a surprise
attack. Whitebeard is no fool.

260
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,221
Oh, don't act like
you're so smart.

261
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:13,533
[MARINE M] There's a shadow
in the middle of the bay.

262
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:14,701
[MARINE N]
What's happening?

263
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:26,780
[SENGOKU] It's just as I feared.
Why didn't we plan for this?

264
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:31,918
They got their ships coated
to ambush us from underwater.

265
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,367
[MARINES gasping, whispering]

266
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,570
[MARINE O] It's Whitebeard's
ship, the Moby Dick!

267
00:22:57,411 --> 00:23:00,480
[MARINES yelling]

268
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:15,396
[NARRATOR] Much to the
surprise of the Navy,

269
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:18,732
the Moby Dick surfaces in
the middle of Marineford.

270
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,367
On the deck stands Whitebeard,

271
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,935
the man who Ace calls father,

272
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:25,205
and his 14 Commanders,
the pirates he calls family,

273
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:28,942
who share Luffy's determination
to stop the execution.

274
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,510
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

275
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:34,047
"The Beginning of the War!
Ace and Whitebeard's Past!"

276
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,449
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
