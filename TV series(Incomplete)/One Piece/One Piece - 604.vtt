00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:05.464
without those corpses.

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:06.899
And if we don't
have their bodies,

00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:10.302
how can we be sure the Straw
Hats, Law, and Smoker are dead?

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:13.205
What do you think,
Vergo? Are they?

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:17.109
There is one thing
we can be sure of.

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:20.546
Whatever happened, Straw Hat and
the others are not in that cage.

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:23.215
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Huh? They got free?

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:25.217
And why would you think that?

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.887
The Navy G-5 is nothing but
a bunch of useless meatheads.

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:31.023
I seriously doubt they
would be able to escape

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:32.558
from the gas on their own.

00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:35.728
They're far too stupid to
manage something like that.

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:38.063
What's your point?

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:40.666
It's that they
likely had assistance.

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:42.634
Straw Hat and the rest
escaped the cage,

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.636
and helped the G-5
marines, as well.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.272
They broke out? Impossible.

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:51.110
Get ready!

00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:58.283
Tashigi. Until I get back,

00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:00.552
I'm leaving you in charge
of the men, understood?

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:04.523
Get back? But where
are you going, Smoker?

00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:07.493
Vergo! That's who
you're after, right?

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:09.795
I can't let him get away.

00:17:09.828 --> 00:17:11.630
The law won't see
that traitor punished

00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:14.433
the way he deserves
to be. You know that.

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:15.734
[TASHIGI gasps]

00:17:15.768 --> 00:17:17.770
I have to handle it myself.

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:20.773
Nobody screws around
with my navy.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.980
Wait! At least
take me with you, sir!

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:32.084
I can help.

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:34.453
You know how strong Vergo is.

00:17:34.486 --> 00:17:36.188
If something were
to happen to you--

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:38.490
[SMOKER] Then our men would need
someone to look after them.

00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:39.491
[gasps]

00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:41.794
[SMOKER] Go, Tashigi.
Help those fools escape.

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:43.762
The children, too.

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:52.504
Good luck, Vice-Admiral.

00:17:57.943 --> 00:18:00.245
Huh? Is it true?

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:03.215
Luffy really got beaten
by that maniac Caesar?

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:06.018
It's true, and there was even
a little bit of suffocation

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:07.986
thrown into the mix
for good measure.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.723
He manipulates gas, and that
makes him one dangerous bastard.

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:14.626
He sucks the oxygen
right out of the air.

00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:22.201
We let the Yetis get the
drop on us, now this crap, too?

00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:28.073
That is so pathetic.

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.575
[USOPP]
Hm?

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:32.845
What the hell is wrong with us?

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:48.360
[ZORO] We gave up two years.
Was it all for nothing?

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.729
Well, try looking
at it this way:

00:18:50.762 --> 00:18:52.064
we're all still
alive, aren't we?

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:53.465
Maybe not for long!

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:54.967
[USOPP gasps]

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.669
[ZORO] If we keep letting
ourselves get caught off guard,

00:18:57.703 --> 00:19:00.105
we're gonna get killed.

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:02.307
[USOPP]
Hey, what are you doing?

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:03.575
What?

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:05.577
Get ready! Don't
let 'em through!

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:07.446
[MARINES]
Yeah!

00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:10.716
Hey, Luffy!

00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:17.122
Why won't these idiots
just give up? Hm?

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:19.625
[ZORO]
Luffy!

00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:21.360
What's Moss Head up to now?

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:23.295
This better be good.

00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:29.168
[MARINES yell]

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:37.543
[MARINES gasping]

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:39.645
Luffy, you hear me?

00:19:42.247 --> 00:19:43.782
Zoro?

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:48.854
You have got to get it together!

00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:50.189
We're in the New World!

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:51.623
Stakes are high!

00:19:51.657 --> 00:19:53.158
[LUFFY gasps]

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:10.909
Just what we needed.

00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:13.178
A kick in the ass.

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:16.148
Yeah, real sorry!

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:18.550
Won't happen again, promise!

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:24.323
[BROOK laughs]

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.330
[LUFFY yells]

00:20:31.363 --> 00:20:32.664
[SUBORDINATE B]
It's Straw Hat!

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:36.068
Bring him down before
he can do anything stupid!

00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:39.705
[LUFFY yells]

00:20:47.646 --> 00:20:49.648
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:51.183
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:02.861
[LUFFY]
...UFO!

00:21:02.894 --> 00:21:06.632
[LUFFY laughs]
See, I got this!

00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:08.267
Can you take anything seriously?

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.370
[USOPP laughs]

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:13.972
Huh?

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:17.542
[SUBORDINATE A panting]
Master!

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:18.644
[CAESAR CLOWN]
What's the matter?

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:21.079
It's Straw Hat,
the Navy--everybody.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:22.848
They're here, they're inside!

00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:24.349
They got away from
the poison gas,

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:26.184
and they're in building A now!

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:29.655
They're all about to advance
further into the laboratory!

00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:31.556
They're here?!

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.825
How is that even possible?

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:35.961
They shouldn't have been able
to get out of that cage,

00:21:35.994 --> 00:21:38.430
let alone make it through
the laboratory door!

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:39.965
How did they get inside?

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:41.800
[SUBORDINATE A]
We don't know, sir.

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:43.168
More than anything,

00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:46.138
I don't like that Law
is on the loose now.

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:48.373
Depending on what he intends,

00:21:48.407 --> 00:21:51.376
I may need to take care
of him personally.

00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:58.650
[LUFFY laughing]
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:02.354
[LUFFY yells]

00:22:02.387 --> 00:22:04.489
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:09.127
[LUFFY giggles]
And here we go!

00:22:17.402 --> 00:22:19.371
[NARRATOR] Luffy and friends
desperately flee

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:23.008
from the lethal Land of the Dead
that leaked into the laboratory.

00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:26.111
At this rate, the only way to
avoid suffering an instant death

00:22:26.144 --> 00:22:28.814
is to pass through the gate
that looms up ahead.

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:32.451
Meanwhile, the G-5
demonstrates their Navy pride.

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:34.052
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:37.956
"Tashigi's Tears! G-5's
Desperate Breakthrough Plan!"

00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:40.826
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
