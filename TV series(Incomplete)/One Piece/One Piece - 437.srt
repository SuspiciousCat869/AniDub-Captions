1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,658
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,394
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,697
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,567
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,370
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,138
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,074
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,777
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,412
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,114
of the World Government,

47
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:05,151
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

48
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,620
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

49
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:11,191
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

50
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,360
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

51
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:19,132
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

52
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,605
[NARRATOR] After being
separated from his crew,

53
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,641
Luffy set out to rescue
his captured brother, Ace.

54
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:32,312
To do so, he snuck into the
government prison, Impel Down.

55
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,448
[NARRATOR]
Buggy and Mr. 3,

56
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,817
who were desperately trying
to make their way to freedom,

57
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,053
have been captured by Hannyabal.

58
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,457
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Luffy's
battle against Warden Magellan

59
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,593
had reached a dire outcome.

60
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,164
[MAGELLAN] Consider this
your punishment, child.

61
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,800
There's no way to neutralize
the amount of poison

62
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,202
your body has absorbed.

63
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,373
You will suffer in
agonizing pain for 24 hours,

64
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:05,111
and then you will die.
This is true hell.

65
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,884
[LUFFY]
"For His Friend!

66
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,787
Bon Clay's Deadly
Rescue Attempt"!

67
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,329
[GUARD A] Warden Magellan,
excellent battle, sir!

68
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,498
What should we do
with Luffy? Any orders?

69
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,868
[MAGELLAN] He'll die soon but we
don't want him just lying there.

70
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:33,139
Throw him into the Central Tower
of Level 5 until further notice.

71
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,874
[GUARDS]
Yes, sir!

72
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,442
[GUARD B panting]

73
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,778
[GUARD B] Warden Magellan,
bad news, sir!

74
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,748
There's a problem over at
the staircase to Level 3!

75
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,684
That's the area Hannyabal
and his men were guarding.

76
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,618
What's happening there?

77
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,720
[GUARD B]
I don't know the details, sir!

78
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,626
[PRISONER A]
Hey. Hey!

79
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,528
Guess he's gone.

80
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,798
He's either stone cold dead
or hibernating for the winter.

81
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,934
Heh. Sounds nice.

82
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,604
[PRISONER B]
Damn, my fingers are shot.

83
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,374
I can't move 'em!
I can't even feel 'em!

84
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,309
[lPRISONER C laughing]

85
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,743
Sounds like frostbite!

86
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,146
Sorry, you're history.

87
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,348
[PRISON D gasping]

88
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,684
[PRISONER D] I can't even
bite my stinking bread!

89
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,286
Can we stop by
the Burning Hell for a sec?

90
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,964
[PRISONER A]
Check it out.

91
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,834
They're dragging in a newbie.
Sucks to be him.

92
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,303
Hey, pal! What's your name?

93
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,638
[PRISONER E]
How much is your bounty worth?

94
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,240
Come on! Talk to us!

95
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,976
[gasps] Looks like
he's nearly dead.

96
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,280
Magellan's already given him
a taste of his poison.

97
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,515
[grunts]

98
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,819
[MAGELLAN] I leave for a moment
and this is what I return to?

99
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,660
Hannyabal, I counted on you,
and you let me down!

100
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,998
Wake up, you imbecile!
What the hell happened here?

101
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,234
[HANNYABAL choking]

102
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,904
Warden, please!
You're choking me!

103
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,744
[coughs] I was caught off guard!

104
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,479
I'm sorry, sir!

105
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,681
No! Don't torture us!

106
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,250
Torture stinks like ass!
And, by the way,

107
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:27,787
mine is very sensitive,
so please don't whip it!

108
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,723
Some nutty martial artist
ballerina did all this!

109
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,593
I'll be frank with you,
he took us by surprise, sir!

110
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,695
[MAGELLAN]
Silence! No excuses!

111
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,729
You let him slip away

112
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,998
and he escaped to
the upper levels, didn't he?

113
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,033
It seems that prisoner
used to be part

114
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,902
of Crocodile's Baroque Works.

115
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:46,606
He's the one who used
to call himself "Mister 2."

116
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,408
He's rather odd.

117
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,942
I don't care.

118
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,011
At any rate,
I wouldn't worry, sir.

119
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,814
I feel confident that
we'll catch him in time.

120
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,984
And what of the riot
on Level 2? Any updates?

121
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,787
[GUARD D] It's winding down.
Almost under control, sir.

122
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,556
I want all the guards on Level 4

123
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,559
to proceed to
Level 3, immediately.

124
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,028
I also want all of
Mistress Sadie's Demon Guards

125
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,764
searching for the escapee.

126
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,633
I'll leave the rest to you.

127
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,835
[GUARD D] Right! And what
about these two, sir?

128
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:19,739
Do as you like. Just make sure
this mess is all cleaned up

129
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,075
and things are in order
by the time I get back.

130
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,779
I'm going to head over to
my "private place" for a bit.

131
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,420
[MAGELLAN]
Oh, my tummy.

132
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,756
Uh. The runs.

133
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,692
[HANNYABAL] Hey! Move it!
Get off your asses!

134
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:43,529
We still have one last escapee
we need to track down!

135
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,697
[GUARD E]
Yes, right away, sir.

136
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,766
[GUARD F]
Um, excuse me, Vice Warden,

137
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,701
what do you wanna
do with these two?

138
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,871
Oh, I want to ask them
a few questions.

139
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,806
Get an interrogation room.

140
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,842
I'll take charge
of them personally.

141
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,777
[GUARD F]
Right, understood, sir.

142
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,645
I'll make the preparations.

143
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,784
[BOTH yelping]

144
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,619
Okay then, they're all yours.

145
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,698
[HANNYABAL]
Right.

146
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,678
[HANNYABAL] So far so good,
wouldn't you say?

147
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,149
[laughs] Too easy.

148
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:31,719
Yes, no one's whipping
my buttocks tonight.

149
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:34,522
Okay, that's that.
Now, what do we do?

150
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,890
Don't play dumb!

151
00:08:35,923 --> 00:08:38,993
You know what's next.
We need to hurry up and...

152
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:41,696
...rescue Straw Hat
before it's too late!

153
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,197
You're still hung up on that?

154
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,466
Didn't you hear them saying
that he's been poisoned

155
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:48,836
by Magellan and taken to Level
5? It's too late to save him!

156
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,438
There's no way he'll survive

157
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:52,707
and we'll be caught,
tortured, and die like dogs!

158
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,975
It's a bad plan!

159
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:55,142
Why should we risk our lives

160
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:57,111
to save someone
who's as good as dead?

161
00:08:57,144 --> 00:09:00,548
That won't stop me! I'll gladly
die like a dog for him!

162
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:04,218
After turning my back on Straw
Boy, I'm already dead inside!

163
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,855
The least I can do
is make things right!

164
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,057
I thought that it was better
to run and save myself

165
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,726
than to suffer the same fate,

166
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,528
but I swore that if there was
any chance he would survive,

167
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:18,499
I'd return, put my life
on the line, and rescue him.

168
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:22,136
And I meant it.
So, I must come to his aid!

169
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:24,505
Yeah, that's a real
touching story!

170
00:09:24,538 --> 00:09:27,174
But now, you've escaped!
You're almost a free man!

171
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,810
Why would you want to go back
out there guns a'blazing

172
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:32,813
and risk your life again?

173
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:35,049
[BON CLAY growling]

174
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:39,720
Because, I'm his friend!
I don't need any other reason!

175
00:09:39,754 --> 00:09:42,556
[BOTH]
That's... it?

176
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,491
Uh?

177
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:45,192
First, we've gotta deal
with that poison.

178
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:48,162
There's-- Surely they have
some sort of antidote.

179
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:50,097
But then, where would it be?

180
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,100
You think there's still time
to get an antidote?

181
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,769
Nah, I wouldn't bother.

182
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,604
[BON CLAY]
Shut up already, both of you!

183
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,807
This is something--
This is something I have to do!

184
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,278
Don't die on me, Straw Boy!
Hold on a little bit longer!

185
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,580
No freaking way!

186
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:09,250
I mean, uh... what do you mean
you can't make an antidote?

187
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:10,851
What is the hold up?

188
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:11,919
[DOCTOR A]
No one ever survives

189
00:10:11,953 --> 00:10:14,021
after Warden Magellan
douses them with that much

190
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:15,690
of his special attack.

191
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:17,992
If it was just one kind
of poison, maybe,

192
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:20,795
but his is a special
multi-faceted toxin.

193
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,064
There are just too many
variables to account for.

194
00:10:23,097 --> 00:10:24,765
I'm afraid it's
impossible, Vice Warden.

195
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,567
What the--? You're kidding!

196
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,670
And you people call yourselves
a medical team? Lies!

197
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:30,771
[BOTH]
Huh?

198
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:33,207
Uhh... I mean,
"The answer lies ahead."

199
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,275
Just keep trying!

200
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:36,877
We have to turn Straw Hat
Luffy over to the Navy,

201
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:38,846
and I want him alive for that.

202
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,715
[DOCTOR A] But even if
we think we're on to a cure,

203
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:43,217
if we administer any sort
of medication incorrectly,

204
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,119
he'll most likely
die even sooner!

205
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:47,121
[grunting]

206
00:10:47,154 --> 00:10:49,256
[BUGGY]
I told you! It's hopeless!

207
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,025
Let it go and move on!

208
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:53,728
[MR. 3] You heard them.
There is no antidote!

209
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:56,230
You'd be throwing
your life away for nothing!

210
00:10:56,263 --> 00:10:58,032
[growling]

211
00:10:58,065 --> 00:11:01,168
Now, let go of that nonsense
and think about escaping.

212
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,637
Let's find a way out
of here together!

213
00:11:03,671 --> 00:11:05,806
He's right.

214
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,275
You need to learn when
to give up, my friend.

215
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:12,079
We'll melt away if we stay
here very much longer.

216
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:13,614
You gotta face it.

217
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:15,082
No matter how hard you may try,

218
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:18,185
Straw Hat's past the point
of no return. Understand?

219
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,254
[MR. 3] It was reckless
of him to go head-to-head

220
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:22,323
against Magellan
in the first place.

221
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,892
There's a reason he has
such a fearful reputation.

222
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:27,995
No one survives a battle with
him. It would take a miracle!

223
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,697
Hm?

224
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,931
A miracle?

225
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:32,099
[BOTH]
Huh?

226
00:11:33,868 --> 00:11:36,237
Oh, yeah! I forgot about him!

227
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:41,342
He's in Impel Down! My hero,
"The Miracle Worker"!

228
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,012
When doctors give up on a
patient, he can still save them.

229
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:47,081
He can even save
a dying country!

230
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:50,651
His list of miracles
is legendary. He's the greatest!

231
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:53,320
The Queen of all Queens! Iva!

232
00:11:53,354 --> 00:11:54,388
Come on!

233
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,323
We need to find out where
they're holding him now!

234
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:59,693
[BOTH]
We need to... what?

235
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,199
Sir, Level 5?

236
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:06,934
[BON CLAY (HANNYABAL)]
Yep, that's where we're headed.

237
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:08,169
Prisoner transfer.

238
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:10,371
These two were sentenced
to freeze to death.

239
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:13,374
What the hell is he doing?
Why are we going down?

240
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:14,909
What choice do we have?

241
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,977
We could try to
escape on our own,

242
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:18,846
but by now,
the security on Level 3

243
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,915
has been tightened
by order of Magellan himself.

244
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,284
We'll never get past
that many guards!

245
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:24,919
We're safer like this for now.

246
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,821
As long as we stay with
the "Vice Warden,"

247
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:29,323
we can at least move around
without any hassle.

248
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:31,092
Look, I know that,

249
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,127
but his obsession
with saving Straw Hat

250
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,895
is going to be the end of us!

251
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:36,897
We can't keep this up
forever, you know!

252
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:40,401
[MR. 3] Yes, but perhaps a "plan
B" will present itself in time.

253
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,148
Keep walking, scum bags!

254
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:56,283
[BON CLAY] I realize this
is a bit of a long shot,

255
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,452
but I have to do anything I can.

256
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,921
This list of prisoners
is presenting more questions

257
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:02,790
than it's answering, I'm afraid.

258
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,225
Like this, for example,

259
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:06,994
Emporio Ivankov,
the real name of Iva,

260
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:10,397
has been crossed off in red ink.
Has he been released already?

261
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:13,200
Or has he been
secretly executed?

262
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:19,140
Tell me something, did we
let this prisoner go free?

263
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,876
What? Oh, you mean Ivankov!

264
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:25,312
"You-know-what" happened
to him a few years ago.

265
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,948
"You-know-what"?

266
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:31,152
Wait, Vice Warden, you forgot?

267
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,988
Huh? Oh, yeah! Of course!

268
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,890
I remember!

269
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:38,759
Now, let's see if you know, huh?

270
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,794
But there are
prisoners present, sir.

271
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:42,196
[BON CLAY (HANNYABAL)]
I don't care! Out with it!

272
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:45,299
Every so often,
people disappear in Impel Down.

273
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:47,268
We're sure they
didn't just break out,

274
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:49,503
as some of the missing
could barely move.

275
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,071
They just vanished
without a trace,

276
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:52,873
and no one seems
to know the cause.

277
00:13:52,907 --> 00:13:55,843
We've come to call it,
"demoning away."

278
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,078
All the guards here have
come to fear these unnatural

279
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:00,080
and strange disappearances.

280
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:01,415
We believe that those missing

281
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,350
have been dragged
to the gates of hell,

282
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,153
hence why we call it what we do.

283
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:09,757
So, people just up and vanish?

284
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,895
Creepy. I wished
I'd never heard that.

285
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:16,096
Yeah, same here.

The door's not even open,
and it's already freezing!

00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:23,370

wearing heavy clothes.

As a fair warning, the Army
Wolves are quite hungry today.

291
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,879
Now, I'll take them from
this point on, just as usual.

Huh. Honestly, sir,
we don't know how you do it.

296
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:42,389
You always tell us,

"I'll show every single prisoner
the courage of the Vice Warden,"

298
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:48,028
and then march forward
into the Freezing Hell
