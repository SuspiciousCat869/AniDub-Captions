WEBVTT

00:02:34.876 --> 00:02:37.381
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.154
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.254 --> 00:02:45.463
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.869
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.242
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.342 --> 00:02:52.979
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.384
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:58.557
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:02.498
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.101
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:08.443
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:12.652
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:18.062 --> 00:03:20.033
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:23.206
and targeted the Don Quixote
Family in Dressrosa.

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:26.379
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.817
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.921
In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:31.021 --> 00:03:32.792
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:32.892 --> 00:03:34.997
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives,

00:03:35.097 --> 00:03:38.369
until at last,
only their leader remained.

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:40.808
Now, the fate of Dressrosa
will be decided

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:44.348
in a one-on-one duel between
Luffy and Doflamingo.

00:03:44.448 --> 00:03:47.487
"Fourth Gear"? Do tell.

00:03:49.158 --> 00:03:52.565
[LUFFY]
Muscle Balloon!

00:04:13.874 --> 00:04:18.750
Fourth Gear!

00:04:19.886 --> 00:04:23.527
Bounce-Man!

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:29.405
[LUFFY]
Rhino Schneider!

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:32.444
Now, Gum-Gum...

00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:37.221
...Culverin!

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:38.690
[DOFLAMINGO]
Athlete!

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:45.638
[LUFFY] You think that's
gonna work on me?

00:04:45.738 --> 00:04:47.975
Not now!

00:04:48.977 --> 00:04:51.850
And now, Gum-Gum...

00:04:52.952 --> 00:04:54.789
...Culverin!

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.093
[LUFFY grunts]

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:17.134
[LUFFY]
"A Massive Counterattack!

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:19.639
Doflamingo's Awakening!"

00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:34.101
[panting]

00:05:37.642 --> 00:05:38.778
[TOWNSMAN A]
He got a beating.

00:05:38.878 --> 00:05:40.280
[TOWNSWOMAN A]
Doflamingo?

00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:41.817
[TOWNSMAN A]
From a ball?

00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:42.985
How?

00:06:06.398 --> 00:06:07.902
Hang on. Who's that?

00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:09.773
He's strong! Wow!

00:06:09.873 --> 00:06:10.574
Knock him dead!

00:06:10.674 --> 00:06:12.377
You can do it!

00:06:12.478 --> 00:06:14.147
[babbles]

00:06:18.356 --> 00:06:19.424
[CAVENDISH]
Straw Hat?

00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:20.794
[LAW]
Yeah.

00:06:20.894 --> 00:06:24.101
He's so different now.
Is that him?

00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:26.507
I mean, it's hard to believe!

00:06:26.607 --> 00:06:30.046
Why, if he can
overpower Doflamingo,

00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:31.449
he must be quite strong!

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.089
But he's overusing his Haki.

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.697
Oh dear. Really?

00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:03.112
Straw Hat. Where'd you
run off to?

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:06.119
[BURGESS]
Ah, there he is.

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:08.858
Guess they're playing
somewhere else now.

00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.494
And after I went to
all that trouble

00:07:10.595 --> 00:07:13.366
to come over here and see them!

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:14.836
[KOALA]
The captain of the first ship

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:17.742
of the Blackbeard Pirates.
Jesus Burgess.

00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:20.279
[KOALA] I was wondering
where he ended up

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.618
after the battle
at the coliseum.

00:07:22.718 --> 00:07:25.223
Looks like I found him!

00:07:25.323 --> 00:07:27.728
Chase them or wait?

00:07:27.828 --> 00:07:30.099
Either way,
they're mine for sure!

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:33.205
I'll get what I want,
no matter what!

00:07:33.305 --> 00:07:36.311
[laughs]

00:07:36.412 --> 00:07:38.818
[KOALA] I was right,
he's after Luffy's group.

00:07:38.918 --> 00:07:40.721
But what's his motive?

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.100
[DOLDO]
Viola.

00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:50.307
His fight with Luffy is
all that remains, correct?

00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:51.876
[VIOLET]
That's right, Father.

00:07:51.977 --> 00:07:53.547
All of the Top Executives
and their underlings

00:07:53.647 --> 00:07:55.049
have been eliminated.

00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:56.887
Only Doflamingo remains.

00:07:56.987 --> 00:07:59.826
In other words,
if Doflamingo is defeated,

00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:03.032
then the Birdcage slicing up
the town will disappear,

00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:05.738
and the Family
will fall forever.

00:08:05.838 --> 00:08:08.043
Is that what you're saying?

00:08:08.143 --> 00:08:09.177
[VIOLET]
Yes.

00:08:15.123 --> 00:08:17.996
[ZORO]
Huh? Wait, where did they go?

00:08:18.096 --> 00:08:20.367
Oh, don't tell me
they got lost.

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:24.776
[KIN'EMON] Sir Zoro!
That's not the proper direction!

00:08:26.012 --> 00:08:27.180
What?

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.884
[KIN'EMON] Navigation is
a weakness of yours,

00:08:28.984 --> 00:08:31.422
so if we follow you
we'll never get there!

00:08:31.523 --> 00:08:33.126
Here. Climb aboard.

00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:34.295
We can fly!

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:35.831
[BIRD A sqwuaks]

00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:38.202
What is that? And why's it
so weird-looking?

00:08:38.302 --> 00:08:41.275
This is a Spring Sparrow.
He summoned it!

00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:44.214
It came here from the
King's Plateau to aid us!

00:08:44.314 --> 00:08:45.685
It's perfectly safe.

00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:47.589
Come now, we must
travel swiftly.

00:08:47.689 --> 00:08:49.324
[BIRD A sqwuaks]

00:08:49.424 --> 00:08:52.865
[ZORO] You expect me to
ride on this Spring Squawker?

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:55.237
[KANJURO]
Now you've hurt its feelings.

00:08:55.337 --> 00:08:58.744
Well. I guess I have
no choice. Make room.

00:09:00.046 --> 00:09:01.883
Let us proceed!

00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:05.591
[ALL gasp]

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:07.895
[BIRD A roars]

00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:19.017
[KIN'EMON] You must not falter,
Spring Sparrow!

00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:45.069
Uh-oh. It finally
made its way here.

00:09:46.973 --> 00:09:50.647
Let's move, Tontattas!
Hurry it up!

00:09:52.117 --> 00:09:53.486
[INHEL, CHAO]
We're on our way!

00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:55.090
[FRANKY]
Step on it!

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.262
Or else you guys're gonna be
super dead in a minute!

00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:07.615
[CHAO] We managed to
rescue all our friends

00:10:07.715 --> 00:10:09.118
who were stranded
in the factory!

00:10:09.218 --> 00:10:11.188
We're good to go!

00:10:11.288 --> 00:10:12.658
[FRANKY]
Sweet!

00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:21.042
[FLAPPER] Hey,
the building's leaning over!

00:10:21.142 --> 00:10:23.213
Fraland! Why is
the SMILE Factory

00:10:23.313 --> 00:10:25.383
the only thing that's
not getting cut up?

00:10:25.484 --> 00:10:27.889
[FRANKY]
Hm? Wait, it's not?

00:10:27.989 --> 00:10:30.595
Right, the Sea Prism Stone!

00:10:30.695 --> 00:10:32.063
[INHEL]
Sea Prism?

00:10:32.163 --> 00:10:34.836
Yeah. That's what the walls
are made out of.

00:10:34.936 --> 00:10:37.006
It's pretty strong stuff.

00:10:37.106 --> 00:10:39.946
Which means, the strings
cut everything else,

00:10:40.046 --> 00:10:42.251
but the factory won't crack.

00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:43.554
Here. Watch.

00:10:43.654 --> 00:10:44.856
[FLAPPER gasps]

00:10:52.037 --> 00:10:53.974
[FRANKY]
They're just pushing it.

00:10:55.443 --> 00:10:56.311
[FRANKY]
Hey, it's them!

00:10:56.411 --> 00:10:57.615
Franky!

00:10:57.715 --> 00:10:59.451
Ah! Sir Robot!

00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:03.192
[DWARVES cheer]

00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:06.533
[FLAPPER]
Zoroland! Topknot-land!

00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:08.537
Uh, guys? What gives?

00:11:08.637 --> 00:11:11.976
Center of the country is
kind of in the other direction.

00:11:12.076 --> 00:11:13.980
Wanna run? Turn around!

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.819
What? We're not running!

00:11:16.919 --> 00:11:18.958
We wanna stop the strings!

00:11:19.058 --> 00:11:20.360
[FRANKY]
Stop 'em?

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.264
Tch. I didn't even
think about that!

00:11:22.364 --> 00:11:25.871
[DWARVES]
Wow! That's amazing!

00:11:25.971 --> 00:11:28.108
It's not over until
Luffy settles the score.

00:11:28.208 --> 00:11:30.179
But we can buy some time!

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:33.085
[DWARVES gasp]

00:11:33.185 --> 00:11:36.993
[FRANKY] Stoppin' the strings
does sound good, but how?

00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:41.435
[FRANKY]
Hm? Oh yeah!

00:11:47.314 --> 00:11:53.192
[LUFFY panting]

00:12:01.275 --> 00:12:03.012
[DOFLAMINGO] Even with
his Armament active,

00:12:03.112 --> 00:12:06.786
he can still expand and
contract with such precision.

00:12:10.995 --> 00:12:14.936
[DOFLAMINGO] Armament and rubber
working in harmony, huh?

00:12:15.036 --> 00:12:17.373
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:12:18.309 --> 00:12:24.221
[panting]

00:12:24.321 --> 00:12:27.393
If I take too long,
I'll change back!

00:12:29.264 --> 00:12:30.701
[DOFLAMINGO] It seems
like you've figured out

00:12:30.801 --> 00:12:33.339
how to use that
ability pretty well.

00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:36.411
It must take a toll
on you after a while.

00:12:36.512 --> 00:12:38.249
I'm sure it has its risks.

00:12:38.349 --> 00:12:40.854
Now, Gum-Gum...

00:12:40.954 --> 00:12:42.992
You're tired, aren't you?

00:12:43.092 --> 00:12:44.729
How long can you hold out?

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:46.298
...Double...

00:12:47.835 --> 00:12:52.244
[DOFLAMINGO] You know, I can use
my strings as much as I like.

00:12:52.344 --> 00:12:53.713
...Culverin!

00:12:53.813 --> 00:12:55.817
Ha! Off-White!

00:12:59.157 --> 00:13:02.230
[gasps] The ground?
How did you do that?

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.203
Bastard. What have you
done to this town?

00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:08.877
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
Listen closely, rookie.

00:13:11.048 --> 00:13:13.620
My Devil Fruit's power ascended.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.091
They've reached a new horizon.

00:13:16.191 --> 00:13:19.164
A higher state,
known as "Awakening."

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.652
[LUFFY] Whoa, he turned
the buildings into strings!

00:13:29.752 --> 00:13:34.160
[chuckles] Awakening is
extremely rare, but with it,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.369
my strings can affect
more than just my own body!

00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:40.974
Damn. His strings are
all over the place!

00:13:41.074 --> 00:13:43.345
This can't be a Paramecia!

00:13:43.445 --> 00:13:46.018
No matter which way you go,
there's more strings!

00:13:46.118 --> 00:13:47.588
Fun, right?

00:13:49.324 --> 00:13:50.527
[DOFLAMINGO]
At this rate, you won't even

00:13:50.627 --> 00:13:52.631
be able to get near me.

00:13:57.809 --> 00:14:01.481
[panting]

00:14:01.582 --> 00:14:04.989
Tick-tock. Any minute now,
your body's going to give out.

00:14:05.089 --> 00:14:07.494
And mine'll keep on going.

00:14:07.595 --> 00:14:10.433
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:39.658
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:15:08.817 --> 00:15:09.919
[LUFFY gasps]

00:15:12.991 --> 00:15:17.935
[panting] He won't quit!

00:15:19.638 --> 00:15:24.080
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
Had enough? How 'bout this?

00:15:31.062 --> 00:15:34.467
[panting]

00:15:34.568 --> 00:15:37.039
Your Haki's about to
run out, Straw Hat.

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:39.779
That's when I'll deliver
the finishing blow!

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:42.718
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:15:42.818 --> 00:15:44.321
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:47.026
[TOWNSMAN C] We have to run,
or we'll get sliced up!

00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:05.329
[TOWNSMAN G] Head downtown
if you want to survive!

00:16:05.429 --> 00:16:08.001
Those strings are
moving really fast!

00:16:10.106 --> 00:16:12.511
Oh no, Grandma!

00:16:12.611 --> 00:16:15.349
You gotta stand up
or you won't make it!

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.754
[TOWNSWOMAN D]
I'm sorry.

00:16:20.226 --> 00:16:23.098
[TOWNSWOMAN D]
I can't run any more.

00:16:24.434 --> 00:16:27.642
[TOWNSWOMAN D] Leave me
and save yourself, dear!

00:16:27.742 --> 00:16:28.943
I won't do that!

00:16:29.043 --> 00:16:31.348
I'm not gonna abandon you!

00:16:32.551 --> 00:16:35.824
Hurry. Run! This is the
end for me, either way.

00:16:35.924 --> 00:16:37.662
Come on. Get up!

00:16:37.762 --> 00:16:39.230
I'm telling you.

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:41.134
I don't have enough
strength to run downtown.

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:43.305
You should go! Quickly!

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.252
People! We need help here!

00:16:50.352 --> 00:16:53.259
All these patients!
They can't get out!

00:16:53.359 --> 00:16:55.697
And we can't carry
them by ourselves!

00:16:55.797 --> 00:16:57.801
Wait. Someone.

00:17:08.222 --> 00:17:09.825
[TOWNSWOMAN E]
I've lost my son!

00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:11.930
He's wearing a Kuma shirt!

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.198
Have you seen him?

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:15.002
Please! Help!

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:19.578
There must be someone who can
help me find my baby! Please!

00:17:19.678 --> 00:17:21.314
Outta my way!

00:17:35.043 --> 00:17:38.583
[TOWNSMAN I] Everybody's
gonna die, no matter what,

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:40.319
it's pointless.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:45.429
[TOWNSMAN I] Even if we run,
we're stuck in the cage.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.135
Doflamingo'll kill us anyway.

00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:52.276
So it's easier to just give up.

00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:12.651
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:18:30.621 --> 00:18:34.193
[TANK clears throat]
King Riku.

00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:48.022
Please, listen well.

00:18:48.122 --> 00:18:54.267
It is I, King--rather, former
king, Riku Doldo the Third.

00:18:57.575 --> 00:18:59.111
[TOWNSMAN O]
What's going on?

00:18:59.211 --> 00:19:00.914
[TOWNSWOMAN G]
It's really him?

00:19:02.818 --> 00:19:05.189
As you can see, yes.

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:06.793
Because of the game that

00:19:06.893 --> 00:19:09.230
the current king Doflamingo
has forced upon us,

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.167
we've been trapped
inside this Birdcage

00:19:11.267 --> 00:19:13.707
with seemingly no escape.

00:19:13.807 --> 00:19:16.613
And, to make matters
even more bleak,

00:19:16.713 --> 00:19:20.887
the cage is rapidly shrinking,
slicing everything in sight.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.199
King Riku.

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:31.341
This was thrust
upon you so suddenly,

00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:34.080
I'm sure your emotions
could barely keep up.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:38.856
And now, you struggle to survive
and protect your loved ones.

00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:45.637
[DOLDO] This may feel like a
nightmare, but it's quite real!

00:19:45.737 --> 00:19:49.077
And this tragedy
did not just begin today!

00:19:49.177 --> 00:19:51.214
Because, for a whole decade,

00:19:51.314 --> 00:19:54.187
Dressrosa was
already a birdcage,

00:19:54.287 --> 00:19:56.425
and all of us were
being held inside

00:19:56.526 --> 00:19:58.863
under the oppressive
reign of pirates!

00:20:04.709 --> 00:20:07.514
[DOLDO] For ten years now,
we have been puppets,

00:20:07.614 --> 00:20:11.555
constantly being manipulated
by the strings that they pulled!

00:20:12.725 --> 00:20:15.531
[DOLDO]
Such has been our reality.

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:17.902
But soon, that is
going to change!

00:20:18.002 --> 00:20:19.270
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.375
[DOLDO]
The feared Don Quixote Family,

00:20:21.475 --> 00:20:23.245
whom we believed
were unstoppable,

00:20:23.345 --> 00:20:26.920
have nearly been eliminated
by a group of mighty warriors

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.693
who only happened to be
passing through our country!

00:20:30.793 --> 00:20:33.933
None of the Executives
are left standing!

00:20:34.033 --> 00:20:35.069
Whoa, really?

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:37.339
Who could do that?

00:20:37.439 --> 00:20:39.244
I dunno, but it wasn't us!

00:20:39.344 --> 00:20:42.150
[DOLDO]
The final obstacle is him!

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.724
The ruthless tyrant who has
Dressrosa under his thumb.

00:20:45.824 --> 00:20:47.861
Doflamingo!

00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:55.777
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:20:57.748 --> 00:21:00.521
[DOLDO] And the brave soul
who's doing battle with him

00:21:00.621 --> 00:21:03.593
is Luffy of the
Straw Hat Pirates!

00:21:03.693 --> 00:21:05.429
I believe he'll save us.

00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:08.536
He'll destroy this Birdcage
once and for all!

00:21:08.636 --> 00:21:12.110
Having been dethroned,
I feel utterly helpless now.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.082
All I can do is stake the
fate of my beloved kingdom

00:21:15.182 --> 00:21:17.921
on some pirate I hardly know.

00:21:18.021 --> 00:21:21.127
However! I must
remind you of one thing!

00:21:21.227 --> 00:21:25.269
That win, or lose,
it'll end in mere minutes!

00:21:25.369 --> 00:21:27.339
So try to survive until then.

00:21:27.439 --> 00:21:30.179
No matter what it takes!

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:32.483
Our dear country
may be crumbling,

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:35.256
but I cannot allow you
to go down with it!

00:21:35.356 --> 00:21:38.563
I implore you to keep running!

00:21:38.663 --> 00:21:42.504
Even if you run out of breath
or your legs are broken!

00:21:42.604 --> 00:21:44.141
For a few minutes.

00:21:44.241 --> 00:21:46.879
Please try to survive!

00:21:54.227 --> 00:21:56.297
There is still hope for us.

00:21:56.397 --> 00:21:59.370
That is why you
mustn't surrender yet!

00:22:07.219 --> 00:22:09.892
We'll do our best alone!

00:22:09.992 --> 00:22:10.894
[NURSES]
Right!

00:22:10.994 --> 00:22:13.331
Good! Let's go! Run!

00:22:13.431 --> 00:22:14.568
[TOWNSGIRL A gasps]

00:22:16.104 --> 00:22:19.076
[TOWNSWOMAN A screams]

00:22:20.847 --> 00:22:22.183
Okay!

00:22:22.283 --> 00:22:23.820
Yeah.

00:22:24.522 --> 00:22:26.526
We should do what
King Riku says!

00:22:26.626 --> 00:22:29.632
Don't give up! Let's all
run downtown together!

00:22:29.732 --> 00:22:31.234
[TOWNSMAN R]
Help the patients!

00:22:31.334 --> 00:22:33.072
[TOWNSMAN S]
Grab the beds!

00:22:33.172 --> 00:22:36.077
[DOCTOR A laughs]

00:22:39.518 --> 00:22:40.820
Here.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.130
[TOWNSBOY A]
Mommy!

00:22:50.172 --> 00:22:53.412
[TOWNSMAN V] We have to survive
until the battle's over!

00:22:53.513 --> 00:22:55.115
That Straw Hat Luffy is going to

00:22:55.215 --> 00:22:58.022
put Doflamingo in
his place, I know it!

00:22:58.122 --> 00:22:59.390
Yeah!

00:23:01.428 --> 00:23:02.831
[chuckles]

00:23:02.931 --> 00:23:04.234
Ha!

00:23:04.334 --> 00:23:06.805
That's it, Mingo!

00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:16.893
[NARRATOR] Using his Devil
Fruit's awakened abilities,

00:23:16.993 --> 00:23:18.797
Doflamingo causes
objects in town

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:20.801
to turn into deadly strings,

00:23:20.901 --> 00:23:23.773
making things even more
dangerous for the civilians.

00:23:23.873 --> 00:23:25.309
With nowhere to run
and the time limit

00:23:25.409 --> 00:23:27.046
of Fourth Gear fast approaching,

00:23:27.146 --> 00:23:30.419
Luffy is forced to make
a deadly charge!

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.922
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.023 --> 00:23:34.662
"Luffy!
An All-Out Leo Bazooka!"

00:23:34.762 --> 00:23:37.667
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
