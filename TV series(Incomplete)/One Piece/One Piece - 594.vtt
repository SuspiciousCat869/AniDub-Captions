â™ª Opening Song

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:39.367
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.328
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.542
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.044
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:53.423
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:55.258
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.635
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:00.555
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:04.976
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.603
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:10.231
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:14.652
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.866
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hat
Pirates reach the New World

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:21.826
and land on Punk Hazard.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.204
After they discover that
the Master of the island,

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:27.707
Caesar Clown, has been
performing terrible experiments,

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.335
they set off to confront him.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.502
Huh?

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:33.004
Work with you?

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:38.426
I've got a plan to
take down an Emperor.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:45.475
[LUFFY] "Formed! Luffy and
Law's Pirate Alliance!"

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:58.071
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
So let me get this straight.

00:03:58.112 --> 00:04:00.198
We meet by chance
on this crazy island

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.492
and you ask us if we
want to fight an Emperor

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:04.077
out of the blue?

00:04:04.118 --> 00:04:06.496
Look, I don't know what
this sleazeball is after,

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:08.039
but I don't trust him!

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.541
He's up to no good, Luffy!

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:18.925
[LAW] I'm not saying killing off
an Emperor will be easy.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.551
I just think our
odds will be better

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:24.430
if we work together and
plan everything step-by-step.

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:25.807
What do ya say?

00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:28.017
This is your big chance.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:30.728
Well, there's four
of 'em, right?

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.272
So which one is it?

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:33.606
"Which one is it"?

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.358
Don't tell me you're
thinking about it!

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.610
We can't team up with him!

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.579
[LAW]
The name of our target...

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.297
[inaudible]

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.025
Right, got it.

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:18.276
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Huh?

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:22.071
Sure. We're in!

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:25.700
Huh? Luffy!

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:37.086
[USOPP, CHOPPER (SANJI)] What?!
Team up with the Heart Pirates?!

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.714
What's the matter with you?!

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.467
Dammit, Luffy, how did you
manage to go completely insane

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:44.052
in the time you were
out saving Nami?

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:46.179
I mean, you weren't
even gone for that long!

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.221
Calm down.

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:49.098
This psycho already
scared the crap out of me,

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.975
now we have to
trust him with our lives?

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:54.312
Now how'm I s'posed to sleep
at night with him around?

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.981
I told you, Luffy.
Let's just forget it.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.149
It's risky.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.568
That's why nobody
is on board with it!

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.612
It's better for us to do
things at our own pace!

00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:05.406
She's right. Besides,
it's way too early

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:07.909
to think about challenging
the Four Emperors.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.119
We're just not ready yet!

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.413
Hey, doc. Fix this raccoon.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:15.917
Raccoons aren't
important right now!

00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.253
[CHOPPER (SANJI) screams]
That's me!

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:23.424
S-Super...

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:27.470
[crying] What did you do to me?

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:30.640
[CHOPPER (SANJI) crying]

00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:35.520
Luffy. I will go along with
this, but we are all pirates.

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:37.522
And where you have
pirates, well,

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:40.274
you're sure to have betrayal.

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:43.861
I'm just concerned because
you're so quick to trust.

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:45.905
Hey. Are you gonna betray me?

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:47.365
No.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.493
The rest of us are gonna
need more than that!

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:51.702
Oh, come on.

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:54.914
A pirate alliance sounds
like a lot of fun, right?

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.834
My gut says Traffy's
an okay guy.

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:01.254
But even if he's not,
what's the big deal?

00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:03.297
You guys were training
for the past two years.

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:06.384
I'll let you
protect me! [laughs]

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.261
[ALL]
Huh?!

00:07:08.302 --> 00:07:10.513
Are you kidding me?

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:15.476
Aw, thank you, Luffy!
Look, now I'm blushing!

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.687
Thanks a lot, buddy.
I'm super flattered!

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:20.940
I promise, we won't
let you down!

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.609
We're only awesome
because it's our job!

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:26.362
There's no need to
butter us up, you know!

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:28.281
Yeah, don't worry, Luffy!

00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:30.825
Whatever happens,
we've got your back!

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.077
And hey, even if these
other wimps chicken out,

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.579
you've always got me.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.665
I knew I could
count on you! [laughs]

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.877
[OTHERS laughing]

00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:43.045
[LUFFY]
This is gonna be fun!

Room.

00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:49.969
And Shambles.

00:07:55.057 --> 00:07:57.727
Ahh! It's about time!

00:07:57.768 --> 00:08:00.730
Man, it's good to be
back in my own body!

00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:04.692
There's nobody else I'd
rather be than me! [chuckles]

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:08.029
Super!

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.323
So you're back. That's great.

00:08:10.364 --> 00:08:15.328
But don't ever take possession
of Chopper's body again. Ever.

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:19.749
I'm back, but I'm not happy.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.834
My body's all busted up now!

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.252
Would it have
killed you big jerks

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:24.962
to be a little more
careful with it?

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:27.757
[LUFFY, FRANKY sigh]
I'm sorry. It was

00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:29.217
--all Franky's fault.
--all Luffy's fault.

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:30.718
It was my fault?

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.346
You're the one who turned into
a monster and flipped out!

00:08:33.387 --> 00:08:35.139
All I did was stop you!

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:38.226
With that same overpowered move
you used to beat that Kraken!

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:39.519
That was overkill!

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.937
Fine, you're both jerks!

00:08:40.978 --> 00:08:43.022
[LUFFY, FRANKY]
Yeah. Sorry, Chopper.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:46.692
[NAMI (SANJI)] Well, at least
you got your own bodies back.

00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:49.737
Why am I the only person
without my own body?

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:52.532
First I was Franky,
now I'm Sanji...

00:08:52.573 --> 00:08:56.786
[LUFFY laughs]
It's even funnier this way!

00:08:56.827 --> 00:08:58.913
[CHOPPER laughs]

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:01.874
Looking good, Nami! [laughs]

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:03.709
Wow, I'm glad
you're enjoying it!

00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.253
Stop laughing!

00:09:05.294 --> 00:09:07.129
But it had to be you!

00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:09.215
Chopper and Franky were
both in the same place

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:11.717
when our scary new friend
switched everyone back.

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:13.678
But since Sanji took
your body with him

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:15.471
when he went looking
for the samurai,

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.431
your heart had
nowhere else to go.

00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:20.851
So, if you're gonna be mad at
someone, it should be Sanji!

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:23.145
You can fix it, can't you?

00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:24.939
Not until your body comes back.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.691
[NAMI (SANJI) gasps]

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.240
[LAW]
So they're all here.

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:37.952
[LUFFY] Mm-hm. And we
gotta help 'em. Somehow.

00:09:46.627 --> 00:09:47.962
[CAESAR CLOWN]
They'll never leave because

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.590
I've been giving them
drugged candies.

00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:52.383
[LAW]
Let's just forget about them.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.926
Too much work.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:55.761
All of 'em are
addicted to drugs.

00:09:55.803 --> 00:09:59.098
[CHOPPER] Yeah, we know that!
I tested them! Poor kids.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.309
I want to take them
all back home,

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.061
but they need to recover
and build up their strength.

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:07.273
I don't know if we can do
anything about their size.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:11.110
It's sad. Who would do this
to a bunch of little kids?

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.029
Well, the World Government,
for one.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.655
For hundreds of years now,

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.407
they've been
conducting experiments

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.327
to try and turn
people into giants.

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:21.454
The Government?

00:10:21.495 --> 00:10:24.040
But why would they do
something like that?

00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:25.666
If I had to take a guess,

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:28.961
then I'd say it's to create
unlimited giant soldiers.

00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:32.173
It's hard to beat
an army like that.

00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:33.424
[NAMI (SANJI) gasps]

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.302
[LAW] Caesar's probably hoping
to figure out how to do it first

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:39.722
so he can beat Vegapunk and
the Government to the punch.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.224
But I don't think
it's that simple.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.688
You sure you want to help them?

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.524
I mean, you don't even know
who these kids are, do ya?

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:54.070
We don't. You're right,
they may be strangers to me,

00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:58.616
but they looked at me with tears
in their eyes, begging for help.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.284
The Master was
able to trick them

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:03.954
into coming to this terrible
place, but once they got here,

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:06.040
it didn't take too
long for them to realize

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.250
that something wasn't right.

00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:13.547
I'm going to make sure
every single one of them

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:14.840
is safe and sound,

00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:18.177
and I won't leave
this island until I do!

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:21.305
If I leave with Luffy,
are you gonna stay here alone?

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.432
Wait, I'm not goin' anywhere.

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:27.937
If this is important to Nami and
Chopper, then I'll stay, too.

00:11:27.978 --> 00:11:31.023
And Sanji wants to put
that samurai back together.

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:32.858
Look, if you're
gonna work with us,

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.152
then get used to helping people!

00:11:36.612 --> 00:11:38.406
[USOPP sighs]

00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:41.283
You have no idea what you're
getting into here, pal.

00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:43.953
Here's the thing.
See, most of the time,

00:11:43.994 --> 00:11:46.163
when you're forming an alliance,
you have a couple of groups

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.832
with a common goal
and you negotiate

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:50.459
the best way to get it done,
does that sound right?

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:51.961
Obviously.

00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:54.088
So you'd think.
But in Luffy's world,

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.841
that logic gets thrown
out the window completely!

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:58.467
Just means I'm friends with you!

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:01.303
Frankly, you can forget about
having any say in what we do!

00:12:01.345 --> 00:12:02.346
It's all up to him!

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:03.848
All up to me!

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.892
As soon as this guy makes up his
mind about something, that's it!

00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:09.520
You're along for the ride
whether you like it or not.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:10.938
If selfishness was a power,

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.190
he'd take out that
Emperor on the spot!

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:15.443
How do you stand me?

00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:16.569
[gasps]

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.447
Look. I understand that
this is what your friends want,

00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:21.198
but that doesn't
concern our plan.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.576
Hey! Stop flicking
your boogers at me!

00:12:23.617 --> 00:12:24.869
That's nasty!

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.538
Just wipe it off! [chuckles]

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.832
[CHOPPER] I can't move
right now, remember?

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:31.459
[LUFFY]
Right, sorry!

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.044
Fine. But we have to hurry up.

00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:36.922
There's no time. Putting
the samurai back together

00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:38.758
can be your group's problem.

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:40.843
But I guess I can go
investigate the drug

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.511
that was given to the children.

00:12:42.553 --> 00:12:44.430
Now who's the ship's
doctor again?

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:45.890
You come with me.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:48.642
We'll do research
behind Caesar's back.

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:53.481
[USOPP]
There, that should do it.

00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:56.942
I'm sorry. It's just,
I can't walk right now.

00:12:56.984 --> 00:12:59.028
I hope you don't mind.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.323
[LUFFY laughs]

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:04.408
Wow, that's a lot
of hats, Traffy!

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:08.162
Sorry for laughing,
but I just...!

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.789
Super cute!

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:10.873
[ROBIN chuckles]

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.666
Careful out there, Chopper.

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:14.668
You can count on me!

00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:23.677
[CENTAURS]
And, push!

00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:26.680
[CENTAURS grunting]

00:13:26.722 --> 00:13:28.432
[CENTAURS]
And, push!

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:34.230
[CENTAURS grunting]

00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:41.654
[CENTAUR A] There we go!
We've unlocked it now!

00:13:41.695 --> 00:13:43.322
And, push!

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:48.410
[CENTAURS grunting]

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.875
This is odd. I wonder
why they keep it in here?

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:08.138
Wait a minute.
What's that there?

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:14.603
[CENTAUR D] It's so dark.
I can't see a thing!

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:21.694
[CENTAUR D groans]

00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:23.153
[CENTAURS gasp]

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:30.202
What the--?

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:46.886
[CENTAURS gasping]

00:15:18.792 --> 00:15:22.504
So, you, uh,
don't talk that much.

00:15:28.552 --> 00:15:30.095
[LAW]
As you could probably all tell

00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:34.224
from those assassins he sent,
Caesar wants to eliminate you,

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:38.103
as well as White Hunter
and the G-5.

00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:40.981
So he can take
the children back.

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:43.275
He's not gonna
stop pursuing you,

00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:46.028
not until he gets
what he's after.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.615
Before the incident four years
ago when he became a criminal,

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:52.159
he was a Government scientist.

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:54.703
Punk Hazard is
restricted territory.

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:56.997
If word gets out that
someone's been living here,

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:59.959
then Caesar will be forced
to leave his perfect hideout.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.170
That's why he'll stop at
nothing to kill all of you.

00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:05.756
This is a guy with
a bounty of 300 million.

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:08.384
Not only did he eat the
Logia-type Gas Gas Fruit,

00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:11.387
he's also got weapons
of mass destruction.

00:16:11.428 --> 00:16:14.723
Caesar Clown is a force
to be reckoned with.

00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:18.769
[NAMI (SANJI)]
300 million?

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:22.022
Those of you who can't use Haki
should steer clear of him.

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:24.024
He's extremely tough.

00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:26.276
Well, we do have
some Haki users.

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:28.654
There's me, Zoro, and Sanji.

00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:29.780
Oh, and you.

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.490
Yeah, that should be enough.

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:33.325
I'll head over to the lab now.

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.576
Be careful out there.

00:16:34.618 --> 00:16:37.871
Sure! So we're supposed to
kidnap this Master guy, right?

00:16:37.913 --> 00:16:39.415
That's the quickest
way to do this?

00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:40.958
[LAW]
Yeah, that's right.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.378
Wait. What good will it
do us to kidnap Caesar?

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.632
Money? Well, no. That's not it.
Caesar's their boss.

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:51.218
That's true, there wouldn't be
anybody to pay his ransom.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.430
What we're after
is chaos, not money.

00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:56.015
[NAMI (SANJI), FRANKY, ROBIN]
Huh?

00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:57.016
Chaos?

00:16:57.057 --> 00:16:58.642
Sorry, I don't get it.

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:00.561
No point in explaining this now.

00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:04.064
We can worry about what lies
ahead when the time comes.

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:08.402
For right now, it's better to
focus on capturing Caesar Clown.

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:10.362
It won't be easy.

00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:12.948
As soon as that's done,

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.076
I'll explain the whole
plan to you in detail.

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:17.411
That said...

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:19.955
Once we get our
hands on Caesar...

00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:24.168
[LAW] ...that's going to
set everything in motion.

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:25.419
So be ready.

00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:27.629
There's no turning back.

00:17:29.798 --> 00:17:31.592
Last chance to change your mind.

00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:33.093
It's up to you, Straw Hat.

00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:35.763
Oh, don't worry.
I'm still with ya!

00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:37.264
Well, all right.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:40.476
Then I'm more than willing
to cooperate with you.

00:17:40.517 --> 00:17:43.604
You just need to make sure
your crew's on board, too.

00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:45.856
Uh-huh! Sure thing!

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:50.360
[gunshots]

00:17:52.112 --> 00:17:54.907
[MARINE A yells]
Die!

00:17:59.995 --> 00:18:01.872
[TASHIGI (SMOKER)]
That's "Rebar" Smoothie!

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:04.124
And Fen Bock of the Gourd!

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.839
[TASHIGI (SMOKER)]
Rope Tugging Chappe, too!

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.050
I though so! These people.

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:15.886
As it turns out,
they're all former prisoners!

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:18.806
They just look
a little bit different now.

00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:25.437
[SMOKER (TASHIGI)]
I think you're right.

00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:27.064
But what's going on?

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.649
The report said
everyone was killed

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.068
during the incident
four years ago!

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.445
[CENTAURS yelling]

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:42.996
Smokey! Why do they
all look like that?

00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:45.874
I don't know! Who gives
a damn what they look like,

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:48.710
just keep holdin'
'em back, would ya?

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:52.798
[SMOKER (TASHIGI)]
We can't send out a signal.

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:56.135
[SMOKER (TASHIGI)]
Until we get to sea!

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:59.638
[CENTAUR L]
Fire!

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.481
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A ringing]

00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:13.318
[SUBORDINATE A]
Master, you have a call. Sir?

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.237
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Oh, let it ring.

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:17.614
I'm sure it's something
along the lines of,

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:20.909
"We opened the door and
something terrible was inside!

00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:23.162
It's killing our
comrades left and right!

00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:26.748
Oh, Master, please help us!"
et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.376
Why would I want
to listen to that?

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:31.712
I never imagined this
island would be graced with

00:19:31.753 --> 00:19:33.463
so many visitors.

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:36.800
There's no need to collect
any more test subjects.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.427
[SUBORDINATE A gasps]

00:19:38.468 --> 00:19:41.680
[CENTAUR A panting]

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:51.607
[CENTAUR A]
Hello? Master? Master!

00:19:51.648 --> 00:19:55.611
[CENTAUR A panting]
Please pick up, quick!

00:19:55.652 --> 00:19:57.237
We did what you told us!

00:19:57.279 --> 00:20:00.574
We opened up that big door
in the Burning Lands!

00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:05.037
No good! The Master
won't answer me!

00:20:05.078 --> 00:20:08.332
[CENTAUR E gasps]
Oh no. It's catching up to us!

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:11.251
What the hell? How far
can that crazy thing run?

00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:12.920
[CENTAUR A] I don't know,
but I don't want to die

00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:14.713
like everyone else!

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:19.009
[CENTAUR E]
Where to?

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:20.594
[CENTAUR A]
This way!

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:40.697
[CENTAURS panting]

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:47.579
[CENTAURS scream]

00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:01.176
We're done for!

00:21:01.218 --> 00:21:04.179
That thing's so huge,
we're never gonna get away!

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:07.766
[CENTAURS scream]

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:32.207
No, please!
Please don't kill me!

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:35.544
Master, why?

00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:49.141
[CENTAURS coughing, groaning]

00:21:49.182 --> 00:21:50.600
Oh yes, that's right.

00:21:50.642 --> 00:21:53.270
You don't know my pet, do you?

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:55.147
It's a rare specimen.

00:21:55.188 --> 00:21:58.150
Its body is made
of deadly slime.

00:21:58.191 --> 00:22:01.028
[CENTAURS groaning]

00:22:01.069 --> 00:22:03.780
Master...!

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:06.241
[CAESAR CLOWN]
It can be a bit much.

00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:10.203
But I can't allow anyone
to leave this island!

00:22:11.204 --> 00:22:15.917
[CENTAURS coughing]

00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:20.630
[laughs]

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:27.054
How does it feel to be set
free after so long, Smiley?

00:23:18.188 --> 00:23:20.190
[NARRATOR] As the shocking
truth behind Caesar's

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:22.234
chemical weapons
of mass destruction

00:23:22.275 --> 00:23:23.902
is gradually revealed,

00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:26.571
the Straw Hats set out to
capture the mad scientist

00:23:26.613 --> 00:23:28.824
and put an end to his plans.

00:23:28.865 --> 00:23:30.951
But thanks to Luffy's
course of action,

00:23:30.992 --> 00:23:33.912
the situation takes
an unexpected turn.

00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:35.664
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:39.918
"Capture M! The Pirate
Alliance's Operation Launches!"

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.838
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
