1
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:43,408
[GOLD ROGER] The world.
What a glorious place!

2
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:48,788
Seek freedom and it will lie
stretched out before your eyes.

3
00:00:48,872 --> 00:00:53,293
If the endless dream guides
your restless spirit, seize it!

4
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:56,963
Raise your flag, and stand tall!

5
00:00:57,672 --> 00:01:01,885
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)</i>

6
00:01:01,968 --> 00:01:05,055
<i>I think back to the time</i>
<i>when my search first began--</i>

7
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:07,432
<i>I left behind those</i>
<i>shores of sand--</i>

8
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:11,978
<i>For the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

9
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:14,939
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

10
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:17,233
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

11
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:25,533
<i>See the light I have searched</i>
<i>for everywhere (ere-ere!)</i>

12
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:28,036
<i>When the summer sun is shining,</i>

13
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:30,663
<i>shaking the sails</i>
<i>of my heart, I know...</i>

14
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:35,669
<i>(Fly away glum blue sea)</i>

15
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:38,088
<i>A brand-new world</i>
<i>that had been hiding</i>

16
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:40,715
<i>has opened up its</i>
<i>doors for me to go...</i>

17
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,095
<i>(Fly away glum blue sky)</i>

18
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:47,639
<i>Swaying in the troubled waves--</i>

19
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:50,100
<i>From all despair,</i>
<i>I can be saved--</i>

20
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:53,395
<i>For the horizon</i>
<i>on the other side is--</i>

21
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:55,647
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</i>

22
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,732
<i>Is what I aim for!</i>

23
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:00,777
<i>And though I've traveled far</i>
<i>from where my search began--</i>

24
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,279
<i>Over seas of green</i>
<i>and shores of sand--</i>

25
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:07,992
<i>Through the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

26
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:10,787
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

27
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,081
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

28
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:18,169
<i>See the light I have</i>
<i>searched for everywhere!</i>

29
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:28,138
[NARRATOR] Luffy and his crew
have finally arrived in Skypiea.

30
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:29,764
However, following
a confrontation

31
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:33,018
with the local authorities,
Nami, Zoro, Robin, and Chopper

32
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:36,438
have been carried away to
face judgment in Upper Yard.

33
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:38,690
In pursuit of their friends,
Luffy and the others

34
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:42,068
must now face the dangers
of the forbidden land.

35
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:43,820
[USOPP screams]

36
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:45,739
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

37
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:48,700
...Bazooka!

38
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:50,285
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, Zoro and his group

39
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,996
have their own problems
at the sacrificial altar.

40
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,582
[ZORO]
I am so done with you!

41
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:58,084
And what about his priests,
you gonna beat them up, too?

42
00:02:58,168 --> 00:03:00,962
Hello? The last thing we need
is you pissing off a God!

43
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:02,881
It's kinda not smart.

44
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:05,717
[ZORO]
By the time I'm done with him,

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,845
this "God" is gonna
bow before me.

46
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,389
[NARRATOR] Zoro, Nami, and Robin
have now made their way

47
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:15,310
into the forest, leaving
Chopper to repair the ship.

48
00:03:15,393 --> 00:03:19,981
[CHOPPER]
Oh, no! Who's gonna protect me?!

49
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:27,822
[LUFFY] "10% Survival Rate!
Satori, the Mantra Master!"

50
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:42,003
Enough is enough.
Where is this "God"?

51
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:43,046
It may not matter.

52
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:44,464
If he really is a God,

53
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:48,093
chances are he knows
exactly where we are.

54
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:49,636
Well, if he would
just come to us,

55
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:52,931
I could get this
thing over with.

56
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:55,642
[NAMI] You say that because you
haven't seen the things I have.

57
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:57,936
There is someone or
something on this island

58
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,563
with the ability to destroy us.

59
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:08,697
O powerful one,
we're but simple sailors.

60
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,323
Please leave us in peace.

61
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:11,825
Oh!

62
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:14,202
And also, please help us find
lots and lots of treasure.

63
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:16,287
Nice prayer, Nami.

64
00:04:19,582 --> 00:04:21,418
Look, you can sit on your
knees all day if you want,

65
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:23,420
but it's not gonna
get us outta here.

66
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:26,381
I say we cross the river and
see what's on the other side.

67
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:27,966
[ROBIN]
Yes, I agree.

68
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:29,968
[NAMI] And how do you plan
to get across this time?

69
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:31,553
I don't see any vines handy.

70
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:34,347
Hey, Zoro, maybe you could
throw Robin across and she--

71
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,726
[screams]

72
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:47,193
[ZORO]
Those things are everywhere!

73
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:48,653
[NAMI] If you think
I'm crossing that now,

74
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:50,238
you're outta your mind!

75
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:54,325
We may as well just hop in and
give the sharks a free snack.

76
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,744
Calm down, it'll be fine.

77
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:57,078
We'll just keep walkin' upstream

78
00:04:57,162 --> 00:05:00,040
and hope we find a safe
place to cross over.

79
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:02,000
Give up! I'm not going!

80
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,711
If you wanna go so badly,
just leave me here.

81
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:06,379
[ZORO]
Ugh. I just might!

82
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:09,466
If you're so scared, why'd you
even come in the first place?

83
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:11,009
[BOTH growling]

84
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:14,512
Hey, guys. Look at this.

85
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:16,806
[NAMI]
Look at what, exactly?

86
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:19,476
It's dirt.

87
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:22,729
Yeah. Am I missing something?
Of course it's dirt.

88
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:25,857
This is a sky island.

89
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,152
You're right.
The ground's not fluffy.

90
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:31,196
Huh? Oh, right!

91
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,947
I almost forgot, I noticed
that the first time

92
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:34,449
I saw this island.

93
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,076
Sky islands are made of clouds.

94
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,953
It feels like it's been a year
since I've touched dirt.

95
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:41,623
So why's this island
different from the others?

96
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:43,958
Not sure, but the fact
that it is different

97
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:46,044
might be what makes
this place so special.

98
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:49,130
At any rate, it's reason
enough to start exploring.

99
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:59,140
Prepare for judgment, criminals.

100
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:01,893
You have no choice
but to receive it.

101
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:07,107
Select a gate.
Select from four ordeals.

102
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:11,444
For you, there can be
no turning back.

103
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:17,242
You may choose your own trial,
but we will decide your fate.

104
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:20,620
[GEDATZ]
Swamp!

105
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:22,872
[SHURA]
Iron!

106
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,457
[OHM]
String!

107
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,210
[SATORI]
Spheres!

108
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,716
[GEDATZ, SHURA, OHM, SATORI]
Choose your path, criminals!

109
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:35,176
So what do we do?

110
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,345
Um, let's go with spheres.

111
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:38,471
Why do you like that one?

112
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:40,056
[LUFFY]
Spheres are like balls, right?

113
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,765
Sounds fun.

114
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,017
That's your only reason?

115
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,477
They're ordeals, they're
not supposed to be fun!

116
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:46,563
Not that I'm
disagreeing with you.

117
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:50,442
Spheres is definitely the one
that doesn't sound too violent.

118
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,110
At least to me.

119
00:06:52,193 --> 00:06:54,904
I mean, all swamp
makes me think is...

120
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:58,783
[USOPP] Help! I'm sinking!
Somebody help!

121
00:06:59,868 --> 00:07:01,536
And I'm talkin' 'bout
the kind of "sinking"

122
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:03,538
you don't come back up from.

123
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:05,373
[LUFFY]
Okay, so what about iron?

124
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,792
[USOPP]
Ah! They're gonna smash us!

125
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:09,961
[screaming]

126
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:12,547
No thank you! Way too scary!

127
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,758
[LUFFY]
Fine! String, then.

128
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:17,427
[USOPP] This isn't so bad.
One hand in front of the other.

129
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,970
[screams]

130
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:21,931
[USOPP]
Where's the ground?

131
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:23,183
No way.

132
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:25,977
It sounds so harmless,
it's probably the worst!

133
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:33,943
Big ball! Incoming!

134
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:35,695
[USOPP]
Splat.

135
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:36,946
Come to think of it,

136
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,783
spheres doesn't sound
all that safe either.

137
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:42,160
Maybe we should
think this over.

138
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:44,120
[SANJI] We don't have time
for a debate here.

139
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:45,497
We're right on top of it.

140
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,874
[LUFFY]
All right, spheres it is!

141
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,630
Okay.

142
00:07:53,713 --> 00:07:56,049
I guess we'll have to trust
Luffy's instincts on this one.

143
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:59,010
Then it's decided. Just don't
let your guard down, guys.

144
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:00,887
Remember, these
are God's Islands,

145
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,641
10,000 meters above sea level--
anything can happen.

146
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:06,893
Ready! Let's do this!

147
00:08:15,652 --> 00:08:16,986
[chuckles]

148
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,532
Driver, would you mind
not shutting your eyes?

149
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:24,869
[USOPP] No. It's just as
dark with them open.

150
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:27,414
[LUFFY] Hey, guys, what if this
is like one of those games?

151
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:28,665
[USOPP]
Like a what?

152
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:29,791
[LUFFY] You know,
if you pick the right door

153
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:31,251
then you get a prize.

154
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:32,752
But if you pick the wrong one--

155
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:35,338
What are you talking about?
What if we picked wrong?

156
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:38,049
Why couldn't you have
mentioned this before, Luffy?

157
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:40,176
Well, let's see here. Um...

158
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,264
If you pick the wrong one...
then you fall off the island!

159
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:46,683
[USOPP] How can you say
something so stupid?!

160
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:49,519
We're thousands of
meters in the air!

161
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:51,062
I don't know how
many times your life

162
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:53,314
can flash before your eyes
during a fall like that,

163
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:55,066
and I don't wanna know!

164
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,569
[SANJI]
You guys are both being idiots.

165
00:08:57,652 --> 00:08:59,696
Nothing like that's gonna--

166
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:18,048
[ALL screaming]

167
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:22,469
[USOPP]
You've gotta be kidding me!

168
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:41,154
[SANJI]
We're alive?

169
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:42,989
I seriously thought
we were falling

170
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:44,741
all the way back
to the Blue Sea.

171
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:46,701
[LUFFY laughing]

172
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,411
That's because somebody
had to make up

173
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:50,538
a lame story to scare us!

174
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:53,375
I was scared! I thought
I was a goner, too!

175
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,461
[LUFFY laughing]

176
00:09:58,713 --> 00:10:01,132
All right, so what
is this place?

177
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:03,885
A forest. With balls.

178
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:13,269
[SANJI] They're balls
made of Island Cloud.

179
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:14,896
[LUFFY]
Ha! Awesome!

180
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:17,107
They look like really
big snowflakes.

181
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,942
Now what could be
scary about that?

182
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:21,069
See, Usopp? It's okay.

183
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:26,366
Heads up, the Milky Road is
leading us up into the trees.

184
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:29,619
I just don't see how this
is an ordeal. Do you?

185
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:31,371
[SANJI]
Not yet.

186
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:33,081
It'd be great if there
was nothing ahead,

187
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:35,166
but somehow I doubt it.

188
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,918
[LUFFY] What if it was
like one of those games,

189
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:38,128
and we picked the right door,

190
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:39,713
and now all we have
to do is float around

191
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:42,090
in this giant snow
looking for the others?

192
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:46,469
[USOPP]
Y-Y-Yeah! M-Maybe that's it!

193
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:47,846
You're still being idiots.

194
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:49,014
They think we're criminals,

195
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:51,516
I doubt they'll let
us off that easy.

196
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,685
Use your brains for once.

197
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:54,936
I wouldn't be surprised

198
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,564
if there were more traps
like the ones earlier.

199
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:59,566
We have to stay sharp.

200
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:02,861
[SANJI]
Let's just keep moving.

201
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,320
[LUFFY]
What, are you the captain now?

202
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:05,655
Can we at least have a snack?

203
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:09,034
[USOPP] Ooh! Yeah!
Whatcha got in your bag, Sanji?

204
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:10,243
[LUFFY]
Come on, gimme!

205
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:11,661
[SANJI]
No! No snacks!

206
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:13,830
[LUFFY] But, Sanji, we need
to keep our strength up!

207
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:14,956
[USOPP]
Just a little somethin'?

208
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,499
[SANJI]
I said no!

209
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,877
Now listen, it's really simple:
I'm going to keep steering,

210
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,004
you guys keep watch
out the sides.

211
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:22,756
[LUFFY, USOPP groan]

212
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:29,637
Whoa. I didn't realize how
high up we were getting!

213
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,431
[SANJI]
Something's not right.

214
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:32,932
It's too quiet.

215
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:34,184
There are four priests,

216
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:36,436
so I assumed each
tunnel would lead to one.

217
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,230
Why haven't we seen
any of them yet?

218
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:41,149
I got a bad feeling about this.

219
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:43,651
[LUFFY]
Hey, Usopp! Catch!

220
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:46,738
Okay, I got it,
I got it. Pass!

221
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:48,823
I thought I told you
to keep watch!

222
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:50,408
[USOPP, LUFFY groan]

223
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:52,994
[USOPP, LUFFY scream]

224
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:54,329
A snake!

225
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:57,290
Stupid... snake ball!

226
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:05,340
Okay, didn't see that coming.

227
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:08,343
Ah! Sanji! Cloud ball!

228
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:09,844
Kick it away!

229
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:13,473
I do not like the idea of
being surrounded by snake eggs.

230
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:33,118
[ALL]
This can't be good.

231
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:37,789
[USOPP] For cryin' out loud!
What's with these things?

232
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:39,582
[USOPP crying]

233
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,334
[SATORI laughs]

234
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:45,380
[SATORI] Silly children,
these are Surprise Clouds.

235
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,427
[SATORI] You never know what's
going to come out of them.

236
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,679
Hey? Where's that
voice coming from?

237
00:12:52,762 --> 00:12:54,931
[SATORI]
Ha-ha! Heso!

238
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:56,224
Who--?

239
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:59,978
I'm so glad you picked
my challenge--

240
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:01,980
the Ordeal of Spheres!

241
00:13:02,063 --> 00:13:04,816
[laughigng]

242
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,235
[SANJI] Yeah, is that
a talking dumpling?

243
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:09,279
[USOPP]
Eh. Uhh...

244
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:27,422
[SATORI laughing]

245
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:30,800
This guy is one of
Eneru's priests?

246
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:33,511
[SATORI laughing]

247
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,472
[LUFFY]
That's the ordeal? Ball guy?

248
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:38,933
Stop with the dancing!
And tell us who you are!

249
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:42,312
[laughing]

250
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:45,023
Gotta say, he's not as
bright as I expected.

251
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:47,692
Didn't Nami and the old guy
say these priests were strong?

252
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:49,110
'Cause I'm not seein' it.

253
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:52,155
[SATORI laughing]

254
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:53,823
[SANJI]
Hey! Dumpling!

255
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:56,534
Nami and the others
better be safe!

256
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,161
[SATORI]
The sacrifices?

257
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:01,206
They'll escape or they won't.
Doesn't really matter which.

258
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:02,707
If they escape, they'll die.

259
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,877
If they're sacrificed,
well, they'll die then, too.

260
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,337
What's that mean?

261
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,422
[SATORI] But I'd be more
worried about yourselves.

262
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:12,092
You'll have to beat me if you
plan on going any further.

263
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:14,177
And I really don't see
that happening.

264
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,681
[SATORI laughing]

265
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:20,350
He's comin' right for
us, Luffy! Get him!

266
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:22,727
I hope you're ready for this!

267
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:24,437
Gum-Gum...

268
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:27,065
Ooh! You gonna stretch?

269
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,735
...Pistol!

270
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:35,490
[laughs]

271
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:44,249
[LUFFY yelling]

272
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,711
[USOPP]
No way!

273
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,129
Luffy!

274
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:00,432
[USOPP]
Luffy!

275
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:02,100
You're okay, aren't you?

276
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:04,769
A hit like that couldn't
have hurt you that much!

277
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:05,979
[SATORI]
Well, you see,

278
00:15:06,062 --> 00:15:10,233
it's not what you'd
call a... normal hit.

279
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:12,193
I'll show you not normal!

280
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:14,404
[SATORI]
Right foot, high kick.

281
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:16,281
Boulette-- Uh.

282
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:18,241
[SATORI]
Only the most well-trained

283
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:20,410
are granted the power of...

284
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:21,911
..."Mantra."

285
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:23,204
[SANJI]
Impossible!

286
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,206
How could he have
predicted my attack?

287
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,208
Ah!

288
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:39,512
No! Sanji!

289
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:42,265
[SATORI]
I warned you, didn't I?

290
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:43,767
Impact!

291
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,482
The shock destroys the
body from the inside out.

292
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:59,074
[LUFFY]
Sanji. Usopp.

293
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,160
[SANJI]
Yeah, I'm fine.

294
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:05,372
Ugh. What did that
bastard do to us?

295
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:07,040
I got no idea.

296
00:16:07,123 --> 00:16:08,750
Who is this guy anyway?

297
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,793
[laughs]

298
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:11,169
My name is Satori.

299
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:13,922
I am one of the four priests
of the almighty Eneru,

300
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:15,340
who watch over Upper Yard

301
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:17,967
and see to the judgment of
criminals like yourselves.

302
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:20,762
I own the vearth
in this Lost Forest.

303
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:22,514
The Lost Forest?

304
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:24,516
Why, yes.

305
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:28,353
My forest, in all its glory.

306
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:29,979
And now...

307
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:35,193
...your boat will be
lost in its illusions!

308
00:16:35,276 --> 00:16:38,071
Ah! We're using that!

309
00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:41,157
[SATORI] She will now speed
along the Milky Road,

310
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:45,286
eventually weaving her way
to this forest's only exit!

311
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,872
I'm sure I don't
need to tell you this,

312
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:50,375
but if you lose a
dial boat in here,

313
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:55,588
it's the same as losing your
way to the sacrificial altar.

314
00:16:55,672 --> 00:16:57,549
That means you will
have to find the boat

315
00:16:57,632 --> 00:16:59,634
and board her
before that happens.

316
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,470
Of course, my hundreds
of Surprise Clouds and I

317
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,932
will never allow
you that chance.

318
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:08,727
Does that seem unfair
to you boys?

319
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,770
Welcome to the Upper Yard!

320
00:17:10,854 --> 00:17:13,815
[SATORI laughing]

321
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:17,235
The Ordeal of Spheres.

322
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:20,905
There's a ten percent
survival rate, so good luck.

323
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:25,285
Survival rate. Just ten percent?

324
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:34,252
[SATORI laughing]

325
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:38,965
[CHOPPER wailing]

326
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:42,927
Zoro! Nami! Robin!

327
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:44,971
Why did you leave me all alone?

328
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:49,559
Please come back! I don't
wanna stay here by myself!

329
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:52,354
What will happen if I'm
attacked now? I can't fight!

330
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:55,690
There'll be no one
here to save me.

331
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,192
Huh?

332
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:59,444
[screams]

333
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:04,741
This is all because of Luffy.

334
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:07,035
If he hadn't wanted to
come to Skypeia so bad,

335
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:08,787
then I wouldn't be stuck here.

336
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,871
[gasps]

337
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:11,247
[ZORO]
You guys can keep a lookout.

338
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:13,917
I'm sure Luffy and the others
are headed this way.

339
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,880
That's right. Luffy and
the others are coming here.

340
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:27,347
So, really, all I have to do is
stay alive until they show up!

341
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,683
It shouldn't be long now
before they get here.

342
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:31,351
I just need to keep busy.

343
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:32,727
I know!

344
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,771
I'll work on fixing the ship
like Zoro asked me to.

345
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:36,439
I can do that.

346
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:42,821
[chuckles]

347
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:45,115
They'll be so surprised
when they see how well

348
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:47,534
I'm taking care
of the ship all alone.

349
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:50,537
[chuckles]

350
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,541
[CHOPPER screams]

351
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:03,174
[CHOPPER]
The hammer!

352
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:06,970
I-I have to get it back.

353
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:09,931
Aww... Oh, dear.

354
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:16,855
[SATORI laughing]

355
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:18,773
[SATORI] You boys had better
catch her pretty soon.

356
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,817
She's getting away.

357
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,277
He's right, you guys.

358
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,739
We need to get moving now,
before we lose sight of her.

359
00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:27,574
Ugh. If we lose her
in this forest,

360
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:29,868
finding her again
could be impossible.

361
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:33,038
Usopp, wait. Finding each
other won't be easy either.

362
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:34,581
Luffy, you coming?

363
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:37,000
You two go on ahead without me.

364
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:40,920
I'm gonna take care of ball guy.

365
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:43,590
Ha-ha! This should be amusing.

366
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:47,761
Do you really think you can
beat me, rubber boy? Ha-ha!

367
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:49,220
[SANJI]
I guess someone needs to deal

368
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:51,931
with this potbellied freak.

369
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:53,224
[SANJI]
Don't do anything reckless.

370
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:54,768
He has weird powers.

371
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:56,394
Back as soon as we get the boat!

372
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:57,604
[LUFFY]
Great.

373
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:02,442
It's just you and me now, fatso.

374
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:03,610
[laughs]

375
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:05,820
He'll grab that branch.

376
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,368
And Gum-Gum...

377
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:13,328
Same move as before.

378
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:16,331
[LUFFY]
...Pistol!

379
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,709
[gasps]

380
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:20,919
[SATORI laughs]

381
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:27,008
[LUFFY screaming]

382
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,810
[laughs]

383
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:39,688
What's the matter? I thought you
were going to take care of me.

384
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:43,400
I am. I said I would, didn't I?

385
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:52,367
And this time I won't
miss! Gum-Gum...

386
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,620
He'll feign a punch,
but follow with a kick!

387
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:56,579
[LUFFY]
...Whip!

388
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:58,665
[SATORI laughs]

389
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:00,834
And again!

390
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:02,711
[SATORI laughs]

391
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,296
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

392
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:13,680
[groaning]

393
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:28,820
[LUFFY screaming]

394
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:37,579
[laughing]

395
00:21:37,662 --> 00:21:42,667
[USOPP panting]

396
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:47,339
Where is she? Where's the Crow?

397
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:50,592
If we don't get her back,
we'll be stuck here forever!

398
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:56,431
[USOPP] I can't see
anything from down here.

399
00:21:58,475 --> 00:22:00,143
Up I go!

400
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,313
[SANJI]
Watch yourself, Luffy!

401
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:05,732
These priests are
far from ordinary.

402
00:22:05,815 --> 00:22:08,068
Now to find the boat,
and get the hell outta here.

403
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:09,527
Fast!

404
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,202
[LUFFY]
Darn it! My head's stuck!

405
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:19,412
[laughs]

406
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:21,164
Aren't you stubborn?

407
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:38,932
<i>Even if, there are times</i>
<i>when we are far apart</i>

408
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:45,397
<i>Through it all, remember</i>
<i>I'll be there in your heart</i>

409
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,316
<i>And on days when</i>
<i>you start to cry</i>

410
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,069
<i>You know you'll always have</i>

411
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:54,948
<i>Someone who's there at your side</i>

412
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:59,994
<i>To wipe all the tears away</i>

413
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,915
<i>We will never yield</i>

414
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:05,792
<i>We won't back down</i>

415
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:09,087
<i>We'll keep our dreams alive</i>

416
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:15,593
<i>They'll never change</i>
<i>the way we feel inside</i>

417
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:19,055
<i>And the light that</i>
<i>shines eternally</i>

418
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:22,475
<i>So many tried to grasp</i>

419
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:30,358
<i>Will someday be held</i>
<i>within our hands at last</i>

420
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:44,914
[USOPP] Aw, man! It looks like
we're going to lose the boat!

421
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:48,043
[LUFFY] This ball guy is tough!
And what's with these clouds?

422
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,961
Fighting on sky
islands is weird!

423
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:52,088
[SANJI] This is no time
for crappy ordeals!

424
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:53,757
We've got to save
Nami and Robin!

425
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,886
[CHOPPER]
Zoro! Nami! Robin!

426
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,637
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

427
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,306
"The Ordeal of Spheres!

428
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:03,850
Desperate Struggle
in the Lost Forest!"

429
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:06,436
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
