As long as there are people

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,463
these things shall not
vanish from the earth!

5
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,273
<i>People tell me my</i>
<i>head's in the clouds</i>

6
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,574
<i>I don't care what they say</i>

7
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,410
<i>because I'm dreamin' of you</i>

8
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,379
<i>You are the treasure I've found</i>

9
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,115
<i>So bright, so bold,</i>
<i>yet so elusive</i>

10
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,618
<i>It's hard to look away,</i>

11
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,721
<i>even though it's blinding me</i>

12
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,389
<i>There are no words to describe</i>

13
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,291
<i>how I feel inside</i>

14
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,661

00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,296

00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:08,234
<i>And I won't stop 'til I</i>

18
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,402
<i>You're all I need</i>

19
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,571
<i>to have the strength to believe</i>

20
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:17,677
<i>Believe in Wonderland!</i>

21
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,815

00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,483
<i>however crazy they seem</i>

23
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,118
<i>I'm gonna share them with you,</i>

24
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,653
<i>a love so true</i>

25
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:30,190
<i>You're all I want,</i>

00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,659

00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,294
<i>There is no limit to us,</i>

28
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,762
<i>we have the power of love</i>

29
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:39,132
<i>And we don't wanna</i>
<i>live ordinary lives</i>

30
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,535
<i>We have the chance</i>

31

<i>Believe in Wonderland!</i>

32
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,719
Listen! I'm the man who'll
be King of the Pirates!

33
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,022
[NAMI] I saw a massive cumulus
cloud in the eastern sky!

34
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,726
That means an unimaginably big
storm is headed our way.

35
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,397
[ZORO]
Outta our way!

36
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,170
But... I'm dead.

37
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,192
[laughing]

38
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:43,163
I'm still alive! That's nice!

39
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,700
Is this just mere coincidence?

40
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,505
It's as if heaven itself
has special plans

41
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,841
for this young pirate.

42
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,377
[ZORO] We'd better pick up
the pace or we're toast!

43
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,212
[LUFFY] We're gonna get to
the Grand Line! I know it!

44
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,781
[laughing]

45
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:06,085

Head for the Grand Line!"

50
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,755
The Pirate King... Fine by me.

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,295
What the hell is up
with all this rain?

52
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,763
Nami was right about this storm.

53
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,233
If we don't get back to
the ship and set sail soon,

54
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,934
we're going to be
stuck here for good.

55
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,270
Run! Just keep on running!

56
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,305
[LUFFY laughing]

57
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,742
[CABAJI]
My Carnival of Colors!

58
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,488
You're wasting your time,
you silly little man.

59
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,823
There isn't anybody alive

60
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:20,660
who can lay a hand on this
perfectly smooth skin.

61
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,366
That was weird.
I saw a field of flowers.

62
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,635
Captain Buggy, you're
not fried to a crisp.

63
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,636
I don't die!

64
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:30,603
This isn't good, Buggy.

65
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,305
They're sending Marines
from headquarters.

66
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,640
They'll never stop.

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,707
Heh. I don't care.

68
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,811
They can stick their noses‐‐
Don't let me say noses!

69
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,313
My bad...

70
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,784
What now?

71
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,519
We go after that
little rubber twerp.

72
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,688
Mohji and Richie are burning
his ship as we speak

73
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,390
so he's got no place
he can run to

74
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,824
so all that's left for us to do

75
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,827
is do what Buggy Pirates
do best, kick his ass.

76
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:55,728
[PIRATES]
Yeah!

77
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,497
Ha‐ha! Motor!

78
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,332
[PIRATES]
Yes, Captain.

79
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,202
Chop‐Chop Buggy.

80
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,571
Bomb Engine Ignite!

81
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,509
Set the ramp! Now!

82
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,210
[PIRATES]
Right! Ramp is set!

83
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,646
[ALVIDA]
No friction.

84
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,850
[ALVIDA]
Smooth‐Smooth Tracks!

85
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,523
[BUGGY laughing]

86
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,359
[MARINE C]
Don't let those pirates escape!

87
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,500
[ALVIDA]
Where'd this smoke come from?

88
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,504
What is it?

89
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,406
White Out time!

90
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,913
[BUGGY]
Smoker!

91
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,717
[SMOKER] I can't waste my time
with you little fools!

92
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,951
[TOWNSMAN 1]
He's so strong!

93
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,853
[TOWNSWOMAN 1] So that's the
power of the Plume Plume Fruit.

94
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:57,256
[TOWNSMAN 2] He took out Buggy's
entire crew just like that!

95
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,892
Fire!

96
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,801
[BUGGY]
Smoker, you bastard!

97
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,372
[ALVIDA] I can't break free
of this horrible steel net.

98
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,407
Where'd they get
a gun like that?

99
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,409
It's a "Cage Shot"
developed by the Marines

100
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,444
to deal with Devil Fruit powers.

101
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,912
Cowards.

102
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,749
I'll get the Straw Hat.

103
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,283
Bring my billower bike.

104
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,551
Sir.

105
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,620
[USOPP]
This is heavy.

106
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,455
They're going to be
after the Going Merry.

107
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,324
The Marines might even
already be there.

108
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,427
We've gotta get back to the ship
as soon as possible, Usopp!

109
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,995
[USOPP] Nami, can't we
just drop the fish?

110
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,897
[NAMI]
No, just try to keep up.

111
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,299
[USOPP]
I knew you'd say that!

112
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,303
[MOHJI]
Dammit.

113
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,672
Crap, why did it have to
start storming now?

114
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,909
How am I supposed to burn down
this ship when it's wet?

115
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,344
Ah!

116
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,812
Ugh!

117
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,781
Aww, man! Richie,
we're gonna get in big trouble

118
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,916
if we can't get a fire
going in this rain.

119
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,618
One more try.

120
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,589
[MOHJI] Relax, Richie,
I'll feed you in a minute.

121
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,658
[sighs]

122
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,794
[USOPP]
What are you doing?

123
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,129
[NAMI]
Mohji!

124
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,800
Heh. Well, if it isn't
the little thief.

125
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,968
Go, Richie!

126
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,338
[yelping]

127
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,378
Special Attack! Fresh Egg Star!

128
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,321
Damn rain.
It made my hand slip.

129
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,494
[MOHJI]
Richie! I'll feed you later!

130
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,061
[USOPP sighs]

131
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,563
Good, now let's go.

132
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,530
[NAMI]
Huh?

133
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:48,000
[MOHJI] Not so fast!
You have to get past me!

134
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,836
My name is Mohji.

135
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,404
I am a proud Buggy Pirate

136
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,807
and I won't let you get anywhere
near this stupid ship.

137
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,544
Get ready to fire!

138
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,879
Marines.

139
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:00,413
Bad!

140
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,981
[UNIT CHIEF]
Aim!

141
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,685
[UNIT CHIEF]
Fire.

142
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,023
Go contact the cannon unit.

143
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,426
We have to capture
this pirate vessel.

144
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:13,893
[MARINE D]
Sir.

145
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,428
Nami!

146
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,696
[NAMI]
I know.

147
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,006
[SMOKER]
Damn this storm.

148
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,742
[ZORO]
Which way is the sea?

149
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,843
I don't know.

150
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,045
The rain makes it hard to
tell where we're going.

151
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,213
[MARINE A]
There they are!

152
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,415
[MARINES yelling]

153
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,885
Damn, they're like roaches.
You wanna stop and fight 'em?

154
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,920
There's no time for that.

155
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,558
Oh wow. Who is that?!

156
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:53,232
I didn't know you were Zoro,
and a pirate as well.

157
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,768
Found one. Right here.

158
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,073
You lied.
You're just another liar!

159
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,076
Oh great! What the hell
did you do to that girl?!

160
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,580
You never asked me what
my name was, did you?

161
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,082
So I never lied, did I?

162
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,752
You know there's no way I'm
going to allow someone like you

163
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,887
to leave town with such
a legendary sword.

164
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,891
Give it to me, the Wado
Ichimonji! Right now!

165
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,928
Come and get it.

166
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,080
[ZORO]
Okay.

167
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,086
[SANJI] What a jerk!
You can't fight a girl!

168
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,189
[TASHIGI]
I can handle myself!

169
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,124
This is a fight
between the two of us.

170
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,527
I don't need any help
so back off!

171
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,963
[ZORO]
You heard her. Get outta here.

172
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,765
Let's go.

173
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,602
[SANJI]
Hey, Zoro!

174
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,538
If you hurt her,
I'm going to kick your ass!

175
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,673
Tashigi's got one!

176
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,179
I hate to disappoint,

177
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,683
but you will never get
this sword from me.

178
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,685
[MARINE F]
I can't believe she lost.

179
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,988
[MARINE G] I've never
seen her lose before.

180
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,858
Now I think it's
time for me to go.

181
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,231
[TASHIGI]
Why didn't you kill me?!

182
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,734
I know. It's 'cause I'm a girl.

183
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,203
You're lucky, Zoro...

184
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,873
...being born as a man.

185
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,708
[TASHIGI] It's pathetic
that you can't fight me

186
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,043
because I'm a woman.

187
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,211
It's embarrassing.

188
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:22,214
You may be physically stronger,
but you don't have the guts.

189
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,617
This sword isn't just
for decoration!

190
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,721
I don't even think you know what
it means to carry a sword.

191
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,522
[growls]

192
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,124
Would you shut up
for one second?

193
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,695
Look, you got the same
face as some girl I knew

194
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,896
who died a long time ago!

195
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,197
And before I know
a thing about you,

196
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,398
you're talking just like her.

197
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,934
What I want you to do is to stop
acting like some dead person

198
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,904
you don't even know
and try to be yourself!

199
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,739
Excuse the hell out of me!

200
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,041
It's not my fault I sound
like your dead girlfriend!

201
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,611
I had no idea it was so rude and
thoughtless of me to be myself!

202
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,715
You jerk! You ever
think before you talk?!

203
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,617
What'd you say?

204
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,254
I see the ship!
The harbor is up ahead!

205
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,729
Great, now what?

206
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:18,104
[SMOKER] Straw Hat Luffy,
you're finally here.

207
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,172
I already told you that
you couldn't make it

208
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,643
to the Grand Line without
beating me first, didn't I?

209
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,646
Oh yeah, I forgot.

210
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,649
You're really stupid.

211
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,785
Lets go.

212
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:36,155
Sanji, I'll be
right there. Go on.

213
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:41,127
I don't know about that.
This will be the end for you.

214
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,201
Go!

215
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,454
[UNIT CHIEF]
Fire!

216
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,228
Cannons, fire!

217
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,911
If we stay here even
a minute longer,

218
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,580
the Going Merry
will be done for.

219
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,886
You can't set sail yet!

220
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,822
Luffy and the
others aren't back.

221
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:47,226
There's no other choice.
If we stay here, she'll be sunk.

222
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,395
Right rudder full!

223
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,200
What about the rest of them?

224
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,734
We'll pick them up later.

225
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,270
[UNIT CHIEF] Don't let them
escape! After them!

226
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,272
[SANJI]
Nami!

227
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,440
Sanji!

228
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,441
[USOPP]
Sanji!

229
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,910
[SANJI]
Wait up! I'm back!

230
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,679
Where're the others?

231
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,949
Ugh. Who cares?
We'll just get 'em later.

232
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:12,785
Behind you!

233
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,453
Look out!

234
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,961
[SANJI]
Dammit. This is endless.

235
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,863
We have to get closer.

236
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,232
But there's no way that
we can take the ship back

237
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,299
against this current.

238
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,301
Ah, damnit.

239
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:29,935
[NAMI]
Usopp!

240
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,604
[USOPP]
Bastards!

241
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,317
Sanji! Usopp!

242
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,480
I am gonna enter the Grand Line.

243
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,851
Then I'll become
King of the Pirates.

244
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,254
I'm bored. Enough talk.

245
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,933
[LUFFY]
What's happening?

246
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,668
[SMOKER]
I ate the Plume Plume Fruit

247
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,705
so my body can be smoke
whenever I want.

248
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,617
[LUFFY screaming]

249
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,459
[SMOKER] What's wrong?
Had enough already?

250
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:14,907
Gum‐Gum Gatling!

251
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,353
[LUFFY]
Aw, crap! That's really gross!

252
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,426
My turn now. Smoke Screen!

253
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:40,532
Okay. Gum‐Gum Pistol!

254
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,037
[SMOKER]
Don't you see?

255
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,508
You've gotta go through me
to get to the Grand Line.

256
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,443
[SMOKER] I told you!

257
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:00,052
[SMOKER] You're not worth
30 million berries.

258
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,790
Your luck's run out.

259
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,095
[MAN] I wouldn't be
so sure about that

260
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,964
It's you!

261
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:27,613
[LUFFY] Hey, what's
goin' on? Who's that?

262
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:32,418
How nice. Now the government
can have your head.

263
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:37,056
The world is still
waiting for our answer.

264
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,915
[NAMI screaming]

265
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,840
Can someone tell me
what happened?

266
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,144
[NAMI]
Help!

267
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,646
Luffy!

268
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,881
Nami!

269
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,851
We gotta go!
The ship will be gone soon.

270
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,953
[LUFFY, USOPP, SANJI, ZORO]
Right!

271
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:41,987
[laughing]

272
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,024
Okay. Now, Gum‐Gum!

273
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:46,692
What?!

274
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,726
No. He can't.

275
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,628
I'm not gonna like this.

276
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,464
[LUFFY]
Heh. Rocket!

277
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,977
You're here.

278
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,365
[SMOKER] I'm sure he brought
the wind with him.

279
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:31,904
I knew it was him from the day
Gold Roger was executed.

280
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,606
He appeared like a brilliant
flash of lightning,

281
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:35,874
then he disappeared.

282
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:36,842
It's him.

283
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,777
[LUFFY]
Now!

284
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:44,116
Listen! I'm the man who'll
be King of the Pirates!

285
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,890
[laughing]

286
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,792
Go!

287
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,961
If that's what you want,
then by all means,

288
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,130
make your dream happen.

289
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,732
[SMOKER]
Why did you help that man?

290
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,869
[SMOKER]
Dragon!

291
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,474
It is not our place to
come between that man

292
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,977
and his chosen path, Smoker.

293
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,057
Set sail. We're going after him.

294
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,092
What?!

295
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,428
We'll enter the Grand Line.

296
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,495
But, Captain,

297
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,165
you‐you can't abandon
your post on this island.

298
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,101
What would command say?

299
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:40,005
Tell them... I don't
care about orders.

300
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,106
I'm coming with you.

301
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,508
[OFFICER]
Sergeant Major Tashigi!

302
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,478
I have to hunt down
Roronoa Zoro.

303
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:49,848
He's mine. I will get revenge.

304
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,461
That was certainly a flashy
gust of wind for all of us.

305
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:06,198
I have never been one to turn
down luck that's in my favor.

306
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,600
Where are we headed now?

307
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,535
[BUGGY]
The Grand Line.

308
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,870
The Grand Line?

309
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,540
I'm going to settle this.
That boy will face me.

310
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,043
There is nowhere he can run.

311
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,879
We won't stop till
the Grand Line.

312
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,050
[LUFFY]
Feels like she wants to capsize!

313
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,055
Hey, look! A light!

314
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,790
Is that a lighthouse?

315
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,225
[NAMI]
It's one of the guide posts.

316
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,061
The entrance to the Grand Line
is somewhere ahead.

317
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,897
The Grand Line is
somewhere just out ahead.

318
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,032
What now?

319
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,066
Do we have to go there

320
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,136
in the middle of a freakin'
hurricane like this?

321
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,678
[chuckles]

322
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,049
[SANJI]
Okay then.

323
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,985
I think we should say something
to mark the occasion.

324
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:00,819
[USOPP]
Right.

325
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:01,887

Let's do it.

I'm goin' to the Grand Line
to find the All Blue!

I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

330
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,270
I'm going so I can draw a
map of the entire world.

331
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:24,676
I guess I'm going... to be
a brave warrior of the sea!

332
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,893
And now, to the Grand Line!

333
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,631

00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,832
<i>Get 'em to come back to me,</i>

349
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,267
<i>I'll do what I must,</i>

350
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,804
<i>Because they're</i>
<i>everything I wanna be.</i>

351
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,806
<i>Wrap these arms around my dreams</i>

352
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,708
<i>And pull 'em back</i>
<i>from yesterday,</i>

353
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,710
<i>If I'm holding hands with you,</i>

354
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,114
<i>I'm sure that we</i>
<i>can make the way.♪</i>

355
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:20,192
[USOPP] What's going on
with that flock of birds?

356
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,726
[SANJI]
They're eating fish.

357
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,128
[NAMI]
Catch some, okay?

358
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,196
[LUFFY]
Leave it to me.

359
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,230
[ZORO]
Hm? It's not a fish.

360
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,131
[NAMI]
It's a girl.

361
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,700
[USOPP]
Oh crap, it's the Marine Fleet!

362
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,001
[LUFFY]
Are they after me?

363
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,070
[USOPP]
Uh! They're firing at us!

364
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,905
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

365
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:38,677
"Precursor to a New Adventure.
Apis, A Mysterious Girl."

366
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,213
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
