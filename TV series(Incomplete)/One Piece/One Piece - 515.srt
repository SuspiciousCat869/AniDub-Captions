[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,661
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,229
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,265
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,800
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,603
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,271
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,207
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,077
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,713
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,247
of the World Government,

12
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,617
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,290
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,493
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:18,164
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,438
[NARRATOR]
After losing his brother, Ace,

18
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,740
Luffy fell into despair.

19
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,812
Me? King of the Pirates?

20
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,281
Dammit!

21
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,251
I'm too weak!

22
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,820
[NARRATOR] However,
after speaking with Luffy,

23
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:42,922
Rayleigh convinced him
to return to Marineford

24
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,559
and deliver
a message to his crew.

25
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,329
[NARRATOR]
When the rest of the Straw Hats

26
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,098
learned of his puzzling behavior

27
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:53,134
through an article
in the newspaper...

28
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:57,304
[NARRATOR] ...they each found
a new purpose in their journey.

29
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,409
Because Luffy wants to become
the King of the Pirates.

30
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,611
And to help him,

31
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,947
I need to be the best navigator
the world has ever seen!

32
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,417
[FRANKY]
Listen up, Luffy.

33
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:14,588
The Thousand Sunny
isn't givin' up, not ever.

34
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:18,525
And as her captain, I know
you aren't givin' up either.

35
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,227
So, let's sail.

36
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:24,164
[SANJI]
Luffy, when we meet again...

37
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,637
[SANJI]
...I'll be the best damned chef

38
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,371
in all of the New World.

39
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:34,541
I'll make food fit for
the King of the Pirates!

This is a spectacle you'll
have to see to believe!

No eyeballs either!

53
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,485
Step right up and meet
the walking, talking skeleton!

54
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:22,289
The strangest thing is,
it's only got one set of elbows!

55
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,225
Who knew such an anomaly
could exist in this world?

56

Hey! Do you think we're
a buncha suckers? Gimme a break!

57
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,665
Huh? Did we offend you?

It's not walking or talking!

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,835

Luffy's made up his mind.

There's no more time
to waste, for me or anyone.

65

Hey, bonehead!
What's the big idea?

66
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:52,219
I'd better do
something and quickly!

This is a rip-off!

74
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,844
[BROOK] When he saw me
for the first time,

75
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,348
he wasn't afraid of my
appearance in the slightest.

76

He reached out to me
without hesitation.

For 50 years,

I'd been drifting aimlessly
on those dark, lonely waters.

84

I don't want to hear you
make excuses like that!

than 45 degrees.

00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:21,048
Why did you come to save
me in the first place?

176
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:24,851
For the last time,
I don't want you here!

177
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:30,724
[panting]

178
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,659
[ROBIN]
Do you hear me?

179
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,462
I just want to die!

180
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,699
[LUFFY] If that's Robin's
enemy, then I know what to do.

181
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,336
[LUFFY]
Shoot down that flag.

182
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,680
[gasps] No way.

183
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,248
You're all going to die!

184
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:58,085
You morons can't challenge the
entire world and expect to win!

185
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:03,090
Yeah? Bring it on!

186
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,659
[ROBIN crying]

187
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,694
Robin!

188
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:11,331
There's still something
I want to hear you say!

189
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:18,438
Tell me you want to live!

190
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:27,448
[ROBIN]
If I'm allowed to say my wish,

191
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,249
just this once...

192
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,219
[ROBIN]
...then I...

193
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,725
I want to live!

194
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:42,028
Take me with you!
Take me away from here!

195
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,171
Please, Robin, come back inside.

196
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:53,340
You're going to
catch cold out here.

197
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,709
[ROBIN]
I'll stay here, thank you.

198
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:59,246
After all, I'm a pirate
and you're Revolutionaries.

199
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,149
It's not wise to trust you yet.

200
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,085
I can't go into a cabin
without any exits.

201
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:08,922
Robin! There's no reason any of
us would ever want to hurt you!

202
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,392
It's all right. This is
the way I did things

203
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,961
back when I was alone.
Just let me stay.

204
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,329
Well, okay, if that's
what you want.

205
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:17,264
All right!

206
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,232
Go get as many blankets
as you can find!

207
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,901
And get her some food
and something hot to drink,

208
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:21,935
make it snappy!

209
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,271
But, we already
set things up inside!

210
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,107
Hurry up! And bring a sofa
out here while you're at it!

211
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,174
Sir!

212
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:33,213
[ROBIN] Luffy, do you
think I can get stronger

213
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,916
seeing the world through
your father's eyes?

214
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:39,519
By walking in his footsteps,
till we meet again?

215
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,390
[ROBIN] This is the
first time I've wanted

216
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,193
to grow stronger
for someone else.

217
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,428
It's not such a bad feeling.

218
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,416
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, on the
Bowin Islands on the Grand Line.

219
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,454
[USOPP panting]

220
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:16,323
[HERACLES]
What's gotten into you, Usopp'n?

221
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,992
[USOPP] Gotta turn
all this fat into muscle!

222
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,428
[HERACLES]
Oh, that's a good idea!

223
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,163
[USOPP]
Gotta get strong!

224
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,831
[HERACLES]
Because that's the only way

225
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,800
to get off this island'n?

226
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:29,002
[USOPP]
Gotta get really strong!

227
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,938
[HERACLES]
Yes, you mentioned that!

228
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,440
[USOPP]
Gotta get really, really strong!

229
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,743
[HERACLES]
Er, how strong, exactly?

230
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:36,977
[USOPP]
Really, really, really, really,

231
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,546
really, really, really strong!

232
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,181
[HERACLES] You're quite
serious, aren't you?

233
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,616
[USOPP panting]

234
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,951
[HERACLES]
But why the sudden change?

235
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:48,355
[HERACLES] What did you
see in that newspaper'n?

236
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:54,395
[USOPP panting]

237
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:57,865
[USOPP]
Our captain sent us a message.

238
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,033
[HERACLES]
Message'n?

239
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,802
[ZORO]
What are you talkin' about?

240
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:03,370
Get on already!

241
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,404
[USOPP]
Huh?

242
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:08,341
Come on, we're
friends now, right?

243
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,945
[panting]

244
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:22,756
Luffy!

245
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,560
Usopp.

246
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:30,497
I didn't know you
were here, too.

247
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,899
Finish him!

248
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,702
Then we can all leave
this place together!

249
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:38,838
I'll win no matter what!

250
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:41,408
[USOPP]
You know,

251
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,143
I never doubted him.

252
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,411
I just thought,

253
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:47,547
he could become King of the
Pirates with or without me.

254
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:49,683
Of course he could!

255
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:53,587
We're finally here! We made it!

256
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,289
If we keep this up
and sail around

257
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,458
the rest of the world, we'll
come to this wall one more time.

258
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:03,030
And when we do... then I'm
gonna be King of the Pirates!

259
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:06,166
[USOPP] But I was wrong--
not because he's weak,

260
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,803
but because others are strong.

261
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:11,038
Even Luffy's not invincible.

262
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:14,741
And he can't do
everything on his own!

263
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:17,478
So I have to get stronger,

264
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:19,913
to protect him and
the rest of the crew!

265
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:23,884
[panting]

266
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:27,888
Dammit, Heracles!
I need your help, okay?

267
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:31,825
Whatever it takes
to improve myself, I'll do it!

268
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:36,430
[USOPP]
Please, Master Heracles.

269
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,132
[HERACLES]
Huh? M-Master'n?

270
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,434
That's right.

271
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:44,372
You have weapons, so teach me!
You're obviously a good fighter

272
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:47,074
if you can survive
on an island like this.

273
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,341
Tell me your secrets!

274
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,145
[HERACLES] You-- You really
think I'm a good fighter'n?

275
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,081
Sure! I mean, you're amazing!

276
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:58,652
[HERACLES] It is I!
Your Master'n! Heracles'n!

277
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:01,355
I know that, but awesome!

278
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:04,759
[HERACLES]
Er, please have a seat, Usopp'n.

279
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:06,994
[USOPP]
Yes, Master!

280
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,696
[HERACLES]
Pay close attention, pupil'n!

281
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,166
This forest is full of plants
called Pop Greens'n.

282
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,336
They're known for turning
hostile as soon as they sprout,

283
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,839
which you've no doubt noticed.

284
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,641
Now these are their seeds'n.

285
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:24,177
What do you use them for?

286
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,679
[HERACLES]
Many things.

287
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:28,783
They each have
unique applications.

288
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:30,317
Whoa.

289
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:32,118
[USOPP]
Hang in there, Luffy!

290
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,456
[HERACLES]
Run, Usopp'n!

291
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,860
This forest is your
training ground'n!

292
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,596
[USOPP] If it'll help you
be King of the Pirates,

293
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:45,999
I'll become the
Sniper King for real!

294
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:50,437
[USOPP yells]

295
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,177
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, on Gloom
Island on the Grand Line--

296
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,912
the ruins of Muggy Kingdom.

297
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,314
[ZORO]
Please!

298
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,892
Will you train
me as a swordsman?

299
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,194
You disappoint me. Stand up.

300
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:19,800
I can't believe you would ask
your enemy for instruction.

301
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,835
Have you no shame?

302
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,206
[MIHAWK] Get out of here.
This is pathetic.

303
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:30,110
A pity, perhaps, but
I overestimated your worth.

304
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,413
[ZORO grunts]

305
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:33,613
[MIHAWK]
I said stand up.

306
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,549
You're making
a fool of yourself.

307
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,619
Please help me!

308
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:41,288
First of all,
the baboons beat you,

309
00:18:41,322 --> 00:18:44,224
and after that, you couldn't
even make it out to sea.

310
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,027
I can't help you. It's hopeless.

311
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:52,432
[ZORO]
They didn't beat me.

312
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,533
[MIHAWK gasps]

313
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,235
[MIHAWK]
What?

314
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:57,804
[ZORO] You're the only
one left to take down.

315
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,708
But I'm just not good enough

316
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:02,877
to win against you
the way I am now.

317
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,212
Anybody can see that!

318
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,048
I don't follow.

319
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:09,883
Clearly you still
consider me your enemy,

320
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:13,788
yet here you are bowing down,
begging for my help.

321
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:15,689
What do you mean to do?

322
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:19,626
Kill you, of course.

323
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:23,397
[grunts]

324
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,900
[laughs]

325
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,003
You admit you want to kill me,

326
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:32,039
and you expect me
to assist you in that?

327
00:19:32,072 --> 00:19:35,375
You're strange.
What a ridiculous request!

328
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:38,712
Aren't you the least bit
embarrassed? [chuckles]

329
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:43,284
Perhaps your priorities
are different now, Roronoa?

330
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:44,918
[gasps]

331
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:48,956
You, the ghost woman.
Go take care of his injuries.

332
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:50,624
[gasps] What?

333
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,394
Why on earth would
I take orders from you?

334
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:55,162
[MIHAWK]
We'll begin after you recover.

335
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,263
[gasps]

336
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:58,298
[PERONA groans]
Mr. Fancy Pants,

337
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,200
treatin' me like
some kind of maid!

338
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,635
Well, what're you waiting for?

339
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:02,736
Let's go, stupid!

340
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,272
[door opens]

341
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:08,175
[MIHAWK] He's a fool,
but a man like that would not

342
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:11,044
throw away his pride
for his own sake.

343
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:13,613
He must be thinking
of someone else.

344
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:18,752
"3D" is crossed out,
and "2Y" is under it?

345
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:19,887
You're right, I see!

346
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,722
It's like a tattoo on his arm!

347
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:23,724
A while back, the whole crew

348
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:27,795
promised we would meet up in
a certain place in three days.

349
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:29,730
But we just couldn't.

350
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:33,600
So, let me guess--
"3D" means three days, right?

351
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:36,870
Then the "2Y" is probably, um...

352
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:38,906
[ZORO]
Two years!

353
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:40,207
I knew that!

354
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,111
So, the meeting is going to
be two years later. All right.

355
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:45,979
Means he pulled that
stunt in Marineford

356
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,515
knowing it would get
him in the newspaper.

357
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:52,186
That way he could make sure
each of us got the message.

358
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:55,722
That was smart,
especially for Luffy.

359
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,391
But none of us
have what it takes

360
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,827
to survive in the New World.

361
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,563
That's why we have to train.

362
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,899
So, we'll all be stronger
the next time we meet!

363
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,276
[PERONA] Hey, didn't I
tell you to rest up?

364
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,420
[ZORO grunts]

365
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,190
No way!

366
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,928
[LUFFY]
Heh. See ya!

367
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,497
You saved me.

368
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,865
Who the hell are you anyway?

369
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:41,468
My name's Monkey D. Luffy.

370
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:45,005
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

371
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,076
[ZORO] Until the day comes when
I defeat him and take his title,

372
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:52,712
I swear that I will never lose!

373
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:57,384
Is that okay,
King of the Pirates?

374
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,788
[chuckles] Uh-huh!

375
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:05,993
As long as I can still
stand, I can train.

376
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:07,928
Let's get started.

377
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:14,534
Heh. There's one baboon
you haven't beat yet.

378
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:18,405
They've mastered swordsmanship
by observing humans.

379
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:23,009
They even organized by rank,
all the way up to their master.

380
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:26,413
He's the leader of every
baboon on this island.

381
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:29,717
[MASTER HUMANDRILL growls]

382
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,018
[ZORO]
That sword...

383
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:34,154
He learned to fight
by copying what I do.

384
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,624
He's not like the others.
You should be cautious.

385
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:40,194
[ZORO]
Sounds like fun.

386
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:42,630
[ZORO] You're nothing but
a stepping stone, baboon!

387
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:44,598
[MASTER HUMANDRILL yelling]

388
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:46,266
[ZORO yells]

389
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:06,286
[STRAW HAT PIRATES]
See you at Sabaody in two years!

390
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,163
[NARRATOR] Plotting
a course for his future,

391
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:18,198
Luffy leaves Amazon Lily behind

392
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:21,635
and travels with Rayleigh to
the deserted island of Ruskaina.

393
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:24,871
There he struggles to unlock
an arsenal of new abilities

394
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,408
as he goes head-to-head
against the giant creatures

395
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:29,042
that inhabit the island.

396
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,844
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

397
00:23:30,878 --> 00:23:35,215
"Luffy's Training Begins! To the
Place We Promised in 2 Years!"

398
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,018
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
