1
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,127
[thinking]
There's no mistaking it.

2
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,595
This is my handwriting.

3
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:12,832
Sky Islands, Marine
Base G8, and this gold.

4
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,501
If what's written here is true,

5
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,637
could everything they
said be true, as well?

6
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,040
If I can just get back
to Cocoyashi Village,

7
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,742
I'm sure I could
figure it all out.

8
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,945
But without a decent ship,
how am I gonna get there?

9
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,548
And, I'm on the Grand
Line, of all places!

10
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,016
According to this map,

11
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:33,019
it's impossible to sail directly
from this sea to the East Blue.

12
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:42,729
[USOPP] Wait, what's that?!
You're the captain?!

13
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,132
Aw, man! That was a lucky break!

14
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,567
If I hadn't gotten
my memory back,

15
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,568
I would have been stuck

16
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,269
"aye-aye-ing"
Captain Usopp forever!

17
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,906
Shut your mouth!
I'm never gonna believe it!

18
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,174
No matter what anyone says,

19
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:55,508
I know that I'm the
great Captain Usopp!

20
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,846
I have an army of 8,000 pirates
who obey my every command!

21
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,247
Hahahaha!

22
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,750
That's the Usopp I know,
through and through!

23
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,151
But you're not the captain.

24
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,653
You're Usopp, the sniper
of the Straw Hat Pirates!

25
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:10,324
[USOPP thinking] Crap! The
tables have turned against me!

26
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,726
[CHOPPER thinking] This guy's
a monster, just like me.

27
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,027
And yet he's the captain?

28
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,128
Hey, Chopper!

29
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,797
Ahhh! Keep away!

30
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:19,867
Aw, come on!

31
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,969
How long are you
gonna act like that?

32
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,238
Let's play like we always do!

33
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,072
So, I'm the ship's doctor,

34
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,341
and this is
something I always do?

35
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,711
Yeah! You do it every
time we have a party!

36
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,445
It's like your "thing"!

37
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,382
Come on, Chopper!

38
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,084
That rubber monkey said
he got his memories back,

39
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:40,387
yet he's acting like just
as much of an idiot as before.

40
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,822
That's right.

41
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:44,591
The captain never ever changes,
no matter what happens to him.

42
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,193
[USOPP thinking]
Even if I am a pirate,

43
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,195
I'm nothing compared to
these freaks of nature!

44
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,430
I'd never survive sailing
with the likes of them!

45
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,933
How'd I get myself
into this mess?

46
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,601
[ROBIN]
Now it's clear what happened.

47
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,671
Everyone didn't miraculously
lose their memories overnight,

48
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:58,738
they were stolen.

49
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,008
And so the
obvious culprit is.

50
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,410
The only person we
all remember: That brat!

51
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,745
What would that
freaky kid want

52
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,547
with our memories anyway?

53
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:07,747
Beats me.

54
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,383
Wait a sec!

55
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,053
We have to get
Nami and Zoro back!

56
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,322
Come on! Let's go! Hah!

57
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,325
[ROBIN] You're right, but
we should wait until morning.

58
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,660
Hmm?
Why can't we go right now?

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,096
Searching for two people
on an unknown island

60
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,999
in the middle of the night
is a recipe for disaster.

61
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,168
Guess you've got a point.

62
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,670
Let's get some rest

63
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,905
and then we'll begin our
search when the sun comes up.

64
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,274
I don't think that boy
will be back tonight.

65
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,643
We gave him a lot of trouble.

66
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:38,378
He'll think twice before
showing up here again.

67
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,814
Hmm...
Right! It's settled!

68
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,216
We'll rest up

69
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,617
and start the search
first thing in the morning!

70
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,152
[SANJI]
Hold on a sec.

71
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,254
I'm all for bringing that
lovely lady Nami back,

72
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,922
but not that Zoro guy.

73
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,158
He can just stay
gone for all I care.

74
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,761
I agree! If you two
wanna go look for him,

75
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,295
you can do it on your own!

76
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,764
I, uh.... I'm not sure.

77
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,399
What the?!
What're you saying?!

78
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,702
We're saying,
"Why look for Zoro?"

79
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,571
He's a pirate
hunter, remember?!

80
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,138
Why should we go
through all the trouble

81
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,274
of chasing down
a guy like that?

82
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,811
Isn't it obvious?
Because he's our friend!

83
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:14,014
Just because you said
it doesn't mean it's true.

84
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,415
Come on!

85
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,217
That guy sure didn't act
like he was our friend.

86
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,452
Surely you noticed that.

87
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:25,559
The way he left is
proof enough for me.

88
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,228
Usopp is the sniper.
Sanji is the cook.

89
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,165
Chopper is the doctor.
Robin is the archaeologist.

90
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,301
Nami is the navigator.
And Zoro is the swordsman.

91
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,003
We are the Straw Hat Pirates

92
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,605
and we don't leave
any man behind.

93
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,376
[ROBIN] Then we'll have to get
Mr. Swordsman's memory back.

94
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:43,577
No problem!

95
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,712
All I have to do is kick
that brat's butt again!

96
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,649
That's how I got mine back!
Sound good, Chopper?

97
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,518
Well, it looks like tomorrow's
gonna be a really busy day.

98
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,788
All right, let's all get
some sleep while we can.

99
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,326
[ROBIN thinking] The key
to unraveling this mystery

100
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,161
is somewhere on that island.

101
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,568
[DRIM thinking] It seems
that I underestimated you,

102
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,771
Monkey D. Luffy.

103
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,173
You're a formidable enemy.

104
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:17,545
Still, you won't stop me
from making my wish come true.

105
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:21,615
But, in order to do so,
I'll need an ally.

106
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,520
An ally like a certain
skilled swordsman.

107
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,466
Hmph!

108
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,700
[sighs]

109
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,869
[thinking]
That's right!

110
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,970
He's different than
he was yesterday.

111
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,173
This man is Pirate Hunter Zoro.

112
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,610
If I try to approach him,
things could go bad quickly.

113
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,412
Okay then. I'll cut
my losses for tonight.

114
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,582
There'll be other
chances soon, anyway.

115
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,686
Oh, yes. And when
that time comes,

116
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:02,122
your work will truly begin.

117
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,964
[thinking] It is said that
fish from around the world

118
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,400
gather together in the All Blue.

119
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,303
I've dreamed of
reaching that sea...

120
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,440
Why'd you help me?

121
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,911
It doesn't make sense to
sacrifice so much for me!

122
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,546
You old fool!

123
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:26,347
Tell me!

124
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,114
Because for my entire life,

125
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:31,618
I've had the
same dream as you.

126
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,120
A restaurant?

127
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,155
I was thinking that if I make
it out of this mess alive,

128
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,425
I'd could build a restaurant
as my final purpose.

129
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,827
Great! And I'll
even help you do it.

130
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,830
So don't die okay?

131
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,765
Ha! A weak little
brat like you

132
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,067
couldn't be much
good for anything!

133
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:50,170
Then I'll become strong!

134
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,941
[thinking] That annoying
old geezer saved my life.

135
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,143
There's no way I would
have ever left him.

136
00:07:56,243 --> 00:08:00,347
So why? What the
hell happened to me?

137
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:07,154
[thinking]
Pepper, Carrot, Onion.

138
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:10,323
I wonder what happened
to the Usopp Pirates?

139
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,995
It's go time,
Brave Usopp Pirates!

140
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,698
We do have a village
that we need to protect!

141
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,901
[KAYA] So what adventure are you
going to tell me about today?

142
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,970
[USOPP]
Well let's see. Oh I know!

143
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,105
What about the story of me
fighting a giant goldfish,

144
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:28,308
at the south pole, when
I was only five years old!

145
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,210
Goldfish?

146
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,778
[USOPP]
A giant goldfish!

147
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,814
What first astounded me was
the immense size of its poop!

148
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,682
It was so big that
when I landed on it

149
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,050
I thought it was solid ground.

150
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:39,486
Usopp! Hahahha!

151
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,023
[thinking] I've always
dreamed of being a pirate,

152
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:43,824
just like my old man.

153
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,459
Did I actually
become a real one,

154
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:48,562
leaving everyone
behind to do so?

155
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,334
[CHOPPER thinking]
Why am I here?

156
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,402
Why am I here
with these humans?

157
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:59,273
The only ones I've ever trusted
were Dr. Hiriluk and Doctorine.

158
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,442
Even among my fellow reindeer,

159
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,612
I had no friends.
I was always alone.

160
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:09,183
[HIRILUK] I promise you I'm
not going to shoot you, see?!

161
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:14,120
Listen, my name is
Hiriluk. Doctor Hiriluk!

162
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,891
And if that's true there's
no disease that can't be cured.

163
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,160
Let them all laugh
at me, I don't care.

164
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,031
My medical skills will save
this country yet! You'll see!

165
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,465
I raise this skull
and crossbones

166
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,402
to challenge all
diseases of the world.

167
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:29,436
A skull?

168
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,371
This symbol represents
my conviction

169
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,308
and belief that there is
nothing that's impossible!

170
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:39,079
I will save this country
with my doctor's skills!

171
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,516
[thinking] And now I have
friends? Six of them?

172
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:44,484
How am I supposed to
believe I'm out here

173
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,489
with them as a doctor
on a pirate ship?

174
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,725
But what if it's true?

175
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,963
None of that's
gonna happen.

176
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,065
Nothin' can take
away my dreams.

177
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:01,234
And I know it's the
same for you guys too.

178
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,704
Nami, Zoro.
Sit tight and don't worry.

179
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,605
We're coming for you.

180
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,342
Hey! Wake up!

181
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:43,110
[ROBIN]
We're already up and ready.

182
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,779
Mr. Cook and
Mr. Doctor are here, too.

183
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:48,115
[LUFFY]
Huh?

184
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,251
There's no way I'd ever
leave a lady like that behind.

185
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:52,953
And besides, Robin's going
to need herself a bodyguard.

186
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,521
And if anyone gets injured,

187
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,756
then they'll surely need the
assistance of a doctor, right?

188
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:59,660
Which means that I should
stay behind and guard the ship.

189
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,961
You're coming too, Usopp.

190
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,963
Well, actually I've got this

191
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:06,099
"My Heart'll Stop If I
Go On the Island" disease.

192
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,902
Just come with us!
I know one thing:

193
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,604
Usopp, the brave
warrior of the sea,

194
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,874
is a man who always comes
through when things get rough!

195
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,308
That's me!

196
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,978
All right then! We're all going!

197
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,614
Aw, crap! I got caught
up in the moment!

198
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:23,517
So how are we gonna get
across the bay to the island?

199
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:26,019
I think a raft is
the most viable option.

200
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,855
Good idea! Hey!
Make us a raft, Usopp!

201
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,791
Why should I?!

202
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,927
I'm Captain Usopp, remember?!

203
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:34,161
Yeah, yeah.

204
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,329
At the very least,
I'm a sniper!

205
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,367
Either way, I can't properly
do the job of a shipwright!

206
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:44,471
To make a raft, all you do
is tie some logs together!

207
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:45,739
Problem solved!

208
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,241
Are you sure those are the
right kind of knots to use?

209
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:50,744
Well, yeah! A knot's
a knot, right?

210
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,345
[thinking]
You've gotta be kidding!

211
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,315
That thing's gonna break apart
as soon as it hits the water!

212
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,951
But mine looks
a whole lot cooler.

213
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,054
Check this baby out!

214
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,690
No way!
Mine is the coolest!

215
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,193
Sorry, but there's no
comparison. Mine rules.

216
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,061
[USOPP]
Oh, come on! Seriously?!

217
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,397
How can you call
yourselves pirates

218
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:12,365
when you can't even
make a decent raft?!

219
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:14,101
[SANJI]
Ooo!

220
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,069
Such amazing workmanship!

221
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,872
See? Usopp's a man who
always comes through!

222
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,407
Hm?

223
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:22,809
[thinking] Wait, how did
I know how to build this thing?

224
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,910
I don't get it.

225
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,281
All right! Let's Go!

226
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,621
Thanks for the room.

227
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:36,356
What do I owe you?

228
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:37,791
[OLD INN MAN]
Sorry, who are you?

229
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,194
Huh? What? I'm a
guest of the inn.

230
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:41,562
I stayed here last night!

231
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:43,096
[OLD INN MAN]
Do you recognize her?

232
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,365
[INN WOMAN] No,
I've never seen her before.

233
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,767
[YOUNG INN MAN]
Wait, she might be a thief!

234
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,036
What? A thief?!

235
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:52,072
Hey, now hold on a
second! I'm a customer!

236
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,741
I just met all
three of you yesterday!

237
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,843
Do you seriously
not remember me?

238
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,513
I mean, surely
you do, Mr. Manager.

239
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,515
Manager? You mean me?

240
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,384
Uh... He is the manager
of this inn, right?

241
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,253
[YOUNG INN MAN and INN WOMAN]
I don't know.

242
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,494
[thinking] It's nice that I
got to stay for free and all,

243
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:16,864
but what in the
world is going on here?

244
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,365
Could this mean that--

245
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,268
Who're you?

246
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,137
Don't tell me you
lost your memories, too?

247
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:30,678
It's just like what
happened to me yesterday!

248
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:31,778
[VILLAGE MAN A]
Yesterday?

249
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:32,913
[USOPP]
Yeah, that's right.

250
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,514
They might have
come through here.

251
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,116
There was a swordsman
with green hair

252
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:37,985
and a woman
driving a weird boat.

253
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,519
So did you see them?

254
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,722
[VILLAGE MAN A] Yesterday...
Now what did I do yesterday?

255
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,190
Not you, too?!

256
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,259
What is wrong with the
people on this crazy island?!

257
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,094
Not a single one of these
nitwits remembers anything

258
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,528
about what they did yesterday!

259
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:51,665
Hahahahaha!
What carefree people!

260
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:54,100
I think it's a little more
than being "carefree."

261
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,237
And we're not
really ones to talk.

262
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:57,504
We're just like them.

263
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,407
It might be more
than just coincidence.

264
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:03,043
So what's the plan?
What do we do?

265
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,979
It'll be kinda tough finding
them in this situation.

266
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,948
Right! Back to
the ship then!

267
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,549
No good thing is
gonna come from us

268
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,451
wandering around
on this creepy island.

269
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,386
So, what do you say?

270
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,356
Hey, Nami!

271
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,691
Oh, crap!

272
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,028
Hey! Wait!

273
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:30,670
What a day.

274
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:34,975
Why'd you run
away from us, Nami?

275
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,277
You'll never get this
away from me, got it?

276
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,613
You'd have to kill me
before I'd let it go.

277
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:41,014
Don't say that!

278
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,116
There's no way I'd hurt
a beautiful lady like you!

279
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,518
That's ridiculous!

280
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:47,054
I promise, I won't
lay a finger on you!

281
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:49,256
Though I'd really like to!

282
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,792
Hey doc, what kind of
disease does he have?

283
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,093
Can't you do anything for him?

284
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:54,895
It's definitely a
serious condition,

285
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,697
but I'm pretty sure
there's no cure.

286
00:14:56,797 --> 00:14:58,465
Fine, let's make a deal.

287
00:14:58,566 --> 00:14:59,566
What kind of deal?

288
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,702
I promise to give you
10% of my treasure,

289
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:05,439
if you promise to take me
back to Cocoyashi Village.

290
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:06,406
No way.

291
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:07,875
Okay, then 20%.

292
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:08,909
Nuh-uh.

293
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,444
Fine! 30%!

294
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:11,178
Can't do it.

295
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,214
It'll kill me, but 50%!

296
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:14,414
Sorry.

297
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,183
Nnnn... Gah!!

298
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,384
Just how much
of this treasure

299
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,219
are you trying to
swindle me out of?!

300
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,256
Come on, Nami!
You love that treasure! Hah!

301
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,991
There's no way that you'd
ever give it up to anybody.

302
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,260
Hey, how the
heck did you know

303
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,628
that I was gonna
double-cross you?

304
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:30,297
Ha ha ha!

305
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:33,467
Because we're friends,
Nami! How else?

306
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:34,701
Gimme a break!

307
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,070
Why would I ever be
friends with the likes of you?

308
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,405
This is ridiculous.

309
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:41,374
The negotiations are over.
I'm leaving. See ya!

310
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,578
Step aside, please.

311
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:45,879
Not happening.

312
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,748
Nami, you are going
to come along with us.

313
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:50,183
You're out of
your freakin' mind.

314
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,519
Why would I go
anywhere with you guys?

315
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,854
Now move it, jerk!

316
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,455
I won't.

317
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:57,858
[ROBIN]
Miss Navigator.

318
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,226
Huh?

319
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:00,594
You've been feeling that
there's something odd

320
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:04,031
about this island ever
since you set foot on it.

321
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,665
Am I wrong?

322
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:13,174
You look perplexed.
What's the matter?

323
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:15,442
There was a boy
holding a strange horn.

324
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,179
Yeah, last night I got
a good punch in on him.

325
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,113
And then some smoke
came out of his horn

326
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,415
and then it
went into my body

327
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:23,083
and then I could
remember stuff!

328
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,384
That's right.

329
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,187
The captain has all
of his memories back.

330
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:29,423
Preposterous, are you
sure you weren't dreaming?

331
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:30,657
No, it's true!

332
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:33,727
I saw the whole thing
happen with my own two eyes!

333
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,128
I also seem to
remember seeing

334
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,464
that little brat the
night before last, as well.

335
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,733
What I wanna know
is why he came back.

336
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,867
It's just a theory,

337
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,002
but maybe he
wasn't able to steal

338
00:16:42,103 --> 00:16:43,971
all of your
memories in one shot.

339
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:45,306
Even with just what I know,

340
00:16:45,406 --> 00:16:46,774
you all seem to have
experienced numerous

341
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:49,510
incredible adventures
during your journeys together.

342
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,278
It was too much
to take all at once,

343
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,181
so he starved himself
and returned yesterday?

344
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,983
The theory seems
logical enough.

345
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,286
Hey, Robin! Do you think
that memories taste good?

346
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,689
So then that little boy.

347
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,557
Bye! See ya!

348
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:06,060
[LUFFY]
All right then!

349
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,994
Let's go kick that
little runt's butt again

350
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,064
and get everybody's
memories back!

351
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:12,299
Then Zoro will
rejoin our crew!

352
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,435
I doubt that it's gonna
be as simple as that,

353
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:18,105
but we definitely need to give
that brat some painful payback.

354
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,708
Look, can't we just
forget about Zoro?

355
00:17:20,808 --> 00:17:22,476
Even if we get
our memories back.

356
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,478
It's kind of unsettling
to be in a pirate crew

357
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:27,047
on a pirate ship with a
pirate hunter, you know?

358
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,450
Zoro's the swordsman
and Nami's the navigator.

359
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,418
They're our friends
and part of our crew.

360
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,821
It still bothers me when
you say that, you know!

361
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:37,090
How can I be a pirate, much
less friends with pirates?

362
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,626
Look, I'm the one who's
gonna be bothered without you.

363
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,496
Without a navigator,
the ship can't go anywhere!

364
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:44,198
Understand?!

365
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:45,900
[LUFFY] Robin! Do you
have any idea where

366
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,501
that little runt is hiding?

367
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,904
[ROBIN] Well, there is one place
that I'd like to check out.

368
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:52,773
[LUFFY]
Okay then! Let's go!

369
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,041
Hey, wait! My gold!

370
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,476
Don't worry!
I'll carry the lady's stuff!

371
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,879
If doing so means
I get to be with you,

372
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:00,981
then this is no trouble at all!

373
00:18:01,082 --> 00:18:04,050
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

374
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,154
[thinking] Even with
everything that's happening,

375
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,023
they all follow Luffy.

376
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:13,060
I wonder if it's true
that I have friends now.

377
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,529
[LUFFY] Hey, Chopper!
What are you waiting for?

378
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:17,264
Let's go!

379
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:18,765
Aye-aye!

380
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:49,563
If you wanna eat, help yourself.

381
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,932
Well, it's true that
I am rather hungry.

382
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:54,835
But this isn't the
kind of food that I eat.

383
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:56,270
Oh, yeah?

384
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,372
Tell me, why haven't you
asked me who I am yet?

385
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:00,774
Ah! That's right.

386
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,711
The people that live on this
island don't remember anything.

387
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:05,646
Not even their
own names, huh?

388
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:08,682
No point in asking.

389
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:12,519
You're on a quest to become the
strongest in the world, right?

390
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,289
Hmm, if that's the case,

391
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:16,991
then I think that
Monkey D. Luffy

392
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:19,359
would be the perfect
opponent for you.

393
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,327
Huh?

394
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:22,897
Hi, I'm Luffy!
So what's your name?

395
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:25,365
Talking about that
idiot in the straw hat?

396
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:27,134
I'm actually
surprised that someone

397
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:30,337
like Roronoa Zoro couldn't
see that man's strength.

398
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,138
See his strength?
What do you mean?

399
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,740
I mean that
Monkey D. Luffy

400
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,309
destroyed the
vicious Arlong along

401
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:38,078
with his fishman pirate
crew in the East Blue.

402
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,279
Then, in the Grand Line,

403
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,748
he managed to bring
down Crocodile,

404
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:44,518
one of the Seven Warlords
of the Sea, all by himself.

405
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:45,652
Warlords of the Sea?

406
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,422
Yeah. And that's not all.
On the sky islands,

407
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:51,625
he beat up a powerful
god named Eneru!

408
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:54,627
And after that, he went on
a rampage in a Marine Base!

409
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:58,399
Against Luffy, even the Marines
had to throw in the towel!

410
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:01,601
I've never seen
another pirate like him!

411
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,970
Don't screw with me!

412
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,271
I'm not in the
mood for any more

413
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:08,742
of these cock-and-bull
stories, you got it?

414
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:10,410
So after hearing all that,

415
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,380
you wanna fight
Luffy, don't you?

416
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:18,552
[chuckles]

417
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:19,753
What are you doing?

418
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:22,789
[chuckles]

419
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:38,505
Huh? Where are we?

420
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:46,947
Is this where that
weird kid lives?

421
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:50,050
This place is
giving me the creeps.

422
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,852
[CHOPPER thinking] Did I
catch a cold or something?

423
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:54,188
I've been shivering
for a while now.

424
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:59,693
If only we had a doctor here.
Wait! That's me!

425
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:03,030
[NAMI thinking]
I bet these pirates

426
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,431
are trying to take me out

427
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:07,234
to the middle of nowhere
so they can steal my gold!

428
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:11,505
I won't let them do it!

429
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,474
[SANJI thinking] Nami's
been shooting glances

430
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:14,775
at me this whole time!

431
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,343
That can only mean one thing:

432
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:19,179
She's fallen in love with me!

433
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,548
Back atcha!

434
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:22,916
[NAMI thinking]
Is that some kind of signal

435
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:24,151
that he's about
to steal my gold?

436
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:26,119
He's freaking me out!

437
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:27,521
Now I see.

438
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,022
[LUFFY]
Butterfly!!

439
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,659
What's up, Robin?
Did you find something?

440
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,629
I just determined the culprit
that stole your memories.

441
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:38,732
Consequently, it's not
the one we thought it was.

442
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:41,535
Wait a second, you mean
it's not that little brat?

443
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:45,972
Now, let's make our way
to the Sea God's Palace.

444
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:47,808
Sea God's Palace?

445
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:49,744
Okay, but why?

446
00:21:49,844 --> 00:21:53,113
Eh-heh! Just a hunch.

447
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:04,591
♪ ending song ♪

448
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:17,431
[NAMI] This was
a terrible idea!

449
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,399
Why did I go
along with you guys?

450
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,702
[USOPP] She's right! Hey!
Let's go back! Come on!

451
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,270
[LUFFY] No way.
Not without Zoro.

452
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,306
[SANJI] That damn swordsman
is coming right for us!

453
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:26,540
[LUFFY] Oh, hey!
You're right!

454
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,042
[SANJI] Hold on!
He's acting strange.

455
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:30,211
[LUFFY] Really?
Zoro is always like this!

456
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:32,179
On the next One Piece:

457
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,547
"Zoro Bares His Fangs!

458
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:35,983
A Savage Animal
Stands in the Way!"

459
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,785
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
