00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060

Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22

Be aware it's "Dangerous"

00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:41,119
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:02:41,152 --> 00:02:45,590
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:50,628
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,698
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:57,268
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43

Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:03,141

of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46

[PIRATE CAPTAIN 375A]
You idiot.

70
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,248
We haven't seen
the sun in two years

00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,284
since Moria stole our shadows.

do you think this means
someone out there

00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:02,487
was able to beat Gecko Moria?

86
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,521
Oh, come on!

87
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:05,990
Like that's bloody likely!

88
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:08,926
Even before Moria became
a Warlord, he went toe-to-toe

89
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,462
with Kaido-one of the
four pirate emperors.

00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,998
You think someone came along
and was able to bring him down?

That's just crazy talk.

finally been lifted!

It just returned? Huh.

You said a pirate stole it ten
years ago, but now it's back?

It's true!

Master! I'm so sorry!

111
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,538
I was so surprised

when I saw it I dropped
your cherished plates!

113
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:33,544
I've hated plates
for a long time now.

But all of a sudden, I seem
to have gotten over all that.

be so much trouble.

you weren't hurt, okay?

[CHOPPER] It looks like
everybody survived.

145
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,286
The sunlight had definitely
begun to erase our existence.

00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:40,221
But our shadows returned,

147
00:09:40,254 --> 00:09:42,290
changing our bodies to
their fully recovered state

just in time.

149
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:45,293
That would follow
the same logic as

150
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:47,561
when we saw Moria
change the shape of Oars

151
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:50,364
by manipulating his shadow.

152
00:09:50,398 --> 00:09:53,801
[MORIA] For example, if I
force his shadow into a ball,

153
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:57,672
Oars will become
a ball as well!

154

[MORIA]
Oars Ball!

155
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:04,912
My theory is that
the shadow must know

what shape its owner is
supposed to be or something.

157

I don't think we'll
ever have to worry

by Moria and his crew.

00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,303
Oh my God! Lola!

177
00:11:02,336 --> 00:11:03,704
How many times do
I have to tell you?

178
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:05,406
I'm not gonna marry you!

179
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:06,841
Would you calm down!

180
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,343
Her shadow's
already left her body.

181
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,512
[ABSALOM]
Doctor Hogback?

182
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,913
What are you doing here?

183
00:11:12,947 --> 00:11:13,981
And what happened to me?

184
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:15,216
How the hell should I know
what happened to you?

185
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:18,486
You probably got your ass kicked
in some embarrassing manner.

186
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,720
I wasn't here!

187
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:22,423
But anyway, something awful
has happened to Master Moria.

188
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:25,726
[ABSALOM]
What?

189
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,396
Master Moria has been
defeated by Straw Hat Luffy?

190
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,598
Shut up!
You're too damn loud!

191
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:33,901
Use your inside voice!
Your inside voice!

192
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:37,605
What the hell are you flying
into a rage for, huh?

193
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:39,673
Doctor Rage-back.

194
00:11:40,508 --> 00:11:43,444
I'm pissed because Thriller Bark
is useless to me now.

195
00:11:43,477 --> 00:11:45,446
But I have no
intention of living out

196
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:47,782
the rest of my life
as a washed up loser.

197
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:49,717
How about you?

198
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,586
Wait. What do you mean?

199
00:11:57,992 --> 00:12:00,795
[ZORO] Luffy got small
again a second ago, huh?

200
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:02,730
[CHOPPER] He told me that
when he uses Third Gear,

201
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,866
his body shrinks for a
while as a side effect.

202
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,468
[USOPP] These new
fighting techniques

203
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:09,670
seem like too much
for his body to handle.

204
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:11,672
He could actually hurt himself.

205
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:13,674
It's really starting
to worry me.

206
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:15,443
Every enemy we
run into is stronger

207
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:16,977
than the last one we faced.

208
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:18,112
He's gonna have
to keep doing this

209
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:20,714
to himself every single time.

210
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:23,451
We need to pull ourselves
together, and soon.

211
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:27,922
Yeah, you're right.

212
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:47,708
Holy crap,
it's a zombie!

213
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:50,010
One of them kept their shadows
even after we beat Moria!

214
00:12:50,044 --> 00:12:52,413
No, I'm just an old man
with serious injuries.

215
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:53,547
That's too damn confusing!

216
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:55,516
Can't you just
be a zombie? Jeez!

217
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:58,552
Aren't you that old
geezer we met in the cemetery?

218
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:00,421
[SPOIL]
It's unbelievable.

219
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:01,889
To think that we'd see the day

220
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:04,959
when we'd be able to
walk under the sun again.

221
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,127
Thank you so much!

222
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,896
I don't know how
we can ever repay you.

223
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,064
[LOLA]
Hey!

224
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:12,066
Old man Spoil!

225
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:13,134
[RISKY BRO. MASK]
Gramps!

226
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,869
[RISKY BRO. BROWN HAIR]
It's the honorary chairman

227
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:16,737
of the Victim's Club!

228
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:20,641
Oh! Well, look who it is!

229
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,976
You're all okay, then?

230
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,477
[LOLA]
Yes! And you?

231
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,012
[SPOIL]
Sure am!

232
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:27,915
[USOPP] I guess they all
know each other or something.

233
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:29,450
[LOLA]
Good. You're all here.

234
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:31,185
I'm sorry we didn't
thank you sooner.

235
00:13:31,218 --> 00:13:33,888
We're really grateful
to every last one of you folks!

236
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:36,157
Sorry we got you all
wrapped up in our mess here!

237
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,092
We knew it when
we first saw you!

238
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,693
You were our only
hope against Moria

239
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:41,629
and that damned
curse he put on us!

240
00:13:41,662 --> 00:13:43,464
So thank you all, very much.

241
00:13:43,497 --> 00:13:44,565
From me and all the members

242
00:13:44,598 --> 00:13:46,767
of the Thriller
Bark Victim's Club.

243
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:54,175
We will never forget
that we owe you our lives.

244
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,744
Thank you, from the
bottom of our hearts!

245
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,047
If you ever need anything,
please let us know.

246
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,549
We may not have much,

247
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:03,250
but what we have is
yours for the taking.

248
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:05,519
And lastly,
and most importantly,

249
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,821
I will allow one of
you to marry me!

250
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,257
Hell no!

251
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,927
Shot down by five people,
all at the same time!

252
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,128
[RISKY BRO. BROWN HAIR]
That's four thousand,

253
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:16,263
four hundred and
forty-nine rejections!

254
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:18,866
There's really no need for
all this "thank you" stuff.

255
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,934
[LOLA]
Who's it gonna be?

256
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:22,203
It's like Luffy told the
old man when we got here.

257
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,370
[LOLA]
You? Or you?

258
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,873
We were fighting for our own
crew and on our own terms.

259
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,074
[LOLA]
Who's the lucky guy?

260
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:29,677
The fact that you guys were
rescued too is just a bonus.

261
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,746
Hey! What's wrong with you?

262
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,849
Someone was finally
showing us a little gratitude!

263
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:37,651
Yeah, she's right!

264
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:40,154
Let us thank you
all proper-like! Okay?

265
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:42,289
You guys might not've
set out to save us,

266
00:14:42,323 --> 00:14:44,758
but we're still glad
you sent Moria packing!

267
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,562
You are? Really?

268
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,231
[USOPP] I shoulda known.

269
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,233
Yeah! And how about
we start off by showing you

270
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,934
where Moria's
treasure is hidden?

271
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:55,970
You guys can take
every piece we find!

272
00:14:56,003 --> 00:14:57,037
You sure did earn it!

273
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:57,938
That's so sweet!

274
00:14:57,972 --> 00:14:59,640
Okay, if you insist!

275
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:05,713
[NAMI]
Oh, no.

276
00:15:05,746 --> 00:15:07,615
I forgot something
really important!

277
00:15:07,648 --> 00:15:08,916
Yeah? What?

278
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:13,721
[NAMI] There's still another
Warlord on the island.

279
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:15,823
Is something wrong?

280
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,958
Everyone, this is serious!

281
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:19,293
[MARINE COMMANDER 375A]
I see.

282
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:28,869
[MARINE COMMANDER 375A]
My greatest fears

283
00:15:28,902 --> 00:15:30,938
have become an
unfortunate reality.

284
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,007
[KUMA]
So it would seem.

285
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:36,310
[USOPP]
Whoa. Who is that guy?

286
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:39,104
[NAMI]
He's here!

287
00:16:04,538 --> 00:16:08,108
Everyone.
Stay calm and listen.

288
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:09,143
Please.

289
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:19,286
[NAMI] During the fight
with Moria and the others,

290
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,089
I forgot to tell you, but...

291
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,227
...there's another one
of them on the island.

292
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,199
One of the Seven
Warlords of the Sea!

293
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:34,134
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

294
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:39,106
Wait. So he's...

295
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,875
...one of...

296
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,411
[CREW] ...the Seven
Warlords of the Sea?

297
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:48,248
[USOPP] There's...
There's no way!

298
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:49,183
[CHOPPER]
What's going on?

299
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,184
They weren't working together,

300
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,453
so why would there need
to be two of them here?

301
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:54,321
[MARINE COMMANDER 375A] Of
course all of this happens just

302
00:16:54,355 --> 00:16:57,324
when we finally chose
a successor for Crocodile.

303
00:16:57,358 --> 00:16:58,492
Losing another Warlord

304
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:01,829
in such a short time
sets a bad example.

305
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:03,564
Can you tell if
he's still breathing?

306
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:05,165
Even in the slightest?

307
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,266
No.

308
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:09,837
[MARINE COMMANDER 375A]
If he is in fact still alive,

309
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,038
we will wait for his recovery

310
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,539
and hope he can
maintain his position

311
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,042
as one of the Seven Warlords.

312
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,578
We will follow up
after such time comes.

313
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,646
[MARINE COMMANDER 375A]
The dignity of the Warlords

314
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,183
would be tarnished if we were
to keep losing them so easily.

315
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:25,319
[MARINE COMMANDER 375A]
It is critical

316
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:28,188
that this news not
reach anyone else.

317
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:31,125
These damned Straw Hats
are such a nuisance.

318
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:32,459
It's him!

319
00:17:32,493 --> 00:17:35,462
The man who stands
just as tall as Moria.

320
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:39,066
The pirate known throughout
the world as "The Tyrant."

321
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,901
Bartholomew Kuma!

322
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:41,535
Aw, no way!

323
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:43,337
That's "Tyrant" Kuma?

324
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,007
Hold on, you mean like the one
who's famous for his brutality?

325
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,242
[MARINE COMMANDER 375A]
I feel I've made my orders

326
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,010
quite clear on this matter.

327
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,015
[MARINE COMMANDER 375A] We
cannot afford to let anyone else

328
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:57,151
know of Moria's defeat.

329
00:17:57,184 --> 00:17:59,953
This is a direct order
from the World Government.

330
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:01,922
Obliterate the Straw Hat Crew

331
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,191
and everyone else
on Thriller Bark.

332
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:05,993
Leave no one alive.

333
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:09,096
Simple enough.

334
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:09,963
Wait.

335
00:18:09,997 --> 00:18:11,432
Did he just say
what I think he said?

336
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,001
He... He's gonna obliterate us?

337
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:48,635
They wanna kill all of us?

338
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,205
I don't understand! What for?

339
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:53,106
Man, this cannot
be happening!

340
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,508
We just managed to
get all our shadows

341
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,910
back from Moria
and now this, too?

342
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:05,619
Oh, come on!

343
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:08,622
How many of these Warlords
do we have to fight?

344
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:11,191
It took everything
we had to defeat Moria.

345
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:13,460
We're worn out and done for!

346
00:19:22,302 --> 00:19:24,071
[ZORO]
Everyone stand back.

347
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:25,973
I'll handle this.

348
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,748
Be careful!

349
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:36,717
He has some strange abilities!

350
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,988
I saw him make someone disappear
with only a touch of his hand!

351
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:48,362
[PERONA] Negative Ghost
and Special Hollow!

352
00:19:57,204 --> 00:19:58,205
Wait, do you mean like,

353
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,307
"poof" and they're
suddenly gone?

354
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,142
So scary!

355
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,411
And he can move
from one location

356
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:06,680
to another in a split second.

357
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,292
You're the
Cat Burglar, aren't you?

358
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:20,460
One of the Straw Hat Pirates?

359
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:22,763
[KUMA] I've heard
that Monkey D. Luffy

360
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:26,099
has an older brother.
Is that true?

361
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,470
[NAMI]
No way!

362
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:32,739
He just suddenly
appeared up there!

363
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,341
Did he teleport?

364
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:38,645
These bad-asses just keep
popping up out of nowhere.

365
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:57,264
Don't let him touch you.

366
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,732
It's dangerous.

367
00:21:30,864 --> 00:21:31,698
What the--?

368
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:37,437
[RANDOM ROLLING PIRATE 375C]
He's right here!

369
00:21:37,471 --> 00:21:39,539
[RANDOM ROLLING PIRATE 375D]
And he's huge!

370
00:21:39,573 --> 00:21:41,308
[RANDOM ROLLING PIRATE 375E]
How'd he do that?

371
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,309
I'll be damned.

372
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,278
The bastard really can
change places instantly!

373
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:47,648
[RISKY BRO. MASK]
Damn it all!

374
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,317
And just when we got
our freedom back, too!

375
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,753
There's no way I'm goin'
down now without a fight!

376
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:54,521
If you think we're
just gonna roll over

377
00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:56,356
and die after all the
crap we've been through,

378
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,325
you got another
thing coming, pal!

379
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,760
Let's take him down!

380
00:21:59,793 --> 00:22:00,494
[RISKY BRO. MASK]
You heard him!

381
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,162
It's do or die!

382
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,030
Stop it, all of you!

383
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:05,298
This guy's way
too strong! Back off!

384
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:28,455
Even the ones he didn't touch!

385
00:22:28,488 --> 00:22:30,657
It's almost like something
shot right through them!

386
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,593
[RANDOM ROLLING PIRATE 375F]
Aww, dammit!

387
00:22:58,218 --> 00:23:00,787
[KUMA]
Pirate Hunter Zoro.

388
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:03,490
Shall I begin the
annihilation with you?

389
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:21,675
[ZORO] What's with this padding
on the palms of his hands?

390
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,211
It's deflecting all my attacks!

391
00:23:24,244 --> 00:23:25,512
[KUMA]
It is my ability

392
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:27,314
and your time is up.

393
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:28,448
[ZORO]
So be it.

394
00:23:28,482 --> 00:23:30,250
I'll give the fight you want.

395
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,752
If I die here and now,

396
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,354
then this is as far
as I was meant to go.

397
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:35,722
On the next One Piece:

398
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:39,392
"It Repels Everything.
Kuma's Paw-Paw Power."

399
00:23:39,426 --> 00:23:41,328
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
