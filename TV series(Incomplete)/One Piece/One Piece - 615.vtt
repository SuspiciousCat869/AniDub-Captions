00:11:46.672 --> 00:11:49.608
And now, before we
lose you completely,

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:52.812
there is one more thing
that I think you should know.

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:56.582
[chuckles]

00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:57.683
[CAESAR CLOWN]
I'm sure you're familiar

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:58.884
with the chemical explosion

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:01.020
that devastated this
island four years ago,

00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:03.489
nearly killing all of these men.

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:11.297
But what you don't know is that
I was the one responsible.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.698
[BROWNBEARD]
Huh?

00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:24.443
[laughing]

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:27.179
[BROWNBEARD] The explosion
wasn't Vegapunk's fault?

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:29.381
This monster hurt all these men,

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:32.318
and then passed himself
off as their savior?

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:37.823
[laughing]

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:39.158
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Huh?

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:40.659
[screams]

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:49.001
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop attacking me!

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:50.703
I need some help here!

00:12:50.736 --> 00:12:53.139
I think Brownbeard's
gone out of his mind!

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:57.076
[BROWNBEARD]
You have to go!

00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.544
Everything that's
happened on this island

00:12:58.577 --> 00:13:00.713
is part of Caesar's sick plan!

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:02.248
Get out while
there's still time!

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:06.352
He's no savior. He's a demon
disguised as a human!

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:07.753
What's your problem?

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.222
That's how you treat
the man who saved you?

00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:17.029
Oh, no! He's going to hurt
someone if we don't stop him.

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:18.597
It's too late now.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.065
Straw Hat must have
done something

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:22.535
to turn him against me!

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:25.004
What now?

00:13:25.037 --> 00:13:26.772
You have to shoot him, quick!

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:29.608
Take him down before
he attacks you, too!

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:33.145
Now, fire!

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:11.717
[laughs]

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:15.421
And now, I'll finish him.

00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:17.456
Gastanet.

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:22.962
[CAESAR CLOWN screams]

00:15:00.432 --> 00:15:04.003
Oh, my, have we escaped the pit?

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:05.304
Are we free?

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:06.305
[LUFFY]
Yeah.

00:15:06.338 --> 00:15:07.506
[MOMONOSUKE sighs]

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:09.308
[MOMONOSUKE] You were able to
scale the wall, I presume?

00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:11.343
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Now, fire!

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:12.011
[MOMONOSUKE gasps]

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:14.480
[gunfire]

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.727
[MOMONOSUKE gasps]

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:29.428
[LUFFY growls]

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:30.696
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:32.932
[CAESAR CLOWN]
And now, I'll finish him.

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:36.068
Right, you stay back here.

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:38.604
Gastanet.

00:15:38.637 --> 00:15:40.406
[gasps]

00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:44.777
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Huh?

00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:49.081
[screaming]

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:50.015
Master!

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:53.919
What the--? It almost got me!

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:55.688
That was close.

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:58.357
What's going on? Who are you?

00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:23.582
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:28.153
[SUBORDINATES]
It's him! Straw Hat Luffy!

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:48.640
[SUBORDINATES gasping]

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:10.029
I owe everything to him.

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:14.333
His kindness saved my life,
as it saved others before me.

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:18.303
Vegapunk was an evil man,
but the Master is our savior.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.106
[CAESAR CLOWN growls]

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.575
Return to the second
floor, everyone!

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.677
The rest of the Straw Hats
and the Navy fools

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:26.678
will be here soon.

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.047
Prepare for the experiment.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:28.981
[SUBORDINATES]
Yes, sir!

00:17:29.014 --> 00:17:31.683
Ready the broadcast
for the brokers.

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:35.020
--[SUBORDINATE E] Let's go!
--[SUBORDINATE F] Hustle!

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:38.157
Well, at any rate,

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.994
I'm sure they'll all die off
in about five years or so.

00:17:42.027 --> 00:17:43.762
[laughs]

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:48.167
Hopefully no one will catch on
and we can bring in a new batch.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.569
It was he! That's
the vile fiend!

00:17:50.602 --> 00:17:53.072
The one who spoke of
harming the children.

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:56.542
He is an evil man!

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.410
I know he is.

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:00.879
[gasps]

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.314
[LUFFY]
How many people have you tricked

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:05.150
into coming to Punk Hazard?

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:07.986
What's your game?
What is this island?

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.221
[gasps]

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:13.659
[growls]

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:16.728
[laughs]

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.030
Very well.

00:18:18.063 --> 00:18:21.266
You have your speculations,
but clearly you know nothing.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.502
Shall I tell you
the island's secret?

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:24.903
We need to work faster!

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:25.704
[SUBORDINATE Q]
Hurry up!

00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:26.872
Quick, check the video!

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:28.207
Get the elevator up now!

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.945
[SUBORDINATES shouting]

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:34.713
Well, Straw Hat.

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:38.550
You see, this island is
much like gas or air.

00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:41.353
It exists, but it's invisible.

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:43.522
Do you get it now?

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:45.824
[gasps]

00:18:47.826 --> 00:18:49.194
Just think!

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:51.797
An unfindable island,
impossible to log.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.432
What place could
be more suitable

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:56.468
for the work of an
underground community?

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:59.071
This is the epicenter
of black science.

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:02.207
Here, I can perform all the
forbidden experiments I want

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:05.744
and gather test subjects
by any means necessary.

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:08.413
I have backers in high places
who are more than happy

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:10.983
to sweep any misdeeds
under the rug.

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:13.452
So the rest of the world
remains oblivious.

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:16.488
[laughs]

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:20.058
[CAESAR CLOWN] Scream as loud as
you want. Cry a river of tears.

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:22.327
No one will come to the rescue.

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:24.663
For all your bluster,
you don't know a damn thing

00:19:24.696 --> 00:19:27.432
about this island and
its dangers, Straw Hat.

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:29.902
Be smart and don't
involve yourself further.

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:31.737
You're signing your
own death sentence.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:32.804
You fool.

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:35.541
Allying with Law was a bad idea.

00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:38.343
His objective is to get
his hands on SAD.

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:40.512
That's why he's having
you kidnap me,

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:44.883
because he knows I'm the only
person who can create it.

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:48.187
What's SAD? Do you know?

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.723
I produce it here and ship it
off to Don Quixote Doflamingo.

00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:54.993
That's right, the world's
most dangerous Warlord.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:20:00.332
He owns a factory in which
SAD is processed into Smile.

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:03.569
But you don't know what
Smile is either, do you?

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:05.003
I'll enlighten you.

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.371
It's a scientific breakthrough

00:20:06.405 --> 00:20:09.474
that may change
the world forever.

00:20:09.508 --> 00:20:11.944
You see, Smile is a
man-made Devil Fruit

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:15.347
of the Zoan variety.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.051
Anyone who seeks power
yearns for such a fruit.

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:23.722
[CAESAR CLOWN Doflamingo
capitalizes on this desire

00:20:23.755 --> 00:20:28.527
by selling Smiles to major
players in the new world.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.829
From what I hear,
one of the Four Emperors

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:32.564
has already begun using Smile

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:36.068
to create a personal army
of Devil Fruit eaters.

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:39.705
Doesn't it just send a
chill down your spine?

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:41.373
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:42.774
So, are you beginning
to understand

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:45.143
what you're dealing
with now, huh?

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:46.144
Just by coming here,

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:48.213
you've interfered with
Doflamingo's business.

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:50.482
That will anger a great
many powerful people,

00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:52.517
ones you don't want to cross.

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:54.219
They will act, and when they do,

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.588
it will shake the
world to its core.

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:59.091
That chaos is just
what Law is after.

00:20:59.124 --> 00:21:00.592
You're both fools!

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:02.361
These people are
out of your league.

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:04.329
You're playing with
fire, Straw Hat.

00:21:04.363 --> 00:21:05.831
[laughs]

00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:09.167
Capture me if you can,
but I'm well protected.

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:12.137
Doflamingo. The Four Emperors.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.373
Tell me, do you truly
have the guts

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:15.941
to pick a fight with them?

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:17.676
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:19.678
I don't think you so, Straw Hat.

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:21.813
If you want to run,
then now's the time.

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:25.083
You should get out of my way
while you still have a chance.

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:31.123
[laughing]

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:34.993
[LUFFY]
What'd you say?

00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:42.234
[gasps]

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:56.548
Incredible!

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:06.491
I'm pickin' a fight.

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:09.194
That's what I've been
doin' my whole life!

00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:19.571
[NARRATOR] Caesar's Gas-Gas
Fruit may be potent,

00:22:19.604 --> 00:22:21.073
but its power is no match

00:22:21.106 --> 00:22:23.742
for the enraged Luffy
and his flying fists.

00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:26.478
Elsewhere, Smoker faces
an unavoidable defeat

00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:28.780
as he realizes how
helpless he is to combat

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:32.451
the devastating Haki wielded
by his opponent, Vergo.

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:34.353
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:34.386 --> 00:22:38.623
"A Surprising Outcome!
White Hunter vs. Vergo!"

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:41.326
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
