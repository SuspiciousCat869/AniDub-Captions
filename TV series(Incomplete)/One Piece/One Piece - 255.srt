1
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:07,041
The government was
planning on attacking us,

2
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:11,378
but Robin turned herself over
to CP9 so we would be safe!

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,651
Then Robin was lying
this whole time?

4
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,224
I won't let Robin die!

5
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,174
One-Sword Style!
Thirty-Six Caliber Phoenix!

6
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,590
It's Paulie!

7
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:04,598
Hurry!

8
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,175
Only one thing to do.

9
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,445
We set off and rescue
them right away!

10
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,349
I had a feeling you'd say that.

11
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:24,784
Let's go.

12
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,565
Hey, help us out, Rope Guy.

13
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,467
We need a boat.

14
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,236
Actually, we need a sea train.

15
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,337
Do you have
another one of those?

16
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,442
There is no "other" sea train.

17
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,811
The Puffing Tom
is one of a kind.

18
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,180
The man who made
that train's a legend.

19
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,449
It's miracle it
got finished at all.

20
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:59,119
So, sorry, I can't pull another
Sea Train out of my ass.

21
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,055
Okay, then lend us a ship!

22
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,691
The strongest and fastest
one you guys've got!

23
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,527
Damn it, would you
give it a rest already?!

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,695
Are you stupid?!

25
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,697
You saw what just happened!

26
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,599
You barely survived
that wave on land

27
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,434
and you wanna go out to sea?!

28
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,169
I don't care how
good the ship is...

29
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,537
you wouldn't last five minutes!

30
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,538
No kidding!

31
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,238
You idiot!

32
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,608
Even during a normal Aqua Laguna

33
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,210
no ship has ever made
it through the storm.

34
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,279
And this year,
it's anything but normal.

35
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,282
Just look at what happened
to the backstreets.

36
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:32,386
This is the first time the waves
have ever done damage like that.

37
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,421
Water Seven was built to last.

38
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,324
If it starts shaking, then
we damn well better listen.

39
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,260
I'm telling you,
even if you went out there

40
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,396
in our biggest galleon,
you'd be smashed to smithereens.

41
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,598
I'm not gonna let
you sail out there

42
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,234
if I know you won't
make it back alive.

43
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,302
Wait 'til morning.

44
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,307
We'll lend you a ship as
soon as the storm passes.

45
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,576
The rest of you head to
the evacuation shelter.

46
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,279
We're done searching
for missing people.

47
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,713
We can't stand around
like idiots waiting

48
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,215
for a wave to hit us.

49
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,583
Right!

50
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,119
Hold on.

51
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,255
If we wait until
after the storm settles

52
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,758
we won't make it in time
to save Robin, will we?

53
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,330
I heard about Enies Lobby
long before we came here.

54
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,098
When you said it was
a government island,

55
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,667
it made me remember something.

56
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,901
It's not just a base.

57
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:24,404
It's also where the Gates of
Justice are located, isn't it?

58
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:28,295
Well?

59
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,097
I'm not mistaken, am I?

60
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,268
Gates of Justice?

61
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,338
Enies Lobby is known
as a "Judicial island."

62
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:38,572
But that's all a lie.

63
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,709
The court they have
there is only for show.

64
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,711
The truth is, if
you've been taken there,

65
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,447
then you're already
considered guilty.

66
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,549
When you arrive the
government walks you

67
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,818
through an empty courtroom,
leading to a pair of

68
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:56,056
cold, steel doors that
tower above the entire island.

69
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,527
Those doors are known
as the Gates of Justice.

70
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,729
The criminals who
walk through them

71
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,530
must abandon all hope.

72
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,798
Once they reach the other side,

73
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,468
they'll never see the
light of day again.

74
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,236
Once you set sail
beyond those doors,

75
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,505
there are only two
destinations you can reach.

76
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,341
Neither of which you
are ever likely to leave.

77
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,611
One is Navy Headquarters

78
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,146
where the strongest
military powers

79
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,449
in the world gather
in the name of justice.

80
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,053
The other is Impel Down
an underwater prison,

81
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:29,356
filled with torture chambers
and execution blocks.

82
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,592
No matter how
vicious they may be,

83
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,361
the criminals imprisoned
there can only wait for death.

84
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,098
In other words
going to Enies Lobby

85
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,501
is no different than
a death sentence.

86
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:44,371
There's no trial, no justice
and no hope of escape.

87
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,172
Am I right?

88
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,078
Robin has a bounty on her head.

89
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,048
No matter where they take her,
she'll face death, or worse.

90
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,449
Every second we
sit here talking,

91
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,419
she gets one step closer
to the Gates of Justice.

92
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,555
Don't you dare tell us
to wait until tomorrow!

93
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,130
If you know that much already,

94
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,333
I've only got one thing to say.

95
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,768
Even if the sea was
calm and you were able

96
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,505
to set sail that's the last
place you should ever go.

97
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,773
Don't forget, you people are

98
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,642
wanted criminals just
the same as your friend.

99
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,614
Just like you said,
Enies Lobby is the front door

100
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,283
to the World Government's
own personal playground.

101
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,417
They've drawn battle lines

102
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:33,554
around that place that
should never ever be crossed.

103
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,423
Regardless of how they
feel about their crewmates,

104
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,791
no pirate would be stupid enough

105
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,094
to launch a
rescue mission there.

106
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,062
They know what would happen.

107
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,697
Picking a fight in that place

108
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,400
is like declaring war
on the entire Navy!

109
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,641
Hey. I know how you must
feel, but Paulie's right!

110
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,176
You can't leave during
Aqua Laguna, anyway!

111
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,678
You'll be dead before
you even get there!

112
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,213
There's no point in throwing
your lives away over this!

113
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,784
Luffy.

114
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,352
Fine then.

115
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,220
We'll steal a ship!

116
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,391
Our crewmate is counting on us!

117
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,331
Don't try to get in our way!

118
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,733
We're leaving now!

119
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,339
Whoa, even the waves got mad!

120
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,144
Whoa!

121
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,345
Is he gonna fight us?

122
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,179
That sure was scary!

123
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,249
Fine, then.

124
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,417
You want a fight, you got it.

125
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,659
All of you.

126
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,260
Stop it!

127
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:50,664
Kokoro?

128
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,567
Stop bein' such a
damn fool, Straw Hat.

129
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,471
Like it or not,
Paulie's right on this one.

130
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,040
Shut up granny,
it's none of your business!

131
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,676
You sure about that, boy?

132
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,745
Either way, these
folks are just trying

133
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,481
to stop you from
killing yourself.

134
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:10,417
The point is no
matter how mad you are,

135
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,153
no ship can handle Aqua Laguna.

136
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:17,424
Only a sea train made by a
legendary man stands a chance.

137
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,426
I know that, but
I don't have any choice,

138
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:23,330
since the only sea train in the
world has left town already!

139
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:27,401
If you're prepared to
die, then that's fine.

140
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,169
Just come along with me.

141
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,472
We'll brave the storm
on my sea train.

142
00:09:59,266 --> 00:09:59,833
Who's that guy?

143
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,036
I dunno.

144
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,703
You idiots!

145
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:03,937
Don't just stand there!

146
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:08,074
If he's not wearing a uniform,
then he must be an intruder!

147
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,414
Get him!

148
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:17,450
I guess playing innocent
doesn't work in here.

149
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,563
And here I thought
I could get out of a fight.

150
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,165
Oh well, it's not my funeral.

151
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,637
Sanji?!

152
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,205
Hold it!

153
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,745
You think we're gonna
let you get away with that?

154
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,746
If you're <i>smart.</i>

155
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:58,592
Collier Frit!

156
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:06,767
Wait, you didn't
hijack the Sea Train

157
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,336
just to rescue <i>me,</i> did you?

158
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,339
I don't even know
what you're doing here.

159
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,580
Also, what's your name again,

160
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:22,149
I don't believe we've
actually met before, have we?

161
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,484
Oh, are you kidding me?

162
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,019
You jerk.

163
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:28,222
Bingo!

164
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,291
Transponder snails!

165
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:31,358
Hmm, okay.

166
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:34,228
This must be a communications
room or something.

167
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,598
Lucky I ran into
this place so soon.

168
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,133
Those guys I beat
up in the last cart

169
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,668
only had a bunch
of useless crap.

170
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,603
Masks and
costumes and stuff.

171
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:46,106
Anyway, now that I have this
I can get in touch with Nami.

172
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,040
Let me guess.

173
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,376
He's one of your
pirate friends, isn't he?

174
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,544
EX friend.

175
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,513
The question is, who are you?

176
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,182
I'm the face of
Water Seven's underworld.

177
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,317
The ship dismantler, Franky.

178
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,789
So you're the bastard
who beat up Usopp, huh?

179
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:02,690
He may be dead to me now,

180
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,259
but he was part of
our crew, back then!

181
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,695
How many pieces you
want me to cut you into?

182
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,430
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

183
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:12,633
It's not like that now, a lot
of stuff has changed since then!

184
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,834
Hey, punk!

185
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,769
You're lucky I'm tied up!

186
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,305
C'mon man, that
line's getting old.

187
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,673
Seriously, he's a good guy.

188
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,776
He saved the Merry
at least for a while.

189
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,679
Oh yeah.

190
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:29,450
The Merry was--

191
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:30,618
Whoa.

192
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:33,754
C'mon buddy, you can't get
all sad n' mopey on me now!

193
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,656
Hey! Blondie! Untie me!

194
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,092
Pretty Please?

195
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,159
You can spend the
rest of your life

196
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,562
in that potato
sack for all I care!

197
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,763
Screw you!

198
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,499
I said "pretty please" what
the hell else do you want?!

199
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:46,700
Stop it!

200
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,168
No more fighting, guys!

201
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,269
Look!

202
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,306
If we keep yelling, then the
marine's are gonna come!

203
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,807
Yeah? Then shut up!

204
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,507
Say what?!

205
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,543
They shoulda gagged both of you!

206
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:57,077
Whatever!

207
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,412
Just untie me, okay?

208
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,246
Don't order me around!

209
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,514
Stop fighting already!!

210
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,588
Captain T-Bone?

211
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,122
What are you--?

212
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,151
Franky's with them too?

213
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:40,721
Yes, sir.

214
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:43,223
But I'm afraid that the Sea
Train has already departed.

215
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,692
Paulie and the other
guys are out looking

216
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:47,694
for Straw Hat and
his friends but no luck.

217
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,133
Now that we all know that
Robin needs saving then

218
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,503
there's no limit to
what we can accomplish!

219
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,776
A secret base?!

220
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,747
It's been more than 8 years
since anyone's set foot in here.

221
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,651
And nobody's touched the
sea train for more than 12.

222
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,052
Let's go, Chopper!

223
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,119
Right!

224
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:16,290
I'm warning you, the thing
might not run anymore!

225
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:16,924
What?

226
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,291
You better be kidding me!

227
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,765
Now now, settle down, boys.

228
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,300
You can run as fast as you like,

229
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,570
but you're not getting
inside without the key!

230
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:30,537
Huh?

231
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,239
Now that's weird.

232
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,608
It's open-

233
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,512
Whoa-hoa!

234
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:39,780
Awesome!

235
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,082
Check out the face!

236
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,253
It's so cool!

237
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:50,224
Unlike the Puffing Tom,
this one here's a crazy train.

238
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,660
Its name is "Rocketman."

239
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:56,463
Comes with no guarantees,
so board at your own risk.

240
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,398
Rocketman!

241
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:58,632
Sounds fast!

242
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,300
Neat-o!

243
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,304
Did you have to add the face?

244
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:06,506
Don't worry, it may be
mean, but it won't bite.

245
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,679
Hey look, it's Ice Pops!

246
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:13,380
Hello there, Straw Hat.

247
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,249
So you're okay after all.

248
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:18,052
It seems your friend's
faith was well-founded.

249
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,820
I assume you brought
them here, Kokoro?

250
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,623
The question is,
what are you doing here?

251
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:25,459
You've been through a
lot today, you need rest!

252
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,361
Mmwell let's just say you

253
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,496
and I were thinking
the same thing.

254
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:33,066
We have a soft spot
for idiots, don't we?

255
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:40,740
Go ahead.

256
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,543
I just finished servicing it.

257
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:46,112
Water and coal have been loaded
and the steam's building up now.

258
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:50,450
Thanks for getting it ready
for us, we owe you one!

259
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,321
I wouldn't celebrate
yet, if I were you.

260
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,523
You might not even
survive the ride.

261
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,693
This was our failed prototype
before we made the Puffing Tom.

262
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,529
No matter how you tune it,
you can't control its speed.

263
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:06,367
In other words,
it's a runaway train.

264
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,501
That's fine!

265
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,469
It can go as fast as it wants!

266
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,508
Hurry up, let's go!

267
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,476
Get on already!

268
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,646
We're leaving as soon as
Nami gets here, Granny!

269
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,317
Ah man.

270
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,219
Luffy, are you okay?

271
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,821
You've been kinda shaky on
your feet since we found you.

272
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:30,190
He probably just
lost too much blood.

273
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,292
Maybe.

274
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,694
I am feeling kinda dizzy.

275
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:35,696
I think I need some meat.

276
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,398
Hurry, this way!

277
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,167
Wait!

278
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,168
I don't see why you have to go

279
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,338
all the way down here
just to eat your dinner!

280
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,205
He's right!

281
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,640
If you're hungry, eat now!

282
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,342
You think all that
food is for me?!

283
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,443
What?!

284
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,045
Sorry I took so long!

285
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:51,912
Nami.

286
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:54,048
Hey, save the
small talk for later!

287
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,417
Get on board so we can go!

288
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,785
Wow, amazing!

289
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:59,787
So there's another
sea train huh?

290
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,490
It was hiding here all
this time and we never knew!

291
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,758
This is a real surprise!

292
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,694
You're the one who
told us we have to hurry.

293
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,829
Why are you the
last one to get here!

294
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,631
And what's with that big bag?

295
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:12,433
I brought you food and drinks.

296
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,067
I'm sorry I just yelled at you.

297
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,104
He's ready to go!

298
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,440
You'll shoot out of
the canal into the ocean.

299
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,175
If you can latch onto
the railway after that,

300
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,543
it should be a good start.

301
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,311
Don't you worry a bit!

302
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:27,281
I like to drink,
but I take my job seriously!

303
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:28,215
You just stay here

304
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,284
and give that body
of yours a good rest!

305
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:31,318
Sounds fine to me.

306
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,420
And while I'm taking
care of these pirate folk,

307
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:36,423
I hope you don't mind watching
Gonbe and Chimney for me.

308
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:40,127
Yes, that's fine.

309
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,797
Don't go troubling
yourself over him, either.

310
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,300
That boy got hit by
a sea train, you know.

311
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,370
If he can survive that,
I'm sure he'll be okay!

312
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,172
Besides, we've got the
King of Pirates on our side.

313
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,673
We can't lose.

314
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:59,479
Straw Hat!

315
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,083
Who's there?

316
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,719
The Franky Family!

317
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:11,225
We're kind of busy right now.

318
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,160
Please! Straw Hat.

319
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,529
You guys gotta take us with you!

320
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,231
The people from Galley-La said

321
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:21,068
you were gonna take a
sea train to Enies Lobby!

322
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,103
Those government
bastards took Franky!

323
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,806
They took our bro away from us!

324
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,740
We wanna go,

325
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,777
but we can't get through
Aqua Laguna alone!

326
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,379
You sure you wanna
pick a fight on their turf?

327
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,348
I'll fight anyone, anywhere!

328
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,450
We gotta get our bro back!

329
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,518
I don't care what happens

330
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,753
to us as long as
we can save him!

331
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,422
We're begging you!

332
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,424
Please help us, Straw Hat!

333
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,492
We'll do anything!

334
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,829
If we don't hurry,
bro is done for!

335
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,764
You've gotta be kidding me.

336
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:56,002
You steal our money, beat up our
friend, then ask us for help?!

337
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:03,410
I don't care.

338
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:06,747
Even if it's wrong,
I'm still begging you.

339
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,517
I'll give up my pride
if I can save him!

340
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:25,432
C'mon.

341
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,800
Hurry up!

342
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:32,639
Thank you so much.

343
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:36,243
Are you sure about this?!

344
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,746
Eh, it's fine.

345
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:40,748
Thank you.

346
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,749
Thanks, Straw Hat.

347
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,319
Well, let's go!

348
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:49,390
Ah we don't have to
get on the train, though.

349
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:50,524
We'll just hop on our king bulls

350
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,727
and head out to sea the
same time the train takes off.

351
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,797
All you gotta do is let the
bulls catch a ride on your tail.

352
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,666
What're king bulls?

353
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,267
Anyway, we're off!

354
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:00,801
Thanks!

355
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,068
