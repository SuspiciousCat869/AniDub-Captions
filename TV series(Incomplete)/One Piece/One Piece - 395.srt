countless souls to the seas.

[GOLD ROGER] You want my

little time to save her.

so they're about to
sell him off at an auction

58

It does seem farfetched.

certain it's actually him.

[MARINE OFFICER 395A]
Yes, sir.

So how should we
handle this, Vice-Admiral?

68
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,218
Should I report it to
Fleet Admiral Sengoku?

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,221
[GARP] No. I intend
to handle this myself.

70
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,889
Don't tell anyone about this.

71
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,557
Not even Sengoku.

72

And make sure your men
keep their mouths shut.

what if it really
is the Dark King?

Oh, it's him, all right.
There's no doubt about it.

This isn't the
first sighting of him

on the islands
that's been reported.

78
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,738
He's probably racked up
some gambling debt

and sold himself
in order to pay it off.

Rayleigh may be an old man,

81

approach him carefully,

worth 70 million berries?

176
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,694
That's why everyone
goes after mermaids.

177
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,862
It's their
get-rich-quick scheme.

178
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,614
[DUVAL]
That's a lotta berries.

179
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,908
[DUVAL]
Naturally, once they get bought,

180
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,827
they lose every ounce
of their freedom.

181
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,871
They usually wind up as
decorations for some rich snob,

182
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,748
living out their lives
in cramped fish tanks

183
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,874
as exotic eye candy.

184
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,043
[SANJI] Why the hell
are you even telling me this?

185
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,253
Well...

186
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,630
I say "living," but you really
can't call it that, can you?

187
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,091
If that's how you feel,
hurry up and find her!

188
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,391
We've done a thorough search

189
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,227
of all the kidnapping rings
in Grove number 20, sir.

190
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,395
They seem clean.

191
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,897
No one's heard anything about
a mermaid getting taken.

192
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,858
[FISH RIDER 395B] Nothin'
on the grapevine here, either.

193
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,943
[FISH RIDER 395C]
Damn. Same here.

194
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,737
Nothin' even close to a lead.

195
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,324
Make this thing go faster!

196
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,658
Will you get off my ass, kid?

197
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,576
She ain't a bird.

198
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,995
She needs a running
start to get going.

199
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,754
Camie! Where are you?

200
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,051
[MONKEY CAPTAIN]
It pisses me off!

201
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,761
Geez! It was a damn giant!

202
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,846
How often do you
find a giant sleeping?

203
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,389
It was the easiest
catch of my life,

204
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,017
but it was still a pain
hauling the thing here!

205
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,020
A giant like that
would normally be

206
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,397
the main attraction and
we'd all be billionaires!

207
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,357
But no!

208
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,026
Some jerk's gotta go
and bring a mermaid in

209
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,278
at the last minute
before the auction starts!

210
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,197
Ah, I need a drink!

211
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,115
Hold on!

212
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,117
Now who brought in the mermaid?

213
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,246
This is Fish number 5 here!

214
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,791
Attention all Rosy Life Riders!

215
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,625
Come in, Riders!

216
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,710
We've got an ID
on the kidnapper!

217
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,795
It was Peterman!

218
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,922
Word is he sold the mermaid
to the auction house

219
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,298
on Grove number 1!

220
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,008
Wait. It was Peterman?

221
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,093
Do you know where to go?

222
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,427
Yes I do!

223
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,763
Yohohohoho!

224
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,808
Must we fly so fast?
It's terrifying!

225
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,854
I just hope she hasn't
been sold off already.

226
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,774
Hurry up!

227
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,401
Grove number 1
is right around the corner!

228
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,944
Just leave it to me!

229
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,071
[FISH RIDER 395C] We're
headin' for the auction house!

[HACHI]
Nyuu!

00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,073
You mean we know where she is?

232
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,366
Thank goodness!

Get a move on!

[ZORO] I'm tryin'
to get back to my ship.

You fellas know where
Grove number 1 is?

237
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,217
[BOUNTY HUNTER 395A]
Well, sure we do!

Oh, I'll tell you all right,

Your one hundred twenty
million bounty is mine!

Uh, lemme think.

244
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,869
Which way's Grove 1?

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,037
[DISCO]
All right! Moving right along!

Up next. Entry number 6
for your consideration!

And someone read off
the auction schedule.

251
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,719
[FISH RIDER 386A]
It started at four.

252
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,888
It's been going
for 30 minutes now.

253

Are we gonna make it in time?

254
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,891
[DUVAL]
Oh, we'll make it.

255
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,351
A mermaid's always considered
a big ticket attraction,

256
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,896
so they won't auction her
off until the second half.

257
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,272
Nothing to worry about!

[SANJI] Just take the
fastest route you can.

259
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,067
You're a lot slower
than the flying fish.

and take it easy there,

There's a reason why I'm
the boss of this team, y'know.

00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,494
Did you notice me
change direction

264
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,913
back when we found out
where the mermaid was?

265
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,748
Uh, no, I didn't.

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,125

And that's because...

Hey, boss.

Isn't that the Straw Hat
crew that just walked in?

356
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,331
Yeah, but the Straw Hat
captain ain't with them.

00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,041
Shame, since I'd like
to see if that bastard's

Curse my luck!

Why did I have to go
and blow my entire budget

369
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,734
on the first female
human they carted out?

370
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,945
This one is clearly
so much better.

371
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,614
That really is a shame.

Is this what they're
gonna do to Camie?

I already told you.
We're getting Camie back.

It's gotta be worth
at least 200 million.

market price for mermaids?

That's more than enough,

but there's no way
I can pay all that back!

talking about, Hachi?

Are you Camie's legal
guardian or something?

Nyuu, no, that's
not what I meant.

Camie's our friend

398
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,933
and we'll do whatever
it takes to get her back,

Anyone got a problem with that?

401
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,478
Of course not!

This can't be real.

If they do that...

with a capital T, captain.

It finally makes sense.

But there's no way Whitebeard

won't retaliate.

425
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,455
