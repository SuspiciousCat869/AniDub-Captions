1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,671
It's the One Piece
treasure giveaway!

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:06,473
The first key letter to be
on the lookout for is...

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:10,210
We'll tell you how to enter
at the end of the show!

4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:18,485
Forget about it--I won't even
let an ant through this gate!

5
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,022
While fighting to
open the Front Gate

6
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:25,759
on Enies Lobby's Main Island,
the Franky Family were stopped

7
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:29,796
in their tracks by the giant
gatekeepers Oimo and Kashii.

8
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,067
Timber Hitch Tug!

9
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,748
However, Paulie and Zambai
reversed the tide of battle,

10
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,351
and began to
force the gate open.

11
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,353
Luffy had already passed
over the gate himself,

12
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,488
but was unable to make
any progress thanks

13
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,457
to the overwhelming
number of Marines

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,391
that hounded him at every turn.

15
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,139
Five men?

16
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,208
We've only lost
five of our guards?!

17
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,409
Jeez!

18
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,678
How in the world could you
make such an obvious mistake?!

19
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,480
Five hundred.

20
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:24,718
Lucci's party escorted Franky
and Robin to the Tower of Law,

21
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,520
where Spandam was
eagerly awaiting them.

22
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:34,228
It's good to have you back,
Lucci, Kaku, Blueno, Kalifa.

23
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,429
That's harassment.

24
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,565
All I did was say your name!

25
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,799
Needless to say,

26
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,370
I'm extremely pleased with your
performance in this mission.

27
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,774
By the way, although it
isn't exactly a reward for all

28
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:50,344
your hard work, I do have
something I want to give you.

29
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:53,714
But we can take
care of that later.

30
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:57,351
For now, let's
meet them, shall we?

31
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:00,186
The hope of the entire world.

32
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,824
Nearby, the Straw Hat pirates
sat on the sea train Rocketman,

33
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,561
anxiously awaiting their moment
to charge onto the island.

34
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,497
You ready, ladies and gents?

35
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:14,201
The time has finally arrived.

36
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,235
I'm gonna need you

37
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,372
to take out that iron fence,
okay Samurai Man?

38
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,074
Just leave it to me.

39
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:32,820
Hurry up!

40
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,654
Move it!

41
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,091
You too, big guy!

42
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,367
Coo-Coo?

43
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,374
Chapapa-papa!

44
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,751
I couldn't be happier!

45
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:04,952
Amazing work.

46
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:10,491
You survived the "accident"
eight years ago, Cutty Flam.

47
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,560
And now, I have you as well.

48
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:18,265
The world's most dangerous
woman, Nico Robin.

49
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,116
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

50
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,758
What a fantastic feeling!

51
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,193
It's so unfortunate.

52
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,294
The rest of the
world may never know

53
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,131
what a glorious accomplishment
CP9 achieved today.

54
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,401
One of the drawbacks of being
a secret agency and all that.

55
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,804
Yes, a pity.

56
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,040
Honestly, the news of your
capture could take years

57
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,309
to reach the public.

58
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,811
The "justice" those old geezers

59
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,615
in the current World Government
dole out is far too lenient!

60
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:51,585
Without sacrifice,
goals cannot be achieved.

61
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,421
I mean, this is world
peace we're working for--

62
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,724
it's not easy!

63
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:59,193
Surely there can't be
an issue with sacrificing

64
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,729
a few fools along the
way who hinder our work

65
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,364
for the sake of
the greater good.

66
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,298
Right?

67
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,366
You know, if everyone
would just give us

68
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,669
what we ask for obediently
and without question.

69
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,372
Then we wouldn't need to
go to such extreme measures.

70
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:14,174
Like we had to with poor Tom!

71
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,446
That traitor deserved it!

72
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,649
Crazy bastard!

73
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:26,186
Tom put his life on the line
to protect those blueprints!

74
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,089
Because idiots like you exist!

75
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:35,329
What are you doing?!

76
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:38,131
Don't just sit there, help me!!

77
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,738
Kumadoriii!

78
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,306
Yoyoi!

79
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,448
What is your desiiiiiiire?

80
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,382
Isn't it obvious?!

81
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,350
Help me!!

82
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:57,685
Make him stop!

83
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,587
Saa. Saa.

84
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,122
Saa!

85
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,524
Yoyoi!

86
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,604
Uhhh.

87
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,572
No need to thank me, Chief.

88
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,641
Nooo neeeeeed.

89
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:36,156
Now Gum-Gum Gatling!

90
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,259
Now Gum-Gum Whip!

91
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,130
Giant Sickle!

92
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:49,236
Bell!

93
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:53,073
Hammer!

94
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:56,610
Bazooka!

95
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:06,120
Gum-Gum Stamp!

96
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,222
This is Main Island,
calling the Chief.

97
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,623
Spandam, come in!

98
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,292
I repeat! Come in!

99
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,192
It's no good!

100
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,294
No signal!

101
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,195
Is that so?

102
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,163
Maybe he's got the
receiver off again.

103
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,398
Awww, seriously?!

104
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:20,434
Could his timing be any worse?!

105
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,134
Hey!

106
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,037
Anyone see where Straw Hat went?

107
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,638
He's right beneath you!

108
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,506
What?!

109
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,640
He is?!

110
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,245
Everyone attack
him from all sides!

111
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,112
Now!

112
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:32,613
There he is!

113
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:33,514
We got him!

114
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:33,948
Damn!

115
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,348
I'm cornered!

116
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:47,794
Now Gum-Gum Volcano!

117
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:12,786
What?!

118
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:13,821
No way!!

119
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,388
The walls are falling!

120
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,425
Run!

121
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:27,534
Now Gum-Gum Gatling!

122
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,470
Oh, no!

123
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:36,443
Chief Spandam!

124
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,544
Please, come in!

125
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,679
We need your orders, sir!

126
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,514
We can't stop Straw Hat Luffy!

127
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:43,884
Get ready!

128
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,519
He's heading towards
the courthouse!

129
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,121
We need those defenses lined up!

130
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,055
Move it, men!

131
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,590
Shut up, already!

132
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,058
What's with all the yelling?

133
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,827
You guys woke me up!

134
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,630
Chief Justice!

135
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,498
Yep!

136
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:58,565
You got it!

137
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,265
That's me!

138
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,036
Chief Justice of Enies Lobby!

139
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,304
On the left!

140
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:06,507
My name is Left Baskerville!

141
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,808
On the right!

142
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,678
I am Right Baskerville!

143
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,546
And, located in the center,

144
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,816
I am known as Central Freeway!

145
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,117
Say what?!

146
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,618
Uh.

147
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:18,686
Chief Justice.

148
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,820
We've got a problem.

149
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:22,156
There's a pirate on a rampage
on the Main Island, sir.

150
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,223
But we can't get in touch

151
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:25,759
with Chief Spandam to get
an update on our orders.

152
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,595
Please, sir, take
command on his behalf!

153
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,063
A pirate, you say?

154
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:32,799
All pirates are guilty!

155
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,736
There hasn't been a trial yet!

156
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,139
Even so, I think he's innocent!

157
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:39,740
Then.

158
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,542
I'll be neutral.

159
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:42,476
Death!

160
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,613
Say what?!

161
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:46,647
Chief Justice!

162
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,115
There's trouble, sir!

163
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,283
I just received a report.

164
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,217
The Straw Hat's accomplices

165
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,653
have taken out Kaahii
at the Front Gate.

166
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,655
Oimo's still fighting,
but won't last much longer!

167
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:55,355
Say what?!

168
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,225
That gate must not be breached!

169
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:02,363
Send one hundred Watchdogs
to that location immediately!

170
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:08,202
Sir!

171
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,270
We're in trouble!

172
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:11,171
Our 5 minute window is up!

173
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:11,605
Damn!

174
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,606
Hurry!

175
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,775
We've got to get that
gate open for Rocketman!

176
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,210
I will never let you through!

177
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:19,313
Okay guys!

178
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,214
We picked the gate's lock!

179
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,150
All you have to do
now is push it open!

180
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:23,617
What?!

181
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,551
Oh, crap!

182
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:25,252
Nice work!

183
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:25,819
You heard her!

184
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,153
Move it!

185
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:31,392
You stay away from that gate!

186
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:34,128
Rope Action!

187
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,595
Top Knot!

188
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:40,300
Whoa!

189
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:42,202
Those Galley-La
foremen are incredible!

190
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,205
You think this puny
rope is gonna hold me?!

191
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:47,508
Franky Family!

192
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,375
Pull!

193
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,076
Yeah!

194
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:51,579
No problem!

195
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:52,246
Gomorrah!

196
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:52,813
Sodom!

197
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,614
Grab that rope!

198
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:02,589
Move it, Franky Family!

199
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,092
Don't stop until that
gate is wide open!

200
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,527
Oi, oi, oi!

201
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,428
Hold on!

202
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,228
Slow down!

203
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,530
I'm getting dizzy!

204
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,398
Push the gate!

205
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,338
No!

206
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:18,405
Impossible!

207
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,140
The gates are opening!

208
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:23,077
What the hell is Oimo doing?!

209
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,211
A little more.

210
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,491
They've breached the gate!

211
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,076
Hey! Hey!

212
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,116
There's no way.

213
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,451
Is that a sea train?

214
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,785
What's going on here?

215
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,767
It is!

216
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,435
Look at it!

217
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,135
A sea train!

218
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,337
And it's not the Puffing Tom!

219
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,074
It's another one, and it's
headed this way at full speed!

220
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,041
They're crazy!

221
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:03,610
What're they trying
to do--jump the fence?

222
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:25,766
Hurry!

223
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,399
Close the gate!

224
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,736
We can't let them through!

225
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:29,303
Come on!

226
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,737
Get those doors shut!

227
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,486
Hey, granny!

228
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,187
Yeah? What is it?

229
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,388
There's been a change of plans.

230
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,792
I need you to give me as much
speed as you've got, okay?

231
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,627
Roger!

232
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,761
Roger!

233
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:57,064
It seems we've had to
switch up our plans a little.

234
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,599
Your green-haired
samurai friend says

235
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,101
you all should find
something to hold onto.

236
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,469
Better hurry!

237
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:05,272
Find something to hold onto?

238
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,707
But why?

239
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,342
Hey! Moss-for-brains!

240
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,712
What's going on out here?

241
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:15,049
They, uh, they
closed the Main Gate.

242
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,483
They what?!

243
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,085
This is bad!

244
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,086
We're gonna crash!

245
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,621
What are we gonna do?!
What are we gonna do?!

246
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:21,121
What are we gonna do?!

247
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:24,725
Dodge it, Kokoro!

248
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,560
I've got a plan.

249
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,661
Don't worry.

250
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,596
All right, Zoro!

251
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:36,070
Hey, Frog!

252
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:36,670
See fence?

253
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,404
Smash!

254
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,741
What?!

255
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,542
Gero!

256
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,447
Gero, Gero!

257
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:55,755
Gero, Gero, Gero, Gero!

258
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:06,033
That's his plan?!

259
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:06,734
Does he realize
what's gonna happen

260
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,135
when we run into that fence?!

261
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:21,081
Impossible!

262
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:22,182
That seatrain!

263
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,451
It's flying!!!

264
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,320
No!

265
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:27,688
We're gonna die!

266
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:28,522
What?!

267
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:31,558
But I don't wanna die!

268
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,194
Nami! This way! I'll
save you! Fall into my arms!

269
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,028
Shut up, you idiot!

270
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,397
I've got enough
problems right now!

271
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,970
Zoro!

272
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:43,838
You'd better have
thought long and hard

273
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:48,142
about how you're
gonna land this thing!

274
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,610
Of course I have!

275
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,786
We fall.

276
00:16:58,819 --> 00:16:59,653
Gero!

277
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,590
I hate you!

278
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:05,258
We'll find out if luck's
on our side soon enough.

279
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,630
Oimo's going down!

280
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:29,383
Whoa!

281
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,351
What a crew!

282
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,819
Are you Straw Hats?

283
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:32,820
Damn straight!

284
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:35,222
Is that so?!

285
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,290
That doesn't matter.

286
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,192
Let's move. Time's a' wasting.

287
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,393
We've gotta clear a path.

288
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,261
And fast.

289
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:40,795
All right!

290
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:42,229
You heard him, guys!

291
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,664
We need to go deeper!

292
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:45,165
Let's make a hole!

293
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,534
Yeah!

294
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:02,349
Paulie! No!

295
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,285
Who in the hell are you?

296
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:05,319
Who, us?

297
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:06,420
I'll tell you.

298
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:09,089
The First-Class
Guards of Enies Lobby.

299
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:11,691
The Watchdogs of the Law.

300
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:14,628
By order of Chief
Justice Baskerville.

301
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:18,198
For your crimes,
you're sentenced to death!

302
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:19,800
Damn.

303
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,402
They just keep coming!

304
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,703
One after another.

305
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:23,637
Oimo!

306
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,771
What are you doing?

307
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:27,241
How could you let this pirate
riff-raff open the gate?

308
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,542
What's wrong with you?

309
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:35,115
Can't believe I passed out!

310
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,351
Oh crap!

311
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:42,423
That giant's back up
and on his feet!

312
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,624
Little jerks!

313
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:45,559
You're dead!

314
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:46,793
You'll pay!

315
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:13,220
Whoa!

316
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,154
What the--?!

317
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,624
Rocketman fell from the sky!

318
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,593
We opened those
gates for nothing?!

319
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:29,103
Huh?!

320
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:30,404
What the hell just happened?

321
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,373
Man, that was some landing!

322
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:35,041
Do you think that they're okay?

323
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:42,782
They're not coming out.

324
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,270
Hey! You guys all right?

325
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:07,541
What?!

326
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:08,475
Impossible!

327
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,310
Who are those two?

328
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:21,221
Huh... Maybe we should have
introduced ourselves first.

329
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:22,088
Nah.

330
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:23,791
I'd rather let
my feet do the talking.

331
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:25,659
The Straw Hats are here!

332
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:29,496
We've been waiting for you!

333
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,101
Excellent.

334
00:20:34,134 --> 00:20:35,502
Just like I planned it.

335
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:36,136
Whoa!

336
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:37,337
Really?!

337
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:44,511
Now Gum-Gum Storm!

338
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,514
There he goes!

339
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:48,449
That way!

340
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:49,016
Dammit!

341
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,651
Don't let him escape!

342
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,552
Get back here!

343
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:06,734
You're cornered!

344
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,235
Give it up!

345
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:24,318
Hey!

346
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:24,985
C'mon!

347
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:26,720
There's nowhere left to run!

348
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,473
Move it!

349
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:51,078
Now!

350
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:54,781
Get the hell out of my way!

351
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,730
So, our idiot captain rushed
off by himself again, huh?

352
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:19,400
Well, we're the ones
following that idiot around.

353
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:20,768
So what does that make us?

354
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:21,902
Then again, thanks to Luffy,

355
00:23:21,936 --> 00:23:24,805
the Marine forces are
scattered all over the island!

356
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:25,439
Good!

357
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:26,373
More for me!

358
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,776
I'm not gonna let
Luffy have all the fun.

359
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:30,578
On the next One Piece:

360
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:34,214
"Catch Up with Luffy!
The Straw Hat's All-Out Battle!"

361
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,616
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
