1
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:37,023
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:40,961
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,197
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,369
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,872
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,240
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:56,643
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,645
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,216
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,285
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,755
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,159
What happened to
our 100 million Berries?

13
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,395
Oh, that?
I already spent it all.

14
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:17,364
We needed to buy lots of
meat and booze for the party.

15
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:19,867
Spent it?

16
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,168
[loud banging noises]

17
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,573
Since the ship's
free, we'll be fine!

18
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,475
So no worries, right?

19
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:31,311
Hey, can I have some of
that money to go play with?

20
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,214
I'd sooner
take it to the grave!

21
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,650
Your allowance is revoked!

22
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,353
[LUFFY] A Girl in
Search of her Yagara!

23
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,056
Great Search
in the City of Water.

24
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,697
[YAGARA calling]

25
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,299
What?

26
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:56,336
[ABI]
Bluefin... What is it?

27
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:02,542
A dream?

28
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,148
[LUFFY] Thanks for giving me

29
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,850
this delicious
Water-Water candy!

30
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:10,851
It's awesome!

31
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:11,986
No problem!

32
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,120
I have the money,
why not share it?

33
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,890
With what's left over,
I wanna buy a medical book!

34
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,425
[LUFFY] Sounds good!

35
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,127
Hey, look!

36
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,862
Isn't that Straw Hat Luffy?

37
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:22,729
It sure is!

38
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,131
Hey! Everyone!

39
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,300
The town's hero is here!

40
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,701
[MALE CITIZEN 317A]
Great party!

41
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,103
[FEMALE CITIZEN 317A]
Everyone had a wonderful time!

42
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,270
[MALE CITIZEN 317B]
Thank you!

43
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:30,971
[MALE CITIZEN 317C]
Let's do it again!

44
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,807
Sure! Anytime!

45
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:34,908
"Anytime"?

46
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,710
Did you already
forget Nami's rage?

47
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,384
There, that should do it.

48
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,720
[CITIZEN 317B]
Really, that party was amazing!

49
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,190
[CITIZEN 317C] Yeah, I had a
blast! I'll never forget it!

50
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,927
Hey! Why don't we continue
the party over at my place?

51
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,160
[LUFFY] What? Really?

52
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,228
[CITIZEN 317D]
If that's the case,

53
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:55,996
then we should
do it at my house!

54
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:56,964
[ABI] Wait a sec.

55
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,298
[CITIZEN 317C] No, come to mine!

56
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,001
[ABI] Is that the pirate
Iceberg was talking about?

57
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,603
[CITIZEN 317D]
Who cares whose idea it was?

58
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,305
[ABI] I think it is!
Maybe he could help!

59
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:09,476
Abi! Wait!

60
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,278
You still need
to eat your breakfast!

61
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,215
[ABI'S MOM] Honey,
I know you're worried,

62
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,183
--but you need to stop!
--Abi, what are you--?

63
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,620
Abi...

64
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,427
We'll have it at
your place next time!

65
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,627
Let go!

66
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,528
No!

67
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,297
At my place,
the party'll never stop!

68
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,632
[CITIZEN 317C]
Like I'll let him go with you!

69
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,767
Straw Hat!

70
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,473
[ABI] Please, listen!

71
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,941
I need your help!

72
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,977
My dear, sweet yagara
has gone missing!

73
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,712
You have to help me find him!

74
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,582
You're a hero, right? Please!

75
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:50,784
[CITIZEN 317E] Isn't that Abi?

76
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,686
The girl from the photo studio?

77
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:53,888
Poor thing.

78
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,155
She's still out there
searching for him?

79
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,491
But it's been three days
since Aqua Laguna hit.

80
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,927
If she hasn't found him
by now, he's probably--

81
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,061
Yeah.

82
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,363
[CITIZEN 317F]
An old yagara like him,

83
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,164
surviving on his own
through that giant storm?

84
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,367
Bluefin's not just some
run-of-the-mill yagara,

85
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,068
understand?

86
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,301
He's got a lot of heart!

87
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,638
He'd never lose to
a wave like that, stupid!

88
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,672
What did you say?

89
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,873
Easy, easy.

90
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,508
Think about it, Abi.
You could be right.

91
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,045
He may have somehow been
able to survive the flooding

92
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,412
from Aqua Laguna.

93
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,515
But now, three days
have gone by since the storm.

94
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:22,716
So--

95
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,251
He's right.

96
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:26,353
You shouldn't involve Straw Hat
in a wild goose chase like this.

97
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,355
Besides, being
a citizen of Water 7,

98
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,491
surely you know that
tale of Tsui village.

99
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,860
That's where all the
yagara go when it's time--

100
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,695
Shut up! Shut up!

101
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,096
Listen!

102
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,697
I don't believe in a place
that no one has ever seen!

103
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,166
That's just a fairy tale!

104
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,435
Besides, he appeared
to me in a dream!

105
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,836
He said that he
wanted me to find him,

106
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,238
so I know he's out there
waiting for me!

107
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,706
I'll make a deal with you.

108
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,410
They say that pirates only
live for adventure and treasure.

109
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,577
Isn't that right?

110
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,279
Then here.

111
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:54,481
This is my entire fortune.

112
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:57,451
If you help me find him,
it's yours. All of it!

113
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,853
Whoa.
Your entire fortune, huh?

114
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,523
But only if you
help me find him.

115
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,256
Straw Hat, please.

116
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,059
Don't do it. Listen to me.

117
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,895
If you somehow end up
in the yagara's Tsui village,

118
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:08,629
you might not--

119
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,397
Shut up! Geez!

120
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,565
[CHOPPER] Scary!

121
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,735
I can't really
say I understand,

122
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,703
but you're right.

123
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,204
Once we spot a treasure,

124
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,040
a pirate won't be satisfied
until he's got it in his hand.

125
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,474
That's for sure.

126
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:25,212
[LUFFY] So if
I help you find him...

127
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,916
...you promise you'll give
me that treasure of yours?

128
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,751
That's right.

129
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,185
Sounds good!

130
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,888
Okay. Then it's a deal.

131
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,723
I'm Abi! Pleased to meet you!

132
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,092
Hey! I'm Luffy.

133
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,862
And this is my
crew's doctor, Chopper.

134
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,230
Hi!

135
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:45,365
A raccoon-dog!
And it talks!

136
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,868
Who're you calling
a raccoon dog?

137
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,204
[LUFFY] So what are
we looking for again?

138
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,207
Weren't you paying attention?

139
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,410
My yagara! His name's Bluefin!

140
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,444
Look.

141
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:01,082
[ABI] He has a blue fin
on the top of his head.

142
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:02,950
Bluefin has a blue fin.

143
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,452
Well, that's easy
enough to remember, huh?

144
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,220
Leave it to me!

145
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:11,658
[ABI and CHOPPER screaming]

146
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,560
What the--?

147
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,329
Why'd we start looking
for him way up here?

148
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,034
Because! Take a look!

149
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,704
You can see everything
in the city from this spot!

150
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,439
It's pretty handy, huh?

151
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,807
I'm scared!

152
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,909
Hurry! Get us down! Please!

153
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,677
Wait. Gimme a sec.

154
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,679
[LUFFY]
It's Zoro!

155
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,048
Zoro! Hey!

156
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,582
Up here! Up here!

157
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,884
Can you see me?

158
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,085
[ABI] He can't even
hear you from here!

159
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,088
[CHOPPER] We're gonna fall!

160
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,289
We're what?

161
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:47,694
[ABI and CHOPPER screaming]

162
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,569
That's fun! Ha!

163
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,437
Yeah, maybe for you it was!

164
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,606
Take this seriously!

165
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,145
[NAMI] Robin! What do
you think of this one?

166
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,615
[ROBIN] It's nice! Try it on!

167
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,317
Hey! Nami! Robin!

168
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,318
Over here!

169
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:12,919
Hey!

170
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,188
Hold on.
Maybe Robin can help.

171
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,993
A yagara with a blue fin
on his head, right?

172
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:20,928
I understand.

173
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,530
I'll see what I can do.

174
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,464
Ojos Fleur!

175
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,701
[screaming]

176
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,370

[CITIZENS screaming]

00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,180
So, find him?

179
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,383
I'm afraid not.

180
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,451
I tried. Sorry.

181
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,220
t's okay.
Thanks for looking.

182
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,188
Come on, Abi. Let's go.

183
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,190
[LUFFY] Abi.

184
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,693
[LUFFY] See you later, Robin!

185
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:53,727
[ROBIN] Bye!

186
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,398
[ABI] That was really freaky.

187
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,801
[LUFFY] Well, freaky or not,
thanks to Robin,

188
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,436
at least we know that he
isn't anywhere on the streets.

189
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,505
Aren't you glad
she helped us out?

190
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:08,108
[CHOPPER] Hey Abi,
may I ask you a question?

191
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,376
[ABI] What is it?

192
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,944
[CHOPPER] What's this
"yagara Tsui village"

193
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,079
those guys were talking about?

194
00:10:13,848 --> 00:10:15,348
[ABI] It's an old legend.

195
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:18,152
If a yagara is badly injured,
or suffering from an illness,

196
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,187
or maybe it's just
their time to go,

197
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,523
then supposedly,
they swim off to Tsui Village.

198
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:25,025
It's sort of like
the afterlife for them.

199
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,461
[ABI] But...

200
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:28,762
[CHOPPER] But?

201
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,298
[ABI] It's said that when a
human sees the Tsui village--

202
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,901
What happens?

203
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,869
The yagaras bring
them into that world,

204
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,471
never to return.

205
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:39,940
[CHOPPER screaming]

206
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,341
[ABI] It's just a fairy tale!

207
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,043
There's nothing to be afraid of!

208
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,445
[USOPP]
Hey, Captain.

209
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,814
Don't you think a skilled
sniper might come in handy

210
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,049
the next time you're in a fight?

211
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,583
I mean, you never know!

212
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,552
[USOPP] All right, that's good.

213
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,555
That's one more strategy.

214
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,189
Let's see, what else?

215
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,994
Gotcha!

216
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:02,162
Come on.

217
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,197
Damn it! Oh, no...

218
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,667
[ABI] Bluefin, where are you?

219
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,535
[CHOPPER] He's not here.

220
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:08,502
[LUFFY] You're right.

221
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:10,403
Let's look for him
in the backstreets.

222
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,577
[USOPP] I thought I was a goner!

223
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,281
[CHOPPER] Luffy! Over here!

224
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,918
This yagara said he
heard Bluefin's voice

225
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,685
right when he went missing!

226
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:29,256
On the night of the storm,

227
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,291
you heard a voice saying,
"Don't worry!

228
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:33,060
I'm on my way to help you!

229
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,594
So hang in there!"

230
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:38,498
And he said it was old man
Bluefin's for sure, you guys!

231
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,633
That's good, right?

232
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:40,467
I'll say!

233
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,768
Great! Thank you.

234
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:42,703
You're the best.

235
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:43,904
You're amazing!

236
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,440
You can understand
what yagaras are saying!

237
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,274
Stop it.

238
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,409
It's not a big deal.
You dummy!

239
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,111
Let's try searching
the neighborhood,

240
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,947
now that we have a clue,
we'll find him in no time!

241
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:55,782
[ABI, CHOPPER] Yeah!

242
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,753
[LITTLE GIRL laughing]

243
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:02,155
[LITTLE GIRL 317A]
Faster! Faster!

244
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,124
[DAD 317A] Hey! Calm down!

245
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:12,933
[ABI laughing (flashback)]

246
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,768
[ABI (flashback)]
Stop, that tickles!

247
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:24,744
[ABI laughing]

248
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,119
[ABI]
How is that? Any warmer?

249
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:35,188
Watch out!
You're going the wrong way!

250
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,561
[ABI] Dad, you can't
be serious, right?

251
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,162
Is Bluefin really blind?

252
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,430
[ABI'S DAD] Yeah.

253
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:46,367
A hundred years is
a long life for a yagara.

254
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,802
There's not much
I can do for him anymore.

255
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,204
[ABI] No way.

256
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,806
[ABI'S DAD] Bluefin's
been quite useful to us.

257
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,574
A good yagara.

258
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:58,512
But each day he seems
to get a little bit weaker.

259
00:12:58,546 --> 00:13:02,182
I'm afraid that we should all
start preparing for the worst.

260
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,484
[ABI'S MOM] Poor thing.

261
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:05,552
I know you're right,

262
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,288
but how are we going
to explain it to Abi?

263
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:18,832
[ABI] No! I'm not going!

264
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,234
Not without Bluefin!

265
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,402
[ABI'S DAD] We can't take
refuge anywhere with him.

266
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:24,638
It's the same thing
we do every year.

267
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,873
You understand, right?

268
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,741
No! I won't leave him!

269
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,348
[ABI'S MOM] Our house is
in the middle of town, Abi.

270
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:38,718
We're too far inland for
Aqua Laguna to hurt him.

271
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,454
Oh, Bluefin...

272
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:49,262
We'll be back soon!

273
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:53,768
[ABI] I knew it.

274
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:54,834
Despite what they said,

275
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,536
he got swallowed up
by the storm.

276
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:58,772
[ABI] Or--

277
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,309
I don't know many
fish that drown.

278
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:04,979
We've got a deal, don't we?

279
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,246
I'll help you find him.

280
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,616
Come on now, you can't
give up on him just yet.

281
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:10,751
é/\That's right, Abi.

282
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,686
[LUFFY]
Save the crying for later.

283
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:17,624
I'm not crying! Let's go!

284
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,394
[LUFFY] Okay, then.

285
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,461
Right!

286
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,030
Let's go back to where
we started searching.

287
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,432
Maybe we missed something.
You never know!

288
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,739
What's this thing?

289
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:34,475
Wait!

290
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,076
This is Bluefin's!

291
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,747
It came from there.

292
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,551
[ABI] That's the entrance to
the underground water passage!

293
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,022
Here's more!

294
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,079
--[LUFFY] Hey! Bluefin!
--[ABI] Bluefin! Are you here?

295
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:15,983
--[CHOPPER] Bluefin! Hey!
--[ABI] Hey! Bluefin!

296
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:17,251
[ABI and CHOPPER]
Bluefin!

297
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,786
[LUFFY]
Where are you?

298
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:20,153
[CHOPPER]
Hey!

299
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,490
[ALL screaming]

300
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:28,028
[LUFFY panicking]

301
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:30,630
Get me out of the water!
Hurry! Somebody, help me!

302
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:31,665
[ABI] What's wrong?

303
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,568
It's shallow.

304
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,239
[LUFFY] We can't go any
further on a yagara, huh?

305
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,776
[ABI] It looks like there's
hardly any water at all

306
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,044
from here.

307
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,347
Either way,
let's keep going.

308
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,380
Yeah.

309
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,718
You wait here.
We'll be back soon.

310
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,152
See ya.

311
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,322
[YAGARA calling]

312
00:15:58,626 --> 00:15:59,659
[LUFFY] What's this?

313
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,662
You mean there's a
town underneath the town?

314
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,096
That's kind of weird.

315
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,631
[ABI] Yeah.

316
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,166
The new buildings are
built over the old ones.

317
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,134
It's because of
the rising sea level.

318
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,337
At least, that's
what my dad told me.

319
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,311
What's that? Over there.

320
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,253
[LUFFY] Abi! Wait!

321
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,789
[ABI]
That's gotta be where he is!

322
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,727
[ABI] Soon we'll
be together again!

323
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:37,430
[ABI] I'm coming, Bluefin!

324
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:43,236
[ABI] What's this?

325
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:03,657
[ABI] I can't breathe!

326
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,660
[ABI] It hurts!

327
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,430
Help me! Bluefin!

328
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,580
I'm alive.

329
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,717
[ABI] Luffy! Chopper!

330
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,685
Are you all right?

331
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,620
[LUFFY coughing]

332
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,725
Thank goodness!

333
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,396
Where the heck...?

334
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:03,984
Hey. What's wrong, Abi?

335
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:07,955
[ABI] Luffy. Bluefin is here.

336
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,991
This is the same place
I saw in my dream!

337
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,994
Are you saying
we found Tsui village?

338
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,630
Of course not!
That's ridiculous!

339
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,132
That village doesn't exist!

340
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:19,800
There's no way
that Bluefin is dead!

341
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,167
You hear me?

342
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,337
The Tsui village is nothing
but a yagara fairy tale!

343
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,420
I knew it!
See, he's fine!

344
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:40,187
Come on, Bluefin!

345
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,623
Let's go home together, okay?

346
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:45,692
[BLUEFIN calling]

347
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,095
What did he say?

348
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,931
I'm sorry, Abi, but--

349
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,333
Why're you apologizing?

350
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:55,335
Listen! I've been
looking for you everywhere!

351
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,306
[ABI] Don't worry
about losing your scarf.

352
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,608
I can always
make you another one.

353
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,177
C'mon! Let's go back home!

354
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,412
[BLUEFIN calling]

355
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,080
Well, Chopper?

356
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:11,252
He said, "No. Sorry.
I can't do that."

357
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:12,552
Why not?

358
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:18,492
[CHOPPER] "With this,
I am now at peace."

359
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:22,596
[BLUEFIN calling]

360
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:27,467
"Thanks for everything, Abi."

361
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:31,037
No! Don't go!

362
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,257
Bluefin! No!
Please! Don't leave me!

363
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,526
I've been searching
for you everywhere!

364
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,760
I love you!

365
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:57,530
Wherever it is you're going,
please, take me with you!

366
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,540
Let go of me!

367
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,026
[BLUEFIN calling]

368
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:30,096
Bluefin!

369
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:42,609
[YAGARAS calling]

370
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:54,254
[YAGARA crying]

371
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,358
What's that?

372
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:58,859
It's crying.

373
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:08,869
[YAGARA crying]

374
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:13,874
[YAGARA crying]

375
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:15,308
His breathing's
a little weak,

376
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:17,178
but I think he's
gonna be all right!

377
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:18,379
Bluefin must have found him

378
00:21:18,412 --> 00:21:20,181
and given him his scarf
to keep him warm.

379
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:21,882
It probably saved his life.

380
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:23,451
You're right.

381
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:26,253
That really is the scarf
I gave to Bluefin.

382
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:29,757
[CHOPPER] "Don't worry!
I'm on my way to help you!

383
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,425
So hang in there!"

384
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,661
He came down here
to save this baby.

385
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,670
That's why he
was in my dream.

386
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,359
[ABI] Here.

387
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:08,195
Keep it.

388
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:10,564
I didn't hold up
my end of the bargain.

389
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:12,933
Really, it's fine.

390
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:14,935
Thanks for everything, Luffy.

391
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:16,137
Because of you,

392
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,272
I was able to see
Bluefin one last time.

393
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:20,774
I'll always be
grateful for that.

394
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,176
And besides...

395
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:25,613
We were also able to
fulfill Bluefin's last wish

396
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:28,081
by saving this little baby.

397
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:31,651
I'm glad.

398
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:35,455
[LUFFY] Thanks!

399
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:42,963
Use that to feed the kid,

400
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:45,498
and make sure he
stays healthy and happy.

401
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:52,272
Thank you.

402
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,675
[CHOPPER] Hey, Luffy.

403
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,178
Do you really think that
place was the Tsui village?

404
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,913
[LUFFY] Who knows? It could be!

405
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,950
There are a lot of things we
don't know about in this world.

406
00:23:02,983 --> 00:23:04,751
It was a nice place, though.

407
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,128
[AUNTIE] Listen up, everyone!

408
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:15,629
We've got a substitute!

409
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:18,299
[ZORO] Listen, I don't have
anything to do with this house.

410
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:19,066
Got it?

411
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:20,333
Why would I--

412
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:21,868
[AUNTIE] Here.
Take care of these kids for me.

413
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,637
[ZORO] Should I give
these two a--Wait!

414
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,771
What am I saying?
No way!

415
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:27,240
Have you heard
anything I've said?

416
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:28,842
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

417
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:30,177
Mothers Are Strong!

418
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,479
Zoro's Hectic Household Chores.

419
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:35,348
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
