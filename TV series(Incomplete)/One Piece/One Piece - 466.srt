00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,024
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,627
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,130
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,800
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,336
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,305
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,441
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:57,144
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,879
they capture the
unwanted attention of

10
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,313
the World Government,

11
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:04,518
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,954
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:10,390
I can't wait to see what kind
of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,493
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:18,398
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,305
[NARRATOR] Separated from the
rest of the Straw Hat crew,

17
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,173
Luffy is headed to
Navy headquarters

18
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,610
to rescue his brother
Ace from execution.

19
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,545
Meanwhile, the
Whitebeard Pirates

20
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,348
have successfully stormed
Marineford to save Ace,

21
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,617
and triggered an all-out
war with the Navy.

22
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:41,488
[OARS JR. panting]
I'm here.

23
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,557
[ACE]
Oars! No!

24
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:52,632
Now. Climb up Oars'
body and charge!

[IVANKOV]
Hee-haw!

30
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:10,517
[LUFFY]
I'm here Ace!

31
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,955
[ALL yell]

32
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,399
[LUFFY yelling]

33
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,135
[IVANKOV] I think my poor heart
is about to go "kablooie!"

34
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,538
Hey, can't you slow
us down somehow?

35
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,139
There's gotta be something!

36
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,374
What good are waxworks
at a time like this?

37
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:35,442
[ALL yell]

38
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,379
[NARRATOR] Why are Luffy and
the others falling from the sky?

39
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,115
Good question.

40
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:45,386
To figure out what happened,
we'll have to go back in time.

41
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,121
The Marine ship that
Luffy and company were on

42
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:51,392
was hit hard by Whitebeard's
destructive seaquake.

43
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,861
[PRISONER CC] It feels like
it's starting to pick up speed!

44
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,697
Huh... Uh. Hey!

45
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:58,799
Behind us!

46
00:04:58,833 --> 00:04:59,633
[PRISONERS]
Huh?

47
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:00,567
Ah!

48
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,401
[LUFFY gasps]

49
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:06,940
[BUGGY]
Huh? Ah... Oh, hell no.

50
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:10,143
[PRISONER AA]
It's a tsunami!

51
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,145
It's huge!

52
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,346
And it's headed our way!

53
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,351
[JIMBEI]
This is no natural occurrence.

54
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,454
Only one man commands
such fearsome power.

55
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,356
Hey! Jimbei! Wake up!

56
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,957
We gotta do something!

57
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,027
Stupid tsunami.

58
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,497
No way in hell I'm gonna let
myself lose to that dumb thing!

59
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,199
I gotta get to Ace and save him!

60
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,536
Bring in the sails!

61
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:36,937
Hold on, Luffy.

62
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,338
We're going to ride
this tsunami!

63
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,372
[BUGGY yelps]

64
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,141
[PRISONERS]
Is that a good idea?!

65
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,310
That moron's gonna
get us all killed!

66
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,812
I'm not ready to die yet!
Turn around, you fool!

67
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,513
Gimme the wheel!

68
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,614
[JIMBEI]
Hey! Stop it!

69
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,549
[PRISONER BB]
The tsunami's getting closer!

70
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:50,884
[PRISONER CC]
Jump into the sea!

71
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,452
[PRISONER DD]
What?! How would that help?

72
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,222
And you call yourself pirates.

73
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,292
It's common sense, amateurs.

74
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,628
[CROCODILE]
If we turn around now,

75
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:05,399
the wave will strike the side
of the ship and we'll capsize.

76
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,668
Riding it is our only option.

77
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,169
So there you have it!

78
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,338
Unless you all want to
end up washed away,

79
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,307
everyone better hold on tight!

80
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,374
Gotcha!

81
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,376
Hurry up!

82
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,311
Just grab something! Anything!

83
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,345

What the heck?

92
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,003
[PRISONER EE]
The wave stopped moving!

93
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,339
[PRISONER FF] How in the
world did that happen?

94
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:21,742
That is messed up!

95
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:24,945
I mean, at least we're not dead,
but what are we supposed to do,

96
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,013
take an icepick to this thing?

97
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:30,350
[JIMBEI] I think I know
who did this, as well.

98
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,955
Just take a look below.

99
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:37,324
The answer's clear enough.

100
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:38,492
[IVANKOV]
Ah...

101
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,527
It's the old man.

102
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,395
The battle's already
started without us.

103
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,197
[JIMBEI]
It's just as I thought.

104
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:47,701
He set off that seaquake
as a declaration of war.

105
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:51,438
And Admiral Aokiji froze
the tsunami in response.

106
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,140
[LUFFY]
Hey guys, listen up!

107
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,542
I got an idea that'll
get us down there!

108
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,811
We got less than three
hours to work with,

109
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:01,448
so this is our best chance to
save Ace from getting executed!

110
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,016
[BUGGY]
Uh-huh, go on.

111
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,319
Are you mad?! You want to
slide all the way down

112
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,555
this frozen wave
back into the sea?!

113
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:09,723
[LUFFY]
That's it!

114
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,458
But first we gotta
wiggle the ship free

115
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,394
so we can actually
start sliding!

116
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,329
Need I remind you,
this is a battleship?

117
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,164
It's not going to
"wiggle" easily!

118
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,399
Didja hear that, you idiot?

119
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,335
[LUFFY]
If we work together,

120
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:22,869
I know we can do it!

121
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,339
Huh. When you put it that
way, it sounds pretty cool.

[PRISONER H]
All right!

If Captain Buggy, the next
King of the Pirates,

125
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,778
thinks we can do it, then
anything's possible!

His fighting spirit
is rubbing off on us!

127

The new target is T-O-T-T-Z.

134
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,560
and make the shift
to operation three.

135
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,529
Sounds like the Navy is
busy giving out orders.

136

Advance all preparations now!

137
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:53,367
T-O-T. What d'you
think that means?

Dunno.

00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:55,802
Maybe some sorta secret
code they're using.

Once all soldiers
are in place,

we will move the
schedule forward

out a chunk of ice!

Grab hold!

178
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,107
Start climbing!

179
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,541
Ha! This ain't got nothin'

180
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,511
on the water torture we went
through in Impel Down!

[JIMBEI]
What use are Devil Fruit powers

182
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,624

[LUFFY]
Oh, yeah.

187
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:20,347
We were stuck on that wave.

188
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:27,555
[gasps] Save Ace!

Damn it.

192
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,343
Where is he?!

193
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,545
Ace! [coughs]

[MARINE AA]
Get on the ship!

196
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:08,361
Guess he's not over here!

197
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,339
Man, where is he?

198
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,778
Hold on, Ace!

I'm here!

I'm coming. Hang on!

[MARINE D]
Hey, is that who I think it is?

220
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,310
It's Crocodile!

221
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,945
And he's not the
only one, either!

222
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,047
Just take a look at that lineup!

All the big names are here!

can't handle this madness!

get you outta here!

Hey, Garp!

Your family's messing
things up again!

Luffy, no!

233
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:38,038
Look! Straw Hat's
got some company!

234
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,139
It's Jimbei!

235
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,308

Army's Ivankov!

[MARINE F]
There's a ton

238
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,478
of infamous pirates
behind them, too!

239
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:48,582
They must've all escaped
from Impel Down somehow!

240
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,285
Straw Hat's causing
trouble again, is he?

241
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:52,553
I'm not surprised.

242
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:56,457
Is... that... Straw... Hat?!

243
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,926
What is Straw Hat Luffy
doing here, too?

244
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,562
Looks like he forgot to bring
his crew along with him.

245
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:02,763
[gasps] Luffy!

246
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,299
I'm so relieved to see
that you're alive!

I can't believe it, Helmeppo!

[HELMEPPO]
What is it?

249
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,470
Not another surprise, I hope.

250

Straw Hat!

251
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,873
That's crazy!

252
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:14,942
That means he must've
escaped from Impel Down!

253
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,144
How much tougher
can this guy get?!

254
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:20,480
Now those are some big
fish we're starin' at.

255
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:23,951
Well, fancy seeing him!

256
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,453
That boy sure gets around, huh?

257
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,055
Guess that's the
famous kid brother

258
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,656
Ace was always tellin' us about.

259
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,760
A former and active
Warlord, hand-in-hand!

260
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:34,929
[laughs] And look!

261
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:37,965
We even have the famous rookie
Straw Hat in attendance!

262
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,500
This is too good!

263
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,602
Smoker, look there! Quickly!

00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:42,269

Huh?

Straw Hat Luffy and Crocodile.

268

What are those two
doing together?

269
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,580
[AKAINU]
So it is him.

270
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:56,550
The grandson of our very
own Marine hero Garp,

271
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:00,554
and the son of the
revolutionary, Dragon.

272
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,457
I'll make that boy
regret the day

273
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,959
he decided to become a pirate!

[SENGOKU growls]
Of all things.

275
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,436
You have the gall to ally
yourself with Straw Hat Luffy.

276
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:18,071
After all we've done for you,
you repay us like this?!

277
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,306
That's right!

278
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,475
I choose to resign from
the Seven Warlords!

[SENGOKU growls]

280
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,476
Rather peculiar.

281
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,079
All these groups
uniting against us.

282
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,714
[BUGGY]
Time to kick Marine ass!

283
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:30,751
[GARP] Prisoners, a commander
of the Revolutionary army,

284
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:33,487
those gaudy-looking fellows,

285
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,289
and Crocodile.

286
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:40,260
I highly doubt everyone here has
a common goal in this battle.

287
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,997
They're all too different
for that to make any sense.

Huh? Where'd Croco-Boy go?

291
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:25,238
[BUGGY] Huh? I guess
the sucker chickened out

292
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,308
and left us high and dry.

293
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,543
Wait, there he is!

294
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:36,617
Dammit! You're supposed
to wait for me!

295
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,318
It's Crocodile, he's going
straight for Whitebeard!

296
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:39,553
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE D]
Pops!

297
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,088
[CROCODILE]
Long time no see.

298
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,489
Old man.

299
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,725
[WHITEBEARD]
You never learn.

00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,959
[CROCODILE chuckles]

301
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:47,527

Huh?

[CROCODILE grunts]

304
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:09,750
[CROCODILE]
Straw Hat knows too well

305
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:12,486
what my strengths
and weaknesses are.

306
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,657
Once you touch water, then you
can't turn into sand anymore.

307
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,732
You know there's only
one reason I'm here.

308
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:28,468
If you wanna save your brother
so bad, stay out of my way.

309
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,804
I'm killing Whitebeard
and you can't stop me!

310
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,439
So that old guy is Whitebeard.

311
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:33,607
I thought so.

312
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,442
Just stay away from him!

313
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:38,446
He's Ace's friend, so I'm
not gonna let him get hurt!

314
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:39,647
Well would you look at that.

315
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,082
It runs in the family.

316
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:43,584
[CROCODILE]
Huh?

317
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,286
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE BB]
Don't let him get close to Pops!

318
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,287
[WHITEBEARD]
Mm...

319
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,302
[WHITEBEARD] When you came
back from the East Blue

320
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:05,706
missing an arm, you better
believe the rumors were flying.

321
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:08,475
I was pretty curious myself.

322
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,544
Now I can ask you face to face.

323
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:14,514
What enemy did you give
that left arm to?

324
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:21,488
Don't worry, I gave it to a kid.

325
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,622
Hey, squirt.

326
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,558
That straw hat that
you're wearing,

327
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:27,728
it looks exactly like
the one Red-Haired Shanks

328
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:28,929
used to have on him.

329
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:31,965
Hold on, how do you and
Shanks know each other?

330
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:35,469
You're right, it was his
hat. He left it to me.

331
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,070
[ACE]
Can you believe it, Pops?

332
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:40,307
Look, this dork is
my kid brother!

333
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:46,080
You came here to rescue
your big brother?

334
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:47,547
[LUFFY]
That's right.

335
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:51,484
Do you have the slightest idea
who our forces are up against?

336
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:59,960
A squirt like you is gonna
get slaughtered real easy!

Shut up!

You don't even know me!

342
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,557
[LUFFY]
I know what you're up to!

343
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,558
Yeah.

344
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:33,193
You wanna be the King, huh?

345
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,698
First, you gotta go through me!

346
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:40,534
Got it?

What a cheeky little punk!

Don't come crying to me for help

if you get a few boo
boos, spoiled brat!

Yeah right!

354
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:28,982
I'm not all old like you!

355
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,953
I'm gonna be the
one to rescue Ace!

356
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:34,621
He's competing...?

357
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:35,822
With Whitebeard!

358
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,291
We're done for!

359
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:46,566
[KIZARU]
How cute.

360
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,570
I would assume this is
all punishable by death.

361
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:51,539
Right, Sengoku?

362
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:53,541
Definitely.

363
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:55,041
Luffy.

364
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:56,544
My family.

365
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:59,546
You just sit tight, Ace!

366
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,648
I'm comin' for ya.

367
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:05,352
You're not gonna die today!

368
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,496
[NARRATOR]
Luffy leaps into the fray.

369
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:18,499
Battling against familiar
faces and new foes alike,

370
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:22,302
he races toward the scaffold
like a whirlwind of destruction.

371
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:24,471
And as his brother begs
for him to turn back,

372
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:27,707
Luffy shares some powerful
words of his own.

373
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,443
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

374
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:32,713
"Even if it Means Death!
Luffy vs. the Navy;

375
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:33,914
The Battle Starts!"

376
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:36,483
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
