WEBVTT

00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:37.381
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:40.087
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.430
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.463 --> 00:02:47.836
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:51.242
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:53.146
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.652
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:58.423
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.492 --> 00:03:02.565
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.598 --> 00:03:04.268
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.302 --> 00:03:08.409
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.443 --> 00:03:12.785
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:17.862
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors,

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:19.966
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.108
intending to destroy a Devil
Fruit Factory in Dressrosa.

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:27.348
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:30.020
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:32.357
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:34.663
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:34.697 --> 00:03:36.834
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:39.739
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:41.743 --> 00:03:45.718
I miss Greenbit.
Could you please let me go?

00:03:45.751 --> 00:03:48.323
Hush, girl. I suppose
I have no choice

00:03:48.356 --> 00:03:50.728
but to wring the powers
out of you then!

00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:52.131
[MANSHERRY cries]

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:55.170
[MANSHERRY]
Help me! Leo!

00:03:55.203 --> 00:03:57.274
Now, wake up, everyone!

00:03:57.307 --> 00:04:00.280
Time for the Don Quixote
Family reunion.

00:04:00.313 --> 00:04:02.652
Then let me help you with that!

00:04:05.024 --> 00:04:06.727
I strung you all together,

00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:10.100
so your friends won't get
separated anymore!

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:15.144
Haute Couture! Patch Work, go!

00:04:15.177 --> 00:04:16.947
Oh no!

00:04:21.923 --> 00:04:27.034
If you keep fighting me like
this, you really are gonna die!

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:32.478
[chuckles] Even if I die,
I can take you down with me.

00:04:32.512 --> 00:04:33.413
[groans]

00:04:33.446 --> 00:04:35.685
If nothing else,
maybe Doflamingo will

00:04:35.718 --> 00:04:38.891
think on me fondly
when I'm gone.

00:04:40.694 --> 00:04:42.598
[BELLAMY grunts]

00:04:56.392 --> 00:05:00.433
[LUFFY] "The Manly Duel! Señor's
Elegy of Love!"

00:05:08.717 --> 00:05:12.758
Stop it! That jerk isn't worth
trading your life for!

00:05:16.198 --> 00:05:17.935
I made my choice.

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:19.873
Stop with that crap!

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:31.095
[BELLAMY grunts]

00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:40.514
[LEO] We should head back
to Viola and the others.

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:43.386
We're only wasting our
time here, so let's go.

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.190
[CUB]
We're coming.

00:05:45.224 --> 00:05:48.697
[MANSHERRY]
Leo! Leo!

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.639
My leg was hurt bad.

00:05:52.672 --> 00:05:55.711
Can you carry me on your back?

00:05:57.414 --> 00:05:59.820
Or maybe in your arms?

00:05:59.853 --> 00:06:03.126
There you go again,
acting like a big baby.

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:04.930
You can fix your own injuries,

00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:07.635
you have healing powers,
you lazy dummy!

00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:10.473
Besides, I know you've
always been a good runner.

00:06:10.508 --> 00:06:14.014
Stop playing games,
we've gotta hurry.

00:06:14.048 --> 00:06:18.156
Meanie! I'm staying then!

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.462
What? For real?
You're so selfish!

00:06:21.496 --> 00:06:24.435
I never asked for you to
come here and save me, Leo!

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.339
[LEO groans]
I put my life on the line!

00:06:26.372 --> 00:06:27.709
You are so ungrateful!

00:06:27.742 --> 00:06:31.583
Do you really want me
to leave you here?

00:06:31.617 --> 00:06:32.752
Go!

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.465
Just carry her out
for now. We gotta go.

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:40.467
[LEO]
That hurt.

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:41.836
[MANSHERRY]
Hmph.

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:47.114
You're obnoxious!
Selfish, fickle, despicable,

00:06:47.147 --> 00:06:48.350
and mean spirited!

00:06:48.383 --> 00:06:51.556
Such a huge, huge
pain in the patootie!

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:54.462
[MANSHERRY]
His back feels nice.

00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:58.069
[CUB] Our princess
is just the sweetest!

00:06:59.573 --> 00:07:03.146
[CUB]
How thickheaded can Leo be?

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.050
[gasps] Big problem!

00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:07.087
They took Mansherry and ran off!

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.291
Go after the Little People!

00:07:09.324 --> 00:07:12.230
They went that way! Seize them!

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.169
[GIOLLA]
How embarrassing.

00:07:15.203 --> 00:07:20.213
I hate to admit defeat, but the
situation has become dire.

00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:24.823
[GIOLLA]
He won't be thrilled,

00:07:24.857 --> 00:07:27.595
but I must report
to the Young Master.

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:30.333
I recall him saying that
Mansherry's Devil Fruit

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:33.306
must have a hidden
"ultimate ability."

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:34.809
He believed that
he could use that

00:07:34.843 --> 00:07:37.313
if something happened
to the SMILE Factory.

00:07:37.347 --> 00:07:40.655
If she traded her life to
call forth that forbidden power,

00:07:40.688 --> 00:07:42.858
she could restore it
to its former glory.

00:07:42.892 --> 00:07:46.131
Without that failsafe,
we could be in trouble.

00:07:51.877 --> 00:07:55.217
[GIOLLA]
I-If nothing is done, then...

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.320
The factory is in peril!

00:07:57.354 --> 00:07:59.191
It's on you, Señor!

00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:01.328
You're our last line of defense!

00:08:01.362 --> 00:08:03.501
[FRANKY]
Franky...

00:08:03.534 --> 00:08:07.474
[WOMEN]
No! Señor, please be careful!

00:08:07.508 --> 00:08:12.651
[FRANKY]
...Strong Hammer!

00:08:16.927 --> 00:08:19.298
[INHEL gasps] Oh! He dove
in the ground again!

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:22.939
Fraland, look!
It's the attack dive!

00:08:22.973 --> 00:08:25.644
[DWARVES]
Dodge!

00:08:27.982 --> 00:08:31.055
Meow-Meow Suplex!

00:08:42.512 --> 00:08:44.615
[WOMAN 664A]
Oh! Señor!

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:51.930
[panting]

00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:58.611
Señor must be at his limit.

00:08:58.644 --> 00:09:01.115
Yeah, neither one
can keep this up.

00:09:01.148 --> 00:09:03.353
Fraland!

00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:04.555
Something's wrong!

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:06.425
You could have
easily dodged that!

00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:07.662
What's with you?

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:09.364
[INHEL] Why'd we see you
take that same move

00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:11.335
over and over again?

00:09:12.538 --> 00:09:14.475
Stay outta this, Tontattas.

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:15.443
[DWARVES gasp]

00:09:15.476 --> 00:09:17.214
Ya' know, Señor's also been hit

00:09:17.247 --> 00:09:20.220
with the same punch
30 times in a row, too.

00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:21.756
Why would he do that?

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.896
When someone offers to
buy a round at the bar,

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.334
if you're a real man,
then you wouldn't dare

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:29.806
take your glass offa the table.

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:32.310
[INHEL]
You're getting hit on purpose?

00:09:32.344 --> 00:09:34.549
[FRANKY]
This guy's a bro among bros.

00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:37.622
So I'm gonna take every
attack he throws at me.

00:09:37.655 --> 00:09:39.559
Out of respect.

00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:42.497
He can throw whatever
he's got at me.

00:09:42.531 --> 00:09:44.435
I'll still win.

00:09:44.468 --> 00:09:46.405
'Cause that's what I'm about!

00:09:46.439 --> 00:09:50.279
We're doin' it
Strong Style, baby!

00:09:51.148 --> 00:09:52.918
[FRANKY]
It's cute you're concerned,

00:09:52.952 --> 00:09:54.556
but this is a man's fight!

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:57.361
So just stand back
and watch me win!

00:09:57.394 --> 00:09:58.997
Don't fret, little friends.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.036
I won't let you
lose your freedom.

00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:09.218
[DWARVES]
Yeah! Kick his butt, Fraland!

00:10:09.251 --> 00:10:12.792
[SEÑOR chuckles]
Your words make me tipsier

00:10:12.825 --> 00:10:15.964
than any dive bar
I've ever been to, kid.

00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:20.406
[SEÑOR] I'd like to see you
back up that fancy talk.

00:10:27.353 --> 00:10:28.657
[FRANKY gasps]

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:41.650
[SEÑOR]
I'll confess.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.121
This body's not as spry
as it used to be,

00:10:44.154 --> 00:10:46.759
so my next move is
going to settle this.

00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:49.999
How are you two going to fight
when you're so far apart?

00:10:50.032 --> 00:10:52.571
Señor! Closer!

00:10:52.605 --> 00:10:55.545
[SEÑOR] Hey, pervert,
are you're picking up

00:10:55.578 --> 00:10:57.915
what I'm throwing down?

00:10:57.948 --> 00:11:02.123
You said you'd take whatever
I can hurl at you, right?

00:11:02.157 --> 00:11:04.930
True men don't go
back on their word.

00:11:04.963 --> 00:11:09.906
So, let's see you
try surviving this one!

00:11:15.483 --> 00:11:16.719
They're outside!

00:11:16.753 --> 00:11:19.625
I must watch this
manly battle 'til the end!

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:22.096
[WOMEN]
Señor, go!

00:11:23.534 --> 00:11:26.606
If you can withstand
this final blow,

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.342
I'll take the loss.

00:11:29.612 --> 00:11:34.221
[SEÑOR] I'll accept whatever
attack you wish to dish out.

00:11:34.254 --> 00:11:36.759
Bring it on!

00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:44.709
[INHEL gasps] He swam straight
up the side of the tower!

00:11:44.742 --> 00:11:47.982
What in the heck is
that guy gonna do up there?

00:11:51.355 --> 00:11:55.764
[SEÑOR] That's a mean looking
sky today, don't ya think?

00:11:57.067 --> 00:12:01.208
[SEÑOR] But if I can
keep flyin', then maybe...

00:12:02.712 --> 00:12:05.985
...I can see my Russian.

00:12:06.018 --> 00:12:07.220
Russian?

00:12:07.253 --> 00:12:10.761
[SEÑOR] Yeah. I'd like to
see my son, Gimlet, too.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:16.239
[SEÑOR] Unfortunately, gravity's
gonna fight me on this,

00:12:16.272 --> 00:12:18.109
and I can't keep flying.

00:12:18.142 --> 00:12:20.446
[FRANKY] Hey! What are
you rambling about?

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.522
Tell me, Cyborg, your back's
still flesh n' blood, right?

00:12:24.555 --> 00:12:27.360
Dammit. You figured that out?

00:12:27.393 --> 00:12:30.400
[SEÑOR] Now, shuddup before
you bite your own tongue off.

00:12:30.433 --> 00:12:34.008
[FRANKY yelling]

00:12:34.041 --> 00:12:37.848
Fraland's real tough!
But can he survive that fall?

00:12:37.881 --> 00:12:41.556
Fraland, oh no!

00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:45.196
Meow-Meow Suplex!

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:51.609
[SEÑOR]
Baby...

00:12:51.643 --> 00:12:53.880
...Buster!

00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:57.542
[INHEL]
Fraland!

00:13:57.575 --> 00:14:00.446
[WOMEN]
Yay! Go, Señor!

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.019
[WOMEN gasp]

00:14:23.793 --> 00:14:26.265
[FRANKY]
Remember your words, old man.

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:29.370
Now you'll get to see
what I'm made of.

00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:36.452
Huh. You got me there.

00:14:36.485 --> 00:14:40.059
[FRANKY grunts]

00:14:40.093 --> 00:14:41.830
[SEÑOR]
I'm sorry, Young Master.

00:14:41.863 --> 00:14:47.942
All right. Franky Iron Boxing!

00:14:47.975 --> 00:14:50.080
[SEÑOR]
He shows no mercy.

00:14:50.113 --> 00:14:53.453
Like icy rain, the punches
pour down on me.

00:14:53.486 --> 00:14:56.391
Ahh yes, I remember now.

00:14:56.425 --> 00:15:03.305
Russian. The day I first met you
and the day you stopped smiling.

00:15:09.251 --> 00:15:12.692
[SEÑOR] That cold,
dark rain kept pouring,

00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:14.695
just like in my heart.

00:15:38.743 --> 00:15:41.248
Ah! It's a wet one
out there, huh?

00:15:41.281 --> 00:15:43.553
Whew, I'm drenched. [laughs]

00:15:43.587 --> 00:15:48.095
What's so amusing?
Aren't you freezing cold?

00:15:48.129 --> 00:15:52.370
It's fine. I love rain.
Feels nice.

00:15:55.109 --> 00:15:56.478
[RUSSIAN]
Don't you love it, too?

00:15:56.513 --> 00:15:57.748
Huh?

00:15:57.782 --> 00:15:59.250
The rain.

00:16:09.939 --> 00:16:13.045
[RUSSIAN]
What things don't I like? Hmm...

00:16:13.078 --> 00:16:16.553
Oh. Pirates! Hate 'em to death.

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:20.192
So, what do you do? Huh?

00:16:21.596 --> 00:16:24.134
Me? I'm, uh, a banker.

00:16:24.167 --> 00:16:26.004
[RUSSIAN]
Ohh.

00:16:51.823 --> 00:16:54.294
[RUSSIAN]
You're home? Welcome back!

00:16:54.327 --> 00:16:56.566
Aww. Picked up some more stuff?

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.537
Well, lemme see!

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.074
Oh, it's so cute!

00:17:01.843 --> 00:17:04.248
Thanks, honey.
You're the greatest.

00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:05.918
What else did you grab?

00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:09.457
Wow! This is adorable,
too! [giggles]

00:17:09.491 --> 00:17:11.461
[gunshots]

00:17:20.948 --> 00:17:22.316
[SEÑOR]
Move it!

00:17:24.087 --> 00:17:28.362
[baby crying]

00:17:28.395 --> 00:17:30.399
[RUSSIAN]
There you are!

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.878
[RUSSIAN] So, Honey.
What should we name him?

00:17:35.911 --> 00:17:39.719
He looks like a Gimlet.

00:17:39.752 --> 00:17:42.123
I think that suits him fine.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.073
[GIMLET crying]

00:18:07.106 --> 00:18:08.576
Honey?

00:18:12.284 --> 00:18:14.288
Where did daddy go?

00:18:14.321 --> 00:18:17.193
Oh? What's wrong? Good boy.

00:18:17.227 --> 00:18:19.531
It's okay. There's--

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:22.470
There's no need to cry.

00:18:22.504 --> 00:18:27.213
[GIMLET crying]

00:18:40.908 --> 00:18:45.517
[gasps] Gimlet is dead?

00:18:45.551 --> 00:18:47.453
[RUSSIAN]
A week ago, today.

00:18:47.486 --> 00:18:51.061
The same day you disappeared.

00:18:51.094 --> 00:18:53.332
He came down with
a sudden fever.

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:56.739
I rushed him to the hospital,
but he didn't make it.

00:18:58.743 --> 00:18:59.679
[RUSSIAN]
You lied.

00:18:59.712 --> 00:19:00.981
[SEÑOR gasps]

00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:04.689
You lied! I called
the bank over and over.

00:19:04.722 --> 00:19:08.195
But they told me you were
never employed there!

00:19:08.228 --> 00:19:10.366
Tell me the truth!

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:13.740
What do you really do
for a living?

00:19:13.774 --> 00:19:17.180
Where did the money
come from? Say it!

00:19:17.213 --> 00:19:19.819
Hey! Why won't you tell me?

00:19:19.852 --> 00:19:24.796
You don't have the right
to be a father anymore! Move!

00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:27.166
W-Wait!

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:28.871
Wait! Russian!

00:19:28.904 --> 00:19:30.774
It's terrible out here.

00:19:30.808 --> 00:19:35.750
You stop following me!
I need to be alone now!

00:19:38.155 --> 00:19:40.560
[SEÑOR]
You don't understand, Russian.

00:19:40.593 --> 00:19:43.767
There's a reason
I can't tell you the truth.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.973
Pirates! Hate 'em to death.

00:19:47.006 --> 00:19:51.615
[SEÑOR]
Russian! Where are you? Russian!

00:20:03.707 --> 00:20:04.842
[SEÑOR]
Russian...

00:20:04.875 --> 00:20:07.346
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL 715A ringing]

00:20:09.484 --> 00:20:11.321
[DOCTOR 715A]
I'm sorry to report

00:20:11.355 --> 00:20:13.627
your wife is in
critical condition.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.599
She was trapped under
a landslide during the storm.

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:20.072
She's awake but unresponsive.

00:20:20.106 --> 00:20:21.909
A vegetative state?

00:20:21.943 --> 00:20:24.181
[DOCTOR 715A]
Exactly, the trauma has left her

00:20:24.214 --> 00:20:26.285
with no signs of awareness.

00:20:26.318 --> 00:20:28.556
And I'm afraid she
may never recover.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:33.132
Sad to say, the woman you
once knew is no longer there.

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:34.233
I am not entirely sure

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:36.705
how much time
she has left either.

00:20:46.525 --> 00:20:48.395
[SEÑOR]
If only you hadn't met me,

00:20:48.428 --> 00:20:50.299
this would have never happened.

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:54.006
Honey. Thanks so much. [giggles]

00:20:57.515 --> 00:21:01.789
[SEÑOR] I'm sorry.
I didn't want to lose you.

00:21:01.822 --> 00:21:03.793
That's why I lied.

00:21:09.739 --> 00:21:13.646
[NURSE 715A] We see that man
come through a lot nowadays.

00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:15.951
[NURSE 715B] I heard he's
here to visit his wife.

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:21.729
[NURSE 715A] Oh. He brings her
flowers every day, you know.

00:21:21.762 --> 00:21:23.265
I'm kinda envious.

00:21:23.298 --> 00:21:24.400
[NURSE 715B]
Aww, don't say that.

00:21:24.434 --> 00:21:25.703
[NURSE 715A]
Hm?

00:21:29.043 --> 00:21:31.882
[SEÑOR]
I want to hear your voice.

00:21:34.453 --> 00:21:37.459
[SEÑOR]
I want to hear you laugh.

00:21:38.361 --> 00:21:40.700
[SEÑOR]
Just once more.

00:21:46.144 --> 00:21:49.918
[SEÑOR]
I want to see your smile.

00:22:00.574 --> 00:22:01.709
[gasps]

00:22:03.078 --> 00:22:05.015
[SEÑOR]
Just once more.

00:22:08.389 --> 00:22:09.792
Hey, Russian, look here.

00:22:09.825 --> 00:22:12.964
I found the same bonnet
that our Gimlet used to wear.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.302
[SEÑOR]
Don't I look like him?

00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:20.713
You used to say he had
my face. [chuckles]

00:22:23.953 --> 00:22:25.924
[SEÑOR]
I'll do anything.

00:22:25.957 --> 00:22:28.395
Just show me that smile.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.940
I-I'm sorry.
That was a poor joke.

00:22:33.974 --> 00:22:36.779
And just imagine,
if somebody saw me.

00:22:37.848 --> 00:22:38.883
[gasps]

00:22:42.156 --> 00:22:47.534
[gasping]

00:22:48.736 --> 00:22:53.445

Once more. Just once more.

a stand against Diamante,

the man who murdered his wife,

00:23:18.429 --> 00:23:20.633
in a harrowing
battle of vengeance.

00:23:20.667 --> 00:23:23.205
Just as it appears that
Diamante has the upper hand,

00:23:23.238 --> 00:23:25.877
Kyros, on the verge of death,
finds the fight in him

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.415
to preserve and shield
his daughter Rebecca

00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:30.352
from his murderous intent.
