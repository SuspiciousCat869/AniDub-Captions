00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,566
I didn't kick you that
hard, now did I?

He fights dirty!

185

00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:49,295
It's such a disgraceful sight
to see a grown man moaning.

197
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,864
I suppose now you
can see how foolish

198
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,867
it was to make an enemy
of the Buggy Pirates.

199
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,974

such a bad injury...

I don't know how he's
managing to stay in the fight.

there watching him?!

[ZORO] Is that enough
of a handicap for ya?

216
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,289
And now let me show you,

00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:17,216
A strong resolve keeps
you going. But have no fear.

227

Wounds as bad as yours

228
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,220
will be more than
enough of an excuse.

229
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,991
[CABAJI]
For losing to me!

230
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,492
[ZORO]
To hell with that.

231
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,062
If I lose to someone like you,

even with these
minimal injuries,

233
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,701

I can't believe the
Buggy Pirates...

...were defeated
by petty thieves.

I scored an impressive
haul from the Buggy Pirates.

00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,598
But hauling treasure is tiring.

338
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:36,468

the effort though.

you manage to make it there?
