1
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,750
Hey, what's wrong Usopp?
Come on!

2
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,086
The money, it, it disappeared!

3
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,087
Ahh!

4
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,755
Hey! Over there!

5
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:08,696
[BEARDFACE] Thanks for the cash!

6
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,299
Come back!

7
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,467
[MOHAWK] That was easy!

8
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,302
[USOPP]
You won't get away with this!

9
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,338
That looks like
the Franky Family.

10
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,441
Hey, those are our bags!
How did they get them?

11
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,475
Money! My money!

12
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,487
[COLLECTOR MAN A]
Hold it right there, Paulie!

13
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,489
You're not getting
away this time!

14
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,324
I'm telling you,
I'll get you the money,

15
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,493
you just have to
wait a little longer!

16
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,427
[ICEBERG]
Is that?

17
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,129
[KALIFA]
Yes, it's Paulie.

18
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,164
The debt collectors
are after him again.

19
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,333
[USOPP] Ah! Where are you
going with our money?!

20
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,803
Come back here and fight!

21
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,139
Buncha cowards,
I'm gonna make you pay!

22
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,807
Why'd you give our
money to those guys?

23
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,874
What do you take me for?!

24
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,311
I didn't give those jerks
anything, they stole it

25
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,178
What?!

26
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:00,180
[COLLECTOR MAN A]
Give us the money!

27
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,114
For the last time,

28
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,083
I can't give you
money if I don't have it!

29
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,387
[COLLECTOR MAN B]
Stop making excuses and pay up!

30
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,123
You're gonna chase me all the
way to my grave, aren't you?

31
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,491
Yagaras, and just in time, too!

32
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,461
Rope...

33
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:18,365
...Action!

34
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,266
Ahhh!

35
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,834
Hey, that's one of

36
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,035
the shipwrights from
Galley-La, ain't it?

37
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,471
[PAULIE] Sorry fellas, but
I gotta borrow those Yagaras!

38
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,640
Now! Time for my Round Turn!

39
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,141
Hyah!

40
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,214
[loud bam]

41
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,456
[chuckles]

42
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,099
You punk!

43
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,801
Just wait!
We'll get you next time!

44
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,637
So long, gentlemen, it was
a wonderful race, as always.

45
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,341
Take care and maybe you
can try again next week.

46
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,441
Damn it!

47
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,411
[PAULIE]
I gotta admit, for a Yagara,

48
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,180
you sure have a good
sense of dramatic timing.

49
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,319
That was close!

50
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,822
Those shipwrights of yours have
got some pretty fancy moves!

51
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,290
That they do.

52
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,359
Hey buddy, thanks for the help!

53
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,462
I was starting to think we'd
never see our money again!

54
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,197
Money?

55
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,731
Oh... He must mean this.

56
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:31,238
[USOPP]
Helloooooooo...?

57
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,239
You gotta be kidding me.

58
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,674
Hey! Come back here!

59
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,442
I'll take care of this!

60
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,210
Jerks stealing our stuff.

61
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,048
I'll get your money back.

62
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,317
Huh?! Wait, a pigeon?

63
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,427
[thinking] This is a manly
room if I've ever seen one.

64
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,096
And clean as a whistle, too.

65
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,232
Still, these floorboards are
showing some wear and tear.

66
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,780
What do you think you're
doing tearing apart our ship?!

67
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,516
Oh. Woke you up again, didn't I?

68
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,151
Don't worry, I'll put
things back together

69
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,119
once I check
under the floorboards.

70
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,289
Oh!

71
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,124
Hm?

72
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,126
[PAULIE]
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

73
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,363
Okay, lemme go! Lemme go!
Take it easy! Jeez!

74
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,431
I'm not gonna run away!

75
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:33,334
You got me!
You win, all right?!

76
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,302
You can stop
pinching my ear now!

77
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,503
Ow!

78
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,039
I was lucky enough to find
that money and you screw it up!

79
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,308
Better watch your back
Lucci, I'll remember this!

80
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,111
Don't pay back your debt with
someone else's money, idiot.

81
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,178
Have you no shame?

82
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,648
Hey, I happened upon
that money fair and square!

83
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,551
[HATTORI] Stealing from thieves
is still stealing! Coo coo!

84
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,585
[PAULIE]
I didn't steal anything.

85
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,221
I was just borrowing
their Yagara, that's all!

86
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,056
[ICEBERG]
Looks like they're back.

87
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,393
That's great! I'm glad things
worked out for you, Usopp!

88
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,694
Worked out for me?

89
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,731
That 200 million was for
ship repairs, remember?

90
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,233
That's right-and all
you did was sit there

91
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,269
and stare like a fool while
it nearly got carried away!

92
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:11,171
I know but that pigeon
said he'd handle it.

93
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,741
Mmwell, that was embarrassing.

94
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,710
Rest assured, we will deal
with our employee appropriately.

95
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,078
Allow us to handle this,

96
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,680
so there's no bad
blood between you.

97
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,649
Although Paulie's behavior
was reprehensible,

98
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,617
it's fortunate that
he saved your money

99
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,584
from the Franky Family.

100
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,587
Well. I guess you could
look at it that way.

101
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,491
No harm done, right?

102
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,493
So, who is this Franky Family?

103
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:35,362
Do they rob from everyone
they run into or just us?

104
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,599
Well, it depends, but normally,
they dismantle ships.

105
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:39,733
You mean they're workmen?

106
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:40,767
I don't know about you,

107
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,504
but I'd never hire a
team that looks like that.

108
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,173
Indeed. But they're
not just ship dismantlers,

109
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,508
they're also bounty hunters.

110
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,677
Every time they find out
there are pirates in town,

111
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,211
they cause quite a ruckus.

112
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,114
To put it simply, they're
just a public nuisance.

113
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,349
[ICEBERG] Not only do
they collect bounties

114
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:56,717
on the pirates they defeat,

115
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,086
they also take
possession of their ships.

116
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,588
Afterwards,
they dismantle them

117
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,157
and sell whatever parts
they can on the open market.

118
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,126
It may seem underhanded, but
for them, it's good business.

119
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,428
What a bunch of jerkwads!

120
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,762
It's like they're
trying to dismantle

121
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,331
the whole pirate lifestyle!

122
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:11,498
Mmwell. If they catch you,

123
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,233
they will certainly
bleed you dry.

124
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,270
I dunno, those guys looked
too weak to do anything to us.

125
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,706
The men you saw
were underlings.

126
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:22,176
Franky, the leader of the group,
is not nearly as harmless.

127
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:26,714
If I were you, I would
avoid him at any cost.

128
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:27,815
[ZAMBAI] Crap!

129
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,117
If it wasn't for that
shipwright we woulda had it!

130
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,519
Still hangin' in there, bro?

131
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,622
Uh, yeah,
I think I'm gonna make it.

132
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,656
Hey!

133
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,258
You know where the
Straw Hats are at right now?

134
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,692
No, uh, I guess

135
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,561
they might still be
over at Dock One.

136
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,503
Here you go, Iceberg.
Do with him as you will.

137
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,338
I'm here.
You can let go!

138
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,474
Excellent work
as always, Lucci.

139
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,242
Truly. I can't apologize enough

140
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,077
for the actions of
this oaf. Coo-Coo!

141
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,079
Ah! It is talking!

142
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,146
Coo coo!

143
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,150
Tell the nice people
that you're sorry, oaf!

144
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,621
That pigeon really has it
out for that dude, doesn't he?

145
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,457
So the little bird talks,
but the guy in the hat doesn't?

146
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,661
Anyway, I'm just glad
we got all our money back.

147
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,363
[PAULIE] Oh, so these
belong to you, huh?

148
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,698
Good thing I was around.

149
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,300
Yeah! Thanks a lot!

150
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,435
If you wanna
thank me, gimme 10%.

151
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,469
[bonk]

152
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,540
Again. I'm quite sorry.

153
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,743
This imbecile is addicted
to gambling, you see.

154
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,312
He's racked up
such a massive debt

155
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,514
that it's made him lose
sight of everything but greed.

156
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:34,582
I don't care about him,

157
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,550
I wanna know why
you're talking!

158
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,351
[PAULIE]
I've had about enough

159
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,653
of you running
your mouth, Lucci.

160
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,455
This'll shut you up.

161
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,456
Rope Action!

162
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,426
Coocalookakoo!

163
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,496
Bowline Knot!

164
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,601
Punishment!

165
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,241
Oh no! He's serious, isn't he?

166
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,345
Hook, line, and sinker!

167
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,768
Hook, line, and sinker!

168
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,341
Is he okay?

169
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,710
Mmwell. This is nothing new.

170
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,349
Huh? Whoa! Check it out!

171
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,517
I thought he
landed on his head,

172
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,454
but he stopped
himself with his arm!

173
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,490
Wow. Not only that,

174
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,792
but he dug his hand
into the ground!

175
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,461
What, does he have fingers
of steel or something?

176
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,463
These guys are
just shipwrights!

177
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,499
What do they need all
these crazy powers for?!

178
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,203
Hey, you with the
goggles on your head!

179
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,738
Huh?

180
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,374
Listen man, think
about this for a second!

181
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:11,078
That guy wasn't the one saying
all that mean stuff. It was...

182
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,546
...the pigeon!

183
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,486
The bird can say
whatever it wants!

184
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,790
Actions speak louder than words,
and Lucci's the one who hit me.

185
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,558
Yeah, but the pigeon
made him hit you

186
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,461
'cause he's too much of
a coward to do it himself!

187
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,797
Hey, pigeon!

188
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,365
Get down here and
fight your own fights!

189
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,735
Say something!

190
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,442
Coo coo!

191
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,077
Oh, you want some more?

192
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,645
I'll take you on any time!

193
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,346
Enough, Paulie.

194
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:50,718
Coocoolookoo, please
excuse us for all the fuss!

195
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,486
I'm Rob Lu--

196
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,256
I mean, my name's Hattori.
And this is Rob Lucci.

197
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,758
We both welcome you
to Galley-La's factory.

198
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,059
Cookoolookoo!

199
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,293
Hold on.

200
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,596
The pigeon almost introduced
himself as that guy, didn't he?

201
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:06,600
Oh! Cool! This is a
ventriloquism act, isn't it?!

202
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:10,037
Really?! You were the coolest
trash talking pigeon ever!

203
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,205
Even I couldn't tell it was you

204
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,140
and I'm usually pretty sharp!

205
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,243
No, please. It's really nothing
special at all. Coo coo!

206
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,280
Hahahaha! He's just a
weirdo who doesn't know how

207
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:20,514
to talk to people on his own.

208
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:21,749
Hahahaha.

209
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,450
Ahhh!!

210
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,384
Hold on a second,

211
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,253
what does that woman
think she's doing?!

212
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,455
Huh? What do you mean?

213
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,323
Have you no shame?!

214
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,761
[PAULIE] Don't play dumb
with me, you harlot!

215
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,730
I can see way too much leg!

216
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,199
Cover up and show a
little decency, will ya?!

217
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,368
This dock is a man's
workplace, you know!

218
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,636
Now now, Paulie.

219
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,438
[KALIFA]
Let's calm down.

220
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,107
Ahhh!

221
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,045
You too, Kalifa!

222
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,046
How many times
have I told you

223
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,348
those clothes of yours
are not appropriate?!

224
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,516
If you want to
look professional

225
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,252
you should wear pants or at
least ankle-length skirts!

226
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,286
This guy's got issues.

227
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,621
He's serious, isn't he?

228
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,257
Hahahaha!

229
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,392
[ICEBERG]
Mmwell enough of that.

230
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,028
Let's open the gate and
start the tour already.

231
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,808
That's just about the
biggest door I've ever seen.

232
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:21,642
And whoa!

233
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:24,345
You have to open
that thing by hand?!

234
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:27,247
Wait those two can't do
that on their own, right?

235
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,218
Wow, I guess they can!

236
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,054
Mmwell, each dock
only has five foremen,

237
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,356
and despite
their peculiarities,

238
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,224
these two are both
talented enough

239
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,560
to hold a position at Dock 1.

240
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,229
Kaku, who you met
earlier, is a foreman too.

241
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,299
In a place like this, talent
is the only thing that matters.

242
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,735
So even if they're a bit
strange, we don't mind.

243
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,303
They are pretty weird, though.

244
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,305
Ah! We can go in now!

245
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,340
Remember to keep a
close eye on your money.

246
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,176
Not that I'm saying we
have thieves inside, mind you.

247
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,113
Yeah. I'm really sorry you
got dragged into that mess--

248
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,614
I shoulda known better.

249
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,283
Luffy, wait!

250
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:05,052
Do a better job of
protecting me next time around!

251
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,288
Okay, no problem! I got this!

252
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:08,289
I'm worried.

253
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:10,758
[ICEBERG] Dock 1 employs
the strongest workers

254
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,426
of the Galley-La Company.

255
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,596
We take on our most
difficult requests here.

256
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,364
Come on, let's
take a look inside.

257
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,632
[STRAW HAT CREW gasps]

258
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,104
Whooooa!!

259
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,117
[LUFFY]
It's super huge!

260
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,452
I knew it was
gonna be awesome,

261
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,254
but it's even
better up close!

262
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,255
No kidding!

263
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,389
Yeah!

264
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,457
[USOPP]
Ooh, look over there!

265
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,125
They're building a big galleon!

266
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,460
I wonder who it's for?

267
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,796
[NAMI] Wow, they've got a
full force working here.

268
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:53,667
[ICEBERG]
Now, this way, if you will.

269
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,170
Whoa, you guys see
that? Iceberg's here!

270
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:59,306
Hey! Look sharp for
the boss, everyone!

271
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,508
[CRAFTSMAN C]
Good morning Mr. Iceberg!

272
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,444
Nice to see you here, Sir!

273
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:04,445
[CRAFTSMAN E]
Hey Boss!

274
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:06,580
Could you take a look at
the outer panels for me?

275
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:09,149
Sure. I'll stop by later.

276
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,218
[CRAFTSMAN F] Lovely day
ain't it, Mr. Iceberg?

277
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,088
Mmwell, that depends on
how the project's going.

278
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:15,656
[CRAFTSMAN F] We're actually
ahead of schedule, Sir!

279
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,727
I guess Ice Pops is pretty
popular around here, huh?

280
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,528
In a place where
skill is everything,

281
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,430
it's only natural
that he shines.

282
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:24,631
It's interesting.

283
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,101
Although, shipbuilding has
always been a thriving business,

284
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,702
before Iceberg's
time it was divided

285
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,305
between seven
competing companies.

286
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,606
Regardless, when he showed up

287
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,174
there was something
about his talent

288
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,410
that united
everyone in the city.

289
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:37,678
With so many workers
flocking to him,

290
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,781
it wasn't long before he made
the seven companies into one.

291
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,717
And five years ago,
Galley-La was born.

292
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,220
His passion for shipbuilding
has never diminished

293
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:50,291
and neither has the respect
that the craftsmen show for him.

294
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:52,159
The people here take
pride in their work,

295
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,694
so they don't
bow down to anyone.

296
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:57,197
That goes for pirates
and Marine officers alike.

297
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,302
That's the spirit
this shipyard embodies.

298
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:03,571
[LUFFY] Hey buddy, I heard
you're a pretty good shipwright.

299
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:05,372
How would ya feel
about joining my crew?

300
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,439
Sound like fun?

301
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,442
What the hell are you
trying to pull here, kid?!

302
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,677
You insolent little wretch!

303
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,112
Now, now, he was trying
to pay him a compliment!

304
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,447
He doesn't know any better!

305
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,748
Does this mean you
sailed all the way

306
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,318
to Water 7 without any
shipwrights on your crew?

307
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:19,486
Yeah, that's one of the
reasons why we're here.

308
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,754
We need to have
our ship repaired,

309
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,257
but we're looking for
a new crewmember, too.

310
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,793
We certainly have plenty
of shipwrights to go around

311
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:27,294
but I wonder if any of
them would be willing

312
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,729
to join a pirate ship.

313
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,598
Mmwell, if you can find
someone who agrees

314
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,566
to go with you,
I won't get in the way.

315
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,534
You really mean it?

316
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,603
Wow, I see why people like you.

317
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:37,538
My offer still
stands, you know.

318
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:40,474
Mmwell I probably
shouldn't. I am the mayor.

319
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:41,641
So what?

320
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,547
By the way, Kalifa mentioned
earlier that Nico Robin

321
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,749
was a member of your
crew--is that correct?

322
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:49,816
Sure is!

323
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,253
She's nice to have around
since she's so smart.

324
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,355
Hahahaha!

325
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,090
Huh? What's up?

326
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,392
There's not something
wrong with her, is there?

327
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,393
Oh, no.

328
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,061
So anyway, it's okay

329
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,063
if I check out that
ship up close, right?

330
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,065
Of course.
I wouldn't mind at all.

331
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,666
Haha! Thanks!

332
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,210
I could watch them
do this stuff all day!

333
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,179
[CRAFTSMAN G]
Keep it steady!

334
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,147
No need to rush, we got this!

335
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,451
We gotta get a cannon like
that to put on the Merry!

336
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,353
That'd be awesome.

337
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,756
Whoa! It's so
shiny! And long!

338
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,724
A real demi-culverin cannon.

339
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:34,428
Wow. They've really
got everything! Hahaha!

340
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,796
I wonder what it feels
like to fire one of those!

341
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,466
Here's our chance.

342
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,235
[USOPP]
Looks like it's made of copper.

343
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,070
I bet it's super expensive.

344
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,806
Ooh! I wonder if
they'd let me try it out.

345
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,776
Oh, wait a sec. We've got
300 million Berries.

346
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:49,843
I almost forgot!

347
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:52,212
We can afford at least
one of those, no problem!

348
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,814
Maybe two or three!

349
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,215
Ah!

350
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,523
Hm?

351
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:04,624
Did that guy with
the nose leave already?

352
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:09,530
Robin was right there,
where did she go?

353
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:10,598
Hm?

354
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:11,665
[sniffs]

355
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,066
This way.

356
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:19,273
[sniffing]

357
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:21,208
Hm? I know this smell.

358
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,612
I thought so!

359
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,450
It's bad enough
that Robin ignored me,

360
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:32,686
but who was that guy in
the mask she was with?

361
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,321
Wasn't Chopper, was it?

362
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,289
[CHOPPER]
Sanji!

363
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,759
Speak of the Devil.

364
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,674
[PAULIE]
Huh? Kaku...

365
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:54,742
Where'd you run off to?

366
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:56,143
An assessment.

367
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,544
Wow, you are fast, huh?

368
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,046
I take it you checked the ship?

369
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,547
That I did, missy.

370
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,116
Now that's a coincidence.

371
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,584
We were wondering
where you were.

372
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:05,286
They told me why they're here.

373
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,221
How was the ship?

374
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,290
About that.

375
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:12,525
Luffy! Get down here!

376
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,395
Hm?

377
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:17,364
Okay! Be right there!

378
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,314
What? You better not be lying.

379
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:34,315
Cause if this is a joke,

380
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:36,617
I'm sure as hell not laughing.

381
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,652
I wouldn't lie about
something like this.

382
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,353
I'm a professional.

383
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:57,371
Did something happen to Usopp?

384
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,073
Well. He was looking
at the cannons

385
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:01,508
over there a
second ago, but--

386
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,479
Hey! You there!

387
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,614
These bags are
yours, aren't they?

388
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:13,254
Ugh... Usopp was supposed
to be taking care of those.

389
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:14,321
But yeah, they're ours.

390
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:15,689
Thanks, buddy!

391
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,524
I can't believe that
idiot wandering off

392
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:18,725
at a time like this.

393
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,362
And how could he leave our
precious money alone like that?!

394
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:22,596
Your money?

395
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,233
Yeah, those bags you found have
200 million berries in them.

396
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:31,272
[chuckles] You're funny kid!
Ha! You wish! See ya!

397
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:32,305
Hahah. That's a good one.

398
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,778
So how much do you think
the repairs are gonna cost?

399
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:39,613
We've got plenty
of money to spend.

400
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,415
And no price is too
high for our Merry!

401
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:44,985
And while you're at it.

402
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,553
Why don't you make
her stronger, faster,

403
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:50,424
as tough as nails and of
course decked out with cannons!

404
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,759
I'd like some pretty engravings

405
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:54,395
or some kind of
decoration along the hull.

406
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:57,331
Also, can you guys
renovate the inside?

407
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,632
Oh, and a big statue, too!

408
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:03,137
And when I say big,
I mean huge, kay?

409
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,371
Not so fast.

410
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,241
That ship of yours.

411
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:08,375
She's gone on some really

412
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,545
extraordinary
journeys, hasn't she?

413
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,581
Yeah, you bet,
we've done it all!

414
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:16,317
A while back we flew in the
sky, then fell back down.

415
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,818
We climbed a big mountain, too!

416
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:21,321
So, you gotta work hard to
fix her up extra good, okay?

417
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:25,426
You don't think
I'm lying, do you?

418
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:26,793
That's not the issue.

419
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:31,832
Her battle scars are
far worse than you think.

420
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:33,534
Uhm... Then you're
saying it's gonna

421
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,270
take a long time
for you to fix her?

422
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:39,607
No, Ma'am.
It's not about the time.

423
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,710
It's not about skill, either.

424
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:46,012
I'm saying no one can
fix her. Not even us.

425
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,763
So that means the
keel's damaged, huh?

426
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:06,800
That's right. It looks like
it's taken a real wallop.

427
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,034
No way.

428
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:12,106
We... We've gone everywhere
without any problems until now!

429
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:16,543
In theory, even if we
did everything we could.

430
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:20,080
The probability of your ship
lasting 'til the next island...

431
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:24,618
...is zero.

432
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,399
Merry tell me.

433
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,501
Is what he said true?

434
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:42,369
You'll never sail again?

435
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:02,656
♪ ending song ♪

436
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:16,363
[LUFFY] Hey, Merry.
Can you really not sail anymore?

437
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,499
[PAULIE] Sorry, but the
damage is too severe.

438
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:19,667
[NAMI]
It can't be.

439
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,569
[PAULIE] The only thing left
is to turn her into scrap.

440
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:22,670
[NAMI]
Don't even say that!

441
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:24,805
[LUFFY] Then what's all
this money good for anyway?!

442
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,507
[NAMI] Wait!
The money's gone!

443
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,708
[LUFFY]
Usopp's gone too!

444
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,243
[NAMI]
What's going on here?!

445
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:30,611
[LUFFY]
On the next <i>One Piece</i> :

446
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:32,146
"Pirate Abduction Incident

447
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,748
and A Pirate Ship That
Can Only Await Her End."

448
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:37,384
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
