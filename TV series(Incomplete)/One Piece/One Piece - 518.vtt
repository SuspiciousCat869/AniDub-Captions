00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:05.205
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:08.208
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:10.977
Smiling, even as he stood
upon the scaffold,

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.213
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.414
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.515
You can have it!

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.218
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:20.487
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.355
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:26.459
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:00:27.168 --> 00:00:29.659
I can’t stand still, I can’t stop
jitto dekinai tomarenai

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.900
Daybreak hasn’t come yet and I can’t wait

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.700
Fly the flag, Break of Romance Dawn

Make waves, jump from your sleep

If you want to go to the unbelievable world

your toughness, that’s what it takes

Being brazen, is it a crime?

Freedom is our only rule

It's not our way to worry

At any cost, One Piece, I’ll be the first

My dreaming heart is huge

Keep going forward, that’s our pledge

Since the day that the dream began

the future that I’m
aiming at hasn’t changed

One, two, Sunshine four...WE GO!

00:02:35.117 --> 00:02:36.549
[NARRATOR]
It's been two years

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.584
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:39.996
Scattered across the world,

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:41.787
Luffy and his crew underwent
special training

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:44.206
to prepare for the trials ahead.

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:45.691
Now, they return to the
Sabaody Archipelago

00:02:45.724 --> 00:02:48.060
and move forward to the
next stage of their journey:

00:02:48.093 --> 00:02:49.828
The New World.

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:54.867
Well.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.170
[ZORO] Oh, yeah?
Nobody else has shown up?

00:03:03.342 --> 00:03:05.711
How 'bout you check
that poster again?

00:03:05.744 --> 00:03:09.281
If your bounty is under 70
million, then we don't want you.

00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:13.752
So why don't you take your weak
ass back to pirate daycare?

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.989
Too late.

00:03:18.857 --> 00:03:22.127
I'm only going to say this once.

00:03:22.161 --> 00:03:24.163
You can take your
offer and shove it,

00:03:24.196 --> 00:03:25.831
'cause I'm way out
of your league.

00:03:25.864 --> 00:03:28.500
Special Attack, Green Star...

00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:29.868
..."Devil"!

00:03:32.304 --> 00:03:34.306
[FAKE NAMI screaming]

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.409
Hey there, beautiful.
Can I buy you a drink?

00:03:37.443 --> 00:03:38.310
[NAMI gasps]

00:03:41.313 --> 00:03:42.348
[chuckles]

00:03:42.381 --> 00:03:47.253
[SOUL KING FANS cheering]

00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:49.455
Come on, baby!

00:03:49.488 --> 00:03:51.457
[SOUL KING FANS]
Yeah!

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.626
I love you down to my...

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.828
[SOUL KING FANS]
...bones!

00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:56.962
[SANJI]
I hope not!

00:03:56.996 --> 00:04:00.599
Thanks for the ride and say
hi to Iva, but go away!

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:02.334
[ROBIN]
Brook is holding a concert

00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:05.604
and the Straw Hats are
looking for new recruits?

00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:08.207
Goodness, I've been
gone for too long.

00:04:10.643 --> 00:04:12.778
[FRANKY] Sorry to keep
you waitin', Sunny.

00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:14.880
We'll be sailin' off soon.

00:04:14.913 --> 00:04:17.383
[chuckles]

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:18.984
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:19.018 --> 00:04:20.219
[gasps]

00:04:22.187 --> 00:04:23.255
[LUFFY]
Uh?

00:04:24.023 --> 00:04:26.292
Oops. Didn't see ya there.

00:04:26.325 --> 00:04:29.228
Sorry 'bout that. See ya.

00:04:31.764 --> 00:04:33.399
Get back here!

00:04:37.036 --> 00:04:38.337
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.911
[LUFFY] "An Explosive Situation!
Luffy vs. Fake Luffy!"

00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:57.089
[WOMAN A chuckles]

00:05:06.432 --> 00:05:08.100
Not good.

00:05:10.703 --> 00:05:14.006
[HANCOCK] There in the distance
is Sabaody Archipelago.

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.507
Forgive me, Luffy,

00:05:15.541 --> 00:05:17.576
but we will have to say
our goodbyes here.

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:21.780
We cannot let anyone discover
the nature of our relationship.

00:05:21.814 --> 00:05:23.015
[LUFFY]
Uh-huh.

00:05:23.048 --> 00:05:25.351
[HANCOCK]
I've prepared...

00:05:25.384 --> 00:05:26.518
...a disguise for you.

00:05:26.552 --> 00:05:28.187
[LUFFY]
Ha-ha. Are you kidding?

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.588
I can't pull that look off!

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:33.459
Perhaps. But I would still feel
more at ease if you took it.

00:05:33.492 --> 00:05:35.194
[LUFFY]
All right.

00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:36.895
[HANCOCK]
You must be careful.

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:40.566
Keep your face hidden
at all times.

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.769
The world may believe you've
been dead these last two years,

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.038
but that won't stop anyone
from recognizing you

00:05:46.071 --> 00:05:47.906
the first time you
get into trouble.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.908
So if you ever want
to set sail again,

00:05:49.942 --> 00:05:51.877
you'll take my advice to heart.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.545
[LUFFY]
Thanks. I'll try.

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:54.546
You're welcome.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.216
Now, for supplies,
I've loaded your backpack

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:59.651
with 50 changes of
clothes, 1,000 lunches,

00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:01.220
handkerchiefs, and tissues.

00:06:01.253 --> 00:06:03.088
You'll also find three
years' worth of water,

00:06:03.122 --> 00:06:04.823
snacks, and bug bite ointment.

00:06:04.857 --> 00:06:07.426
There's also five years' worth
of towels, toothbrushes,

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:09.561
plenty of soaps, hand creams,
and lots of silverware.

00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:11.397
That is entirely too much!

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.998
[HANCOCK giggles]

00:06:14.533 --> 00:06:17.136
Well, I hope you can
find all your friends.

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.005
[LUFFY] Thanks again for getting
me here and all the other stuff.

00:06:20.038 --> 00:06:20.873
[MARGARET chuckles]

00:06:20.906 --> 00:06:22.574
We were more than
happy to help you.

00:06:22.608 --> 00:06:24.910
Your most difficult trials
may still be ahead of you.

00:06:24.943 --> 00:06:27.112
I hear that Sabaody has
become a den of crime.

00:06:27.146 --> 00:06:28.380
[NYON]
Mh-hm.

00:06:28.414 --> 00:06:30.616
And because of that, the Navy
has been keeping a tight watch

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:32.951
over the goings-on there
as of late, my boy.

00:06:32.985 --> 00:06:35.187
So be sure to take extra care!

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.188
[LUFFY]
Right.

00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:37.456
[HANCOCK]
If you ever need assistance,

00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:40.159
the full force of the Kuja
Pirates will come rushing

00:06:40.192 --> 00:06:42.294
to your aide at a
moment's notice.

00:06:42.327 --> 00:06:44.696
Please, don't hesitate
to call on us.

00:06:46.398 --> 00:06:49.201
Also, would you be willing
to do me a favor?

00:06:49.234 --> 00:06:51.637
Yeah, maybe. Long as
it's not getting married.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.272
No, no.

00:06:53.305 --> 00:06:54.840
All I ask is that,
when you leave,

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:58.210
you do so without
saying "farewell."

00:06:58.243 --> 00:06:59.211
That all?

00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:01.713
I've never said that to
anyone before, so sure!

00:07:01.747 --> 00:07:03.649
Besides, I wanna see you again!

00:07:03.682 --> 00:07:04.783
[HANCOCK squeals]

00:07:04.817 --> 00:07:08.287
[chuckles]

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.289
[LUFFY]
All right! I'm outta here!

00:07:10.322 --> 00:07:12.891
[AMAZONS bidding adieu]

00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:14.960
You take care!

00:07:14.993 --> 00:07:16.161
[HANCOCK]
Oh, my.

00:07:16.195 --> 00:07:18.230
He wants to see me again.

00:07:18.263 --> 00:07:22.167
That's practically
a... a proposal!

00:07:22.201 --> 00:07:24.870
No, it's not!

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.877
Hancock told me I gotta stay
outta trouble and lay low.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.579
I don't wanna fight this guy.

00:07:33.612 --> 00:07:37.749
Hey, dummy. Did you
run into me on purpose?

00:07:37.783 --> 00:07:40.953
[MAN AA] Oh, no. He's gonna
kill that poor guy!

00:07:42.421 --> 00:07:43.522
[SANJI]
You're kidding me.

00:07:43.555 --> 00:07:45.357
You're saying the swordsman
who barely knows

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.793
left from right got here first?

00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:49.094
Well, whaddaya know?

00:07:49.127 --> 00:07:52.030
Maybe he learned how to read
a map while he was training.

00:07:52.064 --> 00:07:54.700
After him came Franky,
about ten days ago now,

00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:56.034
but he headed back out to go see

00:07:56.068 --> 00:07:57.870
if your ship was
doing all right.

00:07:57.903 --> 00:08:00.105
I hope that means the
Sunny is in good shape.

00:08:00.138 --> 00:08:02.574
[RAYLEIGH] Of course. There
isn't a single scratch on it.

00:08:02.608 --> 00:08:04.543
We finished the coating, too.

00:08:04.576 --> 00:08:05.644
[SANJI]
That's good to hear.

00:08:05.677 --> 00:08:08.113
Just make sure you give
credit where credit's due.

00:08:08.146 --> 00:08:11.049
Even if he don't, there's no
shame in a wound of honor.

00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:14.119
[FISH RIDERS]
It's time for some R'n'R!

00:08:14.152 --> 00:08:17.022
Who knew you'd be so
dedicated to the cause?

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.958
Your stubbornness came in handy.

00:08:19.992 --> 00:08:21.426
Y'mean my looks?

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.761
[DUVAL laughs]

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:25.063
Don't mention it.
I owed you one anyway!

00:08:25.097 --> 00:08:27.099
Come rain or shine,
it changed nothin'.

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:30.269
Dangerous pirates from all
over came to take that ship.

00:08:30.302 --> 00:08:31.904
Didn't matter how
bad I was hurt,

00:08:31.937 --> 00:08:33.672
I defended it day after day.

00:08:33.705 --> 00:08:36.241
'Cause I knew all these
bruises would be worth it!

00:08:36.275 --> 00:08:38.410
[BOTH]
You're so amazing, sir!

00:08:38.443 --> 00:08:39.978
Pirates messed
you up? Come on.

00:08:40.012 --> 00:08:41.780
What's the real
story here, Duval?

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:43.015
Don't be impatient.

00:08:43.048 --> 00:08:45.317
I'm tryin' to build up the
suspense here, y'know?

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.552
Y'see...

00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:48.687
[SHAKKY] The third member of
your crew to arrive was Nami.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.156
Nami!

00:08:51.189 --> 00:08:53.692
That's great! Is she still here?

00:08:53.725 --> 00:08:56.261
She decided to kill time by
getting some shopping done.

00:08:56.295 --> 00:08:58.430
C'mon, don'tcha wanna hear
the rest of I story?

00:08:58.463 --> 00:09:02.134
Nami's shopping. Nami's
shopping. Nami's shopping...

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.870
The fourth one to arrive
was Usopp three days ago,

00:09:04.903 --> 00:09:06.138
who also went into town

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:08.840
Followed by Chopper,
who showed up yesterday.

00:09:08.874 --> 00:09:09.942
Brook's made it, too.

00:09:09.975 --> 00:09:12.477
He's putting on a concert
for the islanders today.

00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:14.379
[SANJI]
No way.

00:09:14.413 --> 00:09:16.048
Whoa. Well, I'll be damned.

00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:18.784
You're the last to stop by,
which makes seven in total.

00:09:18.817 --> 00:09:20.385
Not that I expected any less,

00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:23.956
but almost the entire crew has
made it back in good time.

00:09:23.989 --> 00:09:27.292
[RAYLEIGH] That's right. Only
Nico Robin and Luffy remain.

00:09:27.326 --> 00:09:29.861
Getting to this island in the
first place is a difficult task

00:09:29.895 --> 00:09:31.730
for any crew to accomplish.

00:09:31.763 --> 00:09:34.333
And yet, you've made
it twice. What can I say?

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:36.969
You must be eager to
see each other again.

00:09:37.002 --> 00:09:38.170
Yeah.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:40.339
And by the way, I still can't
believe you trained Luffy

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:41.707
while we were gone.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.509
He must be crazy strong now.

00:09:44.543 --> 00:09:46.712
He's been on his own
these last six months.

00:09:46.745 --> 00:09:49.314
I can't wait to see how his
skills have developed.

00:09:49.348 --> 00:09:52.384
[SANJI]
Now that you... mention it.

00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:54.586
I can't wait to see
how Nami's developed,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.188
if you know what I'm sayin'!

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.823
[RAYLEIGH]
I should've expected that.

00:09:57.856 --> 00:10:00.325
Hey. Are you all right?

00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:03.095
Heh. I endured two years
of arduous training

00:10:03.128 --> 00:10:05.097
just like everybody else.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.232
I'm more resilient than ever.

00:10:07.265 --> 00:10:10.102
Showing no sign of seduction.

00:10:10.135 --> 00:10:11.036
[DUVAL]
Tch.

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.104
[FISH RIDERS]
You have to wipe yer nose

00:10:12.137 --> 00:10:14.439
before anyone believes that!

00:10:14.473 --> 00:10:15.407
[gunshot]

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.608
[WOMAN E screaming]

00:10:16.642 --> 00:10:18.543
[PEOPLE chattering]

00:10:18.577 --> 00:10:20.112
[MAN B]
Run!

00:10:20.145 --> 00:10:22.614
Those lousy thugs!
Always fighting!

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:25.851
[MAN BB] I kinda thought the
pirates were gonna settle down

00:10:25.884 --> 00:10:27.386
once Whitebeard died.

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:28.520
[MAN CC]
Man, I wish!

00:10:28.553 --> 00:10:30.756
Instead, they're coming in
from all over the place.

00:10:30.789 --> 00:10:34.793
We're overrun with them! Our
entire island is a lawless mess!

00:10:34.826 --> 00:10:37.963
It's dangerous. I had no
idea things were so bad.

00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:39.631
[PIRATE C yells]

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:42.868
Have ya learned your lesson?!

00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:44.970
It may look like Blackbeard,
Kid, and Drake

00:10:45.003 --> 00:10:47.472
are runnin' things in the New
World, but look again!

00:10:47.506 --> 00:10:50.108
Now, it's only a matter
of time until we follow.

00:10:50.142 --> 00:10:52.310
I mean, beat them
at their own game!

00:10:52.344 --> 00:10:55.113
[PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:10:55.147 --> 00:10:56.381
[MAN D]
Uh?

00:10:56.415 --> 00:10:57.649
It can't be.

00:10:57.683 --> 00:11:00.452
[MAN E] The rumors are true,
just like I thought.

00:11:00.485 --> 00:11:02.587
The Navy didn't kill
them two years ago.

00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:04.322
They didn't even capture them.

00:11:04.356 --> 00:11:05.490
And now they're
back on the island,

00:11:05.524 --> 00:11:07.325
ready to start trouble again.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.629
Right, and ever since
they got back here,

00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:13.732
they've become the most powerful
pirate group on the island, too.

00:11:13.765 --> 00:11:15.400
The Straw Hats. They're here.

00:11:15.434 --> 00:11:17.736
[CHOPPER]
Really? Is it Nami? Or Usopp?

00:11:17.769 --> 00:11:20.972
No. It's too soon.

00:11:21.006 --> 00:11:22.741
That's "Pirate Hunter" Zoro.

00:11:22.774 --> 00:11:25.811
He's got a 120
million Berry bounty.

00:11:27.112 --> 00:11:28.947
[MAN E] And "Black Foot"
Sanji's with him.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.683
His bounty's up to 77 million.

00:11:33.118 --> 00:11:34.319
[MAN E] But that's nothing
when you consider

00:11:34.352 --> 00:11:37.255
that Nico Robin there's had
a bounty since she was eight.

00:11:37.289 --> 00:11:39.791
She's worth 80 million.

00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:41.093
Then there's their pet,

00:11:41.126 --> 00:11:43.495
the cotton-candy-lover
Tony Tony Chopper.

00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:44.629
Fifty Berry bounty.

00:11:44.663 --> 00:11:46.164
[MAN EE]
Pocket change!

00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:53.939
Let me through! Is Luffy there?

00:11:53.972 --> 00:11:56.441
Hey! Move! You're
blocking my view!

00:11:56.475 --> 00:11:58.443
This is the perfect
opportunity for us!

00:11:58.477 --> 00:11:59.277
Let's take 'em!

00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:00.312
[PIRATE CAPTAIN A]
Wait!

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:02.614
Why are you holdin'
us back, Captain?

00:12:02.647 --> 00:12:03.982
If we cause trouble with them,

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:05.851
there's nothin' that'll
stop Straw Hat Luffy

00:12:05.884 --> 00:12:07.819
from comin' after our heads.

00:12:07.853 --> 00:12:10.355
We don't need that kind of
fight barrelin' down on us.

00:12:10.388 --> 00:12:13.658
Especially not right before
we go to the New World.

00:12:18.497 --> 00:12:20.999
[BOTH chuckle]

00:12:22.167 --> 00:12:25.871
[CHOPPER]
Hey! Zoro, Sanji!

00:12:25.904 --> 00:12:28.640
Stop! Robin, wait for me!

00:12:28.673 --> 00:12:29.808
[FAKE ZORO]
Huh?

00:12:29.841 --> 00:12:32.077
I think that raccoon's
tryin' to talk to us.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.379
[FAKE SANJI] Huh? Are you
listenin' to yourself, man?

00:12:34.412 --> 00:12:36.515
Everybody knows
raccoons can't talk.

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:37.749
Are you sure?

00:12:37.783 --> 00:12:40.685
I can't believe you were the
first one to make it here, Zoro!

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:42.654
I thought you'd
get lost for sure.

00:12:42.687 --> 00:12:46.091
And, Sanji, Robin, I'm glad to
see you made it safe and sound!

00:12:46.124 --> 00:12:48.360
Ya see, what'd I tell ya?

00:12:49.694 --> 00:12:51.229
I dunno what that's
supposed to be,

00:12:51.263 --> 00:12:54.199
but it could spell big trouble
for us if we're not careful.

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:55.367
Let's go.

00:12:57.035 --> 00:12:58.937
Hey, slow down!

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.406
Don't leave me behind, you guys!

00:13:01.439 --> 00:13:04.176
Our target, Nico Robin,
has Devil Fruit powers.

00:13:04.209 --> 00:13:06.511
We can't afford to fight
someone like her alone.

00:13:06.545 --> 00:13:09.247
Our only hope is to try
and catch her off guard.

00:13:11.716 --> 00:13:12.951
It's been a while.

00:13:12.984 --> 00:13:15.587
Surely the others have
made it back by now.

00:13:16.922 --> 00:13:18.757
I can't wait for Nami
and Robin to get here

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.059
so they can try my new
and improved recipes!

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:22.961
But before they can,
I'll have to make sure

00:13:22.994 --> 00:13:25.964
the Sunny's kitchen
is up to my standards.

00:13:25.997 --> 00:13:28.433
I'd better stock it
full of ingredients!

00:13:30.402 --> 00:13:32.971
Was that... Sanji?

00:13:34.306 --> 00:13:36.708
So whaddaya gotta
say for yourself?

00:13:36.741 --> 00:13:38.076
Ya can't tell me you didn't know

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:41.046
who I was when ya
crashed in ta me.

00:13:41.079 --> 00:13:42.480
Why do it?

00:13:42.514 --> 00:13:44.950
Were you just tryin' to
make a fool outta me?

00:13:44.983 --> 00:13:49.120
'Cause if so, I don't like
bein' shown up in public.

00:13:49.154 --> 00:13:50.822
After all, I have a reputation

00:13:50.856 --> 00:13:54.426
and a 400 million Berry
bounty to uphold.

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:57.662
But you can make it up
to me... by kneeling.

00:13:57.696 --> 00:14:00.632
Beg for your life and
I might feel generous.

00:14:02.167 --> 00:14:05.637
[FAKE FRANKY,
FAKE NAMI chuckle]

00:14:32.898 --> 00:14:34.566
[MAN G]
Come on.

00:14:34.599 --> 00:14:36.801
Just apologize already!

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:39.704
[MAN FF] Don't you have
something you wanna live for?

00:14:39.738 --> 00:14:40.972
[FAKE LUFFY]
Heh.

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:43.575
Well, kid? What'cha thinkin'?

00:14:43.608 --> 00:14:46.144
You screwed up and
now it's time to pay!

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:47.746
So, speak up.

00:14:48.747 --> 00:14:50.482
Please! Take a look
at that brat.

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:52.651
Obviously you scared
him silent, Captain!

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:53.485
[FAKE NAMI laughs]

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.220
I can't blame the kid.

00:14:55.253 --> 00:14:56.688
After that guy with the schnoz

00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:58.890
and that chick with the long
hair picked a fight with us,

00:14:58.924 --> 00:15:01.192
we're in a worse
mood than usual.

00:15:01.226 --> 00:15:03.695
Now, if you don't wanna be
our personal punching bag,

00:15:03.728 --> 00:15:06.164
you'd best ask forgiveness.

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.166
Kneel! Get down in the dirt!

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:09.501
Forget your pride.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:11.536
Otherwise, you're gonna end up
throwin' your life away

00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:13.505
over some small mistake.

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:16.908
After all, our captain's trigger
finger can be a little twitchy.

00:15:17.943 --> 00:15:20.278
[chuckles]

00:15:20.312 --> 00:15:21.780
[MAN H]
C'mon, kid, just do it!

00:15:21.813 --> 00:15:24.549
You shouldn't mess around
with Straw Hat Luffy!

00:15:24.582 --> 00:15:27.218
[MAN I] You're gonna die if
you don't do what he says!

00:15:27.252 --> 00:15:29.387
[LUFFY]
All right, look. I'm sorry.

00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:31.389
Now I got somewhere to be.

00:15:32.824 --> 00:15:35.727
[ALL]
What's wrong with you?

00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:45.270
Bad move. Say goodbye, punk!

00:15:46.438 --> 00:15:48.106

[ALL gasping]

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.505
[MAN GG]
What happened?

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:27.545
[MAN HH] Hey. That guy...
Did he do somethin'?

00:16:30.148 --> 00:16:32.117
[LUFFY]
Guess Hancock was right.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.619
Maybe I do need to
wear that thing.

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:41.493
[CHOPPER]
Hey, guys! What's the matter?

00:16:41.526 --> 00:16:42.961
C'mon, talk to me!

00:16:42.994 --> 00:16:44.796
I thought you'd be more
excited to see me,

00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:46.865
but you're acting weird!

00:16:46.898 --> 00:16:47.932
From the looks of things,

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:50.635
you've all changed a lot
over these last two years.

00:16:50.668 --> 00:16:52.003
But, I mean,
we're still friends,

00:16:52.037 --> 00:16:54.105
so why are you ignoring me?

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:56.274
Yo, man. It's not leaving.

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:59.344
Oh, you must be shy 'cause of
how much I've changed, too!

00:16:59.377 --> 00:17:00.612
And if you ask me,

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:03.348
that furball knows a little bit
too much about us "Straw Hats,"

00:17:03.381 --> 00:17:04.649
if you know what I mean.

00:17:04.682 --> 00:17:07.218
Yeah, I do, and ya gotta
wonder why that is.

00:17:07.252 --> 00:17:09.587
Maybe we can find
the answer here.

00:17:10.722 --> 00:17:13.058
[FAKE ZORO]
Uh! No, it can't be!

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:15.894
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

00:17:15.927 --> 00:17:17.962
That's the real deal

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:19.664
Tony Tony Chopper!

00:17:19.697 --> 00:17:20.832
The pet's comin' home!

00:17:20.865 --> 00:17:23.401
So we all look a little
different than we used to,

00:17:23.435 --> 00:17:24.702
who cares?

00:17:24.736 --> 00:17:26.971
He must've been abandoned
on this island when they died

00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:29.741
and has been living
in the wild ever since.

00:17:29.774 --> 00:17:31.376
And now he's following us around

00:17:31.409 --> 00:17:34.312
because he thinks his masters
have finally come back for him.

00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:37.215
We should ditch the mutt
and take him instead.

00:17:37.248 --> 00:17:38.817
If we have their real pet,

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.519
no one will ever doubt that
we're the Straw Hats again!

00:17:41.553 --> 00:17:43.088
Sounds good. What's he eat?

00:17:43.121 --> 00:17:44.355
[FAKE SANJI]
Probably cotton candy.

00:17:44.389 --> 00:17:45.590
We ain't got none o' that!

You're kinda freaking me out!

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.775
[BLACK SUIT MAN A]
Now!

00:18:03.808 --> 00:18:04.809
[FAKE ROBIN]
Huh?

00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:07.679
[CHOPPER]
Robin!

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:09.848
Hey! Stop! Come back!

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:11.015
Who were those creeps?

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:13.551
Oh, no! This is
a real emergency!

00:18:13.585 --> 00:18:15.353
What're we gonna do now?

00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:17.789
I guess we should tell
Captain Luffy, right?

00:18:17.822 --> 00:18:19.924
Maybe he knows how
to handle this mess.

00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.894
Wait! I didn't know Luffy was
back on the island already!

00:18:22.927 --> 00:18:25.630
You're right. And he'll
have new recruits by now.

00:18:25.663 --> 00:18:26.698
That's great!

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:29.033
With the extra might,
we'll save Robin for sure!

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:30.535
Let's go get our friend back!

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:31.703
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:33.371
[BOTH chuckle]

00:18:33.404 --> 00:18:34.873
[BLACK SUIT MAN A]
Calling from Sabaody!

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:36.407
We've secured Nico Robin!

00:18:36.441 --> 00:18:40.078
We've also caught some fox thing
that won't stop biting her head.

00:18:42.514 --> 00:18:45.216
I shouldn't be worried
if Franky is so fired up.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.451
The Sunny will be just fine

00:18:46.484 --> 00:18:49.254
until I make my way back
with all of the, uh...

00:18:49.287 --> 00:18:50.455
Ah!

00:18:50.488 --> 00:18:52.590
Viva Sabaody!

00:18:52.624 --> 00:18:54.058
Ah!

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:55.493
Gotta stay focused, Sanji.

00:18:55.527 --> 00:18:58.096
Your first priority is finding
the best ingredients you can

00:18:58.129 --> 00:18:59.230
for the crew's meals.

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:01.499
Oh, boy! Beautiful!

00:19:01.533 --> 00:19:04.002
I've been needing a lady
just like you in my life!

00:19:04.035 --> 00:19:05.470
And once the pantry is stocked,

00:19:05.503 --> 00:19:09.107
I'll make something really
special for both Robin and Nami.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.609
The only problem is,

00:19:11.643 --> 00:19:14.579
nothing in this market
is really standing out.

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:16.281
What should I do?

00:19:20.051 --> 00:19:22.120
Gotcha. That's a tough spot.

00:19:22.153 --> 00:19:26.324
But your best bet is the shop
on the beach. In Grove 42.

00:19:27.492 --> 00:19:29.961
[SANJI]
Thank you! I'll head there now!

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:36.301
Yo! Fisherman, you in?

00:19:36.334 --> 00:19:38.870
Lookin' for some good
stock at a low price.

00:19:38.903 --> 00:19:40.471
Huh? This the place?

00:19:40.505 --> 00:19:42.340
[OLD FISHERMAN A whimpering]

00:19:42.373 --> 00:19:43.274
[SANJI]
Hm?

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:45.143
Hey, you run this shack?

00:19:46.878 --> 00:19:47.879
What's the matter?

00:19:47.912 --> 00:19:50.148
It's something awful!

00:19:50.181 --> 00:19:52.283
That green-haired man's gone!

00:19:52.317 --> 00:19:55.019
Aw, crap. All right,
old man, spill it.

00:19:55.053 --> 00:19:57.522
I can't believe this
has happened to me!

00:19:57.555 --> 00:20:00.625
Well, y'see, uh...

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:03.194
[ZORO] Hey, gramps. I was
lookin' to do some fishing.

00:20:03.228 --> 00:20:04.162
Huh?

00:20:04.195 --> 00:20:05.496
No offense, young man,

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.067
but I wouldn't exactly peg
you as the fishing type.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.668
[ZORO]
Normally you'd be right.

00:20:10.702 --> 00:20:13.004
I'm supposed to be meeting
some friends on this island,

00:20:13.037 --> 00:20:16.474
but they haven't made it yet,
so I'm bored outta my skull.

00:20:16.507 --> 00:20:20.044
So I need something to keep
me entertained while I wait.

00:20:20.078 --> 00:20:22.080
You think you can
help me out, or not?

00:20:22.113 --> 00:20:24.649
Sure. I'll finish getting
everything we need ready,

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:27.018
and then meet you on my
boat right over there.

00:20:28.386 --> 00:20:30.655
And that's all I said to him.

00:20:30.688 --> 00:20:33.091
To be clear, did this
guy have three swords

00:20:33.124 --> 00:20:34.325
and a belly warmer?

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:37.495
Yes, he did! And he had a
deep scar on his eye, too!

00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:38.830
How'd ya know?

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.199
Scar's new.

00:20:41.232 --> 00:20:42.500
Is this him?

00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:43.601
Yeah!

00:20:43.635 --> 00:20:45.370
He said he'd been waiting
on some friends to show.

00:20:45.403 --> 00:20:46.537
That must be you.

00:20:46.571 --> 00:20:49.007
[SANJI]
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.509
Y'see, I told him to
wait on my fishing boat

00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:54.178
while I was getting ready, and
I pointed right at the thing,

00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:57.282
but when I came outside,
he'd made a huge mistake!

00:20:57.315 --> 00:20:59.884
No! Young man!

00:20:59.917 --> 00:21:03.221
You've got it wrong!
You're on a pirate ship!

00:21:03.254 --> 00:21:05.023
Now, men, it's time we set sail

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.025
for the New World we've
been dreaming of!

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:08.192
The wait is over!

00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:09.027
[PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.262
Come on, please!
You have to wake up!

00:21:11.296 --> 00:21:13.398
You got on the wrong ship!

00:21:14.432 --> 00:21:16.634
[OLD FISHERMAN A]
Since they went underwater,

00:21:16.668 --> 00:21:20.238
I'd guess there were headed
to Fishman Island.

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:25.910
That idiot!

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:33.284
[SANJI] Should've known him
showing up here first

00:21:33.318 --> 00:21:34.952
was too good to be true.

00:21:34.986 --> 00:21:37.789
Wouldn't be Zoro if he didn't
get lost somewhere.

00:21:37.822 --> 00:21:39.223
Aren't you worried at all?

00:21:39.257 --> 00:21:40.725
They might kill him
on that ship!

00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:42.660
It's fine, don't get worked up.

00:21:42.694 --> 00:21:45.330
This is pretty standard
fare, actually.

00:21:45.363 --> 00:21:46.431
Better than usual, even,

00:21:46.464 --> 00:21:48.466
since we know where
he's going for once.

00:21:48.499 --> 00:21:50.635
Now, would you mind selling
me some fish already?

00:21:50.668 --> 00:21:52.103
I don't think you understand.

00:21:52.136 --> 00:21:52.737
[MEN chattering]

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.172
[MAN N]
Whoa! See that?

00:21:54.205 --> 00:21:54.906
[SANJI]
Hm?

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:56.007
[OLD FISHERMAN A]
Huh?

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.576
[MAN II] Look at the waves!
Somethin's coming up!

00:21:58.609 --> 00:21:59.677
[SANJI]
Hm?

00:22:02.313 --> 00:22:03.614
[MAN JJ]
But what?

00:22:03.648 --> 00:22:05.783
[MAN KK]
It must be huge!

00:22:08.486 --> 00:22:10.021
[MEN gasp]

00:22:14.692 --> 00:22:16.294
[MEN]
Whoa!

00:22:17.228 --> 00:22:19.163
[MAN LL]
That's a galleon ship!

00:22:19.197 --> 00:22:20.631
[MAN O]
It must've had poor coating

00:22:20.665 --> 00:22:22.266
and was crushed under
the water pressure!

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.202
No, it has to be the
work of Sea Kings!

00:22:24.235 --> 00:22:25.937
[MAN MM] But it looks like
it's been cut in half.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:27.839
Like someone attacked it!

00:22:27.872 --> 00:22:30.174
No way! Just think for a second!

00:22:30.208 --> 00:22:31.342
Who in the world could do that?

00:22:31.376 --> 00:22:33.111
Damn you! Tell me why!

00:22:33.144 --> 00:22:34.679
How could you just
ruin our dreams

00:22:34.712 --> 00:22:37.148
of reaching the New
World like this?

00:22:38.716 --> 00:22:40.318
[ZORO]
Call it a twist of fate.

00:22:40.351 --> 00:22:42.820
That's what brought this
plague upon your ship.

00:22:42.854 --> 00:22:45.957
And there's no one for you
to blame but yourselves.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.126
Are you kidding me?

00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:48.993
[MAN P]
Look!

00:22:49.026 --> 00:22:50.294
Who the heck is that guy?

00:22:50.328 --> 00:22:52.797
Oh, great. Back already...

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.999
...and he's still a
pain in the ass.

00:23:03.174 --> 00:23:08.012
That... wasn't my ride.

00:23:15.353 --> 00:23:17.188
[NARRATOR] One by one,
the Straw Hats reunite

00:23:17.221 --> 00:23:18.990
as they prepare to depart
for the New World

00:23:19.023 --> 00:23:20.825
as soon as possible.

00:23:20.858 --> 00:23:23.161
However, Sentomaru and
the Navy have yet again

00:23:23.194 --> 00:23:25.029
amassed a team of Pacifistas,

00:23:25.062 --> 00:23:26.697
threatening to repear
the same tragedy

00:23:26.731 --> 00:23:29.567
that drove the crew from
Sabaody two years ago.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.669
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.702 --> 00:23:35.673
"The Navy Has Set Out!
The Straw Hats in Danger!"

00:23:35.706 --> 00:23:38.142
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
