00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,658
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,327
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,497
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,500
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,294
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body

42
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,796
turned to rubber body after
eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,799
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,427
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,262
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,389
of the World Government,
which will use

47
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,850
any means necessary
to stop them.

48
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,520
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

49
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,773
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

50
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,943
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

51
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:18,656
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

52
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,620
[NARRATOR] After the
Straw Hat crew rescued Camie

53
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,706
from being sold at an auction
house, they unexpectedly

54
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,376
met Rayleigh, the craftsman
they'd been searching for.

55
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,878
He revealed...

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,464
[RAYLEIGH] See, the Captain
turned himself in.

57
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,216
[ALL gasp]

58
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,554
While they may execute
me, I won't die.

59
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:46,684
If anyone wants my treasure,
then it's yours for the taking!

60
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,603
Go find it!

61
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,606
I left everything I
gathered in one place.

62
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,025
Well, in that case,
let me ask you:

63
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,320
Do you think you can do it?
The New World far surpasses

64
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,823
anything you can imagine.
Your foes will be powerful.

65
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:05,411
Knowing that, do you still think
you can rule this mighty sea?

66
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,705
What? I don't wanna
"rule" anything.

67
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,666
Being King of the Pirates
is about being

68
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,293
more free than anyone!

69
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,003
I see.

70
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,508
[LUFFY]
No Escape?

71
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,969
Admiral Kizaru's
Light Speed Kick!

72
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,602
Be careful!

73
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,772
Yeah! Take care of yourselves!

74
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,564
[SHAKKY laughs]

75
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,817
[USOPP]
We will! You do the same!

76
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,568
[CHOPPER]
Tell Hachi goodbye!

77
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,322
[ALL shouting]

78
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:45,618
Isn't this a bit much?
It's only 3 days.

79
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,829
That doesn't matter.
Goodbyes are always difficult.

80
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,665
See ya!

81
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,543
Well. I suppose I
should be off, too.

82
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,795
[LUFFY]
We're counting on you!

83
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,803
[FRANKY] It's been a whirlwind
ever since we got here,

84
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:07,098
but I wasn't expecting to run
into Roger's Vice-Captain.

85
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,474
I'm kinda stunned.

86
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,559
[USOPP]
Huh?

87
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,352
[FRANKY]
I mean, what are the odds?

88
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,396
He's a pretty intimidating
guy for an old geezer.

89
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,356
I'll give him that much.

90
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,942
Well, he is the most famous
man in Roger's crew,

91
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,737
and deservedly so, it seems.

92
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:24,073
So that's what crewmen on the
Oro Jackson were like, huh?

93
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,451
[TOM] Giving a hand to that
Roger guy is something

94
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,660
I'll never forget.

95
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:32,540
In fact, it's something
I take great pride in!

96
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,667
Man, I'm glad I
got to meet him.

97
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,669
[USOPP] You know, I never
would've pegged you

98
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,047
for someone who had such
reverence for your elders.

99
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,424
[FRANKY] Yeah? Well,
sometimes I do, okay?

100
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,508
Now shut the hell up!

101
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,718
[LUFFY] Hey!
[FRANKY, USOPP] Huh?

102
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,346
[LUFFY]
I've got an idea.

103
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,348
Let's go to the amusement park!

104
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,433
[FRANKY, USOPP]
Bad idea!

105
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,976
[FRANKY] Do you even
get what's happening?

106
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,021
[USOPP] You still haven't
learned your lesson, have you?

107
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,606
[CHOPPER, BROOK]
Sounds like fun.

108
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,900
[FRANKY, USOPP]
Not you, too?

00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,446
[PIRATE 401A]
It's Admiral Kizaru!

00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,031
We've gotta get
the hell outta here!

112
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,617

Don't let those pirates escape!

There are wanted men everywhere
on this archipelago!

115

worth over 100 million!

This is Admiral Kizaru.

119
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,635
Hm. That's odd.

120
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:30,723
Hello?

121
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,059
Well, that's awful strange.

[PIRATE 401B]
Crap! We're screwed now!

123

No, hold on, there's
still a chance.

124
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,066
I think I can get the drop
on him and take him down

125
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,443
from here, and if I do,
I'll be famous!

126
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,862
Huh? Are you out
of your damn mind?

127
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,406

What the hell? I know I
didn't miss him that time!

The bullet passed
right through his head!

00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,025
So terribly odd.

He's obviously got some kind
of crazy Devil Fruit powers!

work on him! Run for it!

if you could help me out.

00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,426
Oh, good.

346
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,887
It looks like someone else
decided to join the fight!

347
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,722
Is that...

348
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,268
[HAWKINS PIRATE 392A] "Red Flag"
Diez Drake! Why's he here?

349
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,104
Is that the extent of
your power, Mad Monk?

350
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,606
[UROUGE]
Aw, it's you again.

351
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,275
[KIZARU]
Rear Admiral Drake.

352
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:15,070
Aw, crap! I hadn't planned
on running into Kizaru!

353
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:20,159
[UROUGE yelling]

354
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,201
Ooh...

355
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,746
[UROUGE grunting]

356
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,377
[UROUGE] I've taken quite
a beating, but let's see

357
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,881
if Hawkins' prediction
is true or not.

358
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,675
There might be some
hope for me yet.

359
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,138
Let's start this
over nice and slow.

360
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,307
[APOO whimpers]
Look at this!

361
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,935
This is insane! Unbelievable!
I'm having a blast here!

362
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,189
You're insane! Whoever
stays here is gonna die!

363
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,357
This is our chance to escape!

364
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,693
Aw, you're no fun!

365
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,696
We're here to party, and
that's Captain's orders.

366
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,244
Who the heck are you?

367
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,497
[USOPP]
Get back, Luffy!

368
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,917
[NAMI] He's one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea!

369
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,420
He is? How do you
guys know that?

370
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,759
Luffy! Don't let that attack
hit you! It's a shockwave!

371
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,052
[LUFFY gasps]

372
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,392
Damn!

373
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,019
[NAMI] What is this?
[USOPP] Great!

374
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,855
[USOPP]
So he can do this crap too?

375
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,858
Hey! You lied! That
wasn't a shockwave!

376
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,276
That was...

377
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,820
[BOTH]
...a beam!

378
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,823
You're gonna be impressed
straight to your grave!

379
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,496
Bartholomew Kuma!
Why are you here?

380
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,997
That bastard.

381
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,791
Hey, I remember him now.

382
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,210
He's the guy that showed up
at Thriller Bark I never fought!

383
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,087
That's right!
The very same!

384
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,297
Things got pretty dicey when
he started shooting at us

385
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,216
with shockwaves from
the paws on his hands.

386
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,261
We barely made it out alive!

387
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,388
The fact that we are
still alive is probably

388
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,181
the reason he came back.

389
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,064
In other words,
we got lucky last time,

390
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,275
but he's here to finish the job.

391
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,318
[FRANKY] Sure, that's
one way to look at it.

392
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,321
But I call this payback time!

393
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,198
Coup de...

394
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,783
...vent!

395
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,748
You got him!

396
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,375
Not exactly.

397
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,836
[FRANKY]
He's down, but he ain't out.

398
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,008
[BROOK gasps]
Luffy!

399
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,011
[LUFFY]
All right. Second Gear!

400
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,179
We know he's
strong, no question.

401
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,515
So let's go all-out
from the start!

402
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,266
[NAMI grunts]

403
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,435
[USOPP grunts]
[CHOPPER grunts]

404
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,812
[BROOK grunts]
[ROBIN grunts]

405
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,355
I'll be on the boat.

406
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,149
[ZORO grunts]

407
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,986
[ZORO]
Something's off here.

408
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,822
He seems different from
the last time we met.

409
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,955
[ZORO]
Or am I crazy?

410
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,547
Let's go!

411
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,092
[ALL yelling]

412
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:31,975
[PIRATES clamoring]

413
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,602
[SENTOMARU]
What's taking so long?

414
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,480
The warship should
have been here by now!

415
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,319
[SENTOMARU] Why hasn't
Uncle Kizaru contacted me yet?

416
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,827
[SENTOMARU]
It's chaos already.

417
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,874
He'd better hurry.

418
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,585
[LUFFY yelling]

419
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,843
Or there won't be
any rookies left.

420
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,887
Not at this rate.

421
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,478
[LUFFY] You met this
Warlord guy before,

422
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,938
but this time he's different?

423
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,107
[ZORO] Yeah. The real
one had different powers

424
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,858
and he was a lot
more talkative.

425
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,402
[SANJI] That's not
what I want to hear.

426
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,029
This guy's damn near invincible
and you're telling me

427
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,114
there's two of him?

428
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,990
[LUFFY]
Wait, so this one's a fake?

429
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,867
On the next One Piece.

430
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,910
"Overwhelming!

431
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,955
The Navy's Fighting
Weapons, the Pacifistas."

432
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,165
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
