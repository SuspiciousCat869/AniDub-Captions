00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,590
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,227
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,929
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,965
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,399
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,169
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,737
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,907
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,743
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,279
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,946
of the World Government,

12
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,917
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,519
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,756
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,026
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,831
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,037
[NARRATOR] Luffy grieved over
the loss of his brother, Ace,

18
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,073
in the War of the Best
against the Navy.

19
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,909
After recovering thanks
to Jimbei's encouragement,

20
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,013
he met with Dark King Rayleigh.

21
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,415
Well, then, that's it.

22
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:38,952
If you think I should,
I'll go back... to Marineford!

23
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,420
[NARRATOR]
One by one,

24
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,657
the rest of the Straw Hats
learned of the big news.

25
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,927
No way! I don't believe it!

26
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,428
Luffy!

27
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,829
[gasps] Luffy!

28
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,700
Oh, good. He's safe.

29
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,502
[SANJI]
It's in today's paper?

30
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,237
[gasps] Whoa!

31
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:05,212
[LUFFY] "Unexpected Relanding!
Luffy, to Marineford!"

32
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,918
[NARRATOR] At Navy Headquarters,
located on the Grand Line.

33
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,357
[BRANDNEW]
It's incomprehensible!

34
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,059
During the War of the Best,
it was revealed that Straw Hat

35
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,528
is the late Portgas
D. Ace's adopted brother,

36
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,898
on top of also being the son
of the Revolutionary, Dragon.

37
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,400
Which would make
him the grandson

38
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,703
of our own Vice Admiral Garp,
if you're paying attention!

39
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,737
So, tell me,

40
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,340
how did all of
this slip past us?

41
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,409
After the war, he went missing,

42
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,412
but lo and behold,
he was alive, as we expected.

43
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,814
Now, after everything
that's happened,

44
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,516
he has the gall to come
to Marineford again!

45
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,053
[NARRATOR]
A few days ago...

46
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,702
The damage is unreal!

47
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,403
[REPORTER A]
What did you expect?

48
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,405
It was an all-out war
between the Navy elite

49
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,974
and the world's greatest pirate.

50
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,543
It's a miracle that the island
is still standing, isn't it?

51
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,345
So, what brings you out
to this pile of rubble?

52
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,980
A story, of course!

53
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:16,250
I came from Alabasta to cover
Crocodile and Straw Hat.

54
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:19,487
Though, supposedly, Straw Hat
could already be dead.

55
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,422
I'm sure the Navy wants
you to think that,

56
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:22,890
but right now there's
no way of knowing,

57
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,992
what with everything
else that's going on.

58
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,927
I mean, look at what
they're dealing with here.

59
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,729
[REPORTER F]
That's true.

60
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,499
[WHITEBEARD]
The One Piece!

61
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:35,502
The One Piece is real!

62
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,004
[REPORTER F]
With his dying words,

63
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:40,307
Whitebeard inspired pirates
all over the world.

64
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,477
They're committing crimes
more often than before.

65
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,213
Every able-bodied
Navy soldier available

66
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:49,583
has to deal with the
increase in pirate activity.

67
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,352
Well, how unfortunate for them!

68
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:53,720
Huh?

69
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:57,090
Speaking of which, here come
some Navy soldiers now.

70
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:04,265
Huh?

71
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,466
What's wrong with them?

72
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,801
How come they're still out
there instead of docking?

73
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,904
Hey! The ship is acting funny.

No, sir!

He came back! But why?

Is that kid out of his mind?

82
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,723
Who came back?

Uh-oh. This could get ugly, men.

It still hasn't come
any closer to the shore.

the island once.

It's like a funeral at sea!

It's a taunt. Without
our main forces here,

can bury us alive.

Are they forming an alliance?

140
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,696
Rayleigh used to be a crew
member of Gold Roger's.

141

Could Straw Hat be
Roger's successor?

Straw Hat may be Ace's brother,
but he's not Gold Roger's son.

This whole thing is weird.

Wow, no matter how you spin it,

this story's gonna be huge!

This article's already
been circulated

147

throughout the entire world!

148
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,899
Those journalists are so
starved for attention,

149
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,368
they even mentioned
how Straw Hat escaped!

150
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:43,303
This is humiliating!

151
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,906
If we take this appearance
of his at face value,

152
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,641
all Straw Hat did
was pay tribute

153
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,210
to his brother Ace, Whitebeard,
and all the other people

154
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:52,012
who died in the war.

155
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,348
The moment of silence
and trip around Marineford

156
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:55,749
support that notion,

157
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:58,719
but he rung the bell
not twice, as is customary,

158
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:01,121
but a whopping 16 times!

159
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,589
Sixteen bell tolls!

160
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,592
There's no doubt in my mind
that this is a challenge to us!

161
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,896
Oh, honestly! For such a rookie,

162
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,365
this Straw Hat Luffy
is certainly controversial.

163
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,367
But the boy is Garp's grandson,

164
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,669
so I suppose I shouldn't
be surprised.

165
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:19,372
I'm curious as to how he
and Rayleigh know each other.

166
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:23,077
I highly doubt Rayleigh
intended to rejoin the fray.

167
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,679
A pity Jimbei decided
to turn against us.

168
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:27,548
His allegiance to
the World Government

169
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:31,151
as a Warlord acted as
a symbol of intertribal peace.

170
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,987
It's disappointing to lose him.

171
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,154
Thanks to this turmoil,

172
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,824
the Three Great Powers
are completely unbalanced.

173
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,392
Also, how should we take care of

174
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,861

the Seven Warlords?

175
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:44,030

will unfold in the New World.

00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,266
Relationships and
hierarchies among pirates

177
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,501
are sure to change.

178
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,737
We must take great care
in ensuring we pick

179
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,572
the most powerful ones.

180
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,006
[ELDER STAR D]
Blackbeard already made

181
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,342
his first move in
the New World, by the way.

182
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:57,211
He knocked off
a promising rookie--

183
00:12:57,244 --> 00:13:00,881
one that had a bounty of
over 100,000,000 berries.

184
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:03,150
[ELDER STAR A] And thanks
to his time with Whitebeard,

185
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,886
he knows all about
the old man's territory.

186
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,723
[ELDER STAR E] He certainly
has a lead over any other pirate

187
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,392
who's aiming to become
one of the Four Emperors.

188
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,728
[ELDER STAR E]
No one else in history

189
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,864
has ever eaten two Devil Fruits,

190
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:19,566
yet he seems to have
absorbed Whitebeard's.

191
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,468
[ELDER STAR B] The only ones
with the power to stop him

192
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:23,437
are other Emperors.

193
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,007
Actually, perhaps
Marco the Phoenix

194
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,375
and the other
Whitebeard survivors

195
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,210
have a small chance as well.

196
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,114
It's always the D's who
stir up the most trouble.

197
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:37,685
First Roger, then Portgas,
and now, with Monkey D. Luffy,

198
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:39,620
those names are
exposed to the public

199
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,588
far more than they should be.

200
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,776
[KONG]
I tried to talk him out of it,

201
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:06,313
but as far as we're concerned,
Garp is practically retired.

202
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,283
[KONG] Though he does
technically hold his title,

203
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,785
so he's still a Navy officer.

204
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:15,723
We need him to stay onboard
to train our young soldiers.

205
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:19,627
If you intend to resign from
your position as fleet admiral,

206
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,729
could you at least
do that for us as well,

207
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,597
Sengoku?

208
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,267
Yes, sir. I can
accept that offer.

209
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:31,072
It's not the worst way
to spend retired life.

210
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:33,073
[sighs]

211
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,442
[KONG] The two central
figures who have led the Navy

212
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:38,412
since Roger's era are
finally stepping down.

213
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,581
This will make
quite a splash I fear.

214
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:43,117
Needless to say,
you'll be missed.

215
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,752
Including the prisoners
that were set free

216
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:47,922
from the sixth level
of Impel Down,

217
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:51,224
there's still a mess of
dangerous pirates on the loose.

218
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:54,628
[SENGOKU]
Before his death,

219
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:57,597
Newgate was at
the top of the list.

220
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,802
[SENGOKU] The Great Pirate Era
is in a period of transition.

221
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:06,339
Old Navy officers shouldn't
keep clinging to power.

222
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:10,577
The basis for justice
changes from era to era.

223
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,748
It sounds like you're
ready to step down.

224
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:18,719
Oh, Kong, while I'm here,
I would like to recommend Aokiji

225
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,054
to take my place as
the next fleet admiral.

226
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,389
He'd do a fine job.

227
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:25,058
[sneezes]

228
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:29,897
[COBY panting]

229
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,631
[FISHBONEN]
They call this power "Haki."

230
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,202
[FISHBONEN] I'm certain
that's what you've got.

231
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,938
[FISHBONEN] Perhaps it
was awakened by the trauma

232
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,107
you experienced during the war.

233
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,076
Normally, the only way you
can obtain the power of Haki

234
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,179
is through vigorous training.

235
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:48,181
Haki? Are you sure, Doc?

236
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,516
You're pretty lucky, kid!

237
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,618
It's the same power
that the Navy vice admirals

238
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:52,686
have in their possession.

239
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,520
Really?

240
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,789
[COBY whimpers]

241
00:15:55,823 --> 00:16:00,660
[MARINES chattering]

242
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,437
[COBY] I can feel all those
people echoing in my head.

243
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,238
I can't make it stop!

244
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:14,208
You two are apprentices
to Vice Admiral Garp, right?

245
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,676
Ask him about it.

246
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,278
Hey, Doctor!

247
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,713
You think I might
pick up some Haki, too?

248
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,215
I doubt it.

249
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:22,115
[HELMEPPO grunts]

250
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:22,950
[COBY chuckles]

251
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,685
It's not fair! Damn it!

252
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:25,953
We were partners

253
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,288
and all of a sudden
you're way cooler than me!

254
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,258
I don't know how
to feel about all this.

255
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:34,561
[COBY] But I do know
how I feel--weird!

256
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:37,197
It's like I'm a completely
different person!

257
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,367
But if this thing that
happened to me really is Haki,

258
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,403
I might be able to
use it to get stronger.

259
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,672
Much stronger than
I am right now.

260
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:49,409
Maybe even as strong as him,
for real this time.

261
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:54,581
I'm sorry, Admiral Aokiji!
We couldn't hold the fort!

262
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,716
--[AOKIJI] Huh?
--[MARINE B cries]

263
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,151
[AOKIJI]
Uh...

264
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:00,854
[AOKIJI]
It's fine.

265
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:01,855
Huh?

266
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,863
[AOKIJI]
Alive after all.

267
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,731
Would you look at that!

268
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:13,700
You hear about Straw Hat
going back to Marineford?

269
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:14,668
Crazy kid.

270
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,103
Yeah.

271
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,672
The War of the Best is still
fresh in everyone's minds,

272
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,575
and now Straw Hat
rings the bell 16 times.

273
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,277
Is he trying to send some
kind of message or what?

274
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,414
[SMOKER]
Beats me.

275
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:30,350
Anyway, did you ask
them about my transfer?

276
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,187
Not yet, but I'll be sure
to bring it up with Sengoku

277
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,688
when I have the chance.

278
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,190
Are you serious about this?

279
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,358
Not really the sort of thing

280
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,459
somebody would make
a joke about, is it?

281
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,395
[AOKIJI]
No, especially not you,

282
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:45,732
but either way, people aren't
exactly clamoring to join G-5.

283
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,834
I'm sure you've
heard the stories.

284
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,936
It's not pretty.

285
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,107
So, transferring to the fifth
branch on the Grand Line, huh?

286
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:57,744
The New World. You realize
how wild things get over there.

287
00:17:57,778 --> 00:18:01,715
[SMOKER] For me, it's better,
to be closer to my target.

288
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,153
[NARRATOR]
The news about Straw Hat Luffy

289
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,922
quickly spread through
countless waters.

290
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,960
[NARRATOR] Word even
spread to the New World.

291
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:14,461
Straw Hat Luffy.

292
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:16,963
Turns out the
punk is still alive!

293
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:20,968
"He rang the bell 16 times to
mark a new era in Marineford."

294
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,570
So, what the hell
is this Ox Bell thing?

295
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,207
[KILLER]
A relic, you might say.

296
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,044
It's a sacred bell
from the Ox Lloyd,

297
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:34,381
a Navy warship that was quite
impressive back in its day.

298
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:37,485
At year's end, they ring
the bell eight times to signify

299
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:40,120
the passing year,
then eight more times

300
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:43,123
as a sort of good omen
for the coming year.

301
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:45,926
So, that's the
meaning of 16 rings.

302
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,961
Some crusty old Navy custom.

303
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,997
Nothing special.

304
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,565
[KID]
Heh.

305
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,500
[KILLER] But since
the year hasn't ended yet,

306
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,235
maybe Straw Hat
did it to announce

307
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:58,272
the end and beginning
of a new pirate era.

308
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,941
He came outta
Marineford pretty cocky.

309
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,142
Whitebeard's era is over

310
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,945
and he's acting like he's
in charge of the next one.

311
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,880
Let the brat do what he wants.

312
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,982
Everyone knows his
brother's death hit him hard,

313
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,617
so he's gotta make
a good showing

314
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,953
before people
think he's washed up.

315
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,788
[KID chuckles]

316
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,957
He's gonna be a real
pain in the ass!

317
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,325
His bounty's through the roof

318
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:21,562
and it's only going up if he
keeps pulling stunts like this.

319
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:24,331
Well, that's his plan, I'm sure.

320
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,399
Too bad!

321
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,134
I'm gonna teach him the hard way

322
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,903
that he can't do whatever
he wants! Not here!

323
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,107
[KID]
The New World.

324
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:37,544
From how they talk place up,
I thought it'd be more fun.

00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,212
Not full of cowards like you.

326
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:40,914
What's the big idea, huh?

327
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:44,117
Untie us right now! We didn't
cause you any harm, did we?

328
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:47,088
This place is a living hell,
we were trying to sail away!

329
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:50,090
Please let us go back
to Paradise alive!

330
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:51,424
Paradise, ah?

331
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,627
Do you mean your boring
home that's pirate-free?

332
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,995
You just got here,

333
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:57,431
so you don't know how
horrible this sea really is!

334
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:59,766
Free us and leave while you can!

335
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,108
Straw Hat, huh?

00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,911
Yes, Faddah. He's cookin'
somethin' up again.

337
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:13,147
No need to bother
over that fool.

338
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,915
If he keeps playing
his cards so early,

339
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,917
he'll burn out before
the end of the game.

00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,962
What's goin' on?
How's this possible?

346
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:30,897
Control the ship, damn it!

347
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:33,400
Look, Faddah! Something
is coming down from the sky!

348
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:34,235
[gasps]

349
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:36,437
[FIRETANK PIRATES gasp]

350
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,105
[FIRETANK PIRATE A]
It's not comin' down.

351
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:39,740
We're goin' up!

352
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:43,310
[FIRETANK PIRATES screaming]

353
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:48,181
[HAWKINS]
Wait, who are you?

354
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,985
I'm sorry, could
you say that again?

355
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:54,755
I wasn't really
listening to you.

356
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,223
I'm Brownbeard!

357
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,727
There's a bounty of over
80,000,000 berries on my head!

358
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,895
Are you listening now?

359
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:05,933
This is my territory, so when
you hear my name, you bow!

360
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:09,069
You think you can sit your ass
on my men and get away with it?

361
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,739
You gotta pay for that
with your own blood!

362
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:14,475
[HAWKINS] I see. I thought
I had misheard you,

363
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:16,743
because it's such a stupid name.

364
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,545
I'll tell you two things.

365
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:21,248
Number one is I do not
appreciate your jokes.

366
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,783
Is that so?

367
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,751
[HAWKINS]
As for number two...

368
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:27,955
[HAWKINS]
...I can see the shadow of death

369
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:31,125
crawling upon your face.

370
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:31,959
[gasps]

371
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:35,629
[BROWNBEARD PIRATES gasping]

372
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:40,066
[UROUGE]
And you're absolutely certain

373
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,036
that's the island the
Log Pose is pointing to?

374
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,805
Just look at it!

375
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:47,040
It's raining lightning!

376
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:48,909
This isn't going to work.

377
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:52,046
[FALLEN MONK PIRATES gasp]

378
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,281
Uhh...

379
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:57,250
How the hell do
we get to the shore?

380
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,021
[NARRATOR] There is
a realization that comes

381
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:03,490
to all men who set foot
in the New World.

382
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:06,426
[FALLEN MONK PIRATE A] High
Priest! Somebody is approaching!

383
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:09,129
[UROUGE]
Huh? Who goes there?

384
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,164
[NARRATOR] All their
struggles in the first half

385
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:13,601
of the Grand Line
suddenly seem petty.

386
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:16,436
Is that a young man
waiting to greet me?

387
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,939
What do you want
from us, old lady?

388
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:21,108
[NARRATOR]
Because compared to this,

389
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:23,443
those waters were like paradise.

390
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,782
Would you like an umbrella
for your journey?

391
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:31,218
[PIRATE A] I'm telling you,
if we stay here, we'll be dead!

392
00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:32,986
Every last one of us!

393
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,554
Let us sail back to paradise!

394
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:37,290
I promise we won't get
in your way! I beg you!

395
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:40,160
Man, this guy's
a real wet blanket.

396
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,398
Didn't you choose
the life of a pirate?

397
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:46,133
If you're not prepared
to die for that...

398
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,601
[gasps]

399
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:50,804
...maybe you should've stayed
away from the New World!

400
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,573
[KID yells]

401
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:55,076
[screams]

402
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:56,577
[thud]

403
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,379
You wanna throw down
the gauntlet, Straw Hat,

404
00:22:58,412 --> 00:22:59,946
that's fine!

405
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,317
But don't cry when I come for
you, 'cause it won't be pretty!

406
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,087
[KID cackles]

407
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:16,163
[NARRATOR] Luffy's latest
incident in Marineford

408
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:18,231
quickly becomes worldwide news.

409
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:20,134
Although his
exploit was a sucess,

410
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:23,637
it seems to cause little but
bewilderment to all who hear it.

411
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,906
His strange message
has met its target,

412
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:28,708
but will his friends understand
the next stage of his plan?

413
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,544
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

414
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:32,779
"With Hopes it Will
Reach My Friends!

415
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:34,715
Big News Spreading Fast!"

416
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,417
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
