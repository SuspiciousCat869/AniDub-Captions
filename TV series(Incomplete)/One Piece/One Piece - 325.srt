00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:37,290
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:41,228
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,464
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:49,636
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,805
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,173
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:56,310
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,846
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,483
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,452
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:09,122
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,000
[DRAGON] Follow your own
beliefs to the end, Luffy.

13
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,403
With a will such as
yours and a little luck,

14
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:26,073
the masses may learn to
question this world, after all.

15
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,274
[DRAGON] Ride the winds
of change, my son.

16
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:32,312
That day you and I meet will
come soon enough, I'm sure.

17
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,351
[ZEFF] Enies Lobby is the
gateway to the World Government.

18
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,086
Once you've gone
knocking on that door,

19
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,455
I'm afraid there's
no turning back.

20
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,124
[ZEFF] You can bet your life
that pirates and Marines alike

21
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,493
have got their blood
boiling over this mess.

22
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,895
It won't be long before
everyone in the world will know

23
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,632
the names of the
Straw Hat Pirates.

24
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,500
[ZEFF] Their faces,
on the other hand...

25
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,003
[raucous laughter]

26
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,838
[PATTY]
Lookin' good there, Sanji!

27
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,040
[PATTY laughing]

28
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,308
[CARNE] This is one
of our former chefs!

29
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,785
[TEACH]
Zehahahaha!

30
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,753
[TEACH]
That crazy bastard!

31
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,458
Get a load of this!
It's about Straw Hat!

32
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,759
He and his crew
went wild on Enies Lobby.

33
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,796
His bounty should go through
the roof after that one!

34
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,567
That's next to Water 7, yes?

35
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,269
I wonder if they hijacked
a sea train to get there.

36
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,106
That island
isn't far from here.

37
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,742
At this rate,
we might meet them again.

38
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:38,578
If fate is kind enough
to place them in our sights,

39
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,649
we're obligated to pull
the trigger, aren't we?

40
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:42,682
[coughs]

41
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,787
Wiiihahahaha!

42
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,156
What're we waiting for?

43
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,925
Nothing. Let's go!

44
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,094
Zehahahaha!

45
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,397
[TEACH] We'd better cut
them off before they leave,

46
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,399
or before the Navy
gets to 'em first.

47
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,435
[ACE] Hey. Hold on
a second there, Teach.

48
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,736
We need to talk.

49
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,770
[TEACH] Huh?

50
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,046
[NARRATOR] Three days
before the Straw Hat Pirates'

51
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,048
new bounties shocked the world,

52
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,585
another history-changing
event was about to occur

53
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,219
not far from Water 7.

54
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,288
[NARRATOR]
This is Banero Island,

55
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,157
a small settlement that will
soon be turned upside down

56
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,294
in a duel between
fire and shadow.

57
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,164
[LUFFY] The Most Heinous Power!

58
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:34,201
Blackbeard's
Darkness Attacks Ace!

59
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:48,448
Oh! What d'you know!

60
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,117
It's Commander Ace!

61
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:52,686
[ACE] You have no right
to call me that anymore.

62
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,556
Use that title with respect,
or don't use it at all.

63
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,292
I won't have you mock me.

64
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:02,196
[LAFITTE] Ooh! So this is
the famous "Fire Fist Ace."

65
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,797
[ACE] Yep, that's me.

66
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,999
You guessed it.

67
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,733
So this is your crew.

68
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,569
And it looks like you've
become a captain now, huh?

69
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:14,074
[ACE] Captain Marshall D.
Teach of the Blackbeard Pirates.

70
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,043
Zehahahaha!

71
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,745
C'mon Ace, lighten up!

72
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,480
It's good to see you again!

73
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:20,914
What brings you here?

74
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:23,250
You weren't looking
for me, were ya?

75
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,821
Let's stop beating around
the bush now, shall we?

76
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,891
Even if you play dumb,
I know you're a crafty bastard.

77
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,626
There's only one reason
for me to be here,

78
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,661
and you know what it is.

79
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,364
So spare me the chit-chat.

80
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,140
Fine, have it your way.

81
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,743
But there's one question
I'd like to ask first.

82
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,112
Instead of fighting,

83
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:54,347
why don't you become
a member of my crew?

84
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,785
I have the perfect plan
to rise to the top.

85
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:01,121
If you stick with me,
I swear, we can rule the world!

86
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,724
Whitebeard's days are
numbered and you know it.

87
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,059
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

88
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,928
First, I'm headed off to Water 7

89
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,164
to kill Straw Hat Luffy
as a special gift

90
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,932
to the World Government.

91
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:14,635
Wouldn't hurt to have
you along for the fun!

92
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,604
Luffy, huh?

93
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,105
You're out of your mind.

94
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,241
[TEACH] Oh? You know him?

95
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:23,276
[ACE] Of course I know him,
you sack of crap!

96
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,079
I'm not gonna let you
kill my little brother!

97
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,083
And I'm not
joining your crew.

98
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,486
You can take your little
offer and shove it up your--

99
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,720
[gunshot]

100
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,790
Well, you get it.

101
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:46,734
Heh.

102
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,903
Looks like you need to teach
your crew some manners, Captain.

103
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,271
[ACE] Fire Gun!

104
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,448
[ACE]

107
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,760
Both of you,
stay out of this fight!

108
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,629
Until you get stronger,
this guy's out of your league!

109
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,463
Do you hear me?

110
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,564
Oh, sorry.

111
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,232

00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:48,989
[TEACH] All right, Ace.

127
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,090
I get it.

128
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:51,958
You want to
finish me, don't you?

129
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:56,363
The murder of a fellow crewmate
is a serious crime, after all.

130
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,133
And yes, I killed fourth
division commander Thatch

131
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,434
with my own hands!

132
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,669
But there wasn't
any other choice!

133
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,037
Wasn't personal,

134
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,173
but he had the Devil Fruit
I'd been searching for!

135
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,309
You know the rules
on Whitebeard's ship.

136
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,444
Whoever finds one
of those gets to eat it.

137
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,379
I memorized the
shapes and colors

138
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:14,982
of all the Devil Fruits
that they've discovered,

139
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,617
so I knew that
was the one I needed.

140
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,787
[TEACH]
Whether I liked it or not,

141
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,856
I spent decades biding
my time on Whitebeard's ship,

142
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,424
because that was
the best shot I had

143
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,060
at finding that
one single fruit!

144
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:30,731
[TEACH] But just when I
thought there was no hope left,

145
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:34,701
there it was, right
in the hand of my friend.

146
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:39,606
Then you murdered him
in cold blood and stole it.

147
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,441
Without a second thought.

148
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,779
Bad luck for him.

149
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,280
There's no other way.

150
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,683
This ability has chosen me.

151
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,918
Zehahahaha!

152
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,153
And its power has made me

153
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,956
the strongest man
in the world!

154
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,458
[TEACH] Watch.

155
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:00,594
Even among the Logia Fruits,
there's nothing quite like it!

156
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:08,034
[TEACH] Ace, your body
is made of fire, right?

157
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,074
Zehahahahahaha!

[TOWNSMAN 325A] Look!

160
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,148
It's that weird
black smoke from before!

161
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,750
I thought those
pirates were leaving.

162
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,117
What're we gonna do now?

163
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,053
I don't know what they want,
but it can't be good!

164
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,322
They're gonna wreck the
entire town at this rate!

165
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,824
Well, we sure can't stop them!

166
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,591
It's best just to run away!

[ACE] Darkness?

00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,870
[TEACH] You'll see soon
enough, Commander Ace.

170
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,839
I think you'll want
to reconsider my offer.

171
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,607
In the history
of all Devil Fruits,

172
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,977
this is said to be the most
dangerous power of them all!

The Logia-Type
Dark Dark Fruit.

I've become a Darkness Man.

00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,353
I'll give you a
taste of its power.

176
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,755
I wouldn't blink if I were you.

177
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,458
Stop yapping and do it.

178
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,164
Now ain't the time for a nap!

179
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,565
Captain's on a rampage!

180
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,401
If we don't high tail it
outta here, he'll kill us, too!

181
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,737
Not you, too, damn it!

182
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:25,612
Zehahahahaha!

183
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,906
[TOWNSMAN 325D] Look, it's
crawling on the ground.

184
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,974
It keeps pouring
out of him more and more.

185
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:55,409
[TOWNSMAN 325E]
This is too creepy.

186
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,579
It's pitch black,
like a bottomless pit.

187
00:12:58,612 --> 00:12:59,980
What if it sucks us up?

188
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,582
Everyone, make a run for it!

189
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,782
Get out of here!

190
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,087
[TOWNSMAN 325D] Run to the
forest, run to the coast--

191
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,054
Just get away, quick!

192
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,795
[TEACH] Darkness is gravity.

193
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,031
It swallows
everything around it!

194
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,701
Even light itself can't escape!

195
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:23,136
Its power is infinite!

196
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,341
[ACE] That's nice,
but it's nowhere near me.

197
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,443
Are you sure you
got the hang of this?

198
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,544
[TEACH] Calm down.

199
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:32,679
I'm not aiming at you yet.

200
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:35,715
You'll be glad when you
see what I do to this town!

201
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:42,422
[TEACH] Black Hole!

202
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:45,986
[MAN 325A] Our town--

203
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,988
It's being swallowed
into the Earth!

204
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,590
[MAN 325B] Why is he doing this?

205
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,191
What's going on?

206
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,765
[TEACH] Within these shadows
lies the limitless power

207
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,368
to compress
anything and everything.

208
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,037
To crush whatever they touch!

209
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,720
[MAN 325C]
No, this is a nightmare.

210
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,187
My home!

211
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,132
[TEACH]
But that's just the beginning.

212
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:35,035
Now I'll show you
what happened to that town.

213
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:37,872
Or whatever's left
of it, I should say!

214
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:40,674
Liberation!

215
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,068
It's all gone...

216
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:10,103
Nothing left
but a pile of wood...

217
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,944
Zehahahahaha!

218
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,679
So do you get it now, Ace?

219
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:22,883
This was what I was
willing to kill a friend for!

220
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,117
Huh?

221
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:28,088
Firefly Fiery Doll!

222
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,223
[TEACH yelling]

223
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:36,296
[TEACH] Oh! Hot, hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

224
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,499
The darkness part I get,
but this, not so much.

225
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,035
I wonder what's going on here.

226
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,138
If you're a Logia-Type,
that shouldn't hurt you.

227
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,473
Or rather,
it shouldn't even hit you.

228
00:16:57,785 --> 00:16:59,319
I already told you.

229
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,621
My darkness swallows
everything around it.

230
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:04,925
Whether its punches, blades,
bullets, lightning, or fire!

231
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,360
[TEACH] Unlike you,

232
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,528
I can't just turn into an
element and dodge an attack.

233
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:10,431
And the pain
I absorb when I get hit

234
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:14,000
is much greater than
what a normal human feels.

235
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,071
But the tradeoff
for that inconvenience

236
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,538
is more than worth it.

237
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:21,775
'Cause there happens to be
one other thing I can absorb.

238
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,476
Black Vortex!

239
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,547
[TEACH] First, I use
the gravity of darkness

240
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:31,351
to pull a Devil Fruit
power holder into my grasp.

241
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,357
[ACE]
Too... strong...!

242
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,763
[TEACH] And then,
when I touch them...

243
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:44,698
[ACE groaning in pain]

244
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:50,071
You're smart.

245
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:54,074
Have you figured out
the secret yet? Huh?

246
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,676
It can't be...

247
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:11,791
Zehahahahaha!
Ahahahahaha!

248
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,304
It's been so long
since you've been hit,

249
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:27,641
I bet you forgot
how much it hurts, Ace.

250
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:29,310
[TEACH]
But you understand now.

251
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:32,312
You understood the
second I grabbed you.

252
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:35,549
Not only can my
darkness pull you in--

253
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:39,119
It can also absorb
your Devil Fruit power!

254
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:43,257
[TEACH] In other words, as long
as they're in contact with me,

255
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,958
someone with Devil Fruit powers

256
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:47,128
is no different
than a normal human.

257
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:49,930
Logia. Zoan. Paramythia.

258
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,698
All those with
Devil Fruit powers

259
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:54,668
who have become dependent
on them are in for a surprise.

260
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:58,471
One little touch will remind
them how weak they really are!

261
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:02,142
Then all I have
to do is avoid you.

262
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:04,945
[TEACH] If you think you can
escape gravity that easily,

263
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,047
I'd like to see you try!

264
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,249
Black Vortex!

265
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:14,387
[ACE] St. Elmo's Fire!

266
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,040
[TEACH] Damn it!
Get this offa me!

267
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:37,677
That bastard
almost broke my neck!

268
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:42,148
His ability's gonna be
a bigger pain than I thought.

269
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,285
[ACE] Cross Fire!

270
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,099
[MAN 325D]
Banana Rock is falling!

271
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:00,167
Nothing's safe anymore!

272
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:02,937
[MAN 325E] No human should
have this kind of power!

273
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,704
Who are these monsters?

274
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:08,441
Forget about the town,

275
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,677
they'll destroy
the entire island!

276
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,345
We're done for!

277
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,589
[AUGER]
This is quite a surprise.

278
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:25,359
Most Devil Fruit power holders
with one such as his

279
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,794
would be rendered ineffective
as soon as their trump card

280
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:29,363
was taken away from them.

281
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,165
Not so with Ace.

282
00:20:31,198 --> 00:20:34,401
His powers are not a crutch,
but an aid to his own talents.

283
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:37,704
We should expect no less from
one of Whitebeard's Commanders.

284
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:46,346
We're at the
crossroads of fate.

285
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,716
It's no coincidence that these
men have been brought together.

286
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:08,569
Everything falls
before darkness.

287
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:11,872
Even you can only
struggle for so long.

288
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:13,340
[TEACH] Still,
finishing you off here

289
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:16,009
would be a waste
of your talent.

290
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:19,346
Don't fight it, Ace! Join me!

291
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,355
If I surrendered to you,

292
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:31,859
then I could never
call myself a man again.

293
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:35,830
I won't submit, and I won't live
with regrets, no matter what.

294
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:37,631
You got that, stupid?

295
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,935
Once you die,
your morals are useless.

296
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,372
I'm sorry you can't
understand that, Ace.

297
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,710
Darkness take you!

298
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,379
[ACE] Great Flame Commandment!

299
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:02,389
[ACE] Flame Emperor!

300
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:09,897
Zehahahahaha!

301
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,865
The sun against darkness, huh?

302
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,435
Only one can win!

303
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:18,638
I'll make Whitebeard
the King, or die trying.

304
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:52,806
[NARRATOR] Although no one
realized it at the time,

305
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,641
the duel at
Banero Island that day

306
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:55,809
was not merely a struggle

307
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:57,911
between Whitebeard
and Blackbeard;

308
00:22:57,944 --> 00:22:59,346
it was a catalyst.

309
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,682
This was the beginning
of a chain of events

310
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,050
that would change the world.

311
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,127
[LUFFY] Full speed ahead!

312
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:15,529
Time for a new adventure!

313
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,898
[SANJI] Beautiful mermaid
island, here we come!

314
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:19,032
[USOPP] Whoa-whoa-whoa
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

315
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,267
We're in dangerous waters here!

316
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,102
Would it kill you
to use a little caution?

317
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,737
[LUFFY] Look, Sanji!
It's another ship!

318
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,105
[SANJI]
With no sail and no flag.

319
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,307
[USOPP] See, I knew it--
We're in trouble already!

320
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:29,042
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

321
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,944
The Mysterious Band of Pirates!

322
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,080
Sunny and the Dangerous Trap!

323
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:36,016
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
