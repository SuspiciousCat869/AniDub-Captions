1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:38,258
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,693
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:45,365
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:50,403
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,274
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,677
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,913
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,550
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,519
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,422
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,791
[laughter]

48
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,795
[USOPP] And now, for his
next trick, Usopp will fly!

49
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,463
Here goes!

50
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,799
[LUFFY] Whoa! That was awesome!

51
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,868
[CHOPPER]
Okay, me next! Me next!

52
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,636
[USOPP] Yeah! Go for it!
[LUFFY] Alright!

53
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,817
[USOPP] Whoa! Uh-oh!
Watch the landing!

54
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,319
[thud]

55
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,991
[hammering]

56
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,794
Damn it.
Show some gratitude!

57
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,562
I meant well!

58
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:54,500
[NAMI] Wha...
What're you doing? Stop!

59
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,501
What, can't you read?

60
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,771
Don't tell me you didn't
see the sign out there!

61
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,973
Well, whatever.

62
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,674
I was gonna surprise
everyone later,

63
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,477
but I guess I'll give you a
sneak peek, since you're here.

64
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,313
Let's keep this as a secret
between the two of us.

65
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,514
So how do you like it?

66
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,616
Perfect, right?

67
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,850
The design was a little bland,

68
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,020
so I gave it a new look while
I was making modifications.

69
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,456
But I've never seen a
propulsion system like this,

70
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,291
so it took me longer
than I thought.

71
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,525
Worth it, though.

72
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,929
That was mine! Stupid!

73
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,699
And what's with this
ridiculous design?

74
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,370
Wha... What do you mean?
Just look. It's a horse.

75
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,704
If you don't know
how it works,

76
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,373
then you shouldn't mess with it!

77
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,307
This was a waver!

78
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,676
It belongs in the water,
not on a carousel!

79
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,378
Why would you
put a horse on it?

80
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,380
Uh, sorry...

81
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,050
[FRANKY] Now we're done.

82
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,887
They won't complain this time.
It's a masterpiece!

83
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,490
Can't wait to setcha loose!

84
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,461
[LUFFY] "The Mysterious Skeleton
Floating Through the Fog!

85
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,298
Venture into the Devil's Sea!"

86
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:04,570
[USOPP] All right,
next up is Luffy! Go!

87
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,711
[USOPP and CHOPPER] Awesome!
It's a new record!

88
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,516
Nami-sweet.
Robin-dear. It's ready!

89
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,319
[LUFFY] Round two! This time,
all three of us'll jump!

90
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:19,852
[USOPP and CHOPPER] Yeah!

91
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,754
Hey, you guys.

92
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,657
If you got so much energy,
catch me some octopus.

93
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,760
I think the tree swing can
take care of itself for a while.

94
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,761
[ALL THREE] Octopus?

95
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,931
[SANJI] Yeah. Octopus
Rice, Octopus Shabu.

96
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:35,068
And last but not least,
Octopus pomodoro piled high!

97
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,936
I like this one extra spicy!

98
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,538
So if all that
sounds good to you,

99
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,107
try to get the ingredients
by dinner time.

100
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,842
Yeah! Sounds good!

101
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,379
Sanji! Can you
make takoyaki, too?

102
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,948
[USOPP and CHOPPER]
Takoyaki party!

103
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,783
Of course. No prob.

104
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,452
So. Grab a bunch of 'em.

105
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,454
[ALL THREE] All right!

106
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,057
[ROBIN] It's quite
lively out there.

107
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,392
Oh, perfect timing.

108
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,961
Sanji made one of
these for you, too.

109
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,896
How kind.

110
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,036
Okay.

111
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,378
Tricky things keep slipping
away from me. Darn it.

112
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,979
All right, let me try!

113
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:20,947
No, wait.

114
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,915
If you Devil Fruit users
fall in that water,

115
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,551
we're gonna have to fish you
out along with the octopus.

116
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,487
Leave this one to me!

117
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,926
Huh? Usopp?

118
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,966
[USOPP] Where are
they hiding? Whoa!

119
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,634
They're really packed tight.

120
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,504
But I had a feeling
it'd be like this.

121
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,840
Sorry octobuddies,
but I came prepared.

122
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,177
It's a hard
lesson to learn,

123
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,080
but nothing comes
between me and my dinner!

124
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,750
Now get ready!

125
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,588
Wow, one already!

126
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,792
[USOPP] Here comes
my secret technique!

127
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,679
This sucks! Literally!

128
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,717
[NAMI] Oh no!

129
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,953
[ROBIN] That doesn't look good.

130
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,459
[USOPP] Let go!

131
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,727
[NAMI] Ah! Ewww...

132
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,029
What's going on down there?

133
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,731
The water turned all black
and I can't see a thing!

134
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,734
Hey! Are you okay?

135
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,536
[NAMI]
Usopp's in trouble, you guys!

136
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,472
He's in the middle
of an octopus sandwich!

137
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,973
What?

138
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,643
Usopp! Grab on!

139
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,917
[CHOPPER] Usopp!
You're not dead, are you?

140
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,153
[LUFFY] Answer me!

141
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,757
[USOPP]
No more mister nice guy!

142
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,860
It's no good.

143
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,529
Unless the water clears up,
I don't think I can find him.

144
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,603
Maybe this'll give
me a better view.

145
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,573
Gum-Gum Gatling!

146
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,616
Ha! That did it!

147
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,750
Thank goodness!

148
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,785
Wow, thanks pal!

149
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,188
What's the big deal?
It's just octopus.

150
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,222
Yeah?

151
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,191
Well why don't you try
going down there, then!

152
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,560
What are those idiots doing?

153
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,297
Hm?!

154
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,933
[ZORO] Hey! There's something
floating in the ocean!

155
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,768
[LUFFY] Ooh! Let me see!

156
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,269
[USOPP] Where is it?

157
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,870
[SANJI] There!

158
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,139
[CHOPPER] A barrel?

159
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,109
Huh? I think it says
"treasure" on it!

160
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,711
Huh? Hey, you're right!

161
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,314
Maybe it fell off
a treasure ship!

162
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,282
[CHOPPER and SANJI]
Let's find out!

163
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,918
[USOPP] Hurry up, Luffy!
Pull it in already!

164
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,094
[LUFFY] I'm on it!

165
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,760
Treasure time!
Treasure time!

166
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,929
Open it up and
see what's inside!

167
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,097
Whatever it is,
it's gonna be mine!

168
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,500
[NAMI] Pity. It's probably
just some old booze

169
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,434
and preserved food.

170
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,671
What? You can't see inside!
How do you know?

171
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:35,107
Because it says "a treasure
offering to the sea gods."

172
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,243
It's an old practice
called "Barrel Drifting."

173
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,444
People pray for safe passage

174
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:42,281
by making an offering to the
guardian spirits of the sea.

175
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,117
So, it's more about superstition
than actual treasure.

176
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,118
[USOPP]
In other words,

177
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,121
we got our hopes up over
a barrel of sea trash.

178
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,624
[ZORO]
Whoa. Who says booze is trash?

179
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,358
Let's drink it.

180
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,627
What? No!
That's bad karma!

181
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,896
You'll be fine.
Just say a little prayer first.

182
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,131
I pray to no
God--sea or otherwise.

183
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,734
Alcohol stirred by the waves.

184
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,236
From what I hear,
that improves the taste.

185
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,573
Oh, yeah?
Let's find out!

186
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,642
All right, then
we'll make a toast!

187
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,644
After you finish, they
say that you're supposed

188
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,645
to add a new offering

189
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,715
and set it adrift again
for good luck. Okay?

190
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,217
Who cares? Open up!

191
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,954
So. Hey, God?!
We're stealing your booze!

192
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,991
Ha! Now you're
praying to god?

193
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,094
If I remember, you beat the crap
out of "God" back on Skypeia.

194
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,962
Don't bother. God's a jerk.

195
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,298
[LUFFY] Prayer's over.
Here goes.

196
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,003
Okay, let me see.

197
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,171
[USOPP] Whoa! What is that?

198
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,177
Fireworks?

199
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,813
It sure is bright, huh?

200
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,950
Wha... What's going on?

201
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,923
[CHOPPER] The booze flew in
the air, and then it blew up!

202
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,659
Looks like a
signal flare.

203
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:00,760
You think that's it?

204
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,994
Hahahaha

205
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,031
Guess the Sea God didn't like
you messing with his stuff!

206
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:09,368
It could just be a prank,
I suppose, but if it's not...

207
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,203
"If it's not"?

208
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,106
Perhaps, we've alerted someone

209
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,841
and they're about
to come looking for us.

210
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,277
[USOPP] Ahh! You mean
the booze was a lie?

211
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,945
No, even worse, it was a trap!

212
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,814
And we set it off
by opening the barrel!

213
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,382
Who knows what kind
of horrible people

214
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,051
are gonna come after us now!

215
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,852
Chopper!
Search the area!

216
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:27,820
[CHOPPER] Got it!

217
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,021
[USOPP] Make sure we're
not being followed!

218
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,057
Those awful bounty hunters
might be looking for revenge!

219
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,658
[CHOPPER] I'm looking
all over the place,

220
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,360
but I don't see anyone!

221
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,828
Nothing here.

222
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,998
Something isn't right.
I can feel it.

223
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,232
[thinking]
It's the air pressure.

224
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,301
The clouds are moving fast, too.

225
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,135
[gasps]

226
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,070
[NAMI]
Everyone get into position!

227
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,739
We're going to escape
south by southwest!

228
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,708
A huge storm is
coming in five minutes!

229
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,875
I don't see anything,

230
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,078
but if you say it's coming
I'll take your word for it,

231
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,245
since you're the navigator!

232
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,914
[LUFFY] By the way,
what's our heading?

233
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,083
[NAMI]
Two o'clock, straight ahead!

234
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,033
Did that barrel
summon a storm or what?

235
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,773
That lightning's
hitting really close!

236
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,850
No good. We're getting
straight headwind.

237
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,618
The ship's gonna overturn!

238
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,431
Hey! The Sunny
can handle this!

239
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,766
You know the trick!

240
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,034
Oh, right! Hey guys!

241
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,871
Raise the sails!
It's paddle time!

242
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,106
Augh. Yeah! Okay!

243
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:59,111
Ha. I like the
sound of that! Do it! Go!

244
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,384
[NAMI] Everyone ready?

245
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,253
The main is good to go, Nami!

246
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,321
The floor mast
is up and ready!

247
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,791
Franky! Now!

248
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:16,395
Sweet! Soldier Dock System.
Channel Zero.

249
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,935
[NAMI] Cola Engine!
Paddle Ship. Sunny!

250
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,006
Go!

251
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,443
Full speed!

252
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,168
[NAMI sighs] We made it.

253
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,938
[ZORO] Yeah, it's nice we
got out of the storm and all,

254
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,973
but where the hell are we?

255
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,008
It shouldn't be
night yet, right?

256
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,376
So why is it so dark?

257
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,512
And what's with this fog?
Strange, huh?

258
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,547
This is it.
We paddled the Sunny straight

259
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,116
into that sea Kokoro
was talking about.

260
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,985
Jeez. I wasn't ready for this.

261
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,288
Oh! Wow. So we're at
Fishman Island already?

262
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:20,492
Not yet. Remember?
The Sea of Ghosts?

263
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,995
That's right. Be careful.

264
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,065
You've heard of the
Florian Triangle, right?

265
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:30,469
Y'know, it's also called--
The Devil's Triangle!

266
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,972
A haunted sea where ships

267
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,474
are swallowed by the
darkness without a trace!

268
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,911
[USOPP trembling] H-H-Haunted?

269
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:43,249
[snickers] Bring on
the ghosts! I can't wait!

270
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,250
Shut up!

271
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,919
Why does everyone know
about this except me?

272
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:50,256
If this is some kinda
prank, it's not funny!

273
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,092
Zoro.

274
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,161
[LUFFY] Nuh-uh! It's real!

275
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,864
And I hear there's zombies
and skeletons, too!

276
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,368
[USOPP] Why are you
happy about this, Luffy?

277
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,072
[SANJI] You're letting
your imagination run wild.

278
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,074
Stop trying to scare him.

279
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,610
[SANJI] Listen, Usopp.

280
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:15,447
The truth of the matter is
every year, over a hundred ships

281
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,417
vanish in these waters
without any explanation.

282
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,220
They say.
The sailor's souls stay

283
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,024
on the ships wandering
for all eternity!

284
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,460
Auuggh! No! Why didn't
you warn me about this?

285
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,630
[SANJI] Even if we had,
there's nothing you can do!

286
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,598
[USOPP] Sure there is!

287
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,301
I'm gonna cover myself
in anti-ghost stuff!

288
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,812

let me borrow some, too!

If you talk

then you'll be
pulled into the sea!

Don't answer them, no matter

[SANJI] Not so fast.
You can't go alone

324
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:22,084
[ZORO] Listen up.

325
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:23,185
We're drawing straws
to decide who stays here

326
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:26,622
and who goes on the
creepy ghost ship with Luffy.

There's plenty of people
who want to go already!

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,262
Yeah! That's cruel!

331
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:34,263
Let us stay!

332
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:37,132
You really sure that's
how you wanna do this?

333
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,867
[USOPP]
Huh?

334
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:40,903
[LUFFY] Ready to see
some ghosts and stuff?

335
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:42,938
[FRANKY] Yeah!

336
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:44,706
Please no!

Hey. I like the

Yeah! Please! We're scared!

00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:51,980
You can't leave all
the weak people alone

with no one to protect them!

341
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,618
[NAMI] We'll draw!
We'll draw! Just don't go!

342
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:58,821
Whatever! I'm fine
going there alone!

343
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,157
But we've gotta hurry, or this
ship is gonna get away!

344
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:04,259
Hold your horses.

345
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:07,663
Well? Are you gonna draw?

346
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,632
Two will go, and the
rest will stay here.

347
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:12,634
[ZORO] Gotta keep
a tight leash on him.

348
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:14,837
Or Luffy'll do something stupid.

349
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:25,747
[NAMI sobs] Why did it have
to be me, of all people?

350
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:27,783
I want a recount.

351
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:31,019
[LUFFY] Nami! Get up here!
It's ghost time!

352
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,688
[NAMI] Gimme a second!

353
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,923
[LUFFY] This is why
I said I would go alone!

354
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:36,792
[SANJI] Yeah, that'd be great.
You'd go sailing off

355
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:40,329
with a bunch of skeletons
and we'd never see you again.

356
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:44,166
[NAMI]
Should've made Usopp go.

357
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,703
Nami swan!
Don't you worry!

358
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,706
Your sweet prince is
here to protect you!

359
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,208
You think you can kick a ghost?

360
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,677
C'mon, you were all
excited about finding

361
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:56,879
a treasure ship before!

362
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:59,314
[NAMI] There is no way in
hell this is a treasure ship!

363
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:01,850
Look at it!
It's got singing skeletons!

364
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:02,651
Well, maybe he's the one

365
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:04,620
guarding all the
awesome treasure.

366
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:06,822
Anyway. I'm going!

367
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,868
There he is.

368
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:34,850
[NAMI screams]

369
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,084
Evil things be gone!

370
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,922
Out with you!
Let Luffy rest in peace!

371
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:44,326
Whoa.

372
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:53,035
[SKELETON] Why, good afternoon!
Yohohohoho!

373
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:54,937
Thank you all for stopping by!

374
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:57,773
You must excuse me for not
greeting you properly before!

375
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,908
I really was quite surprised!

376
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:00,842
It's been so many years,

377
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:03,845
you see, wandering
these waters all alone!

378
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:06,748
I'm so used to ghost ships
that humans frightened me!

379
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:08,417
Quite ironic, isn't it?

380
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,453
Ah, but please, come
inside and take a seat.

381
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:13,255
I'm sure you have
many tales to share!

382
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:15,090
Look! It can talk!

383
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:17,960
It's a singing,
talking afro skeleton!

384
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,928
Well, I'll be damned.

385
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:23,131
Oh, my!

386
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:28,804
What a charming young
woman you are! Beautiful!

387
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:31,974
Huh? Oh, no.

388
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,744
I'm all eyes for
ladies like you.

389
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:40,916
Or I would be if skeletons
had any eyes. Yo ho ho ho!

390
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,331
Could you, perhaps,
show me your panties?

391
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:57,499
[NAMI] Yeah, right!

392
00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:01,003
Yo ho ho! Fiesty! I like it!

393
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:04,172
[SKELETON] That hurt me
right down to the bone--

394
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,774
because I'm a skeleton, you see!

395
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:07,175
I get it!

396
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,180
That kick just gave him
swelling on his skull!

397
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,350
Hey. Wait.
Do skeletons poop?

398
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,818
We've got like
a million questions

399
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:19,354
to ask before that one!

400
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:26,194
[SKELETON hums]

401
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,863
Oh, yes. I poop.

402
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,865
Haven't you ever
heard of TMI?

403
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:31,433
We don't need to hear that!

404
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:33,802
Anyway, how is
it that you can sing

405
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:36,371
and talk like that when
you're nothing but bones?

406
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,807
Are you really the
living dead, or what?

407
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,375
Also, why are you here?

408
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,811
And what the hell
happened to this ship?

409
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:45,380
These waters aren't
really haunted, are they?

410
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,015
We need answers!

411
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:52,187
[LUFFY] Hold on.
I got one for ya. Ya ready?

412
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,223
Will you join our crew?

413
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,393
Yes. Certainly.

414
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:04,066
[slurps]

415
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,582
[SKELETON] Yohohohoho!
Hello and good day to everyone!

416
00:23:20,582 --> 00:23:23,318
Once dead and all bones,
my name is Brook!

417
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:25,854
[ZORO] Why did you bring this
thing back onto our ship?

418
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:27,055
[LUFFY] He's funny, huh?

419
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:28,557
He's gonna be
our new crew member!

420
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,058
[ZORO] Oh no. He is not!

421
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:31,093
[BROOK] Let's be civilized!

422
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,327
Why don't you
treat me to dinner?

423
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,428
[ZORO] Don't invite yourself!

424
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,030
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

425
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:36,865
"The Joy of Seeing People!

426
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:39,434
The Gentleman Skeleton's
True Identity!"

427
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:41,870
I'm going to be
King of the Pirates!
