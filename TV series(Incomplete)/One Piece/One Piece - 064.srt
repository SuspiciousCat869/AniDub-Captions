00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,341
The Marines must have made
a mistake on that poster.

176
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,942
It does make sense!

177
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,778
I can understand why
this guy would have

178
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,280
a thirty‐million berry
bounty put on his head.

179
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,849
He must be the real
captain of those pirates!

180
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,153
Yeah. He must be...
It seemed strange

181
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,722
that that weakling would
fetch such a high price.

182
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,159
[IGARAPPOI] Even if this
guy is the real captain,

183
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,994
this is getting disgraceful.

184
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,129
The Boss put us
in charge of this town,

185
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,798
and he's not going
to be very pleased

186
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:22,001
if we lose to one measly pirate.

187
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,371
Well, then, looks as
if we finally get to fight.

188
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,907
[MR. 9]
Something you may not know,

189
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,743
in Baroque Works, the
smaller an agent's number is,

190
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,513
the greater their power, as well
as their rank in the company.

191
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,517
Take the two of us,
Mr. 9 and Mr. 8,

192
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,820
we're single‐digit agents.

193
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,189
And don't forget Miss Wednesday.

194
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,423
Our abilities are much greater

195
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,328
than the riffraff you've been
fighting against so far tonight.

196
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,064
Hmph! I've found that
fancy titles mean nothing

197
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,732
when it comes to fighting.

198
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,101
The strongest wins,
and that's it.

199
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,947
[IGARAPPOI]
Igarappa!

200
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,216
Let's go, Miss Wednesday!

201
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,384
Of course, Mr. 9!

202
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,021
[whistles]
Come here, Karoo!

203
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,923
Quaaaaaaack!

204
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,795
No, not shake! Now, come here!

205
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,431
Come on, Karoo.
Show them how fast you are!

206
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,866
Leave them in the dust...

207
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,934
Quaaack!

208
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,404
I didn't tell you
to sit, now did I?!

209
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,039
You kidding...? A duck?

210
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,942
[MR. 9 laughs]
You get distracted so easily.

211
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:40,379
How can you hope
to follow my acrobatics?

212
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:45,084
You better prepare for...
my Bloody Bat!

213
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,119
Hahaha!

214
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:53,058
You'd better be careful not
to chip your precious blades!

215
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,059
[MR. 9]
What's the matter?

216
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,928
Are you too afraid to fight me?

217
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,938
What happened to
your fancy acrobatics, huh?

218
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,474
Watch really carefully, now!

219
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,346
Aaaaah!

220
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,516
[crash]

221
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,085
[ZORO] Is this really
the best they can do?

222
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,521
There's better. I'm still here.

223
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,258
Are you ready... Mister Bushido?

224
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,827
Take a look at this.

225
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,430
What do you think, bad boy?

226
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,332
Hm?

227
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,603
Now enjoy my perfume dance...

228
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:56,355
[coughs]

229
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,191
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
Good boy.

230
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:08,334
And now... Peacock Slasher!

231
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,301
Go, Karoo!

232
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,570
Quaaaack!

233
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,408
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
You ran right past him!

234
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,183
Man, these guys are so pathetic,

235
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,051
fighting them is starting
to get embarrassing.

236
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,394
[IGARAPPOI] He slipped
down through that hole.

237
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,498
That won't keep him safe...

238
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,668
[IGARAPPOI]
Come back here, swordsman,

239
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,604
and get a taste of
just how dangerous I am.

240
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,073
That horn of his
complicates things...

241
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,110
How do I get close
enough to fight?

242
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,079
Aaaaugh!

243
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,249
[MR. 9] You may
have won the first fight,

244
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,084
but you won't get away with it.

245
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,586
No tricks from you this time!

246
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,122
[ZORO] I didn't trick you;
you jumped off a building!

247
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,391
Now for my Home Run Sneaky Bat!

248
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,430
[MR. 9] Hahaha! What'cha
gonna do now, tough guy?

249
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,432
Kick your ass.

250
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,734
Hmph! Excellent work

251
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:20,239
[chuckles] Come on...
Do it Mr. 8! Kill him, now!

252
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,540
Hahaha! You won't get away!

253
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,109
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
That's right. Don't move.

254
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,979
If you even think about doing
anything foolish, Mr. Bushido,

255
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,615
your friend here will
be paying the price...

256
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,620
[snores]

257
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,990
Hahahah! Well done,
Miss Wednesday.

258
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,491
It looks like there
will be no escape

259
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,292
for the swordsman this time,

260
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,995
unless he wants
his friend to die.

261
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,229
You idiot!

262
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,632
Can't he at least wake up
when he's being held hostage...?

263
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,567
[IGARAPPOI]
Preparing to fire.

264
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:53,138
Firing squad... ready!

265
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,973
[ZORO]
What?!

266
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,143
Igarappappa!

267
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,479
Oh great, more guns!

268
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,683
[gasps]

269
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,685
Aaaaaah!

270
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,132
[IGARAPPOI]
Igarappappa!

271
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,267
Igarappappa!

272
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,369
[ZORO] Gotta borrow
your stomach, Luffy.

273
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,617
All right... Done.

274
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,563
[ZORO] Now maybe I can
get some peace and quiet.

275
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:56,201
Where am I? How did
I get outside? That's weird.

276
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,541
[MAN 1] Three single‐digit
agents lost to one man.

277
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,043
I never thought I'd see
the day that would happen.

278
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,079
[MAN 2]
We've got to escape from here,

279
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,213
but where do we go?

280
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,915
We're just gonna
have to find some place

281
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,985
to hide until
this all blows over.

282
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,022
The Unluckies are here...! No!

283
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,558
Now hold on a second.

284
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,527
I know it looks like
we're running away,

285
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,995
but we're not, I promise!

286
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,196
Please spare us...!

287
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,999
Please don't report us
to the Boss, okay?

288
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,271
Aaaaaah!

289
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,572
[MR. 5]
Hold it!

290
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,742
[MISS VALENTINE]
There's a lot of action tonight

291
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,076
for such a sleepy town.

292
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,945
Shouldn't everyone be in bed?

293
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,948
[MR. 5] Heh! The Boss sends us
all the way to the front lines,

294
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,216
and this is what we find...?

295
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,585
What a pathetic little group...

296
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,088
[explosion]

297
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,091
[screams]

298
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,701
Hmm?

299
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,704
[IGARAPPOI pants]

300
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:06,939
Can't die here...

301
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,107
I have an important
mission to complete.

302
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,276
I must keep going...

303
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,313
[MR. 5] Three of you lost
against a single pirate...?

304
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,081
Now that's just sad.

305
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,749
[gasps]

306
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,620
[IGARAPPOI]
Mr. 5! Miss Valentine!

307
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,656
Really...
Can't do your jobs...? Hm.

308
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,959
[laughs]
Well...

309
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,761
That's clearly the difference
between our rank and yours...

310
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,331
Ugh... You came here...
just to laugh at us?

311
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,766
Nah... That's a bonus...

312
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,737
Ahahaha! We're here
under the Boss's orders.

313
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,839
Hahaha! With you
guys here to fight,

314
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,241
we can finally defeat him.

315
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,810
He doesn't stand a
chance against you...

316
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,678
[MISS WEDNESDAY] That's right!
Let's track him down

317
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,182
and show him what
Baroque Works can really do!

318
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,752
[MR. 5] Seriously, Miss
Wednesday, stop with the jokes.

319
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,921
We didn't come here
to clean up your mess.

320
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,656
[MISS VALENTINE] You really
think that we'd come all the way

321
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,325
to the end of the Grand Line,
to hold your hands?

322
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,128
Ha! You're even more
pitiful than you look.

323
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:06,665
[MR. 9] But... But then what
mission are you here for?

324
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,133
You mean you
haven't figured it out?

325
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,935
There are people here whose
crimes against the company

326
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,805
are grave enough that the Boss
has sent us to deal with 'em.

327
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,141
[MR. 9]
Huh?

328
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,676
[MR. 5] He said someone
had learned his secrets...

329
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,711
I don't know
what secrets exactly,

330
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,979
and I don't wanna know.

331
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,948
Obviously, someone else did...

332
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,217
But knowing them is
against company rules...

333
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,351
Our motto is mystery.

334
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,720
Everyone's identity is
to be kept strictly secret,

335
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,022
no matter who they are.

336
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,392
And if someone's dumb enough to
nose around the Boss's business,

337
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,229
well then, that's a crime
punishable by death.

338
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,065
So, while we were conducting
our search to find out

339
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,733
who had uncovered
the Boss's secrets,

340
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,369
we learned something. Hahaha!

341
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,004
It turns out...

342
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,874
A rather high ranking individual
from a certain kingdom

343
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:52,044
has somehow managed to
infiltrate Baroque Works.

344
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:55,247
[MR. 9] A kingdom...?!
Wait, wait, hold on a second!

345
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,381
I may be wearing a crown,

346
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,750
but I'm not a king or
anything like that, I swear.

347
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,385
It's just an
innocent little hobby.

348
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,154
Shut up you idiot...

349
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,221
You still don't get it.

350
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,023
We need the people
from Alabasta.

351
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,726
They're the ones
who angered the Boss.

352
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,863
[IGARAPPOI]
They know...! It's all over now.

353
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,033
Die...! Igarappappa!

354
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,102
You will not lay a
hand upon our princess!

355
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,339
Not while the captain of
Alabasta security still stands!

356
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,407
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
Igaram!

357
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,745
[MR. 5] Igaram,
Captain of Alabasta security

358
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,715
and Princess Vivi Nefertari,
of Alabasta Kingdom,

359
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,117
we have come here in the name
of the Boss of Baroque Works,

360
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,853
to see that you are
both eliminated.

361
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,922
[gasps]

362
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,394
This could be good...

363
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,796
I left Luffy down
there with them.

364
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:07,986
<i>♪Oh, you've got me heart and soul</i>

365
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,757
<i>I wrote you a</i>
<i>love song to let you</i>

366
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:18,964
<i>Know that I wanna be with you</i>
<i>'til the end of time</i>

367
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,299
<i>Even when the sparkle fades</i>

368
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:26,471
<i>The doubts invade our</i>
<i>once so trusting minds</i>

369
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,007
<i>Promise you that I will stay,</i>

370
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:34,846
<i>we'll find a way to look</i>
<i>through the cloudy skies</i>

371
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,483
<i>We built a castle of sand</i>

372
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:42,354
<i>And now we're</i>
<i>watching it wash away,</i>

373
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:46,258
<i>It doesn't have to end</i>

374
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,494
<i>We'll start again,</i>
<i>this time 'round,</i>

375
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:54,166
<i>we'll build a stronger love</i>

376
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,936
<i>Oh, you've got me heart and soul</i>

377
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:02,040
<i>I just wanna hold you</i>
<i>and not let go</i>

378
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:09,481
<i>You know that I'll be</i>
<i>with you 'til the end of time</i>

379
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:12,884
<i>Oh, you've got me heart and soul♪</i>

380
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,058
[ZORO] Why do I have
to help Nami make money?

381
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,393
Can't she do it herself?

382
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,561
[LUFFY]
Zoro!

383
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,896
[ZORO] What's wrong, Luffy?
I have to fight you, too?

384
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,065
[LUFFY] I'm gonna beat
you up, you ungrateful jerk!

385
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,066
[ZORO]
What are you talking about?

386
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,034
[LUFFY]
Don't give me that!

387
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,869
I'm not gonna forgive you!
Now, fight me!

388
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,370
[ZORO]
You can't be serious...

389
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,207
[LUFFY] On the next
One Piece: "All Out Battle!

390
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:38,510
Luffy vs. Zoro,
Mysterious Grand Duel!"

391
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,046
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
