1
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,116
[SANJI]
Should we go after Franky?

2
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,585
[ZORO]
And start looking where?

3
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,254
[SANJI] Aw, man, looks
like these idiots really

4
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,656
didn't know where
he took the money.

5
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,526
Even if we do manage
to find Franky.

6
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:09,296
If he spent it, there's
no getting it back.

7
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,030
[ZORO]
What now?

8
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:10,897
Even if we wait
around for him,

9
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:14,401
he may not be back
for quite a while.

10
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,403
Hanging around here
won't do any good.

11
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,172
Let's head back
to the ship for now.

12
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,507
We left Nami there
all by herself.

13
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,479
And Robin's still missing.
The ship's a problem, too.

14
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:26,413
[ZORO]
Yeah.

15
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,281
Hey, Luffy!

16
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,120
[LUFFY]
I've made a decision.

17
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,421
About the ship.

18
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,156
Huh?

19
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,660
It's time to part
ways with the Merry.

20
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,795
We'll say goodbye
to her here.

21
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,771
[LUFFY]

22
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,615
Hey! Usopp's finally
awake, you guys!

23
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,385
All right! Good to hear!

24
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,252
[NAMI sighs]

25
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:07,520
That's one less thing
to worry about.

26
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,659
[LUFFY]
Hey, Usopp!

27
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:20,467
[SANJI] Huh... Robin
still isn't back yet.

28
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,369
[NAMI]
You know,

29
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,138
I oughta punch you for
scaring us like that!

30
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,407
Yeah, no kidding.

31
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,443
Though it looks like you've
taken enough punches already,

32
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,544
if you ask me.

33
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:34,214
What were you thinking
taking those guys on alone?

34
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,584
You can't just run off
and fight whoever you want.

35
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,719
[ZORO] Oh that's a good
one, coming from you!

36
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,654
[LUFFY]
Hahahaha!

37
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,390
This wouldn't have happened
if I was strong like you guys.

38
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,225
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,760
It's all my fault.

40
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,195
I'm so ashamed of myself.

41
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,504
Hey, hey, stop! I get it!
I know you're sorry,

42
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,140
but you don't have to get
all touchy, feely on me okay?!

43
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,342
[USOPP]
But all our savings!

44
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,810
All that trouble
we went through!

45
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,511
What about the Merry?

46
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,281
Take it easy! You shouldn't
be out of bed yet!

47
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,582
C'mon, calm down.

48
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,418
Stop your whining and
listen to the doctor!

49
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,389
[USOPP] So is there a chance

50
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,791
we might get our
money back after all?

51
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,393
Well, maybe.

52
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,230
We won't know for sure
'til that Franky guy shows up.

53
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,799
I see. I'm sorry.

54
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,735
Hey, even if we can't
get the rest back,

55
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:32,039
we still have a hundred million
Berries left over! Don't worry!

56
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,308
Hahahahaha!

57
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,144
[NAMI] Yeah, but he
lost twice that much!

58
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:37,811
[CHOPPER]
Nami.

59
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,281
[NAMI]
Eh. Sorry, Usopp.

60
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,549
No, it's fine.

61
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:47,220
More importantly, is
Merry gonna be okay?

62
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:51,725
I mean, can we get her repaired
with the money we have left?

63
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,460
We're lucky we have all
these awesome shipwrights

64
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,527
to work on her.

65
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,497
But I know things are
gonna get rough out there,

66
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,667
so I want her to be
stronger than ever before.

67
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,236
We gotta do a lot more
than just a little touch up.

68
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,638
So do you think those
guys'll still do a good job

69
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,141
if we only have 100
million to pay with?

70
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,642
You talked to
them about it, right?

71
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,344
[LUFFY]
Uh... yeah.

72
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,412
But we aren't
having them repair it.

73
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,649
We decided to get
a new ship instead.

74
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,418
Eh?

75
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,620
I know that we probably
should've asked you first

76
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,555
but we didn't have much choice.

77
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,357
Either way, I've
made up my mind.

78
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,526
The Going Merry has
taken good care of us.

79
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:29,162
But it looks like our journey
with her has to end here.

80
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:47,982
[LUFFY]
Anyway.

81
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,085
Ice Pops gave us this awesome
ship catalogue to flip through.

82
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:53,487
There's all kinds of different
ships we could pick from here.

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,756
And if we decided to
shop for a used model.

84
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,558
We could go bigger
than the Merry.

85
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,760
And still keep our budget
under a hundred million.

86
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,662
[USOPP]
Wait.

87
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,930
Just stop.

88
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:08,102
I get it, Luffy but the joke's
gone on long enough, okay? See?

89
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,803
Chopper doesn't
know you're kidding!

90
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,406
Look how upset
this is making him!

91
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,074
Jeez, Captain, you
should know better

92
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,809
than to treat
your crew like that!

93
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,311
Come on, Nami,
back me up here.

94
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,485
Hold up does
that mean we,

95
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,354
we don't have
enough for the repairs?

96
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,291
It's 'cause I lost the
200 million, isn't it?

97
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,226
And now we can't afford
the work on the Merry.

98
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,594
Is that what this is about?

99
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:34,661
After all,

100
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,264
a first-class shipyard is
gonna cost a lot, right?

101
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,199
Would you stop
and listen to me?!

102
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,802
What is it?! Tell me!

103
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,437
Don't try to sugarcoat it!

104
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,705
I'm not, okay?!

105
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,708
I don't even care that you lost
all the money, that's over now!

106
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:48,909
If that's how you feel,

107
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,678
then what's with all this
crap about buying a new ship?!

108
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,146
Both of you, stop it!

109
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,148
Fighting isn't gonna help.

110
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,182
Just calm down for a sec!

111
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,519
I don't see what
I'm doing wrong!

112
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,487
He's the one saying
all this dumb stuff!

113
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,488
[NAMI]
I know how you feel,

114
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,291
but you shouldn't get
so worked up right now.

115
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:05,459
Listen to Nami, Usopp,

116
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,429
if you don't get any rest,
you're not gonna get better!

117
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:09,763
Who cares about me?!

118
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,632
How can you just sit here
when he's making jokes

119
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,334
about getting a new ship?

120
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:14,735
I'm not joking about anything,

121
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,804
this was a hard
decision for me, too!

122
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:20,107
Oh yeah, I feel
really sorry for you!

123
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,342
Already window-shopping
for a new toy!

124
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,312
You trying to pick
a fight with me?!

125
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,248
I don't want your
damn pity, got it?

126
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,350
If you tell me it doesn't
matter that I lost the money,

127
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:32,152
then why are you talking
about buying a new ship?

128
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,654
Just spit it out already.

129
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,756
If we can't afford the
repairs 'cause I screwed up,

130
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,557
then tell me!

131
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,259
Don't show me some
stupid catalogue

132
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:42,263
and change the subject!
I wanna know the truth!

133
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,530
The Merry can't be...

134
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:47,167
[loud wave crash
covers dialogue]

135
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,680
[USOPP]
Wha... What did you just say?

136
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,049
[LUFFY]
Don't make me repeat myself.

137
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,619
I told you, the Merry
can't be repaired any more.

138
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:10,791
No matter what we do,
we... we can't fix her.

139
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,495
Otherwise I wouldn't
say something like that.

140
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,596
You mean this ship?

141
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,565
This ship that we're riding
on right now is broken?

142
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,566
[LUFFY] That's right.

143
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,139
It's only a matter of
time before she sinks.

144
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,541
What're you talking
about Luffy? That's nuts.

145
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,076
[LUFFY]
No, I'm serious.

146
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,446
The shipwrights took a look
at the Merry themselves.

147
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,816
They said she wouldn't even
hold out until the next island.

148
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,586
[LUFFY]
And it's settled? So that's it?

149
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,721
A bunch of strangers tell
you to scrap your ship

150
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,723
and you don't even
ask any questions?

151
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,558
[LUFFY]
That's enough.

152
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,126
[USOPP] I understand
that these guys know

153
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:46,827
what they're talking about,

154
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,830
but this is just wrong.

155
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,132
Don't give up on the Merry!

156
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,501
What about all the adventures
we've gone on together?

157
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,670
What about all the
battles we've fought?!

158
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,140
She's our friend!
She's one of us!

159
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,343
Are you gonna abandon
her for another ship

160
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,644
without a second thought?!

161
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:10,084
After all we've been
through is that how little

162
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,586
the Merry means to you, Luffy?

163
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,659
I know you're upset Usopp,
but you need to calm down.

164
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,760
[USOPP]
Sorry, but no.

165
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:24,732
I'm not backing
down 'til we settle this.

166
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,299
Usopp, please.

167
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,273
What? So you know
better than the shipwrights?

168
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:35,175
If we had someone on the
crew who knew about this stuff,

169
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,411
we wouldn't have asked
them in the first place!

170
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,478
Then forget them!

171
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,448
We don't need those
guys telling us what to do.

172
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,385
I'll repair the Merry
myself, just like before!

173
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,386
We've made it this far,

174
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,688
so there's no reason why
we can't go on that way.

175
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,723
Here, I'll get
started right now.

176
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,492
C'mon guys, help me out.

177
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,360
That's not gonna work.

178
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,763
That's right, we don't
have enough lumber do we?

179
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,831
I'd better go buy
some at the shipyard.

180
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,667
We've got a lotta work to do.

181
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,369
You're not a shipwright,
Usopp, you hear me?!

182
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,104
Stop it, Luffy!

183
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:06,206
[USOPP]
Yeah, you're right! I know.

184
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,007
But so what?!

185
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,974
I don't see why
you're so hung up

186
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:11,078
on everything those
stupid shipwrights say!

187
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,079
If they knew what
she'd gone through

188
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,315
they wouldn't give up
on the Merry so easy!

189
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,783
They just want your money!

190
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,151
[NAMI]
Usopp.

191
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,218
[USOPP]
The Merry's our ship,

192
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,353
so it's our job to take care

193
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:22,189
of her without
someone else butting in!

194
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,624
I'm not giving up.

195
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:27,661
I won't let them take
the Merry away from me!

196
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,363
This is stupid.

197
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,831
You got fooled by
a bunch of salesmen

198
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,267
trying to pawn off a used boat.

199
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,602
The Luffy I know
wouldn't cave in

200
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,071
to some sales pitch
from a total stranger!

201
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,073
He'd believe in the
strength of the Merry

202
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,208
and the strength of his crew!

203
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,209
But here you are, acting like

204
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:45,312
you know everything and
ignoring your friends!

205
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,349
I can't believe that's the kind
of captain you turned out to be!

206
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:50,818
I thought you were
better than that!

207
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,120
You're not being fair,
Usopp. Luffy felt the--

208
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,590
You stay out of this!
It was my call. I stand by it.

209
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,292
There's nothing you can do.

210
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,128
We're getting a new ship
whether you like it or not.

211
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,130
This is the end of
the road for the Merry!

212
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,766
I'm not leaving her here.
I don't care what you say!

213
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,102
I know you're always trying
to think about the future,

214
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,371
but not everyone on
this crew is like that!

215
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,473
I see the Merry as one
of our friends, got it?!

216
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,508
And I won't abandon
her when she's hurt!

217
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,742
[LUFFY]
Don't be stupid!

218
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,245
Even if she is a friend, that
doesn't mean she's a person!

219
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,179
[USOPP]
She is to me!

220
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,814
And she still has
the strength to live!

221
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,048
But you wouldn't
appreciate that,

222
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,418
'cause all you care about is
getting a new ship to play with!

223
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,420
[SANJI] All right, that's
enough, both of you!

224
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,155
Just calm down and we
can settle this later!

225
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,723
[LUFFY]
Would you listen to yourself?!

226
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:30,991
Luffy!

227
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,093
Don't act like you're the only
one who's torn up about this,

228
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,528
we all feel the same way!

229
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,495
If that was true,

230
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,264
then you wouldn't be
looking for a new ship!

231
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,398
All right, fine!

232
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,100
If you don't like the way
your captain does things,

233
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,202
why don't you go
ahead and get off--

234
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,607
[CHOPPER]
Sanji!

235
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,449
This is going way too far!

236
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,685
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

237
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:58,719
If you don't watch it,

238
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,487
you're gonna say something
you can't take back!

239
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,122
So calm down!

240
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:15,603
Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't
know what I was thinking.

241
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:17,571
[USOPP]
You don't have to apologize.

242
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,107
'Cause that's how you
really feel, isn't it?

243
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,541
That's not true!

244
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,512
Just get rid of your dead weight

245
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,315
and move on before
they can slow you down.

246
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,453
[USOPP] If you're gonna
throw away the Merry,

247
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,788
might as well
throw me away, too.

248
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,309
Just get rid of
your dead weight

249
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:59,413
and move on before
they can slow you down.

250
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,316
If you're gonna
throw away the Merry

251
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,052
might as well
throw me away, too.

252
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,422
I know you're pissed off but
don't say stupid crap like that.

253
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,823
No, I'm serious.

254
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:14,128
I've been thinking about
this for a while now.

255
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,063
[USOPP]
It isn't like it was before.

256
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:20,501
You guys are just too strong
for me. I can't keep up anymore.

257
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,536
I mean, look at
what happened today.

258
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:26,140
You can't even trust
me with your money.

259
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,374
There's no point
in keeping me around

260
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,176
if all I do is
cause you trouble.

261
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,052
You don't want weak
people on your crew, do you?

262
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,286
Luffy,

263
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,223
I still believe that you'll be
the King of Pirates one day.

264
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,525
But as for me,

265
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:48,295
I'm just lucky I was
able to make it this far.

266
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,599
Even back when we first met and
I was going to set off alone,

267
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:55,536
you probably just invited
me on your ship out of pity.

268
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,271
[ZORO]
What are you talking about?

269
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:58,205
Get on already!

270
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,574
[LUFFY] We're friends.
Right? So get on.

271
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,680
That's the only
reason I'm here.

272
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,284
[USOPP] There's no sense
in travelling together

273
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,619
if we don't even
have the same goal!

274
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:17,224
[SANJI] Hey! Usopp,
where're you going?

275
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:21,328
[USOPP] Wherever I go,
it's my business.

276
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,496
It has nothing to
do with you anymore.

277
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,167
Sorry guys.

278
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,073
I'm leaving the crew.
This is goodbye.

279
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:40,680
♪ dramatic music ♪

280
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,360
Usopp, why?

281
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,195
Oh no.

282
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,766
Hey! Don't just
sit there, Luffy!

283
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,335
Who knows what he's
gonna do out there!

284
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,803
Go say something to him!

285
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,338
Stop him before it's too late!

286
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,178
[NAMI]
We've come too far together.

287
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,547
We can't part ways like this!

288
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,349
Usopp's not just a crew member.

289
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:19,186
He's one of our
friends too, isn't he?

290
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,321
[NAMI]
Get up and stop him!

291
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,093
Luffy, what's wrong? Please.

292
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,161
You're the captain, aren't you?

293
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:38,205
[NAMI]
Fine. Have it your way, then.

294
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,507
Usopp!

295
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,544
Get back here!
It shouldn't be like this!

296
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,246
C'mon! We can talk!

297
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,714
Yeah! Come back!

298
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,816
I want you to stay!

299
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:53,787
Don't leave us!

300
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,590
[CHOPPER]
Usopp! Please!

301
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,091
Say something.

302
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:27,221
[USOPP] Luffy. I'm sorry
I can't follow you anymore.

303
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,090
And I'm sorry I was a
pain 'til the bitter end.

304
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,128
[USOPP] I know you're
the captain of this ship,

305
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:38,299
so the Merry belongs to you.

306
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:42,068
That's why I want you to
fight me, Monkey D. Luffy.

307
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:52,646
[USOPP]
I challenge you to a duel!

308
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,056
Huh? Whoa, wait!
What are you saying?!

309
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:06,460
At ten o'clock tonight.

310
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:10,431
I'll be back. So you better
be ready for a fight, Captain.

311
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:13,667
I can't stop you from destroying
your own ship but if I win,

312
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,370
I'm taking the
Merry and leaving.

313
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,571
Either way.

314
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:20,674
When we're done, the last bond
between us will be broken.

315
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:30,184
What's with you?!

316
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,652
Would you stop this
nonsense already?!

317
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,487
Usopp just got worked up

318
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:37,157
because things were
moving too fast, right?

319
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,159
That's no reason to
fight with your own friend,

320
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,761
especially when he's hurt!

321
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:41,828
If you give it some time,

322
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:45,733
I'm sure both of you will
see how silly this is.

323
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:48,269
We've gone too far
to turn back now.

324
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,236
That's not true!

325
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,238
There's nothing stopping
you from apologizing

326
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,673
and talking it
over one more time!

327
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:03,384
Like I said, no turning back.

328
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,252
And why not?

329
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,122
Usopp is willing to
risk his life to fight me.

330
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:10,190
He's more than just angry.

331
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:13,560
Besides, if just talking it over
was enough to make things right,

332
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:17,097
we wouldn'ta come to
this in the first place.

333
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,432
That's all I have
to say, so goodnight.

334
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,803
Luffy...

335
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,004
[SANJI]
Think about it!

336
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:27,141
You said the Franky Family
came here this afternoon, right?

337
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:29,443
Yeah? So, what are
you trying to say?

338
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,111
If you hadn't let
them off so easy,

339
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,379
they would've have
stolen the money

340
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,614
from us in the first place!

341
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,683
It's your fault those
guys attacked Usopp!

342
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:38,085
He's just freaking out
'cause he feels guilty!

343
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,221
Hey! Don't go blaming me for not
kicking their asses hard enough,

344
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,223
you were the one who
ran off to go shopping!

345
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,526
What am I 'sposed to cook
if I don't have any food?!

346
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,261
[NAMI]
Both of you shut up!

347
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,228
Huh?

348
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:50,664
[NAMI] There's been
enough fighting already.

349
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,201
[NAMI] Whatever
happened, it's over now.

350
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:58,038
I know but this wouldn't be
happening if it wasn't for him!

351
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,444
Oh, hey. You're back.

352
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,779
You were going after
Usopp, weren't you?

353
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:11,418
Even if he was mad, I still
wanted to treat his wounds.

354
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,754
But he turned me away.

355
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:15,055
He found a place to stay.

356
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,791
So at least he
can get some rest.

357
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,261
But do you know
what he said to me?

358
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:22,129
He said we
aren't friends now.

359
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:26,566
So I should leave him alone
and go back to the ship.

360
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,374
Just this morning we were
all so happy and now what?

361
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:39,580
[NAMI]
We lost Usopp.

362
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:41,415
Robin's still missing.

363
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:44,752
I feel like if we
don't do something...

364
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:47,687
...the whole crew
is gonna fall apart.

365
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,633
[thinking]
Mmwell, the Straw Hats, huh?

366
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:06,473
I have a bad feeling about
tonight. I wonder what it is?

367
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,443
[LUFFY]
It's 10 o'clock.

368
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:11,778
Usopp'll be here
any second now.

369
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,592
Listen up! I don't want
any of you leaving the ship!

370
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,326
You got that?

371
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:33,300
Look!

372
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,569

That's perfect.
Don't go easy on me.

378
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:50,511
I won't be the
underdog this time.

379
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:54,548
In fact. I've already figured
out a way to defeat you.

You shouldn't be fighting!

383
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:19,133
[USOPP] As soon as we stop
working for the same dream,

384
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,302
we're no longer
friends! It's over!

385
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:24,471
[NAMI] Don't say that!
Luffy, talk some sense into him!

386
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,273
[LUFFY] Just sit
back and watch, Nami.

387
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:29,777
As a friend, you owe him
that much. Let's go, Usopp!

388
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,445
On the next <i>One Piece</i> :

389
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:35,416
"Luffy Vs. Usopp!
Collision of Two Men's Pride."

390
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:37,784
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
