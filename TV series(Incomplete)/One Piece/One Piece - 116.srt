What's going on around here?!
Don't play dumb with me, bird!

[SOLDIER B]
Cannons! Bring cannons in!

00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:48,474

[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
What a stubborn girl.

You're just wasting your

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,479
You know you haven't
got a chance.

193
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,481
I do too!

194
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,151

My Clima Takt!

197
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,758
But how? When'd you
take it from me?

198
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,328
I didn't. You dropped
it all on your own.

199
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,629
[NAMI]
Give that back!

200
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,297
Sure, glad to.

201
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,433
Though, I don't care
much for magic tricks.

202
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,368
See, I have enough power
to fight on my own

203
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,171
without needing a
hunk of junk like that.

204
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,810
Now be a good girl and
stay right where you are.

205
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,311
That way I'll be
able to kill you

206
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,782
without causing you
too much pain.

207
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:07,787

Am I gonna die like this?

00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:57,169
I am, aren't I? I'm gonna die.

00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,537

What's this?

00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:12,585
So, I'll kill you now, okay?

224
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:24,296
How is she doing that? And why?

00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:30,102
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
Hedgehog Stinger!

226
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,604
Too close!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait!

Hold on!

229
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,477
I said hold on! Just a minute!
Can't you give a girl a minute?

I'm not ready yet!
Come on! Cease fire!

00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,148
No fair! Time out! Stop!

00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,914
Well...

238
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,318
It looks like she's got a
little more battle experience

239
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,786
than I thought.

240
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,321
Not that it'll help.

241
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,822
[NAMI]
Where was it?

242
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,458
I saw it.

243
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,661
There was something
that looked useful

244
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,363
somewhere in these
Clima Takt instructions.

245
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,865
Dammit, where?

246
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,966
[USOPP]
That's it!

247
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,601
Next time you're at a party
and things are slow,

248
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,469
just use these little
tricks I've written up

249
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,305
and things'll really
start to jump!

250

People will love 'em!

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,679

00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,880
[USOPP]
Oh, by the way,

253
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,950
I've jotted down a few battle
configurations on the back.

254
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,685

On the back?

255
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,523

Hm?

00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,625
[gasps]

257
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,493
Let's see, where could you

258
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:05,464
be hiding yourself this
time, little kitty?

259
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:11,704
[NAMI laughing]

260
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,807
[NAMI]
I'm through running and hiding!

261
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,876
I may not look it, but during
my eight years as a thief,

262
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:22,648
I survived all kinds of
crises all by myself!

263
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,819
You can't treat me like
some ordinary girl.

264
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,988
Now bring it on, hussy!

265
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:32,324

Well, then. Show me
what you've got.

The battle configurations

269

of the Clima Takt!

270
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,603
First, understand the
characteristics of each section!

271
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,605
Each one can shoot
off air bubbles,

272
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,708
either by shaking or blowing!

273
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,910
The first shoots hot air.

274
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,682
[USOPP]
Heat Ball!

275
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,917
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
What's this? It's warm.

276
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,286
[USOPP]
Next shoots cool air.

277
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,556
[USOPP]
Cool Ball!

278
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,625
Ah, how pleasant.

279
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,261
[USOPP]
The last shoots electricity.

280
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,765
[USOPP]
Thunder Ball!

281
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,700
Oh, my, that tingled!

282
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:15,801
[USOPP]
Of course, these techniques

283
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,935
aren't quite finished yet,

284
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,772
so if you use 'em at parties,
you need to be careful.

285
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,608
Then why write 'em down?!

286
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,277
Look, are we done here?

287
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,383
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
Sewing Stinger!

288
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,285
Please, please, something
I can use for battle.

289
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,987
Not for parties,
some real techniques,

290
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,822
something I can fight with!

291
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,799
I'm sorry, girl, but I've
had enough of these games.

292
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,634
Stinger Step!

293
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,485
I see! The Heat Ball and
Cool Ball join together!

294
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,820
When they stop spinning,

295
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,522
the bubbles hit each other,
creating an air flow,

296
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,791
generating a powerful wind!

297
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,426
Brilliant, Usopp!

298
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,662
[USOPP] The Cyclone Tempo is
like an ordinary boomerang,

299
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,831
so if you take it outside
after the party to play with,

300
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:19,998
you have to watch out.

301
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:23,001
He really doesn't get it.

302
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,137
But let's see here...

303
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,705
Maybe I...

304
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,777
What kind of weapon is that?

305
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,650
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER] Don't you
dare turn your back on me!

306
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,655
To turn your back to your enemy
in the middle of a battle...

307
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,658
You didn't value your
life too highly.

308
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,035
[gasps]

309
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,740
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER gasps]

310
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,710
I changed the air density
by using a Cool Ball.

311
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,479
The temperature difference
caused a refraction of light

312
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,647
known as...

313
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,048
A mirage!

314
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:13,385
No way. At this distance?

315
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,558
[USOPP]
We can't win with power.

316
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,561
If we're gonna survive,
we gotta use our brains!

317
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:26,698
Heh. That's how we fight, right?

318
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,701
Used properly, this
can make miracles.

319
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,070
I'd say this is the
perfect weapon for me.

320
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,072
[growls]

321
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,944
Okay, Spiky. I'm ready.

322
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,113
Now why don't you give up?

323
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,352
No, Father!

324
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:54,393
[CHAKA] Let the king go,
Crocodile! At once!

325
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,928
Now, now.

326
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,396
After all the trouble
I went through

327
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,131
to immobilize him like this,

328
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,434
you really think I'm just gonna
turn around and let him go?

329
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:06,205
Use your head.
It's not gonna happen.

330
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,079
[COBRA]
Vivi, I'm sorry.

331
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,949
I failed you and the nation.

332
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,819
I didn't use the chance
you risked your life for.

333
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,788
Oh, Father.

334
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,897
Come on, is this the best you
can do after years apart?

335
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,068
Anyway, Miss Wednesday.

336
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,270
Don't call me that!

337
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,310
[CROCODILE] Let me tell
you a little something.

338
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:49,147
I have no intention of keeping
you or your father alive.

339
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,415
When a kingdom dies out,

340
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:54,920
it only seems natural its royal
family should die out as well.

341
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,122
Don't you agree?

342
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,860
But first, before
I take the throne,

343
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,429
there's something I need
to ask the current king.

344
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,099
If you have a moment, that is.

345
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:14,106
In fact, this has been my goal
from the very beginning.

346
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:19,144
Cobra, tell me,
where's the Pluton?

00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,812

348
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:33,458
