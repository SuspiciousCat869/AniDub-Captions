1
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,057
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,794
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,231
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:49,202
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,705
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,806
You can have it!

7
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,477
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,679
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:02,249
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,319
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,588
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,659
Hey. What's up?

13
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,661
We got bad news, Captain!

14
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,597
That stupid Grandpa of yours
came back for us, Luffy!

15
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,065
He's got a whole
bunch of Marines

16
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,366
on the other
side of the island

17
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,069
getting ready to hunt
us down and take us out!

18
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,804
[LUFFY] Huh? Why?

19
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,739
I thought he said
he was leaving!

20
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,508
[SANJI] We don't have
time to figure that out!

21
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,309
Just set sail!

22
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,481
Catch!

23
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,159
[LUFFY] Well? Come on!
Get on my ship!

24
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,127
Captain's orders.

25
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,764
"Your" ship already, huh?

26
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,633
An amateur like you
will probably sink her

27
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,101
in less than week.

28
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,803
You got the finest
vessel on the sea,

29
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:56,770
and no shipwright?

30
00:03:56,804 --> 00:04:00,074
That's a real pity.
For the ship, I mean.

31
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,308
What can I say?

32
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,576
You don't leave me much choice.

33
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,145
I gotta take care of my
masterpiece, after all!

34
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,747
So set sail!
I'm joining the crew!

35
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,187
[LUFFY] Departing
the City of Water!

36
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,590
Usopp Mans Up and Brings
Closure to the Duel!

37
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,461
[MARINE 323A] Vice Admiral Garp!

38
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,832
We have found the
Straw Hat Crew's location!

39
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:25,966
They're on Scrap Island!

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,601
[MARINE 323A] They're preparing
to depart as we speak,

41
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,403
so we don't have long, sir!

42
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,671
After 'em, men!

43
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,273
Everyone get on the ship!

44
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,607
--Yes, sir!
--Yes, sir!

45
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,117
Vice Admiral Garp,

46
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,686
after having such a
heartwarming farewell

47
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,154
with Luffy and his friends,

48
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,056
don't you think that
this is rather awkward?

49
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,258
Tell that to Sengoku, not me!

50
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,062
He's the one who got all pissy
and told us we had to come back!

51
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,529
Cocky bastard.

52
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,767
Should've known that
"I can't catch my grandson"

53
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,135
wasn't a good excuse.

54
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,270
Hey, shut yer trap, you rookie!

55
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,638
What do you know?

56
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,509
Uh, are you sure you want
to take a nap there, sir?

57
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,144
We're about to go to battle.

58
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,646
It'd be a pain to ride
to headquarters on my bike.

59
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,748
It's fine.
I'll stay out of the way.

60
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,585
Uh... Maybe you
should go inside?

61
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:20,454
Or even better,
you could help us fight.

62
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,023
[LUFFY] Set sail!

63
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:31,332
[FRANKY FAMILY
shouting goodbyes]

64
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,701
The Franky Family
will never die!

65
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:34,768
When you come back,

66
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,172
we'll be right here
waiting for you!

67
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,174
So that's it? We're leaving?

68
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,042
Luffy!

69
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,178
[FRANKY] Last call, Straw Hat.

70
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,045
Are you sure?

71
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,181
Seems like we're
still missing someone.

72
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,549
[LUFFY] Nah, it's okay!

73
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,783
We've waited long enough already

74
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,485
and he never
bothered to show up.

75
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,454
We went over this
back at Galley-La--

76
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,622
Everyone agreed on what to do.

77
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,529
So Usopp's really
gonna come back?

78
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,530
Uh-huh.

79
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,798
I saw him on the coast.

80
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,334
He was practicing
his big return speech.

81
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,740
That's great news!

82
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,742
Man, I was so worried!

83
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:17,177
Okay! Let's go
get him right now!

84
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,479
[CHOPPER squealing]

85
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,180
Well, that's Usopp for you.

86
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,548
Shoulda known.

87
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:25,219
[LUFFY] We're gonna
get our crew back!

88
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,087
All of you,
hold on a second!

89
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,058
[ZORO] I understand that
you want to see him again,

90
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,227
but I won't allow you
to bring him back here.

91
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,095
[LUFFY] Huh? Why not?

92
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,431
You can't kiss
his ass and tell him

93
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,766
you're happy to see
him again, you know that.

94
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:41,936
Zoro...

95
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,672
Until he bows his head and
apologizes for what he did,

96
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:45,773
he can't come back.

97
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,541
--Zoro! You big jerk!
--Hey!

98
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,376
I don't know what
your problem is, but--

99
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,477
Shut up!

100
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,148
[ZORO] It doesn't matter what
you two were thinking

101
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,416
when you started arguing,

102
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,320
and it doesn't matter who was
wrong or who was right, either.

103
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:02,122
[ZORO] When two men agree
to have a duel with each other,

104
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,525
no matter what the outcome is,
they have to accept it.

105
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,065
[USOPP] I know you're
the captain of this ship,

106
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,166
so the Merry belongs to you.

107
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,103
[USOPP] That's why
I want you to fight me.

108
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:19,573
But if I win, I'm taking
the Merry and leaving.

109
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,609
[USOPP] Monkey D. Luffy...

110
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:24,311
I challenge you to a duel!

111
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,449
[ZORO]
And after he lost that duel,

112
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,617
he left, by his own accord.

113
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,520
You understand, don't you?

114
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,690
He may be an idiot, but
this guy is still our captain.

115
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:37,891
[ZORO] We're better off
without a crew member

116
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:42,062
who doesn't respect their
leader when things get rough.

117
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,230
A crew with no respect

118
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,065
and a captain
that doesn't demand it

119
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,400
are destined
to fall apart quickly.

120
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,873
Listen!

121
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,042
I don't mind if you're
easygoing most of the time.

122
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,144
But right now, you gotta man up.

123
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,179
You can't let people
walk all over you.

124
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,046
'Cause if you do that,

125
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,349
it's gonna be me
who leaves this crew!

126
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,052
You're making this more
complicated than it needs to be!

127
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:08,221
Don't get me wrong,

128
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,257
it's fine if he
joins the crew again--

129
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,326
And it's fine
if you want him back.

130
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,193
But...

131
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,396
If he doesn't apologize
for what he did

132
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:18,465
and pretends like nothing ever
happened between the two of you,

133
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,568
then I won't forgive him
and I won't stand for it!

134
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:26,040
[ZORO] In other words, we'll
leave the island without him.

135
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,107
Wait, Zoro.

136
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:29,343
I agree that Usopp's
the one at fault, not Luffy,

137
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,678
but we can settle that with him

138
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,579
after the joins up
with us again.

139
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,685
[ZORO] So the fact that he
left our crew means nothing?

140
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,687
He can come and go
as he pleases?

141
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,590
No. But I--

142
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:43,623
[SANJI] Nami.

143
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,628
I hate to admit it,
but just this once, at least...

144
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,696
I have to agree
with what he's saying.

145
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,400
If he pulls a pointless
stunt like this on a whim,

146
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,035
then how are we
supposed to trust him

147
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,503
moving forward?

148
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,073
[ZORO] It's simple.

149
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,041
If the first thing that
comes out of Usopp's mouth

150
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,344
is an apology, then we're good.

151
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,613
But if he tries
to make some excuse,

152
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,148
then he's no longer
welcome here.

153
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,653
[ZORO] We're not just
pretending to be pirates.

154
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,487
This isn't a game.

155
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,433
[LUFFY] Do whatever
you want with the Merry.

156
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,105
I won't let anything
hold us back.

157
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:34,474
We're getting a new ship,
and sailing forward.

158
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,413
[LUFFY] So long, Usopp.

159
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:43,183
It was fun... while it lasted.

160
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,186
[LUFFY] You're right.

161
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,656
We already went our
separate ways before.

162
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,191
There's still a few days until
they finish with the ship.

163
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,260
We can wait that long.

164
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,195
It's all up to him.

165
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,800
We waited for him
for all that time,

166
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,102
but he never bothered to come.

167
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,404
So I guess we have our answer.

168
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,241
It's your call.

169
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,778
He'll be fine, and it's not
like he quit being a pirate.

170
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:11,845
It's a big world out there,

171
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,448
but I'm sure we'll run
into him again someday...

172
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,617
Even if he isn't
one of us anymore.

173
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,186
[laughing]

174
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,226
[USOPP]
I can do it! I can do it!

175
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,794
I'm joining the crew again!

176
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,331
[USOPP] I'm sure
the new ship is done by now.

177
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,766
Everyone must be waiting
for me to come back!

178
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,168
[USOPP]
I wasn't procrastinating.

179
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,036
I was waiting
for the perfect time!

180
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,638
Not that I'm going
to have a problem, anyway.

181
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,039
I've been training
day and night,

182
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,108
so I'm ready for anything!

183
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,576
But we are friends,
so just to be nice,

184
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,145
I'll try not to make a big
deal about how awesome I am.

185
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,481
"Since all of you are crying and
begging on your hands and knees,

186
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,784
I guess I'll make an exception
and come back as First-Mate."

187
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,688
"Oh, First-Mate Usopp,
you're the best ever! Yay!"

188
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,324
"We'll do anything you say,
as long as you come back!"

189
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,059
Or something like that!

190
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,629
See? I always
knew I was a genius!

191
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,331
I may fall down, but I
always get right back up!

192
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,066
[laughing]

193
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,368
After conquering adversity,

194
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:09,536
everyone will love the
brave hero Usopp even more

195
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,639
and we'll all live
happily ever after!

196
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,775
[USOPP] All right!
Full-speed ahead!

197
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,745
We've had some good times,
but this is farewell!

198
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,780
Thanks for having me, Water 7!

199
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,188
Usopp, c'mon!

200
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,125
Luffy, can we wait
a little bit longer?

201
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,427
We're not in a
rush just yet, right?

202
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,362
[NAMI] Hey! Luffy!

203
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,734
What was that?

204
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:45,138
Damn it!

205
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:47,607
Bad news! The Marines are here!

206
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,544
[LUFFY] Grandpa?

207
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,546
[FRANKY FAMILY SPLITHEAD]
It's Garp's battleship!

208
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,381
[FRANKY FAMILY SILVERHAIR]
Big Bro! Straw Hat!

209
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,049
You gotta get moving!

210
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,420
[GARP] Hey, Luffy,
can you hear me?

211
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:02,222
This is your Grandpa speaking!

212
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:05,125
Don't try to ignore me!

213
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,494
Yeah, I hear you!
What's the deal?

214
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,129
What're you doing
coming back here?

215
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,831
You said you were
gonna leave us alone!

216
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,733
[GARP] Yeah, well,
I say a lot of things.

217
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:16,036
Truth of the matter is, I'm
sending you to a watery grave.

218
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,738
What?!

219
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,707
I know this isn't
much consolation.

220
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,210
For what it's worth,
I'll fight you all on my own!

221
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,812
Cannonball, please.

222
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,147
Right! Coming up.

223
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,016
What's he trying to do?

224
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:38,225
[GARP] I call this one
my Meteor Fist!

225
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,639
He just threw that
with his bare hands!

226
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:54,275
That flew faster than any
cannonball I've ever seen!

227
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,443
And he pitched it
just like a baseball!

228
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:59,647
[laughing]

229
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,749
Those used to fly a lot
faster in my younger days!

230
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,285
Listen up!

231
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,353
We gotta get
out of here right now!

232
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,256
If we don't, he's gonna
wreck our brand new ship!

233
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,292
Now bring me a thousand
more, on the double!

234
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:12,726
[MARINES] Yes, sir!

235
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,529
All right, men!
You have your orders now!

236
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,798
Move!

237
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:18,932
This is bad!

238
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,135
Looks like there's plenty
more where that came from!

239
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,703
The Meteor Fist Shower?

240
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:23,403
Uh-oh.

241
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:25,539
Those guys are as good as dead!

242
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:29,009
Just one shot and their
ship is going up in smoke!

243
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:36,249
[knuckles cracking]

244
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:40,788
Now... I hope you're
ready, boys and girls.

245
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,389
[GARP] You can try
to run if you like,

246
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,591
but you ain't
getting away from me!

247
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,094
[LUFFY] Full speed ahead!

248
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,597
Everyone protect the ship
from those cannonballs!

249
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,730
[ZORO] Got it!

250
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,670
[SANJI] Damn it,
is he really not coming?

251
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,172
What is that idiot doing?

252
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,412
[sniffing]

253
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,080
He's here!

254
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:11,084
[CHOPPER]
Usopp came back after all!

255
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:13,587
You hear that, guys?

256
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,689
Usopp's right over there!

257
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:16,557
Are you sure?

258
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,591
[CHOPPER] Uh-huh!

259
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:22,229
[CHOPPER giggling]

260
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:56,463
[USOPP] Let me through!
Move, move!

261
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,565
I'm sorry, this is important!

262
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,568
Hey, what're you
doin', Long Nose?

263
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:02,536
Shouldn't you be on that boat?

264
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,542
Wait...
What the heck's going on?

265
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,079
Why are the Marines here
and why's Luffy leaving already?

266
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,048
You're really out of
the loop, aren't you?

267
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,649
[USOPP]
This has gotta be a mistake!

268
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,051
Sure, we had our differences,

269
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,153
but you can't really
be leaving without me!

270
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,188
They can't! They can't!

271
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,756
How can they do this?

272
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,291
We're still friends, aren't we?

273
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,460
We've been fighting
side-by-side all this time!

274
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,531
Sniper King.

275
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:31,565
[USOPP] Hm?

276
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,801
Shoot down that flag.

277
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,202
[USOPP] Roger.

278
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,304
[USOPP] This my new weapon,

279
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:40,107
a massive slingshot
by the name of Kabuto!

280
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,376
Behold its awesome power!

281
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:46,246
[USOPP] Special Attack
Firebird Star!

282
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:51,485
[KAKU] What the--?

283
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,420
[USOPP] Shing!

284
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,524
[ZORO] You are now a sword.

285
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,726
[USOPP] Someone get me a lawyer!

286
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,672
[USOPP]
You knew I was there, right?

287
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:12,706
After all that happened,

288
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,642
I may have worn that mask
to protect my pride,

289
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:16,443
but it was still me!

290
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:19,246
[USOPP] Did you give up on me

291
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,614
because we haven't
talked since then?

292
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,750
Is that it?

293
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,517
Come back!

294
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,555
[ZAMBAI] The stairs are
broken over there, you know?

295
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,723
Don't hurt yourself!

296
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,091
It's a misunderstanding!

297
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,525
It has to be!

298
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,763
Hey, look, everyone!

299
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:37,531
I'm right here!

300
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,400
Don't worry, I made it in time!

301
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:44,170
I'm coming back to the crew!

302
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,414
[USOPP] I'm not kidding!

303
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,285
Don't leave me here!

304
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:12,232
Now, Gum-Gum Balloon!

305
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,782
[CHOPPER] Usopp's here, Luffy!
It's not too late!

306
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,452
Everyone protect the ship!

307
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:37,725
[USOPP]
Hey! You should be happy!

308
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:39,360
Your friend Usopp's back!

309
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,762
So how 'bout the weather
we're having today, Chopper?

310
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,530
We should go fishing!

311
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,566
After the cannonballs
are gone, of course.

312
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:50,070
Oh, by the way,
I got some great news!

313
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,673
If you guys just turn around
and pick me up right now,

314
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:55,175
then I'll be happy
to be your Vice-Captain!

315
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,677
Good deal, huh?

316
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,381
Hey! Luffy! Guys!

317
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,082
It's okay!

318
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,817
I know you're nervous
about seeing me again,

319
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,619
but we're all buddies here!

320
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:06,487
C'mon!

321
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,589
It's not a big deal!

322
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:09,490
Luffy...

323
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:12,626
I'm sorry I can't
follow you anymore.

324
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:16,430
And I'm sorry I was
a pain 'til the bitter end.

325
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,632
[USOPP] Don't tell me
you actually believed that!

326
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,601
I was just kidding!

327
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:22,436
After all the stuff
we've been through together,

328
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:25,239
I wouldn't leave the crew over
something silly like that!

329
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:28,108
Sure, we had a little
disagreement, but we're friends!

330
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,744
And friends can put the
past behind them, right?

331
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,580
Hey! You hear me?

332
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,081
Say something, you guys!

333
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,428
[USOPP]
This isn't funny anymore!

334
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:01,108
Luffy!
Usopp's calling for us!

335
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,609
I can't hear him.

336
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,613
Zoro!

337
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,348
I don't hear anything!

338
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:09,683
[CHOPPER]
You liar! He's right there!

339
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,562
[USOPP]
You're serious, aren't you?

340
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:25,666
[USOPP]
I can't believe this.

341
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:28,468
You're really going
to leave without me, huh?

342
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:30,471
All right then.

343
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,038
Fine, I get it.

344
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,174
[USOPP] I know you're
always trying to think

345
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,141
about the future,

346
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,578
but not everyone on
this crew is like that!

347
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,780
I see the Merry as one
of our friends, got it?

348
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:42,682
And I won't abandon
her when she's hurt!

349
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:45,819
[USOPP] Just get rid
of your dead weight

350
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:49,390
and move on before
they can slow you down.

351
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,791
I've been thinking about
this for a while now.

352
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:55,296
[USOPP]
It isn't like it was before.

353
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:57,398
You guys are just
too strong for me.

354
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:59,432
I can't keep up anymore.

355
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:06,307
[USOPP] You don't want weak
people on your crew, do you?

356
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,541
Luffy...

357
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:11,712
I still believe that you'll be
King of the Pirates one day.

358
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:12,746
But as for me,

359
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,083
I'm just lucky I was
able to make it this far.

360
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:17,451
[USOPP]
Even back when we first met

361
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:19,386
and I was going
to set off alone,

362
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:23,256
you probably just invited me
on your ship out of pity.

363
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:30,097
That's the only reason I'm here.

364
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,498
[USOPP] There's no sense
travelling together

365
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:34,668
if we don't even
have the same goal!

366
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,070
[USOPP] Fine.

367
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:37,771
You've made your decision.

368
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:42,042
If that's how it is, then I have
only one thing to say to you.

369
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,812
[USOPP] Wherever I go,
it's my business.

370
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:47,447
It has nothing to do
with you anymore.

371
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,553
[USOPP] I'm leaving the crew.
This is goodbye.

372
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:07,534
I'm sorry!

373
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:11,739
I'm too stubborn, I know!

374
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:16,443
I take back every word I said!

375
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:18,645
[FRANKY] Hmph.

376
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:26,353
That's more like it.

377
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:30,090
[USOPP sobbing]

378
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,159
[USOPP] I know
I'm being pathetic.

379
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:34,661
I know I already said I quit.

380
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,566
But will you let me
take it back?

381
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,468
Please?!

382
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:45,139
I'm begging you!
You gotta forgive me!

383
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:48,342
[sobbing]

384
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,045
If I'm not with you,
there's no point!

385
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:55,649
Don't leave me alone!
I need you guys!

386
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:57,451
[USOPP] I'll do anything!

387
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,353
Please, let me join the crew.

388
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:02,589
Just one more time!

389
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:18,772
Luffy...

390
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:24,110
Hurry up! Grab on already!

391
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,616
[sobbing]

392
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:36,190
[sobbing]

393
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:37,724
You better not drop him!

394
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,230
Pretty lame, you two.
Pull it together.

395
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,338
[laughing]

396
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:56,143
All right!
The gang's all here!

397
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:58,445
We're gonna get away from
these stupid cannonballs,

398
00:22:58,478 --> 00:22:59,813
then head to the New World!

399
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:01,482
Let's go!

400
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:03,617
[ALL]
Yeah!

401
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:15,129
[NAMI] Well, Chopper,
it's all over for us.

402
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:17,398
We've both got bounties now.

403
00:23:17,431 --> 00:23:19,500
[CHOPPER]
I know! It's terrible!

404
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,268
Fifty Berries?

405
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:22,803
I'm a man, darn it!

406
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,338
[NAMI] What'll happen
when news of this

407
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:25,706
gets to Cocoyashi village?

408
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,708
Genzo and Nojiko
are going to freak out!

409
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,376
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

410
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,612
Wanted Posters Make It
Around the World!

411
00:23:31,645 --> 00:23:34,147
Celebration In Their Hometowns
as the Ship

412
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,584
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
