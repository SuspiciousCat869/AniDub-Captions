173
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,802
They're being set
up as we speak.

174
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,170
Any updates from HQ?

175
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,005
Admiral Kizaru is
on his way, sir.

176
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,307
But they're bringing in
the special vanguard.

177
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:11,310
What? You're kidding
me! They're coming?

178
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,044
Yes, sir.

179
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,747
At least, that's
what I was told.

180
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,682
[MARINE OFFICER 398B yelps]

181
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,870
[HACHI groaning]
[PAPPAGU whimpering]

182
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,744
I'm going to remove
your collar now.

183
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,712
Are you ready, young lady?

184
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,081
Whoa, now hold on!

185
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,851
Are you crazy?
You can't, It'll explode!

186
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,253
Yeah, it's true! We've
seen it happen before!

187
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,354
Stop! You'll hurt her!

188
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:58,190
Bad idea! Very bad idea!

189
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,959
Stop him! Please!

190
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,596
Hey, wait a second.

191
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:07,366
Isn't Franky off somewhere
looking for the key as we speak?

192
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,802
Why don't we just wait
for him to bring it back?

193
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:10,970
[PAPPAGU]
Yeah! He's right!

194
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,040
Luffy, please!
Don't let him do it!

195
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:20,913
[FRANKY grunting]
Oh, come on...

196
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,749
Aw, dammit! It's not
in here, either!

197
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,287
[FRANKY panting]

198
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,125
[RAYLEIGH] It'll be all
right. Just don't flinch.

199
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:42,768
[PAPPAGU sobbing]

200
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,272
I have no idea what kind of
power that guy used earlier...

201
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,851
[ZORO] But the one
thing I know for sure

202
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,853
is he's no ordinary man.

203
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,789
So that makes it okay
to risk Camie's life?

204
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,859
Dammit! Where's Franky with
that key? What's he doing?

205
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,961
[PAPPAGU]
I'm telling you, just wait!

206
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,097
This is a big mistake!

207
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:19,438
[ticking]

208
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,108
[PAPPAGU]
He set it off! It's gonna blow!

209
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,776
What are we gonna do?

210
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:24,944
[HACHI whimpers]

211
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,279
[CAMIE whimpers]

212
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,317
[ticking]

213
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,285
[PAPPAGU]
Stop it! You'll kill her!

214
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,186
[BROOK screaming]

215
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,123
[USOPP sobbing]

216
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,326
[PAPPAGU]
Camie!

217
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:46,132
[FRANKY panting]
Hold on, everybody!

218
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,967
Franky's on the way!

219
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,037
[FRANKY panting]

220
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,039
What happened?
Did something explode?

221
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:59,512
[PAPPAGU sobbing]
I told you! Camie, no!

222
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,584
[CAMIE gasping]

223
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,821
Don't scare me like that!
I thought I was too late!

224
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,556
Went to all the trouble
to find the key

225
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,424
and you don't even
need the damn thing!

226
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,327
[PAPPAGU whimpering]

227
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,401
It's off!

228
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,205
Camie!

229
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:31,944
[PAPPAGU grunting, whimpering]

230
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,412
[PAPPAGU]
Camie!

231
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,514
Thank goodness!

232
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,352
What the hell?
How'd you do that?

233
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,855
Look! These weren't
easy to find, you know.

234
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,559
Oh! Nicely done!
Better luck next time, then.

235
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,294
Here, carry her.

236
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,030
Camie. You're safe now.
Nothing to worry about.

237
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,898
How did you--

238
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,900
Uh, thank you!

239
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,370
What's going on here?

240
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,539
Look, man, I
appreciate the help.

241
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,442
But, seriously, who are you?

242
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,610
[PAPPAGU sobbing]
Camie!

243
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,546
What the--? How'd he do that?

244
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:13,686
That old geezer's got
some kind of freaky power!

245
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,042
Just who is he, anyway?
And where did he come from?

246
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,816
[PAPPAGU]
Stop it! You'll kill her!

247
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,589
Bare handed?

248
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,291
[FRANKY]
Hey! Today's your lucky day!

249
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,561
All the buyers took off.
Unless you like being a slave,

250
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,264
I'd get outta here while
you still can. Boom!

251
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:03,736
[SLAVES gasping, giggling]

252
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,071
[USOPP] That geezer took out
all these guards at once.

253
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,941
Like, by himself! He must
know how to use magic.

254
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,242
Maybe he's a sorcerer!

255
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,244
Well, whatever he is,
he's powerful.

256
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,980
And he said something
about Luffy's hat, too.

257
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,918
[RAYLEIGH]
That straw hat you wear?

258
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,121
It suits a fearless man
like yourself quite well.

259
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,957
Yes. I've wanted to meet you,

260
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,760
[RAYLEIGH]
Monkey D. Luffy.

261
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,194
[USOPP]
How do you know him, Luffy?

262
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,630
[LUFFY] I haven't even
met him. He just said.

263
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,867
I think he used
something called "Haki".

264
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,937
I've heard of it, but I've
never seen it used before.

265
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,941
Oh, I'm sorry about
that, everyone.

266
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,810
I didn't realize there were
other pirates here, as well.

267
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,212
You must all be quite strong
to withstand something

268
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,381
like that with no trouble.

269
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:53,852
Well, well. I never expected
to meet such a big-shot here.

270
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:57,356
"Dark King" Silvers Rayleigh.
You're a legend, old man.

271
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,992
What're you doing
in a place like this?

272
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:03,796
On these islands, I'm just
Ray, the coating craftsman.

273
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,198
Don't go around calling
me that other name.

274
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,900
I'm retired now.

275
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,336
I just want a quiet
and peaceful life.

276
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,638
Looks like you'll live, Hachi.

277
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,374
What did I tell you about
walking around this archipelago?

278
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,842
You gotta be more careful.

279
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,044
I know. I'm sorry.

280
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,980
Thank you. For everything.

281
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,148
I appreciate you
saving my friend here.

282
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:26,986
So, what was that about
you wanting to meet me?

283
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,221
Let's save that for later.

284
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,990
First, we need to
get outta here.

285
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,326
They've got us cornered from
every angle, boss. Got a plan?

286
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,396
[MARINE OFFICER 398B]
Testing 1, 2.

287
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,933
Alright, you criminals!
Release the Roswald family!

288
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,235
An admiral will be
arriving shortly.

289
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,438
I recommend you
surrender immediately.

290
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,675
And don't blame us for
whatever happens, you rookies!

291
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,349
[LAW] C'mon, we're just
innocent bystanders.

292
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,185
Why's the Navy treating
us like accomplices?

293
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,688
[KID] On the upside, I got
to see Straw Hat Luffy

294
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,123
do something crazy.

295
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,724
So no complaints there.

296
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,693
Still, I'd rather avoid
fighting an Admiral.

297
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,029
Sure. But if you're
expecting me to help,

298
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,198
I've used my power enough
today. It's all up to you now.

299
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,735
It'll be hard for me to stay
if the Navy discovers who I am.

300
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,872
I don't need a senior
citizen to fight for me.

301
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,807
The longer we wait,
the worse it'll get.

302
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,442
I'm out of here.

303
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,812
If you babies can't handle
a few Marines then sit here

304
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:31,417
while I show you how a real
man takes care of things.

305
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,053
[LUFFY] Look, I already
told you, I'm gonna do it!

306
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,154
[LAW]
Shut up!

307
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,755
[LUFFY]
I'm gonna take care of them!

308
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:37,823
[LAW]
Back off, will ya?

309
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,058
[KID]
I said I got it!

310
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,959
[LUFFY] Beat it, you two!
Leave this to me!

311
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,494
[KID] Get lost!
[LUFFY] I'm gonna do it!

312
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,396
[KID] Didn't you hear me?
Just go back inside.

313
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,131
[LUFFY]
You can't tell me what to do!

314
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,332
[LAW]
Why don't you settle down?

315
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,234
[KID] Why don't you
get out of my face?

316
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,803
[LAW] Somebody should
muzzle both of you.

317
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,071
[LUFFY]
Then it's settled.

318
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,907
All right! Go on
back inside, guys.

319
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,008
Weren't you listening?

320
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,111
I told you two to go
back inside first. I got this!

321
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,280
[LAW] Try to boss me
around like that again.

322
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,415
and you'll be the one I
cut down first, Eustass.

323
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,583
Get ready!

324
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,086
All three of these guys are
captains of their own crew,

325
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,854
and they're
spearheading the attack!

326
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,923
[MARINE 398D] Monkey D. Luffy,
worth 300 million!

327
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,491
I got this!

328
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,929
[MARINE 398D] Eustass,
Captain Kid worth 315 million!

329
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,298
I said I got this.

330
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,934
[MARINE 398D] Trafalgar Law,
worth 200 million!

331
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,938
Yeah, you two can keep
bickering. Meanwhile...

332
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,373
[ALL]
I'll handle this by myself!

333
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,111
[MARINE 398D] All 3 have
bounties way over 100 million!

334
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,114
[NAMI] Do all captains act like
children, or just those idiots?

335
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,282
Hey! It's gonna get
ugly out there.

336
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,118
Let's use this chance to escape!

337
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,787
Waiting around is
just plain crazy!

338
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,122
[CAMIE]
Hachin...

339
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,123
[CAMIE]
Thank you!

340
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,792
I'm sorry for causing
you so much trouble!

341
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,827
Oh, come on! Nevermind all that!

342
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,362
I'm just glad that
you're alright.

343
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,831
Camie. I should've
known better

344
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,833
than to let you go to
that amusement park.

345
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,403
It's my fault this
happened to you.

346
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,807
No, there isn't anything for you
to be sorry about, Pappagu.

347
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,810
I'll cherish the memory of that
Ferris wheel ride forever!

348
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,913
Straw Hat told me almost
the exact same thing.

349
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,316
[LUFFY]
What're you guys talking about?

350
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,918
[LUFFY]
Stop apologizing!

351
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,320
There isn't anything
to be sorry for!

352
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,422
All three of you
are my friends now!

353
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,526
I don't care what happened.
We're in this together.

354
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,362
And we're gonna rescue Camie
no matter what, okay?

355
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,997
Don't cry!

356
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,099
Luffy...

357
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,202
Follow them. Try to break
through in one shot.

358
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,370
That sounds like a plan.

359
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,505
[RAYLEIGH] If we happen to
get separated in the chaos,

360
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,841
lets meet up at Grove #13.

361
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,177
I know my way around.
Grove 13. Got it.

362
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,512
You'll be lucky if you find
your way out of the building!

363
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,581
Mister Giant! What about you?

364
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,184
All of us were on the
verge of becoming slaves.

365
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,286
Now, I'm gonna escape
somewhere with them.

366
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,453
[SLAVES cheer]

367
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,191
Very well. Try not to draw
attention to yourself, okay?

368
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,626
Old man! Straw Hat
and your crew!

369
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,096
I will repay the favor
if we ever meet again!

370
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,366
Thanks for everything!

371
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,536
Sure! It was no problem!

372
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,072
Huh? You're taking credit?

373
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:10,275
[MARINE 398E]
Mortars. Fire!

374
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,377
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

375
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,146
Balloon!

376
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,081
[MARINES shouting]

377
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,617
Repel!

378
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,285
[MARINES screaming]

379
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,254
Now Room...

380
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,224
Hey. What's up with
this circle-bubble thing?

381
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,092
...and Shambles.

382
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,060
[MARINES screaming]

383
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,931
[MARINE 398F]
You killed me! Wait. What?

384
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,399
[LAW chuckling]

385
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,136
[MARINE 398G] Watch out!
All three of them have powers!

386
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,906
Leave just enough marines
to rescue the hostages!

387
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,942
Bring the rest of our men here
and prepare mortars to fire!

388
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,079
[MARINE OFFICER 398B]
Ready!

389
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,148
Wait! Wait!

390
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,083
[LAW]
Huh?

391
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,284
[LUFFY grunts]

392
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,953
Don't either of you do anything.
You'll just get in the way.

393
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,256
Don't you dare put your
damn hand in my face.

394
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,324
[LUFFY]
Leave it to me!

395
00:20:59,358 --> 00:20:59,858
[BOTH grunt]

396
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,661
Get them! Open fire!

397
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,363
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

398
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,597
Finger Net!

399
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,431
He can stretch?

400
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,635
Guess so. What kinda
power is that?

401
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,604
[LUFFY yelling]

402
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,106
[BOTH gasp]

403
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,674
[KID, LAW gasp]
[MARINE 398F screams]

404
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,713
What the hell are you doing?

405
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,615
Wow. I thought I was a goner!

406
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,218
[LUFFY laughs]
Sorry!

407
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,487
Damn! You're really screwed up
in the head. You know that?

408
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,990
Start out by taking down
Straw Hat. Now charge!

409
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,125
[MARINES shouting]

410
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,560

412
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,033
[MARINE OFFICER 398B]
Damn, you! Fire! Fire!

413
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,968
[LUFFY grunting]

414
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,037
[MARINE OFFICER 398B]
We've got him on the run, men!

415
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,737
Go! Get him!

416
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,406
[MARINES yelling]

417
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,742
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Whip!

418
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,677
[MARINES scream]

419
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,512
[MARINE OFFICER 398B]
Stand firm! Fire!

420
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,417
My hat!

421
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,653
Whew, that was a close one!

422
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,588
[MARINE OFFICER 398B]
Don't let up! Keep after him!

423
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,258
[MARINES shouting]

424
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,659
[KID grunts]

425
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,495
[MARINES yelp]

426
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,099
What the heck?

427
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,500
What is he doing?

428
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,537
Does he have
a death wish?

429
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,105
Repel!

430
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,207
[MARINES yelp]

431
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,346
[MARINES shouting]

432
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,680
[MARINE OFFICER 398B]
I don't get it!

433
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,615
I thought these guys
were a bunch of rookies!

434
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,285
Status report! Has
Admiral Kizaru arrived yet?

435
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,519
Sir!

436
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,555
No news of Admiral Kizaru's
arrival, but we have attained

437
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,024
reinforcements from
the Navy post!

438
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,462
Wait a second!

439
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,130
What's going on?

440
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,531
Somebody help me!

441
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,632
[LAW]
Look at that.

442
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,702
There's a lot more of
these guys than I expected.

443
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,438
[LUFFY] Man, you guys sure
have some weird powers.

444
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,308
That rubber crap you
do is way weirder.

445
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,443
Huh. You think so?

446
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,893
[CHOPPER]
Yikes! Flying swords!

447
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,229
[BROOK] It would appear the
marines are flying around

448
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,097
as well in pieces! How gruesome!

449
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,433
[CHOPPER] Did he just make
a giant arm out of cannons?

450
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,835
[BROOK] I don't believe my
eyes -- not that I have any.

451
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,304
Kid and Law are certainly
powerful, aren't they!

452
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,440
[LUFFY]
Hey guys, save some for me!

453
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,175
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece.

454
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,410
"Break Through the Siege!

455
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,612

the Three Captains."

456
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:36,314
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
