WEBVTT

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.105
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.074
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.113
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.414
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.515
You can have it!

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.653
Now, you just have to find it!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.555
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.526
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:37.638
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:40.641
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.674 --> 00:02:45.846
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.982
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.015 --> 00:02:49.383
to ever chart these waters

00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:51.619
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:51.652 --> 00:02:53.520
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:53.554 --> 00:02:55.956
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.194
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.227 --> 00:03:03.297
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body became rubber

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.898
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.932 --> 00:03:08.602
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.636 --> 00:03:12.740
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.476 --> 00:03:17.444
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:20.214
Luffy and his crew arrive
on Fishman Island,

00:03:20.247 --> 00:03:23.984
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:24.018 --> 00:03:26.353
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones,

00:03:26.387 --> 00:03:31.225
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:31.258 --> 00:03:33.160
It's not long before
the Straw Hats

00:03:33.193 --> 00:03:34.662
get pulled into the conflict,

00:03:34.695 --> 00:03:37.831
and find themselves in the
midst of an all-out war!

00:03:37.865 --> 00:03:39.333
After a change of plans,

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:41.702
Hordy threatens to
crush the entire island

00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:45.339
under the weight of
a massive ship.

00:03:45.372 --> 00:03:47.141
[FUKABOSHI]
Erase our past!

00:03:47.174 --> 00:03:49.843
Set us back to zero!

00:03:49.877 --> 00:03:52.479
Eradicate the shadows
cast by our grudge

00:03:52.513 --> 00:03:54.748
so that we may see the light!

00:03:54.782 --> 00:03:59.787
All we can do is
start over! We must!

00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:04.358
Brother-hoshi.

00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:06.326
Just let me do this my way.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.529
Trust me.

00:04:08.562 --> 00:04:12.199
Our minds were made up as
soon as we got to the plaza.

00:04:12.232 --> 00:04:16.403
With Jimbei's help, we were
gonna save this island.

00:04:16.437 --> 00:04:19.339
Leave it to me and my crew!

00:04:19.373 --> 00:04:21.675
That's what friends
are for, right?

00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:29.116
[laughs]

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:30.484
Try your best,

00:04:30.517 --> 00:04:33.187
but I'll catch you long
before you reach the Noah!

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.755
What should we do, Luffy?

00:04:34.788 --> 00:04:36.056
You'll be okay!

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.091
Just follow my lead

00:04:37.124 --> 00:04:39.126
and I promise I won't
let Hordy hurt you.

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.028
Yes, right!

00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:48.802
[LUFFY] "Luffy's All-Out Attack!
Red Hawk Blasts!"

00:05:07.254 --> 00:05:10.124
[BROOK]
Wait, that's odd.

00:05:10.157 --> 00:05:13.093
Where'd that stripey fellow go?

00:05:13.127 --> 00:05:15.395
I've completely
lost sight of him.

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:18.732
Ahh... C'mon, where is he?

00:05:18.766 --> 00:05:20.734
[BROOK gasps]

00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:25.172
[ZEO chuckles]

00:05:25.205 --> 00:05:28.442
[ZEO]
Imbecile. I'm right here.

00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:31.578
But you'll be dead long
before you can notice!

00:05:31.612 --> 00:05:35.916
Now take this!
Camouflage Carpet!

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.017
[BROOK]
Huh?

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.720
Why did it sound like
the ground was talking?!

00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:43.657
[screams]

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.793
Wow, that's some good aim!

00:05:45.826 --> 00:05:48.228
Zeo!

00:05:50.497 --> 00:05:52.833
[ZEO]
You've fallen into my trap.

00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:56.303
Little did you know that was my
weapon-destroying technique,

00:05:56.336 --> 00:05:58.172
Body Sword Crush.

00:05:58.205 --> 00:06:00.607
Now the tip of your
sword has crumbled.

00:06:00.641 --> 00:06:02.209
It's worthless.

00:06:02.242 --> 00:06:03.510
No, I stabbed you.

00:06:03.544 --> 00:06:06.346
He really thinks he
can play it off!

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.548
[ZEO coughs]

00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:10.350
[ZEO] Your arrogance will
only lead to your defat--

00:06:10.384 --> 00:06:12.586
Uh, lead to your defeat.

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:14.188
Did he just...

00:06:14.221 --> 00:06:15.722
...say defat?

00:06:15.756 --> 00:06:17.624
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE C]
Shh! He'll hear you.

00:06:17.658 --> 00:06:19.827
Fumbled over your words
there a little, huh?

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.794
[ALL]
Hey!

00:06:20.828 --> 00:06:22.162
[growls]

00:06:22.196 --> 00:06:24.665
[ZEO]
Shut up, you dumb head!

00:06:25.632 --> 00:06:27.601
[BROOK]
Huh? What?

00:06:27.634 --> 00:06:30.237
I lost him again--
how does he do that?!

00:06:39.813 --> 00:06:41.648
[ZEO]
Hidden Flail...

00:06:44.651 --> 00:06:46.920
[ZEO]
...66 Neck!

00:06:52.326 --> 00:06:53.861
[ALL gasp]

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:03.303
[chuckles]

00:07:05.272 --> 00:07:10.043
[BROOK] I've learned something
in these past two years.

00:07:10.077 --> 00:07:12.846
I've come to an understanding

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.750
about the true nature of
the Revive Revive Fruit.

00:07:20.954 --> 00:07:24.691
[BROOK] When most people die,
their body is left behind

00:07:24.725 --> 00:07:28.662
while their soul continues
on to the next world.

00:07:28.695 --> 00:07:31.064
But my soul is different.

00:07:31.098 --> 00:07:33.800
In accordance with the
power of my Devil Fruit,

00:07:33.834 --> 00:07:36.136
it has been tempered like iron.

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:37.838
Radiating with strength,

00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:39.873
it maintains its hold
in this realm

00:07:39.907 --> 00:07:42.609
with a presence
that is palpable.

00:07:42.643 --> 00:07:46.513
That soul resonates through
the strings of my instruments.

00:07:46.546 --> 00:07:50.751
Rock and roll, screaming
from another dimension.

00:07:50.784 --> 00:07:52.853
Mesmerized by its melodies,

00:07:52.886 --> 00:07:56.757
the listeners dance their way
into a land of illusions.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.927
But when my soul flutters
away from this old body,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.462
it is no mere apparition.

00:08:02.496 --> 00:08:06.500
It can be seen as surely
as my rattling bones.

00:08:09.136 --> 00:08:13.407
[laughing]

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.942
[ZEO]
I did it!

00:08:14.975 --> 00:08:17.511
Popped his head right
off his boney neck!

00:08:17.544 --> 00:08:20.280
I killed a Straw Hat!

00:08:20.314 --> 00:08:26.320
[laughing]

00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:31.858
I'm fine.

00:08:31.892 --> 00:08:32.392
[yelps]

00:08:32.426 --> 00:08:33.827
[ALL scream]

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.232
[BROOK] You can chop me
up as much as you'd like,

00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:41.234
for it is neither
flesh nor organs

00:08:41.268 --> 00:08:43.270
that bind me to this world.

00:08:43.303 --> 00:08:47.074
So what is it that gives
me life, you might ask?

00:08:47.107 --> 00:08:49.176
It's my soul!

00:08:49.209 --> 00:08:52.813
[ZEO screaming]

00:08:52.846 --> 00:08:55.015
[ALL]
What?!

00:08:55.048 --> 00:08:56.750
[screams]

00:08:56.783 --> 00:08:58.151
[ZEO]
Huh? Uh.

00:08:58.185 --> 00:09:01.088
I killed him so hard it
brought him back to life!

00:09:01.121 --> 00:09:02.956
Man, I'm good!

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.625
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Are you for real?!

00:09:06.693 --> 00:09:09.229
[BROOK]
Is it starting to sink in yet?

00:09:09.262 --> 00:09:11.698
Keep it up, but none
of your attacks

00:09:11.732 --> 00:09:14.067
can damage these bones of mine.

00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:17.337
I'm already dead and you're
not going to kill me twice.

00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:20.207
[growls]

00:09:21.808 --> 00:09:26.446
Also... this blade I wield
is like none other.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.550
Sharpened by the Longarm Tribe,
and granted a befitting name:

00:09:30.584 --> 00:09:32.019
Soul Solid!

00:09:32.052 --> 00:09:35.856
Engrave that title
upon your heart!

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.195
[BROOK]
With a single soulful slash,

00:09:42.229 --> 00:09:44.197
it'll freeze you with
the frigid air,

00:09:44.231 --> 00:09:46.867
creeping from the
land of the dead!

00:09:49.302 --> 00:09:52.706
[BROOK]
As its icy grip claims you...

00:09:52.739 --> 00:09:55.342
...gaze upon it's bitter blade!

00:09:56.343 --> 00:09:58.912
Nice, Brook! That's awesome!

00:09:58.945 --> 00:10:01.748
You sounded like
a total badass!

00:10:01.782 --> 00:10:04.384
I'm a big Soul King
fan now! Oh, yeah...

00:10:04.418 --> 00:10:07.154
[BROOK] Goodness!
Well, thank you, Usopp.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.526
Ah! Oh, crap. Really?!

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:16.196
You'd think I would've learn
to keep my eyes on him by now!

00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:23.203
[chuckles]

00:10:23.236 --> 00:10:25.806
I guess I'd better step it up.

00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:27.641
The whole crew's looking good,

00:10:27.674 --> 00:10:30.243
showing off those skills they
learned for the New World.

00:10:30.277 --> 00:10:31.478
[laughs]

00:10:31.511 --> 00:10:33.346
It's real sweet to
hear how highly

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.449
you think of all your friends.

00:10:35.482 --> 00:10:37.651
But don't you worry,
since I'm such a nice guy,

00:10:37.684 --> 00:10:39.953
I'll make sure to drown
all of you together.

00:10:39.986 --> 00:10:41.288
Special Attack...

00:10:41.321 --> 00:10:44.057
Fireball Cutter... go!

00:10:45.592 --> 00:10:47.861
[USOPP]
Here comes Green Sta--

00:10:47.894 --> 00:10:49.930
[USOPP yelping]

00:10:49.963 --> 00:10:51.798
[DARUMA laughs]

00:10:51.832 --> 00:10:53.667
Green Star!

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.001
Green Star!

00:10:56.169 --> 00:10:59.739
And Green Star!

00:10:59.773 --> 00:11:01.708
Bouncing bastard!

00:11:03.076 --> 00:11:04.344
[laughs]

00:11:04.377 --> 00:11:06.379
I think it's safe to say
I found the weak link

00:11:06.413 --> 00:11:08.415
in the Straw Hat crew.

00:11:09.549 --> 00:11:13.019
All those shots and you couldn't
even hit me a single time.

00:11:13.053 --> 00:11:15.188
[laughs]

00:11:19.259 --> 00:11:20.994
[DARUMA]
Huh?

00:11:21.027 --> 00:11:22.963
Might wanna stay put,
mole shark.

00:11:22.996 --> 00:11:25.432
I'm a cookie-cutter shark, jerk!

00:11:25.465 --> 00:11:30.570
Whatever. I hope you enjoy
the trap I set for you.

00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:39.713
Look, Luffy! Hordy's
heading right for us!

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.682
[laughs]

00:11:42.716 --> 00:11:46.019
So you think you're gonna
protect everyone on the island?

00:11:46.052 --> 00:11:49.556
Well, let's see you try.
Show me what you got!

00:11:51.725 --> 00:11:53.593
[LUFFY]
Second Gear!

00:11:53.627 --> 00:11:58.064
And Gum-Gum... Jet...

00:12:02.002 --> 00:12:04.604
[LUFFY]
...Bazooka!

00:12:12.612 --> 00:12:16.149
[laughing]

00:12:16.183 --> 00:12:17.851
You call that a punch?

00:12:17.884 --> 00:12:19.486
Oh, Luffy.

00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:25.225
[HORDY]
It's pointless, Straw Hat.

00:12:25.258 --> 00:12:26.893
Don't you get it yet?

00:12:26.927 --> 00:12:30.363
The heavens endowed us with
this power--we can't lose.

00:12:30.397 --> 00:12:33.466
[HORDY laughs]

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.669
[HORDY]
Just lie down and give up.

00:12:35.702 --> 00:12:37.504
You can't stop the Noah now.

00:12:37.537 --> 00:12:41.241
And you'll watch every one
of your friends perish.

00:12:41.274 --> 00:12:44.411
Hell, no! I'm puttin' you down!

00:12:44.444 --> 00:12:46.613
Delusions of grandeur.

00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:49.282
Now die!

00:12:51.718 --> 00:12:54.120
[LUFFY]
Second Gear... Armament!

00:12:54.154 --> 00:12:59.159
[laughing]

00:13:00.727 --> 00:13:06.600
I swear I'll never let
anyone I love die again!

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.839
Now Gum-Gum...

00:13:12.872 --> 00:13:14.975
[laughs]

00:13:15.008 --> 00:13:17.811
C'mon, I'm gonna
bite your arm off!

00:13:20.814 --> 00:13:24.451
...Red Hawk!

00:14:09.763 --> 00:14:11.097
You did it, Luffy!

00:14:11.131 --> 00:14:12.832
Straw Hat.

00:14:24.577 --> 00:14:25.779
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
He...

00:14:25.812 --> 00:14:27.981
[ALL]
He won!

00:14:28.014 --> 00:14:35.322
[AMMO KNIGHTS laughing]

00:14:35.355 --> 00:14:37.090
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Straw Hat Luffy did it!

00:14:37.123 --> 00:14:39.726
He defeated the captain of
the New Fishman Pirates.

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:41.561
Hordy is down!

00:14:41.594 --> 00:14:44.397
He really did it.
He really stopped him!

00:14:44.431 --> 00:14:47.867
We're gonna be safe!

00:14:47.901 --> 00:14:49.903
Hey, this isn't over yet!

00:14:49.936 --> 00:14:52.372
Weepyhoshi, let's
get to the Noah!

00:14:52.405 --> 00:14:53.506
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Right!

00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:56.776
[LUFFY]
Full speed ahead!

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.445
Okay!

00:14:58.478 --> 00:15:01.147
What? That's impossible!

00:15:01.181 --> 00:15:03.817
Captain Hordy lost
the fight? But how?

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.854
You're kidding me!
What about the Noah?

00:15:07.887 --> 00:15:10.523
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE T]
Ah! This is the end!

00:15:10.557 --> 00:15:13.560
Everyone on the
island is doomed!

00:15:13.593 --> 00:15:14.861
Run for it!

00:15:14.894 --> 00:15:17.797
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.169
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES screaming]

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.475
Why, Zeo?

00:15:28.508 --> 00:15:31.845
The island's gonna get
crushed! Please let us go!

00:15:33.613 --> 00:15:35.915
[ZEO]
Don't you dare fall for it.

00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:38.418
You know the power
our captain has.

00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:40.387
He was chosen by heaven!

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.023
He could never be beaten by
some measly, pathetic human!

00:15:45.058 --> 00:15:46.292
But, I mean,

00:15:46.326 --> 00:15:49.696
we're not gettin' nothin' if
the Noah destroys this place!

00:15:50.864 --> 00:15:53.900
[ZEO] Death is only
another form of revenge.

00:15:53.933 --> 00:15:56.569
And we will die for
our hatred of humans.

00:15:56.603 --> 00:15:59.639
Our flesh and blood will be
remembered as a tragedy.

00:15:59.672 --> 00:16:02.909
And the grudge against humans
will grow ever stronger.

00:16:02.942 --> 00:16:05.678
We may fall, but thousands
more will stand up

00:16:05.712 --> 00:16:07.881
to take revenge in our name!

00:16:08.948 --> 00:16:12.485
[BROOK]
Oh, goody. There you are.

00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:13.787
You're all insane!

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.357
Not just Captain Hordy,
but all of you officers, too!

00:16:20.493 --> 00:16:21.528
Blame the humans,

00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:24.230
they're the ones who
made us this way!

00:16:24.264 --> 00:16:26.499
Don't run!

00:16:28.968 --> 00:16:30.603
Take that rage of yours

00:16:30.637 --> 00:16:33.506
and let it loose on
all of humanity!

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.141
They deserve your hate!

00:16:35.175 --> 00:16:38.244
Look around! Do you know
what they've done to us?

00:16:38.278 --> 00:16:41.915
They're the ones behind every
disaster the Fishmen have met!

00:16:43.416 --> 00:16:45.585
Is all that stuff
he's saying true?

00:16:45.618 --> 00:16:46.986
Are humans really that bad?

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.056
Huh? No way, that's ridiculous!

00:16:50.089 --> 00:16:53.426
I mean, sure, humans have
done plenty of awful things,

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.994
especially when you look
at their history with--

00:16:55.028 --> 00:16:55.895
[SHARLEY]
That's enough.

00:16:55.929 --> 00:16:58.164
[ALL]
Huh?

00:16:58.198 --> 00:17:00.033
[FISHMAN A]
Madam Sharley!

00:17:00.066 --> 00:17:03.069
You can see what's happening
with your own eyes.

00:17:04.604 --> 00:17:08.775
[SHARLEY] Just look on the
ground, and in the sky.

00:17:08.808 --> 00:17:13.313
The humans are fighting against
the New Fishman Pirates, for us.

00:17:21.421 --> 00:17:24.491
[FISHBOY B] What about
that guy? Is he human?

00:17:24.524 --> 00:17:27.060
[SHARLEY]
Their crew is a bit strange,

00:17:27.093 --> 00:17:29.829
but the important thing
is what they're doing.

00:17:29.863 --> 00:17:32.599
You must see things
for yourself.

00:17:32.632 --> 00:17:35.468
That's the only way
to understand the truth.

00:17:36.603 --> 00:17:39.372
No matter what you've
heard in the past,

00:17:39.405 --> 00:17:42.509
you must look at today
with an objective eye.

00:17:45.311 --> 00:17:47.614
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES scream]

00:17:47.647 --> 00:17:49.549
[ZEO] Even if you refuse
to fight to the death

00:17:49.582 --> 00:17:53.052
and try to run,
I'll kill you myself!

00:17:53.086 --> 00:17:55.955
Your hatred of humans
won't be wasted!

00:17:58.525 --> 00:18:00.226
[ZEO]
Huh?

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.464
They're your own people!
That's how you treat them?

00:18:04.497 --> 00:18:08.334
I almost died! Thank you so
much, Mr. Skeleton Mask!

00:18:09.736 --> 00:18:11.671
[ZEO]
You again, huh?

00:18:12.972 --> 00:18:14.140
You've never died,

00:18:14.173 --> 00:18:17.010
so don't talk like you
know anything about it!

00:18:17.043 --> 00:18:20.513
Die to leave your hate behind?
That's just absurd!

00:18:20.547 --> 00:18:22.549
There's nothing left
when you die!

00:18:22.582 --> 00:18:26.286
The only things left
behind are your bones!

00:18:26.319 --> 00:18:28.254
[FRANKY] The guy knows
what he's talkin' about!

00:18:28.288 --> 00:18:29.489
[BROOK]
Thank you!

00:18:29.522 --> 00:18:31.658
If there's one kind of
person I don't like,

00:18:31.691 --> 00:18:34.193
it's someone who doesn't
value the lives of others.

00:18:34.227 --> 00:18:36.329
I can't even stand their smell,

00:18:36.362 --> 00:18:38.598
and I don't have a
nose to smell them!

00:18:38.631 --> 00:18:41.000
[BROOK laughs]

00:18:41.034 --> 00:18:43.102
[chuckles]

00:18:43.136 --> 00:18:44.704
[ZEO] You and your
friends are the ones

00:18:44.737 --> 00:18:48.541
who don't value the
lives of others.

00:18:48.575 --> 00:18:50.944
I bet you all think you're
being bold and selfless

00:18:50.977 --> 00:18:52.512
by staying here to fight,

00:18:52.545 --> 00:18:54.847
but every last one of you
humans are gonna die

00:18:54.881 --> 00:18:56.716
when the Noah hits the island.

00:18:56.749 --> 00:19:00.720
Although I'm still not sure
whether you're human or not.

00:19:00.753 --> 00:19:02.622
I can promise you that
one of these days,

00:19:02.655 --> 00:19:05.758
our captain Luffy will become
the King of the Pirates.

00:19:05.792 --> 00:19:09.195
He is a man who keeps his
word, no matter the cost!

00:19:09.228 --> 00:19:12.332
So if he says that no harm
will come to the people here,

00:19:12.365 --> 00:19:14.901
then no harm will come.

00:19:14.934 --> 00:19:16.936
I believe in him no matter what.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.772
So that ship will never
touch this island.

00:19:19.806 --> 00:19:24.110
And now it's time for me
to step up and do my part.

00:19:24.143 --> 00:19:27.347
That means I won't let you
disappear before my eyes again,

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.116
even though I have
no eyes to speak of!

00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:33.319
[BROOK laughs]

00:19:33.353 --> 00:19:35.355
[WADATSUMI laughs]

00:19:35.388 --> 00:19:38.124
[WADATSUMI]
Well, how 'bout this?

00:19:38.157 --> 00:19:39.592
Impressed yet?

00:19:39.626 --> 00:19:41.894
[SANJI] Oh, sure,
that's pretty damn big.

00:19:41.928 --> 00:19:43.896
Yeah, impressive stuff.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.331
[laughs]

00:19:45.365 --> 00:19:46.966
[WADATSUMI]
Thought so!

00:19:48.267 --> 00:19:53.272
Well, then, do you wanna
wrap this up now, Jimbei?

00:19:53.306 --> 00:19:56.275
Yeah. It's about time.

00:19:56.309 --> 00:19:58.645
[HYOUZOU groans]

00:19:58.678 --> 00:20:00.213
[HYOUZOU]
Hey, not fair.

00:20:00.246 --> 00:20:03.850
You've destroyed
both of my swords.

00:20:03.883 --> 00:20:07.787
How can I win a sword fight
if I don't have swords?

00:20:09.088 --> 00:20:10.957
[ZORO]
Not my problem.

00:20:20.433 --> 00:20:23.036
[chuckling]

00:20:25.271 --> 00:20:27.373
[FRANKY]
All right, I'm goin' balls out!

00:20:27.407 --> 00:20:30.943
This new special move is gonna
take you down in a single shot!

00:20:30.977 --> 00:20:36.215
[USOPP] One, two, and on the
third step, it's all over.

00:20:36.249 --> 00:20:39.619
Think I'm kidding? Just try me.

00:20:39.652 --> 00:20:42.455
What kinda moron do
you take me for?

00:20:42.488 --> 00:20:44.590
I'm calling you out
on your stupid bluff.

00:20:44.624 --> 00:20:48.027
You're a weakling and
you'll always be a weakling!

00:20:48.061 --> 00:20:49.462
[USOPP]
You know, I used to lie

00:20:49.495 --> 00:20:51.964
about this kinda
stuff all the time.

00:20:51.998 --> 00:20:53.499
But now, it doesn't
really matter

00:20:53.533 --> 00:20:56.436
if you believe me or not.

00:20:56.469 --> 00:20:58.938
'Cause I know I'm the real deal.

00:21:05.678 --> 00:21:06.846
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:06.879 --> 00:21:09.215
Holy crap! What is that monster?

00:21:09.248 --> 00:21:12.118
Ah! Where did that
thing come from?

00:21:12.151 --> 00:21:13.986
Whoa, did he--?

00:21:15.121 --> 00:21:18.324
[CHOPPER roars]

00:21:18.357 --> 00:21:20.293
[USOPP]
No, not again!

00:21:20.326 --> 00:21:22.695
Huh? That runt?

00:21:22.729 --> 00:21:24.430
How'd he get so big?

00:21:24.464 --> 00:21:27.600
Whoa, pal. Easy, easy!

00:21:32.305 --> 00:21:35.007
[roars]

00:21:35.041 --> 00:21:38.978
Calm down, Chopper! You can't
lose control like before!

00:21:42.248 --> 00:21:44.383
[USOPP]
Huh?

00:21:44.417 --> 00:21:47.687
[laughs]

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.758
Don't worry, Usopp.
I know what I'm doing.

00:22:09.942 --> 00:22:10.910
[gasps]

00:22:10.943 --> 00:22:12.044
What's wrong?

00:22:12.078 --> 00:22:15.181
It's-- There! Look!

00:22:15.214 --> 00:22:17.283
It's Hordy!

00:22:26.025 --> 00:22:27.894
He can still stand?

00:22:32.331 --> 00:22:34.500
Are you ready?

00:22:34.534 --> 00:22:36.002
Let's go!

00:22:38.938 --> 00:22:40.306
[LUFFY]
I can breathe!

00:22:55.888 --> 00:23:01.894
[laughing]

00:23:13.072 --> 00:23:14.807
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hat
crew pushes forward

00:23:14.841 --> 00:23:17.009
with all their might,
aiming to end the battle

00:23:17.043 --> 00:23:19.545
with the New Fishman Pirates
once and for all.

00:23:19.579 --> 00:23:21.914
Horday takes more
energy steroids,

00:23:21.948 --> 00:23:24.584
robbing Luffy of time that
he can't afford to spare.

00:23:24.617 --> 00:23:27.153
Luffy, gravely injured
and running out of strength,

00:23:27.186 --> 00:23:30.723
struggles to overcome the
Fishman's superhuman stamina.

00:23:30.756 --> 00:23:32.391
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.425 --> 00:23:36.295
"Coming to an End! The Final
Decisive Battle against Hordy!"

00:23:36.329 --> 00:23:38.898
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
