00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,705
a father could ask for.

175
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,074
[CAROL]
I love you so much, Papa.

176
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,910
[USOPP]
What's with that girl?

177
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,012
[CAROL grunts]

178
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,181
But Papa, that silly
old man over there

179
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,850
was being mean and
trying to jack your present.

180
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,853
Now, now. Don't say "jack,"
dear. It's not right

181
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,689
for a proper young girl.

182
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,191
[USOPP]
Eek!

183
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,759
[DADDY] Are you
the gentleman that's been

184
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,195
bothering my adorable
little daughter?

185
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,532
Eh! No... I just...

186
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,799
[CAROL]
There's something else.

187
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,034
[DADDY]
Huh?

188
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,069
[CAROL whispers] There's a
bounty of 30 million berries...

189
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,705
[DADDY]
A bounty worth 30 million, huh?

190
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,806
[USOPP chuckles nervously]

191
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,542
[DADDY]
Let's take a look.

192
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,544
Oh. Are those the new bad guys?

193
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,979
Yeah, I just
picked them up today.

194
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,917
Six hundred...
One point three mil...

195
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,285
Seven hundred...

196
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,821
Ah. Thirty million...
Monkey D. Luffy.

197
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,892
For a first bounty,
that's impressive.

198
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,128
[DADDY]
Where are you going?

199
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,963
Okay. That's not me.

200
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,298
I'm not the guy in the poster.

201
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,733
I was just trying
to pretend to be a bad guy.

202
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,236
Bye bye now. I'm outta here.

203
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,272
Bye. See ya. Crap.

204
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,741
‐‐That's you.
‐‐[USOPP hollers]

205
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,243
Okay, you caught me again.

206
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,978
But just try and
lay a hand on me

207
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,146
and you'll see what happens.

208
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,081
My captain, Luffy,
won't sit idly by

209
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,916
and watch one
of his crew in danger.

210
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,785
He's a cold blooded
soulless demon

211
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,753
from the very pits
of hell itself.

212
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,990
You can't even imagine
the pain that he can inflict.

213
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,925
You've got your daughter
to worry about.

214
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,827
Why risk your life over it?

215
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,763
You're right. It's not worth it.

216
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,933
[DADDY] Anyone with
30 million berries on his head

217
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,936
is no ordinary man,
and that's for sure.

218
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,006
Papa. You can beat him;
you're the strongest man ever.

219
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,141
And you're not afraid of anyone.

220
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,611
[DADDY] Darling, I don't
have to prove anything.

221
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,714
I just need to get by
with enough to keep us happy.

222
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,215
So long as you think
I'm the greatest,

223
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,784
that's all that matters
to me. Understand?

224
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:19,952
Papa.

225
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,887
[USOPP]
I scared him off just like that.

226
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,690
I guess I don't know
how truly terrifying I am.

227
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,192
Time to flex.

228
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,060
I'm glad you came
to your senses, fool.

229
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,962
Now give me my goggles
and just maybe

230
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,031
I'll let you escape
with your life.

231
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,199
‐‐Huh?
‐‐[USOPP chuckles]

232
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,034
Don't worry;
I'm gonna pay for them.

233
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,803
I'm a killer, not a thief.
Now give 'em here.

234
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,639
He's letting you go, old man.

235
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,974
If I were you, I'd be
running for my life‐‐

236
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,343
‐‐Papa?
‐‐Okay, fine.

237
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,878
If that's how you want it,

238
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,314
then let's settle
this dispute like gentlemen.

239
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,750
‐‐Gentlemen?
‐‐[DADDY] Here.

240
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,353
A duel? Yeah.
I‐I think I can manage that.

241
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,323
If you win then
the goggles are yours.

242
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,258
[screams]
Two, three, four, six...

243
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,261
Thirty pistols!
[screams]

244
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,664
That's the same
number of guns as

245
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,265
Daddy the Father!

246
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,200
Yep, that's me.

247
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,451
[PASSERBY A]
It's Daddy the Father!

248
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,852
[PASSERBY B]
There's gonna be a duel!

249
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,954
[PASSERBY C]
Who could be that stupid?

250
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,091
Daddy... the Father?

251
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,093
Everybody knows
that Daddy the Father

252
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,096
is the greatest gunslinger
in bounty hunter history.

253
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,232
Not to mention he's
never lost a duel before.

254
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,735
So, what kind of idiot...

255
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,074
Oh, that kind.

256
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,742
[PASSERBY A]
Good luck, long nose!

257
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,745
[PASSERBY B] We got a hole dug
for ya already, so relax.

258
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,914
[chuckles]

259
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,782
[USOPP]
What the hell just happened?

260
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,984
Why am I dueling this guy?

261
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,121
[DADDY] Simple rules.
Walk ten paces and fire.

262
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,657
‐‐Okay.
‐‐What the hell are you doing?

263
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,058
‐‐[USOPP] Nami?!
‐‐It looks like you're facing

264
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,961
Daddy the Father
in a duel. Are you nuts?!

265
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:09,795
You're not helping!

266
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,964
You never have
anything nice to say!

267
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,967
You get one shot.
Are you ready?

268
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,680
One.

269
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,248
Two.

270
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,684
[CAROL]
Three.

271
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,819
Four.

272
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,855
Five.

273
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,656
[USOPP]
What am I doing? This sucks.

274
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,527
I'm so stupid.
There's no way I can beat him.

275
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,996
And Six.

276
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,531
[USOPP]
I'm gonna die now.

277
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,500
This can't be happening.

278
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,301
Seven.

279
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,271
[USOPP] I can't believe it.
My adventure is just beginning

280
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,306
and I'm already gonna die.

281
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,543
Who'da thought
it would come to this?

282
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,044
[CAROL]
Eight.

283
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,648
[USOPP]
Ciao!

284
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,183
[NAMI, CAROL gasp]

285
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,535
[CAROL] Papa! That was
awesome! You're the best!

286
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,203
That was just pathetic.

287
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,805
[PASSERBY B]
What a loser.

288
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,972
[PASSERBY C]
I don't think I've ever seen

289
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,809
such a cowardly move in my life.

290
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,680
I just shot
the coward's gun away.

291
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,682
What were you thinking‐‐
have you no shame?

292
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,150
Cheating during a duel.

293
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,553
You should be ashamed
of yourself‐‐it's pathetic!

294
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,054
[USOPP]
I'm so sorry! Forgive me!

295
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,356
I'm just really too scared
to die this young.

296
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,759
Killing me would be
too easy for you, right?

297
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,595
So, please don't shoot me.

298
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,897
You could just
let me go, couldn't you?

299
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,232
[USOPP hollers]

300
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,733
No, wait.

301
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,869
Nami. If you want money,
my friend here

302
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,904
has tons she can give you.

303
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,941
Please spare me.
I'm begging you, sir.

304
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,175
What the hell?

305
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,912
So, now you're
cowering behind a woman.

306
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,948
Listen...

307
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,017
No, leave her out of this.
She has nothing to do with it.

308
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,086
I'm the one that got
myself into this situation

309
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:17,189
and nobody can get me out it.
It's all on me.

310
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:17,957
Usopp.

311
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,959
Please, just leave
Nami out of it.

312
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,362
Usopp? Did she
just call you Usopp?

313
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,097
Yes.

314
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,699
‐‐Can't be...
‐‐[USOPP] Huh?

315
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,267
You wouldn't by
any chance know a man

316
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,937
by the name of Yassop of the
red haired pirates, would you?

317
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,940
Yassop...
That's my dad's name.

318
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,744
Uh! Wait, are you saying that
you and my father are friends?

319
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,981
So then you are his son.

320
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,282
Papa.

321
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,951
[birds chirping]

322
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,423
I met your dad.
And I've never spoken

323
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,994
a single word to anyone
about that fateful day,

324
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,296
‐‐until now, that is.
‐‐[USOPP] Huh?

325
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,100
We met in a hot,
dry port of call on a day

326
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,968
very much like today.

327
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,839
[YASOPP] C'mon ensign
Masterson! One shot each.

328
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,175
[PIRATE A]
One, two, three...

329
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:29,094
‐‐[YASOPP grunts]
‐‐[DADDY groans]

330
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,963
‐‐[PIRATE A] He won!
‐‐[PIRATE B] Yasopp won!

331
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:34,199
[PIRATE C] He beat the best
sniper the Marines have!

332
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,702
[PIRATE A]
Boy, that was a close one.

333
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,203
[PIRATE D]
You're the man, Yasopp!

334
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,805
Yeah.

335
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,175
All right! Finish him!

336
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,211
Killing the loser lets him die
with dignity and respect.

337
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,814
It's the right
thing to do, Yasopp.

338
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,322
Please. Finish me off.

339
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,191
There's no reason
for me to live anymore.

340
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:02,394
Yeah. You lost after all.

341
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,996
Huh?

342
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,033
[DADDY]
What are you doing?

343
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,702
[YASOPP]
Your daughter?

344
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:10,669
Give it.

345
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,304
I wouldn't expect
a cold‐blooded marine

346
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,807
like yourself to be treasuring
something like this.

347
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,375
Guess she must
be really special.

348
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,478
And what would a dirty
pirate know about it?

349
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,381
Not much.
[laughing]

350
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,483
[PIRATE A]
You were awesome, Yasopp!

351
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,419
[YASOPP] No, I wasn't. I wounded
him instead of killing him.

352
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,721
Still need more practice.

353
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,256
[PIRATE B] Maybe, but the rest
of us would have been killed.

354
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,226
You took on
Daddy Masterson and lived.

355
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,232
Thanks boss. Really.
I'm glad you let me duel him

356
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,002
instead of just
killing him on sight.

357
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,742
[YASOPP]
That hits the spot.

358
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,077
Hey, you want some marine?

359
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,080
[DADDY grunts]

360
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,782
[YASOPP]
Family, huh?

361
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,418
I could never wrap
my mind around that job.

362
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,120
[DADDY]
Is that so?

363
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,222
[YASOPP]
Y'know, I've got a son.

364
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,890
His name is Usopp.

365
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,759
Haven't seen him
in years though.

366
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,395
I left him for the sea
just when he started walking.

367
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:13,065
[DADDY]
Why? Didn't you love him?

368
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,867
[YASOPP chuckles]
It wasn't that.

369
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,069
I loved him plenty.

370
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,772
It's just that I loved
something else more.

371
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,940
The sea was calling for me.

372
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,375
[PIRATE D]
Amen, brother!

373
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:27,946
[PIRATE cheering]

374
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,815
[DADDY]
Mm.

375
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,118
[YASOPP yawns]
Now then...

376
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,455
It may be too late for me
to do anything for my son,

377
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,991
and I truly regret that,

378
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,794
but you... your daughter...

379
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,897
...she deserves to have
a parent with her by her side.

380
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,332
Don't ever let her go
while you have the chance.

381
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,134
Not that I'm the one to talk.

382
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:52,471
[laughing]

383
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,008
I lost our duel, Yasopp.

384
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,943
You can't leave me
here like this.

385
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,345
You owe that much to me.

386
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,281
[YASOPP] You Marines
may have to follow the rules

387
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,949
and do everything by the book,

388
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,018
but the best part about
being a pirate is that

389
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,756
I can do whatever I want,
whenever I want. Later.

390
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,874
So that's why you
left the Marines to become

391
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,944
a bounty hunter.
It all makes sense now.

392
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,613
Papa, no. A pirate
didn't spare your life.

393
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:38,150
Tell me it's not true.
Tell me you killed him, right?

394
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:41,353
Usopp! Wow! Your father
must have been amazing.

395
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,890
He beat Daddy the Father.
He hasn't forgotten you either.

396
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,392
Even now, as he's traveling
somewhere in the sea,

397
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,063
he has an image of his little
toddler boy that he left behind.

398
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,299
‐‐[USOPP sobbing]
‐‐[NAMI] Usopp?

399
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,002
[NAMI]
It's okay. We understand.

400
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,171
There's...
no way that you could.

401
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,473
That's not why I'm crying‐‐
there's more to it.

402
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,976
I get it. I understand
why you'd tell me

403
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,645
that story about my father.
You told me that

404
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,248
so I would try to be
more like him.

405
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,415
[CAROL]
Huh?

406
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,084
You embarrassed yourself for me.

407
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,919
You put yourself
beneath me so I would know

408
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,356
what type of man my father was.
I'll never forget that.

409
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,091
Most people would
just bury that story

410
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,059
and never tell it to anyone.

411
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,096
But you...
You're not afraid of anything.

412
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,064
Even shame.

413
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,034
A coward would never do
what you just did.

414
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,205
Carol, your dad
is the bravest man alive!

415
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,574
Men who are big and strong
are easy to find.

416
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,376
But the ones who
put their honor on the line

417
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,678
for others are one in a million.

418
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,683
I can't. If I accept
your dad's mercy,

419
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,451
it'll only bring him more shame.

420
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,421
I have one choice
and that is to face my death.

421
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,056
Give me another chance.

422
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,193
I have to prove to myself
that I am not a coward.

423
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,461
A life or death fight.

424
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,970
All right. Choose the weapon
you feel most comfortable with.

425
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,606
This will be our final duel.

426
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,144
Good. Now...

427
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:17,382
‐‐Let's see...
‐‐[bell ringing]

428
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,484
You must hit that weathervane.

429
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,320
What? That?

430
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,158
If you miss...

431
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,461
[USOPP] Right, you'll shoot me
through the heart.

432
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,129
[NAMI]
Usopp!

433
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:35,067
So this shot determines whether
I live or die with honor.

434
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,240
He can't.
There's no way he can

435
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,176
shoot that far with a slingshot.

436
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:51,350
[bell ringing]

437
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,364
[USOPP]
Relax. Concentrate.

438
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:15,507
[USOPP] It's just another shot.
Like a hundred before.

439
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,313
[USOPP grunts]

440
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,631
[NAMI]
You... missed.

441
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:43,235
Please don't kill him,
Papa. Please, no!

442
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,305
I can't shoot him
'cause he shot

443
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,573
right through the crown!

444
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,675
[gasps]

445
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,211
[NAMI]
You did it, Usopp! He's right!

446
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,212
Good job!

447
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,548
[DADDY] You're as good a shot
as your old man.

448
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,216
And a brave one as well.

449
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,085
Your father will be proud.

450
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:04,222
Go to the Grand Line.
You'll find him there.

451
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:09,494
[DADDY] He deserves to see
what his son has become.

452
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,063
[USOPP]
Daddy.

453
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,567
You're a pretty
good shot, old man.

454
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,402
Thanks.

455
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,670
[CAROL]
Later!

456
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:19,838
Wait, Papa!

457
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:24,843
[DADDY] Now Carol, don't say
"later." It's bad manners.

458
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,179
[CAROL giggles]
Sorry, Papa.

459
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:30,349
I'm gonna try to be a nice
little girl from now on.

460
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,752
[DADDY] My little angel,
you're nice enough.

461
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,455
[CAROL giggles]
Well, I'm gonna be even nicer.

462
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,256
[NAMI]
When people say Daddy the Father

463
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:43,128
is a disgraced marine, at least
we'll know the real story.

464
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,797
My father will see me
as a true warrior someday.

465
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,900
You'll see. I'll be as brave
as Daddy the Father.

466
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:53,438
And I will make my father proud.

467
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,440
[USOPP]
I know it.

468
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,809
[CARMEN]
Sanji! I finally found you

469
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,811
after ten years.

470
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,551
<i>All that's in my heart</i>
<i>confuses me</i>

471
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,553
<i>I cannot understand</i>

472
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,655
<i>As I face what I must do</i>

473
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,425
<i>I'll say goodbye</i>
<i>and squeeze your hand</i>

474
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,227
<i>I'll set sail alone</i>

475
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,463
<i>But always know</i>
<i>I'm gonna keep you near</i>

476
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,232
<i>As I drift away</i>

477
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,802
<i>I pray you watch me</i>
<i>as I disappear</i>

478
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,675
<i>As I watch the sunrise</i>

479
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,245
<i>I began to wonder</i>

480
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:37,949
<i>What could be the reason</i>
<i>It's so hot inside</i>

481
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,419
<i>No answer has come</i>

482
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:44,489
<i>But I can't get away</i>
<i>from what's true</i>

483
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:49,361
<i>It's because of you</i>

484
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,596
<i>Show me how to</i>
<i>catch those feelings</i>

485
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,266
<i>Get 'em to come back to me</i>

486
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,767
<i>I'll do what I must</i>

487
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:59,204
<i>Because they're</i>
<i>everything I wanna be</i>

488
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,339
<i>Wrap these arms around my dreams</i>

489
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,842
<i>And pull 'em back from yesterday</i>

490
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,344
<i>If I'm holding hands with you</i>

491
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,181
<i>I'm sure that we can</i>
<i>make the way</i>

492
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,991
[USOPP] They're saying
there's a cooking contest!

493
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:23,695
[SANJI] Huh? My food isn't
meant for competition.

494
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,965
It's meant to be placed
delicately in the mouth of Nami.

495
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,300
[NAMI]
Thanks, Sanji.

496
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,801
[ZORO]
What? You're not gonna enter?

497
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,403
[LUFFY]
You get that if you win, right?

498
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,573
[SANJI] Wait, that's...
a blue‐finned elephant tuna.

499
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,374
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

500
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:40,245
"Fiery Cooking Battle?
Sanji vs. the Beautiful Chef!"

501
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,547
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
