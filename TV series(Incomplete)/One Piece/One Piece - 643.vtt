00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.330
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:42.905
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.749
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:40.655
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:45.865
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:48.370
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:51.644
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.677 --> 00:02:53.480
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:55.886
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.924
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.233
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.869
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:08.610
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.644 --> 00:03:12.885
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:16.894
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.927 --> 00:03:18.831
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:21.235
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.974
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:26.847
Devil Fruit Factory in the
kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.686
Soon, Luffy becomes
sidetracked by a tournament

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.992
with the Flame Flame Fruit
as a prize.

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:36.432
Meanwhile, Sanji finds that
their deal with Doflamingo

00:03:36.465 --> 00:03:38.302
was nothing more than a setup.

00:03:38.336 --> 00:03:40.574
Listen up!

00:03:40.608 --> 00:03:43.948
Let me spell it out!
We walked straight into a trap!

00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:48.524
You know why I went to
so much trouble, Law? Huh?

00:03:48.557 --> 00:03:53.099
No secret. I just really
wanted to kill you.

00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:34.883
Joker! Make him pay
for this! Save me!

00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:37.421
There's no way in hell
you're getting Caesar back now!

00:04:37.454 --> 00:04:38.891
You and I had an agreement!

00:04:38.924 --> 00:04:42.532
You can't just do what you want!
The deal's off, Doflamingo.

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:45.103
You're going to
regret this decision.

00:04:45.136 --> 00:04:46.907
Hey moron, just because
you're screwed,

00:04:46.941 --> 00:04:48.778
doesn't mean you have to
drag me down with you!

00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:50.179
[laughs]

00:04:50.213 --> 00:04:53.153
We've hardly spoken in ten
years, and this is how you act?

00:04:53.186 --> 00:04:56.326
Treat your old boss nicer,
won't you, Law?

00:04:56.359 --> 00:05:00.401
Caesar is very valuable to me,
I need to have him back.

00:05:00.434 --> 00:05:02.204
[CAESAR CLOWN babbling]

00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:04.475
Issho. It would appear that Law

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.780
brought Caesar Clown
here for a tradeoff.

00:05:06.813 --> 00:05:08.951
[FUJITORA] Ah, the scientist
that caused the poison gas

00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:13.026
incident. A heinous crime.
Still, we'll see.

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:15.330
If he works for one of
the Seven Warlords,

00:05:15.364 --> 00:05:18.069
he'll get amnesty. Tricky.

00:05:18.102 --> 00:05:22.478
[chuckles] Hello there.
You're the famous Vice Admiral

00:05:22.512 --> 00:05:26.520
who got recruited in the World
Military Draft, aren't you?

00:05:26.553 --> 00:05:28.423
Fujitora, was it?

00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:31.630
They say you and Vice Admiral
Ryokugyu are both forces

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:33.634
to be reckoned with
on the battlefield.

00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:35.905
Sir. You flatter me.

00:05:35.938 --> 00:05:39.045
[DOFLAMINGO] Heh. You can
spare me the humble act.

00:05:39.078 --> 00:05:40.280
[FUJITORA]
Then I'll be frank.

00:05:40.313 --> 00:05:43.186
I'm having some trouble
unraveling this situation.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.560
Y'see, I don't have much
experience as a Marine,

00:05:46.594 --> 00:05:50.133
so I don't want to make any
baseless accusations.

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:52.238
But it seems to me,
as a Warlord,

00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:54.275
you're doing some things
that step outside

00:05:54.308 --> 00:05:56.980
of your boundaries, just a bit.

00:05:57.014 --> 00:05:58.784
For example,
the fellow over there

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.555
just referred to you as "Joker."

00:06:00.588 --> 00:06:02.324
A rather troubling implication.

00:06:02.357 --> 00:06:03.359
[yelps]

00:06:03.392 --> 00:06:06.465
[chuckles] If you want
to dig into my past,

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.537
you'd better be willing
to get your hands dirty,

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.044
'cause it'll take a mountain
of evidence to topple me.

00:06:12.077 --> 00:06:14.148
Speaking of naughty Warlords,

00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:17.254
what's the Navy going
to do about Law?

00:06:31.684 --> 00:06:33.988
You're referring to the
news about his alliance

00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:36.025
with the infamous
pirate Straw Hat.

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:39.131
If the reports are true,
then I'm afraid he's guilty.

00:06:39.164 --> 00:06:42.972
So, tell me, Law.
Is he simply your subordinate,

00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:46.079
or is he an ally,
and you're guilty?

00:06:46.112 --> 00:06:48.049
[LAW grunts]

00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:52.024
What comes next depends on
your answer. If you've betrayed

00:06:52.057 --> 00:06:54.495
your position, we'll
have to arrest both you

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:56.900
and the Straw Hats
for your crimes.

00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:58.003
[MARINES gasping]

00:06:58.036 --> 00:07:00.541
What kind of half-assed
decision is that?!

00:07:00.574 --> 00:07:03.781
All he has to do is lie
and you let him go scot free?

00:07:03.814 --> 00:07:06.252
[LAW]
My plan fell completely apart.

00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:09.091
The Navy shows up
and now I'm the target.

00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:14.302
[LAW] I can't let the team in
Dressrosa be affected by this.

00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:16.940
I'm gonna have to
make a stand on my own.

00:07:16.973 --> 00:07:18.544
Lying won't help.

00:07:18.577 --> 00:07:21.550
It's true! The Straw Hats
aren't working under me!

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:24.321
We're equals in this alliance!

00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:28.731
[laughs] Just can't take
the easy way, can you?

00:07:28.764 --> 00:07:32.938
Well... That's it.
Your title is revoked.

00:07:32.972 --> 00:07:35.878
But that might not be
the only headline tomorrow.

00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:05.036
No way!

00:08:07.976 --> 00:08:09.211
A meteor?

00:08:09.244 --> 00:08:11.549
That-- That can't be right!

00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:16.760
That's a bit overkill,
don't you think?

00:08:16.793 --> 00:08:18.163
[MARINE B]
It's a meteor!

00:08:18.196 --> 00:08:20.567
[MARINE C]
Run for it! He's serious!

00:08:26.312 --> 00:08:27.548

00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:38.490
[MARINE A]
I... can't see what happened.

00:09:38.524 --> 00:09:40.159
[MARINE B]
Where's Issho?

00:10:03.406 --> 00:10:07.313
Joker! Seems they survived.
Though I can't say how.

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:25.550
[MARINE D]
The only thing left

00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:30.561
are the spots
they're standing on!

00:10:30.595 --> 00:10:31.563
[gasping]

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:33.667
This is just unreal.

00:10:35.403 --> 00:10:37.173
Is this how the Navy acts now?!

00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:39.846
Show some restraint!
Are you insane?

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.219
Even a blind man won't miss
with an attack that big.

00:10:43.252 --> 00:10:48.029
Ah, pardon me.
Just a small test.

00:10:48.062 --> 00:10:50.100
Now, Law. You're a criminal.

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:53.439
Therefore, I'll be
arresting you now.

00:10:53.472 --> 00:10:54.676
[LAW grunts]

00:10:54.709 --> 00:10:56.245
What now, Law?

00:10:56.278 --> 00:10:58.717
You aren't thinking about
running away, are you?

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.789
Because you won't get far,
here in my kingdom.

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:08.036
[SANJI] Flower Field?
You going on a picnic?

00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:11.910
[FRANKY] You're one to talk.
Where the hell have you been?

00:11:11.944 --> 00:11:15.050
I was... falling in love!

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:17.153
Aww, well, ain't that sweet.

00:11:17.187 --> 00:11:20.527
Oh, hey. I think I can
find the factory, easy.

00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:21.630
[SANJI]
For real?

00:11:21.663 --> 00:11:23.801
Yep. Problem is,
we can't just wreck it

00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:25.805
and haul ass outta here.

00:11:25.838 --> 00:11:29.311
It's gonna be a whole thing.
A whole big thing.

00:11:29.344 --> 00:11:30.079
[SANJI]
Huh?

00:11:30.112 --> 00:11:31.683
Hey, you filthy little thief,

00:11:31.717 --> 00:11:36.058
I told you, we don't take
credit! Somebody stop that toy!

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:38.429
He took my burgers
and didn't pay!

Get back here!

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:48.717
We'll be lucky just to
make it out alive, now!

00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:51.221
Yeah. I heard about
Doflamingo's trap.

00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:53.326
Man, we walked
right into that one!

00:11:53.359 --> 00:11:55.463
But just 'cause our fancy
plan went off the rails

00:11:55.496 --> 00:11:57.969
doesn't mean we can't do some
damage while we're in town.

00:11:58.002 --> 00:11:59.237
I got somethin' brewing here

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.442
that might salvage
this operation.

00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:02.711
It's complicated.

00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:05.183
Just meet me at the Flower Field
and we'll work things out.

00:12:05.216 --> 00:12:06.920
What the hell is that
place, anyway?!

00:12:06.953 --> 00:12:09.024
It sounds like something
out of a fairy tale!

00:12:09.057 --> 00:12:12.297
By the way, I'm getting
worried about Nami.

Come on!

Nami's tough as nails.
She'll be fine! Have some faith!

Besides, she's got Brook and
Monster Chopper with her too.

Uh, somethin' up?

What're they watching there?
That screen.

A broadcast from the Colosseum.

on quite a show today!

Franky, I found Luffy,
and he's, uh...

00:12:43.827 --> 00:12:46.465
Uh-huh. Yeah, he's fighting
in some big tournament,

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:48.069
I forgot to tell you that.

00:12:48.102 --> 00:12:49.939
Why didn't you do
anything to stop him?

00:12:49.972 --> 00:12:51.776
You can't trust him on his own!

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.048
[FRANKY] Hey, you're in
no position to judge me!

00:12:54.081 --> 00:12:58.489

finding him again!

Doflamingo's secret factory,
right? I have a map.

00:13:08.777 --> 00:13:12.117
It's disguised. It looks like
a toy house on the exterior.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.354
But that's your target.

there's no turning back!

know that I betrayed the family.

[CROWD gasping]

00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:35.149
Amazing!

00:14:35.183 --> 00:14:37.521
They're just thugs.
Why'd you need me?

00:14:37.554 --> 00:14:39.793
[KIN'EMON] They are holding
my dear friend Kanjuro hostage,

00:14:39.826 --> 00:14:42.497
so I was rendered helpless!

00:14:42.531 --> 00:14:45.203
Speaking of which, I am
in dire need of your aid!

00:14:45.236 --> 00:14:47.173
We must make haste
to the Toy House!

00:14:47.207 --> 00:14:49.579
I have heard word that
this is where the fiends

00:14:49.612 --> 00:14:52.718
are holding Kanjuro,
but I don't know the way.

00:14:52.751 --> 00:14:54.622
Sure. You got it.

00:14:54.655 --> 00:14:55.857
[KIN'EMON grunts]

00:14:56.993 --> 00:14:59.565
[GYATS] We don't know where
he came from, but Lucy

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:02.571
certainly seems to be going
places in this competition!

00:15:02.604 --> 00:15:06.512
[CROWD cheering]

[LUFFY grunting]

00:15:14.094 --> 00:15:16.365
C'mon! Bring it! Who's next?

00:15:16.398 --> 00:15:18.904
[COMPETITORS groaning]

00:15:18.937 --> 00:15:22.878
[LUFFY] Oooh, there's somebody
tough over there. Who is it?

00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:30.493
The bull? He's that strong?

00:15:30.528 --> 00:15:32.865
[roaring]

00:15:57.615 --> 00:16:00.921
Good! You wanna
fight with me next?

00:16:00.954 --> 00:16:03.860
[BULL growls]

00:16:03.894 --> 00:16:06.833
Uh-oh! Looks like he's
set his sights on Lucy!

00:16:06.866 --> 00:16:10.841
Will Lucy's luck come to an end
at the horns of Brutal Bull?

00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:13.914
Just the other day, Bull
faced off against a mob

00:16:13.947 --> 00:16:17.621
of death row prisoners
in this very arena!

00:16:17.654 --> 00:16:19.659
[PRISONER A] All I gotta do
is butcher this cow

00:16:19.692 --> 00:16:21.562
and they'll set me free? Easy!

00:16:21.595 --> 00:16:24.935
[PRISONER B laughs] Pretty
generous offer, I gotta say!

00:16:24.969 --> 00:16:28.877
I've killed more men than I
can count. This is nothing.

00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:31.248
Outta my way, I'm gonna
take the sucker down!

00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:34.487
Me first! [yells]

00:16:36.926 --> 00:16:42.203
[PRISONERS groaning, yelling]

00:16:42.237 --> 00:16:43.974

[screaming]

00:16:57.601 --> 00:16:59.137
[GYATS]
It was a massacre!

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.210
Not one man walked away,
and more than half of them

00:17:02.244 --> 00:17:04.715
got a one-way ticket
to an early grave!

00:17:04.749 --> 00:17:08.288
That's why Brutal Bull is known
as the Colosseum's Grim Reaper!

00:17:08.322 --> 00:17:09.926
A cyclone of death!

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:13.031
[roars]

00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:17.541
[GYATS]
He's charging straight for Lucy!

00:17:17.574 --> 00:17:21.883
But Lucy isn't budging an inch!
Has he lost his mind?

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.688
Could it be...
he's paralyzed with fear?

00:17:24.722 --> 00:17:29.030
Here come the horns!
He'll tear right through him!

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.453
[LUFFY]
Hey. Over here.

00:17:40.486 --> 00:17:42.023
[BULL growls]

00:17:42.057 --> 00:17:46.097
[GYATS]
Somehow... Lucy dodged!

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.839
Come on! One more! [laughs]

00:17:49.872 --> 00:17:52.143
[BULL growling]

00:18:03.099 --> 00:18:04.500

[CROWD murmuring]

00:18:30.253 --> 00:18:33.793
[GYATS] B-Brutal Bull
stopped dead in his tracks!

00:18:33.826 --> 00:18:37.735
What sort of sorcery
is Lucy working here?

00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:43.279
[laughs] Hey, let's be friends.

00:18:43.312 --> 00:18:45.483
No one can stop us now!

00:18:45.517 --> 00:18:46.686
[roars]

00:18:46.719 --> 00:18:50.794
I can't believe it! He's tamed
the Grim Reaper itself!

00:18:50.827 --> 00:18:55.436
Let's hear it for
the one and only Lucy!

00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:57.006

[DWARF J gasping]

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.447
What the heck's
going on up there?

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.283
[ROBIN]
It must be Law.

00:19:21.656 --> 00:19:23.225
[screams]

00:19:23.259 --> 00:19:26.198
This sucks! If the roof caves
in, then we're all gonna die!

00:19:26.232 --> 00:19:27.167
[DWARVES]
Whoa!

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.671
Even the hero is scared now?

00:19:35.751 --> 00:19:39.291
Kidding! That earthquake
was caused by me!

00:19:39.324 --> 00:19:41.094
Or my Haki!

00:19:41.128 --> 00:19:43.666
Haki? That's how you
beat up all 50,000

00:19:43.699 --> 00:19:46.472
of those bad guys back
on Fishman Island, right?

00:19:46.506 --> 00:19:48.710
So awesome! That's our hero!

00:19:48.743 --> 00:19:50.413
[DWARVES gasp]

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:53.085
You're so strong you can shake
the whole kingdom, huh?

00:19:53.118 --> 00:19:55.489
Try this, Hero!
A delicious gift!

00:19:55.523 --> 00:19:57.326
A big piece of Fighting Fish!

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.099
They're like goldfish,
only angry!

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:01.067
Those big guys?

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.369
[LEO]
Yep!

00:20:04.373 --> 00:20:07.313
Wow! Didn't think
it'd be so good!

00:20:07.346 --> 00:20:09.652
It's almost as tasty
as Sea King!

00:20:09.685 --> 00:20:13.058
Which I dine on all
the time, of course.

00:20:13.092 --> 00:20:14.394
[USOPP]
I see...

00:20:14.428 --> 00:20:18.402
So they're the ones who nabbed
that thing back on the bridge.

00:20:18.435 --> 00:20:20.774
These little guys
must be crazy strong!

00:20:20.807 --> 00:20:22.209
Glad they're on my side!

00:20:22.243 --> 00:20:24.548
Since we're small, just one
of those Fighting Fish

00:20:24.581 --> 00:20:27.086
could feed the whole kingdom
for a month or even more.

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:29.423
You big people have to
eat an awful lot, though.

00:20:29.457 --> 00:20:31.529
That must be a real
pain sometimes.

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:33.131
Uh?

00:20:33.164 --> 00:20:35.603
[USOPP] For Luffyland in my
Usolanders Fighting Force,

00:20:35.637 --> 00:20:39.111
a fish like this
is just a snack.

00:20:39.144 --> 00:20:40.914
[DWARVES gasp, murmur]

00:20:40.947 --> 00:20:42.416
What's Usoland?

00:20:42.449 --> 00:20:44.922
That statue.
Look familiar to ya?

00:20:44.955 --> 00:20:46.324
[ROBIN]
Huh?

00:20:48.864 --> 00:20:52.203
From that picture book
we read back in Jaya.

00:20:56.846 --> 00:20:59.952
Leo. Is that Noland?

00:20:59.986 --> 00:21:01.589
[LEO]
Uh-huh!

00:21:03.092 --> 00:21:05.997
I see! Of course!
You know him, don't you?

00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:07.901
He was the big
person botanist

00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:10.974
who came to visit our
kingdom 400 years ago.

00:21:11.008 --> 00:21:12.477
Our hero!

00:21:12.511 --> 00:21:14.447
Back then, there were
a bunch of bad guys

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:15.650
messing up our home,

00:21:15.683 --> 00:21:17.855
but Noland rushed to
the aid of our ancestors

00:21:17.888 --> 00:21:19.591
and saved the day!

00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:21.829
We'll never forget the
debt we owe to Noland,

00:21:21.862 --> 00:21:23.767
no matter how many years pass!

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.506
The Tontatta will
always honor him!

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:29.110
When Usoland mentioned
the hero's name,

00:21:29.143 --> 00:21:32.217
and told us he was one of
his descendants, I just--

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.087
I was so overwhelmed!

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.526
[USOPP] No, I mean it!
Look at my helmet!

00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:39.565
It's shaped like a chestnut,
just like his head!

00:21:39.599 --> 00:21:40.567
[FLAPPER]
He's right!

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.237
[DWARVES]
A chestnut-head!

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.711
We tied you up!
It's awful! I am so sorry!

00:21:45.744 --> 00:21:47.213
You're shameless.

00:21:47.246 --> 00:21:50.520
Don't complain.
It saved you, too.

00:21:50.554 --> 00:21:52.356
Just keep quiet,
enjoy the feast,

00:21:52.389 --> 00:21:54.427
and then we'll get outta here.

00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:57.400
Truly, it must be an act of
fate that brought you here.

00:21:57.434 --> 00:22:00.206
And today, no less.

00:22:00.239 --> 00:22:01.909
[LEO grunts]
Yes, I agree.

00:22:01.942 --> 00:22:04.113
After 400 long years
have passed,

00:22:04.147 --> 00:22:07.119
a legendary hero comes
before us once again.

00:22:07.153 --> 00:22:11.996
On the very day that we vowed to
go to war against Doflamingo!

00:22:12.029 --> 00:22:12.931
[USOPP grunts]

00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:14.500
[KABU] Usoland!
After you finish eating,

00:22:14.535 --> 00:22:16.071
we'll take the
underground passage

00:22:16.104 --> 00:22:18.142
to the Flower Field and prepare!

00:22:18.175 --> 00:22:20.179
[DWARVES]
Now's the time!

00:22:20.212 --> 00:22:22.818
Yeah!

00:22:22.851 --> 00:22:25.523
[LEO] The captain and his
Riku Royal Army are waiting

00:22:25.557 --> 00:22:29.063
for us in Dressrosa, where
the final battle will be waged!

00:22:29.097 --> 00:22:31.268
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:35.242
Please, take the lead!
Usher us to freedom!

00:22:35.276 --> 00:22:38.482
Together, we'll crush
the Don Quixote Family!

00:22:38.517 --> 00:22:41.088
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:22:41.121 --> 00:22:43.358
[LEO]
With Usoland, we're invincible!

00:22:43.392 --> 00:22:44.695
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:22:44.728 --> 00:22:46.699
Give him a cheer!

00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:50.774
[DWARVES] Usoland! Yeah!
Usoland! Yeah! Usoland! Yeah!

00:22:50.807 --> 00:22:54.848
Usoland! Yeah! Usoland! Yeah...

00:22:54.882 --> 00:22:56.619
[ROBIN]
Oh, boy.

00:22:56.652 --> 00:22:58.890
[DWARVES]
Usoland! Yeah! Usoland! Yeah!

00:22:58.924 --> 00:23:03.098
Usoland! Yeah! Usoland! Yeah!
Usoland! Yeah! Usoland! Yeah!

00:23:03.132 --> 00:23:08.809
Usoland! Yeah! Usoland! Yeah!
Usoland! Yeah! Usoland! Yeah...

00:23:13.553 --> 00:23:16.559
[NARRATOR] Lucy continues his
valiant run atop Brutal Bull.

00:23:16.592 --> 00:23:19.397
Just then, another warrior
appears to challenge him.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.571
His name is Hajrudin,
a fierce pirate mercenary

00:23:22.604 --> 00:23:24.809
who hails from Elbaf's
newest generation.

00:23:24.842 --> 00:23:26.478
Now, an epic showdown begins

00:23:26.512 --> 00:23:29.751
between Lucy and the
would-be king of all Giants!

00:23:29.785 --> 00:23:31.723
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.756 --> 00:23:35.329
"A Blow of Anger!
A Giant vs. Lucy!"

00:23:35.362 --> 00:23:38.068
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
