1
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:36,122
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,793
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,527
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,530
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,931
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,935
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,536
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,439
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:55,275
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,844
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,512
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:02,516
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,452
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:08,789
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:11,992
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:16,596
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,502
[NARRATOR] Unable to save Ace's
life during the War of the Best,

18
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,172
the injured Luffy was
taken to Amazon Lily,

19
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,807
where he fell into despair.

20
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:31,412
But this is a story from ten
years ago, in the East Blue,

21
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,147
when Ace, Luffy,
and their friend Sabo

22
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,349
made a promise to each other
that they would become pirates.

23
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,420
Sabo, whose parents are
members of the nobility,

24
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:43,123
was kidnapped by his father
and forced back to High Town,

25
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:47,161
while his friends in
Gray Terminal could only watch.

26
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:50,297
I'll do whatever
you want me to, okay?

27
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,933
I'll live whatever
life you've mapped out.

28
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:57,071
Just please, I'm begging you,
don't hurt my friends!

29
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,106
They've done nothing wrong.

30
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,076
I can't stand this.
Those two are my brothers.

31
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,410
[gasps]

32
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,646
[NOBLE F] It's important that
we all keep our mouths shut.

33
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,983
Think, what would happen if
someone outside of High Town

34
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,251
found out about the plan?

35
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,119
[SABO gasping]

36
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,887
[NOBLE F]
You and I are special!

37
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,056
We come from
great noble families.

38
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,124
[SABO screams]

39
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:26,399
Luffy! Ace! Get away!

40
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:33,940
[LUFFY] "The Fire Has Been Set!
The Gray Terminal in Crisis!"

41
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:36,810
Hold on!

42
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,979
Wait a minute, kid!

43
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,081
[NOBLE E]
Of course I know about the fire.

44
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,383
Why? What's wrong?
Did they cancel it?

45
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,520
[NOBLE SOLDIER A] Bluejam
and his men have been placing

46
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:50,090
explosives all over Gray
Terminal, just like we asked.

47
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:50,757
[SABO grunts]

48
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,358

[SABO groans]

50
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,330
Oh, my, are you all right?

51
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:56,997
[SABO]
Outta my way!

52
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,198
[CITIZENS gasp]

53

[SABO grunting]

54
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:05,005
I have to tell them!

55
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,807
[SABO groans]

56
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,244
Boy, where are your parents?

57
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,313
Learn some manners!

58
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,782
There's no time! [gasps]

59
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,050

Settle down, kid!

60
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,618
[COP B]
Yeah, just relax!

61
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,622
Ace! Luffy!

62
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,623
[ACE]
Huh?

63
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,792
We're burning down
Gray Terminal?

64
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,760
But why the hell would
you wanna do that?

65
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:27,995
[BLUEJAM]
Not so loud!

66
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,963
We gotta keep quiet about this.

67
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,066
If anyone finds out,
it won't work.

68
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,300
You really are a meanie,

69
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,035
I knew we shouldn't
have trusted you!

70
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,937
We gotta hurry and tell
everyone we can, Ace!

71
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,973
I told you to keep quiet.

72
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,441
Hey. Shut 'em up.

73
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:41,909
[LUFFY, ACE grunting]

74
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,478
[BLUEJAM] I'm just following
orders, same as you.

[ACE gasps]

76
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,214
[BLUEJAM]
In case you didn't guess,

77
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,316
all those boxes you've
been lugging around

78
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,919
are filled with explosives.

79
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,587
You get it?

80
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,790
Nothing will survive
that fire and no one.

81
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:57,892
[LUFFY gasps]
But...

82
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,426
Bluejam, don't do it!

83
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,129
[laughs] Since when
did you brats

84
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,898
start giving a damn
about other people?

85
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:08,335
Well, now that you know
about the grand plan,

86
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,105
you're stuck here.
We can't risk letting you go.

87
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:12,706
Sorry.

88
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,310
Actually, there's something I've
been meaning to ask you boys.

89
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:19,179
Heh. So, tell me.

90
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,614
Is it true that you brats

91
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,217
are hiding treasure
somewhere around here?

92
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,819

Sabo! You've caused us
nothing but disgrace!

From now on, I'm through
with your antics!

00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,199
I was right to adopt
another child!

Please, I gotta go warn them!

Everyone in Gray Terminal
is going to die!

[MAN B, MAN C]
Huh?

110
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,570
Something weird is
happening in Gray Terminal.

111
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,071
That looks like fire.

00:07:54,442 --> 00:07:58,745

would turn out to be this fun?

All right, what's the big deal?

It's the sky! Look!

117
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:07,888
Is that the town?

[BANDIT C]
No, it's closer than that!

119
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,958
I think it's Gray Terminal!

120
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:11,925

has never caught fire before.

about the living garbage
stinking up Gray Terminal,

do this for me,

well, you won't need a hideout.

00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,941
On to the Great Gate!
The military is waiting for us!

178
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,342
[BLUEJAM PIRATE E]
Captain, we left those

179
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,810
two brats in the hideout.

180
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:44,845
[BLUEJAM]
Forget 'em.

181
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,446
They had their chance to join up

182
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,783
when I asked them where their
treasure was, but they blew it.

183
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,887
[BLUEJAM] Fools like them
aren't gonna live long, anyway.

184
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,791
[ACE grunting]

185
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:57,725
[BLUEJAM PIRATE F]
Captain!

186
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,326
The gate is already closed!

187
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,527
[BLUEJAM]
It's nothing.

188
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,029
They just don't want
other people to break in

189
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,297
and cause a riot.

190
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,733
I'm supposed to give them
a sign once we're here,

191
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,234
then they'll open it up.

192
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,071
It's me, Bluejam. We're here.

193
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:14,709
Huh?

194
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,444
Hey! Open the damn gate!

195
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:21,147
Captain?

196
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:24,918
You don't... think...

197
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,188
Hey! Come on!

198
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:28,755
What the hell are you doing?

199
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,058
This isn't funny! Open the gate!

200
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,292
We made a deal!

201
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:35,028
You're supposed to let us
evacuate from this pit!

202
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,098
Quit screwing around
and let us in!

203
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,033
You bunch of bastards!

204
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,867
The king made me a promise!

205
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,203
If we burned down the terminal,
he'd make us nobles!

206
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,339
Don't tell me he--

207
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,908
[gasps] The king set us up!

208
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:51,111
That liar! Dammit!

209
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,714
[CITIZEN A]
Did you hear?

210
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,115
They found out
who started the fire.

211
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:58,685
It was some pirate named
Bluejam from Gray Terminal.

212
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,953
[CITIZEN B]
How despicable!

213
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,256
A criminal turning
on his own men!

214
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,357
I bet he was trying to keep

215
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,092
the World Government's
observers away

216
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,094
so he could keep on
terrorizing people.

217
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:08,996
Gosh, what an evil pirate!

218
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,497
[ACE panting]

219
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,133
[LUFFY crying]

220
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:16,070
It's way too hot, Ace!
I think I'm gonna melt!

221
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,437
The hell you are!

222
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,806
Damn! Why did Bluejam
rope us into this mess?

223
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,477
[LUFFY yelling] We can't get
away! I don't wanna die!

224
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,078
If you don't stop complaining,

225
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,514
I'll kill you!

226
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:28,015
[LUFFY]
It's not that hot.

227

[ACE, LUFFY panting]

228
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,852
[LUFFY] Whoa, I'm burning!
I mean this isn't so bad!

229
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:32,786
[ACE]
It's all over the place!

230
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,489
[coughs] I can barely breathe.

231
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,990
I mean, I'm cool!

232
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,126
The fire will kill us all!

233
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,528
We're gonna be fine.

234
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:42,529
Don't worry!

235
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:44,831
We'll live, somehow.

236
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,634
[SABO'S DAD]
Someone call the police!

237
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,068
Sabo did it again!

238
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,670
[SABO'S MOM]
Hello, police?

239
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,471
Anyone? Hello?

[NOBLE SOLDIER E]
Hey, are you nuts?

242
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:57,811
You're going the wrong way!

What are you talking about?

00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,585
[NOBLE SOLDIER H grunting]
Dumb brat!

247
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,220
Go home!

[NOBLE SOLDIER J]
Let go, brat!

252
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,765
Stay away from the lock!

253
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:21,202
Open the gate! [groans]

254
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:22,669
Stop!

255
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:24,672
No!

Why don'tcha be a good kid

258
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:35,783
and get outta here!

I'm sorry, guys.

Who's there?

[SABO]
Whoever you are, listen,

266
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,131
the nobles are the
ones behind this fire.

267
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,436
[SABO]
You gotta believe me!

268
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:33,974
[SABO] High Town reeks worse
than Gray Terminal ever did.

269
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:38,144
The people act civilized, but on
the inside, they're all rotten!

270
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,181
They only care about making
themselves look good,

271
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:42,483
no matter what it takes!

272
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:43,984
I can't stay here.

If I do, then
I'll never be free!

I'm ashamed of being born noble!

275

00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,731
look what you've
done to this child,

278
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,133
how you've turned
him against you.

279
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:03,570
[DRAGON]
I know how you feel.

280
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:06,273
I was born in this country, too.

281
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:10,778
[DRAGON] But I alone do not have
the power to change this world,

282
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:12,679
and maybe I never will.

283
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:13,914
But at least...

284
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:16,583
At least you're actually
listening to me, aren't you?

285
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:19,986
[DRAGON] Of course I am,
and I'll never forget.

It... can't be!

00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,061
Do something!

It's all over, isn't it?

292
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:12,639
[BLUEJAM PIRATE H] It's too late
to put out the fire, Captain!

293
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:14,074
We gotta abandon the ship!

294
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,176
The sea is blocked off anyway!

295
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,411
Damn the king!

296
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:20,147
That filthy cheat thinks
he can get away with this?

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,515
Just you wait. You're dead!

298
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,588
[KING] Must Gray Terminal
be an assault to my senses,

299
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:30,491
even in its final moments?

We are sorry, your majesty.

how come we wanna burn
everybody in Gray Terminal?

Aren't they people
too, just like us?

307
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,682
Not exactly.

308
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:56,984
They chose to live
meaningless lives.

309
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:58,585
Just think about it.

310
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:01,254
If they had chosen the
path of high-class nobility

311
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:04,391
like you and me,
they wouldn't be in this mess.

312
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,227
They wouldn't?

being born all poor and dumb!

How come you're still here?

00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:10,157
I thought you were escaping
after the fire got lit!

You do know that, right?

00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,934
There's a sort
of irony to this.

[BLUEJAM chuckles]
It's a new perspective.

345

Humans are strange
creatures. [chuckles]

00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:42,789
Grab 'em!

353
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:46,026
[ACE, LUFFY panting, gasp]

354
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,729
[BLUEJAM PIRATES chuckling]

355
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:53,633
[BLUEJAM]
Where do you think you're going?

356
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,168
We did this job together.

357
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,304
That means we get
to die together!

358
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:59,673
We're not gonna die
with you losers!

359
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,675
We don't give up that easy!

360
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,243
Is that so?

361
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,512
Actually, you still
haven't told me

362
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:07,048
where you're hiding
that treasure.

363
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:09,149
Friends don't keep
secrets from each other.

364
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:12,019
I'll save it for you before
the fire reaches it.

365
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:14,754
All you have to do
is tell me where it is.

366
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:17,891
Your life is in danger and
all you care about is treasure?

367
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,660
[BLUEJAM]
Well, if you don't want it,

368
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:24,030
then you might
as well tell me, right?

369
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,366
Dammit, you've gone nuts.

370
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,069
[BLUEJAM] I'm just trying
to stop another tragedy.

371
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:31,705
I already saw my ship
reduced to charcoal.

372
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:35,408
It'd be a shame if that
happened to your treasure, too.

373
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:38,045
All your hard work,
and for nothing.

374
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:40,314
You suck! Get your own treasure!

375
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:42,216
All right. You win.

376
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,250
[LUFFY gasps]

377
00:19:43,284 --> 00:19:44,318
No!

378
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,753
You spent forever
collecting that!

379
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:47,153
What would Sabo think?

380
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,055
[ACE]
Shut up!

381
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:49,323
Sabo would understand!

382
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:50,658
[LUFFY gasps]

383
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,993
[ACE] The treasure
isn't important anymore.

384
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,430
The only thing that matters
is getting out of here alive.

385
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:58,231
[ACE grunts]

386
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,101
[BLUEJAM grunts]

387
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,971
Ace.

388
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:15,482
[ACE]
Six years.

389
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:16,984
We've collected
treasure for six years

390
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:18,252
and hid it in this tree.

391
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:19,719
[BLUEJAM]
Why, thank you.

392
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:22,590
[ACE]
Don't cry!

393
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:25,559
It's okay, Luffy.
This won't be the end.

394
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:31,765
[ACE, LUFFY grunt]

395
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:32,833
[ACE]
What are you doing?

396
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:34,802
I told you where
it is, now let us go!

397
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:38,472
I'm sorry. I don't
think I trust you.

398
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,808
Now then, about that treasure.

399
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:42,576
Let's go. You can lead.

400
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,576
You moron!

401
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,312
That won't leave us
time to escape,

402
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,481
and I'm not dying here! Just go!

403
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,316
You've got the damn map!

404
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,552
[ACE grunts]

405
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:53,554
[BLUEJAM]
Listen, kid.

406
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:56,623
Don't you dare piss me off.

407
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,425
I'm not above stealing
from children,

408
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,493
or murdering them.

409
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:00,994
I'll have my revenge.

410
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,463
And believe me,

411
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:05,165
those nobles will regret
the day they crossed Bluejam.

412
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:08,502
And to think, you call
one of them your brother.

413
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:10,504
They act like a little
money and influence

414
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:13,173
makes them a gift to
the rest of the world,

415
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:15,142
like it gives them the
right to look down on us

416
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:16,543
like we're trash!

417
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:19,146
Shut up! Sabo isn't
like that! Take it back!

418
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,215
Yes, he is! Face it!

419
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:23,984
Sure, you stayed together,

420
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:27,621
but he was looking down
on you the whole time!

421
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,056
Liar!

422
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:30,724
[BLUEJAM]
His parents are loaded.

423
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:31,992
He doesn't have
any of the problems

424
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,961
that you or I deal with!

425
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:37,030
He used you idiots
to get some kicks.

426
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:40,033
He was just bored.
Then got a taste of real life

427
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,002
and he ran back home
to his rich daddy!

428
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:44,672
That's enough!
Sabo is our brother!

429
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:47,474
He's right! Sabo just
wants to be free!

430
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:48,675
[BLUEJAM PIRATE D groans]

431
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:50,777
[BLUEJAM PIRATE D growls]

432
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,312
[ACE]
Luffy!

433
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:53,614
[LUFFY yelps]

434
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:54,781
[ACE gasps]

435
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:57,217
Say goodbye, kid!

436
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,819
[BLUEJAM chuckles]

437
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:01,088
[LUFFY groaning]

438
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:03,790
Just let me go!

439
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,626
[LUFFY yelling]

440
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:06,727
[BLUEJAM PIRATE D yells]

441
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,462
Get the hell away from Luffy!

442
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:33,653
[BLUEJAM gasping]

443
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,028
Hey! Talk to me!

444
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:42,395
[ACE grunts]

445
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:44,765
What the hell did you do?

446
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,267
[ACE groans]

447
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:48,702
Ow.

448
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:51,739
You screwed up big time, brat!

449
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:52,873
Go on.

450
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:54,508
Try that crap again
before I kill you.

451
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,810
Get off of me, you scumbag!

452
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:00,213
[BLUEJAM]
Time's up!

453
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:02,950
Ace! No!

454
00:23:02,983 --> 00:23:06,019
Don't do it!

455
00:23:08,122 --> 00:23:09,923
[gunshot]

456
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,331
[NARRATOR] Even as the
fires in Gray Terminal

457
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:19,666
threaten to consume them,

458
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,803
Ace and Luffy fight Bluejam
with all their might.

459
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,337
In the wake of the tragedy,

460
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:27,974
Sabo decides to seize freedom in
his hands and takes to the sea,

461
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:31,077
as a Celestial Dragon
arrives in High Town.

462
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:32,846
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

463
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:37,184
"Where Can Freedom be Found?
A Sad Depature of a Boy!"

464
00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:39,719
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
