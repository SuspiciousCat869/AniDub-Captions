1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,509
So what you're saying is
that you left the Straw Hats,

2
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,211
but you haven't given
up your life of crime.

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,779
What a shame.

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,582
If you're a pirate,
you're coming with us.

5
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,786
Merry!

6
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,326
I think I know
the answer, actually.

7
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,730
You have no idea how
much the World Government

8
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,666
has warped my life,
do you hear me?

9
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,538
If you hate the
government so much

10
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,740
then why would you help them?!

11
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:43,443
Because I have a wish that I
would sacrifice anything for.

12
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:50,217
They picked up
the life I gave up on,

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,822
returned the heart I lost
and continued the dreams

14
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,324
that I no longer believed in.

15
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,160
Even after all I've done,

16
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:04,431
I've found friends who
will still believe in me.

17
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:09,069
I see but then
what is your wish?

18
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:12,072
That excluding me, all of
the other Straw Hat pirates

19
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,375
will be allowed to
leave this island safely!

20
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,712
And as long as you have that,

21
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,283
you don't care what happens to
you of the rest of the world?!

22
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,783
I don't.

23
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,191
She was willing to
sacrifice the lives

24
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,461
of everyone in this
world, even her own.

25
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:38,031
As long as she could
save the six of you.

26
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,168
She was protecting us.

27
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,670
C'mon Chopper, wake up!

28
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,538
We have to find everyone!

29
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:45,739
You can sleep when you're dead.

30
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,009
We gotta get moving before
they take Robin away for good!

31
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:14,802
All right, CP9 should
be here any second now.

32
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:15,903
Let's go, Robin.

33
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,806
You'll have to get on
that train sooner or later.

34
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,207
You heard me.

35
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,710
Take the lady and
get moving, you dimwits.

36
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,177
Yes, sir!

37
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:34,154
A government rep,
a bunch of marines and Robin.

38
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:39,360
Let's see, how
should I play this?

39
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,361
Because inside of me,

40
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:44,331
I carry a darkness that
none of you know about.

41
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,734
No matter how you look at it,

42
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,503
they're obviously
escorting her away.

43
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,772
But those guys are chumps,
if she wanted to run,

44
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,641
she could take
them out, no problem.

45
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,347
She must be planning
something we don't know about.

46
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,083
There's gotta be a reason
why she's not running.

47
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,687
I'm here for you my darling!

48
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,725
Oh, my prince has
come to rescue me!

49
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,693
I've been waiting!

50
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,468
Aw, you want me
to save you, Robin?

51
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,456
Corgy, sir. CP9 is here.

52
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,161
Stop man handling me, damn it!

53
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,462
This body is expensive!

54
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,165
Oh man that's Rob Lucci, huh?

55
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:54,101
He's got the eyes of a killer!

56
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:56,370
Never thought I'd
see CP9 in person.

57
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,205
I'm gonna give you
to the count of ten,

58
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,609
and then it's gonna
get ugly! Do you hear me?!

59
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,244
Let go!

60
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,712
You don't know who
you're messing with!

61
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,081
I've got eight thousand men
hiding in the shadows

62
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,383
just waiting to teach
you losers a lesson!

63
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,619
Yep! They're gonna pop
out any minute now!

64
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,554
Any minute, you hear me?!

65
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,656
Better put me down quick!

66
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,390
Usopp, too?

67
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,177
The Sea Train Starts to Run."

68
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,115
All right, I'll give
you one last chance!

69
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:24,051
I'll call my men off for now,
but once we get on that train,

70
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,353
they're gonna tear
you limb from limb!

71
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,389
Listen jerks, if I were
you I'd quit while I was--

72
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,792
Why is he here?

73
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,499
Excellent work as
always, sirs and madam!

74
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,537
Here, Mr. Lucci, your coat.

75
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,140
What is this, a parade?

76
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,041
Stop it.

77
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:47,641
It's foolish.

78
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,076
Ah, right.

79
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,777
Sorry, sir!

80
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,183
This isn't over until we reach
Enies Lobby, so look sharp!

81
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,153
Everyone, board the
sea train immediately!

82
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,454
You heard the man!

83
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,789
Get on the train
and make it quick!

84
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:06,092
Hey, you bastards
gonna put me down or--?!

85
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,498
Who are those
guys in the suits?

86
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,640
He says he's sorry for
causing us so much trouble

87
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,642
then he goes and gets
in trouble all over again.

88
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,212
A little further to the right!

89
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,447
Spray over there!

90
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,448
Bring the hose this way!

91
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,183
We've almost got it!

92
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,719
I think we're good
over here for now.

93
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,520
Go see if you can help
out with the injured!

94
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,356
Right! I'm on it!

95
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:36,657
Is there anyone left inside?!

96
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,324
Hey!

97
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,358
Watch your step over there!

98
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:42,796
So you mean Robin
doesn't hate us after all?!

99
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,298
Uh-huh!

100
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,133
I'm so happy!

101
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,534
Huh? He's a raccoon dog?

102
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,370
I thought he was a reindeer!

103
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,605
Did he just transform, or what?

104
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,606
Anyway Chopper.

105
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,475
We have to find the rest
of the crew right away

106
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,277
so we can all go rescue Robin!

107
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,145
Okay! Let's go!

108
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,614
Uh, but where are they?

109
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,314
I don't know!

110
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:02,583
That's why we have to find them!

111
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:06,287
Yeah! Let's do this!

112
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,789
Now he's a gorilla!

113
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,325
Wait, you two.

114
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:17,097
I don't care if you
go after Nico Robin

115
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,233
but before you run off, you
should know that the sea train

116
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:22,803
for government personnel is
departing at 11 o'clock tonight.

117
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,371
This is just my guess

118
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,608
but there's a good chance
you'll find CP9 there.

119
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:32,079
And that means Nico Robin
will be there as well.

120
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,280
Thanks to Aqua Laguna,

121
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,216
they're stopping all service
after this final departure.

122
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,283
In other words,

123
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:40,120
you won't be able to chase
them on another train.

124
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,290
Wait, you mean we have to--

125
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,392
Since you obviously
can't sail in this weather,

126
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:46,660
you won't be able to
leave the island

127
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,330
unless you go after
that train right now.

128
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,097
Huh?!

129
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:50,664
No way!

130
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,765
What time is it?

131
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:52,733
Almost 10:30.

132
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:53,734
What?!

133
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,669
That means we've only
got half an hour left!

134
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,438
Hey, but you're
the mayor, right?

135
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,707
Can't you do something
to stop the train?

136
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,244
Mwell unfortunately,
it's bound for Enies Lobby,

137
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,713
which is only accessible
to government personnel.

138
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,115
Even the engine driver
works for the government.

139
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,050
So I have no say in this matter.

140
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,619
Oh no!

141
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,355
I guess our only choice
is to head to the station

142
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,490
and try to talk
some sense into Robin.

143
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,724
Chopper!

144
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,661
I'll tell you which direction
Luffy and Zoro flew off in,

145
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,596
so you go search there, okay?

146
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:23,730
If you find them,

147
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,566
tell them to come to the
station as quickly as they can!

148
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,267
Okay.

149
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,269
Got it!

150
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,404
Hey, listen up.

151
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,338
Look you guys!

152
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,740
Paulie's okay!

153
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,675
See that girl over there?

154
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,144
I want you to help
her find her buddies.

155
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,278
What?

156
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:40,514
You sure that smoke didn't
get to your brain, Paulie?

157
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,783
These are the guys that
tried to kill Mister Iceberg.

158
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,252
We should wring their
no-good-sorry necks!

159
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,788
Besides, why should we waste
our time helping some criminals

160
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,224
when Lucci and Kaku
are still missing?!

161
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,493
The Straw Hats aren't
the ones who did it, okay?

162
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,561
The real criminals set them up!

163
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,063
If we hadn't been so damn blind,

164
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,099
we wouldn't be in this
situation right now!

165
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,236
I don't know the real identity
of those guys in the masks

166
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,637
but I do know
that the Straw Hats

167
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,639
tried to protect us from them.

168
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,642
As a matter of fact, Iceberg
and I wouldn't even be alive

169
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:12,145
right now if it
wasn't for their help.

170
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,686
Don't bother looking for
Lucci and Kaku there's no point.

171
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,689
In fact, I don't know if we'll
ever be seeing them again.

172
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:22,556
What?

173
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,258
If you know what
happened to the foremen,

174
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,594
then you gotta tell us, Paulie!

175
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,795
They went back home.

176
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:28,796
Huh?!

177
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,497
Why would they do
that at a time like this?!

178
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,766
Just shut up and
go find Straw Hat!

179
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,401
Hey, immoral girl!

180
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,238
What? You're still
calling me that?

181
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,640
If you're going to the station,
I'll show you the way.

182
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,008
Uh thanks, I guess.

183
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,144
Hey, hold a sec, Paulie!

184
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,080
Is that stuff you told us true?!

185
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,782
Quit yer yapping and
help them out already!

186
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,718
You're making
Galley-La look bad!

187
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,685
Yes!

188
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:52,753
Sorry, sir!

189
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:53,787
We'll do our best!

190
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,688
You're the boss!

191
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,322
Yeah!

192
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,157
We'll help any way we can!

193
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,292
Open the cage!

194
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,460
Bring out the yagaras!

195
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,760
Yeah!

196
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:06,500
"Went back home," did they?

197
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,469
I spared 'em the details.

198
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,137
It's better that way.

199
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,206
It was bad enough
when we found out.

200
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:16,042
They deserve the truth but
I don't wanna hurt those guys.

201
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:35,729
'Kay, Chopper!

202
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,132
It's all up to you, now!

203
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,466
Right!

204
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:43,036
I'll find Luffy and Zoro,
you can count on me!

205
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,128
Hey!

206
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,798
Guys!

207
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,734
Hello?

208
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,370
Hey! Guys! Can you hear me?!

209
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,805
Luffy!

210
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,440
Zoro!

211
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,442
Sanji!

212
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:24,511
Usopp, you can come
with us too, okay?

213
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,380
Now shout it with me!

214
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,416
All right buddy, you
got it. Let's do it, guys!

215
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,151
Yeah!

216
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:31,719
Hey!

217
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:32,786
Luffy!

218
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,155
Zoro!

219
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,491
Sanji!

220
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,626
Usopp, you can come with us too.

221
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,402
Take that canal over
on the left-hand side.

222
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,403
It's a shortcut to the station!

223
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,417
We still have 20 minutes
before the train leaves.

224
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,085
Don't go, Robin.

225
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,588
You don't have to
sacrifice yourself!

226
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,057
We can save you!

227
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,793
Mr. Yagara, you think you can
go a little bit faster, please?

228
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,508
The 11 o' clock train
is about to depart.

229
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:31,211
All passengers going from
Blue Station to Enies Lobby,

230
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,346
please board immediately.

231
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,651
That hurt!

232
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,386
I don't wanna hear another
word out of you two!

233
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,754
Well maybe I wouldn't
complain so much

234
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,556
if you weren't
such big jerkwads!

235
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,091
Yeah you big jerkwads!

236
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,492
Why don't you come
over here and fight?!

237
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,727
Hey, that's too much.

238
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,602
Due to the approaching storm
surge, the departure time

239
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:57,638
has been moved up and the
train will be departing shortly.

240
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:01,007
Damn it, this was
bad enough already.

241
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:05,912
After all these years,

242
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,215
our mission has
finally come to an end.

243
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,483
We're not there yet.

244
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,450
Stop spouting nonsense

245
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:13,821
and take your mission
seriously, you fool.

246
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,689
My apologies.

247
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,694
You can't sail in this weather.

248
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:24,265
Unless you can catch that train
you won't be able to leave.

249
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:25,232
Come on.

250
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,800
We're so close!

251
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:42,482
Franky, wherever you
are I hope you're safe.

252
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,495
Hey, Luffy!

253
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,363
Roronoa!

254
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,531
Luffy!

255
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,299
Hey!

256
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,267
Come back!

257
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,236
Where are you?!

258
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:02,803
Come on!

259
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,405
There's not much time!

260
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:05,639
Zoro!

261
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,675
Sanji!

262
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:11,211
Usopp, you can come too.

263
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,479
Luffy, please!

264
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:16,283
Those guys're gonna
take Robin away!

265
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,118
We need your help!

266
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,786
Where are you?!

267
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,700
I wonder how the rest of the
crew is dealing with this mess.

268
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:36,002
Anyway, time's up. They'll
have to catch me later.

269
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:40,641
I repeat: the final train will
be departing ahead of schedule.

270
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,609
Please board immediately.

271
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:49,450
Damn it!

272
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,719
You bastards!

273
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,220
I'm coming for you!

274
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,488
Just wait, you'll see!

275
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,361
Once I get out of here.

276
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:05,532
One little slip-up,
then this crap happens.

277
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,738
I'm coming for you bastards.

278
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,176
Once I get out of here.

279
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,414
Luffy!

280
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,815
Zoro!

281
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:24,184
Sanji!

282
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,720
Where are you?

283
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,223
We gotta save Robin!

284
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:32,092
Straw Hat!

285
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,594
Roronoa!

286
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:41,368
I don't get it.
Where in the heck are they?

287
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,736
Have we checked over there yet?

288
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,305
Hey!

289
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,606
Straw Hat!

290
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,174
Zoro!

291
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,542
I guess they're not here.

292
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:51,145
Has anybody checked
over in the backstreets yet?

293
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,379
I don't know if we can.

294
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,748
They're probably
completely flooded by now.

295
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,817
It'd be too dangerous
to look for them there.

296
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,086
Come on, guys!

297
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,421
Where are you?!

298
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,222
There's no time!

299
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,302
Excuse me.

300
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,071
The waves are getting
dangerously high,

301
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:19,673
so we've decided to depart
early as a safety measure.

302
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,275
If it's any trouble, we could...

303
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:22,042
It's fine.

304
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:22,776
Just go.

305
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:23,677
Coo coo!

306
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,612
Yes, sir.

307
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:30,050
We lived here for five years

308
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:34,454
but even as we leave I don't
feel nostalgic in the least.

309
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,143
Hey, was that a
steam whistle just now?

310
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,145
If it was, that means
the train is running

311
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:01,414
nearly fifteen minutes
ahead of schedule.

312
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,353
They're probably
taking off early,

313
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,522
'cause the weather's
getting bad.

314
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,057
The government runs that line,

315
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,359
so they can leave
whenever they want!

316
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,328
Hurry it up, guys!

317
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,663
The station's right there!

318
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:16,563
Hold on, train!

319
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,698
Don't leave yet!

320
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,539
Attention, tonight's final
departure, heading from

321
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:29,142
Water Seven to Enies Lobby
is now leaving the station.

322
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:32,646
You heard her.

323
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,114
Sit down already.

324
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,082
Have a safe trip.

325
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,226
I no longer have
any reason to live!

326
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,095
Just leave me here to die!

327
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,196
I don't have to listen to you.

328
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:52,199
You're coming with me
whether you like it or not.

329
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:55,369
I wanted nothing more than
to die at that very moment.

330
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:57,171
But, you forced me to live.

331
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:59,739
That's your crime!

332
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:07,181
I'm afraid there's no place
left for me to go or return to.

333
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:09,250
So I've decided to
stay here with you.

334
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:10,117
I see your problem,

335
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:12,219
guess there's no
other choice, is there?

336
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,187
Welcome.

337
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,588
Luffy!

338
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,423
Hey, there's nothing
to worry about.

339
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:20,393
She isn't a bad person.
Trust me, okay?!

340
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:30,270
Could he... Could he
mean the Rio Poneglyph?!

341
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:32,640
Like Gold Roger before me,

342
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,174
I have an important
duty to fulfill.

343
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,643
To guide the passages,

344
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:40,180
I've read to the end of
the Grand Line to Raftel.

345
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,673
Hey, Robin!

346
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:06,674
Robin!

347
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,642
Are you feeling okay now?

348
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,623
Hey, I think we're moving.

349
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:25,525
Stupid government jerkwads.

350
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,470
Good job, Mr. Yagara!

351
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:38,639
Go down the stairs
through the middle entrance!

352
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:39,606
Got it!

353
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,209
We're coming for you
Robin, please don't go!

354
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:52,319
Hey, stop!

355
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,354
Who are you?

356
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:54,288
That's dangerous!

357
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:55,689
Stay back!

358
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,529
Robin, get off that train!

359
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:05,065
I don't care who you're
up against. We'll help you!

360
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,568
Luffy!

361
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,403
Zoro!

362
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:13,073
Where are you guys?!

363
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,679
Can't move.

364
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:22,782
Wait!!

365
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,454
No!

366
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,524
Come back!

367
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:39,132
Robin!!

368
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:52,045
Robin!

369
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,496
What's this letter?

370
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,831
You mean Sanji
got on the sea train?!

371
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:18,798
Good!

372
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,501
Then he can protect
Robin 'til we get there!

373
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:21,435
Right!

374
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,404
We'll meet up with
everyone at Enies Lobby!

375
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:26,106
But I still can't
find Luffy and Zoro.

376
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:28,309
There's no way we can
do this without them!

377
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:30,044
They have to be here somewhere!

378
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:33,147
On the next One Piece:
"Sanji Barges in!

379
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,514
Sea Train Battle in the Storm!"

380
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:37,417
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
