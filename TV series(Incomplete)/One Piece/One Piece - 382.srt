1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,044
I'll have a
"Rainbow Rock", please.

38
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,129
That's an excellent choice.

39
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,236
This is the life!

40
00:02:58,269 --> 00:02:59,304
Who would have ever thought

41
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:01,573
that when we sailed
through the Florian Triangle

42
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:04,542
that we would end up in a
fabulous place like this?

43
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,510
[NAMI]
Right?

44
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:07,345
I'm so glad that you
find our accommodations

45
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:08,546
to your liking.

46
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,417
On Spa Island, we proudly
boast 10 heated swimming pools,

47
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,687
three simulated river pools,

48
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,755
and pools dedicated to diving.

49
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,526
We also have
waterfalls for meditation,

50
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,229
cola baths, milk baths,
you name it!

51
00:03:24,262 --> 00:03:27,765
There are more than 50
varieties of spas available.

52
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,500
For those who
enjoy playing games,

53
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:33,238
we have in-pool table tennis
as well as an in-pool casino.

54
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:35,707
As for food, our
restaurant has top chefs

55
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,941
providing delicious cuisine

56
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:40,645
from all over the world
in gigantic proportions.

57
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,214
Our top priority is
the pleasure of our guests.

58
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:44,849
And I, Doran,
the proprietor here,

59
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:47,518
find my own pleasure
making sure this happens.

60
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:49,387
On occasion, some guests
are lucky enough

61
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,955
to witness rainbows
and candy rain

62
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:52,657
at our establishment as well.

63
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,225
Oh yeah!
I've heard of that!

64
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,660
It's some kind of
natural occurrence

65
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,528
people call "the Gem
of the Ocean", right?

66
00:03:57,562 --> 00:03:59,264
But there hasn't
been a confirmed sighting

67
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:01,432
of that phenomenon
in quite some time.

68
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:03,768
Which is why I noted that
the guests who do see them

69
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:06,404
are considered quite lucky.

70
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:08,239
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

71
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:11,943
I think we're about to be
some of those lucky guests.

72
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:12,977
Girugiru!

73
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:14,846
Oh, surely you jest.

74
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:17,849
It's hard to believe
you made this place

75
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,384
way out here yourself.

76
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:20,785
That must have
been quite a task.

77
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:21,986
Girugirugiru!

78
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,121
It was,

79
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:25,356
but when you bring in over
10 billion berries a year

80
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,859
in profits and become an
officially recognized resort

81
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,762
by the World Government,
it makes it all worthwhile.

82
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:33,331
We also have a highly
sophisticated security team

83
00:04:33,364 --> 00:04:34,999
so civilians can
enjoy themselves

84
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:36,668
without a care in the world.

85
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,703
It truly is a paradise.

86
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,372
Over 10 billion
berries a year?

87
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,275
And of course pirates
can relax here, as well.

88
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:45,643
Girugirugiru!

89
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:47,412
We do appreciate that.

90
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:48,146
Certainly, madam.

91
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:49,747
Just thought I'd
make note of it.

92
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:51,549
Pirates, civilians,
it doesn't matter.

93
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,817
As long as you're
a paying customer,

94
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,386
consider yourself
safe here in our care.

95
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:58,256
Girugirugiru!

96
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,591
A man after your own heart.

97
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,926
Wouldn't you agree?

98
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,895
Over 10 billion berries!

99
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,630
Berries, berries, berries!

100
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,368
[LUFFY]
The Slow-Slow Menace!

101
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:12,804
"Silver Fox" Foxy Returns!

102
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:22,880
[LUFFY]
Ready? Go!

103
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:46,504
[giggling]

104
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,777
What in the heck is this?

105
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,416
Whoa, it's candy!

106
00:05:58,449 --> 00:05:59,450
It's raining candy!

107
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,618
It's just that one cloud!

108
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,620
And looks like
it's only falling on us!

109
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,856
We're so super lucky!

110
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:06,524
Super lucky!

111
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,098
That's too much!

112
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:21,739
[shouting and laughing]

113
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:31,983
[laughing]

114
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,419
[GIRL] What a bunch of
dummies! You're funny!

115
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:39,624
[USOPP]
Hey! What is that?

116
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:43,294
Oh, you mean this guy?

117
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:45,062
That's Nukki,
he's a sea raccoon.

118
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:47,398
He can transform into anything.

119
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:48,833
[NUKKI]
Nukki!

120
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,667
Nukki!

121
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,905
--That's awesome!
--That's awesome!

122
00:06:57,975 --> 00:07:00,678
He just said that this
girl's name is Rina.

123
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,447
It's a talking raccoon-dog!

124
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,781
I am not a raccoon-dog!

125
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:05,450
I'm a reindeer!

126
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:08,553
You have a raccoon.

127
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:09,187
Can't you tell?

128
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,755
[RINA'S stomach growling]

129
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:13,191
It sounds like you're hungry.

130
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,493
Uh, yeah.

131
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:16,761
[LUFFY]
How about this?

132
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:19,096
It's the official meal
of a pirate captain!

133
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:21,799
Pirate?

134
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,634
You mean you guys are--

135
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:25,770
The name's Luffy.

136
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:28,539
And I'm the man who's gonna
be King of the Pirates!

137
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,475
And I'm Chopper!
Ship's doctor!

138
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:33,044
Captain Usopp here!
The ship's sniper!

139
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:36,681
So even silly
people can be pirates!

140
00:07:36,714 --> 00:07:38,783
I thought all
pirates were scary!

141
00:07:39,684 --> 00:07:42,687
It's nice to meet you!
And thanks for the food!

142
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:44,989
Hey, what's wrong?

143
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:47,425
I wonder if my
big sister wants some.

144
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,027
[LUFFY, CHOPPER, USOPP]
Big sister?

145
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:56,642
[RINA]
Hey, Sayo!

146
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,531
Some appetite, huh?

147
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,533
This little guy
will eat anything!

148
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,200
Well, of course!

149
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,169
Sea raccoons are omnivores.

150
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,604
Does that include this?

151
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,440
--As if!
--As if!

152
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,414
What in the hell is that?

153
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,952
[SANJI] Wait! You're saying
it can change into anything?

154
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,220
[LUFFY]
Pretty much.

155
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,525
Make yourself beautiful!

156
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,194
The hottest, sexiest thing ever!

157
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,372
[NUKKI]
Nukki! Nukki!

158
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,208
[SANJI] I really walked right
into that one, didn't I?

159
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,743
No, I mean like
that girl over there!

160
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,578
Turn into Nami for me!

161
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:15,888
[groaning]

162
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,490
[SANJI]
Too small!

163
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:20,860
[SANJI]
What an idiot!

164
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,428
How could I be so--

165
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:27,233
Even though she's tiny,
she's still Nami!

166
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,802
Nami-swan!

167
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,237
[NAMI]
Moron!

168
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:32,805
You see?

169
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,707
I told you they're
a bunch of weirdoes!

170
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,516
Do you wanna go, sis?

171
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,956
Thanks for the food!
We appreciate it!

172
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,390
No problem.
You're leaving?

173
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,693
Yes. Thank you again
for all your kindness.

174
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,661
[CHOPPER]
Sanji, are you all right?

175
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,598
Goodbye, Luffy!

176
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,466
Thanks again
for the food and fun!

177
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,603
Aw, do you have to leave
so soon, little sea raccoon?

178
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,203
You're hopeless.

179
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,239
[FOXY]
Fehfehfehfeh!

180
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,544
[FOXY] I've been looking
everywhere for you two.

181
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,946
Fehfehfehfeh!

182
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,948
[HAMBURG]
Pupupupu!

183
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:16,949
Don't you ever give up?

184
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,918
I can't believe I had
to chase you two brats

185
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,319
all the way out here.

186
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,421
You really gave
me the run-around.

187
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,757
Now, if you come
along quietly...

188
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,392
Hold on a second.

189
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:29,729
There seem to be some
other familiar faces here.

190
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,433
[FOXY] So this is where you've
been, my dear old rival!

191
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:40,773
Straw Hat Luffy!
It's been a long time!

192
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,475
Do I know you?

193
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,879
[FOXY] "Do I know you?"
He doesn't remember me!

194
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,615
It's okay, boss!
Don't be sad!

195
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,083
[HAMBURG]
Pupupupu!

196
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,019
Hey, hold on a second.

197
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,058
[LUFFY] You're the guy
Zoro and Sanji beat up!

198
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,862
[FOXY] He's doing it on purpose!
Playing with my mind!

199
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,897
It'll be okay, Boss!

200
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,500
Fine! Let me remind you, then!

201
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,635
You ended my
undefeated winning streak.

202
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,037
You stole my pirate flag.

203
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,039
I challenged you
to a Davy Back fight!

204
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,808
Does any of this ring a bell?

205
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,643
Oh! I remember now!

206
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,078
Stupid splithead guy!

207
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,714
Dammit! That's Silver Fox Foxy!

208
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,616
Hey. Be careful, Luffy.

209
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,918
I remember him shooting
some kinda weird beams.

210
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,019
Beams, huh?

211
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,021
[SANJI] True, but we already
know how to avoid them.

212
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,056
It shouldn't be a problem.

213
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,991
Fehfehfehfeh!

214
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,993
I've got a new trick
or two up my sleeve!

215
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,394
Observe!

216
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,634
Is that made of mirrors?

217
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,437
[PORCHE]
High Speed Rotation Mirror Ball!

218
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,540
[FOXY] Followed by
the new Slow-Slow Beam!

219
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,577
That's gotta be
against the rules!

220
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,728
[USOPP]
I... hate... that... beam!

221
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,796
Dammit!

222
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,898
[FOXY]
Fehfehfehfeh!

223
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,936
[FOXY] Anyone caught in the
path of my Slow-Slow Beam

224
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,839
will remain under its
effects for thirty seconds.

225
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,574
I'll take that.

226
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,643
[FOXY]
Fehfehfehfeh!

227
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,913
So, do you remember me now,
Straw Hat Luffy?

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,668
[FOXY]
Fehfehfehfeh!

229
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,671
In about ten seconds,
you'll drop like rocks.

230
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,606
Now nine!

231
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,774
Now eight!

232
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:55,574
[FOXY]
And seven!

233
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,977
My, what a
glorious bath that was!

234
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,579
My skin's sparkling
and squeaky clean!

235
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,681
Well, it would be
if I had any skin!

236
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,950
Yohohohoho!

237
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,090
[FRANKY] What the heck
are you guys doing?

238
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,992
[LUFFY]
Franky! Brook!

239
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,528
Kick those guy's asses!

240
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,696
[FRANKY]
Weapons Left!

241
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:25,871
[RANDOM SPA GOER 382A]
What's going on?

242
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,177
[screaming]

243
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,211
[NUKKI]
Nukki?

244
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,782
It's Luffy!

245
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,551
[ROBIN]
Cien Fleur!

246
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:41,620
[SANJI]
Thanks, Robin!

247
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,656
[USOPP]
You saved us!

248
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,124
Is everyone
all right down there?

249
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,726
Oh, goodness!
You had me worried!

250
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,768
[RINA]
How did you do that, Luffy?

251
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,269
Well, see...

252
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,838
I'm kinda made of rubber.

253
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,940
Plus, there's no way
I'd ever lose to splithead.

254
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,641
It would seem you've
added two new members

255
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,211
to your crew,
haven't you, Straw Hat?

256
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:09,715
Boss, look at that!

257
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,717
It's a living skeleton!

258
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,988
[FOXY] This isn't over yet,
you bastards!

259
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,524
Mirror Ball, round two!

260
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,128
[FOXY] Idiot, what are you
doing? Close the door!

261
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,169
Now Gum-Gum...

262
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,238
...Bazooka!

263
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:47,469
[screaming]

264
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,414
[MALE SPA ATTENDANT 382A]
Everyone, remain calm!

265
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,333
What the heck
is going on, huh?

266
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,939
[NAMI] Listen, I have something
I'd like to ask the two of you.

267
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,040
[SAYO]
What is it?

268
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,375
[NAMI]
The thing you're holding.

269
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,377
That's what Foxy
was after, wasn't it?

270
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,046
Your notebook.

271
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,180
[RINA]
Foxy?

272
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,448
[NAMI]
That pirate we just beat.

273
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,885
He doesn't like us, but I don't
think that we were his target.

274
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,086
So that must mean--

275
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,121
You girls are hiding
something important

276
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,456
in that notebook.

277
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,126
I'm right, aren't I?

278
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,227
Yeah, you're right.

279
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,862
The notebook has
special instructions

280
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,997
on how to make a gem!

281
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,232
Whoa! Did you say "make a gem"?

282
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,133
Rina, wait!

283
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:11,103
It's okay.
Just leave everything to me.

284
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,305
I know these people are
pirates, but they're different.

285
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,074
I think we can
put our trust in them.

286
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:15,941
And they're strong!

287
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,910
If you and I try
to handle this alone,

288
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,980
I'm starting to think we won't
be able to pull it off at all!

289
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:28,921
[RINA]
Here.

290
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,623
This is our daddy's notebook.

291
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,225
Oh, wow! Check it out!

292
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,860
They're scientific formulas!

293
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,095
Our daddy was an inventor.

294
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,296
Those are all his formulas.

295
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,532
Plus the directions for making
that gem I told you about.

296
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,102
Do you two actually know
what all this stuff means?

297
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,603
Sayo knows how to read it!

298
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,239
I don't know
what any of it means.

299
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,341
[NAMI]
That's amazing, Sayo!

300
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,877
Hey, wait.

301
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,346
There's also a sea chart
mapped inside here.

302
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,615
[USOPP] That steam
thing looks important.

303
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,350
[RINA]
That's the secret memo.

304
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,986
I think it's a hint as
to how the gem is made.

305
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,654
[NAMI]
Yeah? Seriously?

306
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,523
[RINA] The stuff in the
notebook is supposed to be

307
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,893
99% of everything
you need to make it.

308
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,130
[USOPP] So this little map
is a clue to the other 1%?

309
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,231
[SAYO]
That's right.

310
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,201
I'm betting that this
steam stands for a spa,

311
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,137
which means that this
"X" is somewhere here

312
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,238
on Spa Island.

313
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,039
Mmm-hmm.

314
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:20,906
That's just what
we were thinking,

315
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,008
which is why we snuck
onto the island.

316
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,176
Nice! Way to go!

317
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,277
[SAYO] But we've
searched everywhere

318
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,445
and haven't found anything.

319
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,381
Not even a clue as to what
or where that "X" could be.

320
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,683
It's hard to believe that
with all the other information,

321
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,253
the only way to make it work
is with some mysterious clue.

322
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,188
Well Foxy followed
them all the way out here

323
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,589
to find that clue, didn't he?

324
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:41,060
If he went to that much
trouble, it's gotta be real!

325
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,895
[RINA]
It might be a fake.

326
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,066
Rina.

327
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,069
In fact, I'm positive
this thing's a fake.

328
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,304
Dad doesn't know
how to make a gem.

329
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,172
What did you say?

330
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,408
Our daddy was a
moron and a big liar!

331
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,343
He was such an idiot!
I hate him!

332
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,445
He never did anything right!

333
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,080
And this's the same!

334
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,236
[RINA]
Daddy!

335
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,437
[SAYO]
Welcome back!

336
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:27,673
[RINA'S DAD]
Sayo! Rina!

337
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:28,707
Thank goodness you're here.

338
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,309
It's terrible news!

339
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,443
What is?

340
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,412
This Golden Horned-Beetle,
that's what!

341
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,380
According to legends,
when this thing appears,

342
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,583
the village of the one that
found it will be destroyed!

343
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,551
This is awful!

344
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,554
[RINA]
Daddy, look.

345
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,158
[RINA]
The gold is rubbing off.

346
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,627
[screams]

347
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,332
[BRATTY BOY 382A]
He totally fell for it!

348
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,633
[BRATTY BOY 382B]
Ha! That moron!

349
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,302
[RINA]
Scram!

350
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,371
What a bunch of stupid jerks!

351
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,607
The beetle was a fake!

352
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,642
What a relief!

353
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,610
It's fake!

354
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,512
That means the village
won't be destroyed!

355
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:11,150
It was a lie!
Isn't that wonderful?

356
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:16,121
[RINA] Dad loved our village and
he was proud to live there.

357
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,195
[RINA] Because that was the
place our mom was born.

358
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,340
[RINA'S DAD]
This research I'm doing

359
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,710
might save all the people
of this village someday.

360
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,413
Everyone will be able to live
their lives as they please

361
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,482
without a care in the world.

362
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,250
So what's the research about?

363
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,385
How can it help?

364
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,320
I'll tell you!

365
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,088
It's a way to create gems!

366
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,391
[laughing]

367
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,159
But that's impossible.

368
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,827
Gems aren't just
something you "make".

369
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,463
They're things you find.

370
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,266
[laughing]

371
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,270
Your old man
sounds really funny!

372
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,272
He's not funny!

373
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,142
He's an awful scientist
and an awful dad!

374
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,478
[RINA] Three years ago, he left
home to do some research,

375
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,113
but he never came back.

376
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,287
[RINA] He abandoned us,
just like that.

377
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,557
So we lived there together.
Just the two of us.

378
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,559
People made fun of us,
but we ignored them

379
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,095
and made the best of things.

380
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,663
I couldn't help but think,

381
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:35,300
"Daddy isn't here anymore.
He must have died."

382
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,338
[RINA]
And then, one month ago...

383
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,576
[RINA] Nukki came back
to us out of nowhere

384
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,411
with that notebook
in his mouth.

385
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,183
[RINA] We found a letter
folded up and stuck inside.

386
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,318
You know what it said?

387
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,355
It said, "Dear daughters,
please complete the research

388
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,723
that I began".

389
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,559
[RINA] Isn't that
the dumbest thing?

390
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,761
He left us to go who
knows where to study this,

391
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,730
and he never came back!

392
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,299
And now we're here risking our
lives to do the same thing

393
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,834
because he asked us to!

394
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,402
I hate that stupid man!

395
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,572
He left us behind to go chase
some crazy dream he has!

396
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,575
I bet this map is just
as fake as that gem is!

397
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,377
Why is the last part a clue?

398
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,280
It's like some
sort of lame test!

399
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,782
Man, your dad's a
pretty funny guy, huh?

400
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,691
Gem making
sounds pretty cool.

401
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,526
I really wanna see one.

402
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,463
What?

403
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,464
But... Wait.

404
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,400
Were you even listening
to what I was saying?

405
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,668
[ZORO]
Ah! Here you are!

406
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,436
Just waking up, eh, Zoro?

407
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,704
[RINA]
I'm talking to you!

408
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,772
If it's so stupid,

409
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,907
why are you here looking
for it in the first place?

410
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,443
I'm not looking for it!
My sister is!

411
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,445
I'm only here as her bodyguard!

412
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,814
Wait, you're her bodyguard?

413
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:56,815
[RINA]
Yeah.

414
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,016
Big sis says she'll keep
looking for the secret

415
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,752
and find it no matter what,
so I'm here to protect her.

416
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:01,787
Got it?

417
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,655
Hey, what's
going on over here?

418
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:04,489
[SAYO]
No, it's true!

419
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,391
There is a way
to create that gem!

420
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,465
No matter what you say,
I believe him.

421
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,901
Big sister...

422
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:25,777
Listen.

423
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,646
Everyone, please save--

424
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,481
[SAYO screams]

425
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,220
[RINA] No!
Sayo! Where are you?

426
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:36,788
[DORAN]
Girugirugiru!

427
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,223
[DORAN]
I have the girl.

428
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,358
Now...

429
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,360
If you want to see her again,
you'll do just as I say.

430
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,627
Is that Doran?

431
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,995
[CHOPPER]
Who the heck is Doran?

432
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,431
The owner and
proprietor of this place.

433
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,500
What the hell is he doing?

434
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,737
[DORAN]
Girugirugirugiru!

435
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,805
All of you are going
to search for that secret

436
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,407
in the notebook for me.

437
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,009
If you find it,
I'll give back the girl.

438
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,480
[DORAN]
Girugirugirugirugiru!

439
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,914
Holy crap on a stick!

440
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,684
Foxy wasn't the
only one after it!

441
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,919
Luffy! What are we gonna do?

442
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:22,367
[SAYO] Rina, please!
Finish the research!

443
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,969
Don't let Dad's dream
fall into the hands

444
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,737
of that stupid jerk!

445
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,806
[RINA] Dad's research
was nothing but lies!

446
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,376
I can't believe he took Sayo
over this stupid notebook!

447
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,812
Luffy, please, save her!

448
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,447
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

449
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,315
"The Great
Scramble for Treasure!

450
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,950
Collapse, Spa Island!

451
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,520
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
