1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:38,366
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,994
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:45,540
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,588
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,382
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,760
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,013
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,558
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,644
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,231
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,317
[NARRATOR] On route
to Fishman Island,

48
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,943
the Straw Hats
learned it was necessary

49
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,905
to have the Sunny coated
in order to travel underwater,

50
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,866
so they set sail for a
place known as Sabaody.

51
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,909
[PAPPAGU]
This is it!

52
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,578
The Sabaody Archipelago!

53
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,413
[NARRATOR] The location
seemed peaceful enough,

54
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,583
so Luffy and the others set
out to find a coating mechanic.

55
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,003
However, they soon encountered
several Celestial Dragons,

56
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,715
the cruel and sadistic rulers
of the World Government.

57
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,674
[DEVIL]
This collar!

58
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,969
If I could only get
this thing off my neck!

59
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,599
[ROSWALD]
Honestly!

60
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,017
You're terrible at
taking care of them.

61
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,478
You make me want to vomit.

62
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,479
[gunshot fires]

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,146
Yo--

64
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,814
Calm down! Control yourself!

65
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,693
[HACHI] Whatever you're
thinking, don't think about it.

66
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,945
I don't understand!

67
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,656
An old man and a woman are no
match for a pirate like that!

68
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,782
What's going on here?

69
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,951
If anyone hurts
a Celestial Dragon,

70
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,619
Navy Headquarters
sends an admiral

71
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,789
and a fleet of battle ships
to handle the situation.

72
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,332
The Dragons are
from the bloodline

73
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,501
of the creators
of the World Government.

74
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,377
Are you serious?

75
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,504
800 years ago, a
group of twenty kings

76
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,297
came together
to create the organization

77
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,299
that's now known as
the World Government.

78
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,468
The Celestial Dragons
are their descendants.

79
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,387
[NARRATOR] And then,
a group of strangers

80
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,722
spied on them from the shadows.

81
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,809
[BOUNTY HUNTER 391B] A bounty
of 300 million berries!

82
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,105
[LUFFY]
New Rivals Gather!

83
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,482
The 11 Supernovas!

84
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,446
Now, Gum Gum...

85
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,699
...Pistol!

86
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,120
Yohohohoho!

87
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,831
What the hell is with this
freaky-ass skeleton?

88
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,543
[BOUNTY HUNTER 392A]
I got 'im!

89
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,338
[BROOK]
Gavotte Bond en Avant!

90
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,759
[BOUNTY HUNTER 392B]
Gotcha!

91
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,515
[BOUNTY HUNTER 392C]
He's as quick as a monkey!

92
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,558
Careful!

93
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,154
Damn it.

94
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,865
I knew they'd be tough, but
I'm way outta my league here.

95
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,493
It's time for plan B.
I need a hostage.

96
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,916
[HACHI]
Leave them alone!

97
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,627
Camie! Pappagu!

98
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,963
All right.
You're comin' with me.

99
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,841
[LUFFY]
Gum Gum...

100
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,427
[LUFFY]
...Bazooka!

101
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,642
All done.

102
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,977
Are you guys doin' okay?

103
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,687
Thanks for the
help there, Straw Hat.

104
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,189
Yeah, thank you, Luffychin!

105
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,482
Sure thing.

106
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,067
You guys done with yours?

107
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,151
Indeed.

108
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,447
[HACHI] You guys really are
amazing, you know that?

109
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,573
[LUFFY]
Thanks to your food!

110
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,991
I'm fightin' on a full stomach.

111
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,743
Those guys didn't
know what hit 'em.

112
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,705
Oh, man.

113
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,957
We didn't stand
a chance back there.

114
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,752
We're not ready
for a 300 million bounty.

115
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,378
Yeah.

116
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,253
Yeah, you might be right,

117
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,089
but just think about
how many big shots

118
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,007
are on the
archipelago right now.

119
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,052
We can at least bag
one of 'em, can't we?

120
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,471
Hey, wait. Hold on.

121
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,765
There's something
weird about that girl.

122
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,019
We might make
some money after all.

123
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,234
[BROOK]
I'm so perplexed.

124
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,944
What in the world is going on?

125
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,696
We're being bombarded with
bounty hunters left and right.

126
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,116
[CHOPPER] That's three times
we've been ambushed now.

127
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:48,950
[BROOK]
And the taste-testing,

128
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,120
ah, sorry,
I mean souvenir shops.

129
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,080
They've all disappeared.

130
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,206
[CHOPPER]
Yeah, it's kinda spooky

131
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,624
seein' all these
empty buildings

132
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,584
and no people walking around.

133
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,921
Seems like a sketchy location
for a coating mechanic.

134
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,047
[HACHI]
Nyuu.

135
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,758
You gotta keep in mind
how huge this archipelago is.

136
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,885
The government can't keep a
watchful eye on all of it,

137
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,011
y'know?

138
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,597
The marines won't even go
anywhere near this place.

139
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,141
Here, take a look.

140
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,977
A map of the islands?

141
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,687
It covers the
whole archipelago

142
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,565
with the groves grouped
into clusters of ten.

143
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,484
The borders aren't as
clear-cut in reality, of course,

144
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,821
but it's still pretty accurate
to the layout of things.

145
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,573
[HACHI] For example,
these are all the areas

146
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,199
we've passed through so far.

147
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,577
Your ship's docked
over here at number 40,

148
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,662
a district that caters
to the tourism trade

149
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,956
with souvenir shops and whatnot.

150
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,916
Then you've got
number 30 over here.

151
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,294
People usually call that
the amusement park district

152
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,921
since that's
where Sabaody Park is.

153
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,507
[BROOK] I see the naval post
is located on number 60.

154
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,843
I take it that's the
main entrance as well?

155
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,845
[HACHI]
Yeah, it's like the front door,

156
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,055
and the one place
we should avoid.

157
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:56,142
[CHOPPER] So which area are
we passing through right now?

158
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,059
[HACHI]
Right now?

159
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,605
This is Grove 16.
It's part of cluster 20.

160
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,233
Groves 1 through 29 are more or
less known as the lawless area.

161
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,195
That's why the place is crawling
with so many bounty hunters.

162
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,237
[CHOPPER] And you couldn't
have mentioned that

163
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,489
before we left the dock?

164
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,034
If I'd known that I would've
let Zoro or Sanji come instead!

165
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,202
[HACHI]
Don't worry, it's fine!

166
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,872
Our destination, Grove 13,
is just around the corner.

167
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,540
[CAMIE]
Oh my gosh, Chopperchin!

168
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,959
you and Skeletonchin
were really cool back there.

169
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,877
[CHOPPER]
Oh, shove it,

170
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,171
that doesn't make me
feel better, you jerk.

171
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,340
[BROOK] I'm blushing
so hard even my ears are red.

172
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,217
Although being a skeleton--

173
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,641
[HACHI]
All right! Here we are!

174
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,354
[CHOPPER]
We made it in one piece!

175
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,315
[HACHI] That's the shop there
on top of that big root.

176
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,399
[HACHI]
Let's hope they're still open.

177
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,402
It's been 10 years since
the last time I was here.

178
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,654
Hey, Camie,

179
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,822
is this boat coating mechanic
friend of yours a fishman, too?

180
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,449
[CAMIE] Y'know,
that's a good question.

181
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,909
Pappagu and I haven't met him.

182
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,620
I've heard he's the absolute
best there is, though.

183
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,872
Oh, I thought
you guys knew 'im.

184
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,791
Well, I guess we'll see.

185
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,966
[PAPPAGU] This place is
called Shakky's Rip-Off Bar?

186
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,218
[PAPPAGU]
Hachi...

187
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,636
I've got a sneaking suspicion

188
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,513
they're planning
on ripping us off.

189
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,807
[CHOPPER] This coating mechanic
isn't gonna beat us up

190
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,809
and take our money, is he?

191
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,352
[HACHI]
No, not at all!

192
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,520
They're good people.

193
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,439
I've known 'em since I was
no bigger than you, Pappagu.

194
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,692
[LUFFY] You didn't say
this place was a bar.

195
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,820
[HACHI] Well, it looks like
they're still in business.

196
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,321
[HACHI]
Rayleigh! Shakky!

197
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,829
Hey, c'mon in.
What can I get for ya?

198
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,746
Hold on.

199
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,748
Is that really you, Hatchan?

200
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,625
I haven't seen you in ages!

201
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,543
Nyuu!

202
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,004
I know, sorry it's
been so long, Shakky.

203
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:48,963
Me, too.

204
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,840
It's been at least
ten years, hasn't it?

205
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,425
Make yourselves comfortable.

206
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,676
I won't be another minute.

207
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,637
I just need to collect some
money these boys don't owe me.

208
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,848
[HACHI] Nyuu.
Sure, take your time.

209
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,807
[SHAKKY]
Thanks, hon.

210
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,018
[punching noises]

211
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,730
[SHAKKY]
Really?

212
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,690
So you gave up
the pirate life, Hatchan.

213
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,358
[HACHI]
Yeah, a lot happened.

214
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,610
[SHAKKY]
Well, I'm proud of you.

215
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,404
An honest life is the best life.

216
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,530
Gotta say...

217
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,365
It's not too often that you
come across a mermaid

218
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,908
above water like this.

219
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,745
So Camie, are you
Hatchan's girlfriend?

220
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,788
No, I'm sorry but no!

221
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,748
Hachin's great and all!

222
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,042
But no, I'm way too
young to get married!

223
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,710
[PAPPAGU] That's not
what girlfriend means.

224
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,671
Camie works with me at
my fried octopus fritter stand.

225
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,922
Oh, is that all?

226
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,132
Hey, that reminds me.

227
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,717
Can I get you guys some--

228
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,843
[BROOK]
My compliments, Shakky.

229
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,428
These boiled beans
are delicious.

230
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,055
[PAPPAGU]
They're raiding the fridge!

231
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,097
Luffy! Brook! No!

232
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,099
Stop before she rips you off!

233
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,518
It's okay,
you go right ahead.

234
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,521
Wait. I've got
something you'll like, too.

235
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,564
[SHAKKY]
Here.

236
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,441
Cotton candy?

237
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,942
Oh, wow! Thank you!

238
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,777
Well, of course.

239
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,655
And that'll just be
100,000 berries.

240
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,574
But I...

241
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,993
I don't... have that much.

242
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,037
No, honey,
it was just a joke.

243
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,955
I wouldn't charge
friends of Hatchan's,

244
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,582
and I sure wouldn't rip 'em off.

245
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,708
[CHOPPER]
Really?

246
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,711
How'd you know that's
Chopper's favorite food, lady?

247
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,712
[SHAKKY]
It was easy.

248
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,172
You're Monkey D. Luffy, right?

249
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,048
[LUFFY]
Whoa, hey!

250
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,132
You know who I am?

251
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,175
[SHAKKY]
Of course.

252
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,177
Everyone's talking
about your crew.

253
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,638
And I work to
stay well-informed.

254
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,514
[CHOPPER]
Wow.

255
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,933
You hear that, Luffy?
You're famous!

256
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,934
[SHAKKY]
Although...

257
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,061
I didn't know you had
a skeleton in your crew,

258
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,106
or that skeletons were
capable of moving and talking.

259
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,650
Ah. Please forgive
my late introduction.

260
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,859
My name's Brook,

261
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,529
although plenty of people
just know me as the skeleton.

262
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,155
Meeting you is a pleasure.

263
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,448
The pleasure's mine.

264
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,783
Oh. Look at that.

265
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,035
You've got a stray
morsel of food there.

266
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,457
You are amazing.

267
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,127
[BROOK]
She is beyond lovely!

268
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,795
Yohohohoho!

269
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,755
Tell me.
What color are your panties?

270
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,840
[PAPPAGU]
Inappropriate!

271
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,008
Let me see,
I think today's were--

272
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,177
[CAMIE]
No, you can't tell him that!

273
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,013
[BROOK] Yohoho!
You've melted my brain, madam!

274
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,558
It's turned to mush and
it's dripping out of my nose!

275
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,852
Not that I have a nose!
Yohohoho!

276
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,982
[SHAKKY] Here, that
should be warm enough.

277
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,483
[LUFFY]
Thank you.

278
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,652
[SHAKKY] I read an article
on you guys recently.

279
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,654
It was about the
Enies Lobby incident.

280
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,656
I'm curious how much is true.

281
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,824
Did you guys
really pick a fight

282
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,159
with the World Government?

283
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,577
[LUFFY]
Ah, who cares?

284
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,245
It's a long, boring story.

285
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,831
[SHAKKY]
Not much for bragging, huh?

286
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,792
You must be a big shot.

287
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,294
One thing I was curious about.

288
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,255
Are you related to the naval
officer, Monkey D. Garp?

289
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,507
I sure am.
Garp's my grandpa.

290
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,675
That's what I thought.

291
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,762
A long time ago, he used to
chase me all over the sea.

292
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,596
[LUFFY]
Why?

293
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,305
[HACHI]
There was a time when Shakky

294
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,599
was a notorious pirate, herself.

295
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,975
[LUFFY]
Whoa, really?

296
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:48,976
[SHAKKY]
Yep, it's the truth.

297
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,729
But I washed my hands of
it forty years ago now.

298
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,939
[LUFFY] Wait, forty years?
How old are you, lady?

299
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:54,774
[SHAKKY]
Old enough.

300
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,192
But these days,
I just get my kicks

301
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,277
from cheering on
rookies like you guys.

302
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,945
Which brings us
to why we're here.

303
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,322
Yeah, yeah, I know.

304
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,617
Don't waste your breath.
I already know the whole story.

305
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,243
You and Camie trekked up on land

306
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,871
and made the long uncomfortable
journey to the shop

307
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,541
in order to help Monkey and his
crew here get their ship coated.

308
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,752
Does that about sum it up?

309
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,961
That was delicious!

310
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,671
[SHAKKY]
Try this.

311
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,964
So long story short,

312
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,050
you have a coat job
for Rayleigh, don't you?

313
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,719
[HACHI]
Nyuu. Yeah, you got it.

314
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,887
[SHAKKY]
Well, I hate to tell you,

315
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,680
but he's not here right now.

316
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,600
[LUFFY] Huh?
Your mechanic's not here?

317
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,727
But we're tryin' to get
down to Fishman Island!

318
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,686
[SHAKKY]
I can guarantee you

319
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,064
he's still on the
archipelago, at least.

320
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,274
Your best bet would probably
be to search for him

321
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,777
in the bars or gambling houses.

322
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,778
Eh...

323
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,363
It'd be easier to just
wait until he gets back.

324
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,657
Sure, of course,
you can wait.

325
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,868
He'll be back eventually, but
he's been gone for half a year.

326
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,287
[BROOK, LUFFY, CHOPPER]
Half a year?

327
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,747
[SHAKKY]
I'm sure he's shacked up

328
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,833
with some girl
he met at a bar.

329
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,752
Can't really say I'm
too worried about him.

330
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,087
It's just natural behavior

331
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,130
for an old
ex-pirate to disappear.

332
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,925
They go exploring and
take their time coming back.

333
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,761
Wait, you're sayin' the
mechanic was a pirate, too?

334
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,595
That's right.

335
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,639
Well, that's
certainly a conundrum.

336
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,975
But if he's not here, then
I suppose we have no choice

337
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,351
but to find him ourselves.

338
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,894
Can you perhaps
tell us which groves

339
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,604
we should start
searching first?

340
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,814
[SHAKKY]
Let's see.

341
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,316
If I had to guess, I'd say
you're most likely to find him

342
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,069
somewhere between
Grove 1 and Grove 29.

343
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,737
Groves 1 through 29,

344
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,322
now where have I
heard that before?

345
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,907
Is that....

346
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,909
...the lawless area?

347
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,997
[SHAKKY]
He's quite notorious.

348
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,625
He can't relax if there's a
risk of running into the Navy.

349
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,252
So that's your best bet.

350
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,129
But if that place
doesn't work out.

351
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,298
Try Sabaody Park,
he likes it there.

352
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,008
[LUFFY]
The amusement park?

353
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,676
Yeah, that's where
we're lookin' first!

354
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,427
[CHOPPER]
All right!

355
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,304
[CAMIE]
Oh yeah, amusement park!

356
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,847
[PAPPAGU]
Camie! Cut it out!

357
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,307
[CHOPPER, BROOK, LUFFY, CAMIE]
Amusement park!

358
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,850
Amusement park!

359
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,809
Anyway.

360
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,643
Make sure you're careful

361
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,812
wherever you end up
looking for him.

362
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,357
[SHAKKY] According to
my network of contacts,

363
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,319
you've got some infamous
company out there.

364
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,363
With your arrival
on the Sabaody Archipelago.

365
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,324
There are now 11 people
with bounties

366
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,660
exceeding 100 million
berries on the groves.

367
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:21,712
There are 11 people
with bounties that high?

368
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,191
[CHOPPER, BROOK, LUFFY, CAMIE]
Amusement park! Amusement park!

369
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,108
Anyway.

370
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,943
Make sure you're careful

371
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,403
wherever you end up
looking for him.

372
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,823
[SHAKKY] According to
my network of contacts,

373
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,785
you've got some infamous
company out there.

374
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,913
With your arrival on
the Sabaody Archipelago,

375
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,831
there are now 11 people
with bounties

376
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,834
exceeding 100 million
berries on the groves.

377
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,923
There are 11 people
with bounties that high?

378
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,216
[SHAKKY]
That's right.

379
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,593
Adding Roronoa and Monkey
here to the list,

380
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,761
you've got eleven.

381
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,763
So there are nine others.

382
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,806
You had a choice to make

383
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,724
when you crossed the Grand Line.

384
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,018
There were seven sea routes
that would lead you here,

385
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,186
and after you picked one,

386
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,981
you followed your log pose
the rest of the way, right?

387
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:22,940
Mm-hmm.

388
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,900
[SHAKKY] Well naturally,
these other pirates

389
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,486
picked one of the six
routes you chose not to,

390
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,030
and trust me, they went
through just as much trouble

391
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,782
as you did to get here.

392
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,701
It doesn't matter
which route you take,

393
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,744
you eventually hit the Red Line,

394
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,830
and everyone winds up
on this archipelago

395
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,208
with the hopes of getting
past that giant wall.

396
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,794
It's a bit crazy that all
of the world's best rookies

397
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,463
managed to show up here
at the same time, though.

398
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,049
And such a
notorious lot, at that.

399
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,969
At the top you've
got Kid, yourself,

400
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,014
Hawkins, Drake, and Law.

401
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,890
I'm guessing you must've
seen these other names

402
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,059
in the newspapers
alongside your own.

403
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,894
[LUFFY]
I don't read newspapers.

404
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,772
Information is a weapon.

405
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,067
It'd be a smart move to at least
learn the names of your rivals.

406
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,193
Okay, so...

407
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:12,114
There was Kid, Hawkins,
and, uh, it was Drake, right?

408
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,699
They're the ones
with the highest bounties

409
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,908
on their heads.

410
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,828
Of the four names I said,
you've got the second highest.

411
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,913
Someone has a
higher bounty than Luffy?

412
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,498
And they're here?

413
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,141
Her appetite is terrifying.

414
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,186
How can she even fit
all that food into her body?

415
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,521
[BONNEY]
More! Bring more food!

416
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,984
[CAPONE]
What a vulgar woman.

417
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,739
Just the sight of her's
making me lose my appetite.

418
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,699
Go wire her jaw shut.

419
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,785
[FIRETANK PIRATE 392A]
That's not a good idea, Father!

420
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,037
We're right by
Navy headquarters.

421
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,247
The last thing we need's
to cause a scene.

422
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,004
[SHAKKY]
Capone "Gang" Bege.

423
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,758
He has a bounty of 138
million Berries on his head.

424
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,052
[BONNEY]
Where's the rest of the food?

425
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,638
Hurry and bring it
before I starve!

cooking it as fast as they can.

428
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,559
It's on the way.

429
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,646
[BONNEY] Well it's not
fast enough, dammit!

430
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,565
Pizza! More pizza!

431

aka, "the Glutton".

432
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,740
Her bounty: 140 million Berries.

433
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,699
Right.

434
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,243
We'll have your food
for you immediately.

435
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,288

of your pants.

I apologize for my
man threatening you.

442

only bring our crew bad fortune.

for the other side of
the Red Line to fight me?

Just curious, but do you
have any clue who I am?

He's got a bounty of

[UROUGE]
I can wait.

00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,349
Aren't you the fallen

He has a bounty worth
108 million Berries.

474
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,942

get down on your knees

475
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,487
and thank Drake for
your life, masked man.

00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,240
[SHAKKY]
"The Massacre Soldier" Killer.

His bounty, 162 million Berries.

Damn, and it was
just starting to get good.

[LAW]
Hey, Drake.

480
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,507
I'm curious.

00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,343
How many people have you killed?

00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,761
[SHAKKY]

483
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,305
"The Surgeon of Death".

484
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,766
His bounty is
200 million Berries.

485
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,647
[SHAKKY]
As you know,

486
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,232
a countless number
of pirate crews

487
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,900
have entered the Grand Line,

488
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,862
but only a handful
have made it this far.

489
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,323
The Grand Line is
basically an enormous tournament

490
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,866
of survival.

491
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,493
Regardless of which path
they took to get here,

492
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:12,122
the ones that made it
are the cream of the crop.

493
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,790
I'd even go
so far as to say

494
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,334
that one of them
might go on to become

495
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,962
the leader of the next
generation of pirates.

496
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,255
So fair warning.

497
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,342
With this many rookies passing
the Red Line at the same time,

498
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,094
things are bound to get
quite ugly in the New World.

499
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,971
Also, in case
you're wondering why

500
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,058
Captain Kid's bounty is
so much higher than yours,

501
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,434
it's because he has no qualms

502
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,978
with attacking
innocent civilians.

503
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,980

gotta be honest with ya.

But...

510
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,329
You do have me a little afraid

for the old coating
mechanic pirate guy.

512
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,209
This town sounds pretty rough.

513
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,462
[SHAKKY] Oh, you've
got nothing to worry about.

514
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,255
Trust me,
Rayleigh's all right.

515
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,384
He's a hundred times
stronger than you.

516
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,927
Did she say--

517
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,845
A hundred times?

518
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,022
[LUFFY]
Okay!

519
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,899
Let's find that old
coating craftsman guy!

520
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,359
[CHOPPER]
Right!

521
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,485
[LUFFY]
Sabaody Park!

522
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,903
Let's search there first!

523
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,113
[CAMIE]
Good idea!

524
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,240
You never know, he might be
hiding on the Ferris wheel!

525
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,075
[LUFFY and CAMIE]
Right! Time to play!

526
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,868
[PAPPAGU] You're not
trying to find him at all!

527
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,328
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

528
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,621
"The Target is Camie!

529
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,457
The Looming Clutches of a
Professional Kidnapper!"

530
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,210
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
