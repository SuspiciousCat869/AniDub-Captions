1
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,832
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:52,292
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,961
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:56,629
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,713 --> 00:01:00,133
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,596
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:10,393
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:18,193
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:22,697
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:25,909
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,994
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:33,083
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:38,380
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:42,300
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:45,220
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:47,180
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:52,560
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:54,437
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:59,401
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,444
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:07,200
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:14,290
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:22,090
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:31,307
And Impact.

25
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:38,690
[KAMAKIRI]
Burn... Blade!

26
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:47,407
[ENERU] Think you're
faster than lightning?

27
00:02:51,369 --> 00:02:55,331
[KAMKIRI]
Wyper!!

28
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,586
[AISA screams]

29
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:05,633
[AISA] The voices,
they're disappearing!

30
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:09,804
[ENERU] I guess my electricity
traveled down the Milky Road.

31
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:11,806
The stupid fools.

32
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:17,771
[LUFFY] "A Mystical City!
The Grand Ruins of Shandora!"

33
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:25,028
It's amazing.

34
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:27,197
You're incredible, Nami!

35
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:31,910
She's all yours now,
and as good as new!

36
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:33,745
[NAMI]
Yeah! Thanks!

37
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:36,373
I don't know what
you did, but I love it.

38
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:38,375
This thing is
so fast it's crazy!

39
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,709
[PAGAYA]
It's true,

40
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:42,796
and Jet Dials went extinct
hundreds of years ago.

41
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,589
It's really quite astonishing.

42
00:03:44,673 --> 00:03:45,965
Imagine how shocked I was

43
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:48,968
to find one onboard
the waver you left.

44
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:52,430
I fear we're running out of
things to occupy ourselves with.

45
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:55,058
We had planned to lead all
of you to the end of Skypeia,

46
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:57,644
but it seems our
circumstances have changed.

47
00:03:57,727 --> 00:03:58,978
[NAMI]
Hmm...

48
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:00,480
I guess the best thing to do

49
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:03,108
is get the ship to the coast
where we all agreed to meet.

50
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,484
There's really
no reason to worry.

51
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:06,111
I'm sure they're fine.

52
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:08,905
You know, when the four of
those goofballs get together,

53
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:10,490
there's practically
no stopping 'em.

54
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:12,575
[AISA] There aren't
any four-man groups.

55
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,744
[NAMI]
Huh?

56
00:04:14,828 --> 00:04:16,955
At the most there's maybe two.

57
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:19,124
If there were a four-man
group on the island

58
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:21,584
I'd know about it, and I don't.

59
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,753
It's Mantra.

60
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:28,133
That's the power that Eneru
and his Priests use, huh?

61
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:30,051
I was born able to use it.

62
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:33,555
That's why...
That's why I'm so afraid.

63
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:38,435
You have no idea how scary
it is to hear voices disappear!

64
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:41,062
You're not crying
again, are you?

65
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:42,105
No, I'm not crying!

66
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:44,274
You stupid Blue Sea person!

67
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:45,775
Her waver had broken down.

68
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,944
Luckily our boat
happened to pass by.

69
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:49,696
If we hadn't gotten
to her when we did,

70
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:52,032
she would've been
eaten by a sky shark.

71
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:54,117
What were you thinking
coming out here by yourself?

72
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,618
I dunno.

73
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:58,997
But... I couldn't keep
sitting around doing nothing.

74
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,878
[AISA]
Laki, and everbody.

75
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:09,507
[distant crash]

76
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:12,218
[NAMI]
I hope everyone is all right.

77
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:21,644
[LUFFY's stomach growls]

78
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:29,819
Ugh! What a day.

79
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:31,488
This is crappy.

80
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:34,908
I'm starving and I left
my bag outside this stupid cave,

81
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:37,327
and all the fruit trees
around here are rotten.

82
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,536
And all I can think about

83
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,956
is eating that yummy
breakfast Sanji made.

84
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,876
What kind of messed up cave
did I wind up in anyway?

85
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,754
Can't seem to find
an exit anywhere.

86
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:50,131
[LUFFY] I wonder if
everybody's already made it

87
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:51,758
to the City of Gold.

88
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:54,844
I bet it's all pretty and
shiny and golden and stuff.

89
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:57,889
And they probably make all
kinds of good food there too.

90
00:05:57,972 --> 00:06:00,392
I can't wait to
get there and find out.

91
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:11,945
[ZORO grunts]

92
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:14,864
Feels like I've been
walking forever.

93
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:17,033
I think I'll have
that lunch now.

94
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,206
This stuff ain't too shabby.

95
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:25,166
Who's there?

96
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:29,754
Aww.

97
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:32,090
Sorry, fella,
but I don't speak bird.

98
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:33,925
And if it's
my food you're after. Hey!

99
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:34,884
Aww.

100
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:36,678
You're not getting it!

101
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:39,139
Stop staring at me!

102
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:51,151
Would you stop following me?

103
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:52,402
Aww.

104
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:54,320
Listen feather brain,
I just ate all my food.

105
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:56,072
I don't have anymore, okay?

106
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:58,033
Besides I wouldn't give
you any even if I had some,

107
00:06:58,116 --> 00:07:00,493
so get lost before
I lose my temper!

108
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:01,661
Aww.

109
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:02,912
What is your problem anyhow?

110
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:04,789
Walking all weird with
your big fat melon head

111
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:07,125
facing the wrong direction.

112
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,419
I don't want to have
to fight you bird, but I will.

113
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:10,754
Got it?

114
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:13,256
Aww.

115
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:16,968
[ENERU] In three hours,
a mere five of the 81 people

116
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:19,554
on this island will
be left standing.

117
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,682
[ENERU]
There's only one hour left

118
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:25,185
until my proclaimed time is up,

119
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:29,314
and 25 survivors
currently remain.

120
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:32,192
[SHANDORAN]
This can't be!

121
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:34,361
What's Eneru doing here?

122
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:36,905
[SHANDORAN]
He's going down!

123
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:42,410
Huh?

124
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,544
[ENERU]
And now, 24.

125
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:57,467
[YAMA laughs]

126
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:03,723
Well, it seems all your
talk doesn't amount to much.

127
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:11,147
Stomach Mountain!

128
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:18,321
[ROBIN]
A runic statue!

129
00:08:18,405 --> 00:08:21,116
Veinte Fleurs! Calendula!

130
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,089
[YAMA] How long
are you going to insist

131
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:40,176
on protecting this withered,
good for nothing old city?

132
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,761
Indefinitely.

133
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:47,892
Why must you disrespect what our
ancestors had held so sacred?

134
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:49,394
[YAMA]
Huh?

135
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:52,272
The past has nothing to do
with me so why should I care?

136
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:53,732
That doesn't surprise me.

137
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:56,234
Only the foolish
say such things.

138
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:57,444
[YAMA growls]

139
00:08:57,527 --> 00:09:00,822
How dare you insult
someone so powerful!

140
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:03,450
Super Punch Mountain!

141
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,535
[ROBIN] I've got to get
away from these ruins

142
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:08,413
before this simpleton
destroys what's left of them!

143
00:09:26,514 --> 00:09:29,559
[ROBIN] Back then, I believed
my quest had been lost.

144
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:30,852
My dreams were buried

145
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:34,314
along with the underground
temple of Alabasta.

146
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:39,027
Having lost everything,
I chose to travel with Luffy.

147
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,612
But these ruins
could hold the clues

148
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:44,908
to an unspoken history that's
been lost to the world below!

149
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:03,218
[YAMA]
How long do you plan on running?

150
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:36,042
I don't understand it.

151
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:39,462
You've finally
decided to face me?

152
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:40,547
[ROBIN]
Yes.

153
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,799
It's too late for you.

154
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:45,427
[YAMA]
Huh? Too late?

155
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,053
Even if you choose to repent.

156
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:50,265
I won't forgive you.

157
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:52,726
Oh, you won't forgive me? I see.

158
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:55,645
All because of these
shabby old ruins you adore.

159
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:59,607
A pile of rubble that doesn't
even belong to you?

160
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:03,695
[ROBIN] That's right. Those
ruins don't belong to anyone.

161
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:07,240
I've grown tired of this,
and I'm tired of talking to you.

162
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:09,159
Well, not to worry.

163
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:10,660
In just a few short moments,

164
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:12,746
you won't have to
talk to me ever again

165
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:14,080
because unfortunately,

166
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:16,499
you're going to be crushed
to death underneath me!

167
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,251
Drop Mountain!

168
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:23,089
I can unleash all of
my power on you in this place!

169
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:24,716
Treinta Fleurs!

170
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:30,930
[ROBIN] All you do is charge
around like a clumsy bull.

171
00:11:31,014 --> 00:11:33,141
With no regard for
the weight of the history

172
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:35,477
that you've destroyed!

173
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,896
Hang!

174
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:43,526
His body's too heavy.

175
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,543
I'll chop you to ribbons!

176
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:04,547
The Ten Axe Mountain!

177
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,066
My eyes! I can't see!

178
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,529
Ah! What are you doing?

179
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:29,489
Why did you turn the
dials around backwards?

180
00:12:29,572 --> 00:12:31,741
You're gonna kill me!

181
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:53,930
What you have
carelessly destroyed

182
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:55,432
were priceless treasures.

183
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:58,059
Relics so rare it would
be next to impossible

184
00:12:58,143 --> 00:13:00,478
to measure their actual worth.

185
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,772
It's true that history
may repeat itself,

186
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:05,608
but people can't
go back in time.

187
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:09,029
A stupid brute like you
wouldn't understand that.

188
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:12,365
I, uh... I... I understand.

189
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:15,827
Please. Please, I'm sorry.

190
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,620
Won't you forgive me?

191
00:13:17,704 --> 00:13:19,372
That's out of the question.

192
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:22,792
Ah... Ah...

193
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:24,044
Well, in that case,

194
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:26,629
I'll have to kill
you then, won't I?

195
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:32,135
[screams]

196
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:35,055
My fingers! My fingers!

197
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:37,140
Cien Fleurs!

198
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:41,519
[ROBIN]
Delphinium!

199
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,734
[YAMA]
No! No!

200
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:53,031
[YAMA]
Stop!

201
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:55,617
I'm afraid it's far
too late for that.

202
00:13:57,202 --> 00:14:00,205
Can't... breathe.

203
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:06,920
[ROBIN]
Clutch!

204
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:21,059
That was certainly unpleasant.

205
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:37,200
[ROBIN] This should be
the center of the city.

206
00:14:37,283 --> 00:14:41,287
But it doesn't match up at all
with the map on the monument.

207
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:43,373
I wonder if the entire
city was broken up

208
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:45,875
when it was thrust into the sky?

209
00:14:58,805 --> 00:15:00,098
[COBRA]
I don't understand.

210
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:02,892
Then why did you come here?

211
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:06,146
I don't really know anymore.

212
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:08,481
Chasing a dream, I suppose.

213
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:10,400
An empty dream.

214
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:13,653
The last remaining
Poneglyph in the world

215
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:17,574
that still carries
the "true history."

216
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,454
[ROBIN]
The Rio Poneglyph.

217
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:27,208
What do you mean
by the "true history"?

218
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:29,002
Nothing.

219
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:30,587
It doesn't matter now.

220
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,755
For 20 years I've searched,

221
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:34,632
and I've never had
a better lead than this.

222
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:36,426
This was my last hope.

223
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:38,094
And it didn't work out.

224
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:41,389
So if I'm going to die here,
it's the perfect time.

225
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,683
I'm tired of this
fool's crusade.

226
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:45,685
It's over.

227
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:53,693
All I wanted, was to
learn our true history

228
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:57,781
and to share it
with the whole world.

229
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:03,013
[ROBIN]
It's so strange.

230
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:06,474
Could this really
be the City of Gold?

231
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,271
The size and the topography
are all completely different.

232
00:17:11,354 --> 00:17:13,356
Hmm...

233
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,072
[ROBIN] And what's
most unnatural of all.

234
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:23,658
The only entrance is at the top!

235
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:30,999
[ROBIN]
Could it be?

236
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:01,654
I think I can go below.

237
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,420
[ROBIN]
It's so vast.

238
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:20,799
The ruins really
do go much deeper.

239
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,384
I thought it was bizarre

240
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:26,388
that all these Blue Sea Ruins
had Island Clouds for ground.

241
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:28,723
[ROBIN]
The ruins above are nothing more

242
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,225
than the upper
parts of the city,

243
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:32,310
eaten up by Island Clouds.

244
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,312
There's still more below.

245
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:04,968
[ROBIN]
Light!

246
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:37,208
It's all so incredible.

247
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:39,794
The ancient city collapsed
eight hundred years ago.

248
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,547
But I can hardly believe
it's been that long.

249
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,924
It's still so majestic
and grand.

250
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:47,218
I've actually found it.

251
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:49,471
This really is
the great Shandora.

252
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:51,681
The City of Gold!

253
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,623
[ROBIN]
It can't be!

254
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,966
So then you're saying,

255
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,760
that it's possible
our lost history

256
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:31,179
could actually be uncovered?

257
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:34,974
And the Poneglyphs are the
key to unlocking these records?

258
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,902
The ancient Poneglyph symbols.

259
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:50,115
So the Shandorians
were familiar with them.

260
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:52,283
But only the ones
who made the Poneglyphs

261
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,452
were able to read them.

262
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:59,249
We shall know the true meaning
and utter it to no one.

263
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:02,460
It's our legacy to be the
inheritors of history.

264
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:07,882
With the sounding
of the grand belfry.

265
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,134
That's right.

266
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:11,636
I remember Noland's
old logbook mentioning

267
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,888
a giant gold bell being here,

268
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:17,892
but if that's true,
where could it be?

269
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:22,188
All of the city's ancient
writings were burned in a fire.

270
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:27,485
[ROBIN] The entire history of
this place was eradicated.

271
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:35,118
They'll all manage
somehow, right?

272
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:37,746
They've come through
this kind of stuff before.

273
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,753
Quit following me!

274
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,254
Aww.

275
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,383
Sure goes down a long way.

276
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:57,640
[ROBIN] A Poneglyph
was carried into the city!

277
00:21:57,724 --> 00:21:59,142
There's no question about it.

278
00:21:59,225 --> 00:22:01,436
The city faced great hostility.

279
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,855
Shandora. The mystical
City of Gold.

280
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:07,859
Fought and fell to
protect that Poneglyph.

281
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,280
And that means,

282
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,368
the grand belfry located in
the center of the four altars.

283
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:19,371
It could contain the
text of the true history.

284
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:23,166
It could be, the Rio Poneglyph!

285
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:29,964
<i>You can't stop me now,</i>
<i>I'm always going...</i>

286
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,551
<i>A to Z, I run</i>
<i>without stopping...</i>

287
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:37,555
<i>Sometimes I worry,</i>
<i>I'm not gonna make it...</i>

288
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:41,142
<i>But I know that,</i>
<i>it's just a little farther...</i>

289
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,437
<i>The sea's spread before us,</i>
<i>and our cares are behind...</i>

290
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:48,942
<i>The sunrise climbs to the sky,</i>
<i>what will we find?</i>

291
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:52,028
<i>Come with me,</i>
<i>follow the shining sun...</i>

292
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:57,242
<i>Watch the horizon,</i>
<i>the journey's just begun...</i>

293
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:00,286
<i>I, never treat you bad...</i>

294
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,205
<i>Even when we fail...</i>

295
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:05,792
<i>(It's) all right,</i>
<i>we still can't give up now...</i>

296
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,585
<i>('Cause) You and I both know...</i>

297
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,504
<i>(Through) every high and low...</i>

298
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:12,257
<i>We sail towards tomorrow...</i>

299
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,675
<i>So SMILE!!</i>

300
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,552
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

301
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:19,389
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

302
00:23:19,472 --> 00:23:21,224
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

303
00:23:21,307 --> 00:23:25,061
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

304
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:28,231
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

305
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:44,039
[ZORO]
Hey!

306
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,082
Where are you taking me,
you stupid bird?

307
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,709
[LUFFY]
What's with this goofy cave?

308
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,169
And where's the exit?

309
00:23:49,252 --> 00:23:51,588
[ZORO] Something really
ticked that snake off!

310
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:55,133
[NAMI screams] Why's this
crazy snake chasing us?

311
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:57,969
[ZORO] Hmm. All these
guys seem pretty tough.

312
00:23:58,053 --> 00:23:59,637
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

313
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,306
"0% Survival Rate!

314
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:04,768
Chopper vs. Ohm,
the Sword Wielding Priest!"

315
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:07,395
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
