these rebellious ideas.

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:11.530
[CHOPPER]
Us?!

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:14.333
They chose to leave this awful
place of their own free will!

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:16.769
[ZORO]
That's enough! Outta my way!

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:18.370
[ZORO grunts]

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:30.282
Go on, hurry up!

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:31.784
[ROBIN, NAMI]
Mm.

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:32.818
[ROBIN]
Follow me.

00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:33.819
[NAMI]
Right!

00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:37.056
[CHOPPER] Hang in there,
Mocha! We're on our way!

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.996
[MONET]
That's not very nice.

00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:46.465
[ZORO chuckles]

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:49.668
[MONET]
Since the first day

00:12:49.702 --> 00:12:51.871
they came to live on
the island with us,

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:54.340
we've treated those
children with every comfort

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:56.842
and kindness they
could ever want.

00:12:57.843 --> 00:13:00.646
[MONET] And yet you're trying to
steal these beloved treasures

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.682
from their adoring
foster parents.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.819
But I suppose you are pirates.

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:10.489
Heh. If you expect it,
then you must be fine with it.

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:13.125
[MONET]
I told you it's not nice.

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:15.928
You're done interfering.

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:17.530
Sword Snow!

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:21.433
[MONET]
Skin Sword technique!

00:13:45.724 --> 00:13:50.729
[MOMONOSUKE yelling]

00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:00.706
Keep climbing! Maybe
we can get out this way!

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:05.744
[yelling]

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:10.549
--[MOMONOSUKE groans]
--[LUFFY] Wait, why'd you stop?

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.117
What's wrong?!

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:19.124
[MOMONOSUKE groaning]

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:23.729
[MOMONOSUKE panting]

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:26.265
I'm not hungry.

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:29.134
Not the slightest bit hungry.

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:31.637
O-Of course not.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.205
[stomach rumbles]

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:34.106
Huh?

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:35.808
--[MOMONOSUKE groans]
--[LUFFY] Uh?

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.513
[grunts, gasps]

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:53.192
[LUFFY screaming]

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:03.269
[CAESAR CLOWN] Oh dear,
Monet's gotten sidetracked.

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:06.272
At this rate,
the children will escape!

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:08.941
Heh. Well, no matter.
If that happens,

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:13.212
we can kidnap ourselves a
new batch of guinea pigs later.

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:15.915
Our greatest priority is
providing a showcase for

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:19.151
Land of the Dead and
eliminating the Straw Hats.

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:21.053
Fortunately for us,

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:25.624
the gas is flowing steadily
into the building as we speak.

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:30.930
[CAESAR CLOWN chuckles]

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:38.370
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Building B will soon be

00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:41.307
completely filled with gas.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.577
Then they'll be forced
to head into Building R.

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:47.112
But it's only a matter of time

00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:49.315
before the gas
eradicates them all.

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:55.554
[cackles]

00:15:55.587 --> 00:16:00.292
[BOTH] Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:07.232
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:09.535
How did all that
gas get in here?

00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:12.438
I thought all the entrances
had been sealed off!

00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:14.306
[BROOK]
There must be a leak somewhere!

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.075
Well, that's just great!

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:17.209
If that's the case,

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:19.445
then it's not safe to stay
in this building anymore!

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:21.780
We're running outta time!

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:24.016
I think we'd better split up
to find those handcuffs quick!

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:26.085
Split again?

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:28.153
I suppose there's no choice.

00:16:28.187 --> 00:16:30.589
Brook, you and Kin'emon
go together, okay?

00:16:30.622 --> 00:16:31.790
I'll be fine,

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.826
but I'm afraid our samurai
friend here might lose his way!

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:34.994
Good thinking!

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:37.363
I am grateful to you,
Sir Skeleton!

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:39.131
[USOPP]
Meet you in Building R!

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:40.532
[KIN'EMON, BROOK]
Right!

00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:53.846
Y'know, I've noticed that all

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:55.981
you've been doing
is defending yourself.

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.383
So is there some reason

00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:59.918
why you haven't tried
to attack me at all?

00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:07.960
[MONET] Oh, my.
I think I know what it is.

00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:09.128
That's funny.

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:12.064
At first I thought there was
no way I could defeat you.

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:16.135
How about that?
I guess I was mistaken.

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:18.270
[MARINES panting]

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:20.005
[PIKE]
There's another room back here!

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:23.075
[MARINE A] Find the children and
get them out as fast as you can!

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:25.611
[MARINE B] It feels
like a snowstorm in here!

00:17:25.644 --> 00:17:27.079
The Navy?

00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:29.214
[SANJI] Come on,
let's bust the door open!

00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:30.816
[MARINES]
Yeah!

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.487
It doesn't matter
how many of you

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.923
come to take
those children away.

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:39.191
I'll stop you!

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:43.262
[MARINES yelling]

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:45.030
[SANJI]
This way!

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:47.433
Save those kids!

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:49.701
[ALL yelling]

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:52.671
Why are all those
Marines answering to you?

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:53.705
They're not here!

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:57.509
The only person I can see
is Pirate Hunter Zoro!

00:17:57.543 --> 00:18:00.079
Of course that
pain-in-the-ass is here.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.648
[SANJI]
All right, here's the plan.

00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:06.351
Everybody make dumb
faces at Mosshead!

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:07.219
[ZORO growls]

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:08.854
[SANJI, MARINES]
Ugh!

00:18:08.887 --> 00:18:10.355
[ZORO]
I hope they all slip on the ice

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:12.925
and crack their
stupid skulls open.

00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.259
[ZORO sighs]

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:17.496
Jackass. Nami and Robin
already went that way.

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:19.565
Why don't you go chase 'em down?

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:23.235
Gotcha! I knew you would
be useful to me one day!

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:26.605
You heard him, boys,
let's go find the-- [gasps]

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:36.014
[SANJI] Nevermind,
we've got a hottie right here!

00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:38.951
[MARINES yell]
Shake those tail feathers!

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:42.821
[ZORO] Oh, come on! Pick your
jaws up off the floor, morons!

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:43.555
[MARINES growl]

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:45.457
Wait. Just look at her though.

00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:48.427
She's half-woman, half-bird!

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.263
[MARINE B]
No way! A real-life harpy.

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:53.932
[MARINE C]
Huh?!

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:55.868
Yeah, but hey,

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:58.470
human or not, she
sure is a looker, right?

00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:00.339
Sexiest bird I've ever seen!

00:19:00.372 --> 00:19:01.840
Yeah, I could be into that!

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:03.142
[MARINES]
Woo-hoo!

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:05.878
Call me crazy, but I think
you're actually enjoying this!

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:06.678
[MONET gasps]

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:08.247
Woo, yeah!

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.517
Hey, why's it snowing?
Aren't we inside?

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.185
Huh?

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:15.787
Yeah, you're right.

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:22.227
[MONET chuckles]
That would be my doing.

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:27.933
It's so cold!

00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:29.635
It's my duty after all.

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:31.069
I don't care who you are.

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:35.741
It'll be a cold day in hell when
I let you take those children.

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:37.809
[MARINE G gasps]

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:40.245
[MARINE H]
Uh, uh, she's gone!

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.414
Oh, great. Where did she go now?

Whoa, you okay, man?

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:05.237
[groans] It's my shoulder!

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.772
She bit it off!

You'll pay for that!

[MARINES cheering]

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:10.335
[MARINE S]
Captain Tashigi!

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:11.536
[TASHIGI]
We sealed off the doors

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.139
to keep the gas from
getting into this room.

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:17.276
[TASHIGI]
But we don't know that it won't

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:19.311
leak in from another spot.

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:21.813
We don't have much time!

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:24.983
So do whatever it takes and
rescue all of the children!

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:25.717
Wha--?

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:28.553
But what about you?

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:30.889
I'm going to stay right here.

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:32.224
[MARINES]
Huh?

00:21:49.608 --> 00:21:52.110
So what do you plan to do?

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:54.179
[MONET chuckles]

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.160
If you ask me, you could
use a little help here.

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:10.262
What?

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:20.505
[NARRATOR] Tashigi uses her
Haki to sqaure with Monet,

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:23.241
who wields the mighty power of
the Snow Snow Fruit.

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:25.010
However, when the
vengeful bird-woman

00:22:25.043 --> 00:22:27.245
retaliates with her sharp fangs,

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:29.614
Tashigi's shoulder
is almost crushed.

00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:33.051
Just then, Zoro's
animal-like instincts kick in.

00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:34.753
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:34.786 --> 00:22:36.621
"Showing Off His Techniques!

00:22:36.655 --> 00:22:39.157

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.860
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
