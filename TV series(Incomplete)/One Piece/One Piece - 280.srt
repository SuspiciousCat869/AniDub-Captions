1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,137
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,573
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,341
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:10,644
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,112
You want my treasure?

6
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,213
You can have it!

7
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,216
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:19,419
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:24,224
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,493
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,729
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,283
Look! The drawbridge
is lowering!

13
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,353
Our reinforcements
pulled it together after all.

14
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,288
And just in time, too.

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,596
I'm trembling with excitement!

16
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,299
Hey, Robin! We'll
save you! No matter what!

17
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,303
Come on, hurry up!

18
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,206
Lookin' scary there, Zoro.

19
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,481
So, I hear you're a bad guy.

20
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,749
Are you still here?

21
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,619
You're stuck out here for all
the world to see and nothing.

22
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,120
Are you really all that strong?

23
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,155
Mind your own business!

24
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,459
When I joined up with Luffy,

25
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,127
I never thought it
would bring me here.

26
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,792
Now die!

27
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,565
You're weak, Zoro.
Nothing ever changes.

28
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,770
I made a promise to her.

29
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:27,440
And I can't afford to
die in a place like this.

30
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,421
You again?
Don't you have things to do?

31
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:43,324
I'll untie you, but only if
you promise to join my crew.

32
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,558
Your what?

33
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:48,228
I run a pirate crew and I'm
looking for people to join up.

34
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,632
No way! I'd never stoop
to joining up with a criminal.

35
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,167
Screw that business.

36
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,202
And what's wrong
with being a pirate?

37
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,103
They're despicable.

38
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,671
Like I'd ever wanna
join up with one.

39
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,872
Oh, come on! Gimme a break!

40
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,508
Everyone already knows you
as some vicious bounty hunter,

41
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,043
always out for blood.

42
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,446
People can say whatever
they want about me.

43
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,515
But I've never done a single
thing in my life that I regret.

44
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,418
I will make it
through this challenge.

45
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,455
And after that,
I'll accomplish what I want.

46
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,590
Yeah. That's great.

47
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,393
But I've already decided that
you're going to be on my crew.

48
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,761
What? You can't do that!

49
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,796
I hear you're one of
the best swordsmen around.

50
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,700
Well, I am. But that idiot
Captain's son took mine away.

51
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,602
Guess I'll just have
to go get it back for you.

52
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,236
What?

53
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,604
So if you want your sword,

54
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,406
you're just gonna
have to join my crew.

55
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,207
Now you're really
pissing me off!

56
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,579
Wait. He's actually
gonna bust in there alone?

57
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,115
Do not let that man escape!

58
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,550
Captain! There's someone
in the crucifixion yard!

59
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,684
What?

60
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,460
I'm surrounded by traitors!

61
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,596
You have to get
out of here, Zoro.

62
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,565
That maniac's going to kill you
for what you're doing right now!

63
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,601
I can't stand to watch
the Marines behave

64
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,169
like this anymore.

65
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:05,172
A true Marine
should be honorable.

66
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,341
Look, kid. I can't leave.

67
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,276
I got ten days left.
And then they're--

68
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,143
Well, not quite.

69
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,478
They're gonna
execute you tomorrow.

70
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,479
They're what?

71
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,115
Helmeppo never intended
to honor your agreement.

72
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,351
He's planned on killing
you from the start.

73
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:21,021
Which made Luffy really angry,
so he just knocked him out.

74
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,357
He did?

75
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,525
Now that the Marines are mad,

76
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,227
they're dead-set
on catching Luffy.

77
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,228
Don't worry.

78
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,164
I'm not gonna ask you to
become a pirate, though.

79
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,699
But I hope you'll help him.

80
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,334
You have a lot of
strength you can offer.

81
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,273
Luffy's the only person here

82
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,775
who can actually save
you from execution.

83
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:47,081
And, of course, you're the
only one who can save him,

84
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:49,216
from a very similar fate.

85
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:52,552
End of the line!

86
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,531
You've been pulling some
interesting moves around here.

87
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,365
What is this?

88
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,269
Some kind of poorly
executed coup

89
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,604
you two planned
with the Straw Hat?

90
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,307
I've always fought alone,
like a real man does.

91
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,608
Not like a coward,

92
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:18,078
who hides behind his wall
of expendable cronies.

93
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,616
Roronoa Zoro. Don't you
dare underestimate me.

94
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,719
You may be a strong fighter,
but under my authority,

95
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,589
you're just the rat we
throw out with the trash.

96
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,291
Take aim!

97
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:31,324
No.

98
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,396
I can't afford to die here!

99
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,770
You're weak, Zoro.
Nothing ever changes.

100
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,242
Gum Gum--

101
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,443
Rocket!

102
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,477
Fire!

103
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,215
What?

104
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:55,783
Luffy, no!

105
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,317
Straw Hat!

106
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,757
See ya!

107
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,565
That won't work on me!
Told you I was strong!

108
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,635
What the--?
Who the hell are you?

109
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,404
My name's Monkey D. Luffy.

110
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,074
And I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates.

111
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,743
Right. You must be completely
out of you rubbery mind.

112
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,179
Do you have any
idea what that means?

113
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:28,082
King of the Pirates means
King of the Pirates.

114
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,217
How could it mean
anything other than that?

115
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,321
Yeah, when he first
told me, it was shocking,

116
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,090
but he's completely serious.

117
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,658
That's how he is, I suppose.

118
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,460
Cause he actually seems
to have every intention

119
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,395
of becoming King of the Pirates,

120
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,430
and obtaining the
world's ultimate treasure.

121
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,764
The One Piece.

122
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,637
Here's what I promised you.

123
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,871
There's three.

124
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:53,641
I couldn't tell which was yours
so I just took all of them.

125
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,676
All of them belong to me.

126
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,545
I use santoryu,
the three swords style.

127
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,481
Take 'em already!

128
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,816
Just know that if
you fight with me now,

129
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,818
you'll be a government
defying villian.

130
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,288
So it's either that,
or you're left out here

131
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,556
and killed by the
marines execution style.

132
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,060
What are you, the son of
the devil? It doesn't matter.

133
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,295
Cause if I don't
choose your side,

134
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,797
I'll just end up
dead on these sticks.

135
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,298
So let's do it.

136
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,702
So you're finally
gonna join my crew!

137
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,505
This is the best
thing ever! All right!

138
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,140
Would you quit
celebrating already

139
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,641
and get these ropes off me?

140
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,310
What the--? What is he?

141
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,178
The bullets just
bounced right off him!

142
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,415
Straw Hat's no ordinary
human like the rest of us.

143
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,083
He must have eaten
one of those devil fruits

144
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,785
that we've heard all
those rumors about.

145
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,186
Devil Fruit?

146
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,387
Come on! Hurry!

147
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,190
They got these
things on here tight!

148
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,625
Come on! Quit screwing around!

149
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,827
It doesn't matter
what abilities they have,

150
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,096
all who oppose me are executed!

151
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:52,098
If the guns won't work, we chop!

152
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,004
That's funny.

153
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,372
The knots got tighter
instead of looser.

154
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,640
Give me one of
my damn swords now!

155
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,711
Luffy, look!

156
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,322
Roronoa Zoro!

157
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:18,358
Wow! That's so cool!

158
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,028
Make one move and you die.

159
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,030
He's scary!

160
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,036
Today I officially
become a criminal,

161
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,471
having fought the Marines.

162
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:33,440
So, I'll become a pirate.
That, I can promise you.

163
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,310
But I want you to know one
thing, while I'm with you,

164
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:40,080
the only thing I dedicate myself
to is fulfilling my ambition!

165
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,281
Which is?

166
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,051
To be nothing less than the
world's greatest swordsman.

167
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,620
If somewhere along the
way I have to give that up,

168
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,123
then I want you to
accept responsibility.

169
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:52,226
After which you get
to apologize to me.

170
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,429
The world's greatest swordsman.
Sounds pretty good.

171
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,564
The King of the Pirates
wouldn't have any less

172
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,200
than the best on his crew.

173
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,401
Big talker.

174
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,138
From this point on, no matter
if I'm a criminal or not,

175
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:07,140
I will spread the name
Zoro throughout the world!

176
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,176
What are standing
there frozen for?

177
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,045
I want you to kill all
three of them right now!

178
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,315
You might wanna duck.

179
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:19,019
Gum-Gum Whip!

180
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,391
Yes! You knocked 'em all down!

181
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,694
Wanna tell me what you are?

182
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,597
I'm just a guy who
ate the Gum-Gum fruit.

183
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,599
What's the Gum-Gum fruit?

184
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,700
A rubber person?

185
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:35,469
It looks like he does
have the Devil Fruit powers.

186
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,538
Captain, we don't stand
a chance against them!

187
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:39,540
Yeah, just look at them!
They're insane!

188
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:42,142
We couldn't even take
on Zoro by himself!

189
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,813
This is a direct order.

190
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:48,048
Every marine that just
spouted weakness,

191
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,750
pull your gun out
and shoot yourself.

192
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,452
I can't do anything
with weak soldiers!

193
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:58,491
What babies. This'll be easy.

194
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,463
Luffy!

195
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,398
Bring those Marines
crumbling to their knees!

196
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,342
Rankless, low-life bums!

197
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,212
You have no right
to defy my superiority!

198
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,014
I am Marine Captain
"Axe-Hand" Morgan!

199
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,619
And I'm Luffy. Nice to meet ya.

200
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,565
Look! He's been hit!

201
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,568
You runt.

202
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,471
Now die!

203
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,106
I don't think so!

204
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,010
The Captain's getting
pummeled out there!

205
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,214
It's embarrassing.

206
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:56,817
You call yourself a Marine.

207
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,519
But you destroyed
my friend Coby's dream.

208
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,524
Straw Hat! Stop right there!
Look at what I got!

209
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,495
Are you stupid or
something? I said stop!

210
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,496
If you would pay
attention to me,

211
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,665
I have a hostage here
you might wanna look at!

212
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,634
Helmeppo's crazy!

213
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,168
Hey.

214
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,805
If you value your
squatty little friend's life

215
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,506
you won't move a muscle!

216
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,309
I'm serious one move
and I'll shoot him! I swear!

217
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,318
Luffy, listen!

218
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:34,054
Don't let anything that happens
to me stop you no matter what!

219
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,289
Even if I die!

220
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,123
Of course. You got it.

221
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,460
You hear that, you big idiot?

222
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:42,195
Coby is ready to
die by your hand.

223
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,197
Don't you move!

224
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,133
I said don't move or
I'll shoot! I swear it!

225
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,236
Luffy! Behind you!

226
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,704
Gum Gum.

227
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:51,771
Time's up.

228
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:56,744
For I am fearless Marine
Captain "Axe-Hand" Morgan!

229
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,412
Daddy, hurry up
and kill him already!

230
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,180
Pistol!

231
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,652
Nice one!

232
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,130
Thank you.

233
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,465
I'm just doing my job, Captain.

234
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,165
What happened? Why'd it stop?

235
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,034
Damn those marines!
They really piss me off!

236
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,037
Stop getting in the way!

237
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,741
Don't worry about
those tremors, Robin.

238
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:04,678
Like I said, I'm just
trembling with excitement.

239
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,714
We will save you.
No matter what happens.

240
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,186
Well, you said there's a
whole bunch of bad guys, right?

241
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,555
And you look scared
out of your mind.

242
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:17,057
For your information
I have nerves of steel,

243
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,393
I'm perfectly okay
with tons of bad guys!

244
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,329
After all, you're looking at the
legendary Captain Usopp,

245
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,397
brave warrior of the high seas!

246
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,435
Dammit!

247
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,104
Alright, fine I'm scared!

248
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:32,339
Why shouldn't I be,
they're Captain Kuro's men!

249
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,041
These guys mean business!

250
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,309
I don't need pity!

251
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:38,379
If you guys are sticking round
cause you pity me, just leave!

252
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:39,780
I don't need you laughing at me!

253
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,615
We're not laughing at you.

254
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,384
We're helping because
you are honorable.

255
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,355
You really think we'd
risk our lives out of pity?

256
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,430
Aw. You guys!

257
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,666
Usopp!

258
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:10,210
It hurts. It hurts
so bad, I can't move.

259
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,081
Even if you did somehow
catch up to Jango,

260
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,684
he'd end your life
in the blink of an eye.

261
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:19,319
Staying there is
what's best for you.

262
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:22,522
I don't care.

263
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:26,594
I don't care that
I'm weak. I'll protect them.

264
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:29,195
I'm Captain of
the Usopp Pirates!

265
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,400
A brave warrior of the sea who
fights for what he holds dear!

266
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,370
I will protect everyone in
the village if it kills me!

267
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:42,609
On my word you will never
set foot in that village!

268
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,347
What's his deal?

269
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,748
He's yellin' about something!

270
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,616
Check it out! He's crying!

271
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:05,031
What's so funny?

272
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:11,038
Luffy! Me and Usopp are gonna
chase down that hypno-freak.

273
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,339
Is that a problem?

274
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,241
No! Hurry!

275
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,814
Looks like you're one
step too late, swordsman!

276
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,249
Wouldn't say that!

277
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,655
Excellent! That branch was
getting in the way of my shot!

278
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,292
What?

279
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,126
Usopp, you're here!

280
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,461
Now! Time for
the Exploding Star!

281
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,269
You're really doing it.

282
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,104
You're going to
take to the ocean.

283
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,240
Yeah. I've decided to get going

284
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:48,642
before I have time
to change my mind.

285
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,680
Please, don't stop me.

286
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:55,616
I won't. I know it's
time for you to go.

287
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,585
Kaya don't be sad about it.

288
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,154
Just think the next
time I come back here,

289
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,722
I'll tell you about adventures

290
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,358
that'll sound more like
lies than my old lies.

291
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:08,194
Good. I'll look forward to it.

292
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:12,199
You guys take care!
I hope we meet again sometime!

293
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,667
How come?

294
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,738
Well, because I-- Are you
antisocial or something?

295
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,607
I'm taking off for
life on the high seas

296
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,276
and I hope that we'll eventually
meet again that's all.

297
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,246
What are you talking
about? Get on already!

298
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,380
Huh?

299
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,715
We're friends,
right? So, get on.

300
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,292
This is it.

301
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,263
I'm really a pirate Captain now!

302
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:46,032
Don't be stupid, Usopp!
I'm the Captain!

303
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:01,115
Hey! Straw Hats!

304
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,284
Why are you all
just standing around?

305
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:04,685
We're not "standing around"!

306
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:06,587
The bridge broke --
there's no way over!

307
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,322
It's halfway down, isn't it?

308
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,323
That's more than enough.

309
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,059
I'll be there in
about 4 seconds.

310
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,260
Jump into the waterfall!

311
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,762
Give it all
you've got! Trust me!

312
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,133
Monster Granny?
What did she say?

313
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,168
Well she said jump
into the waterfall.

314
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,373
Look, it's the sea train!

315
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,644
Hey. What's with
that devious chuckle?

316
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,655
Let's go!

317
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:13,787
This is On-Location
Tsubaki, a shady reporter

318
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,756
who'll be helping us
out with this report.

319
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:18,092
His favorite words
and catchphrase are:

320
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,093
"I'm so happy
that words fail me".

321
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,197
This is On-Location Tsubaki.

322
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,699
Luffy, you set out
to sea alone, right?

323
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,601
Please, tell us how
a complete simpleton

324
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,504
such as yourself was
able to survive on his own.

325
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,307
Uh, okay! Before I set sail,
I packed up lots of meat

326
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,509
and water that
I got in the village.

327
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,078
But I ate them
right after I left.

328
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,314
I'm so dumbfounded,
words fail me.

329
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,683
So after that,
I was starving and thirsty.

330
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:44,118
It was a really rough time.

331
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:46,053
I managed to stay alive
by eating mushrooms

332
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:48,588
and other stuff some
goof left on the boat.

333
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:49,856
No one left mushrooms!

334
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,692
They grew there
because of the humidity!

335
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,661
Every once in a while,
a giant fish would jump

336
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,329
out of the sea
and try to eat me!

337
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,064
And I was always
glad when they did!

338
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:59,166
I'd beat 'em up
and eat 'em whole!

339
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,734
Ate them? You could've died!

340
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,804
It sounds to me like you
were just absurdly lucky.

341
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:06,540
But I knew I'd be okay!
'Cause I believe in myself!

342
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:09,476
Whoa! That's so powerful,
words fail me.

343
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,478
And it wasn't long after that

344
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,180
that the intellectually
challenged Zoro

345
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,515
joined your crew.

346
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,550
I bet your answers
won't be much better.

347
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,152
You two idiots were
made for each other.

348
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:19,720
How've you been
able to stay alive?

349
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:21,822
I set out to sea way
before Luffy did,

350
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:23,657
so I was more
experienced than he was.

351
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,393
I'd already gotten
used to it, more or less.

352
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,630
Since he's a complete moron,
our survival was up to me.

353
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:33,267
Every once in a while, a giant
fish would jump out of the sea

354
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,569
and try to eat us, and I was
always glad when they did.

355
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:36,269
I'd beat 'em up
and eat 'em whole.

356
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:37,504
As much as I wanted to be wrong,

357
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,173
I knew you were
going to say that.

358
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,240
In other words,

359
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:41,308
you two could have starved
to death at any time,

360
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:44,178
putting an abrupt end
to all of your adventures.

361
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:46,280
Maybe so. But it takes
a real man to die

362
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,682
and then come back from
the dead without dying.

363
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:51,752
Whoa! That's so stupidly
manly, words fail me.

364
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:55,556
Right! That's when
Nami entered the picture!

365
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,691
Yep! One of the first things
I noticed about them

366
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:00,694
was their surprising lack of
planning or sense of danger.

367
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,830
Which is exactly why, once
I joined their crew,

368
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:05,366
I put myself in charge
of food management.

369
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:06,800
It was a challenge.

370
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:07,801
I had to think of ways

371
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,170
to preserve our cheese,
bread, meat, and water.

372
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:13,274
If it wasn't for me, I'm sure
those two would be dead by now.

373
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:17,278
So, in other words.
They owe me their lives.

374
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:21,081
Whoa! That smile is
so scheming, words fail me.

375
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,417
Which brings us to
the lying coward Usopp:

376
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,785
next to join the gang.

377
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:27,788
With him came the Going Merry,
a fine ship you buffoons

378
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:29,790
somehow managed
to leave the village with.

379
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:33,160
That's right. And they've always
been grateful to me for it.

380
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:35,195
You weren't the one
who gave it to us, jackass.

381
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:36,363
Yeah, it was Kaya.

382
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,766
Only because I was
good friends with Kaya!

383
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,301
Less fighting, more talking.

384
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,403
At this point, did something
change in your lives?

385
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:44,171
Uh-huh! Usopp's
a great fisherman,

386
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:46,340
so we caught fish
instead of beating them up!

387
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,742
But they were dinky fish,
like sardines and stuff.

388
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:49,743
Not much of a meal.

389
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,112
You jerk! I think
seasonal fish taste better

390
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,048
than those sea monsters
you were eating!

391
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:55,182
The Merry happened
to have a galley,

392
00:21:55,216 --> 00:21:57,751
so that was the time I started
cooking for you guys.

393
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,520
And Usopp had a lot
of good seasonings

394
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:00,688
for some strange reason.

395
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,590
Truth be told,
Nami's cooking was great!

396
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:04,491
It just wasn't free,
which is kinda lame.

397
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:05,793
We told her to never cook again!

398
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,561
A girl's gotta make
a living, you know!

399
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:11,231
Devils come in all shapes
and sizes, don't they?

400
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:16,670
Finally, we have the chef who
keeps his kitchen oh-so clean

401
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:18,471
and his thoughts oh-so dirty!

402
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,243
To be honest, I only
wanna cook for Nami!

403
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:23,444
The others can suck it!

404
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:26,146
Since Sanji joined the crew,
meals aren't just something

405
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,215
we have to have to stay alive:
we really look forward to them!

406
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:30,484
If we catch any fish
or birds or stuff like that,

407
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,620
he'll turn them all
into really yummy food!

408
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:34,722
And, due to his
culinary expertise,

409
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:36,590
we always get balanced meals!

410
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:38,292
When he took over the cooking,

411
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:40,294
I was able to focus
on being the navigator.

412
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:41,629
That's the only
thing he's good at,

413
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:43,330
so the rest of us
make the best of it.

414
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,465
What? Bastard!

415
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:45,833
Now then, Sanji.

416
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,701
I think the time has
come in this interview

417
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:48,869
to let our viewers know exactly

418
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:52,706
what the food you eat during
your journeys tastes like.

419
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:02,549
Again, words fail me.

420
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,651
You're a terrible reporter!
