[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,250
hidden at the end of this sea?

00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,919
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,588
Is that exciting or what?

00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,091
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>

9
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:22,739
<i>Back when we first started,</i>

10
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:25,909
<i>Sailed toward different dreams</i>

11
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,911
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:32,957
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see</i>

13
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:38,338
<i>And we know that our</i>

<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,602
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past</i>

18
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:54,479
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:59,401
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>We know we'll get there</i>

20

<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:07,200
<i>Every tear that we've cried</i>
<i>only helps our dreams come true</i>

22
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:14,249
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life</i>

23
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:21,756
<i>A glimpse of the sun rising</i>
<i>on our tomorrow!</i>

[NARRATOR] In a dastardly bid
to prevent Luffy and Nami

25
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:34,019
from reaching the ark,
Eneru released his Mamaragan!

26
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:37,897
[WYPER]
It won't work, Eneru.

27
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:43,903
This land won't fall!

28
00:02:43,987 --> 00:02:46,281
[NARRATOR]
Still, Luffy and Nami persisted.

29
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:49,075
[LUFFY] Give back
the Golden Bell! Right now!

30
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,287
[ENERU] Now disappear
along with this land!

Clear the sky!

Now ring it, Straw Hat!
Light the fire of Shandora!

38
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:21,816
[NARRATOR] At last,
Luffy reached the ark and

39
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,570
confronted Eneru,
and the final showdown began.

40
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,531
You're next!

41
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:30,575
I'll ring you along

Saruyama brothers?

I did it!

It was right here!

Unbelievably beautiful.

Ah! That sound is amazing.

62
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:09,591
What is it?

63
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:16,139
It's come.

Now I get it.

00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,649
[PIERRE squawks]

68
00:05:28,902 --> 00:05:32,072
Singing. Listen.

69
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:34,866
The Vearth is singing a song.

70
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:35,950
[SUU]
Ah.

71
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:40,205
[bell rings]

72
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:45,001
This is proof. God is real.

73
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:47,879
[CHIEFTAIN]
This is surely a miracle!

74
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:50,340
I had almost abandoned hope
that we would ever hear

75
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:51,966
the golden bell again

76
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,303
after nearly
400 years of silence.

77
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:58,223
Great Warrior Kalgara.

78
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:01,101
Can you hear it?

79
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:05,855
The unmistakable echo
of the Fire of Shandora!

80
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:10,068
[bell rings]

81
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:12,987
Good heavens.

82
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,615
What must've happened
to this land?

83
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,076
What is that strange chiming?

84
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,577
Could it be?

85
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:21,329
The legendary bell?

86
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,374
[bell rings]

87
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:29,504
[WYPER]
Montblanc Noland.

88
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:32,924
Can you hear the bell sounding
from beyond your grave?

89
00:06:33,008 --> 00:06:35,635
I'm sorry you've been
kept waiting so long.

90
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:37,762
May these chimes
reverberate all the way

91
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:39,222
to your descendants.

92
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:42,142
Now rest in peace, Noland.

[CRICKET]
Yeah! There's no doubt about it.

100
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:28,980
Only one bell in this
world could echo so far!

101
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:30,857
And with such emotion.

102
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:35,904
Awesome!

103
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:37,822
Absolutely!

104
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:41,409
Y'know those giants you see
in the Cumuloregalis Clouds?

105
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:44,412
The story goes a little
something like this.

106
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:46,039
Whenever a human
inhabits the sky

107
00:07:46,122 --> 00:07:48,041
and the sun's rays
shine upon him,

108
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:50,210
his shadow is reflected
on the deep mist,

109
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,587
and then cast far
across the horizon.

110
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,714
To onlookers, the shadow appears

111
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:58,510
as if it's a gigantic
monster looming above.

112
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:00,387
Ya mean those aren't
really giants?

113
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,014
They're actually
somebody's shadow?

114
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:05,600
That would mean we've already
found irrefutable proof

115
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:07,852
that people do live in the sky!

116
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:09,354
Am I right?

117
00:08:09,437 --> 00:08:12,065
Yeah, I once thought the story
was a meaningless fantasy

118
00:08:12,148 --> 00:08:14,651
and dismissed it altogether.

119
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:18,029
But it seems there is
truth to this legend.

121
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:21,574

of the golden bell.

[CRICKET]
If a golden bell exists,

124
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:31,459
then why not
an entire city?

125
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:34,045
Noland was telling the truth!

126
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:36,673
His reputation can
finally be redeemed!

127
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:40,468
And with it, our family name!

128
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:43,346
That's the reason you
rang the bell, isn't it, kid?

end of the battle.

[CHOPPER] No! You have
to be treated right away!

180
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:21,624
My wounds aren't that severe.

181
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,753
Really. That guy.

182
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,755
He needs help more than me.

183
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:28,214
Look after him.

184
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:39,726
[CHOPPER]
It's true!

185
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:42,187
His body's worn out. He's dying!

186
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,439
Yeah, but he was
tryin' to kill us.

187
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:46,524
We don't owe him anything.

188
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:47,525
[ZORO]
I know.

189
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,402
It doesn't make
much sense, but...

190
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:52,697
He was going all out,
just like the rest of us.

191
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:56,743
Uh... He's a hero? Seriously?

192
00:13:56,826 --> 00:13:58,328
[ZORO sighs]
Who knows.

193
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:01,581
[AISA]
Um...

194
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:03,500
Help him, Raccoon-Doggy?

195
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,294
[CHOPPER]
I'm a reindeer! Antlers! See?

196
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,504
[sighs]

197
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:10,674
Don't worry. He'll survive.

198
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:12,175
[AISA]
Thanks, reindeer!

199
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,973
[GAN FALL] Pierre, you're
going to over-exert yourself.

200
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:20,642
Go rest with the
Blue Sea people.

201
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:22,102
[PIERRE squawks]

202
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:26,481
[GAN FALL]
Very well, then.

203
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:29,359
I want you to go and
gather the families.

204
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:32,112
[PIERRE squawks]

205
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:34,406
[SANJI]
I guess anything's possible.

206
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:36,491
Speaking of which,
what do you think happened

207
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:38,284
to Eneru and the bell?

208
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:40,495
Don't know I guess
they must've crashed.

209
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:43,957
So we have a city of gold.

210
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,042
But in name only.

211
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:50,046
Which just means that our
adventure in poverty continues.

212
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,632
I'd rather have dials
over gold any day.

213
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:55,802
That's something we just
can't get from the Blue Sea.

214
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:57,429
[SANJI] I'm to the point
where I'd settle for some

215
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:59,097
concrete news.

216
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,807
I hope Nami's all right.

217
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,517
And where's Conis?

218
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,979
This not knowing
is driving me crazy!

219
00:15:06,062 --> 00:15:08,064
[BRAHAM] Do you think it's
a good idea to leave Wyper

220
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:09,733
with the Blue Sea dwellers?

221
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:11,317
[LAKI]
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

222
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:13,653
It appears Aisa
has befriended them.

223
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:15,363
We'll just have to act quickly.

224
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,615
If our enemy wakes before
we leave, we're finished.

225
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,451
Gather those who can
move and we'll banish

226
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:22,120
every last one of Eneru's
priests to the clouds.

227
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:23,621
[GROUP]
Yeah!

228
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:27,250
So did you have a
chance to patch him up?

229
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:29,836
[CHOPPER]
Yes. All he needs now is rest.

230
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,463
[LUFFY]
Hey!

231
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:40,055
[GROUP laughing]

232
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:42,057
[SANJI]
Nami!

233
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,059
Conis!

234
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:45,643
[USOPP]
Luffy!

235
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:53,318
We're back!
I'm so glad you're okay!

236
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:58,198
[CONIS] I was afraid I wouldn't
see any of you again!

237
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:00,700
[SANJI]
She was worried! Ah!

238
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:01,785
Oh, please.

239
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:03,536
I'm glad you guys
grabbed some food.

240
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,080
Where's it from?

241
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,290
[NAMI] We found the priests'
storage locker on our way back

242
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:08,500
through the forest.

243
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,959
There were lots more!

244
00:16:10,043 --> 00:16:12,796
But uh, how did you manage
to find your way back down?

245
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,506
[LUFFY]
My Gum-Gum Balloon.

246
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:15,548
[USOPP]
Oh.

247
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:19,135
[ZORO]
Conis, where's your old man?

248
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:21,304
He, um... Well, he...

249
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:22,806
He protected me.

250
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:39,197
And then Eneru...

251
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:43,660
Don't tell me...

252
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:49,416
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,543
Yeah, me too.

254
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:53,044
Me three.

255
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:57,340
You're supposed to be dead!

256
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:58,883
[PAGAYA]
Sorry, I'm alive!

257
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:01,886
[CONIS]
Father!

258
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:06,224
[NAMI] You were on the lower
level of the White Sea?

259
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:08,018
I found myself there
after being blasted

260
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:09,686
from the ledge.

261
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,354
And I wasn't alone.

262
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,606
Countless others ended
up in the same spot

263
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,317
while making their way
towards Cloud End.

264
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:19,654
Yet, as we speak, they too
are now on the journey back

265
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,032
via the restored Milky Roads.

266
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:24,868
Of course, given that there's
no longer an Angel Island,

267
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:27,078
a new destination was chosen.

268
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:28,496
Upper Yard.

269
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:37,964
[GROUP laughing]

270
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:41,718
Thank you so much.

271
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:43,386
[HUSBAND]
We owe you our lives, god.

272
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,763
Just Gan Fall.

273
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:47,682
I no longer go by that title.

274
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,060
You were all forced to work
in a place like this

275
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:52,062
for six long years.

276
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:53,229
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:56,274
We lost Angel Island,

278
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:58,526
the home we were
supposed to return to.

279
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:03,031
And like the Shandorians,
our birthright's now lost.

280
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:04,866
Is the battle really over?

281
00:18:12,707 --> 00:18:14,834
God's army has gone,
but I just don't...

282
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:16,002
My Chief.

283
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:17,879
Do you really believe
the 400-year rift

284
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:19,631
can be mended so easily?

285
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:23,093
[USOPP]
Ah!

286
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:25,261
Boy. I stuffed myself!

287
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:26,763
Well, it's getting
pretty late you guys.

288
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:28,473
It's time to hit the ship.

289
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:30,809
Whoa, you're not talkin'
about leaving, are you?

290
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,060
Relax.

291
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:34,187
All I meant was it'd be
a nice change of pace

292
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,648
to go back to the ship
and sleep in a warm bed!

293
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:38,858
Usopp, can you believe
what she just said?

294
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:40,568
Hardly. It's sick.

295
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,487
I mean, the thought doesn't
even cross her mind

296
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,905
to go out and look for gold.

297
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:45,490
And she calls herself a pirate!

298
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:47,200
You can't be serious!

299
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:52,914
[NAMI]
How'd you two like fat lips

300
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:54,582
to go with your fat bellies?

301
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:02,549
It's time.

302
00:19:02,632 --> 00:19:05,802
And soon... I will return!

303
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:09,389
To the wide-open sky:
the perfect home for a god!

304
00:19:09,472 --> 00:19:11,349
Pristine and unobstructed.

305
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,644
Yes, and best of all,

306
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:16,980
no pests to get in my way!

307
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:19,190
[laughing]

308
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:21,484
I'll be sure no one
gets near it.

309
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:24,696
My own private paradise.

310
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,824
A land boundless, exquisite.

311
00:19:27,907 --> 00:19:30,076
It's just like a dream...

312
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,745
...which comes to life!

00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:36,499
Maxim.

314
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,586
Set sail and deliver me to
my new floating kingdom,

315
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:42,172
which shines brightly
in the night.

316
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:44,007
The land without end.

317
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,842
The Endless Vearth!

318
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:53,683
Where am I?

319
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:56,061
[GAN FALL]
Inside the ruins of Shandora.

320
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,939
[WYPER]
Gan Fall!

321
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:01,649
You shouldn't move yet.

322
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,235
[WYPER]
You! You're a Skypiean!

323
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,572
[CHIEFTAIN]
Rest.

324
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:08,948
[WYPER]
Chief!

325
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:10,950
Please explain. Why are we here?

326
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:13,703
Have we both been
captured by the Skypieans?

327
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:17,082
We are all bound together.

328
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:19,668
Made brothers by the war.

[WYPER]
The golden belfry.

330
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:23,963
It's the Shandorians' sacred
duty to protect it to the end!

331
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:27,467
[drumbeat]

332
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,718
Listen.

333
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:31,554
That's the sound of war
drums announcing battle!

334
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:33,765
There's the signal fire, too!

335
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:35,266
[CHIEFTAIN]
Patience, Wyper.

336
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,810
Rest awhile longer.

337
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:39,562
The heroism of our
ancestors is clear.

338
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:42,148
But whatever violence
happened in the past,

339
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:45,402
you must allow it to stay there.

340
00:20:45,485 --> 00:20:47,320
Our future starts here.

341
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:49,656
This is our home now,
and we Shandorians

342
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:51,408
will make it a good one.

343
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:54,244
I know.
But looking out there, I...

344
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:55,620
[GAN FALL]
Yes.

345
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:59,165
Most often, the call for
vengeance cannot be ignored.

346
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:02,419
But today, it has been
drowned out by a sea

347
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:05,088
of voices screaming
in celebration.

348
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:07,173

We did it!

00:21:59,225 --> 00:22:01,436
Yes! Yes! Yes!

356
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:31,758
<i>When you're lost and alone,</i>
<i>I can always hear your voice</i>

357
00:22:31,841 --> 00:22:36,930
<i>While you wander far from home,</i>
<i>gazing up at the sky</i>

358
00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:39,683
<i>You are just like the moon</i>

359
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:44,479
<i>You never change as</i>
<i>you climb into the night</i>

360
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:52,946
<i>But your reflection wanes,</i>
<i>then you disappear,</i>

361
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:56,950
<i>fading so suddenly...</i>

362
00:22:57,033 --> 00:23:02,205
<i>Stay as you are,</i>
<i>don't lose your way</i>

363
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:11,131
<i>Let these words guide you,</i>
<i>don't ever look back!</i>

364
00:23:11,214 --> 00:23:15,552
<i>Don't give up on your dreams,</i>
<i>through endless nights</i>

365
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:17,345
<i>they come to you</i>

366
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:22,809
<i>Again and again, until you</i>
<i>see them shining through!</i>

367
00:23:22,892 --> 00:23:28,690
<i>You may not return,</i>
<i>I hope that you'll learn</i>

368
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:35,405
<i>to put your past behind,</i>
<i>and just keep moving on</i>

369
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:44,956
[ROBIN] "We shall know the true
meaning and utter it to no one."

370
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,459
[CHIEFTAIN]
Where did you learn those words?

371
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:49,169
[ROBIN]
They're engraved on the belfry.

372
00:23:49,252 --> 00:23:51,421
And more about the ancient
weapon "Poseidon"?

373
00:23:51,504 --> 00:23:53,214
Why was Gold D. Roger...

374
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,299
Wait!

375
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:55,800
Could the Rio
Poneglyph actually be--?

376
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:57,719
[LUFFY]
Enough talk! We're pirates.

377
00:23:57,802 --> 00:23:59,721
Now, let's snatch
the gold and run!

378
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:01,389
On the next One Piece!

379
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,726
"I Made it Here! The Yarn
the Poneglyphs Spin!"

380
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:07,228
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
