00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,030
[NAMI sighs]

174
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,932
[NAMI]
They finally came off.

175
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,468
Calling it a powerful
one‐shot attack?

176
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:05,871
Think that's a bit of
an understatement.

177
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,106
The fighting's come far.

178
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,942
They're right there,
just around the corner.

179
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,215
[NAMI]
Guess the situation's changed.

180
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,718
Anyway, I better
get to the palace.

181
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,458
[ZORO] Sounds like
the battle's started.

182
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,394
What about Vivi?

183
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,629
[SANJI]
Oh, yeah.

184
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,898
One more thing, and this is an
important fact to remember.

185
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,736
After a battle, these guys
put down a ton of food.

186
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,170
'Kay.

187
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,373
We'll be waiting for you!

188
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:44,076
[LUFFY]
Yeah!

189
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,145
[SANJI]
This is absolutely crucial.

190
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,813
[DUCK A squawks]

191
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,748
[DUCK B squawks]

192
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,416
[ZORO]
Don't screw this up!

193
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,186
[SANJI]
Let's go! See you at the palace!

194
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,370
Chaka!

195
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,842
[CROCODILE chuckles]

196
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,911
Weakness is a crime...

197
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,213
...punishable by death.

198
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,853
[KOZA]
Vivi!

199
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,121
No. Koza.

200
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,456
[CROCODILE]
Huh?

201
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,228
It's you.

202
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:13,332
I see you came through the
shortcut you used to use.

203
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,435
This can't be.
What am I seeing here?

204
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,081
[KOZA] I came in hope of
persuading the royal army,

205
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,316
but...

206
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,520
[KOZA]
Chaka...

207
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,856
And the king is...

208
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,092
He's about to be killed
by this country's hero.

209
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,194
I can't believe my eyes.

210
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,030
[laughing]

211
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,433
Now things are starting
to get interesting!

212
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,468
Here we are in the
midst of an epic war,

213
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,271
and yet, the leaders of both
sides aren't on the battlefield.

214
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,940
Fate has placed them
squabbling at my feet!

215
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,443
A battle to the death
between two broken titans

216
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,379
bleeding out the last
remnants of their power!

217
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,483
You seem lost and confused.

218
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:10,022
Don't worry. It's a natural
reaction. Let me help you.

219
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,557
Relax and open your mind.

220
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,327
Then imagine being faced with
the worst possible scenario.

221
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:23,068
[TOTO] Koza, purge your
heart of all suspicion.

222
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,077
Do you love this country?

223
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,321
This is my home!

224
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,089
[COBRA]
Mine as well!

225
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,862
Koza, listen!

226
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,063
[KOZA]
Vivi!

227
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,566
Who is responsible for the
drought ravaging this country?

228
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,035
Tell me!

229
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,403
It was‐‐!

230
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,172
[CROCODILE]
That honor belongs to me.

231
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,540
Over the past two years,

232
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,009
each and every malicious
deed you attributed

233
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,246
to the king's doing was in fact
perpetrated by my company.

234
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,282
A trap that saw you playing
right into our hands.

235
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:14,420
It was a flawless,
systematic plot of deception.

236
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,889
I must say, it was entertaining

237
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,625
watching as the royal family
and its mighty army

238
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,194
desperately chased our shadows.

239
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:26,265
[CROCODILE laughs]

240
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,266
[CROCODILE]
Pity.

241
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,368
You probably would've
died in ignorant bliss

242
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,437
not knowing these brutal facts.

243
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,306
[CROCODILE laughs]

244
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:41,247
Koza! Listen!

245
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,548
Majesty!

246
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,384
There's still some time
if you have the courage!

247
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:49,622
You must act now. Save as
many citizens as you can.

248
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,057
[CHAKA]
In less than half an hour,

249
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,427
the whole Palace Square will
be blown to kingdom come!

250
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,162
What do ya mean?!

251
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,999
So, you're still alive, are you?

252
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:08,073
Hurry!

253
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,914
[CROCODILE]
Hm?

254
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,451
[VIVI]
Stop!

255
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,455
[gasps] Vivi!

256
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,256
Get off of me!

257
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,091
What're you doing?
There's no time!

258
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,927
The battle is about to
spill into the Square!

259
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,363
If it's really set to
blow up, get off!

260
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,599
You have to listen to me!

261
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,103
[VIVI]
Think this through. Please.

262
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,605
What will happen if
you tell the armies

263
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,440
the Square is set to explode?

264
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,975
The men will panic.

265
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,977
It would only add more
chaos to the battle.

266
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,547
And even if you stop the bomb,
it won't stop the fighting!

267
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,051
Either way, people are
still going to die!

268
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,286
You won't save anyone!

269
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,625
Understand?

270
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:03,529
[chuckles] Well, well,
what a perceptive girl.

271
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,397
Our only hope is to do
what should've been done

272
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,232
from the start.

273
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:13,572
We have to stop the rebellion
and end this bloodshed!

I was going to sit back

278
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,074
and watch passively while
you tried to ruin my plans?

is breath left in my body.

you?! I'm a child!

You're a pain in the neck, kid.

That's absurd!
