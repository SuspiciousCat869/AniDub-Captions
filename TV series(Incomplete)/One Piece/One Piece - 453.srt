00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,491
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,327
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,062
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,932
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,400
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,236
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,971
after eating the
Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,141
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,111
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,512
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,114
of the World Government,

12
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:05,585
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,987
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,057
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,127
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue.

16
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,166
The crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,104
[NARRATOR]
Separated from his crew,

18
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,208
Luffy and his newfound cohorts
have hijacked a Navy ship

19
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,143
in order to rescue
his brother, Ace,

20
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,980
who's been transported
to Navy HQ for execution.

21
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,349
[BUGGY] Screw you!
Nobody is that crazy!

22
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,284
Surely you guys heard
about the war brewing

23
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,752
between Whitebeard and the Navy!

24
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,987
Uh. War?

25
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,255
Navy Headquarters?

26
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,358
Well, we passed through the Gate
of Justice. Isn't that right?

27
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,095
Our destination is
Enies Lobby or Navy HQ.

28
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,398
This Tub Current is restricted
to Government passage only.

29
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,300
It's one giant whirlpool
that connects

30
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,002
the Government's
three major facilities.

31
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,737
[PRISONERS]
No one told us about this!

32
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,772
Buggy! Buggy!

33
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,610
That's enough!
Don't get too flashy!

34
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,746
You guys are high on power
and acting impulsively.

35
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:10,650
So listen. I want all of you
to live out a dream with me.

36
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:14,520
For today... I'll
conquer Whitebeard,

37
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,156
and thus, rule the world!

38
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:23,029
[PRISONER GG] I'll follow
you anywhere, Captain Buggy!

39
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,466
[PRISONER HH] To hell
with living a peaceful life!

40
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,234
[BUGGY]
All right then!

41
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:32,605
Now let's win this war,
you guys! To Navy HQ!

42
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,806
[PRISONERS cheer]

43
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,376
So, I guess the mutiny's over?

44
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,346
Let them have fun
while they can.

45
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,319
[LUFFY]
"The Friends' Whereabouts!

46

The Weatheria Report
and the Cyborg Animals!"

47
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,143
[LUFFY]
Huh?

48
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,256
I know you're worried about Ace,
but standing vigil won't help.

49
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,693
You should rest and prepare
yourself for the battle.

50
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,470
[JIMBEI] The war that approaches
us will be a trying one,

51
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:15,141
and one that changes
the tide of the times.

52
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,211
Having just escaped from the
greatest prison in the world,

53
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,412
we may take heart.

54
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:23,616
But the fortress that lies
before us is ever more imposing.

55
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,279
[NARRATOR]
Far away, but not long ago,

56
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,581
on a Sky Island
known as Weatheria.

57
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:59,218
A weather wizard, or
rather a weather scientist,

58
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,380
continued his studies.

59
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,067
Hey, hey, hey, young lady!

60
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,068
Hey, hey.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, young lady!

Hey! Hey!

63
00:07:41,077 --> 00:07:44,480
Yes, hey!
What do you want now?!

64
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:47,683
Ah! My face! What is this thing?

65
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,419
Why, it's my famous
cloud candy of course!

66
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:52,488
Well, I suppose
it's not famous yet.

67
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:54,423
It's taken many
hours of research

68
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:56,626
to get it tasting like
cotton candy, you know.

69
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:59,362
But I think it's all
been worth it, don't you?

70
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,032
[NAMI shouting]

71
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:03,766

00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:06,269
Are you nuts?!

73
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:10,473
Violence won't do, young lady!
Let's just calm down!

74
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:13,342
I could've died!

75
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:18,047
Oh, wow. That does
taste like cotton candy!

76
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,217
Yeah! Weren't you listening?

77
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,254
Wow. Really is an island
of wonders, huh?

78
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,025
[sighs]

79
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:33,429
Hey. I'm just checking,
but are you positive

80
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:36,032
we're still heading to
the Sabaody Archipelago?

81
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:37,033
[HAREDAS]
Of course.

82
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:40,336
I said I would grant you
a favor, and I meant it!

83
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:43,673
'Kay, but it was quite a long
time ago when you told me that.

84
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:47,476
Not to be rude, but
when will we get there?

85
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,613
Uh? What do you mean?

86
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:54,050
Hm? Ah! When do we get there?!

87
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,486
Impossible to say since
Weatheria travels on the winds.

88
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,523
So, if a typhoon hits,
we'll get there pretty fast.

89
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:02,725
Then how far did
we get yesterday?

90
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:05,127
My guess is about
600 feet or so.

91
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:08,231
--[NAMI grunts]
--[HAREDAS laughs]

92

[HAREDAS groans]

93
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:12,301
[NAMI] Seriously,
if this stupid island

94
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:15,104
wasn't floating in the sky,
I would've bailed already!

95
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,406
That's silly.
Even if we were on land,

96
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,842
you'd still be too far away
for it to do any good.

97
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,545
If you stay here, you'll get
there someday at least.

98
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:25,281
I know, but I'm not going
there for a vacation.

99
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,216
This is urgent business, okay?

100
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:31,153
We could go down for a bit.

101
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:33,155
Frankly, I could stand
to stock up on some

102
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:34,757
funding for my research.

103
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,328
Huh? Go down where?

104
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:40,496
On the ground.

105
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:44,100
[NAMI]
Uh... You can do that?

106
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:51,440
[HAREDAS] My research is
actually quite costly.

107
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:54,143
Thankfully, my weather
expertise is valuable

108
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:58,347
to the land dwellers, so I can
turn a profit pretty handily.

109
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:01,617
Wha.... is this?

Over here!

A ship?

114
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:32,581
[NAMI]
Whoa. What the heck? It flies?

115
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:38,454
[yelps] Uh, no! No!

116
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:46,362
Here we go!

117
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,665
[NAMI]
Huh? [screams]

118
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:05,247
That's the island I was
looking for, let's land there!

119
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:14,490
[NAMI]
It's so dry.

120

Wow, that's rough.

121

And we're to believe that?

[HAREDAS]
Why not?

123
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:28,838
Your problem is straightforward
enough, I think.

124
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:32,274
Just a bit of rain should
set things right in no time!

125
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,777
Thankfully, I'm an
expert with the weather.

126

I'll gladly summon
a shower or two!

So, how about we make
a little deal?

Does a hundred million
berries sound fair?

a hundred sound?

[HAREDAS laughs]
It's fine.

140
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:19,255
That aside, can you
really do this?

141
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:21,657
Aren't you being
a bit optimistic?

142
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,995
Just watch and believe,
my dear lady. This'll be easy.

143
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:38,674
What's that?
Soap bubbles, maybe?

144
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:40,776
Looks like there's
something inside.

145

[HAREDAS laughs]
One more thing.

146

Could you take this and generate
some wind for me, please?

147
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:52,922
Oh, I see... Do you
want it full power?

148
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:54,790

But of course!

Hm...

160
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:24,947
Well, I suppose this
is goodbye, young lady.

161
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,683
I already spoke with the
mayor about your journey.

162
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:30,386
He said he would be happy
to help you along the way.

163
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:31,487
[NAMI]
I'm not going.

164
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,655
Huh? Why not?

165
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:34,490
It's obvious, isn't it?

166
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:37,159
Because, I want to learn
this science of yours!

167
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:38,761
I'm pretty impressed!

168
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,862
Really?

169
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:41,864
Since it's still
a while to Sabaody,

170
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:45,134
would you mind teaching
me along the way?

00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:50,105
Oh, great! I can't wait!

173
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,007
Anyone with a passion
for the weather

174
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,776
is welcome to learn from me!

175
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,744
[BOTH laugh]

176
00:14:57,613 --> 00:15:00,816
There's still one left.
Perfect. Now look.

177
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:02,785
This here is what
we in the business

178
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,387
call a soap bubble thundercloud.

179
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,759
[HAREDAS]
Oh, that's not good at all.

180
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:18,400
[groaning]

181
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:23,439
[NAMI growls] You old fool.
What are you doing?!

182
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:26,742
[HAREDAS] Science exacts a
price on its learner, my dear!

183
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:28,677
[NAMI] I'll exact
a price out of you!

184
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:31,555
[HAREDAS]
Help! Assault!

185
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,017
[NARRATOR] This is
the Mechanical Island,

186
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,719
Future Land Baldimore,

187
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:57,022
also known as the
birthplace of the Genius.

188
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,610
Super relaxed.

189
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,647
[KITTON sighs]
Aw, man!

190
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,884
He was so much fun before
and now he's just lame.

191
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,953
Grampa, tell me
you have a plan!

192
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,022
We've gotta turn
Franky back somehow!

193
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,957
[TAROIMO whines]

194
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,693
I ordered some cola for him
but it hasn't arrived yet.

195
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,929
I'm afraid he's beyond
our help, without it.

196
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,031
I'm sure a bottle or two
will bring him back

197
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,033
to his perverted
old, uh, I mean,

198
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,870
charming old self, but we
can't make him go wild.

199
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,972
Or can we?

200
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,945
[TAROIMO howls]

201
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:13,999

[FRANKY]
It's cold!

203
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,538
How on earth I did I end up
out here in the elements?

204
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:25,577
Ah! How lovely, a scarf
for me? Thanks.

205
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,920
[FRANKY]
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my!

206
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,088
Goodness!

207
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,857
This... This is the nightmare!

208
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,828
[FRANKY]
"Keep Out,

209
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:48,567
this is an enclosed forest
of mechanical animals."

Awakening in the Jungle!

[TAROIMO pants]

214
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,106
[KITTON] Nothing's more
wild than mecha animals!

215
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,708
This'll get him back on
track for sure! [laughs]

216
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,010
[NARRATOR]
Don't try this at home, kids.

217
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,180
Now, now, let's all calm
down, shall we friends?

218
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,349
Because you seem
agitated this morning.

219
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,384
Did you remember to
eat your breakfast?

220
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,854
It is the most important
meal of the day, you know.

221
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,189
Let's work on getting those
blood sugar levels up!

222
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,624
[CYBORG ANIMALS growl]

223
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,826
Huh? Hold on a second,

224
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,962
that means it's breakfast
time for me, too!

225
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,665
Ahhh, you silly
goose! Ha, ha, ha.

226
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,939
Delicious! No better way
to start the day than with

227
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,242
a cup of tea! Ha!

228
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,612
Would you care for
some tea, too?

229
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,820
Ah! Let's cherish
every moment, friends!

230
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,656
[KITTON]
Ah... It's not working!

231
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,059

234
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,686
Someone help us!

235
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,930
Ah, my friends, good day!

236
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:58,931
It's Franky!

237
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,032
[TAROIMO barks]

238
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:04,770
That's not proper. How about
"Mr. Frank" from now on?

239
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,473
Violence is never the a--!

240

[FRANKY groans]

241
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,746
I know that you're at an age
when you want to be naughty.

242
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:20,085
But listen... we can...
sort this out...

243
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,421
like gentlemen, right?

244
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:27,226
Nothing-- good-- ever
comes-- from violence!

245
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,928
Come on, just fight
back! Please!

246
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,197
You can't reason with gorillas!

247
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,966
Rela--

248
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,467
Listen to--

249
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,202
Listen to what I
to what I have to--

250
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:43,175
If you'd let me talk-- I
have-- wisdom to impart!

251
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:49,848
My friend-- we must-- not--

252
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,851

254
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,823
[BOTH]
Huh?!

00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,097
[CYBORG ANIMALS growl]

256
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,470

[FRANKY]
Ohh, yeah! Super!

258
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:23,749
[FRANKY yells]

259
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,120
Who do you think I am,
you punks, chopped liver?

260
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,956
You can't step to Franky!

261
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:34,359
He's back! You were seriously
starting to scare me!

262
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,929
[FRANKY]
Oh yeah, wow!

263
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,466
[KITTON]
What's wrong?

264
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,270
[FRANKY] I cooled off a bit and
ran out of steam, literally.

265
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,441
Huh? You mean... you're
gonna turn back?

266
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,978
Oh, I know just
the place to go!

267
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:53,812
[FRANKY]
Huh?

268
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,416
[FRANKY]
Where are you takin' me, kid?

269
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:01,119
[KITTON] To the house of Dr.
Vegapunk! It's not far and I bet

270
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,088
we can find a machine
that makes cola there!

271
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,090
[FRANKY]
Say what now?

272
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,492
[KITTON] Baldimore's
famous for its technology

273
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,329
and this guy is the genius that
cooked up a whole ton of it!

274
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,864
Like, all those mechanical
animals you just fought

275
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:17,302
were made by Dr. Vegapunk
ages ago!

276
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,338
I heard he was
kind of an oddball,

277
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,341
and he did leave the island
overrun with dangerous cyborgs,

278
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:25,410
but that doesn't make
him any less of a genius!

279
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,120
My Grandpa told me there's
some dangerous stuff in there.

280
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,322
But it's an emergency and
I have you to protect me,

281
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,124
so it should be okay.

282
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:43,995

283
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,207

after he runs and runs, he finds
himself face to face with

289
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,140
a mysterious queen
and a frilly dress.

290

Meanwhile, Chopper finds himself
face to face with something

291
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,678
soft, round... and huge.
