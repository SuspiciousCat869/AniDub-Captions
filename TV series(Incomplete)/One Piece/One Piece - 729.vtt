WEBVTT

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.448
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.187
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:45.497
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.902
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:51.309
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.979
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.384
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:58.591
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.532
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.632 --> 00:03:04.335
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:08.310
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.518
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:18.664
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:21.737
and targeted the Don Quixote
Family in Dressrosa.

00:03:21.837 --> 00:03:24.777
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:24.877 --> 00:03:27.582
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:29.652
In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:31.523
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:31.623 --> 00:03:33.728
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives,

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:37.367
until at last,
only their leader remained.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.071
As the struggle continues,

00:03:39.172 --> 00:03:42.311
the razer-sharp threads
of Doflamingo's "Birdcage"

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.583
tear across Dressrosa.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.486
Now, the final
countdown begins,

00:03:46.587 --> 00:03:48.456
and Luffy must finish Doflamingo

00:03:48.557 --> 00:03:52.198
before the kingdom and everyone
in it is torn to shreds.

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.435
Your demise is long overdue.

00:03:54.536 --> 00:03:59.378
[pants] There's not
much time left!

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:07.962
Now Billow-White!

00:04:08.964 --> 00:04:09.799
[gasps]

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.717
[LUFFY]
It's over!

00:04:21.088 --> 00:04:23.292
I'll blow you away!

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.136
[DOFLAMINGO]
Damn you!

00:04:28.236 --> 00:04:29.338
[gasps]

00:04:29.438 --> 00:04:32.277
I'm gonna end this for good.

00:04:32.377 --> 00:04:33.881
[gasps]

00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:37.420
With my Gum-Gum...

00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:46.405
...Leo Bazooka!

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.642
[BOTH] The damn Birdcage.
It's still there!

00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:13.961
It's time for Gum-Gum...

00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:28.055
[TOWNSMAN 728Y] Hey, what's
the matter? Are you okay?

00:05:31.563 --> 00:05:36.940
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:19.792
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:06:47.682 --> 00:06:52.123
[LUFFY panting]

00:07:31.603 --> 00:07:34.609
Sorry, but I can't help you.

00:07:45.496 --> 00:07:48.370
Poor guy. I don't think
he can go on!

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.010
If you turn back, you'll die
along with him! Keep running!

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.081
[TOWNSMAN D]
Let the pirates sort it out!

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:46.686
[panting]

00:08:57.675 --> 00:09:00.515
Hang in there, Straw Hat!

00:09:00.615 --> 00:09:02.518
It's almost over now!

00:09:02.619 --> 00:09:05.022
Think you've got
some fight left?

00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:13.106
Do you recognize me?

00:09:13.206 --> 00:09:17.715
It's Gyats! From the
tournament! Remember?

00:09:17.816 --> 00:09:20.988
[panting]

00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:26.800
That mysterious warrior
named Lucy. It was you!

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.436
[LUFFY]
Uh, yeah.

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:30.239
Ha! It's true!

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.080
For one so small,
you've got serious strength!

00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:42.965
Doflamingo's about to strike!

00:09:43.065 --> 00:09:45.270
Quick, what's your next move?

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.142
Is there anything I can do
to help you out?

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.622
Buy me ten minutes.

00:09:55.758 --> 00:09:57.761
Huh? What for?

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:03.205
[LUFFY]
After I use Bounce-Man,

00:10:03.306 --> 00:10:07.548
I have to wait ten minutes
to recharge my Haki.

00:10:07.648 --> 00:10:10.253
Bounce-Man? Okay?

00:10:10.353 --> 00:10:13.326
[LUFFY] I don't know what
Doflamingo's next move is,

00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:15.496
but I'm pretty much
useless right now,

00:10:15.597 --> 00:10:18.069
so I gotta stay away from him.

00:10:18.169 --> 00:10:22.043
Once my Haki comes back,
I'll give him one good punch,

00:10:22.143 --> 00:10:25.116
and that'll be
the end of him. I promise.

00:10:25.216 --> 00:10:26.719
[GYATS gasps]

00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:44.288
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles] What do
you think you're gonna do

00:10:44.388 --> 00:10:46.593
when I get over there,
Straw Hat?

00:10:46.693 --> 00:10:48.663
Bounce me to death?

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.907
[DOFLAMINGO]
Ready or not, here I come!

00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:01.222
Ten minutes.

00:11:01.322 --> 00:11:05.564
If I make that happen,
we're free from this mess?

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:09.204
Tell me! Do you really think,
in ten minutes,

00:11:09.304 --> 00:11:12.745
you can beat Doflamingo
and get rid of the Birdcage?

00:11:27.975 --> 00:11:30.112
Hey! Answer me!

00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:38.195
I know I can!

00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:45.343
All right!

00:11:45.443 --> 00:11:46.479
Ten minutes!

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.584
Can you men work with that?

00:11:48.684 --> 00:11:54.862
[COMPETITORS]
Yeah!

00:11:54.963 --> 00:11:56.398
No sweat!

00:11:56.498 --> 00:11:58.435
It'll go by faster
than the blink of an eye!

00:11:58.536 --> 00:12:00.172
Take it easy, Lucy.

00:12:00.272 --> 00:12:02.678
After you rest up, you can
really sock it to Doflamingo!

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:04.915
Let us handle the rest!

00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:09.559
Those are all the other
competitors from the tournament.

00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:10.862
They're the same people who

00:12:10.962 --> 00:12:12.765
weren't willing to
help you before!

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.434
Forgive us, Lucy!

00:12:14.535 --> 00:12:15.972
We shouldn't have
gotten so distracted

00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:18.276
by the bounty on your head!

00:12:18.376 --> 00:12:20.246
Yeah, we didn't know
you'd give Doflamingo

00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:22.885
a run for his money!
We're sorry!

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:24.488
As an apology,

00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:27.427
we'll put our lives on
the line to help you out!

00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:30.534
Sorry if we beat him
before you get a chance!

00:12:43.727 --> 00:12:45.062
Hm?

00:13:01.796 --> 00:13:03.867
Guess we can finally give you
a proper thank-you,

00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:05.704
Mr. Heavenly Demon.

00:13:05.804 --> 00:13:09.110
We've got a lot to say, so this
could take a little while.

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:14.889
[COMPETITORS chuckling]

00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:18.362
[MEADOWS chuckles]

00:13:18.462 --> 00:13:20.399
[LOGAN chuckles]

00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:25.677
[COMPETITOR F]
He's lookin' for a fight, huh?

00:13:25.777 --> 00:13:26.713
[COMPETITOR G]
Let's get him!

00:13:26.813 --> 00:13:28.684
[COMPETITORS cheer]

00:13:28.784 --> 00:13:30.353
All right! Now's our chance!

00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:32.992
The other half of you,
follow my lead!

00:13:33.092 --> 00:13:34.394
[COMPETITORS]
Right!

00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:38.971
Remember, men! Keep him safe!

00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:41.075
Just ten minutes!

00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:43.881
After that, we'll be
as good as free!

00:13:43.981 --> 00:13:45.851
[COMPETITORS]
Yeah!

00:13:50.427 --> 00:13:51.362
Look out.

00:13:51.462 --> 00:13:52.296
[GYATS]
Hm?

00:13:55.469 --> 00:13:56.338
[GYATS gasps]

00:13:56.438 --> 00:13:58.409
[BURGESS cackles]

00:14:00.146 --> 00:14:03.586
Too bad! I've got ya!

00:14:03.686 --> 00:14:06.559
What? Not this guy again!

00:14:28.436 --> 00:14:31.876
Heh! Hey, Sabo!

00:14:58.563 --> 00:14:59.665
[SABO]
Luffy!

00:15:02.404 --> 00:15:04.140
[SABO]
His Haki is weak.

00:15:13.493 --> 00:15:16.600
[cackles]

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.503
Too bad, I've got ya!

00:15:47.862 --> 00:15:49.364
[COMPETITOR H]
Hey, isn't that?

00:15:49.464 --> 00:15:51.434
[COMPETITOR I] Yeah,
he's one of the Three-Stars!

00:15:51.536 --> 00:15:52.871
Who is he?

00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:55.911
[COMPETITOR Q] The Revolutionary
Army's Chief of Staff!

00:15:56.011 --> 00:15:57.080
Just in time.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.217
Yeah, I'm everything you say,

00:15:59.317 --> 00:16:01.556
and I came here to
save my brother Luffy.

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:02.724
Huh?

00:16:04.963 --> 00:16:08.002
[SABO] Now, what is it you
want with him, Burgess?

00:16:08.102 --> 00:16:11.041
He's your brother?
That's interesting.

00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:15.182
[BURGESS]
Wonder why that rings a bell.

00:16:24.735 --> 00:16:27.373
[COMPETITORS scream]

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.381
[SABO] I'm sure Fire Fist
Ace said it, too.

00:16:31.481 --> 00:16:33.520
He's our brother as well.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.524
Huh?

00:16:35.624 --> 00:16:37.661
Eh?!

00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:41.068
Oh, really? Fire Fist Ace.

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:43.071
I get the picture now.

00:16:47.447 --> 00:16:50.019
[SABO] After the battle
on Banaro Island,

00:16:50.119 --> 00:16:52.692
you Blackbeard Pirates
took Ace captive,

00:16:52.792 --> 00:16:54.427
and that ended up
being the catalyst

00:16:54.528 --> 00:16:57.133
for that terrible battle
in Marineford.

00:16:58.068 --> 00:17:01.308
Darkness take you!

00:17:02.545 --> 00:17:04.582
[ACE]
Flame Emperor!

00:17:04.682 --> 00:17:08.857
[TEACH cackles]
The sun against darkness, huh?

00:17:08.957 --> 00:17:10.760
Only one can win!

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:14.868
I'll make Whitebeard
the King or die trying.

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:19.043
[yelling]

00:17:19.144 --> 00:17:24.487
[yelling]

00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:34.374
[SABO]
Ace made his own choice,

00:17:34.474 --> 00:17:37.380
so I won't blame you
for what happened.

00:17:38.415 --> 00:17:41.188
But I'll be watching Luffy's
back from here on out.

00:17:41.288 --> 00:17:43.325
Don't forget that!

00:17:55.884 --> 00:17:59.324
[cackles] Do you think I care

00:17:59.424 --> 00:18:01.963
about your little
brotherly bond?

00:18:02.063 --> 00:18:03.332
Or about you?

00:18:03.432 --> 00:18:06.204
Or the Revolutionary
Army's plans?

00:18:08.944 --> 00:18:11.247
This is between me and him.

00:18:13.753 --> 00:18:16.859
Just you and him?
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:18:16.959 --> 00:18:17.894
[gasps]

00:18:24.408 --> 00:18:27.113
Thanks for the prize.

00:18:27.213 --> 00:18:30.419
Cheater! That fruit was
supposed to be mine!

00:18:31.455 --> 00:18:35.262
[SABO]
Ace! I take your ability.

00:18:35.363 --> 00:18:39.772
Fire Fist!

00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:47.687
Bastard! That was you?

00:18:47.788 --> 00:18:49.191
[chuckles]

00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:52.063
What? He ate it?

00:18:52.163 --> 00:18:55.236
Hey, Luffy. I'm sorry
I can't do more.

00:18:55.336 --> 00:18:57.473
Doflamingo's on his way over,

00:18:57.574 --> 00:19:00.212
and I'm gonna have my hands
pretty full with this guy.

00:19:00.313 --> 00:19:02.617
[cackles]

00:19:02.717 --> 00:19:05.290
I'll be fine. Cats and
those other dudes

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.926
said they'd buy
more time for me.

00:19:07.026 --> 00:19:08.429
The name's Gyats!

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.332
Then I can take care
of Mingo, no problem!

00:19:10.433 --> 00:19:13.507
Wow, you're the man
with the plan, aren't ya?

00:19:13.607 --> 00:19:15.276
Then leave this to me!

00:19:15.376 --> 00:19:20.621
Sabo. Ace's fruit. You ate it?

00:19:20.721 --> 00:19:23.760
[chuckles] Well, I couldn't
give it up, could I?

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.764
It was our brother's.

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:30.907
Yeah! Good thinking!

00:19:31.007 --> 00:19:33.713
That ability's gonna
be mine, little man!

00:19:33.813 --> 00:19:35.016
Keep him safe, Pets!

00:19:35.116 --> 00:19:37.654
My name's Gyats,
but I've got him!

00:19:37.755 --> 00:19:39.926
[cackles]

00:19:40.026 --> 00:19:44.301
Galleon Lariat!

00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:45.770
[COMPETITORS gasp]

00:19:53.051 --> 00:19:55.924
[GYATS gasps]

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.712
Now, Burning Dragon Claw Fist!

00:20:09.183 --> 00:20:11.354
[gasps]

00:20:12.423 --> 00:20:15.062
[BURGESS screams]

00:20:15.162 --> 00:20:17.934
[BURGESS]
That's hot!

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.380
And Flame Dragon King!

00:20:34.434 --> 00:20:35.871
Burgess lost?

00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:37.875
That guy works for
one of the Four Emperors!

00:20:37.975 --> 00:20:39.277
Yeah, but Sabo?

00:20:39.377 --> 00:20:41.916
That guy's a big shot
Revolutionary!

00:20:48.195 --> 00:20:51.168
As soon as he saw the
Flame-Flame Fruit's power,

00:20:51.268 --> 00:20:54.140
he turned all of
his attention to me.

00:20:54.975 --> 00:20:57.480
[SABO] I guess that means
the rumors were true.

00:20:58.817 --> 00:21:00.285
[SABO]
Burgess is hunting down people

00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:02.757
who possess
Devil Fruit abilities.

00:21:08.135 --> 00:21:10.808
Hold on, Lucy! I'm confused!

00:21:10.908 --> 00:21:12.410
I thought you won
the competition

00:21:12.511 --> 00:21:14.681
and got the Flame-Flame Fruit!

00:21:14.782 --> 00:21:17.220
[LUFFY] The Lucy in
the last round wasn't me.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.990
[GYATS]
Huh?!

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:22.162
[LUFFY] I had to go somewhere,
so Sabo fought in my place.

00:21:22.263 --> 00:21:25.036
That's a balatan violation
of tournament rules!

00:21:25.136 --> 00:21:26.772
But I suppose it all worked out.

00:21:26.873 --> 00:21:29.143
Right! Taking over your
deceased brother's ability

00:21:29.243 --> 00:21:31.815
was a noble goal, indeed!

00:21:31.915 --> 00:21:34.220
And besides, giving you
a chance to recover

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.224
and overthrow Doflamingo
is the only hope

00:21:36.324 --> 00:21:38.596
our kingdom has left
at this point!

00:21:44.708 --> 00:21:47.313
[COMPETITORS scream]

00:21:47.413 --> 00:21:48.415
[GYATS gasps]

00:22:27.326 --> 00:22:29.732
[COMPETITOR L groans]
We've been wearing him down,

00:22:29.832 --> 00:22:31.936
but he's still got
so much strength!

00:22:32.036 --> 00:22:35.075
Don't give up now!
We have to keep stalling him!

00:22:37.548 --> 00:22:39.083
[COMPETITOR P screams]

00:22:39.183 --> 00:22:40.954
You're nothing but flies!

00:22:41.054 --> 00:22:42.958
I could kill the lot of you
with my eyes closed

00:22:43.058 --> 00:22:45.296
if I didn't have
more important business!

00:22:45.396 --> 00:22:48.168
Now come and face me, Straw Hat.

00:22:48.268 --> 00:22:50.807
I'll make you regret this.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.447
[DOFLAMINGO]
I said face me!

00:23:14.286 --> 00:23:17.026
[NARRATOR] Zoro and Franky
attempt to stop the Birdcage.

00:23:17.126 --> 00:23:20.032
But the strings are closing in
at increasing speed,

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:23.172
as if to strangle the very hopes
of Dressrosa's people.

00:23:23.272 --> 00:23:26.244
Then, just when it appears that
Luffy may not recover in time,

00:23:26.344 --> 00:23:27.815
a bright and miraculous light

00:23:27.915 --> 00:23:29.885
shines upon the
crumbling kingdom!

00:23:29.985 --> 00:23:31.789
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.889 --> 00:23:34.795
"Tears of Miracles!
Mansherry's Fight!"

00:23:34.895 --> 00:23:37.767
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
