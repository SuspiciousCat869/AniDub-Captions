1
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,874
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,334
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,003
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,671
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:00,175
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:04,512
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:10,310
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:18,109
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:22,614
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:25,825
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:27,911
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:32,999
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:38,296
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,217
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,136
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,097
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,477
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,354
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:59,317
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,361
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:07,117
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,207
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:22,007
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:30,390
[NARRATOR]
The Almighty Eneru's plan

25
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:34,477
was about to enter
its final stage...

26
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:37,272
...when Luffy arrived
to challenge him.

27
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:43,737
[NARRATOR]
But after a fierce battle,

28
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,073
the young pirate was
thrown from the ark.

29
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,795
What's wrong? You're lucky
to have made it this far.

30
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,256
Abandon all thoughts of your
incompetent playmates

31
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,218
and embrace the glorious
future I've given you.

32
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:10,889
Yeah, thanks.
You're a swell guy.

33
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,934
But one thing's more
precious than gold.

34
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:17,645
It's a treasure
called friendship.

35
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:19,356
This island is
filled with riches

36
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,982
I'd love to get my hands on.

37
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:23,860
But sacrificing my friends
and enduring your ego

38
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:27,155
is too steep a price to pay.
So, your treasure?

39
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:31,117
It's yours. I don't want it!

40
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:33,620
[USOPP yells]

41
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:39,334
God of the White Sea or not,
if he lays a finger on Nami,

42
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:42,379
I'll be his personal
Blue Sea nightmare!

43
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:47,050
[SANJI]
Nami-swan!

44
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:53,014
[LUFFY]
"The Two Awaken!

45
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,393
On the Front Lines of the
Burning Love Rescue!"

46
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:11,783
[ENERU] If you do not wish
to be aboard this ship,

47
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:14,911
there is but one
path left for you.

48
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:18,957
[ENERU]
Hm. Death... So long.

49
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:25,088
[NAMI] There's no way I can
possibly beat this guy!

50
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:28,925
But I'm not gonna stay on
this ship, that's for sure.

51
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:31,011
I have no regrets!

52
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:34,139
[ENERU] Yes. I know
what you're thinking.

53
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:36,975
And by now I'm sure you
realize you won't be

54
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:40,020
leaving this ark safely.

55
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:41,479
That is...

56
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:44,816
...unless you're pinning your
hopes on those two rats,

57
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:47,068
who've just snuck on board.

58
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,486
--[gasps]
--[ENERU laughs]

59
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:03,084
[USOPP]
Lemme off this crazy thing!

60
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,461
Sanji, listen!

61
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:07,380
If we go any higher, we won't
be able to get down!

62
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:09,591
Not to mention the fact
that God is on board!

63
00:05:09,674 --> 00:05:11,176
Or had you forgotten?

64
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,429
[SANJI grunts]
We're already here, stupid!

65
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:15,972
So just deal with it!

66
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,891
[USOPP] But what are
we gonna do, Sanji?

67
00:05:17,974 --> 00:05:21,353
Look at the size of this thing!
I've seen smaller mountains!

68
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,563
There could be hundreds
of guys on board!

69
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:25,565
We can't fight them all!

70
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:30,070
Besides. If God or those
Priests are here...

71
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:32,530
Oh, just get over it already!

72
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:35,867
You're the one who's always
prepared for this kinda stuff!

73
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,869
You got all the cool equipment!

74
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:41,748
Well, this? Not what I had
in mind when I made 'em!

75
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:46,503
[SANJI] Ugh. Well, the bad
guys've got that Mantra ability.

76
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:48,254
They can predict
our moves!

77
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:50,590
No point in trying to be sneaky!

78
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:52,884
In fact, I'd bet my
favorite carving knife

79
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:54,427
they already know we're here!

80
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:58,098
They know we're here?
So what are we supposed to do?

81
00:05:58,181 --> 00:06:00,684
[SANJI]
Stop freakin' out for starters.

82
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:01,976
Once we're safely inside,

83
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,396
we'll split up and
head for the main deck.

84
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,314
Nami's got to be up there.

85
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:09,609
Hold on! Did you say split up?

86
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:12,570
Are you out of your mind?!
Why would we do that?

87
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:15,365
We have no idea how many
bad guys are onboard!

88
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:17,784
Just getting up here was
dangerous enough!

89
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:19,160
You dumbass!

90
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:22,038
[USOPP gasps]

91
00:06:22,122 --> 00:06:25,208
[SANJI] If we don't split up,
we could both die.

92
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,918
[gulps]
Both die?

93
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:29,629
I don't suppose you'd
care to elaborate.

94
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:34,926
Wait a minute.
You're not gonna--

95
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:40,181
You mean, to save Nami...

96
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:43,435
[SANJI]
Usopp. Listen to me.

97
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:46,730
If it'll save Nami, I'll
gladly sacrifice your life.

98
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:48,940
You jerk, why I oughta--!

99
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:51,526
All right then!
I'm coming, Nami!

100
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:53,486
I'm not done yellin' at you!

101
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,739
[SANJI]
Hold on, Nami-swan!

102
00:06:55,822 --> 00:07:01,077
[USOPP] Wait, Sanji!
Hold on! Please! Buddy! Pal!

103
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:05,582
[ENERU laughs]

104
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:09,294
[ENERU] It seems they're quite
serious about your rescue.

105
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:11,755
Fools to the bitter end.

106
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:14,215
[NAMI]
Who can it be?

107
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,718
No one besides Luffy
can still move.

108
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:19,763
Besides, how could they even
get on board the ark?

109
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:26,102
[gasps]

110
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:27,812
[NAMI shouts]

111
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:33,401
--[NAMI gasps]
--[ENERU laughs]

112
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:35,153
Though help may have arrived,

113
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:38,782
it doesn't mean you've
been saved yet.

114
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:42,035
Nor am I obligated
to wait for them.

115
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:49,167
[NAMI] All I can do
is jump overboard

116
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,627
and hope for the best.

117
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,381
If I stay here,
I'm dead for sure.

118
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:57,926
I'm up against lightning.
What else can I do?

119
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,850
[SANJI grunts]

120
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:12,732
What's all this?

121
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:23,118
[SANJI]
Huh?

122
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:34,546
It looks like this
whole ship is automated.

123
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:38,341
Heh. Guess that means he doesn't
need henchmen or underlings.

124
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:45,265
[SANJI]
Creepy bastard.

125
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:47,392
[USOPP pants]

126
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:50,562
[USOPP] There's no one here!
But this ship is huge!

127
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:53,314
Does it run without
anyone operating it?

128
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:55,400
And how does it fly, anyway?

129
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:58,194
I've never heard of
a flying ship before!

130
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:00,113
Just the thought of being
up in the air like this

131
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:03,616
makes my knees all wobbly!
I feel sick!

132
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,910
I wonder what the power
source for this thing is?

133
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:09,914
Oh, what do I care, as long as
it doesn't decide to fall!

134
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:11,499
Wait! I just realized!

135
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,043
Even if Nami is on
the upper deck,

136
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:15,170
we're way too high
up now to jump off!

137
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:17,339
What the hell are we gonna do?

138
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:46,993
The sky. It keeps
getting darker.

139
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:50,830
He's going to begin the
Great Destruction soon.

140
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:54,959
And then, he'll steal
the Golden Bell.

141
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:57,003
And take it up with him.

142
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:04,803
[CITIZENS yelling]

143
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:08,932
[CITIZEN A] Onto the boats!
Don't get left behind!

144
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:10,684
[CITIZEN B]
Hurry to the White Sea!

145
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:13,645
We're running out of time!

146
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:16,606
Look at it. It's terrifying!

147
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,567
This is really it!
The end of the world!

148
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:24,155
[SHANDORIAN A]
Leave the village? But Chief.

149
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:25,657
What about the warriors?

150
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,827
They're still not back
from Upper Yard!

151
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,745
[SHANDORIAN CHIEFTAIN]
There is no need to wait.

152
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:32,872
[SHANDORIANS gasp]

153
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:33,915
But Chief...

154
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:35,750
We have no choice.

155
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,253
The warriors aren't children,

156
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:41,256
they can avoid the
dangers they face.

157
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,091
Have faith in them.

158
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:49,723
Eneru will destroy everything.
We know that.

159
00:10:49,806 --> 00:10:52,809
Just as he did to his
homeland, Birka.

160
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:58,398
So too shall he do here.
We must escape.

161
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:01,443
Now. We must prepare the ships!

162
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:05,155
Our first task is to save the
lives of the villagers here!

163
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:08,616
[SHANDORIANS murmur]

164
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:16,791
[SHANDORIAN CHIEFTAIN]
Everything is coming to an end.

165
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,627
Wyper. Let it go.

166
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:22,213
You've done
everything you could.

167
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,552
[CONIS] Did you come from
the Blue Sea World?

168
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:28,762
[LUFFY]
If that's what you call it.

169
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:31,097
We sailed up a river
of clouds to get here.

170
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:33,975
Speaking of "here",
is this is your home?

171
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,852
[CONIS] Everything is
happening in this forest

172
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:37,354
right in front of me.

173
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:40,273
And I have no way to
know what's going on!

174
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,861
[CONIS]
All I can do is wait!

175
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:46,613
[SUU]
Suu?

176
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:50,367
[CONIS] Everyone.
I hope you're all safe!

177
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:01,753
[sobs]

178
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:03,922
[AISA]
Horsey-Bird! Horsey-Bird!

179
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:07,217
I'm sorry! You were
trying to protect me!

180
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:13,890
[LUFFY]
Aisa! Aisa!

181
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:15,975
Aisa!

182
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,853
Luffy? Are you alive?

183
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:20,313
Where are you?

184
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:26,444
[LUFFY]
Over here! This way! Aisa!

185
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:29,239
--[gasps]
--[LUFFY] Aisa!

186
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:32,325
Hey! Help me out!
Here! Here! Here!

187
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:34,869
How did you land like that?

188
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:37,205
[LUFFY grunts]

189
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:44,629
[grunting continues]

190
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,798
All right. Dammit!

191
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:49,050
I can't get this
golden ball off!

192
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:51,219
[AISA]
Hey, watch your mouth!

193
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:53,221
[LUFFY] Let's just get
back to that beanstalk

194
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:54,472
where Robin was!

195
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:56,725
I won't let Eneru
get away with this!

196
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:58,518
Okay!

197
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:02,022
Nice try, jerk, but it takes
a lot more to stop me!

198
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:05,734
Your ark's toast! And I know
just where to find you!

199
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:28,298
[NAMI gasps]

200
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:33,386
[pants]

201
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,891
[ENERU laughs]

202
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:43,063
Congratulations, young lady,
that was rather amusing!

203
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:46,858
I did it.

204
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:50,904
[ENERU] Such clever toys you
have down on the Blue Sea.

205
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:52,238
[gasps]

206
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,451
[NAMI]
Thunder Ball!

207
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:00,413
[gasps]

208
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:05,251
[ENERU] Creating a path for
the lightning to follow.

209
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:07,087
A clever tactic.

210
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,299
You're obviously well-acquainted
with weather phenomena.

211
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,592
[gasps]

212
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:15,136
[NAMI]
But, it's not enough!

213
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,555
[ENERU laughs]

214
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,183
You realize,
of course, it's futile.

215
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:22,185
All I need do is
raise the voltage

216
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:25,105
and your trick
won't work. Will it?

217
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:30,777
Now, I'm a very
busy man. Begone!

218
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,986
[gasps]

219
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,447
[NAMI]
Can't dodge this one!

220
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:38,076
Why don't you begone?
Exploding Star!

221
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,037
[gasps]

222
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,219
[USOPP]
Oops. I'm sorry.

223
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:57,971
Usopp?

224
00:14:58,054 --> 00:15:01,433
[ENERU] I know you.
From the ship.

225
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:07,897
[USOPP]
Hey! Where's Sanji?

226
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:10,358
[NAMI]
Sanji? He's here too?

227
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,485
[USOPP]
You mean he's not up here yet?!

228
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:14,154
[NAMI]
Wha...?

229
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:21,411
[gulps]

230
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:25,331
I see...

231
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:26,541
Later!

232
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:28,168
[NAMI]
Pansy!

233
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:33,256
[USOPP whimpers]

234
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:40,513
[USOPP] Be a man, Usopp.
What are you running for?

235
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:42,724
Bring it on, God!

236
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:45,185
[USOPP yelps]

237
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:47,937
[USOPP gasps]

238
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:51,024
Usopp!

00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:52,317
[grunts]

240
00:15:54,694 --> 00:15:56,321
[grunts]

241
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:57,530
[USOPP]
Nami!

242
00:15:57,614 --> 00:16:00,367
Yeah, what? Tell me
what to do, I'm on it!

243
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,326
Please save me.

244
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:02,827
Like hell!

245
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:05,705
I thought you came here to
save me, you spineless chicken!

246
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:09,084
Yeah, um. I'm not really sure
what's going on anymore.

247
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,086
Then what are you doing here?

248
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:12,587
Well...

249
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,589
Well, what? Get your rear in
gear and save me, right now!

250
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:19,386
How do I do that exactly?
We are fighting God.

251
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:20,220
Oh, yeah!

252
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:21,763
[BOTH chuckle]

253
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:24,391
[BOTH scream]

254
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,439
By the way, Nami,
about that hat.

255
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,024
Yeah, it's Luffy's.

256
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:36,444
He was here a little while ago,
but Eneru threw him overboard!

257
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,030
But he's not dead,
I'm sure of it.

258
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:40,532
[USOPP]
The ark's gaining altitude!

259
00:16:40,615 --> 00:16:42,367
We can't count on
Luffy to save us!

260
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,410
[NAMI]
Right.

261
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:44,452
[USOPP]
We gotta do this ourselves,

262
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,996
'cause I'm not a fan of dying!

263
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,873
[NAMI]
I'm with you there!

264
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,668
[grunts]

265
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:56,381
Huh?

266
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:58,633
Here. Come hide behind
this tube thingy!

267
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,677
I'm bettin' it's
pretty important.

268
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,887
So he might not use
his big attacks!

269
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:05,849
Usopp! Look over there!

270
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:08,143
[USOPP]
Huh? Ah! A Waver!

271
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:10,520
[NAMI]
We'll have to jump off on that!

272
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:12,856
Jump from this height?!
Are you nuts?

273
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:14,399
[NAMI]
No, look!

274
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:17,193
There's a patch of Island Cloud
in the middle of the forest!

275
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:20,155
If we can reach that,
we just might make it!

276
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:21,823
[gasps]
Of course!

277
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:25,076
[gasps]

278
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,369
[USOPP]
Dammit!

279
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:30,623
[USOPP grunts]

280
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:39,966
I'll go try to create
a diversion! Get it ready!

281
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,842
[NAMI]
Right!

282
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:43,553
[USOP warbles]
Take this, God!

283
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:47,265
Behold! Usopp Spell!

284
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:56,149
[USOPP] A splinter embeds itself
deep under your fingernail!

285
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:59,444
[NAMI] Ugh! That hurts just
thinking about it!

286
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:02,906
[USOPP] Cover your ears, you
idiot, this stuff can kill you!

287
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:07,744
[USOPP]
A piece of paper...

288
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:10,163
...cuts across the
skin of your knuckles!

289
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:17,420
Five canker sores!
Inflaming your gums!

290
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:20,090
[gasps]

291
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,927
Usopp, no!

292
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:28,515
[NAMI] Gotta get
this thing running.

293
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:31,184
We're only gonna get
one chance to escape!

294
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:35,438
[USOPP groans]

295
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:38,066
[NAMI]
Hang on...

296
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:46,241
[NAMI]
Looks good.

297
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:49,202
The Island Cloud is directly
below that beanstalk!

298
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:50,912
I'm ready, let's get--

299
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:53,873
[gasps]

300
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:55,041
[USOPP groans]

301
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,085
[gasping continues]

302
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:01,131
[NAMI]
Usopp!

303
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:08,138
[ENERU] Though you may
desperately want to run away...

304
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:11,433
...facing me, it will
not be that simple.

305
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:13,601
[gasps]

306
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,187
But please, do try it again.

307
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:20,025
I always enjoy a
deadly game of tag.

308
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:23,987
[ENERU laughs]

309
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:33,079
Usopp, grab my hand!

310
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:34,789
[grunts]

311
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,332
Come on!

312
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:41,671
[gasps]

313
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:51,181
For you, there is no
hope of salvation.

314
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,185
Usopp!

315
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:56,644
[gasps]

316
00:19:58,438 --> 00:20:01,149
[USOPP yells]

317
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:02,442
[gasps]

318
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,779
[NAMI, USOPP gasp]

319
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:08,740
Get going.

320
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:09,449
El...

321
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:10,992
Sanji, run!

322
00:20:11,826 --> 00:20:13,036
[USOPP]
Gun it, Nami!

323
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:16,247
[ENERU]
...Thor!

324
00:20:22,712 --> 00:20:25,006
[NAMI] Usopp, wait!
Let off the gas!

325
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,174
What about Sanji?

326
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:28,385
[USOPP] Don't stop!
We've gotta escape!

327
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:33,056
Now stop making my plan
sound bad! And keep going!

328
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,604
[USOPP, NAMI yell]

329
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:50,573
[ENERU laughs]
So they jumped.

330
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:54,119
Do they still not understand
the range of my powers?

331
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:58,540
They haven't escaped me
in the slightest.

332
00:20:58,623 --> 00:20:59,833
Hm?

333
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,876
[SANJI grunts]

334
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,254
[SANJI]
Hey, God.

335
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:07,048
There's something I
wanted to tell you.

336
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:12,137
[SANJI]
Oh... But first...

337
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:17,267
...I... should thank you.

338
00:21:21,438 --> 00:21:25,984
I was looking...
for a light. 'preciate it.

339
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:31,364
Right. Do you have a point?

340
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:36,995
Yeah, get ready to cry, bastard.

341
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:42,709
[ENERU]
Hm.

342
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,592
[ENERU]
Hm?

343
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,389
[gasps]

344
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,105
[ENERU]
Wh-What is this? The ark!

345
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:08,151
Get ready to cry, bastard.

346
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:12,280
You fool. You didn't...

347
00:22:14,074 --> 00:22:15,617
[ENERU]
Damn you!

348
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,955
You did something below deck!
What have you done to my ark?

349
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,457
[gasps]

350
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:31,716
<i>When you're lost and alone,</i>
<i>I can always hear your voice</i>

351
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,888
<i>While you wander far from home,</i>
<i>gazing up at the sky</i>

352
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:39,641
<i>You are just like the moon</i>

353
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:44,437
<i>You never change as</i>
<i>you climb into the night</i>

354
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:52,904
<i>But your reflection wanes,</i>
<i>then you disappear,</i>

355
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:56,908
<i>fading so suddenly...</i>

356
00:22:56,991 --> 00:23:02,163
<i>Stay as you are,</i>
<i>don't lose your way</i>

357
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:11,089
<i>Let these words guide you,</i>
<i>don't ever look back!</i>

358
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>Don't give up on your dreams,</i>
<i>through endless nights</i>

359
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,303
<i>they come to you</i>

360
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:22,767
<i>Again and again, until you</i>
<i>see them shining through!</i>

361
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:28,648
<i>You may not return,</i>
<i>I hope that you'll learn</i>

362
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:35,363
<i>to put your past behind,</i>
<i>and just keep moving on</i>

363
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:43,371
[USOPP]
Look at that lightning!

364
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,540
We'll be blasted to
dust if we stay here!

365
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:46,750
[NAMI]
Get to the ship!

366
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,586
We gotta escape before
this land is destroyed!

367
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:51,546
[AISA]
Are the sky islands doomed?

368
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:54,674
[ENERU] Now then,
let us begin the festivities.

369
00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:57,135
[NAMI] There's no safe
haven left in Skypiea.

370
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:58,928
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

371
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:00,722
"Capriccio for Despair!

372
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:03,433
The Impending Doom
of Sky Island!"

373
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:06,019
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
