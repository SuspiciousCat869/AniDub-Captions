1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,199
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:40,668
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:45,340
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:50,378
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:53,448
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:57,018
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,254
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:02,690
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,660
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:09,130
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,636
[MORIA]
Kushishi!

48
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:17,438
I didn't know it was
such a beautiful night out!

49
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:20,141
It's... Moria.

50
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:21,175
It's Moria!

51
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,545
Moria? What, where?

52
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,480
[MORIA]
Dawn is just around the corner.

53
00:03:25,513 --> 00:03:26,748
Do you think
this is the best time

54
00:03:26,781 --> 00:03:28,983
for you to be standing around?

55
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:30,251
Wait, how are you here?

56
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:31,586
Huh?

57
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:33,721
I hear Master,
but I can't see him.

58
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,058
Kushishishi...

59
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,327
...shishishi!

60
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,595
Usopp!

61
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:49,537
[SANJI]
Did he get him?

62
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:51,673
[SANJI]
Usopp!

63
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,176
[CHOPPER]
Usopp!

64
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,113
Kushishishi!

65
00:03:59,147 --> 00:04:00,048
This is bad.

66
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:01,349
With Moria inside Oars,

67
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:04,018
that idiot actually
has a brain now.

68
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:05,653
[CHOPPER]
Usopp!

69
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:08,122
Answer me! Where are you?

70
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:10,024
[BROOK]
He's perfectly fine!

71
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,564
I thought we might
need a hefty quantity of salt,

72
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:18,433
so I rounded some up!

73
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,734
[SANJI, ZORO, CHOPPER]
Brook?

74
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,502
That was a close one!

75
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:26,074
[LUFFY]
"Secret Plan to Turn the Tables!

76
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:28,276
Nightmare Luffy
Makes His Appearance!"

77
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:34,682
Yohohoho!

78
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:35,550
Hey, you're back.

79
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,118
I thought you were
too hurt to fight!

80
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,086
Did something happen?

81
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,554
You look a lot better now!

82
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:41,723
[USOPP] You really saved my
life back there--that was scary.

83
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:42,991
[BROOK]
It's true.

84
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:45,493
I was seriously injured when I
dragged myself to the kitchen

85
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:46,494
to acquire this salt,

86
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:48,830
but then something
most fortuitous happened.

87
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:50,765
I discovered
some delicious milk,

88
00:04:50,798 --> 00:04:54,535
which I promptly consumed,
thus recovering my health!

89
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:57,205
Calcium doesn't
act that fast! Come on!

90
00:04:57,805 --> 00:04:59,407
So there you have it, everyone!

91
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,743
Milk can heal your broken bones!

92
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:02,577
[USOPP]
Liar!

93
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,847
Anyway, we have
the salt we need now.

94
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,682
This should be
enough to purify that giant,

95
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:09,384
but it might be a close call.

96
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:10,318
And speaking of close calls,

97
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,387
it looks like the
kitchen's blocked off.

98
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,323
In other words, we only
get one chance to do this.

99
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,591
We don't have much time.

100
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:18,092
Let's move it.

101
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:19,761
If we don't wanna melt
when the sun rises,

102
00:05:19,794 --> 00:05:21,462
we have two objectives.

103
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:25,433
We gotta feed the salt to that
monster and we gotta beat Moria.

104
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:29,370
[MORIA]
Kushishishi!

105
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:38,212
[USOPP thinking]
Yep. I'm scared.

106
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:39,747
[BROOK thinking]
I am very scared.

107
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:40,715
You guys got any idea

108
00:05:40,748 --> 00:05:43,151
how to get to
that thing's mouth, though?

109
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:45,353
It's like climbing a tower
with fists and teeth.

110
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,458
Kushishi!

111
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:52,794
You wanted a chance to
get your shadows back from me.

112
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:55,430
Well, here I am,
go ahead and try!

113
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:56,497
But I'll warn you,

114
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:58,866
I'm more than just a
passenger in Oars' stomach!

115
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,801
When I'm done with you,

116
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:02,336
you'll wish you'd
melted away in the sun!

117
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,506
I'll show you what
real nightmares are made of!

118
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,377
Kushishishi!

119
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,646
Yohohoho!

120
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:13,548
Thank you for
this chance, Straw Hats.

121
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,383
I swear that I
shall fight beside you

122
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,251
with every ounce of my might!

123
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:19,220
Although this small
gesture scarcely repays

124
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,855
the debt I owe you
for recovering my shadow,

125
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:23,191
I shall offer
what assistance I can.

126
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:24,726
Now, let's gooo!

127
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,161
Ouch.

128
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:28,796
We don't need you
breaking any more bones,

129
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,898
so just hold on to
the salt and take it easy.

130
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:33,468
[SANJI]
Let's go.

131
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:34,302
[CHOPPER]
Right.

132
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:36,237
I got a few
tricks up my sleeves.

133
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,372
Let's try my
Anti-Monster shells.

134
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,876
All right, pal.

135
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:44,312
If my last shot
was too small, try this!

136
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:45,546
Franky, are you ready?

137
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,516
We're gonna light this zombie
up with my Special Oil Star!

138
00:06:49,884 --> 00:06:52,186
Sweet! Here I go!

139
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,725
Ignite!

140
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,727
Super-size...

141
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:02,230
...Firebird Star!

142
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:07,602
[OARS]
Hot! Hot hot hot!

143
00:07:09,237 --> 00:07:09,904
All right!

144
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:11,339
How do you like that one, jerk?

145
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:13,608
Nice job, let's
move on to the next step!

146
00:07:15,743 --> 00:07:18,412
Ouchie ouchie ouchie.

147
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:19,547
You'll be fine.

148
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,249
Don't let a little
fire get to you!

149
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:23,751
Those feelings of pain are
nothing but lingering memories

150
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:25,253
from back when you were alive.

151
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:26,687
It's all in your head!

152
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,624
Zombies don't have to worry
about any of that nonsense.

153
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,927
Just calm down and
put out the fire, you'll see!

154
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:37,231
You're right, it's not
so hot. Boy, I look silly.

155
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:40,334
This is our chance, Zoro! C'mon!

156
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:41,369
[ZORO]
Got it!

157
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,403
All right, Three Sword Style:

158
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:18,606
Great Buddha Chop!

159
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:25,646
[SANJI]
My turn. Jenga Cannon!

160
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,623
Again and again
and again and again and again!

161
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:43,998
[OARS]
Take... this!

162
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,271
[BROOK]
Yo-ho!

163
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,740
[FRANKY]
It's comin' straight at us!

164
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:56,577
Veinte Fleur
should do the trick!

165
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:02,550
Damn it. No fair!

166
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:12,093
He's using our
own attacks against us!

167
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:14,428
Sorry 'bout that!
You guys okay?

168
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:30,845
Behold my new weapon.
The Stag Beetle!

169
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:35,917
[FRANKY]
Let's go, go, go, go!

170
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,451
Yeah!

171
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,087
Super!

172
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,188
Well, glad you're super,

173
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:43,791
but I don't think I can hold
this thing much longer.

174
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:44,692
Can you hurry it up?

175
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:47,495
Hell yeah,
I'm ready whenever you are!

176
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:49,430
Just a word of warning.

177
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,599
I haven't had a
chance to test this thing.

178
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,601
So I don't know what'll
happen when I let it loose.

179
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,403
You think I
can't handle this, bro?

180
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:56,938
Ha. I'm extra super this week!

181
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,806
I got it under control!

182
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:00,541
[USOPP]
All right, then get in!

183
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:01,809
[FRANKY]
Roger!

184
00:10:01,842 --> 00:10:04,478
Now shoot me straight into that
thing's stomach and we got this!

185
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:10,985
[USOPP]
Special Attack. Iron Man Comet!

186
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,389
Nice! Now this
is some super speed.

187
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,424
Get ready!

188
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:19,026
This mortar cannon
of mine was specially made

189
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,396
to take down Sea Kings
and jerks like you!

190
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,600
I'm gonna wipe that smug grin
right off your face, Moria!

191
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,072
I keep forgetting he's so fast!

192
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:32,540
He might not look like him.

193
00:10:32,573 --> 00:10:34,709
But he's got
Luffy's moves for sure!

194
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,052
Franky, no!

195
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:53,819
Please, don't die!

196
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:16,934
[MORIA]
Don't stop now, Oars!

197
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,470
That was a nice shot,
but I'm afraid he's still alive.

198
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:21,205
Why don't you stomp on him?

199
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,307
[OARS]
Okay.

200
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:37,855
Kushishishi!

201
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:39,256
Damn it,
he's gonna finish him off!

202
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,292
Stop! He can't even move!

203
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,427
Franky!

204
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:49,767
[NAMI]
Thunderbolt....

205
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:52,269
Look! That cloud!

206
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:53,304
[NAMI]
...Tempo!

207
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:03,914
I don't know what's
going on, but I want it to stop!

208
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:06,383
Oars, can you pound
whoever's doing this?

209
00:12:12,556 --> 00:12:14,525
Nice shot,
but where did it come from?

210
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:17,161
Lightning. it has to be her!

211
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,462
That's the Clima Tact!

212
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:20,931
Dunno where she is,
but Nami's fine!

213
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:24,769
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 370A]
What was that flash?

214
00:12:24,802 --> 00:12:25,603
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 370B]
Was it lightning?

215
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:27,171
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 370C]
How frightening!

216
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,339
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 370D]
That must've been Oars.

217
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,441
I mean, he can
do anything, right?

218
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:36,881
[SANJI]
There she is! It's Nami!

219
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:38,015
[SANJI]
Hey, Nami!

220
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,217
Over here! Over here! Over here!

221
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:44,855
Nami swan!

222
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,524
Could you stop yelling already?

223
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,459
Now they're gonna
know where I am!

224
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,497
[SANJI]
She yelled at me!

225
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:57,034
She yelled at me!
Just like old times!

226
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,536
I'm so glad you're safe!

227
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,337
Yell at me more, Nami!

228
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:02,239
I'm so sorry
I couldn't save you!

229
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:03,574
You can tell me
how stupid I am

230
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:04,909
--all night long!
[ZORO] Would you shut up?

231
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:08,546
[OARS]
It's the girl.

232
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,481
[NAMI]
See? I told you!

233
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:13,551
We've got Straw Hats
popping out of the woodwork!

234
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,886
All right, Oars.
You know what to do.

235
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,088
Smash her just like
you smashed the last guy!

236
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:21,358
Okay, Master. Gum-Gum...

237
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:22,493
[NAMI]
Huh?

238
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:24,595
Wait, he's not gonna stretch,
is he? I mean, can he?

239
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:27,031
[CHOPPER]
It shouldn't reach her, right?

240
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:29,500
Usopp, hurry!
You gotta get Franky outta here!

241
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:30,534
Right!

242
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:35,306
...Pistol.

243
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:44,849
[CHOPPER]
What?

244
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:57,061
He... he stretched! Impossible!

245
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,101
Hey, it worked.

246
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,037
That was new,
but it doesn't feel new.

247
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:09,573
Kushishishi!

248
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:10,975
You've gotta be kidding me!

249
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:12,576
--Nami, no!
--Nami!

250
00:14:16,247 --> 00:14:18,849
[CHOPPER] Look!
Up there! She's okay!

251
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,119
She sure is screaming a lot,

252
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,088
but at least Robin caught her!

253
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,995
That was certainly a surprise.

254
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:32,997
You're not hurt, are you?

255
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,333
[NAMI] No, just shaken up.
Thank you.

256
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:39,970
I don't get it,
but I know it can't be good.

257
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,172
Two people can't have
the same Devil Fruit power.

258
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:44,642
Even if he has Luffy's shadow,
he shouldn't be able to do that.

259
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:53,083
Kushishishi!
Kushishishi!

260
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:55,986
[ZORO] It's Moria.
Must've been one of his tricks.

261
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,255
I'm gonna kill that guy.

262
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:00,658
Now, Gum-Gum...

263
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,593
...Whip!

264
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,495
Well this is just great,

265
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,630
now he's really like
a giant monster Luffy!

266
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:10,167
Stop it, Luffy,
you're destroying your own crew!

267
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:35,592
I gotta get back to the mansion.

268
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:39,263
Oh goodness!

269
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:42,232
I tripped him
with my little foot! Tee hee!

270
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:44,001
What the hell is with you guys?

271
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:45,569
I'm kinda in a hurry here, okay?

272
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:47,171
What do you want with me?

273
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:48,739
Yeah, sorry to
bug you like this.

274
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:50,741
But this is really
important, I promise!

275
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:52,509
We'll only take
a second of your time.

276
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:54,545
We've been looking
all over the place for you.

277
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,713
You're our only hope!

278
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,580
[LUFFY]
Huh?

279
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:58,582
They call the two of us
the Risky Bros.

280
00:15:58,615 --> 00:16:00,484
The gang here
is the Rolling Pirates,

281
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:02,286
and our Captain
is Lola the Proposer.

282
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:04,154
You wanna get back
to the mansion pronto

283
00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:06,590
so you can beat up
Gecko Moria. Right, pal?

284
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:09,660
Yeah, that's right.

285
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:11,695
Now could you tell me
what you want with me?

286
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:12,629
Listen, you're in luck,

287
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:14,298
'cause we just happen
to know the secret

288
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:15,632
to taking out Moria.

289
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,735
We can give you the
power to do it, too.

290
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,771
And all you gotta do
is kick his ass for us.

291
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:23,440
Moria's secret? Give me power?

292
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:24,641
[RISKY BRO. BROWN HAIR]
Yep!

293
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:27,611
Seriously, who
the hell are you guys?

294
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:29,446
[RISKY BRO. MASK]
Allow us to introduce you

295
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,482
to the Captain
of the Rolling Pirates.

296
00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:33,417
Lola the Proposer!

297
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,351
[RISKY BRO. BROWN HAIR]
Current proposal count:

298
00:16:34,385 --> 00:16:37,154
four thousand
four hundred forty three!

299
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,356
Oh my, aren't you handsome.

300
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,491
Will you marry me?

301
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:41,525
No thanks.

302
00:16:43,394 --> 00:16:44,328
Rejected!

303
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:46,663
That's four thousand
four hundred forty four!

304
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:48,532
Better luck next time!

305
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:51,735
Anyway, Moria took all
the Rolling Pirates' shadows,

306
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:53,604
so we're stuck
wandering this forest

307
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,239
'til someone gets them back.

308
00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:56,673
[LUFFY] Yeah, well,
he took my shadow, too.

309
00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:57,875
That's why I'm in a hurry!

310
00:16:57,908 --> 00:17:01,111
[LOLA] I won't take "no" for
an answer, Straw Hat Luffy.

311
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,179
You're a hero!

312
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:03,580
In all of
Thriller Bark's history,

313
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:06,450
nobody has been able to
wreak as much havoc as you!

314
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:09,753
You walloped
the Mysterious Three,

315
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:11,355
returned some
of the stolen shadows

316
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:13,490
and caused tons
of property damage!

317
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:15,559
We've had nothing but
misery in this crappy place

318
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:17,828
'til you showed up
and started kicking ass!

319
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,029
[RISKY BRO. MASK]
On the downside,

320
00:17:19,063 --> 00:17:21,398
it's kinda your fault that
they brought Oars back to life.

321
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:22,599
That maybe wasn't so great.

322
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:24,368
[RISKY BRO. BROWN HAIR] We
have a whole network of victims,

323
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:26,203
so we know everything
that's going on here.

324
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:28,739
We've been stuck here without
our shadows for three years!

325
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:31,408
I don't wanna spend the rest
of my life on this stupid ship!

326
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:32,609
If you guys beat Moria for us,

327
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:35,112
we can all get out of here
and finally see the sun again

328
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:36,046
after all this time!

329
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,315
But we've got another
problem right now.

330
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,451
Moria's making things
even tougher than usual.

331
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:41,819
You know where
that bastard's at?

332
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,154
He's camped out
inside Oars' stomach!

333
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,690
No way!
Did Oars eat Moria?

334
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:47,624
It's complicated.

335
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:50,160
He's in there
piloting him like a ship.

336
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,395
Anyway, the point is

337
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:53,330
you're gonna have to take out
that giant with your shadow.

338
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,433
Otherwise, you won't be able
to lay a finger on Moria.

339
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:58,435
But I figure you would
wanna beat him anyway

340
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,571
since he's giving your crew a
pounding out in the courtyard.

341
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:02,372
Are you serious?

342
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:04,575
Damn it, I gotta help
them before it's too late!

343
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:05,809
Not so fast!

344
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:10,347
Just sit tight for one second
and we'll show you our trick.

345
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,216
Trust me,
you are gonna love this!

346
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:14,818
All right, boys,
bring out the shadow!

347
00:18:14,852 --> 00:18:16,386
[RISKY BROS.]
Roger! Stay outta the way!

348
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,589
Shadow coming through!

349
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,557
You can grab them?

350
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:22,459
Once they're separated, yeah!

351
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:24,294
When you feed the zombies
a little bit of salt

352
00:18:24,328 --> 00:18:25,462
and they come flying out,

353
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:27,364
you can just nab 'em outta
the air with your bare hands

354
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,398
no problem!

355
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,501
Heave-ho!

356
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:32,836
[LUFFY] What're you doing?
Are you nuts?

357
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,871
[RISKY BRO. MASK]
Stay still!

358
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:39,643
[LUFFY] Stop it!
I feel like I'm gonna...

359
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,880
[RISKY BRO. MASK]
All right, it's in!

360
00:19:04,218 --> 00:19:05,619
So how is it?

361
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:07,654
You didn't lose
consciousness, did you?

362
00:19:13,293 --> 00:19:15,229
I'm fine.

363
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:16,497
All right,
I guess that's a start.

364
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,599
Can you use a sword?

365
00:19:18,632 --> 00:19:20,701
Nuh-uh, not as far as I know.

366
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:22,236
Bring the sword!

367
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:35,516
Huh?

368
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,484
Wait. How did I do that?

369
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,553
It's quite simple,

370
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:41,421
the shadow we just
stuffed inside you

371
00:19:41,455 --> 00:19:44,424
used to belong to a powerful
swordsman from the Navy.

372
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,260
[LUFFY] It's like Moria did
with my shadow.

373
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:47,661
Yeah, but since
you're still alive,

374
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:50,163
it adds the shadow's
fighting power to your own.

375
00:19:50,197 --> 00:19:52,132
The point is,
as long as you don't pass out,

376
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:54,268
we can stuff as many
shadows in you as we got!

377
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:56,203
[LOLA] Ever since we
figured out Moria's powers,

378
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,605
we've been waiting for the
chance to turn them against him!

379
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:01,508
With a little boost,
you'll be unstoppable!

380
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:04,478
We still have a whole
bunch of shadows left, too.

381
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:06,413
As long as you're tough
enough to withstand them,

382
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:08,148
we can give you
as many as you want

383
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:10,517
and your power
will grow with each one!

384
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:13,687
Okay, but why do you have so
many shadows in the first place?

385
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,689
The idea was to
purify a bunch of zombies

386
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:17,858
and find our own shadows,
not collect them.

387
00:20:17,891 --> 00:20:19,760
But even if we didn't know
who they belonged to,

388
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:22,629
it didn't seem right to
leave 'em with the zombies.

389
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:23,530
So we thought,
"what the hell,

390
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:26,233
might as well take
them back with us!"

391
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,134
There's one important thing

392
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,336
you gotta remember
about this, though.

393
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:32,239
As you know, putting a shadow
in a corpse makes a zombie.

394
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,574
But if your body
still has a soul,

395
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,275
the shadow won't stick around.

396
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:37,544
You'll only be powered up
for about 10 minutes.

397
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:38,812
After that,

398
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:42,249
all the shadows fly out and go
back to their original owners.

399
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,283
[RISKY BRO. BROWN HAIR]
Ya got it, pal?

400
00:20:43,317 --> 00:20:44,818
Just ten minutes, sink or swim.

401
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:46,486
We'll give you every
shadow we nabbed,

402
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,589
so you should be pretty
powerful when we're done.

403
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,424
[LUFFY]
Whoa! That's a lot!

404
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:52,759
Shadows or not,
the fog's clearing up.

405
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,228
We only have about 20
minutes before the sun rises

406
00:20:55,262 --> 00:20:56,763
and roasts all of us, anyway.

407
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,532
Our lives are in your hands.

408
00:20:58,565 --> 00:21:00,534
Steel your mind, Straw Hat.

409
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:01,635
When we tried this trick before,

410
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:04,304
we could only handle two
or three shadows ourselves.

411
00:21:04,338 --> 00:21:07,574
But you should be able to
do 20 or 30 no problem.

412
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:08,809
Huh?

413
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:10,344
Go for it, boys!

414
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:13,647
[LUFFY] Whoa, whoa,
I didn't agree to this!

415
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,515
At least slow down!

416
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:19,319
[LUFFY screaming]

417
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:24,458
I... I had no idea
this was possible.

418
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,294
I've never seen anyone with
so much willpower before.

419
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,631
Now I know he can do it.
He can beat Moria!

420
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,699
Whoa. That's all of them!

421
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:34,768
He took all 100 shadows!

422
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:36,269
Unbelievable!

423
00:21:36,303 --> 00:21:38,805
I sure am glad
he's fighting for our side!

424
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:49,883
Uh, hey buddy,

425
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,252
you doing okay
with all those shadows?

426
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:53,720
Still feeling like yourself?

427
00:21:53,754 --> 00:21:55,889
You're still
Straw Hat Luffy, right?

428
00:21:56,757 --> 00:22:00,694
[LUFFY]
Oh yeah. Heh. It's me.

429
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:08,201
I'm getting stronger and
stronger. I can feel it.

430
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:21,248
Here, Straw Hat.
We got you a sword!

431
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:26,887
He seems kinda
different, you know?

432
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,690
I mean, it's not
my imagination, is it?

433
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,325
'Cause I'm pretty sure
he used to be smaller.

434
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,460
It's beautiful!

435
00:22:33,493 --> 00:22:36,329
I feel like I want to
propose to him all over again!

436
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:41,968
[LUFFY]
They all want to fight.

437
00:22:42,002 --> 00:22:45,472
The shadows want to fight now!

438
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,811
Then let them go wild!

439
00:22:50,844 --> 00:22:52,612
Hurry, there's not much time.

440
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:55,415
Just ten minutes to show
Moria the meaning of terror!

441
00:22:55,449 --> 00:22:57,017
It's time to
escape from this hell!

442
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,352
Now get going, Nightmare Luffy!

443
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:08,795
[LUFFY]
I'm coming for you, Moria!

444
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:10,497
[RISKY BROS.]
Hey, come back!

445
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,700
The mansion's the other way!

446
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:22,476
[NAMI] How is Oars' body able to
stretch and contract like that?

447
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:24,511
[ROBIN] It's not.
Take a closer look.

448
00:23:24,544 --> 00:23:25,512
[NAMI]
Huh? What do you mean?

449
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:27,748
[ROBIN] It looks like
Oars' body is changing

450
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,716
to match the
movements of his shadow.

451
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,817
[NAMI]
Not good.

452
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:33,520
Moria's powers can do
more than we ever imagined!

453
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:35,021
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

454
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:37,357
"The Straw Hat Crew
gets Wiped Out!

455
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,960
The Shadow-Shadow's
Power is in Full Swing!"

456
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:42,496
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
